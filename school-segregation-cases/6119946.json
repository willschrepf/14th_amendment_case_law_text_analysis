For years on end, the elected\n\nmembers of the county’s Board of Commissioners composed and delivered pointedly\n\nsectarian invocations. They rotated the prayer opportunity amongst themselves; no one\n\nelse was permitted to offer an invocation. The prayers referenced one and only one faith\n\nand veered from time to time into overt proselytization. Before each invocation, attendees\n\nwere requested to rise and often asked to pray with the commissioners. The prayers\n\nserved to open meetings of our most basic unit of government and directly preceded the\n\nbusiness session of the meeting. The district court, applying the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Town of Greece v. Galloway, 134 S. Ct. 1811 (2014), held the county’s prayer\n\npractice unconstitutional. A panel of this court reversed. See Lund v. Rowan Cty., 837\n\nF.3d 407 (4th Cir. 2016). The full court then granted rehearing en banc.\n\n       We conclude that the Constitution does not allow what happened in Rowan\n\nCounty. The prayer practice served to identify the government with Christianity and\n\nrisked conveying to citizens of minority faiths a message of exclusion. And because the\n\ncommissioners were the exclusive prayer-givers, Rowan County’s invocation practice\n\nfalls well outside the more inclusive, minister-oriented practice of legislative prayer\n\ndescribed in Town of Greece. Indeed, if elected representatives invite their constituents to\n\nparticipate in prayers invoking a single faith for meeting upon meeting, year after year, it\n\nis difficult to imagine constitutional limits to sectarian prayer practice.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       The great promise of the Establishment Clause is that religion will not operate as\n\nan instrument of division in our nation. Consistent with this principle, there is a time-\n\nhonored tradition of legislative prayer that reflects the respect of each faith for other\n\nfaiths and the aspiration, common to so many creeds, of finding higher meaning and\n\ndeeper purpose in these fleeting moments each of us spends upon this earth. Instead of\n\ndrawing on this tradition, Rowan County elevated one religion above all others and\n\naligned itself with that faith. It need not be so. As the history of legislative invocations\n\ndemonstrates, the desire of this good county for prayer at the opening of its public\n\nsessions can be realized in many ways that further both religious exercise and religious\n\ntolerance.\n\n                                              I.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       We begin by describing the challenged prayer practice itself. Rowan County,\n\nNorth Carolina is governed by an elected body known as the Rowan County Board of\n\nCommissioners. The five-member Board convenes twice a month. The commissioners sit\n\nat the front of the room facing their constituents.\n\n       Each Board meeting begins in the same way: with a prayer composed and\n\ndelivered by one of the commissioners. After calling the meeting to order, the\n\nchairperson asks everyone in attendance—commissioners and constituents alike—to\n\nstand up. All five Board members rise and bow their heads, along with most of the\n\nattendees. A commissioner then asks the community to join him in worship, using\n\nphrases such as “Let us pray,” “Let’s pray together,” or “Please pray with me.” The\n\n                                              5\n\finvocations end with a communal “Amen,” and the Pledge of Allegiance follows a\n\nmoment later. Next, the Board typically approves the previous meeting’s minutes,\n\nschedules future items of business, and holds a public comment period before continuing\n\non to the day’s work.\n\n       Board members rotate the prayer opportunity amongst themselves as a matter of\n\nlong-standing custom. The content of the prayer is “entirely at the discretion of the\n\ncommissioner.” J.A. 284. 1 No one outside the Board is permitted to offer an invocation.\n\n       The prayers are invariably and unmistakably Christian in content. Over the five-\n\nand-a-half years for which video recordings are available, 97% of the Board’s prayers\n\nmentioned “Jesus,” “Christ,” or the “Savior.” See Lund v. Rowan Cty., 103 F. Supp. 3d\n\n712, 714 (M.D.N.C. 2015). No religion other than Christianity was represented. Sectarian\n\nreferences often appeared at the conclusion of the prayer. See, e.g., S.A. 14 (prayer of\n\nApril 21, 2008) (“I ask all these things in the name of Jesus, the King of Kings and the\n\nLord of Lords. Amen.”). Several prayers confessed sin and asked for forgiveness on the\n\ncommunity’s behalf. See, e.g., S.A. 30 (prayer of August 1, 2011) (“Lord, we confess that\n\nwe have not loved you with all our heart, and mind and strength, and that we have not\n\nloved one another as Christ loves us. We have also neglected to follow the guidance of\n\nyour Holy Spirit, and have allowed sin to enter into our lives.”). Other prayers implied\n\nthat Christianity was superior to other faiths. See, e.g., S.A. 33 (prayer of March 5, 2012)\n\n(“[A]s we pick up the Cross, we will proclaim His name above all names, as the only way\n\n\n       1\n           “J.A.” refers to the Joint Appendix; “S.A.” refers to the Supplemental Appendix.\n\n                                              6\n\fto eternal life.”). On occasion, Board members appeared to implore attendees to accept\n\nChristianity. See, e.g., S.A. 21 (prayer of October 5, 2009) (“Father, I pray that all may be\n\none as you, Father, are in Jesus, and He in you. I pray that they may be one in you, that\n\nthe world may believe that you sent Jesus to save us from our sins.”).\n\n       In response to the growing controversy over the prayer practice, a number of\n\ncommissioners publicly announced that they would continue delivering Christian\n\ninvocations for the community’s benefit. Prior to the filing of this lawsuit, the American\n\nCivil Liberties Union of North Carolina Legal Foundation notified the Board that\n\nsectarian prayers violated the Establishment Clause under then-applicable Fourth Circuit\n\nprecedent. The Board did not respond, but several members stated that they would not\n\nstop praying in Jesus’ name. “[A]sking for guidance for my decisions from Jesus,” one\n\ncommissioner explained, “is the best I, and Rowan County, can ever hope for.” Lund, 103\n\nF. Supp. 3d at 715 (quoting Commissioner Ford). Another commissioner remarked, “I\n\nvolunteer to be the first to go to jail for this cause . . . .” Id. (quoting Commissioner\n\nSides). After the district court enjoined the county prayer practice, a third commissioner\n\nissued a statement noting, “I will always pray in the name of Jesus. . . . God will lead me\n\nthrough this persecution and I will be His instrument.” See Pls.’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot.\n\nSumm. J. at 9 (quoting Commissioner Barber).\n\n                                             B.\n\n       The three plaintiffs in this case are long-time residents of Rowan County. Active\n\nin the community, each one has attended multiple Board meetings to follow issues of\n\npublic importance. Nancy Lund, a volunteer tutor, cares about school funding. So does\n\n                                             7\n\fLiesa Montag-Siegel, a retired middle school librarian. Robert Voelker is interested in\n\neducation policy and the county’s provision of social services. The plaintiffs, none of\n\nwhom identify as Christian, encountered prayers of the sort described above at Board\n\nmeetings.\n\n       In March 2013, Lund and her co-plaintiffs filed this action against Rowan County,\n\nasserting that the Board’s prayer practice violated the Establishment Clause. They argued\n\nthat the Board, by delivering exclusively Christian prayers, affiliated the county with\n\nChristianity, advanced Christianity, and coerced the plaintiffs into participating in\n\nreligious exercises. According to the plaintiffs, the prayers “sen[t] a message that the\n\nCounty and the Board favor Christians” and caused the plaintiffs to feel “excluded from\n\nthe community and the local political process.” J.A. 11-12. The plaintiffs also averred\n\nthat they felt compelled to stand for the invocations to avoid sticking out. Voelker added\n\nthat he felt pressured to stand because “the invocation is immediately followed by the\n\nPledge of Allegiance, for which [he] feels strongly that he needs to stand.” J.A. 12. At\n\none meeting, Voelker proposed a nondenominational prayer and later worried that his\n\n“open questioning” of the Board’s sectarian invocations would impair his advocacy on\n\nother matters. J.A. 13. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as a\n\npreliminary injunction against sectarian prayers at Board meetings.\n\n       Rowan County responded with affidavits from each Board member adding new\n\ndetails on the prayer practice. According to these affidavits, the Board has no written\n\npolicy on the invocations. The commissioners also claimed that the Board has “no\n\nexpectation . . . regarding the form or content” of the prayers, J.A. 291, which are offered\n\n                                             8\n\f“for the edification and benefit of the commissioners and to solemnize the meeting,” J.A.\n\n293. Finally, the affidavits clarified that attendees may leave the room or arrive after the\n\ninvocation and that the Board “respects the right of any citizen” to remain seated or\n\ndisregard the invocation. J.A. 277.\n\n       After the district court preliminarily enjoined the Board from delivering sectarian\n\nprayers, the Supreme Court decided Town of Greece v. Galloway. The Court upheld the\n\ntown’s practice of opening its legislative sessions with sectarian prayers and ruled that\n\nsectarian prayers, while subject to some limits, are constitutional as a general matter.\n\n       In light of Town of Greece, both the plaintiffs and Rowan County moved for\n\nsummary judgment. The district court held that Rowan County’s prayer practice\n\nremained unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction. Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at\n\n733-34. The court found that the practice was unconstitutionally coercive and “deviate[d]\n\nfrom the long-standing history and tradition” of legislative prayer. Id. at 723. That\n\ntradition, as articulated by the Supreme Court, involved the delivery of prayers by “a\n\nchaplain, separate from the legislative body.” Id. Here, the court reasoned, the prayers\n\nwere “exclusively prepared and controlled” and delivered by the government,\n\n“constituting a much greater and more intimate government involvement in the prayer\n\npractice than that at issue in Town of Greece.” Id. Further, restricting the prayer\n\nopportunity to the Board resulted in “a closed-universe of prayer-givers . . . who favored\n\nreligious beliefs believed to be common to the majority of voters in Rowan County.” Id.\n\nThe district court noted that although lawmaker-led prayer “is not per se\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\funconstitutional,” the prayer-giver’s identity is relevant to the constitutional inquiry “in\n\nrelation to the surrounding circumstances.” Id. at 722 n.4.\n\n       On appeal, this court reversed the district court’s judgment and upheld the\n\ncounty’s prayer practice. Lund, 837 F.3d at 411-31. The panel majority recognized that\n\n“[t]he five commissioners, all Christian, ‘maintain[ed] exclusive and complete control\n\nover the content of the prayers.’” Id. at 434 (quoting Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 733).\n\nNonetheless, the majority held that the identity of the prayer-giver was not “a significant\n\nconstitutional distinction, at least in the context of this case.” Id. at 420. Having\n\ndiscounted the source of the prayer as a relevant consideration, the majority next\n\nexamined the other elements of the Board’s practice seriatim. The majority held that the\n\npractice was consistent with tradition as outlined in Town of Greece and was not\n\ncoercive. Id. at 430.\n\n       Judge Wilkinson dissented. The dissent argued that the “combination of legislators\n\nas the sole prayer-givers, official invitation for audience participation, consistently\n\nsectarian prayers referencing but a single faith, and the intimacy of a local governmental\n\nsetting exceed[ed] even a broad reading of Town of Greece.” Id. at 431 (Wilkinson, J.,\n\ndissenting) (hereinafter panel dissent). After examining “the interaction among elements\n\nspecific to this case,” id. at 433, the dissent concluded that the county’s prayer practice\n\nwas unconstitutional.\n\n       We granted rehearing en banc, and we now affirm. Reviewing the district court’s\n\ndecision de novo, see Simpson v. Chesterfield Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, 404 F.3d 276, 280\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f(4th Cir. 2005), we hold that Rowan County’s prayer practice violated the Establishment\n\nClause of the First Amendment.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      “[A] moment of prayer or quiet reflection sets the mind[s] [of legislators] to a\n\nhigher purpose and thereby eases the task of governing.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n1825 (plurality opinion). Legislative prayer “lends gravity to public business, reminds\n\nlawmakers to transcend petty differences in pursuit of a higher purpose, and expresses a\n\ncommon aspiration to a just and peaceful society.” Id. at 1818 (majority opinion). Owing\n\nto its unique history and longstanding role in public life, legislative prayer occupies “a\n\nfield of Establishment Clause jurisprudence with its own set of boundaries and\n\nguidelines.” Simpson, 404 F.3d at 281. 2\n\n      But the general principles animating the Establishment Clause remain relevant\n\neven in the context of legislative prayer. First, the Constitution “affirmatively mandates\n\naccommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any.”\n\nLynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 673 (1984). Second, the government “may not coerce\n\nanyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way\n\nwhich ‘establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.’” Lee v.\n\nWeisman, 505 U.S. 577, 587 (1992) (quoting Lynch, 465 U.S. at 678). By “ensuring\n\ngovernmental neutrality in matters of religion,” Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437,\n\n\n      2\n        The term “legislative prayer” refers to offering an invocation to open government\nmeetings, while “lawmaker-led prayer” or “legislator-led prayer” denotes a subset of\ninvocations delivered by members of the legislative body.\n\n                                           11\n\f449 (1971), the Establishment Clause safeguards religious liberty and wards off “political\n\ndivision along religious lines,” Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 622 (1971). An\n\ninstrument of social peace, the Establishment Clause does not become less so when social\n\nrancor runs exceptionally high.\n\n       In addition, “[b]y pairing the Free Exercise Clause with the Establishment\n\nClause,” the Framers sought to prevent government from choosing sides on matters of\n\nfaith and to protect religious minorities from exclusion or punishment at the hands of the\n\nstate. Lund, 837 F.3d at 438 (panel dissent). “Americans are encouraged to practice and\n\ncelebrate their faith but not to establish it through the state.” Id.\n\n       In the legislative prayer context, the Supreme Court has given meaning to the\n\nabstract guarantees of the Establishment Clause by considering “historical practices and\n\nunderstandings.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThis history “shed[s] light on how the Founders viewed the Establishment Clause in\n\nrelation to legislative prayer.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 414. The resulting principles, first\n\nelucidated in Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983), and refined in Town of Greece,\n\nreflect “what history reveals was the contemporaneous understanding” of the\n\nEstablishment Clause. Lynch, 465 U.S. at 673.\n\n       Marsh and Town of Greece, however, in no way sought to dictate the outcome of\n\nevery subsequent case. The Court acknowledged that it has not “define[d] the precise\n\nboundary of the Establishment Clause.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819.\n\nAccordingly, when the historical principles articulated by the Supreme Court do not\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fdirect a particular result, a court must conduct a “fact-sensitive” review of the prayer\n\npractice. Id. at 1825 (plurality opinion).\n\n       Marsh and Town of Greece do not settle whether Rowan County’s prayer practice\n\nis constitutional. Those decisions did not concern lawmaker-led prayer, nor did they\n\ninvolve the other unusual aspects of the county’s prayer practice. And they certainly did\n\nnot address the confluence of these elements. That said, Marsh and Town of Greece\n\nprovide our doctrinal starting point. We shall begin by describing the principles they\n\ndeveloped and then proceed to apply those principles to this case.\n\n                                             A.\n\n       In Marsh v. Chambers, the Supreme Court upheld the Nebraska legislature’s\n\npractice of opening its sessions with nonsectarian prayers delivered by a paid chaplain.\n\n463 U.S. at 793 n. 14. The Court noted that legislative prayer “has coexisted with the\n\nprinciples of disestablishment and religious freedom” since the colonial period. Id. at\n\n786. In addition, the First Congress “authorized the appointment of paid chaplains”\n\nshortly after finalizing language for the First Amendment. Id. at 788. Accordingly, the\n\nCourt reasoned, the Framers could not have viewed “paid legislative chaplains and\n\nopening prayers as a violation of that Amendment.” Id.\n\n       Marsh, then, stands for the principle that “legislative prayer, while religious in\n\nnature, has long been understood as compatible with the Establishment Clause.” Town of\n\nGreece, 134 S. Ct. at 1818. But even as the Court concluded that legislative prayer is\n\nconstitutional as a general matter, Marsh recognized certain limits on the practice.\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fNamely, the prayer opportunity may not be “exploited to proselytize or advance [a\n\nparticular faith] or to disparage any other.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 794-95.\n\n       Thirty years later, in Town of Greece v. Galloway, the Court held that sectarian\n\nprayer is not by itself unconstitutional. 134 S. Ct. at 1820. In that case, the town board in\n\nGreece, New York began its monthly meetings with sectarian invocations given by\n\nvolunteer guest ministers. Id. at 1816. Because “nearly all of the congregations in town\n\nturned out to be Christian,” most of the ministers were Christian too. Id. at 1824.\n\nNonetheless, the town also invited a Jewish layman and Baha’i practitioner to deliver\n\nprayers and granted a Wiccan priestess’s request to do so. Id. at 1817. The town “neither\n\nreviewed the prayers in advance of the meetings nor provided guidance as to their tone or\n\ncontent.” Id. at 1816.\n\n       Invoking the historical tradition first described in Marsh, the Court held that the\n\nEstablishment Clause does not require “nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single,\n\nfixed standard.” Id. at 1820. As a result, “a challenge based solely on the content of a\n\nprayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation.” Id. at 1824 (emphasis added).\n\n       At the same time, the Court was quick to clarify that invocation content is still\n\ngermane to the constitutionality of a prayer practice. The “relevant constraint” on faith-\n\nspecific prayer “derives from its place at the opening of legislative sessions, where it is\n\nmeant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of the Nation’s\n\nheritage.” Id. at 1823. Prayer that “invites lawmakers to reflect upon shared ideals and\n\ncommon ends before they embark on the fractious business of governing” serves that\n\npurpose. Id. But the Establishment Clause does not countenance prayers that “denigrate\n\n                                             14\n\fnonbelievers or religious minorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion” or, per\n\nMarsh, prayers that proselytize or advance or disparage a particular faith. Id.\n\n       Applying these principles, the Court concluded that the sectarian prayers offered\n\nby guest ministers fell within the historical tradition outlined in Marsh. Id. at 1824. The\n\nCourt also emphasized that Greece selected chaplains without discriminating among\n\nfaiths and “welcome[d] a prayer by any minister or layman who wished to give one.” Id.\n\n       Finally, the Court concluded that the town’s prayer practice did not coerce\n\nparticipation by meeting attendees. Id. at 1828. While no single test commanded a\n\nmajority, Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the plurality explained that “[t]he analysis would\n\nbe different if town board members directed the public to participate in the prayers,\n\nsingled out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicated that their decisions might be\n\ninfluenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity.” Id. at 1826.\n\n                                             B.\n\n       Marsh and Town of Greece thus show a Court generally supportive of legislative\n\nprayer, careful to emphasize that sectarian references are permissible in proper context,\n\nbut cautioning that the prayer opportunity not get out of hand. This case differs from\n\nMarsh and Town of Greece in two crucial respects that, in combination with other aspects\n\nof the Board’s prayers, give rise to an unprecedented prayer practice. First, whereas guest\n\nministers delivered the prayers in those cases, the legislators themselves gave the\n\ninvocations in Rowan County. Second, the prayer opportunity here was exclusively\n\nreserved for the commissioners, creating a “closed-universe” of prayer-givers. Lund, 103\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fF. Supp. 3d at 723. This case is therefore “more than a factual wrinkle on Town of\n\nGreece.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 431 (panel dissent). “It is a conceptual world apart.” Id.\n\n       To begin, Town of Greece simply does not address the constitutionality of\n\nlawmaker-led prayer. The Court has “consistently discussed legislative prayer practices\n\nin terms of invited ministers, clergy, or volunteers providing the prayer.” Lund, 103 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 722. And in elaborating on our national tradition of legislative prayer—the\n\nhistory informing its interpretation of the Establishment Clause—the Court has “not once\n\ndescribed a situation in which the legislators themselves gave the invocation.” Id. Town\n\nof Greece instead recounts how “[t]he First Congress made it an early item of business to\n\nappoint and pay official chaplains,” adding that “both the House and Senate have\n\nmaintained the office virtually uninterrupted since that time.” 134 S. Ct. at 1818\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       To the extent that Town of Greece touches on the constitutional relevance of the\n\nprayer-giver’s identity, the decision takes for granted the use of outside clergy. The Court\n\nemphasized that the town “neither edit[ed] [n]or approv[ed] prayers” offered by the guest\n\nministers. Id. at 1822. Addressing the fact that attendees were asked to stand, the plurality\n\nreasoned that “[t]hese requests . . . came not from town leaders but from the guest\n\nministers, who presumably are accustomed to directing their congregations in this way.”\n\nId. at 1826. And “[t]he inclusion of a brief, ceremonial prayer as part of a larger exercise\n\nin civic recognition,” the plurality explained, “suggests that its purpose and effect are to\n\nacknowledge religious leaders and the institutions they represent.” Id. at 1827.\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       Thus the historical “practice of prayer,” at least as described by the Supreme\n\nCourt, is not entirely “similar to that now challenged.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 791. In Rowan\n\nCounty, the commissioners themselves, not guest ministers, led the community in prayer,\n\nand they composed each invocation “according to their personal faiths.” Lund, 103 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 724; see J.A. 275-94 (affidavits of the commissioners). Relative to Town of\n\nGreece, the county’s prayer practice featured “much greater and more intimate\n\ngovernment involvement.” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 723. The conspicuous absence of\n\ncase law on lawmaker-led prayer is likely no accident. As elaborated below, this type of\n\nprayer both identifies the government with religion more strongly than ordinary\n\ninvocations and heightens the constitutional risks posed by requests to participate and by\n\nsectarian prayers.\n\n       This is especially true where legislators are the only eligible prayer-givers. Both\n\nTown of Greece and Marsh involved open, inclusive prayer opportunities. In the former\n\ncase, the town “at no point excluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be prayer\n\ngiver,” and town leaders affirmed that “a minister or layperson of any persuasion,\n\nincluding an atheist, could give the invocation.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1816.\n\nMarsh emphasized that the ordinary chaplain “was not the only clergyman heard by the\n\nLegislature; guest chaplains . . . officiated at the request of various legislators and as\n\nsubstitutes during [the regular chaplain’s] absences.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 793. The\n\nopenness evinced by these other elected bodies contrasts starkly with Rowan County’s\n\npolicy of restricting the prayer opportunity to the commissioners alone.\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f       Marsh and Town of Greece, while supportive of legislative prayer, were measured\n\nand balanced decisions. See 134 S. Ct. at 1824-25 (describing the proper inquiry as “fact-\n\nsensitive” and the analysis as “an inquiry into the prayer opportunity as a whole”). The\n\ndissents in this case, by contrast, are wholly bereft of any sense of balance. Any balanced\n\nassessment of Marsh and Town of Greece makes clear the dissents’ lack of fidelity to\n\nthose decisions. The dissents’ reading of Town of Greece is faithful only to what the\n\ndissents wish that opinion would say, not to what it actually said. As Town of Greece\n\nmakes plain, the Court has never approved anything like what has transpired here or\n\nanything resembling the dissents’ invitation to local government to work sectarian\n\npractices into public meetings in whatever manner it wishes. Id. at 1826. Rather Town of\n\nGreece told the inferior federal courts to do exactly what the majority has done here—\n\nthat is to grant local governments leeway in designing a prayer practice that brings the\n\nvalues of religious solemnity and higher meaning to public meetings, but at the same time\n\nto recognize that there remain situations that in their totality exceed what Town of Greece\n\nidentified as permissible bounds. It is the dissents’ unwillingness to identify any\n\nmeaningful limit to any sort of sectarian prayer practice in local governmental functions\n\nthat draws their fidelity to Town of Greece into serious question.\n\n                                            C.\n\n       The county, bolstered by amici, argues that there is “a long tradition of opening\n\nlegislative sessions—at all levels of government—with prayer by legislators themselves.”\n\nSupp. Br. of Appellant at 3. Members of Congress have occasionally delivered\n\ninvocations in the Senate and House of Representatives. See Br. of Amici Curiae\n\n                                            18\n\fMembers of Congress at 6. The state amici, drawing on a national survey, assert that a\n\nmajority of state legislatures allow lawmakers to offer invocations “on at least some\n\noccasions,” including seven of the ten state legislative chambers in the Fourth Circuit. Br.\n\nof Amici Curiae State of West Virginia and 12 Other States at 13-14. Many county and\n\ncity governments also permit elected officials to deliver invocations. Id. at 15. Setting\n\naside the question of whether contemporaneous practices provide compelling evidence of\n\nhistorical tradition, it is clear that lawmaker-led prayer is far from rare.\n\n       The evidence collected by Rowan County and amici, however, only reinforces our\n\nconclusion that the county’s prayer practice falls outside the tradition of legislative prayer\n\nelaborated in Marsh and Town of Greece. First, while lawmakers may occasionally lead\n\nan invocation, this phenomenon appears to be the exception to the rule, at least at the\n\nstate and federal levels. Amici members of Congress note that “Senators have, from time\n\nto time, delivered the prayer,” but that “[m]embers routinely invite guest ministers” to\n\noffer the invocation. Br. of Amici Curiae Members of Congress at 6-7 (citations omitted).\n\nThe survey cited by the state amici clarifies that “it is a tradition for a chaplain to be\n\nselected to serve the [legislative] body.” National Conference of State Legislatures,\n\nInside the Legislative Process 5-147 (2002) (hereinafter NCSL Survey). Twenty-seven\n\nstate legislative chambers designate an official chaplain. Id. Seventy-nine invite “visiting\n\nchaplains [who] usually rotate among religions.” Id. Second, Rowan County and amici\n\nelide the distinction between extending the prayer opportunity to lawmakers (as many\n\nlegislatures do) and restricting it to those lawmakers (as Rowan County did here). For the\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\freasons we discuss below, the latter approach poses greater risks under the Establishment\n\nClause.\n\n       In marshaling the historical and contemporaneous evidence of lawmaker-led\n\nprayer, Rowan County and its amici are waging war against a phantom. The plaintiffs\n\nhave never contended that the Establishment Clause prohibits legislators from giving\n\ninvocations, nor did the district court so conclude. See Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 722 n.4\n\n(“[T]he Commissioners’ provision of prayers is not per se unconstitutional. . . . Under a\n\ndifferent, inclusive prayer practice, Commissioners might be able to provide\n\nprayers . . . .”). Like the plaintiffs and the district court, we “would not for a moment cast\n\nall legislator-led prayer as constitutionally suspect.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 433 (panel\n\ndissent). Religious faith is “a source of personal guidance, strength, and comfort.” Id. at\n\n431. And legislative prayer’s “solemnizing effect for lawmakers is likely heightened\n\nwhen they personally utter the prayer.” Id. at 433. Accordingly, the Establishment Clause\n\nindeed allows lawmakers to deliver invocations in appropriate circumstances. Legislator-\n\nled prayer is not inherently unconstitutional.\n\n       We simply conclude, as the district court did, that the identity of the prayer-giver\n\nis relevant to the constitutional inquiry. Establishment Clause questions are by their\n\nnature “matter[s] of degree,” presupposing some acceptable practices and others that\n\ncross the line. Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677, 704 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in\n\nthe judgment); see also Lynch, 465 U.S. at 678-79 (“In each case, the inquiry calls for\n\nline drawing; no fixed, per se rule can be framed. . . . The line between permissible\n\nrelationships and those barred by the [Establishment] Clause can no more be straight and\n\n                                             20\n\funwavering than due process can be defined in a single stroke or phrase or test.”). Prayers\n\nled by lawmakers, like sectarian prayers, may violate the Establishment Clause in some\n\ncircumstances. And just as sectarian prayer has its limits, so, too, does legislator-led\n\nprayer.\n\n       Within the universe of prayers delivered by legislators, the constitutionality of a\n\nparticular government’s approach ultimately will depend on other aspects of the prayer\n\npractice. In fact, the very survey proffered by state amici illustrates the importance of\n\nviewing lawmaker-led prayer in context. The survey recommends that the prayer-giver\n\n“be especially sensitive to expressions that may be unsuitable to members of some faiths”\n\nwhen “opening and closing the prayer.” NCSL Survey at 5-146. Because legislator-led\n\ninvocations vary so widely, “[w]e cannot discern from the general survey proffered by\n\namici which prayers were primarily for the benefit of legislators or commissioners as in\n\nTown of Greece and which focused, as the prayers did here, on requesting the citizens at\n\nthe meeting to pray.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 433 (panel dissent). “Nor do we know from the\n\nsurvey what percentage of prayers given by elected officials generally contain sectarian\n\nreferences or proselytizing exhortations, or which are non-denominational or delivered by\n\nlegislators of diverse faiths.” Id.\n\n       In sum, the elected members of Rowan County’s Board of Commissioners\n\ncomposed and delivered their own sectarian prayers featuring but a single faith. They\n\nprevented anyone else from offering invocations. The Board’s prayer practice thus pushes\n\nthis case well outside the confines of Town of Greece and indeed outside the realm of\n\nlawmaker-led prayer itself. To see just how far outside those boundaries the prayer\n\n                                            21\n\fpractice was, we must turn to the operation of the practice itself. Because Town of Greece\n\ndoes not resolve this challenge, we must decide whether the county’s prayer practice,\n\ntaken as a whole, exceeded constitutional limits on legislative prayer.\n\n                                             III.\n\n       “[W]hen a seat of government begins to resemble a house of worship, the values\n\nof religious observance are put at risk, and the danger of religious division rises\n\naccordingly.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 431 (panel dissent). That is why “[t]he clearest command\n\nof the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially\n\npreferred over another.” Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982). Rowan County’s\n\nprayer practice violated this maxim by so clearly identifying the government with a\n\nparticular faith.\n\n       Courts adjudicating a challenge to legislative prayer inquire “into the prayer\n\nopportunity as a whole, rather than into the contents of a single prayer.” Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1824. They must conduct a “fact-sensitive” review of “the setting in which\n\nthe prayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed,” id. at 1825 (plurality opinion),\n\nas well as “the pattern of prayers over time,” id. at 1827.\n\n       As the exclusive prayer-givers, Rowan County’s elected representatives—the very\n\nembodiment of the state—delivered sectarian invocations referencing one and only one\n\nreligion. They asked their constituents to join them in worship. They did so at every\n\nmeeting of a local governing body for many years. We examine each of these features in\n\nturn: commissioners as the sole prayer-givers; invocations that drew exclusively on\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\fChristianity and sometimes served to advance that faith; invitations to attendees to\n\nparticipate; and the local government setting.\n\n       To respect the Supreme Court’s insistence on a fact-sensitive inquiry, we must\n\nalso pay close attention to the interplay between the various facets of the county’s prayer\n\npractice. As previously noted, the invocations here were written and given by elected\n\nrepresentatives acting in their official capacity. This fact interacts with the other aspects\n\nof the county’s practice, altering their constitutional significance. Accordingly, we must\n\nevaluate these other elements through the lens of the prayer-giver’s identity. We conclude\n\nthat it is the combination of these elements—not any particular feature alone—that\n\n“threatens to blur the line between church and state to a degree unimaginable in Town of\n\nGreece.” Lund, 837 F. 3d at 435 (panel dissent).\n\n                                             A.\n\n       “It is a cornerstone principle of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence that ‘it is\n\nno part of the business of government to compose official prayers . . . .’” Lee, 505 U.S. at\n\n588 (quoting Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 425 (1962)). The government “is without\n\npower to prescribe . . . any particular form of prayer which is to be used as an official\n\nprayer in carrying on any program of governmentally sponsored religious activity.”\n\nEngel, 370 U.S. at 430. The Court reiterated this foundational point in Town of Greece:\n\n“Our Government is prohibited from prescribing prayers to be recited in our public\n\ninstitutions in order to promote a preferred system of belief or code of moral behavior.”\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1822.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f       But that is precisely what happened in Rowan County, where the five\n\ncommissioners “maintain[ed] exclusive and complete control over the content of the\n\nprayers.” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 733. In Marsh, the prayer-giver was paid by the state.\n\nIn Town of Greece, the prayer-giver was invited by the state. But in Rowan County, the\n\nprayer-giver was the state itself. The Board was thus “elbow-deep in the activities banned\n\nby the Establishment Clause—selecting and prescribing sectarian prayers.” Lund, 837\n\nF.3d at 434 (panel dissent).\n\n       By arrogating the prayer opportunity to itself, the Board also restricted the number\n\nof faiths that could be referenced at its meetings. When guests are allowed to deliver\n\ninvocations, as in Marsh and Town of Greece, legislators can easily expand the religions\n\nrepresented (perhaps in response to requests or on their own initiative). In upholding\n\nsectarian prayer, Town of Greece emphasized that legislatures are typically able and\n\nwilling to accommodate diverse faiths. The way to acknowledge “our growing diversity,”\n\nthe Court suggested, is “not by proscribing sectarian content but by welcoming ministers\n\nof many creeds.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1820-21 (citing congressional prayers\n\nreferencing Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism).\n\n       Compare the county’s rigid, restrictive practice with the more flexible, inclusive\n\napproach upheld in Town of Greece. Greece welcomed adherents of all faiths, allowing\n\n“any member of the public [the chance] to offer an invocation reflecting his or her own\n\nconvictions.” Id. at 1826 (plurality opinion). Most of the guest ministers were Christian,\n\nowing to the fact that “nearly all of the congregations in town turned out to be Christian.”\n\nId. at 1824 (majority opinion). To address complaints, however, the town “invited a\n\n                                            24\n\fJewish layman and the chairman of the local Baha’i temple to deliver prayers” and\n\ngranted a Wiccan priestess’s request to participate. Id. at 1817. By opening its prayer\n\nopportunity to all comers, the town cultivated an atmosphere of greater tolerance and\n\ninclusion.\n\n       Rowan County regrettably sent the opposite message. Instead of embracing\n\nreligious pluralism and the possibility of a correspondingly diverse invocation practice,\n\nRowan County’s commissioners created a “closed-universe” of prayer-givers dependent\n\nsolely on election outcomes. Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 723. The commissioners\n\neffectively insulated themselves from requests to diversify prayer content. And we cannot\n\noverlook the fact that the decision to restrict the prayer opportunity to the commissioners\n\nwas not made by the citizens of Rowan County or some disinterested group but\n\nperpetuated by the commissioners themselves—all of whom identify as Protestant\n\nChristian. See J.A. 275 (United Methodist); J.A. 287 (same); J.A. 279 (Independent\n\nBaptist); J.A. 291 (same); J.A. 283 (Southern Baptist).\n\n       For any Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, or others who sought some\n\nmodest place for their own faith or at least some less insistent invocation of the majority\n\nfaith, the only recourse available was to elect a commissioner with similar religious\n\nviews. See Br. of Appellant at 26. We find this point troubling. “[V]oters may wonder\n\nwhat kind of prayer a candidate of a minority religious persuasion would select if elected.\n\nFailure to pray in the name of the prevailing faith risks becoming a campaign issue or a\n\ntacit political debit, which in turn deters those of minority faiths from seeking office.”\n\nLund, 837 F.3d at 435 (panel dissent). Further, allowing the county to restrict to one the\n\n                                            25\n\fnumber of faiths represented at Board meetings would warp our inclusive tradition of\n\nlegislative prayer into a zero-sum game of competing religious factions. Our Constitution\n\nsafeguards religious pluralism; it does not sanction activity which would take us “one\n\nstep closer to a de facto religious litmus test for public office.” Id.\n\n       Finally, we note that the risk of political division stemming from prayer practice\n\nconflict is no mere abstract matter. At one meeting, an individual who “expressed\n\nopposition to the Board’s prayer practice” was booed and jeered by the audience. Lund,\n\n103 F. Supp. 3d at 729. In addition, the prayer practice became a campaign issue in the\n\n2016 Board elections. The two incumbent commissioners favored continuing the\n\ncounty’s defense of the prayer practice, while two challengers opposed it. See Supp. Br.\n\nof Appellees at 16 n.6. The incumbents ultimately prevailed. Id. Almost four decades\n\nago, the Supreme Court cautioned that “political division along religious lines . . . is a\n\nthreat to the normal political process,” and is therefore “one of the principal evils against\n\nwhich the First Amendment was intended to protect.” Lemon, 403 U.S. at 622. Time has\n\ndone nothing to diminish the salience of this warning.\n\n                                               B.\n\n       Having structured the prayer opportunity so that Board members alone could give\n\nvoice to their religious convictions, the commissioners unceasingly and exclusively\n\ninvoked Christianity. Even more problematic, the prayer practice at times “promote[d]”\n\nChristianity, the commissioners’ “preferred system of belief.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct.\n\nat 1822.\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\f       Rowan County makes the entirely fair point that courts must not become censors\n\nof public prayer. The Supreme Court echoed this concern, warning courts away from\n\nbecoming “supervisors and censors of religious speech.” Id. A single prayer will thus not\n\n“despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and embraces our tradition” of legislative\n\nprayer. Id. at 1824. At the same time, however, courts must decide the case before them,\n\nwhich cannot be done without “review[ing] the pattern of prayers over time.” Id. at 1826-\n\n27 (plurality opinion). Where even the most cursory look reveals a constitutionally\n\nproblematic prayer practice, courts have no choice but to examine the entire record,\n\nwhich of course includes the invocations. A proper sensitivity toward the dangers of\n\njudicial overreach in this area cannot divest us of a duty which if not performed would\n\ngrant free rein to governmental sectarian abuse.\n\n       The lead dissent decries this inquiry as “judicial review run amok.” 3 Infra Lead\n\nDissent at 98. But while judicial review of prayer practices might indeed pose a danger in\n\nsome instances, there is no danger here. Every single individual in Rowan County\n\nremains free to pray as he or she sees fit and in the individual or collective setting that he\n\nor she finds most meaningful. What government is not free to do, however, is link itself\n\npersistently and relentlessly to a single faith. See Larson, 456 U.S. at 244 (“The clearest\n\ncommand of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be\n\nofficially preferred over another.”). This evident an identification of the state with one\n\nand only one faith is not, we repeat, some marginal or peripheral constitutional violation\n\n\n       3\n           The lead dissent refers to Judge Agee’s dissent.\n\n                                              27\n\fthat we can just shrug off and wish away. For to do so here would wish away the\n\nEstablishment Clause itself. The overwhelming majority of the Board’s invocations\n\nreferenced tenets of Christianity. Over a period of more than five years, only 4 of 143\n\nprayers were non-sectarian. Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 714. The remaining 139 prayers, or\n\n97%, “use[d] ideas or images identified with [Christianity],” Lee, 505 U.S. at 588, such\n\nas “Jesus,” “Christ,” or the “Savior,” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 714. No other religion was\n\never represented in the invocations. Id. Sectarian references were especially common at\n\nthe conclusion of the prayer. To list but a few representative examples: “I ask this in the\n\nname of the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ,” S.A. 33 (prayer of March 5,\n\n2012); “[I] ask these things in the name of Jesus and for the sake of His Kingdom,” S.A.\n\n15 (prayer of June 2, 2008); “For the sake of your Son, our Savior, the Lord Jesus\n\nChrist,” S.A. 31 (prayer of October 3, 2011); and “In Jesus’ name we pray,” S.A. 22\n\n(prayer of November 16, 2009). Several invocations delved into the finer points of\n\nChristian theology. One prayer during the holiday season began, “[W]e’d like to thank\n\nyou for the Virgin Birth, we’d like to thank you for the Cross at Calvary, and we’d like to\n\nthank you for the resurrection.” S.A. 12 (prayer of December 3, 2007). Another\n\nremarked, “Father God, . . . [w]e thank you so much for sending your Son Jesus Christ to\n\nthis world, and we always remember that this time of year, Lord, and we should\n\nremember it always.” S.A. 27 (prayer of December 6, 2010).\n\n       Town of Greece instructs courts to consider a prayer practice from the perspective\n\nof the “reasonable observer,” who is presumed to be “acquainted with [the] tradition” of\n\nlegislative prayer. 134 S. Ct. at 1825 (plurality opinion). Although “adult citizens, firm in\n\n                                             28\n\ftheir own beliefs, can tolerate and perhaps appreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a\n\nperson of a different faith,” id. at 1823 (majority opinion), the “reasonable observer”—or\n\neven the exceptionally well-informed citizen steeped in the Court’s legislative prayer\n\njurisprudence—would be surprised to find exclusively sectarian invocations being\n\ndelivered exclusively by the commissioners because, as noted, the Court has consistently\n\nspoken in terms of guest ministers and outside volunteers.\n\n       In addition, as noted, no religion other than Christianity was ever represented at\n\nBoard meetings. “When the state’s representatives so emphatically evoke a single\n\nreligion in nearly every prayer over a period of many years, that faith comes to be\n\nperceived as the one true faith, not merely of individual prayer-givers, but of government\n\nitself.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 434 (panel dissent). Faced with this unchanging tableau,\n\nattendees must have come to the inescapable conclusion that the Board “favors one faith\n\nand one faith only.” Id. at 435. This was the inference drawn by the plaintiffs, who\n\ndescribed their sense of separation from their own government and the political process\n\nitself. See S.A. 1-10 (affidavits of the plaintiffs).\n\n       It is not necessary, of course, for governments to go out of their way “to achieve\n\nreligious balancing” in prayer content or to represent some minimum number of faiths.\n\nTown of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824. But in considering whether government has aligned\n\nitself with a particular religion, a tapestry of many faiths lessens that risk whereas\n\ninvoking only one exacerbates it. Here, the Board’s practice created the perception that\n\nRowan County had taken sides on questions of faith.\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\f       Not only did the Board’s invocations convey its singular approval of Christianity,\n\nthe prayer opportunity on occasion served to advance that faith. The tradition of\n\nlegislative prayer elaborated in Town of Greece was composed of prayers that “reflect\n\nupon shared ideals and common ends” and that “strive for the idea that people of many\n\nfaiths may be united in a community of tolerance and devotion,” using sectarian\n\n“religious themes [as] particular means to [these] universal ends.” Id. at 1823. In contrast,\n\nthe Establishment Clause does not condone a prayer practice that “over time is . . .\n\n‘exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.’”\n\nId. (quoting Marsh, 463 U.S. at 794-95).\n\n       On multiple occasions, the invocations crossed the line from “reflect[ing] upon\n\nshared ideals and common ends,” id. at 1823, to “promot[ing] a preferred system of\n\nbelief,” id. at 1822. To begin, several prayers purported to confess spiritual shortcomings\n\non the community’s behalf. Consider the following examples:\n\n   • “Although you sent Jesus to be Savior of the world, we confess that we\n     treat Him as our own personal God. Although you are one, and the body of\n     Christ is one, we fail to display that unity in our worship, our mission, and\n     our fellowship.” S.A. 31 (prayer of October 3, 2011).\n\n   • “Lord, we confess that we have not loved you with all our heart, and mind\n     and strength, and that we have not loved one another as Christ loves us. We\n     have also neglected to follow the guidance of your Holy Spirit, and have\n     allowed sin to enter into our lives.” S.A. 30 (prayer of August 1, 2011).\n\n   • “God of healing mercies, we come to you this day confessing that we are an\n     imperfect people. . . . We acknowledge that we’ve been given the pathway\n     to peace, in the witness of Jesus Christ . . . . [But] oftentimes we have failed\n     to witness on Earth.” S.A. 26 (prayer of August 16, 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\fBy portraying the failure to love Jesus or follow his teachings as spiritual defects, the\n\nprayers implicitly “signal[ed] disfavor toward” non-Christians. Town of Greece, 134 S.\n\nCt. at 1826 (plurality opinion).\n\n       Multiple prayers characterized Christianity as “the one and only way to salvation,”\n\nS.A. 15 (prayer of August 18, 2008), thus implying that adherents of other faiths were in\n\nsome ways condemned. For example, one commissioner unequivocally stated that “we do\n\nbelieve that there is only one way to salvation, and that is Jesus Christ.” S.A. 12 (prayer\n\nof December 3, 2007); see also S.A. 13 (prayer of February 18, 2008) (“I ask all these\n\nthings in the name of Jesus, the one and only way to salvation.”).\n\n       The record is replete with other invocations proclaiming that Christianity is\n\nexceptional and suggesting that other faiths are inferior. This message risks\n\n“denigrat[ing] nonbelievers [and] religious minorities.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n1823. Consider the following inexhaustive survey:\n\n   • “We have been blessed to be the recipients of your immeasurable grace. We\n     can’t be defeated, we can’t be destroyed, and we can’t be denied because\n     we are going to live forever with you through the salvation of Jesus Christ. .\n     . . And as we pick up the Cross, we will proclaim His name above all\n     names, as the only way to eternal life.” S.A. 33 (prayer of March 5, 2012).\n\n   • “We can’t be defeated, we can’t be destroyed, and we won’t be denied,\n     because of our salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.” S.A. 19 (prayer of\n     May 18, 2009).\n\n   • “You saved us and you call us with the holy calling. We are the recipients\n     of your immeasurable grace and glory. We are the richest people in the\n     world. . . . [W]e’re going to live forever with Him.” S.A. 15 (prayer of June\n     2, 2008).\n\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\f       Finally, several prayers urged attendees to embrace Christianity, thereby\n\n“preach[ing] conversion.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1823. One invocation advocated\n\nthat the community take up the Christian faith:\n\n       Father, I pray that all may be one as you, Father, are in Jesus, and He in\n       you. I pray that they may be one in you, that the world may believe that you\n       sent Jesus to save us from our sins. May we hunger and thirst for\n       righteousness, be made perfect in holiness, and be preserved, whole and\n       entire, spirit, soul, and body, irreproachable at the coming of our Lord Jesus\n       Christ.\nS.A. 21 (prayer of October 5, 2009). “Holy Spirit,” went another prayer, “open our hearts\n\nto Christ’s teachings, and enable us to spread His message amongst the people we know\n\nand love through the applying of the sacred words in our everyday lives.” S.A. 28 (prayer\n\nof March 7, 2011).\n\n       Religious faith has both doctrinal and ecumenical features. The doctrinal aspects\n\nof religion, most often expressed in religious services, signify the ideas and rituals that\n\nmake religions distinctive. Doctrine can lend strength, cohesion, comfort, and spiritual\n\ndepth to religious communities. The ecumenical aspects of faith, by contrast, draw on the\n\nbeliefs shared by many different creeds and “widely held among the people of this\n\ncountry.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 792. Central among these beliefs is faith in a higher\n\nprovidence that lends meaning and purpose to our life on earth and encourages us to\n\nembrace our common humanity and to strive for the best versions of ourselves. At its\n\nbest, legislative prayer gives voice to the ecumenical dimensions of religious faith.\n\nInvocations that, like the above examples, hone too sharply in on doctrinal distinctions,\n\nrisk “the divisiveness the Establishment Clause seeks rightly to avoid.” Simpson, 404\n\n\n                                            32\n\fF.3d at 284. Prayer that would be welcome and moving to the faithful in so many a\n\nsetting ought to in some way become welcoming to others where the powers of\n\ngovernment are implicated and persons of diverse faiths are involved.\n\n       Two serious harms arise “[w]hen the power [and] prestige . . . of government is\n\nplaced behind a particular religious belief.” Engel, 370 U.S. at 431. One is suffered by the\n\nindividual. “A state-created orthodoxy puts at grave risk that freedom of belief and\n\nconscience which are the sole assurance that religious faith is real, not imposed.” Lee,\n\n505 U.S. at 592; see Engel, 370 U.S. at 429 (“[O]ne of the greatest dangers to the\n\nfreedom of the individual to worship in his own way lay[s] in the Government’s placing\n\nits official stamp of approval upon one particular kind of prayer . . . .”). The second injury\n\nis to the government itself. A well-founded perception that a government favors citizens\n\nsubscribing to a particular faith would undermine the democratic legitimacy of its\n\nactions. See Engel, 370 U.S. at 431 (“[W]henever government had allied itself with one\n\nparticular form of religion, the inevitable result had been that it had incurred the hatred,\n\ndisrespect and even contempt of those who held contrary beliefs.”).\n\n       By proclaiming the spiritual and moral supremacy of Christianity, characterizing\n\nthe political community as a Christian one, and urging adherents of other religions to\n\nembrace Christianity as the sole path to salvation, the Board in its prayer practice stepped\n\nover the line. Concerns of this nature underlay Justice Jackson’s enduring distillation of\n\nFirst Amendment values: “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is\n\nthat no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,\n\nnationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion . . . .” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v.\n\n                                             33\n\fBarnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943). This is no less true when orthodoxy reflects, as it did\n\nhere, the most sincere manifestations of the most deeply held convictions.\n\n                                               C.\n\n       Before delivering their invocations, the commissioners told attendees to rise and\n\noften invited them to pray. See, e.g., S.A. 12 (prayer of November 19, 2007) (“Let’s pray\n\ntogether.”); S.A. 26 (prayer of October 4, 2010) (“Please pray with me.”); S.A. 37 (prayer\n\nof February 19, 2013) (“Let us pray.”). Through these requests and the proselytizing\n\ninvocations just discussed, the Board members “press[ed] religious observances upon\n\ntheir citizens.” Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 683.\n\n       Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion in Town of Greece advises courts to assess\n\nwhether the “principal audience” for the invocations is the lawmakers or the public. 134\n\nS. Ct. at 1825. An internally-focused prayer practice “accommodate[s] the spiritual needs\n\nof lawmakers,” id. at 1826, while an externally-oriented one attempts “to promote\n\nreligious observance among the public,” id. at 1825.\n\n       The invitations here fall “within the realm of soliciting, asking, requesting, or\n\ndirecting . . . of concern to the Town of Greece plurality.” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 728.\n\nThe lead dissent insists that the Rowan County “legislators themselves [were] the\n\nintended ‘congregation’ for legislative prayer.” Infra Lead Dissent at 87. But the record\n\nmakes clear that the commissioners were seeking audience involvement, not merely\n\naddressing fellow legislators. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine more probative evidence of\n\na government’s concern for the community’s religiosity than a legislator’s request that\n\ncitizens join him in prayers that, for instance, ask “the world [to] believe that [God] sent\n\n                                               34\n\fJesus to save us from our sins.” S.A. 21 (prayer of October 5, 2009). Because the\n\ninvocations here placed Christianity on a higher plane than other faiths and urged\n\nattendees to embrace that religion, the requests to participate in those prayers are clear\n\nindicators of an effort “to promote religious observance among the public.” Town of\n\nGreece, 134 S. Ct. at 1825 (plurality opinion).\n\n       Town of Greece involved similar requests, but the prayers in that case did not\n\napproach the degree of proselytization here and—even more important—the invitations\n\n“came not from town leaders but from the guest ministers, who presumably are\n\naccustomed to directing their congregations in this way.” Id. at 1826. Justice Kennedy\n\nunderscored that “[a]lthough board members themselves stood [or] bowed their heads,”\n\nthey “at no point solicited similar gestures by the public.” Id.\n\n       From the perspective of the reasonable observer, this distinction matters. Such an\n\nobserver is aware that phrases like “Let us pray” may be “for many clergy . . . almost\n\nreflexive.” Id. at 1832 (Alito, J., concurring). But when these words are uttered by elected\n\nrepresentatives acting in their official capacity, they become a request on behalf of the\n\nstate. The invitations suggest that the lawmaker conceives of the political community as\n\ncomprised of people who pray as he or she does.\n\n       The Town of Greece plurality expressly cautioned that “[t]he analysis would be\n\ndifferent if town board members directed the public to participate in the prayers.” Id. at\n\n1826 (emphasis added). Yet Rowan County would have us approve such requests\n\nregardless of their source. See Supp. Br. of Appellant at 7 (“The Supreme Court saw no\n\nconflict between these introductions and the Establishment Clause.”). Accepting this\n\n                                             35\n\fargument would require us to blind ourselves to the very fact that the Town of Greece\n\nplurality regarded as relevant and perhaps even dispositive. In the end, the record speaks\n\nfor itself: elected officials exhorted their constituents to participate in sectarian—and\n\nsometimes even proselytizing—religious exercises.\n\n                                             D.\n\n       Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion in Town of Greece instructs courts to consider\n\n“the setting in which the prayer arises.” 134 S. Ct. at 1825. The prayers here were\n\ndelivered at the public meetings of a local government body, a fact that makes the other\n\naspects of the county’s prayer practice even more questionable.\n\n       Relative to sessions of Congress and state legislatures, the intimate setting of a\n\nmunicipal board meeting presents a heightened potential for coercion. Local governments\n\npossess the power to directly influence both individual and community interests. As a\n\nresult, citizens attend meetings to petition for valuable rights and benefits, to advocate on\n\nbehalf of cherished causes, and to keep tabs on their elected representatives—in short, to\n\nparticipate in democracy. The decision to attend local government meetings may not be\n\nwholly voluntary in the same way as the choice to participate in other civic or community\n\nfunctions. Going to one’s seat of government and going to one’s place of worship are\n\n“very different forms of attendance.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 437 (panel dissent).\n\n       In addition, the commissioners considered citizen petitions shortly after the\n\ninvocation. Like other local governments, the Board exercises both legislative authority\n\nover questions of general public importance as well as a quasi-adjudicatory power over\n\nsuch granular issues as zoning petitions, permit applications, and contract awards. In\n\n                                             36\n\fTown of Greece, the board apparently bifurcated its meetings into legislative and\n\nadjudicative portions. See 134 S. Ct. at 1829 (Alito, J., concurring). As Justice Alito\n\nexplained in his concurrence, the prayer “preceded only the portion of the town board\n\nmeeting that [was] essentially legislative.” Id. Accordingly, the case did not “involve the\n\nconstitutionality of a prayer prior to what may be characterized as an adjudicatory\n\nproceeding.” Id.\n\n       In the parlance of Justice Alito’s concurrence, Rowan County’s Board\n\nintermingled its legislative and adjudicative business. On numerous occasions,\n\nadjudicatory proceedings were the first items up for consideration after the standard\n\nopening protocols. See, e.g., J.A. 27 (agenda of November 5, 2007) (“Quasi-Judicial\n\nPublic Hearing for PCUR 02-07 for Request by Nelson Lingle”); J.A. 105 (agenda of\n\nAugust 17, 2009) (“Quasi-Judicial Hearing for CUP 01-09 for Albert Ray Kepley”); J.A.\n\n163 (agenda of February 21, 2011) (“Quasi-Judicial Hearing for SUP 01-11”).\n\n       The “close proximity” between a board’s sectarian exercises and its consideration\n\nof specific individual petitions “presents, to say the least, the opportunity for abuse.”\n\nLund, 837 F.3d at 436 (panel dissent). The plurality in Town of Greece recognized as\n\nmuch in advising courts to consider whether “town board members directed the public to\n\nparticipate in the prayers.” 134 S. Ct. at 1826. This is not to suggest that the\n\ncommissioners made decisions based on whether an attendee participated in the prayers.\n\nBut the fact remains that the Board considered individual petitions on the heels of the\n\ncommissioners’ prayers.\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\f       Finally, the intimacy of a town board meeting may push attendees to participate in\n\nthe prayer practice in order to avoid the community’s disapproval. This is especially true\n\nwhere, as here, the government has aligned itself with the faith that dominates the\n\nelectorate. Rowan County’s commissioners always stood up and bowed their heads, as\n\ndid most of the audience. Due to the Board’s requests, the plaintiffs also felt compelled to\n\nstand so that they would not stand out. And as we noted, one person who spoke out\n\nagainst the Board’s prayer practice was booed and jeered by her fellow citizens.\n\n       To be sure, citizens could time their arrival at the meeting to come after the prayer,\n\nleave the room before the prayer, or simply stay seated. But these options, such as they\n\nwere, served only to marginalize. It is simply wrong to attribute discomfort with the\n\nsituation here to hyper-sensitivity. Plaintiffs were placed in a situation that required them\n\nto decide “between staying seated and unobservant, or acquiescing to the prayer\n\npractice.” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 732. What was forced upon plaintiffs at these\n\nmeetings was “no trivial choice, involving, as it does, the pressures of civic life and the\n\nintimate precincts of the spirit.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 437 (panel dissent).\n\n       There remains the question of what prayer practice in Rowan County would be a\n\npermissible one. We decline, however, to select one from among the various options\n\navailable to defendant. Any future course of action is, and certainly would be in the first\n\ninstance, for Rowan County to decide. The problematic features of the present practice\n\nnoted in our decision should provide substantial guidance for whatever future steps the\n\ncounty may wish to take. The ultimate criterion is simply one of conveying a message of\n\nrespect and welcome for persons of all beliefs and adopting a prayer practice that\n\n                                             38\n\fadvances “the core idea behind legislative prayer, ‘that people of many faiths may be\n\nunited in a community of tolerance and devotion.’” Id. at 438 (quoting Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1823).\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       We finally find unavailing the two primary arguments advanced in Rowan\n\nCounty’s favor. To begin, the county urges this court to conduct a blinkered review of its\n\nprayer practice. The county first reduces the practice to its constituent elements, then\n\nfinds that each element is not dispositive, and finally concludes that each element is\n\ntherefore immaterial. See, e.g., Supp. Br. of Appellant at 9 (“[F]our rights do not make a\n\nwrong. . . . [E]ach feature enumerated by plaintiffs is common to prayer practices\n\nobserved in [other] legislatures . . . .”).\n\n       But when a court looks to the totality of the circumstances to assess the\n\nconstitutionality of a prayer practice, as the Supreme Court says we must, a fact may be\n\nrelevant to the court’s inquiry while not outcome-determinative. And by dissecting the\n\nprayer practice and subjecting each piece to an independent constitutional evaluation, the\n\ncounty’s approach overlooks the crucial interaction between the elements. This mode of\n\nanalysis simply fails to heed the Supreme Court’s instruction that we examine “the prayer\n\nopportunity as a whole.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824.\n\n       The dissents do not even begin to consider the prayer practice here holistically.\n\nThey address it piece by piece by piece. Unsurprisingly, they find each piece “standing\n\nalone [is] undoubtedly constitutional.” Infra Lead Dissent at 76. Be that as it may, the\n\ncitizens of Rowan County are not experiencing the prayer practice piece by piece by\n\n                                              39\n\fpiece. It comes at them whole. It would seem elementary that a thing may be innocuous\n\nin isolation and impermissible in combination. In fact, the lead dissent’s tired “divide and\n\nconquer” strategy has been frowned upon by the Supreme Court itself. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 274 (2002) (“The court's evaluation and rejection of seven\n\nof the listed factors in isolation from each other does not take into account the ‘totality of\n\nthe circumstances,’ as our cases have understood that phrase. . . . [Precedent] precludes\n\nthis sort of divide-and-conquer analysis.”).\n\n       Second, we cannot discern any meaningful distinction between the commissioners\n\nand the Board. The lead dissent argues that “[t]here is no evidence that the Board, as a\n\nBoard, had any role in any of the prayers given by any of the individual commissioners,”\n\nwho are “free agent[s] no different from the ministers in Town of Greece or the paid\n\nchaplain in Marsh.” Infra Lead Dissent at 88. On this view, “it is only through [the] act of\n\nthe deliberative body writing or editing religious speech that government would\n\nimpermissibly seek ‘to promote a preferred system of belief or code of moral behavior’\n\nwith selected content.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 421. (quoting Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n1822). This reasoning proves too much. Such an approach would create a constitutional\n\nsafe harbor for all prayers delivered by legislators “no matter how proselytizing,\n\ndisparaging of other faiths, or coercive” so long as the legislature itself did not\n\ncollectively compose the prayers. Supp. Br. of Appellees at 13-14 n.5.\n\n       Further, the attempted distinction between the members of the Board and the\n\nBoard itself rests on a formalism that cannot withstand scrutiny. When one of Rowan\n\nCounty’s commissioners leads his constituents in prayer, he is not just another private\n\n                                               40\n\fcitizen. He is the representative of the state, and he gives the invocation in his official\n\ncapacity as a commissioner. His power to offer a prayer derives from this status; were he\n\nnot a member of the Board, he would be barred from doing so. The commissioners\n\nthemselves recognized as much. Invoking a recurrent theme in the prayer practice, one\n\nBoard member observed: “[W]e’re not here representing ourselves. Lord, we represent\n\nyou and we represent the taxpayers of Rowan County.” S.A. 16 (prayer of October 6,\n\n2008). And unlike a guest minister, the commissioner remains on the scene to participate\n\nin the Board’s decision-making. Finally, “it is hard to believe that a practice observed so\n\nuniformly over so many years was not by any practical yardstick reflective of board\n\npolicy.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 434 (panel dissent). In the context of Rowan County’s prayer\n\npractice, there is no daylight between the individual commissioners and the Board of\n\nCommissioners.\n\n                                            V.\n\n       The principle at stake here may be a profound one, but it is also simple. The\n\nEstablishment Clause does not permit a seat of government to wrap itself in a single faith.\n\nBut here elected officials took up a ministerial function and led the political community\n\nin prayers that communicated exclusivity, leaving members of minority faiths unwilling\n\nparticipants or discomforted observers to the sectarian exercises of a religion to which\n\nthey did not subscribe. The solemn invocation of a single faith in so many meetings over\n\nso many years distanced adherents of other faiths from that representative government\n\nwhich affects the lives of all citizens and which Americans of every spiritual persuasion\n\nhave every right to call their own.\n\n                                            41\n\f       If the prayer practice here were to pass constitutional muster, we would be hard-\n\npressed to identify any constitutional limitations on legislative prayer. In arguing that the\n\nEstablishment Clause would still retain vitality, the lead dissent writes that the Board\n\nmembers would still not be permitted to offer “prayers that implored the audience to\n\nattend a particular church” or to issue “official decisions based on whether a member of\n\nthe public participated in, or voiced opposition to, the legislative prayer practice.” Infra\n\nLead Dissent at 98-99. Well of course such things would be wholly out of bounds. In\n\nsetting such criteria however, the dissent unwittingly reveals it recognizes few realistic\n\nlimits on public sectarian practice at all.\n\n       We recognize that dissents by their nature attempt to broaden majority opinions\n\nand portray them as doomsday propositions. But these dissents go well beyond even that.\n\nThe lead dissent writes that the majority restricts all lawmakers to “only a generic prayer\n\nto a generic god.” Infra Lead Dissent at 108. That assertion is incorrect. Any reading of\n\nthe majority opinion reveals it as a straw man. This case involves one specific practice in\n\none specific setting with one specific history and one specific confluence of\n\ncircumstances. To extract global significance from such specificity is beyond a stretch.\n\n       In concluding that Rowan County’s prayer practice is constitutionally infirm, we\n\nreiterate that legislator-led prayer can operate meaningfully within constitutional bounds.\n\nAnd “[n]othing about the constitutional drawbacks of Rowan County’s prayer practice\n\nshould be construed as disparaging the prayers themselves, which were moving and\n\nbeautiful on many levels.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 436 (panel dissent). But ruling in the\n\ncounty’s favor would send us down a rancorous road. It would bear “unfortunate\n\n                                              42\n\fconsequences for American pluralism, for a nation whose very penny envisions one out\n\nof many, a nation whose surpassing orthodoxy belongs in its constitutional respect for all\n\nbeliefs and faiths, a nation which enshrined in the First and Fourteenth Amendments the\n\nconviction that diversity in all of its dimensions is our abiding strength.” Id. at 432.\n\n       A final word as to our two friends and valued colleagues in dissent. Judge\n\nNiemeyer’s dissent seeks to characterize the majority opinion as anti-religious. See infra\n\nNiemeyer Dissent at 54 (“[T]he majority opinion’s reasoning strikes at the very trunk of\n\nreligion. . . .”); id. at 55 (“The majority’s most basic error is its underlying assumption\n\nthat the Establishment Clause is an anti-religion clause. . . .”). This suggestion may be\n\neasily dismissed. To reject the establishment of a single religious faith by the state is not\n\nto reject religion itself. See Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 435 (1962) (“It is neither\n\nsacrilegious nor antireligious to say that each separate government in this country should\n\nstay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers and leave that purely\n\nreligious function to the people themselves and to those the people choose to look to for\n\nreligious guidance.”). The Founders were able to distinguish between the importance of\n\nreligion (the Free Exercise Clause) and the establishment of religion in a way that Judge\n\nNiemeyer refuses to do. 4\n\n       The lead dissent, meanwhile, disparages the majority for its belief in an\n\n“ecumenical utopia” and its respect for the pluralistic nature of religious faith in our\n\n\n       4\n         We do note that our colleague has flatly mischaracterized the majority opinion.\nNowhere does it say or hold that “Rowan County’s prayer practice [is] unconstitutional,\nessentially because the prayers were sectarian.” Infra Niemeyer Dissent at 54.\n\n                                              43\n\fcountry. See infra Lead Dissent at 97. If that be our sin, we shall gladly confess it.\n\nLocalities enjoy wide discretion in designing a prayer practice, but those that do aspire to\n\nan ecumenical and pluralistic prayer opportunity should not have to suffer the scarcely\n\nconcealed aspersions of “ecumenical utopias” and “generic gods” that some may cast\n\nupon them. In its eager acceptance of state-entwined religious orthodoxy, the lead dissent\n\nevokes an America that is not ours and never has been. It was in simple recognition of\n\nreligious pluralism that the Founders adopted the Establishment Clause. See James\n\nMadison, Speech at the Virginia Ratifying Convention (June 12, 1788), in 11 The Papers\n\nof James Madison 130 (Robert Rutland et al. eds., 1977) (“[The] freedom [of religion]\n\narises from that multiplicity of sects, which pervades America, and which is the best and\n\nonly security for religious liberty in any society.”). Had America been a monolithic\n\nreligious entity, there would have been no need for the protection of religious diversity at\n\nall. Any thought that ecumenism and respect for religious pluralism would become\n\ndisfavored in judicial quarters would have left the Founders saddened at what their First\n\nAmendment had become.\n\n       Our Constitution seeks to preserve religious liberty without courting religious\n\nanimosity. In this quest, our two religion clauses have been a great success, helping to\n\nspare Americans the depth of religious strife that so many societies have had to suffer and\n\nendure. And yet free religious exercise can only remain free if not influenced and\n\ndirected by the hand of the state. On this score, the county simply went too far. The First\n\nAmendment in the end is not either/or, but both/and. Believing that free religious exercise\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\fin Rowan County may likewise further the values of religious welcome and inclusion, we\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                                                          AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                             45\n\fDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n          I concur in full with the majority opinion. I write separately to emphasize that our\n\ndecision today fully comports with Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983), Town of\n\nGreece v. Galloway, 134 S. Ct. 1811 (2014), and the history of the Establishment Clause\n\nitself.\n\n\n\n                                               I.\n\n          The Constitution forbids a legislative body from using its prayer opportunity to\n\nadvance one religion or set of religious beliefs to the exclusion of others. See Town of\n\nGreece, 134 S. Ct. at 1823; Marsh, 463 U.S. at 794–95. This rule derives from “[t]he\n\nclearest command of the Establishment Clause,” namely, “that one religious\n\ndenomination cannot be officially preferred over another.” Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S.\n\n228, 244 (1982). The most obvious way to show a preference for one religion is publicly\n\nto profess faith in its teachings. The Constitution fiercely protects this type of expression\n\nby individual citizens. But for the government, the Constitution absolutely forbids it.\n\nSee, e.g., Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 103–04 (1968).\n\n          This remains the law, and neither Marsh nor Town of Greece exempts prayer made\n\nbefore a legislative body from this rule. Rather, those cases simply hold that a legislative\n\nbody may participate in some limited forms of religious activity without officially taking\n\nsides or appearing to do so.\n\n          In Marsh, the Supreme Court concluded that the Nebraska Legislature did not\n\nabandon official neutrality by employing a chaplain of one particular religious\n\n                                               46\n\fdenomination to invoke divine guidance before a legislative session. See 463 U.S. at\n\n793–95. In so holding, the Court rightly deferred to the Framers’ judgment about this\n\ntype of government involvement with religion. See id. at 790–91. However, the Marsh\n\nCourt plainly did not abandon or make an exception to the Establishment Clause’s basic\n\ncommitment to neutrality.        Instead, the Court ultimately approved the Legislature’s\n\npractice because it found “no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to\n\nproselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.” Id. at 794–95.\n\n       In Town of Greece, the Court held that a legislative body’s chaplain-led prayer\n\ncould include sectarian content. 134 S. Ct. at 1823. Thus, the town board in that case did\n\nnot impermissibly prefer one religion over another simply because volunteer chaplains\n\nspoke in a particular religious idiom. To hold otherwise, the Court reasoned, would\n\nrequire legislatures and courts to “act as supervisors and censors of religious speech,”\n\nwhich would entangle government with religion far more than a rule allowing a prayer-\n\ngiver to draw on his private religious beliefs. Id. at 1822. Reviewing the town’s practice\n\nas a whole, the Court concluded that no other features of the town’s rotating system of\n\nvolunteer chaplains, all recruited in a non-discriminatory manner from local\n\ncongregations, advanced one religion to the exclusion of others. See id. at 1824.\n\n       Thus, Marsh and Town of Greece provide a guidepost for resolving the case at\n\nhand. If the Board’s practice sends the message that it prefers or accepts the teachings of\n\none religion over others, it violates the Constitution. If the practice simply allows a\n\nprayer-giver to espouse his own private religious beliefs when helping to solemnize the\n\nBoard’s meetings, it does not.\n\n                                             47\n\f       Of course, resolving whether a given practice violates the Establishment Clause\n\nrequires us to engage in a sensitive “interpretation of social facts.” Santa Fe Indep. Sch.\n\nDist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290, 315 (2000) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 694\n\n(1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). Yet some clear boundaries exist. For example,\n\nneither Marsh, nor Town of Greece, nor any other case suggests that a legislative body\n\nmay begin each and every one of its meetings by reciting a particular religion’s creed. It\n\ndoes not matter whether that creed is the Shahada of Islam, the Triple Gem of Buddhism,\n\na recitation from the Vedas or other shruti sacred to Hinduism, the Wiccan Rede, the\n\nShema Yisrael of Judaism — or the Apostle’s Creed of Christianity.\n\n       If members of a legislative body recited one religion’s creed month after month,\n\nyear after year, allowing no opportunity for members of any other religion to lead a\n\nprayer, a reasonable observer could only conclude that the legislative body preferred that\n\nreligion over all others. See Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 430 (1962) (“There can be no\n\ndoubt that New York’s state prayer program officially establishes the religious beliefs\n\nembodied in the Regents’ prayer,” even though the prayers were optional for students.).\n\nIf a practice like this does not violate the Establishment Clause, nothing would prevent\n\nthat legislature from passing a statute, ordinance, or resolution declaring a particular faith\n\nthe true religion.     No principled distinction exists between a legislative body’s\n\nproclaiming, for example, Christianity’s status as the one true religion in a written\n\ninstrument and professing that it is so — over and over again with no room for an\n\nalternative viewpoint — during public meetings. Both constitute state action. See Turner\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\fv. City Council of Fredericksburg, 534 F.3d 352, 354–55 (4th Cir. 2008) (O’Connor, J.).\n\nAnd both convey the message of government preference for one religion over all others.\n\n       In this case, for all the reasons set forth in the majority opinion, the Board’s\n\npractice sends the same message as the Apostle’s Creed. The undisputed record evidence\n\nrenders untenable Rowan County’s contention that the Commissioners were simply\n\nespousing their own personal religious beliefs. In over five years, the Board made no\n\ndisclaimers and adopted no official policies to that effect.      Moreover, the prayers\n\nthemselves were typically phrased using first-person plural pronouns like “we” and\n\n“our,” undermining any suggestion that the prayers were simply personal petitions. Nor\n\nis the conclusion Rowan County would have us draw apparent from the overall context of\n\nthe prayers. In sum, nothing about the Board’s practice would lead a reasonable observer\n\nto conclude that the Commissioners spoke only as individuals, rather than speaking for\n\nthe legislative body representing the people of Rowan County. Cf. Joyner v. Forsyth\n\nCty., 653 F.3d 341, 344 (4th Cir. 2011) (noting the board’s formal written policy that its\n\nprayers were “not intended . . . to affiliate the Board with, nor express the Board’s\n\npreference for, any faith or religious denomination”).\n\n       Given the Commissioners’ role in the prayer practice, the exclusivity of those\n\nprayers, the uniformity of the Christian message found in nearly every prayer, the\n\nfrequency of these sectarian prayers, the degree of sectarian content in the prayers, the\n\nlong duration of the prayer practice, and the reactions to the objections of non-Christian\n\nresidents, a reasonable observer would conclude that the Board had placed its imprimatur\n\non Christianity. In fact, a reasonable observer could not conclude otherwise.\n\n                                            49\n\f                                            II.\n\n       Nor can the historical practice of the First Congress save the Board’s practice. Of\n\ncourse, to the extent we can discern it, the Framers’ understanding of what constitutes\n\npermissible religious activity by the government serves as highly probative evidence of\n\nwhat the Establishment Clause allows and what it forbids. See Marsh, 463 U.S. at 790–\n\n91. Courts consider the Framers’ understanding probative because they drafted the First\n\nAmendment and sent it on to the states for ratification. As such, it is unlikely that the\n\nEstablishment Clause forbids a practice the First Congress engaged in or permits a\n\npractice it eschewed. For this very reason, the Marsh Court found it significant that the\n\nFirst Congress employed chaplains to deliver opening prayers, explaining that “[i]t can\n\nhardly be thought” the Framers “intended the Establishment Clause of the Amendment to\n\nforbid what they had just declared acceptable.” Id. at 790.\n\n       Study of the practice of the First Congress thus serves as a useful interpretive tool\n\nin legislative prayer cases, but this tool can easily be misused. One way to misuse it is to\n\nclaim that a practice dating back to the First Congress justifies a significantly different\n\nmodern practice. That is precisely what Rowan County and its supporting amici attempt\n\nto do here. They shoehorn the legislator-led prayer at issue in this case into the tradition\n\nbegun by the First Congress. But examination of the practice of the First Congress shows\n\nthat it provides no support at all for the Board’s prayer practice. Rowan County and its\n\nsupporting amici do not cite a single authority suggesting that the First Congress engaged\n\nin a practice similar to the one at issue — that is, having one of its own members deliver\n\n                                            50\n\fthe opening prayer. Perhaps most notably, my dissenting colleagues cannot cite any such\n\nauthority either.\n\n       This stands to reason. A search of the Journals of House and Senate from 1789 to\n\n1791, the official contemporaneous records of the proceedings in the First Congress, and\n\nthe Annals of Congress, which were compiled later from the best available sources from\n\nthat time period, does not yield even one example of legislator-led prayer during the First\n\nCongress. The Framers apparently relied exclusively on chaplain-led prayer to solemnize\n\ntheir proceedings.    Of course, this does not establish that legislator-led prayer is\n\nunconstitutional, but it does preclude any argument that legislator-led prayer must be\n\nconstitutional because the First Congress approved of it.\n\n       Rather than cite historical evidence that is truly probative of the meaning of the\n\nEstablishment Clause, the principal dissent relies on recent instances of legislator-led\n\nprayer in Congress, none of which occurred before 1973; the contemporary practices of\n\nstate and local legislatures; the practice of the South Carolina Provincial Congress; and a\n\nvague, citation-free statement from the late Senator Robert C. Byrd that senators have\n\ngiven the opening prayer “from time to time.” See 2 Robert C. Byrd, The Senate 1789 –\n\n1989: Addresses on the History of the United States Senate 305 & 647 n.17 (Wendy\n\nWolff ed., 1991) (citing two resolutions as support for a different proposition). In the\n\nhistorical analysis endorsed by the Marsh Court, this is very thin gruel. And it is\n\ncertainly no substitute for the Framers’ own practice and understandings.\n\n       Furthermore, the limits the Framers imposed on their own practice of chaplain-led\n\nprayer provide significant evidence of what they believed to be the dividing line between\n\n                                            51\n\fpermissible and impermissible legislative prayer. By the standards of an overwhelmingly\n\nProtestant society, the First Congress took pains to ensure that its own legislative prayer\n\npractice remained religiously neutral, both in appearance and in practice. As one of its\n\nvery first orders of business, the House and Senate formed committees “to take under\n\nconsideration the manner of electing Chaplains.” S. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 10\n\n(1789).    On April 15, 1789, the Senate committee reported back with a proposed\n\nresolution:\n\n       That two Chaplains, of different denominations, be appointed to Congress,\n       for the present session, the Senate to appoint one, and give notice thereof to\n       the House of Representatives, who shall, thereupon, appoint the other;\n       which Chaplains shall commence their services in the Houses that appoint\n       them, but shall interchange weekly.\n\nId. at 12 (emphases added); see also Marsh, 463 U.S. at 793 n.13. The Senate adopted\n\nthe resolution, S. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1789), and the House concurred two\n\ndays later, H.R. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1789). The Senate went on to elect\n\nSamuel Provoost, an Episcopalian bishop, as its first chaplain, and the House in turn\n\nelected William Linn, a Presbyterian minister. S. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1789);\n\nH.R. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 26 (1789). *\n\n       This history surely reflects the Framers’ concern with avoiding even a suggestion\n\nthat Congress subscribed to the tenets of a single religion. I can discern no other reason\n\n       *\n         This rule stood without interruption for the next sixty-one years. Along the way,\nCongress rejected proposals that would have omitted or specifically struck the “of\ndifferent denominations” language in 1800, 1810, 1845, 1846, and 1847. S. Journal, 6th\nCong., 2d Sess. 109 (1800); S. Journal, 11th Cong., 3d Sess. 526 (1810); H.R. Journal,\n11th Cong., 3d Sess. 441 (1810); H.R. Journal, 29th Cong., 1st Sess. 72 (1845); H.R.\nJournal, 29th Cong., 2d Sess. 52 (1846); H.R. Journal, 30th Cong., 1st Sess. 59 (1847).\n\n                                             52\n\fwhy the House and Senate would have bound themselves to select chaplains of different\n\ndenominations and to rotate their chaplains so often.      The Framers understood that\n\nlegislative prayer, even when led exclusively by chaplains, can be just as dangerous as\n\nother forms of government-sponsored religious activity unless measures are taken to\n\navoid a sectarian preference, or even the appearance of one.\n\n      The Board’s practice in the case at hand simply does not fit the tradition of\n\nlegislative prayer the First Congress began.      In the aggregate, the Board’s practice\n\namounts to an advancement of the tenets of a preferred religion. The members of the\n\nFirst Congress, who were far less acquainted with religious diversity than we are today,\n\nmanaged to avoid this, and they fashioned their own prayer practice to do so. Surely,\n\nRowan County can do the same.\n\n\n\n                                           III.\n\n      The Supreme Court has not disavowed the fundamental rule that a legislative body\n\nmay not use its prayer opportunity to promote or affiliate itself with one religion to the\n\nexclusion of others. If the Board’s practice does not violate this rule, then I cannot\n\nimagine what does.\n\n      Judge Keenan and Judge Harris have authorized me to indicate that they join in\n\nthis concurring opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                           53\n\fNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, with whom Judge SHEDD joins, dissenting:\n\n        I am pleased to concur in Judge Agee’s fine opinion, which carefully and\n\nfaithfully applies the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Town of Greece v. Galloway,\n\n134 S. Ct. 1811 (2014). I write separately to focus on how the majority opinion, beyond\n\nsimply sidestepping Town of Greece, actively undermines the appropriate role of prayer\n\nin American civic life. While it pays lip service to controlling law, it nonetheless seeks to\n\navoid it and to reinstate instead the holding in Joyner v. Forsyth County, 653 F.3d 341\n\n(4th Cir. 2011), which was squarely overturned by Town of Greece.\n\n\n                                              I\n\n        In finding Rowan County’s prayer practice unconstitutional, essentially because\n\nthe prayers were sectarian, the majority opinion’s reasoning strikes at the very trunk of\n\nreligion, seeking to outlaw most prayer given in governmental assemblies, even though\n\nsuch prayer has always been an important part of the fabric of our democracy and civic\n\nlife.\n\n        The history of prayer practice in governmental assemblies is well documented\n\nboth by the Supreme Court in its decisions in Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983),\n\nand Town of Greece and by the amicus brief submitted in this case by several States,\n\nwhich demonstrates that the practice is an important reflection of the values underlying\n\nboth the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. By ignoring\n\nthese values, the majority is able to mischaracterize and thus misapply those\n\nconstitutional provisions.\n\n\n                                             54\n\f       The majority’s most basic error is its underlying assumption that the\n\nEstablishment Clause is an anti-religion clause that exists in tension with the Free\n\nExercise Clause. This, however, misunderstands the Establishment Clause’s role. In his\n\nseminal book on the subject, Philip Hamburger details how the Establishment Clause was\n\nactually included in the Constitution to enhance the free exercise of religion by\n\nprohibiting establishments that favored one religion to the detriment of others:\n\n       These established churches (Episcopal in the southern states and\n       Congregationalist in most New England states) were established through\n       state laws that, most notably, gave government salaries to ministers on\n       account of their religion. Whereas the religious liberty demanded by most\n       dissenters was a freedom from the laws that created these establishments,\n       the separation of church and state was an old, anticlerical, and, increasingly,\n       antiecclesiastical conception of the relationship between church and state.\n       As might be expected, therefore, separation was not something desired by\n       most religious dissenters or guaranteed by the First Amendment. Indeed, it\n       was quite distinct from the religious liberty protected in any clause of an\n       American constitution, whether that of the federal government or that of\n       any state.\n\n                                          * * *\n\n       The religious dissenters who participated in the campaign against\n       establishments and whose claims seem to have affected the wording of the\n       constitutional guarantees against establishments made demands for a\n       religious liberty that limited civil government, especially civil legislation,\n       rather than for a religious liberty conceived as a separation of church and\n       state. Moreover, in attempting to prohibit the civil legislation that would\n       establish religion, they sought to preserve the power of government to\n       legislate on religion in other ways.\n\n\nPhilip Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 10, 107 (2002).\n\n       Hamburger thus details how the Establishment Clause was designed to enable the\n\npresence of religion in civic life without impairing the religious diversity central to the\n\n\n                                             55\n\fRepublic. This is a far different understanding than that assumed by the majority, in\n\nwhich the Establishment Clause is designed to erect barriers around public life through\n\nwhich expressions of faith are not allowed. The majority seems to understand religious\n\nfreedom as freedom from religion, not as the freedom to practice religion openly in all\n\naspects of American life.\n\n      The free exercise of religion, including prayer practice, as enhanced by the\n\nprohibition of establishments, has been recognized as profoundly important to the vitality\n\nof American democracy and liberty — an important aspect of the Founders’ genius. In\n\nhis magnum opus Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville observed about America\n\nin the 1830s:\n\n      [A] democratic and republican religion . . . contributed powerfully to the\n      establishment of a republic and a democracy in public affairs; and from the\n      beginning, politics and religion contracted an alliance which has never\n      been dissolved.\n\n1 Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America at 311 (Henry Reeve trans., Vintage\n\nBooks 1960) (emphasis added). Tocqueville explained the benefit of the relationship,\n\nobserving that “despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot. Religion is much\n\nmore necessary in the republic . . . than in the monarchy.” Id. at 318. The theoretical\n\nbasis underpinning this observation was that “religion sustains a successful struggle with\n\nthat spirit of individual independence which is her most dangerous opponent.” 2 id. at\n\n29.\n\n      And this deeply grounded balance of democracy, religion, and freedom is well\n\nrecognized in our jurisprudence, as eloquently and unambiguously related in Supreme\n\n\n                                           56\n\fCourt cases. For instance, in Marsh v. Chambers, when the Court evaluated the practice\n\nof legislative prayer, its analysis was rooted in the Founders’ recognition of the practice’s\n\nvalue. The Court observed, “The opening of sessions of legislative and other deliberative\n\npublic bodies with prayer is deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country.\n\nFrom colonial times through the founding of the Republic and ever since, the practice of\n\nlegislative prayer has coexisted with the principles of disestablishment and religious\n\nfreedom.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 786 (emphasis added). In light of this history, the Court\n\naccepted “the interpretation of the First Amendment draftsmen who saw no real threat to\n\nthe Establishment Clause arising from a practice of prayer.” Id. at 791. It concluded that\n\n“there can be no doubt that the practice of opening legislative sessions with prayer has\n\nbecome part of the fabric of our society.” Id. at 792 (emphasis added).\n\n       In Town of Greece, the Court echoed these sentiments, stressing the value of faith\n\nexpression in public life. As the Court recognized, “That the First Congress provided for\n\nthe appointment of chaplains only days after approving language for the First\n\nAmendment demonstrates that the Framers considered legislative prayer a benign\n\nacknowledgment of religion’s role in society.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819\n\n(emphasis added). The Court stated that any test under the Establishment Clause “must\n\nacknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical\n\nscrutiny of time and political change.” Id. After all, any “test that would sweep away\n\nwhat has so long been settled would create new controversy and begin anew the very\n\ndivisions along religious lines that the Establishment Clause seeks to prevent.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                             57\n\f       Simply put, there is no ambiguity in the historical role and importance of\n\nlegislative prayer in civic life. In both Marsh and Town of Greece, the Court was entirely\n\nclear about this.    And, in each case, the Court took pains to mention that the\n\nEstablishment Clause was intended to protect, rather than constrain, public expression of\n\nreligious faith.\n\n       The majority refuses to recognize the importance of religion — and of legislative\n\nprayer in particular — to democracy and American civic life. And its decision to “pay\n\nclose attention to the interplay between the various facets of the County’s prayer\n\npractice” to assess whether it is too sectarian, ante at 23, unwisely inserts government\n\ninto the role of regulating faith expression in precisely the way the Establishment Clause\n\nwas intended to forbid.      To be sure, prayer practice can be misused, rendering it\n\nunprotected, when it denigrates or interferes with the religious practice of others. But\n\nshort of those abuses, it ought not to be subject to the scrutiny and skepticism with which\n\nit is met by the majority. The proper respect for a practice so venerated and important to\n\nour democratic order does not include the niggling of civil courts assessing whether the\n\npractice “pointedly” invokes a particular name of the Divine to bless and solemnize the\n\ngovernmental proceeding. Ante at 4. In carrying out its self-assigned mission to police\n\nRowan County’s prayer practice, the majority turns its back on the historical role and\n\nvalues of religion and prayer, as well as the principles of Town of Greece, and recasts the\n\nlaw and facts to serve its mission.\n\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\f                                                II\n\n       In order to advance its theory of the Establishment Clause, the majority opinion\n\nbrushes past Town of Greece through an attempt to distinguish it. This effort relies on the\n\ndistinction that the case before us involves invocations given by the legislators, while\n\nTown of Greece involved prayers given by chaplains, and then concludes casually that\n\nthis difference takes this case “well outside the confines of Town of Greece.” Ante at 21.\n\nHaving found that handle, the majority then considers itself absolved of precedent and\n\nfree to launch its own freestanding analysis.\n\n       A closer look at the distinction of which the majority makes so much, however,\n\ndemonstrates that its analysis is nothing but a loosely disguised rationalization adopted to\n\nopen the way to its new approach. The fact that the prayer-giver in Rowan County was a\n\ncommissioner, not a minister designated or hired by the Board of Commissioners,\n\nresonates with nothing in Town of Greece, nor has anything outside of the majority\n\nopinion itself ever suggested that the status of the person giving an invocation is material\n\nto the constitutional analysis. Indeed, the Court has never specified which individuals are\n\nallowed to pray publicly. On the contrary, both Marsh and Town of Greece teach that the\n\npurpose of legislative prayer “is largely to accommodate the spiritual needs of\n\nlawmakers,” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1826. It is thus not surprising that the\n\nhistorical facts of the long-standing tradition of prayer practice at governmental\n\nassemblies show that prayer-givers can include governmental officials or members of the\n\nassembly. In the U.S. Congress, for example, prayers have been given not only by the\n\nhired Chaplain, but also by Members of Congress. Similarly, the amicus brief filed by\n\n                                            59\n\fthe States shows that a majority of state and territorial legislators rely on lawmaker-led\n\ninvocations. And they show the same is true for local governments, where the practice of\n\ngovernment officials giving the invocations is widespread.\n\n       The majority’s pro forma distinction of Town of Greece can only be driven by its\n\ndesire to reach a different end, because the nature of Rowan County’s prayer practice is,\n\nin all aspects of plaintiffs’ complaints, virtually indistinguishable from the practice\n\nupheld by the Supreme Court in Town of Greece. As Judge Agee shows in detail, Town\n\nof Greece upheld the prayer practice in the context of a small local political assembly, as\n\nis the case here; Town of Greece upheld prayers primarily invoking Jesus and other\n\nChristian elements, as is the case here; Town of Greece upheld the request to stand for\n\nprayer, as is the case here; and Town of Greece rejected the complaints about the prayers\n\nbeing “offensive, intolerable, and an affront to a diverse community,” 134 S. Ct. at 1817\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted), as made by the plaintiffs here. The Town of Greece\n\nCourt also rejected the argument, which the majority embraces here, that it was the\n\ntotality of these elements that offended the Establishment Clause.\n\n       To advance its mission under the banner of the Establishment Clause, the majority\n\nopinion also spins the facts to suggest that Rowan County is, through some unwritten\n\nagreement of its Commissioners, coercing its citizens to pray Christian prayers. It states\n\nthat the prayer practice was designed “to identify the government with Christianity”; that\n\nthe five Commissioners “maintained exclusive and complete control over the content of\n\nprayers”; that the Commissioners agreed on the prayer “featuring but a single faith”; and\n\nthat the prayer was “pointedly sectarian.” Ante at 4, 10, 20, 4 (emphasis added and\n\n                                            60\n\fcitations omitted). The record, however, simply does not support any such suggestion of\n\ncoercion, exclusion, or agreement.\n\n       Rather, under the practice of Rowan County, as set forth in the record, one of the\n\nfive Commissioners, in rotation, gives a brief invocation according to that\n\nCommissioner’s individual discretion,       without any prestanding instruction or\n\nunderstanding about the content or nature of the invocation. Each Commissioner has\n\naffirmed by affidavit that the nature and composition of the invocation — or indeed a\n\nmoment of silence — is left entirely to the discretion of the Commissioner and that there\n\nis no policy — written or unwritten — “regarding the form or content of any\n\ncommissioner’s Invocation.” And each has stated that the invocation is given “for the\n\nedification and benefit of the commissioners and to solemnize the meeting.” The fact\n\nthat the prayers were Christian in nature only reflected each prayer-giver’s religion, not\n\nsome design, policy, or agreement of the Commissioners.\n\n       Thus, evading the lessons of Town of Greece and armed with recharacterized facts,\n\nthe majority conducts its own analysis, based in large part on isolated quotations from the\n\nauthor’s own opinions, either in dissent or overruled, or from the very district court\n\nopinion it is reviewing in this case. This approach amounts simply to a barely disguised\n\ndisagreement with the Supreme Court’s support of sectarian legislative prayer in Town of\n\nGreece.\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\f                                            III\n\n       The reason behind the majority’s wayward approach is not a total mystery. Judge\n\nWilkinson, writing for the majority, and the ACLU, representing the plaintiffs, have acted\n\nwith harmonious parallelism, both having sought to circumvent the application of Town\n\nof Greece, and to return to the principles of Joyner v. Forsyth County, which Town of\n\nGreece overruled.\n\n       In February 2012, the ACLU complained to the Rowan County Commissioners\n\nabout the “practice of convening Board meetings with sectarian prayer, particularly\n\nChristian prayers,” (emphasis added), and, to support its position, quoted Judge\n\nWilkinson’s opinion in Joyner, which held that legislative prayer is appropriate “only\n\nwhen it is nonsectarian,” 653 F.3d at 345, and that, in order to embrace a nonsectarian\n\nideal, States and local governmental entities must be “proactive in discouraging sectarian\n\nprayer in public settings,” id. at 353 (emphasis added). Then, shortly after the decision in\n\nTown of Greece was handed down, the ACLU announced, “This morning, the Supreme\n\nCourt issued a disappointing and troubling decision upholding a town board’s practice of\n\nopening its meetings with Christian prayers.” Heather L. Weaver, Supreme Court Turns\n\nBlind Eye to Exclusionary Prayers at Government Meetings, ACLU (May 5, 2014, 2:57\n\nPM), https://perma.cc/2UGE-5TNL.\n\n       Similarly, in his dissent in this case from the panel’s application of Town of\n\nGreece to uphold Rowan County’s prayer practice, Judge Wilkinson lamented that the\n\nprayers in this case were “uniformly sectarian, referencing one and only one faith.” 837\n\nF.3d 407, 431 (4th Cir. 2013) (Wilkinson, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).              He\n\n                                            62\n\fcontinued, “I have seen nothing like it,” id., even though Town of Greece explicitly\n\nupheld uniformly sectarian prayer made in the tradition of only one faith.         In this\n\ndissenting opinion, Judge Wilkinson essentially sought to return to his own earlier\n\nopinion in Joyner, where he had held that opening a meeting with sectarian prayer\n\nviolated the Establishment Clause because the prayers “referred to Jesus, Jesus Christ,\n\nChrist, or Savior with overwhelming frequency.” Joyner, 653 F.3d at 349 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). His panel dissent thus concluded that, “[t]he desire of this fine\n\ncounty for prayer at the opening of its public sessions can be realized in non-\n\ndenominational prayer.” Lund, 837 F.3d. at 437 (Wilkinson, J., dissenting) (emphasis\n\nadded) (adopting the ACLU’s position that sectarian prayer was unconstitutional). But\n\nagain, these very conclusions were overruled in Town of Greece, which upheld uniformly\n\nsectarian prayer given at similar local governmental meetings.\n\n      The positions taken by the ACLU and Judge Wilkinson, while uncannily\n\nharmonious with each other, are starkly at odds with Town of Greece, relying on the very\n\narguments rejected by the Supreme Court in both Marsh and Town of Greece. In Marsh,\n\nthe Court rejected arguments based on the facts (1) that the legislative prayer was given\n\nby a clergyman of only one denomination for 16 years; (2) that public funds were used to\n\npay for the services of the prayer-giver; and (3) that the prayers were in a single faith\n\ntradition. And in Town of Greece, the Court rejected arguments based on the facts\n\n(1) that the prayers were given disproportionately by Christians; (2) that this disparity\n\neffectively sponsored sectarian prayers, given predominantly in the name of Jesus;\n\n(3) that the prayer givers began by asking the audience to stand and by saying, “Let us\n\n                                            63\n\fpray”; and (4) that the totality of the circumstances “conveyed the message that Greece\n\nwas endorsing Christianity.” 134 S. Ct. at 1818. Reading the majority opinion here in\n\nlight of Town of Greece, one could well believe that Justice Kagan’s dissent was in fact\n\ncontrolling.\n\n                                       *      *     *\n\n       At bottom, there simply is no constitutional defect in the prayer practice followed\n\nby Rowan County, and the majority’s effort to find it unconstitutional, despite Town of\n\nGreece, is, I respectfully suggest, aberrational.\n\n\n\n\n                                              64\n\fAGEE, Circuit Judge, with whom Judge Niemeyer, Judge Traxler, Judge Shedd, and\nJudge Diaz join, dissenting:\n\n       The majority holds that the Rowan County Board of Commissioners’ practice of\n\nopening its public meetings with a commissioner-led invocation violates the\n\nEstablishment Clause. That decision is irreconcilable with Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S.\n\n783 (1983), and Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 1811 (2014).\n\nTherefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n                                                I. 1\n\n       Rowan County, North Carolina, exercises its municipal power through an elected\n\nBoard of Commissioners (“the Board”), which typically holds public meetings twice a\n\nmonth. For many years, the Board has permitted each commissioner, on a rotating basis,\n\nto offer an invocation before the meetings. 2\n\n       Typically, the Board chair would call the meeting to order and invite the other\n\ncommissioners and public audience to stand for the ceremonial opening. A designated\n\ncommissioner would then offer an invocation of his or her choosing followed by the\n\nPledge of Allegiance. The content of each invocation was entirely in the discretion of the\n\nrespective commissioner; the Board neither composed the prayer nor policed its content.\n\nThe prayers frequently, though not invariably, invoked the Christian faith. For example,\n\n       1\n         At times, this opinion parallels language used in the now-withdrawn panel majority\nopinion. Lund v. Rowan Cty., 837 F.3d 407 (4th Cir. 2016), reh’g en banc granted, 670 F.\nApp’x 106 (4th Cir. 2016).\n       2\n         The record does not reflect that the Board adopted a written policy regarding the\ninvocations, but it followed a relatively routine practice.\n\n                                                65\n\fafter beginning the prayers with some variant of “let us pray” or “please pray with me,\n\nthe prayer givers often referred to “Jesus,” “Christ,” and “Lord.” E.g., Suppl. J.A. 36–\n\n37. 3   Although not required to do so, most of the public audience joined the\n\ncommissioners in standing for the invocation and the Pledge of Allegiance. Once this\n\nceremonial part of the meeting concluded, the Board turned to its public business.\n\n        Rowan County residents Nancy Lund, Liesa Montag–Siegel, and Robert Voelker\n\n(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle\n\nDistrict of North Carolina “to challenge the constitutionality of [the Board’s] practice of\n\ndelivering sectarian prayer at meetings.” J.A. 10. Plaintiffs alleged that the prayer\n\npractice unconstitutionally affiliated the Board with one particular faith and caused them\n\nto feel excluded as “outsiders.” J.A. 12. In addition, they alleged that the overall\n\natmosphere was coercive, requiring them to participate so they “would not stand out,”\n\nSuppl. J.A. 2, or otherwise be singled out in a manner they speculated might negatively\n\naffect business before the Board.\n\n        Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the Board’s prayer practice violated\n\nthe Establishment Clause, along with an injunction preventing any similar future prayers.\n\nPlaintiffs successfully obtained a preliminary injunction based on now-abrogated case\n\nlaw from this Court which had held that sectarian legislative prayer violated the\n\nEstablishment Clause. See Joyner v. Forsyth Cty., 653 F.3d 341, 348 (4th Cir. 2011)\n\n(explaining that our decisions “hewed to [the] approach[ of] approving legislative prayer\n\n        3\n         This opinion omits internal marks, alterations, citations, emphasis, and footnotes from\nquotations unless otherwise noted.\n\n                                              66\n\fonly when it is nonsectarian in both policy and practice”), abrogated by Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. 1811. The Supreme Court then issued its decision in Town of Greece, which\n\nheld that sectarian legislative prayer was constitutional. 134 S. Ct. at 1815, 1820, 1824.\n\n       In the wake of Town of Greece, the parties filed cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment. Although the district court granted the Plaintiffs’ motion, it first recognized\n\nthat Town of Greece “repudiated” and “dismantl[ed] the Fourth Circuit’s legislative\n\nprayer doctrine [that had] developed around the core understanding that the sectarian\n\nnature of legislative prayers was largely dispositive” of its constitutionality. Lund v.\n\nRowan Cty., 103 F. Supp. 3d 712, 719, 721 (M.D.N.C. 2015). Nonetheless, the district\n\ncourt concluded that “[s]everal significant differences” between Town of Greece and this\n\ncase—including the identity of the prayer givers and the invitation to the public to\n\nstand—rendered the Board’s practice unconstitutional. Id. at 724.\n\n\n\n                                            II.\n\n       As the majority acknowledges, this case requires a case-specific evaluation of all\n\nthe facts and circumstances. See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 678–79 (1984)\n\n(observing that the Establishment Clause cannot be applied mechanistically to draw\n\nunwavering, universal lines for the varying contexts of public life). Those facts and\n\ncircumstances must be viewed through the lens of the Supreme Court’s prior legislative\n\nprayer decisions, including both its broader explications of what legislative prayer\n\npractices are permissible and its narrower applications of those principles to the facts\n\n\n\n                                            67\n\fpresented in those cases. So, before turning to the facts and circumstances of this case,\n\nit’s important to review the first principles from Marsh and Town of Greece.\n\n       Though legislative prayer is government speech touching on religion, Turner v.\n\nCity Council of Fredericksburg, 534 F.3d 352, 354 (4th Cir. 2008), the Supreme Court\n\nhas not relied on traditional Establishment Clause analysis to assess its constitutionality.\n\nSee Marsh, 463 U.S. at 792. Legislative prayer is its own genre of Establishment Clause\n\njurisprudence, assessed under a different framework that takes the unique circumstances\n\nof its historical practice and acceptance into account. See Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n1818 (“Marsh is sometimes described as ‘carving out an exception’ to the Court’s\n\nEstablishment Clause jurisprudence, because it sustained legislative prayer without\n\nsubjecting the practice to any of the formal tests that have traditionally structured this\n\ninquiry.”).\n\n       The Supreme Court first articulated this approach in Marsh, which involved a\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of the Nebraska legislature’s practice of having a paid\n\nchaplain offer a prayer to open each legislative session. Recounting the long-standing\n\nAmerican tradition of opening legislative sessions with prayer, the Supreme Court traced\n\nthe history of legislative prayer “[f]rom colonial times through the founding of the\n\nRepublic and ever since.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 786.\n\n       The Court ascribed particular significance to the views of the First Congress,\n\nwhich, “as one of its early items of business, adopted the policy of selecting a chaplain to\n\nopen each session with prayer.” Id. at 787–88. The Senate and House, in turn, appointed\n\nofficial chaplains in 1789. Id. at 788. Placing great significance on these events, the\n\n                                            68\n\fCourt explained those acts reflected how legislative prayer fit into the Founders’\n\nunderstanding of the Establishment Clause: “It can hardly be thought that . . . they\n\nintended the Establishment Clause . . . to forbid what they had just declared acceptable.”\n\nId. at 790. “This unique history [led the Court] to accept the interpretation of the First\n\nAmendment draftsmen who saw no real threat to the Establishment Clause arising from\n\n[the] practice of [legislative] prayer[.]” Id. at 791.\n\n       Having upheld the constitutionality of legislative prayer in general, the Marsh\n\nCourt next considered whether Nebraska’s practice fell within the bounds of the First\n\nAmendment. In particular, the Court considered the plaintiff’s specific challenges to\n\nthree characteristics of Nebraska’s legislative prayer practice: (1) the State had selected a\n\nrepresentative of “only one denomination” for sixteen years; (2) the chaplain was a paid\n\nstate employee; and (3) his prayers were offered “in the Judeo–Christian tradition.” Id. at\n\n792–93.\n\n       The Court rejected each claim. First, the Court observed that the First Congress\n\n“did not consider opening prayers as a proselytizing activity or as symbolically placing\n\nthe government’s official seal of approval on one religious view.” Id. at 792. Next, it\n\nnoted that there was no evidence that the chaplain’s long tenure “stemmed from an\n\nimpermissible motive,” and thus his continuous appointment did “not in itself conflict\n\nwith the Establishment Clause.” Id. at 793–94. That the chaplain was paid from public\n\nfunds was similarly “grounded in historic practice” and thus not prohibited. Id. at 794.\n\nLastly, as for the content of the prayers, the Court explained it was “not of concern”\n\nbecause “there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to\n\n                                               69\n\fproselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.” Id. at 794–95.\n\nAccordingly, the Court declined “to parse the [prayer] content.” Id. at 795.\n\n       In County of Allegheny v. ACLU Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 578–\n\n79, 602 (1989), a case about the constitutionality of two religious holiday displays\n\nlocated on public property, the Court referred in dicta to its prior holding in Marsh,\n\nobserving that “[t]he legislative prayers involved in Marsh did not violate [the\n\nEstablishment Clause] because the particular chaplain had removed all references to\n\nChrist.” Id. at 603. In additional dicta, the Court observed that “not even the unique\n\nhistory of legislative prayer can justify contemporary legislative prayers that have the\n\neffect of affiliating the government with any one specific faith or belief.” Id.\n\n       Whatever fleeting persuasiveness that dicta merited, the Supreme Court\n\nunequivocally rejected it in Town of Greece. There, the Court explicitly disavowed any\n\nconstitutional requirement that legislative prayers be nonsectarian to comply with the\n\nEstablishment Clause: “An insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single,\n\nfixed standard is not consistent with the tradition of legislative prayer outlined in [our]\n\ncases.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1820.\n\n       The Town of Greece, New York, Board opened its monthly legislative meetings\n\nwith an invocation delivered by volunteer clergy. Guest chaplains were found by placing\n\ncalls to congregations listed in a local directory. Id. at 1816. Nearly all of these churches\n\nwere Christian, as were the guest clergy.         Most of the invocations referenced the\n\nChristian faith, but the Town Board was not aware of the prayer content beforehand, nor\n\ndid it attempt to edit the content of the prayer or otherwise instruct the prayer giver on\n\n                                             70\n\fwhat to say. Id. Though the Second Circuit concluded that this “steady drumbeat of\n\nChristian prayer . . . tended to affiliate the town with Christianity,” in violation of the\n\nEstablishment Clause, the Supreme Court disagreed. Id. at 1818.\n\n       The Supreme Court explained that Marsh instructed that the constitutionality of a\n\nlegislative prayer practice must be considered in light of “historical practices and\n\nunderstandings.” Id. at 1819; accord id. at 1818–19. A practice is constitutional so long\n\nas it “fits within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state legislatures”\n\nbecause “[a]ny test [we] adopt[ for analyzing invocations] must acknowledge a practice\n\nthat was accepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and\n\npolitical change.” Id.\n\n       The Court rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that legislative prayer must be to a\n\ngeneric god or otherwise nonsectarian to pass muster under the Establishment Clause by\n\nfocusing on three principles: the Framer’s understanding of legislative prayer, the\n\nhistorical place legislative prayer occupies in society, and avoiding official government\n\nentanglement in crafting the content of prayers. In addition, the Court recognized that\n\nlegislative prayer historically served a ceremonial function “at the opening of legislative\n\nsessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of\n\nthe Nation’s heritage.”     Id. at 1823.    Observing first that legislative invocations\n\ncontaining explicitly religious themes were accepted at the time of the First Congress and\n\nremained vibrant throughout American history to modern times, the Court concluded,\n\n“[a]n insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single, fixed standard is not\n\nconsistent with [our accepted] tradition of legislative prayer.” Id. at 1820. On this point,\n\n                                            71\n\fthe Court specifically disavowed Allegheny’s “nonsectarian” interpretation of Marsh as\n\ndictum “that was disputed when written and has been repudiated by later cases.” Id. at\n\n1821; see also id. (“Marsh nowhere suggested that the constitutionality of legislative\n\nprayer turns on the neutrality of its content.”).\n\n       The Court further observed that a content-based rule “would force the legislatures\n\nthat sponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases to act as\n\nsupervisors and censors of religious speech.” Id. at 1822. Enforcing specific content\n\nrestrictions would “involve government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is\n\nthe case under the town’s current practice of neither editing or approving prayers in\n\nadvance nor criticizing their content after the fact.” Id. “Once it invites prayer into the\n\npublic sphere,” the Court stated, “government must permit a prayer giver to address his or\n\nher own God or gods as conscience dictates, unfettered by what an administrator or judge\n\nconsiders to be nonsectarian.” Id. at 1822–23.\n\n       Synthesizing these factors, the Court fashioned three distinct, but related, holdings.\n\nFirst, the Court held that the years of prayers offered on behalf of the Town of Greece,\n\nalthough almost exclusively Christian, did not evince a pattern of denigration (of non-\n\nChristian faiths) or proselytization (to bolster Christianity).    Although some prayers\n\narguably contained proselytizing or disparaging content, the Court concluded that the\n\npractice as a whole served only to solemnize the board meetings. In other words, a few\n\nquestionable prayers were of no constitutional consequence. Id. at 1824.\n\n       Second, the Court determined to be of no moment the fact that the invited prayer\n\ngivers were predominantly Christian: “[s]o long as the town maintains a policy of\n\n                                              72\n\fnondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for\n\nnon-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing.” Id. Continuing,\n\nthe Court observed\n\n      [t]he quest to promote a diversity of religious views would require the town\n      to make wholly inappropriate judgments about the number of religions it\n      should sponsor and the relative frequency with which it should sponsor\n      each, a form of government entanglement with religion that is far more\n      troublesome than the current approach.\n\nId.\n\n      Third, the Court rebuffed the plaintiffs’ contention that the prayers\n\nunconstitutionally “coerce[] participation by nonadherents.” Id. (Kennedy, J., plurality\n\nopinion).   The Court acknowledged that “coercion” could render legislative prayer\n\nbeyond constitutional protection in some outlying circumstances, such as “[i]f the course\n\nand practice over time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbelievers or religious\n\nminorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion.” Id. at 1823 (majority opinion).\n\nAnd although Justices in the majority differed in their approaches, the Court nonetheless\n\nrejected the plaintiffs’ argument that coercion arose from either the context of a local\n\nmunicipal government meeting, or the prayer givers’ invitation that others could stand or\n\njoin in the prayer. Compare id. at 1824–28 (Sec. II.B of Justice Kennedy’s plurality\n\nopinion), with id. at 1837–38 (Sec. II of Justice Thomas’s concurring opinion).\n\n      Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, framed the\n\ncoercion inquiry as “a fact-sensitive one that considers both the setting in which the\n\nprayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed.” Id. at 1825 (plurality opinion).\n\nThese Justices found no coercion in Greece’s prayer practice, relying heavily on the\n\n                                           73\n\fhistorical approach of Marsh. They presumed that reasonable observers are aware of the\n\nmultiple traditions acknowledging God in this country, including legislative prayer, the\n\nPledge of Allegiance, and presidential prayers. They concluded that, because of these\n\ntraditions, citizens could appreciate the Town’s prayer practice without being compelled\n\nto participate. Id. Further, they observed that the prayers served a non-religious purpose:\n\nputting legislators in a contemplative state of mind and connecting them to the historical\n\ntradition of their forerunners. Id. at 1826. Justice Kennedy made clear that “[o]ffense . . .\n\ndoes not equate to coercion.” Id. He observed that “[a]dults often encounter speech they\n\nfind disagreeable,” even in a legislative forum, but that does not give rise to an\n\nEstablishment Clause violation. Id. Instead, the historical acceptance of legislative\n\nprayer recognizes that “citizens, firm in their own beliefs, can tolerate and perhaps\n\nappreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a person of a different faith.” Id. at 1823\n\n(majority opinion).\n\n       Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, interpreted the Establishment Clause to\n\nprohibit only “actual legal coercion,” which they defined as the exercise of “government\n\npower in order to exact financial support of the church, compel religious observance, or\n\ncontrol religious doctrine.” Id. at 1837 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in\n\nthe judgment).    As no evidence of actual legal coercion existed in this case, they\n\nconcurred in the Court’s judgment. Id. at 1837–38.\n\n       As this review of Marsh and Town of Greece confirms, our nation’s long historical\n\ntradition of welcoming and encouraging legislative prayer gives the practice a unique\n\nplace in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. It requires a different legal analysis than\n\n                                             74\n\fother types of government conduct touching on religion. The majority muddies the\n\ndistinct analysis required in this type of Establishment Clause case, relying on more\n\ngeneral principles applicable in other Establishment Clause contexts to avoid the clear\n\nlegal principles set out in Marsh and Town of Greece. 4 While lower court judges may\n\npersonally disagree with the principles the Supreme Court pronounces, they are not at\n\nliberty to ignore or dilute them. DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, 577 U.S. __, 136 S. Ct. 463,\n\n468 (2015) (reiterating that although “[l]ower court judges are certainly free to note their\n\ndisagreement with a decision of this Court,” they are nonetheless bound to follow those\n\ndecisions); United States v. Taylor, 754 F.3d 217, 223 (4th Cir. 2014) (Wilkinson, J.)\n\n(“[W]e shall follow the plain lessons of Supreme Court cases . . . , which must of\n\nnecessity govern our disposition of this case.”).\n\n\n\n                                               III.\n\n       The majority points to “the combination of [four] elements” that render the\n\nBoard’s prayer practice unconstitutional: (1) “commissioners as the sole prayer-givers”;\n\n(2) “invocations that drew exclusively on Christianity and sometimes served to advance\n\nthat faith”; (3) “invitations to attendees to participate”; and (4) “the local government\n\n\n       4\n          For example, the majority relies on Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962) (striking down\nstructured prayers in public schools), for several general principles regarding why government\nshould not become too affiliated with any religion. Majority Op. 33. These principles are valid\ninsofar as they go. But taken at face value, they would also lead to the conclusion that sectarian\nlegislative prayers violate the Establishment Clause. See McCreary Cty. v. ACLU, 545 U.S. 844,\n859 n.10 (2005) (citing Marsh as an example of a permissible governmental action whose\n“manifest purpose was presumably religious”). Because Marsh and Town of Greece demand\notherwise, their principles in this particular context must govern instead.\n\n                                               75\n\fsetting.” Majority Op. 22–23. But a proper application of the principles of Marsh and\n\nTown of Greece to the Board’s prayer practices leads to the opposite conclusion. Indeed,\n\nthe Supreme Court has already addressed three of the four factors the majority relies on,\n\nand has explained why they do not serve as a basis for an Establishment Clause violation.\n\nThe only new feature in this case is the identity of the prayer giver. But—for the reasons\n\nexplained below—that single characteristic does not remove the Board’s practice from\n\nthe protected scope of Marsh and Town of Greece. In short, the majority wrongly\n\nconcludes that the sum of the parts is greater than the whole—that is, that the four factors\n\nthey present, which standing alone are undoubtedly constitutional, somehow combine to\n\nrender the Board’s legislative prayer practice unconstitutional.\n\n       Curiously, the majority accuses the dissents of lacking “any sense of balance.”\n\nMajority Op. 18. Even more curiously, it suggests we fail to “consider the prayer\n\npractice. . . holistically.”   Majority Op. 39.   However, the majority’s invocation of\n\nbalancing factors and viewing otherwise valid principles “holistically” in order to reach a\n\npreferred result is no camouflage for its lack of merit. In short, the majority misapplies\n\nTown of Greece’s assessment of how the factors are to be evaluated both individually and\n\nin tandem.\n\n       As we’ve set out at great length, the only factor that distinguishes this case from\n\nMarsh or Town of Greece is that, here, an individual commissioner gives a prayer on a\n\nrotating basis. We conclude that factor does not skew the totality of the circumstances to\n\nmake Rowan County’s practice unconstitutional.        We then recount why the remaining\n\naspects of the County’s practice align with the practices previously approved of—in the\n\n                                            76\n\faggregate—in Marsh and Town of Greece. That is precisely the sort of analysis Marsh\n\nand Town of Greece require.\n\n                                             A.\n\n       Town of Greece instructs that the constitutionality of legislative prayer hinges on\n\nits historical roots. Because legislative prayer has been a constant and recognized part of\n\ncivic life for more than two centuries, it “has become part of the fabric of our society.”\n\nTown of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819. Hence, if a prayer practice has long been “followed\n\nin Congress and the state legislatures,” courts must view it as “a tolerable\n\nacknowledgement of beliefs widely held” by people in the United States. Id. at 1818–19;\n\nsee also id. at 1819 (observing that prayer practices “accepted by the Framers and [which\n\nhave] withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change” must not be “swe[pt]\n\naway” because doing so “would create new controversy and begin anew the very\n\ndivisions along religious lines that the Establishment Clause seeks to prevent”).\n\n       The majority gives this principle only a curt nod before decrying the Board’s\n\npractice of lawmaker-led legislative prayer as “unprecedented.” Majority Op. 15. That\n\nconclusion cannot withstand review.\n\n                                             1.\n\n       Straightaway—and without any legal support for doing so—the majority attaches\n\nnear-dispositive meaning to the fact that lawmakers, as opposed to clergy, gave the\n\nlegislative prayers at issue in this case.        While both Marsh and Town of Greece\n\nconsidered prayers given by clergy, the distinction between state-selected clergy prayer,\n\non the one hand, and lawmaker-led prayer, on the other, is a distinction without a\n\n                                             77\n\fdifference. Neither Marsh nor Town of Greece attached particular significance to the\n\nidentity of the speakers. Moreover, the tradition and history of lawmaker-led prayers is\n\nas prevalent as that of other legislative prayer givers. Thus, contrary to the majority’s\n\nsuggestion, the fact that the Supreme Court has not specifically addressed lawmaker-led\n\nprayer signifies nothing. Could it simply be that until recently, no one since 1788 had\n\nconceived that legislators leading legislative prayers for legislators was outside the\n\nhistorical tradition “followed in Congress and the state legislatures”? Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1819. Contra Majority Op. 17 (“The conspicuous absence of case law on\n\nlawmaker-led prayer is likely no accident.”). 5\n\n       The Supreme Court’s analysis of legislative prayer in Marsh and Town of Greece\n\ndid not look to the speakers’ identities; instead, the Court confined its discussion to the\n\ncircumstances of the prayer practices before it. See Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1820–\n\n28; Marsh, 463 U.S. at 786–95.          Nowhere did the Court say anything that could\n\nreasonably be construed as a requirement that outside or retained clergy are the only\n\nconstitutional source of legislative prayer.        Quite the opposite, Town of Greece\n\nspecifically directs courts’ focus to what has been done in “Congress and the state\n\nlegislatures” without limitation regarding the officiant. 134 S. Ct. at 1819. Far from\n\nsuggesting that this case falls outside the scope of Marsh or Town of Greece, the Supreme\n\n\n       5\n         Neither Marsh nor Town of Greece specifically put into issue lawmaker-led legislative\nprayers as their focus was the issue of legislative prayer as a whole. That said, the record in\nTown of Greece shows that on at least one occasion a councilman offered a prayer during the\nceremonial opening. See Joint Appendix, Town of Greece v. Galloway, 134 S. Ct. 1811 (2014)\n(No. 12–696), 2013 U.S. S. Ct. Briefs LEXIS 3132, at *62–63.\n\n                                              78\n\fCourt’s silence on the issue of lawmaker-led prayer is simply that: silence. See United\n\nStates v. Stewart, 650 F.2d 178, 180 (9th Cir. 1981) (remarking it would be improper to\n\ndraw any inference from the Supreme Court’s silence on an issue not placed before it).\n\n       Nor has this Court previously assigned weight to the identity of the prayer giver.\n\nTo the contrary, we have suggested that the speaker’s identity is irrelevant. For example,\n\nin Wynne v. Town of Great Falls, 376 F.3d 292 (4th Cir. 2004), we remarked that\n\n“[p]ublic officials’ brief invocations of the Almighty before engaging in public business\n\nhave always, as the Marsh Court so carefully explained, been part of our Nation’s\n\nhistory.” Id. at 302. Similarly, Joyner v. Forsyth County, 653 F.3d 341 (4th Cir. 2011),\n\nobserved that “[i]t [is] the governmental setting for the delivery of sectarian prayers that\n\ncourted constitutional difficulty, not those who actually gave the invocation.” Id. at 350;\n\nsee also id. at 351 (“Once again, the important factor was the nonsectarian nature of the\n\nprayer, not the identity of the particular speaker.”). And in Simpson v. Chesterfield\n\nCounty Board of Supervisors, 404 F.3d 276 (4th Cir. 2005), we noted that the Supreme\n\nCourt, “neither in Marsh nor in Allegheny, held that the identity of the prayer-giver,\n\nrather than the content of the prayer, was what would affiliate the government with any\n\none specific faith or belief.” Id. at 286. Although these cases ultimately turned on the\n\nnow-rejected position that sectarian prayer was constitutionally invalid, none made the\n\nprayer giver’s identity a factor in, let alone dispositive of, its analysis.\n\n       That conclusion makes sense given that legislative prayer constitutes a form of\n\ngovernment speech regardless of the identity of the speaker; otherwise, it would not\n\nimplicate the Establishment Clause at all. See, e.g., Snyder v. Murray City Corp., 159\n\n                                               79\n\fF.3d 1227, 1238 (10th Cir. 1998) (Lucero, J., concurring in the judgment) (recognizing\n\nthat “chaplains speak for the legislature”). Practically speaking, the public is unlikely to\n\ndraw any meaningful distinction between a state-paid chaplain (Marsh) or state-invited\n\ncleric (Town of Greece) and members of the legislative body that appoints him. These\n\ninvited officiants are in essence “deputized” to speak on behalf of the governing body.\n\nCf. Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1850 (Kagan, J., dissenting). Yet the practice was\n\nconstitutional, even when those officiants aligned with a particular religion and were paid\n\nwith state funds. Because a paid or invited officiant stands on the same footing as the\n\nlegislators, it follows that elected representatives may also be their own prayer givers.\n\nAnd when they take on that role, their religious preference in the ceremonial invocation is\n\nno different than the state-sponsored clergy in Marsh and Town of Greece. The Supreme\n\nCourt directly observed in Town of Greece that a purpose of legislative prayer was to\n\nallow legislators to “show who and what they are” through their prayers. Id. at 1826\n\n(plurality opinion).   It thus makes abundant common and constitutional sense that\n\nlegislators are ideally suited to offer meaningful, heartfelt prayer to the audience of those\n\nprayers: their fellow legislators. Id. at 1825.\n\n       On a broader level, the very “history and tradition” anchoring Town of Greece\n\nunderscores a long-standing national practice of legislative prayer generally and\n\nlawmaker-led prayer specifically. Opening invocations offered by elected legislators\n\nhave long been accepted as both a mainstay of civic life and a permissible form of\n\nreligious observance. See S. Rep. No. 32-376, at 4 (1853) (commenting that the authors\n\nof the Establishment Clause “did not intend to prohibit a just expression of religious\n\n                                              80\n\fdevotion by the legislators of the nation, even in their public character as legislators”\n\n(emphasis added)); see also Lynch, 465 U.S. at 674 (“There is an unbroken history of\n\nofficial acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in\n\nAmerican life from at least 1789.”). As just one example, the South Carolina Provincial\n\nCongress—South Carolina’s first independent legislature—routinely welcomed an\n\nelected member to deliver invocations. See, e.g., South Carolina Provincial Congress,\n\nThanks to the Continental Congress (Jan. 11, 1775), http://amarch.lib.niu.edu/islandora\n\n/object/niu-amarch%3A94077 (last visited May 23, 2017) (saved as ECF opinion\n\nattachment). These early public pronouncements are important evidence demonstrating\n\nthat lawmaker-led legislative prayer was viewed no differently from legislative prayer as\n\na whole. To conclude otherwise is to impugn the practical wisdom of the Framers—a\n\nfactor that weighed heavily in Town of Greece—and to suggest “the founders of the\n\nUnited States were unable to understand their own handiwork.” Myers v. Loudoun Cty.\n\nPub. Sch., 418 F.3d 395, 404 (4th Cir. 2005).\n\n      Equally troubling, the majority turns a blind eye to the prevalence of lawmaker-led\n\nlegislative prayer. A majority of states and territories honor requests from individual\n\nlegislators to give an opening invocation. See Nat’l Conference of State Legislatures,\n\nInside the Legislative Process 5–151 to –152 (2002), http://www.ncsl.org/documents\n\n/legismgt/ILP/02Tab5Pt7.pdf (observing legislators may offer an opening prayer in at\n\nleast thirty-one states). Lawmaker-led prayer is especially prevalent in the states under\n\nour jurisdiction, where seven of the ten legislative chambers utilize elected members for\n\nthis purpose. See id.; Br. of Amici Curiae State of West Virginia et al. Supporting Def.-\n\n                                           81\n\fAppellant at 14 & Add. 2–8; see also Office of Speaker Pro Tem Paul Stam, Prayers\n\nOffered     in   the     North   Carolina   House    of   Representatives:     2011–2014,\n\nhttp://nchousespeaker.com/docs/opening-prayers-nchouse-2011-2014.pdf         (last   visited\n\nMay 23, 2017).         Several of these states have enacted legislation recognizing and\n\nprotecting the historical practice of lawmaker-led prayer. For example, a Virginia statute\n\nprotects legislators who deliver a sectarian prayer during deliberative sessions. See Va.\n\nCode Ann. § 15.2-1416.1. And South Carolina expressly authorizes its elected officials\n\nto open meetings with prayer. See S.C. Code Ann. § 6-1-160(B)(1). Other states inside\n\nand outside our jurisdiction rely exclusively on lawmaker-led prayers. See, e.g., Mich.\n\nH.R. Rule 16 (requiring the clerk of the Michigan House of Representatives to “arrange\n\nfor a Member to offer an invocation” at the beginning of each session); Nat’l Conference\n\nof State Legislatures, supra, at 5-152 (the Rhode Island Senate); Kate Havard, In\n\ndelegates they trust: Md. House members lead secular prayer, Wash. Post (Mar. 9,\n\n2013),      https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/in-delegates-they-trust-md-\n\nhouse-members-lead-secular-prayer/2013/03/09/571fef8e-810a-11e2-8074-\n\nb26a871b165a_story.html.\n\n         Lawmaker-led prayer finds contemporary validation in the federal government as\n\nwell. Both houses of Congress allow members to deliver an opening invocation. The\n\ncongressional record is replete with examples of legislators commencing legislative\n\nbusiness with a prayer. See, e.g., 161 Cong. Rec. S3313 (daily ed. May 23, 2015) (prayer\n\nby Sen. James Lankford); 159 Cong. Rec. S3915 (daily ed. June 4, 2013) (prayer by Sen.\n\nWilliam M. Cowan); 155 Cong. Rec. S13401 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2009) (prayer by Sen.\n\n                                            82\n\fJohn Barrasso); 119 Cong. Rec. 17,441 (1973) (prayer by Rep. William H. Hudnut III);\n\nsee also 2 Robert C. Byrd, The Senate 1789-1989: Addresses on the History of the United\n\nStates Senate 305 (Wendy Wolff ed., 1990) (“Senators have, from time to time, delivered\n\nthe prayer.”).\n\n       Particularly relevant to this case, lawmaker-led prayers frequently accompany the\n\nopening of local governmental meetings. See, e.g., Br. of Amici Curiae State of West\n\nVirginia et al. Supporting Def.-Appellant at 24–26 & Add. 11–43. In many localities,\n\nthose prayers are exclusively lawmaker-led. See id.; see also Suppl. Br. of Amici Curiae\n\nState of West Virginia et al. Supporting Def.-Appellant Seeking Reversal at 9–10 &\n\nA10–A54.\n\n       In view of this long and varied tradition of lawmaker-led prayer, any wall barring\n\nelected legislators from religious invocations runs headlong into the Supreme Court’s\n\nacknowledgement that “[a]ny test [we] adopt[] must acknowledge a practice that was\n\naccepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political\n\nchange.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819. As Justice Alito aptly explained, “if there\n\nis any inconsistency between any [Establishment Clause] test[] and the historic practice\n\nof legislative prayer, the inconsistency calls into question the validity of the test, not the\n\nhistoric practice.” Id. at 1834 (Alito, J., concurring). The majority’s conclusion strikes\n\ndown a legislative prayer practice that is “part of the fabric of our society.” Id. at 1819\n\n(majority opinion).\n\n\n\n\n                                             83\n\f                                            2.\n\n       The majority couples its angst about the identity of the prayer giver in this case\n\nwith “legislators [being] the only eligible prayer-givers.” Majority Op. 17. That again is\n\na fact without constitutional significance. The fact that the overwhelming majority of the\n\nprayers represented the Christian faith stems not from any “aversion or bias on the part of\n\ntown leaders against minority faiths,” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824, but from the\n\ncomposition of the Board. Town of Greece made clear that the Constitution does not\n\nrequire the government actively court religious balance “[s]o long as the town maintains\n\na policy of nondiscrimination.” Id.; see also Pelphrey v. Cobb Cty., 547 F.3d 1263, 1281\n\n(11th Cir. 2008) (“[Marsh] does not require that all faiths be allowed the opportunity to\n\npray. The standard instead prohibits purposeful discrimination.”).\n\n       There is no indicia of discrimination in this record. None. Nor is there any\n\nsuggestion that the Board has or would bar any commissioner from offering a prayer\n\nfaithful to the commissioner’s own traditions, regardless of his or her faith. Without such\n\nevidence, we cannot conclude that the Board’s prayer practice unconstitutionally limits\n\nthe universe of prayer givers in violation of the Establishment Clause.\n\n       The majority implicitly acknowledges the lack of evidence in the record on this\n\npoint, and so instead faults the Board’s “rigid, restrictive” prayer practice as contrasted\n\nwith the “flexible, inclusive approach upheld in Town of Greece.” Majority Op. 24. That\n\nwidely misses the point.\n\n       Marsh and Town of Greece were both acceptable legislative prayer practices, but\n\nneither imposed a fixed standard for the nature or number of prayer givers that would be\n\n                                            84\n\fconstitutional. Just because the Supreme Court has upheld a more “flexible, inclusive\n\napproach” does not mean that other, more structured approaches are thereby\n\nunconstitutional. If anything, the prayer practice here is far more “inclusive” and multi-\n\nfaceted than the one the Supreme Court approved in Marsh, with only one prayer giver\n\nfrom one faith tradition. See infra Sec. II. Moreover, while Town of Greece’s practice\n\nresulted in a larger population of prayer givers, the majority elevates diversity to be the\n\nsine qua non of constitutionality.     See Majority Op. 23–25 (citing the need for a\n\nconstitutional practice to “embrac[e] religious pluralism and the possibility of a\n\ncorrespondingly diverse invocation practice,” and considering whether a particular prayer\n\npractice could be more welcoming or do more to “cultivate[] an atmosphere of greater\n\ntolerance and inclusion”); see also Majority Op. 32 (expounding that “legislative prayer\n\ngives voice to the ecumenical dimensions of religious faith”). But Marsh and Town of\n\nGreece do not require enforced ecumenicalism nor do they demand denominational\n\ndiversity; indeed, the Supreme Court expressly distanced itself from such a requirement.\n\nE.g., Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824 (rejecting the view that lawmaking bodies must\n\n“promote a diversity of religious views”). Instead, the Court focused on whether the\n\nlegislature’s practice—whatever that practice might be—evinces an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory motive. Here, the record reflects none.\n\n       In short, the Supreme Court’s prohibition on discrimination in this context is\n\naimed at barring government practices that result from a deliberate choice to favor one\n\nreligious view to the exclusion of others. As explained in Town of Greece, concerns arise\n\nonly if there is evidence of “an aversion or bias on the part of town leaders against\n\n                                            85\n\fminority faiths” in choosing the prayer giver. Id. The Marsh Court likewise alluded to\n\nthis requirement when it cautioned that the selection of a guest chaplain cannot stem from\n\n“an impermissible motive.” 463 U.S. at 793. This parameter is directed at the conscious\n\nselection of the prayer giver on account of religious affiliation or conscious\n\ndiscrimination against a prayer giver due to a religious affiliation. See id. Because\n\nthere’s no evidence of either in this record, the limited-universe of prayer givers does not\n\nviolate the principles espoused in Marsh and Town of Greece.\n\n       In another misreading of Supreme Court precedent, the majority contorts Marsh to\n\nfoster its novel rule mandating a broad universe of eligible prayer givers. A contextual\n\nreview of Marsh leads to the opposite conclusion: the Nebraska legislature paid the same\n\nPresbyterian minister to offer prayers for sixteen years. 463 U.S. at 785, 793. In\n\nrejecting the argument that this closed universe of prayer givers created a constitutional\n\nconcern, the Supreme Court observed, “[a]bsent proof that the chaplain’s reappointment\n\nstemmed from an impermissible motive, we conclude that his long tenure does not in\n\nitself conflict with the Establishment Clause.” Id. at 793–94. While it is true that other\n\nindividuals occasionally substituted for the Nebraska chaplain, the fact remained that the\n\noverwhelming majority of prayers during that sixteen-year period were given by a single\n\nstate-paid prayer giver from a single faith tradition. Even so—and entirely consistent\n\nwith the Court’s later statements in Town of Greece—that fact did not give rise to a\n\nconstitutional concern because there was, as here, no evidence of an impermissible\n\nmotive. 134 S. Ct. at 1824. Marsh’s facts and holding stand for the principle that the\n\nselection of a single legislative prayer giver, or a limited set of prayer givers, who\n\n                                            86\n\frepresent a single religious tradition does not advance any one faith or belief over\n\nanother. See 463 U.S. at 793 (“We cannot, any more than Members of the Congresses of\n\nthis century, perceive any suggestion that choosing a clergyman of one denomination\n\nadvances the beliefs of a particular church.”); Ctr. for Inquiry, Inc. v. Marion Circuit\n\nCourt Clerk, 758 F.3d 869, 874 (7th Cir. 2014) (“Marsh and Greece show that a\n\ngovernment may, consistent with the First Amendment, open legislative sessions with\n\nChristian prayers while not inviting leaders of other religions[.]”).\n\n       A fortiori, Town of Greece does not support the majority’s expansive view. Not\n\nonly are the legislators themselves the intended “congregation” for legislative prayer,\n\nTown of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1825 (plurality opinion), but the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized that legislative prayer practices carry special meaning to the thousands of\n\nlocal and state “citizen representatives” throughout this country. In fact, the Supreme\n\nCourt in Town of Greece specifically acknowledged “members of town boards and\n\ncommissions, who often serve part-time and as volunteers,” were lawmakers for whom\n\n“ceremonial prayer may . . . reflect the values they hold as private citizens.” Id. at 1826.\n\nTo repeat an earlier observation, if legislative prayer particularly reflects the values of\n\n“citizen representatives,” then it stands to reason that these “citizen representatives”\n\nshould be able to lead prayers in a way that connects with their intended audience:\n\nthemselves. Id. Legislators are uniquely qualified to offer uplifting, heartfelt prayer on\n\nmatters that concern themselves and their colleagues.\n\n       These precepts also demonstrate why lawmaker-led prayer does not, as the\n\nmajority misconstrues, violate the principle that governments not be in the business of\n\n                                             87\n\f“compos[ing] official prayers.” Compare Majority Op. 23 (quoting Lee v. Weisman, 505\n\nU.S. 577, 588 (1992)), with Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1822 (observing that requiring\n\nprayers to be nonsectarian “would involve government in religious matters to a far greater\n\ndegree than is the case under the town’s current practice of neither editing or approving\n\nprayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact” (emphasis added)).\n\n       Here, the Board’s practice does not venture into impermissible writing or editing\n\nof religious speech. Rather, each commissioner gives his or her own prayer without\n\noversight, input, or direction from the Board, which does not supervise or censor the\n\nspeech of its individual commissioners in crafting the prayers.        Indeed, there is no\n\nevidence that the Board, as a Board, had any role in any of the prayers given by any of\n\nthe individual commissioners. The record is devoid of any suggestion that any prayer in\n\nthis case is anything but a personal creation of each commissioner acting in accord with\n\nhis or her personal views. As a consequence, each commissioner is essentially a free\n\nagent no different from the ministers in Town of Greece or the paid chaplain in Marsh,\n\nwho gave invocations of their own choosing. Contrary to the majority’s conclusion, the\n\nBoard’s practice does not present the same concerns as when the “government [attempts]\n\nto define permissible categories of religious speech.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1822\n\n(emphasis added). Instead, the Board’s legislative prayer practice amounts to nothing\n\nmore than an individual commissioner leading a prayer of his or her own choosing.\n\n\n\n\n                                             88\n\f       For all these reasons, the majority errs in concluding that commissioners\n\ndelivering the ceremonial prayer to open a Board meeting is a relevant distinguishing\n\nfeature for the constitutional analysis set out Marsh and Town of Greece. 6\n\n                                                B.\n\n       As the identity of the legislative prayer givers at issue has no cognizable\n\nconstitutional significance in this case, I turn next to the remaining characteristics of the\n\nBoard’s prayer practice discussed by the majority:                content, coercion, and local\n\ngovernment setting.      Although the Supreme Court has not forged a comprehensive\n\ntemplate for all acceptable legislative prayer, its decisions set out guideposts for\n\nanalyzing whether a particular practice goes beyond constitutional bounds. See Snyder,\n\n159 F.3d at 1233 (“Marsh implicitly acknowledges some constitutional limits on the\n\nscope and selection of legislative prayers[.]”).\n\n                                                1.\n\n       As the majority points out, one of the guideposts to acceptable legislative prayers\n\nis the content of those prayers. After reaffirming the holding in Marsh that lower courts\n\nshould refrain from becoming embroiled in review of the substance of legislative prayer,\n\n\n       6\n           The majority also conjures up the “risk of political division” arising from alleged\nconflicts concerning the Board’s prayer practice. Majority Op. 26. But neither audience-\ninitiated criticism of those who object to a prayer practice nor election-oriented policy statements\nby Board candidates are relevant to the issue of law before the Court. Questions concerning the\nwisdom of the practice of legislative prayer can be rightly debated in many squares, but the\njudiciary is not one of them. The Court’s task is solely to decide whether the Board’s practice is\nlawful under the First Amendment, not whether it is popular or wise.\n\n\n\n\n                                                89\n\fTown of Greece noted that there could be certain sectarian actions that might cause a\n\nlegislative prayer practice to fall outside constitutional protection, such as “[i]f the course\n\nand practice over time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbelievers or religious\n\nminorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion.” 134 S. Ct. at 1823. In that\n\ncircumstance, the Court observed, “many present may consider the prayer to fall short of\n\nthe desire to elevate the purpose of the occasion and to unite lawmakers in their common\n\neffort.” Id.\n\n       To this end, courts need only assure themselves that sectarian legislative prayer,\n\nviewed from a cumulative perspective, is not being exploited to, inter alia, proselytize or\n\ndisparage. Less egregious conduct warrants no further review. Indeed, the Supreme\n\nCourt has disclaimed any interest in the content of legislative invocations, announcing a\n\nstrong disinclination “to embark on a sensitive evaluation or to parse the content of a\n\nparticular prayer.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 795. The record in this case demonstrates that the\n\nBoard’s prayer practice did not stray across the constitutional line of advancement,\n\nproselytization, or disparagement. In fact, the prayers here are much further from that\n\nline than those before the Supreme Court in Marsh and Town of Greece.\n\n       To reach the opposite conclusion, the majority selectively quotes a handful from\n\nthe hundreds of prayers offered in Board meetings to demonstrate what it perceives to be\n\nimpermissible “promotion” of Christianity. E.g., Majority Op. 28–32. But in so doing,\n\nthe majority untethers Town of Greece’s broader analysis from the specific prayers at\n\nissue in that case which the Supreme Court necessarily found did not cross any\n\nconstitutional line. Even a cursory comparison shows that the prayers highlighted by the\n\n                                              90\n\fmajority have less questionable language than that contained in the prayers upheld in\n\nMarsh and Town of Greece.\n\n      The content of the commissioners’ prayers largely encompassed universal themes,\n\nsuch as giving thanks and requesting divine guidance in deliberations, much in line with\n\nthe prayers challenged in Town of Greece. Cf. Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824\n\n(noting the prayers “invoked universal themes, as by celebrating the changing of the\n\nseasons or calling for a ‘spirit of cooperation’ among town leaders”). References to\n\nexclusively Christian concepts typically consisted of the opening or closing line, such as\n\n“In Jesus’ name. Amen,” exactly as in most prayers in Town of Greece. Compare Suppl.\n\nJ.A. 29–31, with Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824 (noting a “number of the prayers did\n\ninvoke the name of Jesus, the Heavenly Father, or the Holy Spirit”).\n\n       The invocation delivered at the Board’s October 17, 2011, meeting illustrates what\n\nBoard members and the public would typically hear:\n\n      Let us pray. Father we do thank you for the privilege of being here tonight.\n      We thank you for the beautiful day you’ve given us, for health and strength,\n      for all the things we take for granted. Lord, as we read in the paper today,\n      the economic times are not good, and many people are suffering and doing\n      without. We pray for them; we pray that you would help us to help. We\n      pray for the decisions that we will make tonight, that God, they would\n      honor and glorify you. We pray that you would give us wisdom and\n      understanding. We’ll thank you for it. In Jesus’ name. Amen.\n\nSuppl. J.A. 31.\n\n      Some of the commissioners’ prayers contained more direct references to Christian\n\nteachings, but so did the prayers in Town of Greece. E.g., Majority Op. 28–32 (quoting\n\nprayers from the record). For example, the following prayers in Town of Greece gave the\n\n\n                                           91\n\fSupreme Court no pause, but would be anathema and forbidden under the majority’s\n\nreasoning:\n\n   • “Let us pray. . . . Lord this evening we ask you especially to bless [the new\n     fire marshal and police captain]. Fill their hearts Lord with zeal to serve\n     your people, and Lord we ask you to bless us all, that everything we do\n     here tonight will move you to welcome us one day into your kingdom as\n     good and faithful servants.

We pray this evening for the\n       guidance of the Holy Spirit as the Greece Town Board meets.” Id. at *148–\n       50.\n\n       The prayers in Marsh invoked similarly pointed Christian themes, none of which\n\ncaused any constitutional question in the Supreme Court’s view. For example, one\n\nprayer contained the following language:\n\n              Father in heaven, the suffering and death of your son brought life to\n       the whole world moving our hearts to praise your glory. The power of the\n       cross reveals your concern for the world and the wonder of Christ crucified.\n              The days of his life-giving death and glorious resurrection are\n       approaching. This is the hour when he triumphed over Satan’s pride; the\n       time when we celebrate the great event of our redemption.\n              We are reminded of the price he paid when we pray with the\n       Psalmist[,]\n\nat which point the chaplain quoted from Psalm 22. Marsh, 463 U.S. at 823 n.2 (Stevens,\n\nJ., dissenting). And in a prayer offered before Easter one year, the Nebraska chaplain\n\nprayed, “Today as we are about to celebrate the great Holy Days of Christians and Jews,\n\nHoly Week and Passover, let us be reminded again through the faith and beliefs of our\n\nreligions of the principles and directives which should guide us. . . . May these Holy\n\nDays, then, enable us to act as true followers of the beliefs which we have and may it find\n\nexpression in every act and law that is passed.”       Joint Appendix at 108, Marsh v.\n\nChambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983) (No. 82–23), quoted in Snyder, 159 F.3d at 1234 n.11.\n\n       In short, the prayers actually offered in Marsh and Town of Greece contained the\n\nsame sort of pleas to the Christian God and to Jesus Christ, the same recognition of a\n\n\n                                            94\n\fChristian tenet of salvation and dependence on God’s favor, and the same generalized\n\nexhortations to obedience to Christian teachings as those prayers singled out for concern\n\nby the majority. If the prayers in Marsh and Town of Greece did not independently merit\n\nconcern as to content, then neither do the prayers offered in Rowan County.\n\n      Contrary to the majority’s consternation, the prayers in the case at bar do not,\n\ntaken together, reflect a pattern of proselytizing any more than those in Town of Greece\n\nor Marsh. The majority’s examples merely reflect sectarian themes that hew to Christian\n\ndoctrines. Other examples assume that the audience agrees with the prayer givers’ words\n\nor already shares a Christian viewpoint. Proselytization, in contrast, “means to seek to\n\n‘convert’ others to” “a particular religious belief,” Wynne, 376 F.3d at 300, meaning that\n\nit seeks a change from one view to a different one. But the prayers by the commissioners\n\nnever explicitly or implicitly ask the hearers to change beliefs, to adopt as true any\n\nprinciples of the Christian faith, or anything else traditionally understood to be words\n\nimploring conversion. In addition, none of the prayers here threaten damnation to those\n\nof different faiths, belittle or chastise dissenters, or denigrate any other religious\n\nviewpoints. See, e.g., Snyder, 159 F.3d at 1235 (finding the plaintiff’s proffered prayer\n\nunconstitutional because it “strongly disparage[d] other religious views” and “s[ought] to\n\nconvert his audience”).\n\n      Notably, although the majority concludes that the prayers “suggest[ed] that other\n\nfaiths are inferior,” it does not point to any language from the prayers maligning non-\n\nChristian beliefs. See Majority Op. 31. At most, it subjectively intuits the prayers\n\n“implicitly signaled disfavor toward non-Christians” whenever they “portray[ed] the\n\n                                           95\n\ffailure to love Jesus or follow his teachings as spiritual defects.” Majority Op. 31. That\n\nconclusion contradicts Town of Greece’s direct instruction that legislative prayers can be\n\nsectarian, and thus espouse Christian or other faith teachings. Distilled, the majority\n\nholds that any time a legislative prayer contains sectarian language favoring one belief it\n\nimplicitly signals disfavor toward sects that do not adhere to that belief. But that cannot\n\nbe what Town of Greece meant by denigrating other faiths because it expressly held that\n\nsectarian prayers do not cross this line.\n\n       Stripped of these considerations, what remains are passing references in only some\n\nof the prayers at issue that—at worst—merely approach the line drawn in Town of\n\nGreece. Given their paucity against the entire record, however, the prayers in this case\n\neasily meet the test articulated in Town of Greece, which held that a few stray remarks\n\nare insufficient to “despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and embraces our\n\ntradition” of legislative prayers. 134 S. Ct. at 1824. Or, to use Town of Greece’s other\n\nadmonition, even if certain phrases in a handful of prayers are questionable, the practice\n\nat issue as a whole does not show “a pattern of prayers that over time, denigrate,\n\nproselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose,” a legal condition precedent\n\nto any claim of a constitutional violation. Id.\n\n       Nor do the number of sectarian prayers and period of time at issue change the\n\nanalysis. Town of Greece’s reference to a “pattern of prayers . . . over time” must be\n\nunderstood in the context of that case.      The period at issue there was 1999 to 2010,\n\nwhich encompassed some 120 monthly meetings, and for all but the last three years in\n\nthat record, the prayers were offered solely from a Christian tradition. Even during those\n\n                                             96\n\flast three years, only four prayers were given from a non-Christian faith tradition. Id. at\n\n1839 (Breyer, J., dissenting). If those circumstances did not constitute an impermissible\n\npattern of prayers that advanced Christianity or otherwise crossed the line, neither do the\n\nfacts of this case.\n\n       Here, the complaint challenged the Board’s prayer practice from November 2007\n\nthrough March 2013, a much shorter period of time than that covered in Town of Greece,\n\nthough the meetings occurred twice a month rather than monthly. Suppl. J.A. 12–38.\n\nThe majority notes that “97% of the Board’s prayers mention[] ‘Jesus,’ ‘Christ,’ or the\n\n‘Savior.’” Majority Op. 6. Thus, in both Town of Greece and here, the prayers skewed\n\nheavily toward the Christian faith. Yet Greece’s prayer practice was not the ecumenical\n\nutopia the majority paints in order to cast Rowan County’s practice in a more negative\n\nlight. Viewed against the facts of Town of Greece, the Board’s practice crossed no\n\nconstitutional line.\n\n       The same cannot be said of the majority’s review of the Board’s practice: by\n\nengaging in such detailed parsing of both the words of individual prayers and the\n\npercentages of sectarian versus non-sectarian prayers, the majority violates the Supreme\n\nCourt’s instruction that courts should not be the “supervisors and censors of religious\n\nspeech.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1822. In other words, “[o]nce it invites prayer\n\ninto the public sphere, government must permit a prayer giver to address his or her own\n\nGod or gods as conscience dictates, unfettered by what an administrator or judge\n\nconsiders to be nonsectarian.” Id. at 1822–23 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                            97\n\f       The majority appears to prefer the pre-Town of Greece principle that legislative\n\nprayers must consist of generic, nonsectarian prayers that appease the broadest audience\n\nwhile offending the least. E.g., Majority Op. 29 (“[I]n considering whether government\n\nhas aligned itself with a particular religion, a tapestry of many faiths lessens that risk\n\nwhereas invoking only one exacerbates it.”); Majority Op. 32 (“At its best, legislative\n\nprayer gives voice to the ecumenical dimensions of religious faith.”); Majority Op. 38–39\n\n(“The ultimate criterion is simply one of conveying a message of respect and welcome\n\nfor persons of all beliefs and adopting a prayer practice that advances the core idea\n\nbehind legislative prayer, that people of many faiths may be united in a community of\n\ntolerance and devotion.”). The majority’s trouble with the ceremonial legislative prayer\n\nhere thus stems from its disagreement with the basic holding of Town of Greece. But that\n\ndisagreement cannot alter our role, as we are bound to faithfully apply the law articulated\n\nby the Supreme Court. ARA Servs., Inc. v. NLRB, 71 F.3d 129, 138 (4th Cir. 1995)\n\n(Motz, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[D]isagreement provides no basis\n\nfor refusing to follow a directive of the Supreme Court[.]”). That is judicial review run\n\namok, particularly in a context where the Supreme Court has exhorted restraint.\n\n       One of the majority’s recurring themes is that if Rowan County’s legislative\n\nprayer practice is constitutional, there would be no limits to the constitutionality of\n\nlegislative prayer. E.g., Majority Op. 41–43. Not so. As the above analysis observes,\n\nthe Board’s practice adheres to the constitutional limits set out in Marsh and Town of\n\nGreece. This conclusion does not ignore the boundaries both cases set for practices that\n\nwould cross a constitutional line. For example, prayers that implored the audience to\n\n                                            98\n\fattend a particular church would violate Town of Greece’s admonition that a prayer\n\npractice should not, over time, proselytize. Prayers that exhorted the hearers to renounce\n\ntheir faith tradition would similarly transgress this line.       So, too, one can easily\n\nunderstand Town of Greece’s concern that a legislative body could not, in fact, make\n\nofficial decisions based on whether a member of the public participated in, or voiced\n\nopposition to, the legislative prayer practice.    Contrary to the majority’s hyperbole,\n\nconcluding that the prayer practice at issue in this case is constitutional does not leave\n\nTown of Greece’s boundaries meaningless; far from it.\n\n                                             2.\n\n       The majority also finds constitutionally significant that the legislative prayer at\n\nissue here occurs before local government meetings as opposed to state or federal\n\nlegislatures.   See Majority Op. 36–39.       Rather than following Town of Greece’s\n\ninstructive analysis, the majority instead muses about local government meetings as\n\ndifferent than other legislative entities. For example, it notes that “[r]elative to sessions\n\nof Congress and state legislatures, the intimate setting of a municipal board meeting\n\npresents a heightened potential for coercion” because, inter alia, citizens routinely come\n\ndirectly before the board. Majority Op. 36. It also observes that the “Board exercises\n\nboth legislative authority . . . [and] quasi-adjudicatory power.” Majority Op. 36. And it\n\nfears “the intimacy of a town board meeting may push attendees to participate in the\n\nprayer practice in order to avoid the community’s disapproval,” or so “they would not\n\nstand out” just prior to the Board considering their petitions. Majority Op. 38. In so\n\n\n\n                                             99\n\fdoing, the majority draws on an argument posited by the petitioners in Town of Greece\n\nand firmly rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\n       Specifically, in Town of Greece the petitioners asserted that\n\n       the intimate setting of a town board meeting differs in fundamental ways\n       from the invocations delivered in Congress and state legislatures, where the\n       public remains segregated from legislative activity and may not address the\n       body except by occasional invitation. Citizens attend town meetings, on\n       the other hand, to accept awards; speak on matters of local importance; and\n       petition the board for action that may affect their economic interests, such\n       as the granting of permits, business licenses, and zoning variances. . . .\n       [T]he fact that board members in small towns know many of their\n       constituents by name only increases the pressure to conform.\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1824–25 (plurality opinion). In concluding none of these points affected the\n\nconstitutionality of Greece’s prayer practice, the Supreme Court plurality considered both\n\nthe history and purpose of legislative prayer.\n\n       First, the plurality measured legislative prayer “against the backdrop of historical\n\npractice.” Id. at 1825. As discussed above, lawmaker-led legislative prayer is part and\n\nparcel of the same historical roots as legislative prayer more broadly. Infra Sec. III.A.1.\n\nSimilarly, prayers at local government meetings are as historically rooted as prayers at\n\nthe state and federal levels. Id.; see also infra Sec. II (discussing Town of Greece).\n\n       Next, the plurality noted that “[t]he principal audience for these invocations is not,\n\nindeed, the public but lawmakers themselves.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1825\n\n(plurality opinion). In fact, the plurality found that legislative prayer has a particularly\n\nmeaningful personal connection “[f]or members of town boards and commissions, who\n\noften serve part-time and as volunteers,” precisely because it “reflect[s] the values they\n\nhold as private citizens. The prayer is an opportunity for them to show who and what\n\n                                            100\n\fthey are without denying the right to dissent by those who disagree.” Id. at 1826. That\n\nthe Supreme Court lauded the opportunity legislative prayer afforded local lawmakers to\n\nexpress their values highlights the majority’s perplexing conclusion here that prayer\n\npractices at the local level are actually more suspect. For the majority, it’s as if Town of\n\nGreece never happened.\n\n       Of course, this is not to say that legislative prayers cannot be coercive. But as the\n\nTown of Greece plurality recognized, “if town board members directed the public to\n\nparticipate in the prayers, singled out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicated that their\n\ndecisions might be influenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity,” then\n\ncoercion may exist. Id. (emphasis added). But the record here is devoid of those\n\nfeatures.\n\n       For example, the record does not show that the Board ever ordered public\n\nparticipation in its prayer services. Instead, the record presents precisely the sort of\n\nprocedure the Supreme Court approved in Town of Greece. There, “board members\n\nthemselves stood, bowed their heads, or made the sign of the cross during the prayer,\n\n[but] they at no point solicited similar gestures by the public.” Id. There’s no evidence\n\nin the record before this Court that any of the commissioners ever commanded or\n\ndemanded the public audience to rise or bow their heads, make the sign of the cross, or\n\notherwise make any symbol of religious expression during the prayer. And while the\n\nBoard extended the courtesy to those in attendance by inviting them to stand, there’s no\n\nevidence that anyone was required to do so. Tellingly, the Plaintiffs’ own evidence\n\nshows portions of the public audience simply chose not to participate. See J.A. 12\n\n                                            101\n\f(noting only “most” of the audience stood). That a simple invitation to join—which the\n\naudience was free to reject—could be twisted into coerced participation in a religious act\n\ndistorts the record. Instead, lower courts, including this one, must take the Supreme\n\nCourt’s counsel to heart and safely assume that mature adults can follow contextual cues\n\nwithout the risk of religious indoctrination. See Marsh, 463 U.S. at 792; Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1823 (“[A]dult citizens, firm in their own beliefs, can tolerate and perhaps\n\nappreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a person of a different faith.”).\n\n       In Town of Greece, the prayer givers often asked the audience “to rise for the\n\nprayer” by extending invitations such as “Would you bow your heads with me as we\n\ninvite the Lord’s presence here tonight?”; “Let us join our hearts and minds together in\n\nprayer”; and “Would you join me in a moment of prayer?” 134 S. Ct. at 1826 (plurality\n\nopinion).   Here, the designated commissioner would similarly offer a ceremonial\n\ninvocation that typically started with “let us pray” or “please pray with me.” Such\n\ntransitional and prefatory courtesy hardly constitutes coercion under the Supreme Court’s\n\nguidance. No case, before or after Town of Greece, stands for that principle. To the\n\ncontrary, for coercion to be found the government must “orchestrate[] the performance of\n\na formal religious exercise in a fashion that practically obliges the involvement of non-\n\nparticipants.” Myers, 418 F.3d at 406. And in the context of legislative prayer, coercion\n\nmust be measured “against the backdrop of historical practice” in which reasonable\n\nobservers are deemed to be familiar with the tradition and purpose of a ceremonial prayer\n\nto open a legislative session. Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1825 (plurality opinion).\n\nViewed through that lens, no reasonable person would interpret a commissioner’s\n\n                                            102\n\fcommonplace and “almost reflexive” opening line of “let us pray” to compel their\n\nsubmission to the prayer. Cf. id. at 1832 (Alito, J., concurring). Such standard openings\n\nhave been routinely offered for over two centuries in the U.S. Congress, the state\n\nlegislatures, and countless local bodies. In short, such innocuous language cannot be\n\nwhat the Supreme Court contemplated when it expressed concern about prayer givers\n\n“direct[ing] the public to participate in the prayers.” Id. at 1826 (plurality opinion).\n\n       Plaintiffs, the district court, and the majority assert that the Board’s prayer practice\n\nmade audience members feel subjectively “excluded at meetings” and that the Board’s\n\n“disagreement with [their] public opposition to sectarian prayer could make [them] less\n\neffective advocate[s].” See Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 715–16. This is a failed argument.\n\nTown of Greece explicitly rejected the same claim that perceived “subtle pressure to\n\nparticipate in prayers that violate their beliefs in order to please the board members from\n\nwhom they are about to seek a favorable ruling” constitutes coercion. 134 S. Ct. at 1825\n\n(plurality opinion). Merely exposing constituents to prayer they may find offensive is not\n\nenough. “[I]n the general course[,] legislative bodies do not engage in impermissible\n\ncoercion merely by exposing constituents to prayer they would rather not hear and in\n\nwhich they need not participate.” Id. at 1827.\n\n       Nor did the Board’s prayer practice “chastise[] dissenters []or attempt[] lengthy\n\ndisquisition on religious dogma.” Id. at 1826. Rather, as illustrated above, the prayer\n\ncontent largely followed the spirit of solemn, respectful prayer approved in Marsh and\n\nTown of Greece. Moreover, the record shows that both attendance and participation in\n\nthe invocations were voluntary. The Board has represented without contradiction that\n\n                                             103\n\fmembers of the public were free “to remain seated or to otherwise disregard the\n\nInvocation in a manner that [was] not disruptive.” J.A. 277. Thus, as a practical matter,\n\ncitizens attending a Board meeting who found the prayers objectionable were not without\n\nrecourse; they could arrive after the invocation, leave for the duration of the prayer, or\n\nremain for the prayer without participating, just like the audiences in Marsh and Town of\n\nGreece. To the extent individuals like Plaintiffs elected to stay, “their quiet acquiescence\n\n[would] not, in light of our traditions, be interpreted as an agreement with the words or\n\nideas expressed.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1827 (plurality opinion).\n\n       By suggesting that audience members should not be required to arrive “after the\n\nprayer, leave the room before the prayer, or simply stay seated” because doing so “served\n\nonly to marginalize,” Majority Op. 38, the majority rejects the precise actions the\n\nSupreme Court approved in Town of Greece. 134 S. Ct. at 1827 (plurality opinion)\n\n(“Nothing in the record suggests that members of the public are dissuaded from leaving\n\nthe meeting room during the prayer, arriving late, or even, as happened here, making a\n\nlater protest. In this case, as in Marsh, board members and constituents are free to enter\n\nand leave with little comment and for any number of reasons. Should nonbelievers\n\nchoose to exit the room during a prayer they find distasteful, their absence will not stand\n\nout as disrespectful or even noteworthy.          And should they remain, their quiet\n\nacquiescence will not, in light of our traditions, be interpreted as an agreement with the\n\nwords or ideas expressed. Neither choice represents an unconstitutional imposition as to\n\nmature adults[.]”).\n\n\n\n                                            104\n\f       The record is similarly devoid of evidence that anyone who chose not to\n\nparticipate during the prayer suffered adverse consequences, that their absence was\n\nperceived as disrespectful or was recognized by the Board in any way. To the contrary,\n\nthe Board has attested, again without contradiction, that such conduct would have “no\n\nimpact on [the constituent’s] right to fully participate in the public meeting, including\n\naddressing the commission and participating in the agenda items in the same manner as\n\npermitted any citizen of Rowan County.” J.A. 277. Plaintiffs point us to no evidence to\n\nthe contrary. Thus, it is implausible on this record to suggest that Plaintiffs were “in a\n\nfair and real sense” coerced to participate in the exercise of legislative prayer. Lee, 505\n\nU.S. at 586. In short, there’s no evidence that “town leaders allocated benefits and\n\nburdens based on participation in the prayer, or that citizens were received differently\n\ndepending on whether they joined the invocation or quietly declined.” Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1826 (plurality opinion).\n\n       As it must do given the record, the majority concedes that it is not “suggest[ing]\n\nthat the commissioners made decisions based on whether an attendee participated in the\n\nprayers.” Majority Op. 37. Nonetheless, the majority divines constitutional jeopardy in\n\nthe juxtaposition of ceremonial prayer immediately prior to Board business. See Majority\n\nOp. 37. That distinction lacks meaning given that legislative prayer is a ceremonial\n\nprayer practice that occurs at the start of a legislative meeting where a legislative body\n\npresumably intends to engage in legislative work. More to the point, Rowan County’s\n\nmeeting process is precisely that approved by the Supreme Court in Town of Greece. 134\n\nS. Ct. at 1823 (“The relevant constraint derives from [the prayer’s] place at the opening\n\n                                           105\n\fof legislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values\n\nlong part of the Nation’s heritage.”).\n\n       Significantly, at no time did the Supreme Court in Town of Greece suggest that\n\nlegislative prayers at a local government meeting inherently presented any constitutional\n\nissue. Yet the innate qualities of local government meetings are where the majority\n\ndirects its concerns. E.g., Majority Op. 36 (“[T]he intimate setting of a municipal board\n\nmeeting presents a heightened potential for coercion.”); Majority Op. 36 (“[T]he\n\ncommissioners consider[] citizen petitions shortly after the invocation,” and “the Board\n\nexercises both legislative authority over questions of general public importance as well as\n\na quasi-adjudicatory power over such granular issues as zoning petitions, permit\n\napplications, and contract awards.”); Majority Op. 38 (“[T]he intimacy of a town board\n\nmeeting may push attendees to participate in the prayer practice in order to avoid the\n\ncommunity’s disapproval.”). If any of these inherent characteristics conflicted with the\n\nFirst Amendment, it would have been addressed in the Supreme Court’s decision in Town\n\nof Greece because those circumstances were squarely part of that case and those\n\narguments were made to the Court. But the Supreme Court rejected those claims, and the\n\nmajority plainly errs by rejecting the course laid out by the Supreme Court.\n\n       Drawing on distinctions noted in Justice Alito’s concurring and Justice Kagan’s\n\ndissenting opinions in Town of Greece, the majority also cobbles together a distinction\n\nbetween prayers offered before the totality of a local governmental meeting and those\n\nsaid before a legislative portion of the meeting as distinct from an adjudicatory phase of\n\nthe meeting. Majority Op. 36–37. But the majority in Town of Greece relied on no such\n\n                                            106\n\fdemarcation. The only relevant point in terms of order was that legislative prayer has\n\nhistorically been offered—as it was in Marsh and Town of Greece—at the “opening of\n\nlegislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values\n\nlong part of the Nation’s heritage” and “invite[] lawmakers to reflect upon shared ideals\n\nand common ends before they embark on the fractious business of governing.” Town of\n\nGreece, 134 S. Ct. at 1823. The legislative prayers here similarly occur at the opening of\n\nthe Board’s meeting as part of the ceremonial part of the meeting that also includes the\n\nPledge of Allegiance. It occurs before any Board business, whether adjudicative or\n\nlegislative. The majority’s quibble finds no support in Town of Greece’s holding.\n\n       Because the Supreme Court has already rejected the concerns about the intimacy\n\nof legislative prayer before a local government meeting, that factor has no bearing on the\n\nconstitutionality of Rowan County’s practice. But the equally troubling result is that the\n\nrest of the majority’s analysis applies with the same force to local, state, and federal\n\nlegislatures. It will no doubt come as a surprise to members of the United States House\n\nof Representatives and Senate to learn that neither Marsh nor Town of Greece protect\n\ntheir right to offer legislative prayer.\n\n\n\n                                           IV.\n\n       Make no mistake, while the majority purports to have no problem with the idea of\n\nlawmaker-led legislative prayer in the abstract, its reasoning actually leaves no room for\n\nlawmakers to engage in the full panoply of legislative prayer practices to which Town of\n\nGreece grants constitutional protection. The lawmaker’s mere status as a prayer giver is\n\n                                           107\n\fviewed with immediate skepticism, and any sectarian content to his or her prayers is\n\ndeemed to have an added coercive effect. Moreover, the majority refrains from providing\n\nany guidelines as to when, if ever, lawmaker-led legislative prayers can meet their newly\n\nminted constitutional standards. Majority Op. 38–39. Indeed, the only safe practice for\n\nlawmakers who want to offer a legislative prayer is to ignore what Marsh and Town of\n\nGreece permit and offer only a generic prayer to a generic god.\n\n       The Rowan County legislative prayer practice falls within the historical traditions\n\nrecognized in Marsh and Town of Greece and the principles the Supreme Court\n\narticulated in both cases. It is constitutional.\n\n       For all these reasons, I would reverse the district court’s judgment and enter final\n\njudgment for Rowan County. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                              108\n\f",

For years on end, the elected\n\nmembers of the county’s Board of Commissioners composed and delivered pointedly\n\nsectarian invocations. They rotated the prayer opportunity amongst themselves; no one\n\nelse was permitted to offer an invocation. The prayers referenced one and only one faith\n\nand veered from time to time into overt proselytization. Before each invocation, attendees\n\nwere requested to rise and often asked to pray with the commissioners. The prayers\n\nserved to open meetings of our most basic unit of government and directly preceded the\n\nbusiness session of the meeting. The district court, applying the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Town of Greece v. Galloway, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2674862\"><a href=\"/opinion/2674862/town-of-greece-v-galloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1811</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014), held the county’s prayer\n\npractice unconstitutional. A panel of this court reversed. See Lund v. Rowan Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2016). The full court then granted rehearing en banc.\n\n       We conclude that the Constitution does not allow what happened in Rowan\n\nCounty. The prayer practice served to identify the government with Christianity and\n\nrisked conveying to citizens of minority faiths a message of exclusion. And because the\n\ncommissioners were the exclusive prayer-givers, Rowan County’s invocation practice\n\nfalls well outside the more inclusive, minister-oriented practice of legislative prayer\n\ndescribed in Town of Greece. Indeed, if elected representatives invite their constituents to\n\nparticipate in prayers invoking a single faith for meeting upon meeting, year after year, it\n\nis difficult to imagine constitutional limits to sectarian prayer practice.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f       The great promise of the Establishment Clause is that religion will not operate as\n\nan instrument of division in our nation. Consistent with this principle, there is a time-\n\nhonored tradition of legislative prayer that reflects the respect of each faith for other\n\nfaiths and the aspiration, common to so many creeds, of finding higher meaning and\n\ndeeper purpose in these fleeting moments each of us spends upon this earth. Instead of\n\ndrawing on this tradition, Rowan County elevated one religion above all others and\n\naligned itself with that faith. It need not be so. As the history of legislative invocations\n\ndemonstrates, the desire of this good county for prayer at the opening of its public\n\nsessions can be realized in many ways that further both religious exercise and religious\n\ntolerance.\n\n                                              I.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       We begin by describing the challenged prayer practice itself. Rowan County,\n\nNorth Carolina is governed by an elected body known as the Rowan County Board of\n\nCommissioners. The five-member Board convenes twice a month. The commissioners sit\n\nat the front of the room facing their constituents.\n\n       Each Board meeting begins in the same way: with a prayer composed and\n\ndelivered by one of the commissioners. After calling the meeting to order, the\n\nchairperson asks everyone in attendance—commissioners and constituents alike—to\n\nstand up. All five Board members rise and bow their heads, along with most of the\n\nattendees. A commissioner then asks the community to join him in worship, using\n\nphrases such as “Let us pray,” “Let’s pray together,” or “Please pray with me.” The\n\n                                              5\n\finvocations end with a communal “Amen,” and the Pledge of Allegiance follows a\n\nmoment later. Next, the Board typically approves the previous meeting’s minutes,\n\nschedules future items of business, and holds a public comment period before continuing\n\non to the day’s work.\n\n       Board members rotate the prayer opportunity amongst themselves as a matter of\n\nlong-standing custom. The content of the prayer is “entirely at the discretion of the\n\ncommissioner.” J.A. 284. 1 No one outside the Board is permitted to offer an invocation.\n\n       The prayers are invariably and unmistakably Christian in content. Over the five-\n\nand-a-half years for which video recordings are available, 97% of the Board’s prayers\n\nmentioned “Jesus,” “Christ,” or the “Savior.” See Lund v. Rowan Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">712</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 714 (M.D.N.C. 2015). No religion other than Christianity was represented. Sectarian\n\nreferences often appeared at the conclusion of the prayer. See, e.g., S.A. 14 (prayer of\n\nApril 21, 2008) (“I ask all these things in the name of Jesus, the King of Kings and the\n\nLord of Lords. Amen.”). Several prayers confessed sin and asked for forgiveness on the\n\ncommunity’s behalf. See, e.g., S.A. 30 (prayer of August 1, 2011) (“Lord, we confess that\n\nwe have not loved you with all our heart, and mind and strength, and that we have not\n\nloved one another as Christ loves us. We have also neglected to follow the guidance of\n\nyour Holy Spirit, and have allowed sin to enter into our lives.”). Other prayers implied\n\nthat Christianity was superior to other faiths. See, e.g., S.A. 33 (prayer of March 5, 2012)\n\n(“[A]s we pick up the Cross, we will proclaim His name above all names, as the only way\n\n\n       1\n           “J.A.” refers to the Joint Appendix; “S.A.” refers to the Supplemental Appendix.\n\n                                              6\n\fto eternal life.”). On occasion, Board members appeared to implore attendees to accept\n\nChristianity. See, e.g., S.A. 21 (prayer of October 5, 2009) (“Father, I pray that all may be\n\none as you, Father, are in Jesus, and He in you. I pray that they may be one in you, that\n\nthe world may believe that you sent Jesus to save us from our sins.”).\n\n       In response to the growing controversy over the prayer practice, a number of\n\ncommissioners publicly announced that they would continue delivering Christian\n\ninvocations for the community’s benefit. Prior to the filing of this lawsuit, the American\n\nCivil Liberties Union of North Carolina Legal Foundation notified the Board that\n\nsectarian prayers violated the Establishment Clause under then-applicable Fourth Circuit\n\nprecedent. The Board did not respond, but several members stated that they would not\n\nstop praying in Jesus’ name. “[A]sking for guidance for my decisions from Jesus,” one\n\ncommissioner explained, “is the best I, and Rowan County, can ever hope for.” Lund, 103\n\nF. Supp. 3d at 715 (quoting Commissioner Ford). Another commissioner remarked, “I\n\nvolunteer to be the first to go to jail for this cause . . . .” Id. (quoting Commissioner\n\nSides). After the district court enjoined the county prayer practice, a third commissioner\n\nissued a statement noting, “I will always pray in the name of Jesus. . . . God will lead me\n\nthrough this persecution and I will be His instrument.” See Pls.’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot.\n\nSumm. J. at 9 (quoting Commissioner Barber).\n\n                                             B.\n\n       The three plaintiffs in this case are long-time residents of Rowan County. Active\n\nin the community, each one has attended multiple Board meetings to follow issues of\n\npublic importance. Nancy Lund, a volunteer tutor, cares about school funding. So does\n\n                                             7\n\fLiesa Montag-Siegel, a retired middle school librarian. Robert Voelker is interested in\n\neducation policy and the county’s provision of social services. The plaintiffs, none of\n\nwhom identify as Christian, encountered prayers of the sort described above at Board\n\nmeetings.\n\n       In March 2013, Lund and her co-plaintiffs filed this action against Rowan County,\n\nasserting that the Board’s prayer practice violated the Establishment Clause. They argued\n\nthat the Board, by delivering exclusively Christian prayers, affiliated the county with\n\nChristianity, advanced Christianity, and coerced the plaintiffs into participating in\n\nreligious exercises. According to the plaintiffs, the prayers “sen[t] a message that the\n\nCounty and the Board favor Christians” and caused the plaintiffs to feel “excluded from\n\nthe community and the local political process.” J.A. 11-12. The plaintiffs also averred\n\nthat they felt compelled to stand for the invocations to avoid sticking out. Voelker added\n\nthat he felt pressured to stand because “the invocation is immediately followed by the\n\nPledge of Allegiance, for which [he] feels strongly that he needs to stand.” J.A. 12. At\n\none meeting, Voelker proposed a nondenominational prayer and later worried that his\n\n“open questioning” of the Board’s sectarian invocations would impair his advocacy on\n\nother matters. J.A. 13. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as a\n\npreliminary injunction against sectarian prayers at Board meetings.\n\n       Rowan County responded with affidavits from each Board member adding new\n\ndetails on the prayer practice. According to these affidavits, the Board has no written\n\npolicy on the invocations. The commissioners also claimed that the Board has “no\n\nexpectation . . . regarding the form or content” of the prayers, J.A. 291, which are offered\n\n                                             8\n\f“for the edification and benefit of the commissioners and to solemnize the meeting,” J.A.\n\n293. Finally, the affidavits clarified that attendees may leave the room or arrive after the\n\ninvocation and that the Board “respects the right of any citizen” to remain seated or\n\ndisregard the invocation. J.A. 277.\n\n       After the district court preliminarily enjoined the Board from delivering sectarian\n\nprayers, the Supreme Court decided Town of Greece v. Galloway. The Court upheld the\n\ntown’s practice of opening its legislative sessions with sectarian prayers and ruled that\n\nsectarian prayers, while subject to some limits, are constitutional as a general matter.\n\n       In light of Town of Greece, both the plaintiffs and Rowan County moved for\n\nsummary judgment. The district court held that Rowan County’s prayer practice\n\nremained unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction. Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at\n\n733-34. The court found that the practice was unconstitutionally coercive and “deviate[d]\n\nfrom the long-standing history and tradition” of legislative prayer. Id. at 723. That\n\ntradition, as articulated by the Supreme Court, involved the delivery of prayers by “a\n\nchaplain, separate from the legislative body.” Id. Here, the court reasoned, the prayers\n\nwere “exclusively prepared and controlled” and delivered by the government,\n\n“constituting a much greater and more intimate government involvement in the prayer\n\npractice than that at issue in Town of Greece.” Id. Further, restricting the prayer\n\nopportunity to the Board resulted in “a closed-universe of prayer-givers . . . who favored\n\nreligious beliefs believed to be common to the majority of voters in Rowan County.” Id.\n\nThe district court noted that although lawmaker-led prayer “is not per se\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\funconstitutional,” the prayer-giver’s identity is relevant to the constitutional inquiry “in\n\nrelation to the surrounding circumstances.” Id. at 722 n.4.\n\n       On appeal, this court reversed the district court’s judgment and upheld the\n\ncounty’s prayer practice. Lund, 837 F.3d at 411-31. The panel majority recognized that\n\n“[t]he five commissioners, all Christian, ‘maintain[ed] exclusive and complete control\n\nover the content of the prayers.’” Id. at 434 (quoting Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 733).\n\nNonetheless, the majority held that the identity of the prayer-giver was not “a significant\n\nconstitutional distinction, at least in the context of this case.” Id. at 420. Having\n\ndiscounted the source of the prayer as a relevant consideration, the majority next\n\nexamined the other elements of the Board’s practice seriatim. The majority held that the\n\npractice was consistent with tradition as outlined in Town of Greece and was not\n\ncoercive. Id. at 430.\n\n       Judge Wilkinson dissented. The dissent argued that the “combination of legislators\n\nas the sole prayer-givers, official invitation for audience participation, consistently\n\nsectarian prayers referencing but a single faith, and the intimacy of a local governmental\n\nsetting exceed[ed] even a broad reading of Town of Greece.” Id. at 431 (Wilkinson, J.,\n\ndissenting) (hereinafter panel dissent). After examining “the interaction among elements\n\nspecific to this case,” id. at 433, the dissent concluded that the county’s prayer practice\n\nwas unconstitutional.\n\n       We granted rehearing en banc, and we now affirm.

Legislative prayer “lends gravity to public business, reminds\n\nlawmakers to transcend petty differences in pursuit of a higher purpose, and expresses a\n\ncommon aspiration to a just and peaceful society.” Id. at 1818 (majority opinion). Owing\n\nto its unique history and longstanding role in public life, legislative prayer occupies “a\n\nfield of Establishment Clause jurisprudence with its own set of boundaries and\n\nguidelines.” Simpson, 404 F.3d at 281. 2\n\n      But the general principles animating the Establishment Clause remain relevant\n\neven in the context of legislative prayer. First, the Constitution “affirmatively mandates\n\naccommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any.”\n\nLynch v. Donnelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111113\"><a href=\"/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 673 (1984). Second, the government “may not coerce\n\nanyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way\n\nwhich ‘establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.’” Lee v.\n\nWeisman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 587 (1992) (quoting Lynch, 465 U.S. at 678).

An\n\ninstrument of social peace, the Establishment Clause does not become less so when social\n\nrancor runs exceptionally high.\n\n       In addition, “[b]y pairing the Free Exercise Clause with the Establishment\n\nClause,” the Framers sought to prevent government from choosing sides on matters of\n\nfaith and to protect religious minorities from exclusion or punishment at the hands of the\n\nstate. Lund, 837 F.3d at 438 (panel dissent). “Americans are encouraged to practice and\n\ncelebrate their faith but not to establish it through the state.” Id.\n\n       In the legislative prayer context, the Supreme Court has given meaning to the\n\nabstract guarantees of the Establishment Clause by considering “historical practices and\n\nunderstandings.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThis history “shed[s] light on how the Founders viewed the Establishment Clause in\n\nrelation to legislative prayer.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 414. The resulting principles, first\n\nelucidated in Marsh v. Chambers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111014\"><a href=\"/opinion/111014/marsh-v-chambers/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), and refined in Town of Greece,\n\nreflect “what history reveals was the contemporaneous understanding” of the\n\nEstablishment Clause. Lynch, 465 U.S. at 673.\n\n       Marsh and Town of Greece, however, in no way sought to dictate the outcome of\n\nevery subsequent case. The Court acknowledged that it has not “define[d] the precise\n\nboundary of the Establishment Clause.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819.\n\nAccordingly, when the historical principles articulated by the Supreme Court do not\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fdirect a particular result, a court must conduct a “fact-sensitive” review of the prayer\n\npractice. Id. at 1825 (plurality opinion).\n\n       Marsh and Town of Greece do not settle whether Rowan County’s prayer practice\n\nis constitutional. Those decisions did not concern lawmaker-led prayer, nor did they\n\ninvolve the other unusual aspects of the county’s prayer practice. And they certainly did\n\nnot address the confluence of these elements. That said, Marsh and Town of Greece\n\nprovide our doctrinal starting point. We shall begin by describing the principles they\n\ndeveloped and then proceed to apply those principles to this case.\n\n                                             A.\n\n       In Marsh v. Chambers, the Supreme Court upheld the Nebraska legislature’s\n\npractice of opening its sessions with nonsectarian prayers delivered by a paid chaplain.\n\n463 U.S. at 793 n. 14. The Court noted that legislative prayer “has coexisted with the\n\nprinciples of disestablishment and religious freedom” since the colonial period. Id. at\n\n786. In addition, the First Congress “authorized the appointment of paid chaplains”\n\nshortly after finalizing language for the First Amendment. Id. at 788. Accordingly, the\n\nCourt reasoned, the Framers could not have viewed “paid legislative chaplains and\n\nopening prayers as a violation of that Amendment.” Id.\n\n       Marsh, then, stands for the principle that “legislative prayer, while religious in\n\nnature, has long been understood as compatible with the Establishment Clause.” Town of\n\nGreece, 134 S. Ct. at 1818. But even as the Court concluded that legislative prayer is\n\nconstitutional as a general matter, Marsh recognized certain limits on the practice.\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fNamely, the prayer opportunity may not be “exploited to proselytize or advance [a\n\nparticular faith] or to disparage any other.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 794-95.\n\n       Thirty years later, in Town of Greece v. Galloway, the Court held that sectarian\n\nprayer is not by itself unconstitutional. 134 S. Ct. at 1820. In that case, the town board in\n\nGreece, New York began its monthly meetings with sectarian invocations given by\n\nvolunteer guest ministers. Id. at 1816. Because “nearly all of the congregations in town\n\nturned out to be Christian,” most of the ministers were Christian too. Id. at 1824.\n\nNonetheless, the town also invited a Jewish layman and Baha’i practitioner to deliver\n\nprayers and granted a Wiccan priestess’s request to do so. Id. at 1817. The town “neither\n\nreviewed the prayers in advance of the meetings nor provided guidance as to their tone or\n\ncontent.” Id. at 1816.\n\n       Invoking the historical tradition first described in Marsh, the Court held that the\n\nEstablishment Clause does not require “nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single,\n\nfixed standard.” Id. at 1820. As a result, “a challenge based solely on the content of a\n\nprayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation.” Id. at 1824 (emphasis added).\n\n       At the same time, the Court was quick to clarify that invocation content is still\n\ngermane to the constitutionality of a prayer practice. The “relevant constraint” on faith-\n\nspecific prayer “derives from its place at the opening of legislative sessions, where it is\n\nmeant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of the Nation’s\n\nheritage.” Id. at 1823. Prayer that “invites lawmakers to reflect upon shared ideals and\n\ncommon ends before they embark on the fractious business of governing” serves that\n\npurpose. Id. But the Establishment Clause does not countenance prayers that “denigrate\n\n                                             14\n\fnonbelievers or religious minorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion” or, per\n\nMarsh, prayers that proselytize or advance or disparage a particular faith. Id.\n\n       Applying these principles, the Court concluded that the sectarian prayers offered\n\nby guest ministers fell within the historical tradition outlined in Marsh. Id. at 1824. The\n\nCourt also emphasized that Greece selected chaplains without discriminating among\n\nfaiths and “welcome[d] a prayer by any minister or layman who wished to give one.” Id.\n\n       Finally, the Court concluded that the town’s prayer practice did not coerce\n\nparticipation by meeting attendees. Id. at 1828. While no single test commanded a\n\nmajority, Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the plurality explained that “[t]he analysis would\n\nbe different if town board members directed the public to participate in the prayers,\n\nsingled out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicated that their decisions might be\n\ninfluenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity.” Id. at 1826.\n\n                                             B.\n\n       Marsh and Town of Greece thus show a Court generally supportive of legislative\n\nprayer, careful to emphasize that sectarian references are permissible in proper context,\n\nbut cautioning that the prayer opportunity not get out of hand. This case differs from\n\nMarsh and Town of Greece in two crucial respects that, in combination with other aspects\n\nof the Board’s prayers, give rise to an unprecedented prayer practice. First, whereas guest\n\nministers delivered the prayers in those cases, the legislators themselves gave the\n\ninvocations in Rowan County. Second, the prayer opportunity here was exclusively\n\nreserved for the commissioners, creating a “closed-universe” of prayer-givers. Lund, 103\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fF. Supp. 3d at 723. This case is therefore “more than a factual wrinkle on Town of\n\nGreece.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 431 (panel dissent). “It is a conceptual world apart.” Id.\n\n       To begin, Town of Greece simply does not address the constitutionality of\n\nlawmaker-led prayer. The Court has “consistently discussed legislative prayer practices\n\nin terms of invited ministers, clergy, or volunteers providing the prayer.” Lund, 103 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 722. And in elaborating on our national tradition of legislative prayer—the\n\nhistory informing its interpretation of the Establishment Clause—the Court has “not once\n\ndescribed a situation in which the legislators themselves gave the invocation.” Id. Town\n\nof Greece instead recounts how “[t]he First Congress made it an early item of business to\n\nappoint and pay official chaplains,” adding that “both the House and Senate have\n\nmaintained the office virtually uninterrupted since that time.” 134 S. Ct. at 1818\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       To the extent that Town of Greece touches on the constitutional relevance of the\n\nprayer-giver’s identity, the decision takes for granted the use of outside clergy. The Court\n\nemphasized that the town “neither edit[ed] [n]or approv[ed] prayers” offered by the guest\n\nministers. Id. at 1822. Addressing the fact that attendees were asked to stand, the plurality\n\nreasoned that “[t]hese requests . . . came not from town leaders but from the guest\n\nministers, who presumably are accustomed to directing their congregations in this way.”\n\nId. at 1826. And “[t]he inclusion of a brief, ceremonial prayer as part of a larger exercise\n\nin civic recognition,” the plurality explained, “suggests that its purpose and effect are to\n\nacknowledge religious leaders and the institutions they represent.” Id. at 1827.\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       Thus the historical “practice of prayer,” at least as described by the Supreme\n\nCourt, is not entirely “similar to that now challenged.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 791. In Rowan\n\nCounty, the commissioners themselves, not guest ministers, led the community in prayer,\n\nand they composed each invocation “according to their personal faiths.” Lund, 103 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 724; see J.A. 275-94 (affidavits of the commissioners). Relative to Town of\n\nGreece, the county’s prayer practice featured “much greater and more intimate\n\ngovernment involvement.” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 723. The conspicuous absence of\n\ncase law on lawmaker-led prayer is likely no accident. As elaborated below, this type of\n\nprayer both identifies the government with religion more strongly than ordinary\n\ninvocations and heightens the constitutional risks posed by requests to participate and by\n\nsectarian prayers.\n\n       This is especially true where legislators are the only eligible prayer-givers. Both\n\nTown of Greece and Marsh involved open, inclusive prayer opportunities. In the former\n\ncase, the town “at no point excluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be prayer\n\ngiver,” and town leaders affirmed that “a minister or layperson of any persuasion,\n\nincluding an atheist, could give the invocation.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1816.\n\nMarsh emphasized that the ordinary chaplain “was not the only clergyman heard by the\n\nLegislature; guest chaplains . . . officiated at the request of various legislators and as\n\nsubstitutes during [the regular chaplain’s] absences.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 793. The\n\nopenness evinced by these other elected bodies contrasts starkly with Rowan County’s\n\npolicy of restricting the prayer opportunity to the commissioners alone.\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f       Marsh and Town of Greece, while supportive of legislative prayer, were measured\n\nand balanced decisions. See 134 S. Ct. at 1824-25 (describing the proper inquiry as “fact-\n\nsensitive” and the analysis as “an inquiry into the prayer opportunity as a whole”). The\n\ndissents in this case, by contrast, are wholly bereft of any sense of balance. Any balanced\n\nassessment of Marsh and Town of Greece makes clear the dissents’ lack of fidelity to\n\nthose decisions. The dissents’ reading of Town of Greece is faithful only to what the\n\ndissents wish that opinion would say, not to what it actually said. As Town of Greece\n\nmakes plain, the Court has never approved anything like what has transpired here or\n\nanything resembling the dissents’ invitation to local government to work sectarian\n\npractices into public meetings in whatever manner it wishes. Id. at 1826. Rather Town of\n\nGreece told the inferior federal courts to do exactly what the majority has done here—\n\nthat is to grant local governments leeway in designing a prayer practice that brings the\n\nvalues of religious solemnity and higher meaning to public meetings, but at the same time\n\nto recognize that there remain situations that in their totality exceed what Town of Greece\n\nidentified as permissible bounds. It is the dissents’ unwillingness to identify any\n\nmeaningful limit to any sort of sectarian prayer practice in local governmental functions\n\nthat draws their fidelity to Town of Greece into serious question.\n\n                                            C.\n\n       The county, bolstered by amici, argues that there is “a long tradition of opening\n\nlegislative sessions—at all levels of government—with prayer by legislators themselves.”\n\nSupp. Br. of Appellant at 3. Members of Congress have occasionally delivered\n\ninvocations in the Senate and House of Representatives. See Br. of Amici Curiae\n\n                                            18\n\fMembers of Congress at 6. The state amici, drawing on a national survey, assert that a\n\nmajority of state legislatures allow lawmakers to offer invocations “on at least some\n\noccasions,” including seven of the ten state legislative chambers in the Fourth Circuit. Br.\n\nof Amici Curiae State of West Virginia and 12 Other States at 13-14. Many county and\n\ncity governments also permit elected officials to deliver invocations. Id. at 15. Setting\n\naside the question of whether contemporaneous practices provide compelling evidence of\n\nhistorical tradition, it is clear that lawmaker-led prayer is far from rare.\n\n       The evidence collected by Rowan County and amici, however, only reinforces our\n\nconclusion that the county’s prayer practice falls outside the tradition of legislative prayer\n\nelaborated in Marsh and Town of Greece. First, while lawmakers may occasionally lead\n\nan invocation, this phenomenon appears to be the exception to the rule, at least at the\n\nstate and federal levels. Amici members of Congress note that “Senators have, from time\n\nto time, delivered the prayer,” but that “[m]embers routinely invite guest ministers” to\n\noffer the invocation. Br. of Amici Curiae Members of Congress at 6-7 (citations omitted).\n\nThe survey cited by the state amici clarifies that “it is a tradition for a chaplain to be\n\nselected to serve the [legislative] body.” National Conference of State Legislatures,\n\nInside the Legislative Process 5-147 (2002) (hereinafter NCSL Survey). Twenty-seven\n\nstate legislative chambers designate an official chaplain. Id. Seventy-nine invite “visiting\n\nchaplains [who] usually rotate among religions.” Id. Second, Rowan County and amici\n\nelide the distinction between extending the prayer opportunity to lawmakers (as many\n\nlegislatures do) and restricting it to those lawmakers (as Rowan County did here). For the\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\freasons we discuss below, the latter approach poses greater risks under the Establishment\n\nClause.\n\n       In marshaling the historical and contemporaneous evidence of lawmaker-led\n\nprayer, Rowan County and its amici are waging war against a phantom. The plaintiffs\n\nhave never contended that the Establishment Clause prohibits legislators from giving\n\ninvocations, nor did the district court so conclude. See Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 722 n.4\n\n(“[T]he Commissioners’ provision of prayers is not per se unconstitutional. . . . Under a\n\ndifferent, inclusive prayer practice, Commissioners might be able to provide\n\nprayers . . . .”). Like the plaintiffs and the district court, we “would not for a moment cast\n\nall legislator-led prayer as constitutionally suspect.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 433 (panel\n\ndissent). Religious faith is “a source of personal guidance, strength, and comfort.” Id. at\n\n431. And legislative prayer’s “solemnizing effect for lawmakers is likely heightened\n\nwhen they personally utter the prayer.” Id. at 433. Accordingly, the Establishment Clause\n\nindeed allows lawmakers to deliver invocations in appropriate circumstances. Legislator-\n\nled prayer is not inherently unconstitutional.\n\n       We simply conclude, as the district court did, that the identity of the prayer-giver\n\nis relevant to the constitutional inquiry. Establishment Clause questions are by their\n\nnature “matter[s] of degree,” presupposing some acceptable practices and others that\n\ncross the line. Van Orden v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799990\"><a href=\"/opinion/799990/van-orden-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in\n\nthe judgment); see also Lynch, 465 U.S. at 678-79 (“In each case, the inquiry calls for\n\nline drawing; no fixed, per se rule can be framed. . . . The line between permissible\n\nrelationships and those barred by the [Establishment] Clause can no more be straight and\n\n                                             20\n\funwavering than due process can be defined in a single stroke or phrase or test.”). Prayers\n\nled by lawmakers, like sectarian prayers, may violate the Establishment Clause in some\n\ncircumstances. And just as sectarian prayer has its limits, so, too, does legislator-led\n\nprayer.\n\n       Within the universe of prayers delivered by legislators, the constitutionality of a\n\nparticular government’s approach ultimately will depend on other aspects of the prayer\n\npractice. In fact, the very survey proffered by state amici illustrates the importance of\n\nviewing lawmaker-led prayer in context. The survey recommends that the prayer-giver\n\n“be especially sensitive to expressions that may be unsuitable to members of some faiths”\n\nwhen “opening and closing the prayer.” NCSL Survey at 5-146. Because legislator-led\n\ninvocations vary so widely, “[w]e cannot discern from the general survey proffered by\n\namici which prayers were primarily for the benefit of legislators or commissioners as in\n\nTown of Greece and which focused, as the prayers did here, on requesting the citizens at\n\nthe meeting to pray.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 433 (panel dissent). “Nor do we know from the\n\nsurvey what percentage of prayers given by elected officials generally contain sectarian\n\nreferences or proselytizing exhortations, or which are non-denominational or delivered by\n\nlegislators of diverse faiths.” Id.\n\n       In sum, the elected members of Rowan County’s Board of Commissioners\n\ncomposed and delivered their own sectarian prayers featuring but a single faith. They\n\nprevented anyone else from offering invocations. The Board’s prayer practice thus pushes\n\nthis case well outside the confines of Town of Greece and indeed outside the realm of\n\nlawmaker-led prayer itself. To see just how far outside those boundaries the prayer\n\n                                            21\n\fpractice was, we must turn to the operation of the practice itself. Because Town of Greece\n\ndoes not resolve this challenge, we must decide whether the county’s prayer practice,\n\ntaken as a whole, exceeded constitutional limits on legislative prayer.\n\n                                             III.\n\n       “[W]hen a seat of government begins to resemble a house of worship, the values\n\nof religious observance are put at risk, and the danger of religious division rises\n\naccordingly.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 431 (panel dissent). That is why “[t]he clearest command\n\nof the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially\n\npreferred over another.” Larson v. Valente, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110697\"><a href=\"/opinion/110697/larson-v-valente/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244 (1982). Rowan County’s\n\nprayer practice violated this maxim by so clearly identifying the government with a\n\nparticular faith.\n\n       Courts adjudicating a challenge to legislative prayer inquire “into the prayer\n\nopportunity as a whole, rather than into the contents of a single prayer.” Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1824. They must conduct a “fact-sensitive” review of “the setting in which\n\nthe prayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed,” id. at 1825 (plurality opinion),\n\nas well as “the pattern of prayers over time,” id. at 1827.\n\n       As the exclusive prayer-givers, Rowan County’s elected representatives—the very\n\nembodiment of the state—delivered sectarian invocations referencing one and only one\n\nreligion. They asked their constituents to join them in worship. They did so at every\n\nmeeting of a local governing body for many years. We examine each of these features in\n\nturn: commissioners as the sole prayer-givers; invocations that drew exclusively on\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\fChristianity and sometimes served to advance that faith; invitations to attendees to\n\nparticipate; and the local government setting.\n\n       To respect the Supreme Court’s insistence on a fact-sensitive inquiry, we must\n\nalso pay close attention to the interplay between the various facets of the county’s prayer\n\npractice. As previously noted, the invocations here were written and given by elected\n\nrepresentatives acting in their official capacity. This fact interacts with the other aspects\n\nof the county’s practice, altering their constitutional significance. Accordingly, we must\n\nevaluate these other elements through the lens of the prayer-giver’s identity. We conclude\n\nthat it is the combination of these elements—not any particular feature alone—that\n\n“threatens to blur the line between church and state to a degree unimaginable in Town of\n\nGreece.” Lund, 837 F. 3d at 435 (panel dissent).\n\n                                             A.\n\n       “It is a cornerstone principle of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence that ‘it is\n\nno part of the business of government to compose official prayers . . . .’” Lee, 505 U.S. at\n\n588 (quoting Engel v. Vitale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106443\"><a href=\"/opinion/106443/engel-v-vitale/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425 (1962)). The government “is without\n\npower to prescribe . . . any particular form of prayer which is to be used as an official\n\nprayer in carrying on any program of governmentally sponsored religious activity.”\n\nEngel, 370 U.S. at 430. The Court reiterated this foundational point in Town of Greece:\n\n“Our Government is prohibited from prescribing prayers to be recited in our public\n\ninstitutions in order to promote a preferred system of belief or code of moral behavior.”\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1822.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f       But that is precisely what happened in Rowan County, where the five\n\ncommissioners “maintain[ed] exclusive and complete control over the content of the\n\nprayers.” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 733. In Marsh, the prayer-giver was paid by the state.\n\nIn Town of Greece, the prayer-giver was invited by the state. But in Rowan County, the\n\nprayer-giver was the state itself. The Board was thus “elbow-deep in the activities banned\n\nby the Establishment Clause—selecting and prescribing sectarian prayers.” Lund, 837\n\nF.3d at 434 (panel dissent).\n\n       By arrogating the prayer opportunity to itself, the Board also restricted the number\n\nof faiths that could be referenced at its meetings. When guests are allowed to deliver\n\ninvocations, as in Marsh and Town of Greece, legislators can easily expand the religions\n\nrepresented (perhaps in response to requests or on their own initiative). In upholding\n\nsectarian prayer, Town of Greece emphasized that legislatures are typically able and\n\nwilling to accommodate diverse faiths. The way to acknowledge “our growing diversity,”\n\nthe Court suggested, is “not by proscribing sectarian content but by welcoming ministers\n\nof many creeds.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1820-21 (citing congressional prayers\n\nreferencing Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism).\n\n       Compare the county’s rigid, restrictive practice with the more flexible, inclusive\n\napproach upheld in Town of Greece. Greece welcomed adherents of all faiths, allowing\n\n“any member of the public [the chance] to offer an invocation reflecting his or her own\n\nconvictions.” Id. at 1826 (plurality opinion). Most of the guest ministers were Christian,\n\nowing to the fact that “nearly all of the congregations in town turned out to be Christian.”\n\nId. at 1824 (majority opinion). To address complaints, however, the town “invited a\n\n                                            24\n\fJewish layman and the chairman of the local Baha’i temple to deliver prayers” and\n\ngranted a Wiccan priestess’s request to participate. Id. at 1817. By opening its prayer\n\nopportunity to all comers, the town cultivated an atmosphere of greater tolerance and\n\ninclusion.\n\n       Rowan County regrettably sent the opposite message. Instead of embracing\n\nreligious pluralism and the possibility of a correspondingly diverse invocation practice,\n\nRowan County’s commissioners created a “closed-universe” of prayer-givers dependent\n\nsolely on election outcomes. Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 723. The commissioners\n\neffectively insulated themselves from requests to diversify prayer content. And we cannot\n\noverlook the fact that the decision to restrict the prayer opportunity to the commissioners\n\nwas not made by the citizens of Rowan County or some disinterested group but\n\nperpetuated by the commissioners themselves—all of whom identify as Protestant\n\nChristian. See J.A. 275 (United Methodist); J.A. 287 (same); J.A. 279 (Independent\n\nBaptist); J.A. 291 (same); J.A. 283 (Southern Baptist).\n\n       For any Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, or others who sought some\n\nmodest place for their own faith or at least some less insistent invocation of the majority\n\nfaith, the only recourse available was to elect a commissioner with similar religious\n\nviews. See Br. of Appellant at 26. We find this point troubling. “[V]oters may wonder\n\nwhat kind of prayer a candidate of a minority religious persuasion would select if elected.\n\nFailure to pray in the name of the prevailing faith risks becoming a campaign issue or a\n\ntacit political debit, which in turn deters those of minority faiths from seeking office.”\n\nLund, 837 F.3d at 435 (panel dissent). Further, allowing the county to restrict to one the\n\n                                            25\n\fnumber of faiths represented at Board meetings would warp our inclusive tradition of\n\nlegislative prayer into a zero-sum game of competing religious factions. Our Constitution\n\nsafeguards religious pluralism; it does not sanction activity which would take us “one\n\nstep closer to a de facto religious litmus test for public office.” Id.\n\n       Finally, we note that the risk of political division stemming from prayer practice\n\nconflict is no mere abstract matter. At one meeting, an individual who “expressed\n\nopposition to the Board’s prayer practice” was booed and jeered by the audience. Lund,\n\n103 F. Supp. 3d at 729. In addition, the prayer practice became a campaign issue in the\n\n2016 Board elections. The two incumbent commissioners favored continuing the\n\ncounty’s defense of the prayer practice, while two challengers opposed it. See Supp. Br.\n\nof Appellees at 16 n.6. The incumbents ultimately prevailed. Id. Almost four decades\n\nago, the Supreme Court cautioned that “political division along religious lines . . . is a\n\nthreat to the normal political process,” and is therefore “one of the principal evils against\n\nwhich the First Amendment was intended to protect.” Lemon, 403 U.S. at 622. Time has\n\ndone nothing to diminish the salience of this warning.\n\n                                               B.\n\n       Having structured the prayer opportunity so that Board members alone could give\n\nvoice to their religious convictions, the commissioners unceasingly and exclusively\n\ninvoked Christianity. Even more problematic, the prayer practice at times “promote[d]”\n\nChristianity, the commissioners’ “preferred system of belief.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct.\n\nat 1822.\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\f       Rowan County makes the entirely fair point that courts must not become censors\n\nof public prayer. The Supreme Court echoed this concern, warning courts away from\n\nbecoming “supervisors and censors of religious speech.” Id. A single prayer will thus not\n\n“despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and embraces our tradition” of legislative\n\nprayer. Id. at 1824. At the same time, however, courts must decide the case before them,\n\nwhich cannot be done without “review[ing] the pattern of prayers over time.” Id. at 1826-\n\n27 (plurality opinion). Where even the most cursory look reveals a constitutionally\n\nproblematic prayer practice, courts have no choice but to examine the entire record,\n\nwhich of course includes the invocations. A proper sensitivity toward the dangers of\n\njudicial overreach in this area cannot divest us of a duty which if not performed would\n\ngrant free rein to governmental sectarian abuse.\n\n       The lead dissent decries this inquiry as “judicial review run amok.” 3 Infra Lead\n\nDissent at 98. But while judicial review of prayer practices might indeed pose a danger in\n\nsome instances, there is no danger here. Every single individual in Rowan County\n\nremains free to pray as he or she sees fit and in the individual or collective setting that he\n\nor she finds most meaningful. What government is not free to do, however, is link itself\n\npersistently and relentlessly to a single faith. See Larson, 456 U.S. at 244 (“The clearest\n\ncommand of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be\n\nofficially preferred over another.”). This evident an identification of the state with one\n\nand only one faith is not, we repeat, some marginal or peripheral constitutional violation\n\n\n       3\n           The lead dissent refers to Judge Agee’s dissent.\n\n                                              27\n\fthat we can just shrug off and wish away. For to do so here would wish away the\n\nEstablishment Clause itself. The overwhelming majority of the Board’s invocations\n\nreferenced tenets of Christianity. Over a period of more than five years, only 4 of 143\n\nprayers were non-sectarian. Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 714. The remaining 139 prayers, or\n\n97%, “use[d] ideas or images identified with [Christianity],” Lee, 505 U.S. at 588, such\n\nas “Jesus,” “Christ,” or the “Savior,” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 714. No other religion was\n\never represented in the invocations. Id. Sectarian references were especially common at\n\nthe conclusion of the prayer. To list but a few representative examples: “I ask this in the\n\nname of the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ,” S.A. 33 (prayer of March 5,\n\n2012); “[I] ask these things in the name of Jesus and for the sake of His Kingdom,” S.A.\n\n15 (prayer of June 2, 2008); “For the sake of your Son, our Savior, the Lord Jesus\n\nChrist,” S.A. 31 (prayer of October 3, 2011); and “In Jesus’ name we pray,” S.A. 22\n\n(prayer of November 16, 2009). Several invocations delved into the finer points of\n\nChristian theology. One prayer during the holiday season began, “[W]e’d like to thank\n\nyou for the Virgin Birth, we’d like to thank you for the Cross at Calvary, and we’d like to\n\nthank you for the resurrection.” S.A. 12 (prayer of December 3, 2007). Another\n\nremarked, “Father God, . . . [w]e thank you so much for sending your Son Jesus Christ to\n\nthis world, and we always remember that this time of year, Lord, and we should\n\nremember it always.” S.A. 27 (prayer of December 6, 2010).\n\n       Town of Greece instructs courts to consider a prayer practice from the perspective\n\nof the “reasonable observer,” who is presumed to be “acquainted with [the] tradition” of\n\nlegislative prayer. 134 S. Ct. at 1825 (plurality opinion). Although “adult citizens, firm in\n\n                                             28\n\ftheir own beliefs, can tolerate and perhaps appreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a\n\nperson of a different faith,” id. at 1823 (majority opinion), the “reasonable observer”—or\n\neven the exceptionally well-informed citizen steeped in the Court’s legislative prayer\n\njurisprudence—would be surprised to find exclusively sectarian invocations being\n\ndelivered exclusively by the commissioners because, as noted, the Court has consistently\n\nspoken in terms of guest ministers and outside volunteers.\n\n       In addition, as noted, no religion other than Christianity was ever represented at\n\nBoard meetings. “When the state’s representatives so emphatically evoke a single\n\nreligion in nearly every prayer over a period of many years, that faith comes to be\n\nperceived as the one true faith, not merely of individual prayer-givers, but of government\n\nitself.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 434 (panel dissent). Faced with this unchanging tableau,\n\nattendees must have come to the inescapable conclusion that the Board “favors one faith\n\nand one faith only.” Id. at 435. This was the inference drawn by the plaintiffs, who\n\ndescribed their sense of separation from their own government and the political process\n\nitself. See S.A. 1-10 (affidavits of the plaintiffs).\n\n       It is not necessary, of course, for governments to go out of their way “to achieve\n\nreligious balancing” in prayer content or to represent some minimum number of faiths.\n\nTown of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824. But in considering whether government has aligned\n\nitself with a particular religion, a tapestry of many faiths lessens that risk whereas\n\ninvoking only one exacerbates it. Here, the Board’s practice created the perception that\n\nRowan County had taken sides on questions of faith.\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\f       Not only did the Board’s invocations convey its singular approval of Christianity,\n\nthe prayer opportunity on occasion served to advance that faith. The tradition of\n\nlegislative prayer elaborated in Town of Greece was composed of prayers that “reflect\n\nupon shared ideals and common ends” and that “strive for the idea that people of many\n\nfaiths may be united in a community of tolerance and devotion,” using sectarian\n\n“religious themes [as] particular means to [these] universal ends.” Id. at 1823. In contrast,\n\nthe Establishment Clause does not condone a prayer practice that “over time is . . .\n\n‘exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.’”\n\nId. (quoting Marsh, 463 U.S. at 794-95).\n\n       On multiple occasions, the invocations crossed the line from “reflect[ing] upon\n\nshared ideals and common ends,” id. at 1823, to “promot[ing] a preferred system of\n\nbelief,” id. at 1822. To begin, several prayers purported to confess spiritual shortcomings\n\non the community’s behalf. Consider the following examples:\n\n   • “Although you sent Jesus to be Savior of the world, we confess that we\n     treat Him as our own personal God. Although you are one, and the body of\n     Christ is one, we fail to display that unity in our worship, our mission, and\n     our fellowship.” S.A. 31 (prayer of October 3, 2011).\n\n   • “Lord, we confess that we have not loved you with all our heart, and mind\n     and strength, and that we have not loved one another as Christ loves us. We\n     have also neglected to follow the guidance of your Holy Spirit, and have\n     allowed sin to enter into our lives.” S.A. 30 (prayer of August 1, 2011).\n\n   • “God of healing mercies, we come to you this day confessing that we are an\n     imperfect people. . . . We acknowledge that we’ve been given the pathway\n     to peace, in the witness of Jesus Christ . . . . [But] oftentimes we have failed\n     to witness on Earth.” S.A. 26 (prayer of August 16, 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\fBy portraying the failure to love Jesus or follow his teachings as spiritual defects, the\n\nprayers implicitly “signal[ed] disfavor toward” non-Christians. Town of Greece, 134 S.\n\nCt. at 1826 (plurality opinion).\n\n       Multiple prayers characterized Christianity as “the one and only way to salvation,”\n\nS.A. 15 (prayer of August 18, 2008), thus implying that adherents of other faiths were in\n\nsome ways condemned. For example, one commissioner unequivocally stated that “we do\n\nbelieve that there is only one way to salvation, and that is Jesus Christ.” S.A. 12 (prayer\n\nof December 3, 2007); see also S.A. 13 (prayer of February 18, 2008) (“I ask all these\n\nthings in the name of Jesus, the one and only way to salvation.”).\n\n       The record is replete with other invocations proclaiming that Christianity is\n\nexceptional and suggesting that other faiths are inferior. This message risks\n\n“denigrat[ing] nonbelievers [and] religious minorities.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n1823. Consider the following inexhaustive survey:\n\n   • “We have been blessed to be the recipients of your immeasurable grace. We\n     can’t be defeated, we can’t be destroyed, and we can’t be denied because\n     we are going to live forever with you through the salvation of Jesus Christ. .\n     . . And as we pick up the Cross, we will proclaim His name above all\n     names, as the only way to eternal life.” S.A. 33 (prayer of March 5, 2012).\n\n   • “We can’t be defeated, we can’t be destroyed, and we won’t be denied,\n     because of our salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ.” S.A. 19 (prayer of\n     May 18, 2009).\n\n   • “You saved us and you call us with the holy calling. We are the recipients\n     of your immeasurable grace and glory. We are the richest people in the\n     world. . . . [W]e’re going to live forever with Him.” S.A. 15 (prayer of June\n     2, 2008).\n\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\f       Finally, several prayers urged attendees to embrace Christianity, thereby\n\n“preach[ing] conversion.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1823. One invocation advocated\n\nthat the community take up the Christian faith:\n\n       Father, I pray that all may be one as you, Father, are in Jesus, and He in\n       you. I pray that they may be one in you, that the world may believe that you\n       sent Jesus to save us from our sins. May we hunger and thirst for\n       righteousness, be made perfect in holiness, and be preserved, whole and\n       entire, spirit, soul, and body, irreproachable at the coming of our Lord Jesus\n       Christ.\nS.A. 21 (prayer of October 5, 2009). “Holy Spirit,” went another prayer, “open our hearts\n\nto Christ’s teachings, and enable us to spread His message amongst the people we know\n\nand love through the applying of the sacred words in our everyday lives.” S.A. 28 (prayer\n\nof March 7, 2011).\n\n       Religious faith has both doctrinal and ecumenical features. The doctrinal aspects\n\nof religion, most often expressed in religious services, signify the ideas and rituals that\n\nmake religions distinctive. Doctrine can lend strength, cohesion, comfort, and spiritual\n\ndepth to religious communities. The ecumenical aspects of faith, by contrast, draw on the\n\nbeliefs shared by many different creeds and “widely held among the people of this\n\ncountry.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 792. Central among these beliefs is faith in a higher\n\nprovidence that lends meaning and purpose to our life on earth and encourages us to\n\nembrace our common humanity and to strive for the best versions of ourselves. At its\n\nbest, legislative prayer gives voice to the ecumenical dimensions of religious faith.\n\nInvocations that, like the above examples, hone too sharply in on doctrinal distinctions,\n\nrisk “the divisiveness the Establishment Clause seeks rightly to avoid.” Simpson, 404\n\n\n                                            32\n\fF.3d at 284. Prayer that would be welcome and moving to the faithful in so many a\n\nsetting ought to in some way become welcoming to others where the powers of\n\ngovernment are implicated and persons of diverse faiths are involved.\n\n       Two serious harms arise “[w]hen the power [and] prestige . . . of government is\n\nplaced behind a particular religious belief.” Engel, 370 U.S. at 431. One is suffered by the\n\nindividual. “A state-created orthodoxy puts at grave risk that freedom of belief and\n\nconscience which are the sole assurance that religious faith is real, not imposed.” Lee,\n\n505 U.S. at 592; see Engel, 370 U.S. at 429 (“[O]ne of the greatest dangers to the\n\nfreedom of the individual to worship in his own way lay[s] in the Government’s placing\n\nits official stamp of approval upon one particular kind of prayer . . . .”). The second injury\n\nis to the government itself. A well-founded perception that a government favors citizens\n\nsubscribing to a particular faith would undermine the democratic legitimacy of its\n\nactions. See Engel, 370 U.S. at 431 (“[W]henever government had allied itself with one\n\nparticular form of religion, the inevitable result had been that it had incurred the hatred,\n\ndisrespect and even contempt of those who held contrary beliefs.”).\n\n       By proclaiming the spiritual and moral supremacy of Christianity, characterizing\n\nthe political community as a Christian one, and urging adherents of other religions to\n\nembrace Christianity as the sole path to salvation, the Board in its prayer practice stepped\n\nover the line. Concerns of this nature underlay Justice Jackson’s enduring distillation of\n\nFirst Amendment values: “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is\n\nthat no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,\n\nnationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion . . . .” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v.\n\n                                             33\n\fBarnette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103870\"><a href=\"/opinion/103870/west-virginia-bd-of-ed-v-barnette/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (1943). This is no less true when orthodoxy reflects, as it did\n\nhere, the most sincere manifestations of the most deeply held convictions.\n\n                                               C.\n\n       Before delivering their invocations, the commissioners told attendees to rise and\n\noften invited them to pray. See, e.g., S.A. 12 (prayer of November 19, 2007) (“Let’s pray\n\ntogether.”); S.A. 26 (prayer of October 4, 2010) (“Please pray with me.”); S.A. 37 (prayer\n\nof February 19, 2013) (“Let us pray.”). Through these requests and the proselytizing\n\ninvocations just discussed, the Board members “press[ed] religious observances upon\n\ntheir citizens.” Van Orden, 545 U.S. at 683.\n\n       Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion in Town of Greece advises courts to assess\n\nwhether the “principal audience” for the invocations is the lawmakers or the public. 134\n\nS. Ct. at 1825. An internally-focused prayer practice “accommodate[s] the spiritual needs\n\nof lawmakers,” id. at 1826, while an externally-oriented one attempts “to promote\n\nreligious observance among the public,” id. at 1825.\n\n       The invitations here fall “within the realm of soliciting, asking, requesting, or\n\ndirecting . . . of concern to the Town of Greece plurality.” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 728.\n\nThe lead dissent insists that the Rowan County “legislators themselves [were] the\n\nintended ‘congregation’ for legislative prayer.” Infra Lead Dissent at 87. But the record\n\nmakes clear that the commissioners were seeking audience involvement, not merely\n\naddressing fellow legislators. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine more probative evidence of\n\na government’s concern for the community’s religiosity than a legislator’s request that\n\ncitizens join him in prayers that, for instance, ask “the world [to] believe that [God] sent\n\n                                               34\n\fJesus to save us from our sins.” S.A. 21 (prayer of October 5, 2009). Because the\n\ninvocations here placed Christianity on a higher plane than other faiths and urged\n\nattendees to embrace that religion, the requests to participate in those prayers are clear\n\nindicators of an effort “to promote religious observance among the public.” Town of\n\nGreece, 134 S. Ct. at 1825 (plurality opinion).\n\n       Town of Greece involved similar requests, but the prayers in that case did not\n\napproach the degree of proselytization here and—even more important—the invitations\n\n“came not from town leaders but from the guest ministers, who presumably are\n\naccustomed to directing their congregations in this way.” Id. at 1826. Justice Kennedy\n\nunderscored that “[a]lthough board members themselves stood [or] bowed their heads,”\n\nthey “at no point solicited similar gestures by the public.” Id.\n\n       From the perspective of the reasonable observer, this distinction matters. Such an\n\nobserver is aware that phrases like “Let us pray” may be “for many clergy . . . almost\n\nreflexive.” Id. at 1832 (Alito, J., concurring). But when these words are uttered by elected\n\nrepresentatives acting in their official capacity, they become a request on behalf of the\n\nstate. The invitations suggest that the lawmaker conceives of the political community as\n\ncomprised of people who pray as he or she does.\n\n       The Town of Greece plurality expressly cautioned that “[t]he analysis would be\n\ndifferent if town board members directed the public to participate in the prayers.” Id. at\n\n1826 (emphasis added). Yet Rowan County would have us approve such requests\n\nregardless of their source. See Supp. Br. of Appellant at 7 (“The Supreme Court saw no\n\nconflict between these introductions and the Establishment Clause.”). Accepting this\n\n                                             35\n\fargument would require us to blind ourselves to the very fact that the Town of Greece\n\nplurality regarded as relevant and perhaps even dispositive. In the end, the record speaks\n\nfor itself: elected officials exhorted their constituents to participate in sectarian—and\n\nsometimes even proselytizing—religious exercises.\n\n                                             D.\n\n       Justice Kennedy’s plurality opinion in Town of Greece instructs courts to consider\n\n“the setting in which the prayer arises.” 134 S. Ct. at 1825. The prayers here were\n\ndelivered at the public meetings of a local government body, a fact that makes the other\n\naspects of the county’s prayer practice even more questionable.\n\n       Relative to sessions of Congress and state legislatures, the intimate setting of a\n\nmunicipal board meeting presents a heightened potential for coercion. Local governments\n\npossess the power to directly influence both individual and community interests. As a\n\nresult, citizens attend meetings to petition for valuable rights and benefits, to advocate on\n\nbehalf of cherished causes, and to keep tabs on their elected representatives—in short, to\n\nparticipate in democracy. The decision to attend local government meetings may not be\n\nwholly voluntary in the same way as the choice to participate in other civic or community\n\nfunctions. Going to one’s seat of government and going to one’s place of worship are\n\n“very different forms of attendance.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 437 (panel dissent).\n\n       In addition, the commissioners considered citizen petitions shortly after the\n\ninvocation. Like other local governments, the Board exercises both legislative authority\n\nover questions of general public importance as well as a quasi-adjudicatory power over\n\nsuch granular issues as zoning petitions, permit applications, and contract awards. In\n\n                                             36\n\fTown of Greece, the board apparently bifurcated its meetings into legislative and\n\nadjudicative portions. See 134 S. Ct. at 1829 (Alito, J., concurring). As Justice Alito\n\nexplained in his concurrence, the prayer “preceded only the portion of the town board\n\nmeeting that [was] essentially legislative.” Id. Accordingly, the case did not “involve the\n\nconstitutionality of a prayer prior to what may be characterized as an adjudicatory\n\nproceeding.” Id.\n\n       In the parlance of Justice Alito’s concurrence, Rowan County’s Board\n\nintermingled its legislative and adjudicative business. On numerous occasions,\n\nadjudicatory proceedings were the first items up for consideration after the standard\n\nopening protocols. See, e.g., J.A. 27 (agenda of November 5, 2007) (“Quasi-Judicial\n\nPublic Hearing for PCUR 02-07 for Request by Nelson Lingle”); J.A. 105 (agenda of\n\nAugust 17, 2009) (“Quasi-Judicial Hearing for CUP 01-09 for Albert Ray Kepley”); J.A.\n\n163 (agenda of February 21, 2011) (“Quasi-Judicial Hearing for SUP 01-11”).\n\n       The “close proximity” between a board’s sectarian exercises and its consideration\n\nof specific individual petitions “presents, to say the least, the opportunity for abuse.”\n\nLund, 837 F.3d at 436 (panel dissent). The plurality in Town of Greece recognized as\n\nmuch in advising courts to consider whether “town board members directed the public to\n\nparticipate in the prayers.” 134 S. Ct. at 1826. This is not to suggest that the\n\ncommissioners made decisions based on whether an attendee participated in the prayers.\n\nBut the fact remains that the Board considered individual petitions on the heels of the\n\ncommissioners’ prayers.\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\f       Finally, the intimacy of a town board meeting may push attendees to participate in\n\nthe prayer practice in order to avoid the community’s disapproval. This is especially true\n\nwhere, as here, the government has aligned itself with the faith that dominates the\n\nelectorate. Rowan County’s commissioners always stood up and bowed their heads, as\n\ndid most of the audience. Due to the Board’s requests, the plaintiffs also felt compelled to\n\nstand so that they would not stand out. And as we noted, one person who spoke out\n\nagainst the Board’s prayer practice was booed and jeered by her fellow citizens.\n\n       To be sure, citizens could time their arrival at the meeting to come after the prayer,\n\nleave the room before the prayer, or simply stay seated. But these options, such as they\n\nwere, served only to marginalize. It is simply wrong to attribute discomfort with the\n\nsituation here to hyper-sensitivity. Plaintiffs were placed in a situation that required them\n\nto decide “between staying seated and unobservant, or acquiescing to the prayer\n\npractice.” Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 732. What was forced upon plaintiffs at these\n\nmeetings was “no trivial choice, involving, as it does, the pressures of civic life and the\n\nintimate precincts of the spirit.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 437 (panel dissent).\n\n       There remains the question of what prayer practice in Rowan County would be a\n\npermissible one. We decline, however, to select one from among the various options\n\navailable to defendant. Any future course of action is, and certainly would be in the first\n\ninstance, for Rowan County to decide. The problematic features of the present practice\n\nnoted in our decision should provide substantial guidance for whatever future steps the\n\ncounty may wish to take. The ultimate criterion is simply one of conveying a message of\n\nrespect and welcome for persons of all beliefs and adopting a prayer practice that\n\n                                             38\n\fadvances “the core idea behind legislative prayer, ‘that people of many faiths may be\n\nunited in a community of tolerance and devotion.’” Id. at 438 (quoting Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1823).\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       We finally find unavailing the two primary arguments advanced in Rowan\n\nCounty’s favor. To begin, the county urges this court to conduct a blinkered review of its\n\nprayer practice. The county first reduces the practice to its constituent elements, then\n\nfinds that each element is not dispositive, and finally concludes that each element is\n\ntherefore immaterial. See, e.g., Supp. Br. of Appellant at 9 (“[F]our rights do not make a\n\nwrong. . . . [E]ach feature enumerated by plaintiffs is common to prayer practices\n\nobserved in [other] legislatures . . . .”).\n\n       But when a court looks to the totality of the circumstances to assess the\n\nconstitutionality of a prayer practice, as the Supreme Court says we must, a fact may be\n\nrelevant to the court’s inquiry while not outcome-determinative. And by dissecting the\n\nprayer practice and subjecting each piece to an independent constitutional evaluation, the\n\ncounty’s approach overlooks the crucial interaction between the elements. This mode of\n\nanalysis simply fails to heed the Supreme Court’s instruction that we examine “the prayer\n\nopportunity as a whole.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824.\n\n       The dissents do not even begin to consider the prayer practice here holistically.\n\nThey address it piece by piece by piece. Unsurprisingly, they find each piece “standing\n\nalone [is] undoubtedly constitutional.” Infra Lead Dissent at 76. Be that as it may, the\n\ncitizens of Rowan County are not experiencing the prayer practice piece by piece by\n\n                                              39\n\fpiece. It comes at them whole. It would seem elementary that a thing may be innocuous\n\nin isolation and impermissible in combination. In fact, the lead dissent’s tired “divide and\n\nconquer” strategy has been frowned upon by the Supreme Court itself. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Arvizu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118474\"><a href=\"/opinion/118474/united-states-v-arvizu/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274 (2002) (“The court's evaluation and rejection of seven\n\nof the listed factors in isolation from each other does not take into account the ‘totality of\n\nthe circumstances,’ as our cases have understood that phrase. . . . [Precedent] precludes\n\nthis sort of divide-and-conquer analysis.”).\n\n       Second, we cannot discern any meaningful distinction between the commissioners\n\nand the Board. The lead dissent argues that “[t]here is no evidence that the Board, as a\n\nBoard, had any role in any of the prayers given by any of the individual commissioners,”\n\nwho are “free agent[s] no different from the ministers in Town of Greece or the paid\n\nchaplain in Marsh.” Infra Lead Dissent at 88. On this view, “it is only through [the] act of\n\nthe deliberative body writing or editing religious speech that government would\n\nimpermissibly seek ‘to promote a preferred system of belief or code of moral behavior’\n\nwith selected content.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 421. (quoting Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n1822). This reasoning proves too much. Such an approach would create a constitutional\n\nsafe harbor for all prayers delivered by legislators “no matter how proselytizing,\n\ndisparaging of other faiths, or coercive” so long as the legislature itself did not\n\ncollectively compose the prayers. Supp. Br. of Appellees at 13-14 n.5.\n\n       Further, the attempted distinction between the members of the Board and the\n\nBoard itself rests on a formalism that cannot withstand scrutiny. When one of Rowan\n\nCounty’s commissioners leads his constituents in prayer, he is not just another private\n\n                                               40\n\fcitizen. He is the representative of the state, and he gives the invocation in his official\n\ncapacity as a commissioner. His power to offer a prayer derives from this status; were he\n\nnot a member of the Board, he would be barred from doing so. The commissioners\n\nthemselves recognized as much. Invoking a recurrent theme in the prayer practice, one\n\nBoard member observed: “[W]e’re not here representing ourselves. Lord, we represent\n\nyou and we represent the taxpayers of Rowan County.” S.A. 16 (prayer of October 6,\n\n2008). And unlike a guest minister, the commissioner remains on the scene to participate\n\nin the Board’s decision-making. Finally, “it is hard to believe that a practice observed so\n\nuniformly over so many years was not by any practical yardstick reflective of board\n\npolicy.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 434 (panel dissent). In the context of Rowan County’s prayer\n\npractice, there is no daylight between the individual commissioners and the Board of\n\nCommissioners.\n\n                                            V.\n\n       The principle at stake here may be a profound one, but it is also simple. The\n\nEstablishment Clause does not permit a seat of government to wrap itself in a single faith.\n\nBut here elected officials took up a ministerial function and led the political community\n\nin prayers that communicated exclusivity, leaving members of minority faiths unwilling\n\nparticipants or discomforted observers to the sectarian exercises of a religion to which\n\nthey did not subscribe. The solemn invocation of a single faith in so many meetings over\n\nso many years distanced adherents of other faiths from that representative government\n\nwhich affects the lives of all citizens and which Americans of every spiritual persuasion\n\nhave every right to call their own.\n\n                                            41\n\f       If the prayer practice here were to pass constitutional muster, we would be hard-\n\npressed to identify any constitutional limitations on legislative prayer. In arguing that the\n\nEstablishment Clause would still retain vitality, the lead dissent writes that the Board\n\nmembers would still not be permitted to offer “prayers that implored the audience to\n\nattend a particular church” or to issue “official decisions based on whether a member of\n\nthe public participated in, or voiced opposition to, the legislative prayer practice.” Infra\n\nLead Dissent at 98-99. Well of course such things would be wholly out of bounds. In\n\nsetting such criteria however, the dissent unwittingly reveals it recognizes few realistic\n\nlimits on public sectarian practice at all.\n\n       We recognize that dissents by their nature attempt to broaden majority opinions\n\nand portray them as doomsday propositions. But these dissents go well beyond even that.\n\nThe lead dissent writes that the majority restricts all lawmakers to “only a generic prayer\n\nto a generic god.” Infra Lead Dissent at 108. That assertion is incorrect. Any reading of\n\nthe majority opinion reveals it as a straw man. This case involves one specific practice in\n\none specific setting with one specific history and one specific confluence of\n\ncircumstances. To extract global significance from such specificity is beyond a stretch.\n\n       In concluding that Rowan County’s prayer practice is constitutionally infirm, we\n\nreiterate that legislator-led prayer can operate meaningfully within constitutional bounds.\n\nAnd “[n]othing about the constitutional drawbacks of Rowan County’s prayer practice\n\nshould be construed as disparaging the prayers themselves, which were moving and\n\nbeautiful on many levels.” Lund, 837 F.3d at 436 (panel dissent). But ruling in the\n\ncounty’s favor would send us down a rancorous road. It would bear “unfortunate\n\n                                              42\n\fconsequences for American pluralism, for a nation whose very penny envisions one out\n\nof many, a nation whose surpassing orthodoxy belongs in its constitutional respect for all\n\nbeliefs and faiths, a nation which enshrined in the First and Fourteenth Amendments the\n\nconviction that diversity in all of its dimensions is our abiding strength.” Id. at 432.\n\n       A final word as to our two friends and valued colleagues in dissent. Judge\n\nNiemeyer’s dissent seeks to characterize the majority opinion as anti-religious. See infra\n\nNiemeyer Dissent at 54 (“[T]he majority opinion’s reasoning strikes at the very trunk of\n\nreligion. . . .”); id. at 55 (“The majority’s most basic error is its underlying assumption\n\nthat the Establishment Clause is an anti-religion clause. . . .”). This suggestion may be\n\neasily dismissed. To reject the establishment of a single religious faith by the state is not\n\nto reject religion itself. See Engel v. Vitale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106443\"><a href=\"/opinion/106443/engel-v-vitale/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435 (1962) (“It is neither\n\nsacrilegious nor antireligious to say that each separate government in this country should\n\nstay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers and leave that purely\n\nreligious function to the people themselves and to those the people choose to look to for\n\nreligious guidance.”). The Founders were able to distinguish between the importance of\n\nreligion (the Free Exercise Clause) and the establishment of religion in a way that Judge\n\nNiemeyer refuses to do. 4\n\n       The lead dissent, meanwhile, disparages the majority for its belief in an\n\n“ecumenical utopia” and its respect for the pluralistic nature of religious faith in our\n\n\n       4\n         We do note that our colleague has flatly mischaracterized the majority opinion.\nNowhere does it say or hold that “Rowan County’s prayer practice [is] unconstitutional,\nessentially because the prayers were sectarian.” Infra Niemeyer Dissent at 54.\n\n                                              43\n\fcountry.

If that be our sin, we shall gladly confess it.\n\nLocalities enjoy wide discretion in designing a prayer practice, but those that do aspire to\n\nan ecumenical and pluralistic prayer opportunity should not have to suffer the scarcely\n\nconcealed aspersions of “ecumenical utopias” and “generic gods” that some may cast\n\nupon them. In its eager acceptance of state-entwined religious orthodoxy, the lead dissent\n\nevokes an America that is not ours and never has been. It was in simple recognition of\n\nreligious pluralism that the Founders adopted the Establishment Clause. See James\n\nMadison, Speech at the Virginia Ratifying Convention (June 12, 1788), in 11 The Papers\n\nof James Madison 130 (Robert Rutland et al. eds., 1977) (“[The] freedom [of religion]\n\narises from that multiplicity of sects, which pervades America, and which is the best and\n\nonly security for religious liberty in any society.”). Had America been a monolithic\n\nreligious entity, there would have been no need for the protection of religious diversity at\n\nall. Any thought that ecumenism and respect for religious pluralism would become\n\ndisfavored in judicial quarters would have left the Founders saddened at what their First\n\nAmendment had become.\n\n       Our Constitution seeks to preserve religious liberty without courting religious\n\nanimosity. In this quest, our two religion clauses have been a great success, helping to\n\nspare Americans the depth of religious strife that so many societies have had to suffer and\n\nendure. And yet free religious exercise can only remain free if not influenced and\n\ndirected by the hand of the state. On this score, the county simply went too far.

See Town of\n\nGreece, 134 S. Ct. at 1823; Marsh, 463 U.S. at 794–95. This rule derives from “[t]he\n\nclearest command of the Establishment Clause,” namely, “that one religious\n\ndenomination cannot be officially preferred over another.” Larson v. Valente, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110697\"><a href=\"/opinion/110697/larson-v-valente/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244 (1982). The most obvious way to show a preference for one religion is publicly\n\nto profess faith in its teachings. The Constitution fiercely protects this type of expression\n\nby individual citizens. But for the government, the Constitution absolutely forbids it.\n\nSee, e.g., Epperson v. Arkansas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107793\"><a href=\"/opinion/107793/epperson-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103–04 (1968).\n\n          This remains the law, and neither Marsh nor Town of Greece exempts prayer made\n\nbefore a legislative body from this rule. Rather, those cases simply hold that a legislative\n\nbody may participate in some limited forms of religious activity without officially taking\n\nsides or appearing to do so.\n\n          In Marsh, the Supreme Court concluded that the Nebraska Legislature did not\n\nabandon official neutrality by employing a chaplain of one particular religious\n\n                                               46\n\fdenomination to invoke divine guidance before a legislative session. See 463 U.S. at\n\n793–95. In so holding, the Court rightly deferred to the Framers’ judgment about this\n\ntype of government involvement with religion. See id. at 790–91. However, the Marsh\n\nCourt plainly did not abandon or make an exception to the Establishment Clause’s basic\n\ncommitment to neutrality.        Instead, the Court ultimately approved the Legislature’s\n\npractice because it found “no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to\n\nproselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.” Id. at 794–95.\n\n       In Town of Greece, the Court held that a legislative body’s chaplain-led prayer\n\ncould include sectarian content. 134 S. Ct. at 1823. Thus, the town board in that case did\n\nnot impermissibly prefer one religion over another simply because volunteer chaplains\n\nspoke in a particular religious idiom. To hold otherwise, the Court reasoned, would\n\nrequire legislatures and courts to “act as supervisors and censors of religious speech,”\n\nwhich would entangle government with religion far more than a rule allowing a prayer-\n\ngiver to draw on his private religious beliefs. Id. at 1822. Reviewing the town’s practice\n\nas a whole, the Court concluded that no other features of the town’s rotating system of\n\nvolunteer chaplains, all recruited in a non-discriminatory manner from local\n\ncongregations, advanced one religion to the exclusion of others. See id. at 1824.\n\n       Thus, Marsh and Town of Greece provide a guidepost for resolving the case at\n\nhand. If the Board’s practice sends the message that it prefers or accepts the teachings of\n\none religion over others, it violates the Constitution. If the practice simply allows a\n\nprayer-giver to espouse his own private religious beliefs when helping to solemnize the\n\nBoard’s meetings, it does not.\n\n                                             47\n\f       Of course, resolving whether a given practice violates the Establishment Clause\n\nrequires us to engage in a sensitive “interpretation of social facts.” Santa Fe Indep.

Yet some clear boundaries exist. For example,\n\nneither Marsh, nor Town of Greece, nor any other case suggests that a legislative body\n\nmay begin each and every one of its meetings by reciting a particular religion’s creed. It\n\ndoes not matter whether that creed is the Shahada of Islam, the Triple Gem of Buddhism,\n\na recitation from the Vedas or other shruti sacred to Hinduism, the Wiccan Rede, the\n\nShema Yisrael of Judaism — or the Apostle’s Creed of Christianity.\n\n       If members of a legislative body recited one religion’s creed month after month,\n\nyear after year, allowing no opportunity for members of any other religion to lead a\n\nprayer, a reasonable observer could only conclude that the legislative body preferred that\n\nreligion over all others. See Engel v. Vitale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106443\"><a href=\"/opinion/106443/engel-v-vitale/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430 (1962) (“There can be no\n\ndoubt that New York’s state prayer program officially establishes the religious beliefs\n\nembodied in the Regents’ prayer,” even though the prayers were optional for students.).\n\nIf a practice like this does not violate the Establishment Clause, nothing would prevent\n\nthat legislature from passing a statute, ordinance, or resolution declaring a particular faith\n\nthe true religion.     No principled distinction exists between a legislative body’s\n\nproclaiming, for example, Christianity’s status as the one true religion in a written\n\ninstrument and professing that it is so — over and over again with no room for an\n\nalternative viewpoint — during public meetings. Both constitute state action. See Turner\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\fv.

The undisputed record evidence\n\nrenders untenable Rowan County’s contention that the Commissioners were simply\n\nespousing their own personal religious beliefs. In over five years, the Board made no\n\ndisclaimers and adopted no official policies to that effect.      Moreover, the prayers\n\nthemselves were typically phrased using first-person plural pronouns like “we” and\n\n“our,” undermining any suggestion that the prayers were simply personal petitions. Nor\n\nis the conclusion Rowan County would have us draw apparent from the overall context of\n\nthe prayers. In sum, nothing about the Board’s practice would lead a reasonable observer\n\nto conclude that the Commissioners spoke only as individuals, rather than speaking for\n\nthe legislative body representing the people of Rowan County. Cf. Joyner v. Forsyth\n\nCty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"222165\"><a href=\"/opinion/222165/joyner-v-forsyth-county-nc/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 344 (4th Cir. 2011) (noting the board’s formal written policy that its\n\nprayers were “not intended . . . to affiliate the Board with, nor express the Board’s\n\npreference for, any faith or religious denomination”).\n\n       Given the Commissioners’ role in the prayer practice, the exclusivity of those\n\nprayers, the uniformity of the Christian message found in nearly every prayer, the\n\nfrequency of these sectarian prayers, the degree of sectarian content in the prayers, the\n\nlong duration of the prayer practice, and the reactions to the objections of non-Christian\n\nresidents, a reasonable observer would conclude that the Board had placed its imprimatur\n\non Christianity. In fact, a reasonable observer could not conclude otherwise.\n\n                                            49\n\f                                            II.\n\n       Nor can the historical practice of the First Congress save the Board’s practice. Of\n\ncourse, to the extent we can discern it, the Framers’ understanding of what constitutes\n\npermissible religious activity by the government serves as highly probative evidence of\n\nwhat the Establishment Clause allows and what it forbids. See Marsh, 463 U.S. at 790–\n\n91. Courts consider the Framers’ understanding probative because they drafted the First\n\nAmendment and sent it on to the states for ratification. As such, it is unlikely that the\n\nEstablishment Clause forbids a practice the First Congress engaged in or permits a\n\npractice it eschewed. For this very reason, the Marsh Court found it significant that the\n\nFirst Congress employed chaplains to deliver opening prayers, explaining that “[i]t can\n\nhardly be thought” the Framers “intended the Establishment Clause of the Amendment to\n\nforbid what they had just declared acceptable.” Id. at 790.\n\n       Study of the practice of the First Congress thus serves as a useful interpretive tool\n\nin legislative prayer cases, but this tool can easily be misused. One way to misuse it is to\n\nclaim that a practice dating back to the First Congress justifies a significantly different\n\nmodern practice. That is precisely what Rowan County and its supporting amici attempt\n\nto do here. They shoehorn the legislator-led prayer at issue in this case into the tradition\n\nbegun by the First Congress. But examination of the practice of the First Congress shows\n\nthat it provides no support at all for the Board’s prayer practice. Rowan County and its\n\nsupporting amici do not cite a single authority suggesting that the First Congress engaged\n\nin a practice similar to the one at issue — that is, having one of its own members deliver\n\n                                            50\n\fthe opening prayer. Perhaps most notably, my dissenting colleagues cannot cite any such\n\nauthority either.\n\n       This stands to reason. A search of the Journals of House and Senate from 1789 to\n\n1791, the official contemporaneous records of the proceedings in the First Congress, and\n\nthe Annals of Congress, which were compiled later from the best available sources from\n\nthat time period, does not yield even one example of legislator-led prayer during the First\n\nCongress. The Framers apparently relied exclusively on chaplain-led prayer to solemnize\n\ntheir proceedings.    Of course, this does not establish that legislator-led prayer is\n\nunconstitutional, but it does preclude any argument that legislator-led prayer must be\n\nconstitutional because the First Congress approved of it.\n\n       Rather than cite historical evidence that is truly probative of the meaning of the\n\nEstablishment Clause, the principal dissent relies on recent instances of legislator-led\n\nprayer in Congress, none of which occurred before 1973; the contemporary practices of\n\nstate and local legislatures; the practice of the South Carolina Provincial Congress; and a\n\nvague, citation-free statement from the late Senator Robert C. Byrd that senators have\n\ngiven the opening prayer “from time to time.” See 2 Robert C. Byrd, The Senate 1789 –\n\n1989: Addresses on the History of the United States Senate 305 & 647 n.17 (Wendy\n\nWolff ed., 1991) (citing two resolutions as support for a different proposition). In the\n\nhistorical analysis endorsed by the Marsh Court, this is very thin gruel. And it is\n\ncertainly no substitute for the Framers’ own practice and understandings.\n\n       Furthermore, the limits the Framers imposed on their own practice of chaplain-led\n\nprayer provide significant evidence of what they believed to be the dividing line between\n\n                                            51\n\fpermissible and impermissible legislative prayer. By the standards of an overwhelmingly\n\nProtestant society, the First Congress took pains to ensure that its own legislative prayer\n\npractice remained religiously neutral, both in appearance and in practice. As one of its\n\nvery first orders of business, the House and Senate formed committees “to take under\n\nconsideration the manner of electing Chaplains.” S. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 10\n\n(1789).    On April 15, 1789, the Senate committee reported back with a proposed\n\nresolution:\n\n       That two Chaplains, of different denominations, be appointed to Congress,\n       for the present session, the Senate to appoint one, and give notice thereof to\n       the House of Representatives, who shall, thereupon, appoint the other;\n       which Chaplains shall commence their services in the Houses that appoint\n       them, but shall interchange weekly.\n\nId. at 12 (emphases added); see also Marsh, 463 U.S. at 793 n.13. The Senate adopted\n\nthe resolution, S. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1789), and the House concurred two\n\ndays later, H.R. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1789). The Senate went on to elect\n\nSamuel Provoost, an Episcopalian bishop, as its first chaplain, and the House in turn\n\nelected William Linn, a Presbyterian minister. S. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1789);\n\nH.R. Journal, 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 26 (1789). *\n\n       This history surely reflects the Framers’ concern with avoiding even a suggestion\n\nthat Congress subscribed to the tenets of a single religion. I can discern no other reason\n\n       *\n         This rule stood without interruption for the next sixty-one years. Along the way,\nCongress rejected proposals that would have omitted or specifically struck the “of\ndifferent denominations” language in 1800, 1810, 1845, 1846, and 1847. S. Journal, 6th\nCong., 2d Sess. 109 (1800); S. Journal, 11th Cong., 3d Sess. 526 (1810); H.R. Journal,\n11th Cong., 3d Sess. 441 (1810); H.R. Journal, 29th Cong., 1st Sess. 72 (1845); H.R.\nJournal, 29th Cong., 2d Sess. 52 (1846); H.R. Journal, 30th Cong., 1st Sess. 59 (1847).\n\n                                             52\n\fwhy the House and Senate would have bound themselves to select chaplains of different\n\ndenominations and to rotate their chaplains so often.      The Framers understood that\n\nlegislative prayer, even when led exclusively by chaplains, can be just as dangerous as\n\nother forms of government-sponsored religious activity unless measures are taken to\n\navoid a sectarian preference, or even the appearance of one.\n\n      The Board’s practice in the case at hand simply does not fit the tradition of\n\nlegislative prayer the First Congress began.      In the aggregate, the Board’s practice\n\namounts to an advancement of the tenets of a preferred religion. The members of the\n\nFirst Congress, who were far less acquainted with religious diversity than we are today,\n\nmanaged to avoid this, and they fashioned their own prayer practice to do so. Surely,\n\nRowan County can do the same.\n\n\n\n                                           III.\n\n      The Supreme Court has not disavowed the fundamental rule that a legislative body\n\nmay not use its prayer opportunity to promote or affiliate itself with one religion to the\n\nexclusion of others.

By ignoring\n\nthese values, the majority is able to mischaracterize and thus misapply those\n\nconstitutional provisions.\n\n\n                                             54\n\f       The majority’s most basic error is its underlying assumption that the\n\nEstablishment Clause is an anti-religion clause that exists in tension with the Free\n\nExercise Clause. This, however, misunderstands the Establishment Clause’s role. In his\n\nseminal book on the subject, Philip Hamburger details how the Establishment Clause was\n\nactually included in the Constitution to enhance the free exercise of religion by\n\nprohibiting establishments that favored one religion to the detriment of others:\n\n       These established churches (Episcopal in the southern states and\n       Congregationalist in most New England states) were established through\n       state laws that, most notably, gave government salaries to ministers on\n       account of their religion. Whereas the religious liberty demanded by most\n       dissenters was a freedom from the laws that created these establishments,\n       the separation of church and state was an old, anticlerical, and, increasingly,\n       antiecclesiastical conception of the relationship between church and state.\n       As might be expected, therefore, separation was not something desired by\n       most religious dissenters or guaranteed by the First Amendment. Indeed, it\n       was quite distinct from the religious liberty protected in any clause of an\n       American constitution, whether that of the federal government or that of\n       any state.\n\n                                          * * *\n\n       The religious dissenters who participated in the campaign against\n       establishments and whose claims seem to have affected the wording of the\n       constitutional guarantees against establishments made demands for a\n       religious liberty that limited civil government, especially civil legislation,\n       rather than for a religious liberty conceived as a separation of church and\n       state. Moreover, in attempting to prohibit the civil legislation that would\n       establish religion, they sought to preserve the power of government to\n       legislate on religion in other ways.\n\n\nPhilip Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 10, 107 (2002).\n\n       Hamburger thus details how the Establishment Clause was designed to enable the\n\npresence of religion in civic life without impairing the religious diversity central to the\n\n\n                                             55\n\fRepublic. This is a far different understanding than that assumed by the majority, in\n\nwhich the Establishment Clause is designed to erect barriers around public life through\n\nwhich expressions of faith are not allowed. The majority seems to understand religious\n\nfreedom as freedom from religion, not as the freedom to practice religion openly in all\n\naspects of American life.\n\n      The free exercise of religion, including prayer practice, as enhanced by the\n\nprohibition of establishments, has been recognized as profoundly important to the vitality\n\nof American democracy and liberty — an important aspect of the Founders’ genius. In\n\nhis magnum opus Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville observed about America\n\nin the 1830s:\n\n      [A] democratic and republican religion . . . contributed powerfully to the\n      establishment of a republic and a democracy in public affairs; and from the\n      beginning, politics and religion contracted an alliance which has never\n      been dissolved.\n\n1 Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America at 311 (Henry Reeve trans., Vintage\n\nBooks 1960) (emphasis added). Tocqueville explained the benefit of the relationship,\n\nobserving that “despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot. Religion is much\n\nmore necessary in the republic . . . than in the monarchy.” Id. at 318. The theoretical\n\nbasis underpinning this observation was that “religion sustains a successful struggle with\n\nthat spirit of individual independence which is her most dangerous opponent.” 2 id. at\n\n29.\n\n      And this deeply grounded balance of democracy, religion, and freedom is well\n\nrecognized in our jurisprudence, as eloquently and unambiguously related in Supreme\n\n\n                                           56\n\fCourt cases. For instance, in Marsh v. Chambers, when the Court evaluated the practice\n\nof legislative prayer, its analysis was rooted in the Founders’ recognition of the practice’s\n\nvalue. The Court observed, “The opening of sessions of legislative and other deliberative\n\npublic bodies with prayer is deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country.\n\nFrom colonial times through the founding of the Republic and ever since, the practice of\n\nlegislative prayer has coexisted with the principles of disestablishment and religious\n\nfreedom.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 786 (emphasis added). In light of this history, the Court\n\naccepted “the interpretation of the First Amendment draftsmen who saw no real threat to\n\nthe Establishment Clause arising from a practice of prayer.” Id. at 791. It concluded that\n\n“there can be no doubt that the practice of opening legislative sessions with prayer has\n\nbecome part of the fabric of our society.” Id. at 792 (emphasis added).\n\n       In Town of Greece, the Court echoed these sentiments, stressing the value of faith\n\nexpression in public life. As the Court recognized, “That the First Congress provided for\n\nthe appointment of chaplains only days after approving language for the First\n\nAmendment demonstrates that the Framers considered legislative prayer a benign\n\nacknowledgment of religion’s role in society.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819\n\n(emphasis added). The Court stated that any test under the Establishment Clause “must\n\nacknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical\n\nscrutiny of time and political change.” Id. After all, any “test that would sweep away\n\nwhat has so long been settled would create new controversy and begin anew the very\n\ndivisions along religious lines that the Establishment Clause seeks to prevent.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                             57\n\f       Simply put, there is no ambiguity in the historical role and importance of\n\nlegislative prayer in civic life. In both Marsh and Town of Greece, the Court was entirely\n\nclear about this.    And, in each case, the Court took pains to mention that the\n\nEstablishment Clause was intended to protect, rather than constrain, public expression of\n\nreligious faith.\n\n       The majority refuses to recognize the importance of religion — and of legislative\n\nprayer in particular — to democracy and American civic life. And its decision to “pay\n\nclose attention to the interplay between the various facets of the County’s prayer\n\npractice” to assess whether it is too sectarian, ante at 23, unwisely inserts government\n\ninto the role of regulating faith expression in precisely the way the Establishment Clause\n\nwas intended to forbid.      To be sure, prayer practice can be misused, rendering it\n\nunprotected, when it denigrates or interferes with the religious practice of others. But\n\nshort of those abuses, it ought not to be subject to the scrutiny and skepticism with which\n\nit is met by the majority. The proper respect for a practice so venerated and important to\n\nour democratic order does not include the niggling of civil courts assessing whether the\n\npractice “pointedly” invokes a particular name of the Divine to bless and solemnize the\n\ngovernmental proceeding. Ante at 4. In carrying out its self-assigned mission to police\n\nRowan County’s prayer practice, the majority turns its back on the historical role and\n\nvalues of religion and prayer, as well as the principles of Town of Greece, and recasts the\n\nlaw and facts to serve its mission.\n\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\f                                                II\n\n       In order to advance its theory of the Establishment Clause, the majority opinion\n\nbrushes past Town of Greece through an attempt to distinguish it. This effort relies on the\n\ndistinction that the case before us involves invocations given by the legislators, while\n\nTown of Greece involved prayers given by chaplains, and then concludes casually that\n\nthis difference takes this case “well outside the confines of Town of Greece.” Ante at 21.\n\nHaving found that handle, the majority then considers itself absolved of precedent and\n\nfree to launch its own freestanding analysis.\n\n       A closer look at the distinction of which the majority makes so much, however,\n\ndemonstrates that its analysis is nothing but a loosely disguised rationalization adopted to\n\nopen the way to its new approach. The fact that the prayer-giver in Rowan County was a\n\ncommissioner, not a minister designated or hired by the Board of Commissioners,\n\nresonates with nothing in Town of Greece, nor has anything outside of the majority\n\nopinion itself ever suggested that the status of the person giving an invocation is material\n\nto the constitutional analysis. Indeed, the Court has never specified which individuals are\n\nallowed to pray publicly. On the contrary, both Marsh and Town of Greece teach that the\n\npurpose of legislative prayer “is largely to accommodate the spiritual needs of\n\nlawmakers,” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1826. It is thus not surprising that the\n\nhistorical facts of the long-standing tradition of prayer practice at governmental\n\nassemblies show that prayer-givers can include governmental officials or members of the\n\nassembly. In the U.S. Congress, for example, prayers have been given not only by the\n\nhired Chaplain, but also by Members of Congress. Similarly, the amicus brief filed by\n\n                                            59\n\fthe States shows that a majority of state and territorial legislators rely on lawmaker-led\n\ninvocations. And they show the same is true for local governments, where the practice of\n\ngovernment officials giving the invocations is widespread.\n\n       The majority’s pro forma distinction of Town of Greece can only be driven by its\n\ndesire to reach a different end, because the nature of Rowan County’s prayer practice is,\n\nin all aspects of plaintiffs’ complaints, virtually indistinguishable from the practice\n\nupheld by the Supreme Court in Town of Greece. As Judge Agee shows in detail, Town\n\nof Greece upheld the prayer practice in the context of a small local political assembly, as\n\nis the case here; Town of Greece upheld prayers primarily invoking Jesus and other\n\nChristian elements, as is the case here; Town of Greece upheld the request to stand for\n\nprayer, as is the case here; and Town of Greece rejected the complaints about the prayers\n\nbeing “offensive, intolerable, and an affront to a diverse community,” 134 S. Ct. at 1817\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted), as made by the plaintiffs here. The Town of Greece\n\nCourt also rejected the argument, which the majority embraces here, that it was the\n\ntotality of these elements that offended the Establishment Clause.\n\n       To advance its mission under the banner of the Establishment Clause, the majority\n\nopinion also spins the facts to suggest that Rowan County is, through some unwritten\n\nagreement of its Commissioners, coercing its citizens to pray Christian prayers. It states\n\nthat the prayer practice was designed “to identify the government with Christianity”; that\n\nthe five Commissioners “maintained exclusive and complete control over the content of\n\nprayers”; that the Commissioners agreed on the prayer “featuring but a single faith”; and\n\nthat the prayer was “pointedly sectarian.” Ante at 4, 10, 20, 4 (emphasis added and\n\n                                            60\n\fcitations omitted). The record, however, simply does not support any such suggestion of\n\ncoercion, exclusion, or agreement.\n\n       Rather, under the practice of Rowan County, as set forth in the record, one of the\n\nfive Commissioners, in rotation, gives a brief invocation according to that\n\nCommissioner’s individual discretion,       without any prestanding instruction or\n\nunderstanding about the content or nature of the invocation. Each Commissioner has\n\naffirmed by affidavit that the nature and composition of the invocation — or indeed a\n\nmoment of silence — is left entirely to the discretion of the Commissioner and that there\n\nis no policy — written or unwritten — “regarding the form or content of any\n\ncommissioner’s Invocation.” And each has stated that the invocation is given “for the\n\nedification and benefit of the commissioners and to solemnize the meeting.” The fact\n\nthat the prayers were Christian in nature only reflected each prayer-giver’s religion, not\n\nsome design, policy, or agreement of the Commissioners.\n\n       Thus, evading the lessons of Town of Greece and armed with recharacterized facts,\n\nthe majority conducts its own analysis, based in large part on isolated quotations from the\n\nauthor’s own opinions, either in dissent or overruled, or from the very district court\n\nopinion it is reviewing in this case. This approach amounts simply to a barely disguised\n\ndisagreement with the Supreme Court’s support of sectarian legislative prayer in Town of\n\nGreece.\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\f                                            III\n\n       The reason behind the majority’s wayward approach is not a total mystery. Judge\n\nWilkinson, writing for the majority, and the ACLU, representing the plaintiffs, have acted\n\nwith harmonious parallelism, both having sought to circumvent the application of Town\n\nof Greece, and to return to the principles of Joyner v. Forsyth County, which Town of\n\nGreece overruled.\n\n       In February 2012, the ACLU complained to the Rowan County Commissioners\n\nabout the “practice of convening Board meetings with sectarian prayer, particularly\n\nChristian prayers,” (emphasis added), and, to support its position, quoted Judge\n\nWilkinson’s opinion in Joyner, which held that legislative prayer is appropriate “only\n\nwhen it is nonsectarian,” 653 F.3d at 345, and that, in order to embrace a nonsectarian\n\nideal, States and local governmental entities must be “proactive in discouraging sectarian\n\nprayer in public settings,” id. at 353 (emphasis added). Then, shortly after the decision in\n\nTown of Greece was handed down, the ACLU announced, “This morning, the Supreme\n\nCourt issued a disappointing and troubling decision upholding a town board’s practice of\n\nopening its meetings with Christian prayers.” Heather L. Weaver, Supreme Court Turns\n\nBlind Eye to Exclusionary Prayers at Government Meetings, ACLU (May 5, 2014, 2:57\n\nPM), https://perma.cc/2UGE-5TNL.\n\n       Similarly, in his dissent in this case from the panel’s application of Town of\n\nGreece to uphold Rowan County’s prayer practice, Judge Wilkinson lamented that the\n\nprayers in this case were “uniformly sectarian, referencing one and only one faith.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 431 (4th Cir. 2013) (Wilkinson, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).              He\n\n                                            62\n\fcontinued, “I have seen nothing like it,” id., even though Town of Greece explicitly\n\nupheld uniformly sectarian prayer made in the tradition of only one faith.         In this\n\ndissenting opinion, Judge Wilkinson essentially sought to return to his own earlier\n\nopinion in Joyner, where he had held that opening a meeting with sectarian prayer\n\nviolated the Establishment Clause because the prayers “referred to Jesus, Jesus Christ,\n\nChrist, or Savior with overwhelming frequency.” Joyner, 653 F.3d at 349 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). His panel dissent thus concluded that, “[t]he desire of this fine\n\ncounty for prayer at the opening of its public sessions can be realized in non-\n\ndenominational prayer.” Lund, 837 F.3d. at 437 (Wilkinson, J., dissenting) (emphasis\n\nadded) (adopting the ACLU’s position that sectarian prayer was unconstitutional). But\n\nagain, these very conclusions were overruled in Town of Greece, which upheld uniformly\n\nsectarian prayer given at similar local governmental meetings.\n\n      The positions taken by the ACLU and Judge Wilkinson, while uncannily\n\nharmonious with each other, are starkly at odds with Town of Greece, relying on the very\n\narguments rejected by the Supreme Court in both Marsh and Town of Greece. In Marsh,\n\nthe Court rejected arguments based on the facts (1) that the legislative prayer was given\n\nby a clergyman of only one denomination for 16 years; (2) that public funds were used to\n\npay for the services of the prayer-giver; and (3) that the prayers were in a single faith\n\ntradition. And in Town of Greece, the Court rejected arguments based on the facts\n\n(1) that the prayers were given disproportionately by Christians; (2) that this disparity\n\neffectively sponsored sectarian prayers, given predominantly in the name of Jesus;\n\n(3) that the prayer givers began by asking the audience to stand and by saying, “Let us\n\n                                            63\n\fpray”; and (4) that the totality of the circumstances “conveyed the message that Greece\n\nwas endorsing Christianity.” 134 S. Ct. at 1818. Reading the majority opinion here in\n\nlight of Town of Greece, one could well believe that Justice Kagan’s dissent was in fact\n\ncontrolling.\n\n                                       *      *     *\n\n       At bottom, there simply is no constitutional defect in the prayer practice followed\n\nby Rowan County, and the majority’s effort to find it unconstitutional, despite Town of\n\nGreece, is, I respectfully suggest, aberrational.\n\n\n\n\n                                              64\n\fAGEE, Circuit Judge, with whom Judge Niemeyer, Judge Traxler, Judge Shedd, and\nJudge Diaz join, dissenting:\n\n       The majority holds that the Rowan County Board of Commissioners’ practice of\n\nopening its public meetings with a commissioner-led invocation violates the\n\nEstablishment Clause.

For many years, the Board has permitted each commissioner, on a rotating basis,\n\nto offer an invocation before the meetings. 2\n\n       Typically, the Board chair would call the meeting to order and invite the other\n\ncommissioners and public audience to stand for the ceremonial opening. A designated\n\ncommissioner would then offer an invocation of his or her choosing followed by the\n\nPledge of Allegiance. The content of each invocation was entirely in the discretion of the\n\nrespective commissioner; the Board neither composed the prayer nor policed its content.\n\nThe prayers frequently, though not invariably, invoked the Christian faith.

Once this\n\nceremonial part of the meeting concluded, the Board turned to its public business.\n\n        Rowan County residents Nancy Lund, Liesa Montag–Siegel, and Robert Voelker\n\n(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle\n\nDistrict of North Carolina “to challenge the constitutionality of [the Board’s] practice of\n\ndelivering sectarian prayer at meetings.” J.A. 10. Plaintiffs alleged that the prayer\n\npractice unconstitutionally affiliated the Board with one particular faith and caused them\n\nto feel excluded as “outsiders.” J.A. 12. In addition, they alleged that the overall\n\natmosphere was coercive, requiring them to participate so they “would not stand out,”\n\nSuppl. J.A. 2, or otherwise be singled out in a manner they speculated might negatively\n\naffect business before the Board.\n\n        Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the Board’s prayer practice violated\n\nthe Establishment Clause, along with an injunction preventing any similar future prayers.\n\nPlaintiffs successfully obtained a preliminary injunction based on now-abrogated case\n\nlaw from this Court which had held that sectarian legislative prayer violated the\n\nEstablishment Clause.

Legislative prayer is its own genre of Establishment Clause\n\njurisprudence, assessed under a different framework that takes the unique circumstances\n\nof its historical practice and acceptance into account. See Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n1818 (“Marsh is sometimes described as ‘carving out an exception’ to the Court’s\n\nEstablishment Clause jurisprudence, because it sustained legislative prayer without\n\nsubjecting the practice to any of the formal tests that have traditionally structured this\n\ninquiry.”).\n\n       The Supreme Court first articulated this approach in Marsh, which involved a\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of the Nebraska legislature’s practice of having a paid\n\nchaplain offer a prayer to open each legislative session. Recounting the long-standing\n\nAmerican tradition of opening legislative sessions with prayer, the Supreme Court traced\n\nthe history of legislative prayer “[f]rom colonial times through the founding of the\n\nRepublic and ever since.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 786.\n\n       The Court ascribed particular significance to the views of the First Congress,\n\nwhich, “as one of its early items of business, adopted the policy of selecting a chaplain to\n\nopen each session with prayer.” Id. at 787–88. The Senate and House, in turn, appointed\n\nofficial chaplains in 1789. Id. at 788. Placing great significance on these events, the\n\n                                            68\n\fCourt explained those acts reflected how legislative prayer fit into the Founders’\n\nunderstanding of the Establishment Clause: “It can hardly be thought that . . . they\n\nintended the Establishment Clause . . . to forbid what they had just declared acceptable.”\n\nId. at 790. “This unique history [led the Court] to accept the interpretation of the First\n\nAmendment draftsmen who saw no real threat to the Establishment Clause arising from\n\n[the] practice of [legislative] prayer[.]” Id. at 791.\n\n       Having upheld the constitutionality of legislative prayer in general, the Marsh\n\nCourt next considered whether Nebraska’s practice fell within the bounds of the First\n\nAmendment. In particular, the Court considered the plaintiff’s specific challenges to\n\nthree characteristics of Nebraska’s legislative prayer practice: (1) the State had selected a\n\nrepresentative of “only one denomination” for sixteen years; (2) the chaplain was a paid\n\nstate employee; and (3) his prayers were offered “in the Judeo–Christian tradition.” Id. at\n\n792–93.\n\n       The Court rejected each claim. First, the Court observed that the First Congress\n\n“did not consider opening prayers as a proselytizing activity or as symbolically placing\n\nthe government’s official seal of approval on one religious view.” Id. at 792. Next, it\n\nnoted that there was no evidence that the chaplain’s long tenure “stemmed from an\n\nimpermissible motive,” and thus his continuous appointment did “not in itself conflict\n\nwith the Establishment Clause.” Id. at 793–94. That the chaplain was paid from public\n\nfunds was similarly “grounded in historic practice” and thus not prohibited. Id. at 794.\n\nLastly, as for the content of the prayers, the Court explained it was “not of concern”\n\nbecause “there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to\n\n                                               69\n\fproselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.” Id. at 794–95.\n\nAccordingly, the Court declined “to parse the [prayer] content.” Id. at 795.\n\n       In County of Allegheny v. ACLU Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112331\"><a href=\"/opinion/112331/allegheny-county-v-greater-pittsburgh-aclu/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578–\n\n79, 602 (1989), a case about the constitutionality of two religious holiday displays\n\nlocated on public property, the Court referred in dicta to its prior holding in Marsh,\n\nobserving that “[t]he legislative prayers involved in Marsh did not violate [the\n\nEstablishment Clause] because the particular chaplain had removed all references to\n\nChrist.” Id. at 603. In additional dicta, the Court observed that “not even the unique\n\nhistory of legislative prayer can justify contemporary legislative prayers that have the\n\neffect of affiliating the government with any one specific faith or belief.” Id.\n\n       Whatever fleeting persuasiveness that dicta merited, the Supreme Court\n\nunequivocally rejected it in Town of Greece. There, the Court explicitly disavowed any\n\nconstitutional requirement that legislative prayers be nonsectarian to comply with the\n\nEstablishment Clause: “An insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single,\n\nfixed standard is not consistent with the tradition of legislative prayer outlined in [our]\n\ncases.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1820.\n\n       The Town of Greece, New York, Board opened its monthly legislative meetings\n\nwith an invocation delivered by volunteer clergy. Guest chaplains were found by placing\n\ncalls to congregations listed in a local directory. Id. at 1816. Nearly all of these churches\n\nwere Christian, as were the guest clergy.         Most of the invocations referenced the\n\nChristian faith, but the Town Board was not aware of the prayer content beforehand, nor\n\ndid it attempt to edit the content of the prayer or otherwise instruct the prayer giver on\n\n                                             70\n\fwhat to say. Id. Though the Second Circuit concluded that this “steady drumbeat of\n\nChristian prayer . . . tended to affiliate the town with Christianity,” in violation of the\n\nEstablishment Clause, the Supreme Court disagreed. Id. at 1818.\n\n       The Supreme Court explained that Marsh instructed that the constitutionality of a\n\nlegislative prayer practice must be considered in light of “historical practices and\n\nunderstandings.” Id. at 1819; accord id. at 1818–19. A practice is constitutional so long\n\nas it “fits within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state legislatures”\n\nbecause “[a]ny test [we] adopt[ for analyzing invocations] must acknowledge a practice\n\nthat was accepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and\n\npolitical change.” Id.\n\n       The Court rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that legislative prayer must be to a\n\ngeneric god or otherwise nonsectarian to pass muster under the Establishment Clause by\n\nfocusing on three principles: the Framer’s understanding of legislative prayer, the\n\nhistorical place legislative prayer occupies in society, and avoiding official government\n\nentanglement in crafting the content of prayers. In addition, the Court recognized that\n\nlegislative prayer historically served a ceremonial function “at the opening of legislative\n\nsessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of\n\nthe Nation’s heritage.”     Id. at 1823.    Observing first that legislative invocations\n\ncontaining explicitly religious themes were accepted at the time of the First Congress and\n\nremained vibrant throughout American history to modern times, the Court concluded,\n\n“[a]n insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single, fixed standard is not\n\nconsistent with [our accepted] tradition of legislative prayer.” Id. at 1820. On this point,\n\n                                            71\n\fthe Court specifically disavowed Allegheny’s “nonsectarian” interpretation of Marsh as\n\ndictum “that was disputed when written and has been repudiated by later cases.” Id. at\n\n1821; see also id. (“Marsh nowhere suggested that the constitutionality of legislative\n\nprayer turns on the neutrality of its content.”).\n\n       The Court further observed that a content-based rule “would force the legislatures\n\nthat sponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases to act as\n\nsupervisors and censors of religious speech.” Id. at 1822. Enforcing specific content\n\nrestrictions would “involve government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is\n\nthe case under the town’s current practice of neither editing or approving prayers in\n\nadvance nor criticizing their content after the fact.” Id. “Once it invites prayer into the\n\npublic sphere,” the Court stated, “government must permit a prayer giver to address his or\n\nher own God or gods as conscience dictates, unfettered by what an administrator or judge\n\nconsiders to be nonsectarian.” Id. at 1822–23.\n\n       Synthesizing these factors, the Court fashioned three distinct, but related, holdings.\n\nFirst, the Court held that the years of prayers offered on behalf of the Town of Greece,\n\nalthough almost exclusively Christian, did not evince a pattern of denigration (of non-\n\nChristian faiths) or proselytization (to bolster Christianity).    Although some prayers\n\narguably contained proselytizing or disparaging content, the Court concluded that the\n\npractice as a whole served only to solemnize the board meetings. In other words, a few\n\nquestionable prayers were of no constitutional consequence. Id. at 1824.\n\n       Second, the Court determined to be of no moment the fact that the invited prayer\n\ngivers were predominantly Christian: “[s]o long as the town maintains a policy of\n\n                                              72\n\fnondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for\n\nnon-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing.” Id. Continuing,\n\nthe Court observed\n\n      [t]he quest to promote a diversity of religious views would require the town\n      to make wholly inappropriate judgments about the number of religions it\n      should sponsor and the relative frequency with which it should sponsor\n      each, a form of government entanglement with religion that is far more\n      troublesome than the current approach.\n\nId.\n\n      Third, the Court rebuffed the plaintiffs’ contention that the prayers\n\nunconstitutionally “coerce[] participation by nonadherents.” Id. (Kennedy, J., plurality\n\nopinion).   The Court acknowledged that “coercion” could render legislative prayer\n\nbeyond constitutional protection in some outlying circumstances, such as “[i]f the course\n\nand practice over time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbelievers or religious\n\nminorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion.” Id. at 1823 (majority opinion).\n\nAnd although Justices in the majority differed in their approaches, the Court nonetheless\n\nrejected the plaintiffs’ argument that coercion arose from either the context of a local\n\nmunicipal government meeting, or the prayer givers’ invitation that others could stand or\n\njoin in the prayer. Compare id. at 1824–28 (Sec. II.B of Justice Kennedy’s plurality\n\nopinion), with id. at 1837–38 (Sec. II of Justice Thomas’s concurring opinion).\n\n      Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, framed the\n\ncoercion inquiry as “a fact-sensitive one that considers both the setting in which the\n\nprayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed.” Id. at 1825 (plurality opinion).\n\nThese Justices found no coercion in Greece’s prayer practice, relying heavily on the\n\n                                           73\n\fhistorical approach of Marsh. They presumed that reasonable observers are aware of the\n\nmultiple traditions acknowledging God in this country, including legislative prayer, the\n\nPledge of Allegiance, and presidential prayers. They concluded that, because of these\n\ntraditions, citizens could appreciate the Town’s prayer practice without being compelled\n\nto participate. Id. Further, they observed that the prayers served a non-religious purpose:\n\nputting legislators in a contemplative state of mind and connecting them to the historical\n\ntradition of their forerunners. Id. at 1826. Justice Kennedy made clear that “[o]ffense . . .\n\ndoes not equate to coercion.” Id. He observed that “[a]dults often encounter speech they\n\nfind disagreeable,” even in a legislative forum, but that does not give rise to an\n\nEstablishment Clause violation. Id. Instead, the historical acceptance of legislative\n\nprayer recognizes that “citizens, firm in their own beliefs, can tolerate and perhaps\n\nappreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a person of a different faith.” Id. at 1823\n\n(majority opinion).\n\n       Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, interpreted the Establishment Clause to\n\nprohibit only “actual legal coercion,” which they defined as the exercise of “government\n\npower in order to exact financial support of the church, compel religious observance, or\n\ncontrol religious doctrine.” Id. at 1837 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in\n\nthe judgment).    As no evidence of actual legal coercion existed in this case, they\n\nconcurred in the Court’s judgment. Id. at 1837–38.\n\n       As this review of Marsh and Town of Greece confirms, our nation’s long historical\n\ntradition of welcoming and encouraging legislative prayer gives the practice a unique\n\nplace in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. It requires a different legal analysis than\n\n                                             74\n\fother types of government conduct touching on religion. The majority muddies the\n\ndistinct analysis required in this type of Establishment Clause case, relying on more\n\ngeneral principles applicable in other Establishment Clause contexts to avoid the clear\n\nlegal principles set out in Marsh and Town of Greece. 4 While lower court judges may\n\npersonally disagree with the principles the Supreme Court pronounces, they are not at\n\nliberty to ignore or dilute them.

Majority Op. 33. These principles are valid\ninsofar as they go. But taken at face value, they would also lead to the conclusion that sectarian\nlegislative prayers violate the Establishment Clause. See McCreary Cty. v. ACLU, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799993\"><a href=\"/opinion/799993/mccreary-county-v-american-civil-liberties-union-of-ky/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n859 n.10 (2005) (citing Marsh as an example of a permissible governmental action whose\n“manifest purpose was presumably religious”). Because Marsh and Town of Greece demand\notherwise, their principles in this particular context must govern instead.\n\n                                               75\n\fsetting.” Majority Op. 22–23. But a proper application of the principles of Marsh and\n\nTown of Greece to the Board’s prayer practices leads to the opposite conclusion. Indeed,\n\nthe Supreme Court has already addressed three of the four factors the majority relies on,\n\nand has explained why they do not serve as a basis for an Establishment Clause violation.\n\nThe only new feature in this case is the identity of the prayer giver. But—for the reasons\n\nexplained below—that single characteristic does not remove the Board’s practice from\n\nthe protected scope of Marsh and Town of Greece. In short, the majority wrongly\n\nconcludes that the sum of the parts is greater than the whole—that is, that the four factors\n\nthey present, which standing alone are undoubtedly constitutional, somehow combine to\n\nrender the Board’s legislative prayer practice unconstitutional.\n\n       Curiously, the majority accuses the dissents of lacking “any sense of balance.”\n\nMajority Op. 18. Even more curiously, it suggests we fail to “consider the prayer\n\npractice. . . holistically.”   Majority Op. 39.   However, the majority’s invocation of\n\nbalancing factors and viewing otherwise valid principles “holistically” in order to reach a\n\npreferred result is no camouflage for its lack of merit. In short, the majority misapplies\n\nTown of Greece’s assessment of how the factors are to be evaluated both individually and\n\nin tandem.\n\n       As we’ve set out at great length, the only factor that distinguishes this case from\n\nMarsh or Town of Greece is that, here, an individual commissioner gives a prayer on a\n\nrotating basis. We conclude that factor does not skew the totality of the circumstances to\n\nmake Rowan County’s practice unconstitutional.        We then recount why the remaining\n\naspects of the County’s practice align with the practices previously approved of—in the\n\n                                            76\n\faggregate—in Marsh and Town of Greece. That is precisely the sort of analysis Marsh\n\nand Town of Greece require.\n\n                                             A.\n\n       Town of Greece instructs that the constitutionality of legislative prayer hinges on\n\nits historical roots. Because legislative prayer has been a constant and recognized part of\n\ncivic life for more than two centuries, it “has become part of the fabric of our society.”\n\nTown of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819. Hence, if a prayer practice has long been “followed\n\nin Congress and the state legislatures,” courts must view it as “a tolerable\n\nacknowledgement of beliefs widely held” by people in the United States. Id. at 1818–19;\n\nsee also id. at 1819 (observing that prayer practices “accepted by the Framers and [which\n\nhave] withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change” must not be “swe[pt]\n\naway” because doing so “would create new controversy and begin anew the very\n\ndivisions along religious lines that the Establishment Clause seeks to prevent”).\n\n       The majority gives this principle only a curt nod before decrying the Board’s\n\npractice of lawmaker-led legislative prayer as “unprecedented.” Majority Op. 15. That\n\nconclusion cannot withstand review.\n\n                                             1.\n\n       Straightaway—and without any legal support for doing so—the majority attaches\n\nnear-dispositive meaning to the fact that lawmakers, as opposed to clergy, gave the\n\nlegislative prayers at issue in this case.        While both Marsh and Town of Greece\n\nconsidered prayers given by clergy, the distinction between state-selected clergy prayer,\n\non the one hand, and lawmaker-led prayer, on the other, is a distinction without a\n\n                                             77\n\fdifference. Neither Marsh nor Town of Greece attached particular significance to the\n\nidentity of the speakers. Moreover, the tradition and history of lawmaker-led prayers is\n\nas prevalent as that of other legislative prayer givers. Thus, contrary to the majority’s\n\nsuggestion, the fact that the Supreme Court has not specifically addressed lawmaker-led\n\nprayer signifies nothing. Could it simply be that until recently, no one since 1788 had\n\nconceived that legislators leading legislative prayers for legislators was outside the\n\nhistorical tradition “followed in Congress and the state legislatures”? Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1819. Contra Majority Op. 17 (“The conspicuous absence of case law on\n\nlawmaker-led prayer is likely no accident.”). 5\n\n       The Supreme Court’s analysis of legislative prayer in Marsh and Town of Greece\n\ndid not look to the speakers’ identities; instead, the Court confined its discussion to the\n\ncircumstances of the prayer practices before it. See Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1820–\n\n28; Marsh, 463 U.S. at 786–95.          Nowhere did the Court say anything that could\n\nreasonably be construed as a requirement that outside or retained clergy are the only\n\nconstitutional source of legislative prayer.        Quite the opposite, Town of Greece\n\nspecifically directs courts’ focus to what has been done in “Congress and the state\n\nlegislatures” without limitation regarding the officiant. 134 S. Ct. at 1819. Far from\n\nsuggesting that this case falls outside the scope of Marsh or Town of Greece, the Supreme\n\n\n       5\n         Neither Marsh nor Town of Greece specifically put into issue lawmaker-led legislative\nprayers as their focus was the issue of legislative prayer as a whole. That said, the record in\nTown of Greece shows that on at least one occasion a councilman offered a prayer during the\nceremonial opening. See Joint Appendix, Town of Greece v.

And in Simpson v.

Although these cases ultimately turned on the\n\nnow-rejected position that sectarian prayer was constitutionally invalid, none made the\n\nprayer giver’s identity a factor in, let alone dispositive of, its analysis.\n\n       That conclusion makes sense given that legislative prayer constitutes a form of\n\ngovernment speech regardless of the identity of the speaker; otherwise, it would not\n\nimplicate the Establishment Clause at all. See, e.g., Snyder v. Murray City Corp., 159\n\n                                               </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1238 (10th Cir. 1998) (Lucero, J., concurring in the judgment) (recognizing\n\nthat “chaplains speak for the legislature”). Practically speaking, the public is unlikely to\n\ndraw any meaningful distinction between a state-paid chaplain (Marsh) or state-invited\n\ncleric (Town of Greece) and members of the legislative body that appoints him. These\n\ninvited officiants are in essence “deputized” to speak on behalf of the governing body.\n\nCf. Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1850 (Kagan, J., dissenting). Yet the practice was\n\nconstitutional, even when those officiants aligned with a particular religion and were paid\n\nwith state funds. Because a paid or invited officiant stands on the same footing as the\n\nlegislators, it follows that elected representatives may also be their own prayer givers.\n\nAnd when they take on that role, their religious preference in the ceremonial invocation is\n\nno different than the state-sponsored clergy in Marsh and Town of Greece. The Supreme\n\nCourt directly observed in Town of Greece that a purpose of legislative prayer was to\n\nallow legislators to “show who and what they are” through their prayers. Id. at 1826\n\n(plurality opinion).   It thus makes abundant common and constitutional sense that\n\nlegislators are ideally suited to offer meaningful, heartfelt prayer to the audience of those\n\nprayers: their fellow legislators. Id. at 1825.\n\n       On a broader level, the very “history and tradition” anchoring Town of Greece\n\nunderscores a long-standing national practice of legislative prayer generally and\n\nlawmaker-led prayer specifically. Opening invocations offered by elected legislators\n\nhave long been accepted as both a mainstay of civic life and a permissible form of\n\nreligious observance. See S. Rep. No. 32-376, at 4 (1853) (commenting that the authors\n\nof the Establishment Clause “did not intend to prohibit a just expression of religious\n\n                                              80\n\fdevotion by the legislators of the nation, even in their public character as legislators”\n\n(emphasis added)); see also Lynch, 465 U.S. at 674 (“There is an unbroken history of\n\nofficial acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in\n\nAmerican life from at least 1789.”). As just one example, the South Carolina Provincial\n\nCongress—South Carolina’s first independent legislature—routinely welcomed an\n\nelected member to deliver invocations. See, e.g., South Carolina Provincial Congress,\n\nThanks to the Continental Congress (Jan. 11, 1775), http://amarch.lib.niu.edu/islandora\n\n/object/niu-amarch%3A94077 (last visited May 23, 2017) (saved as ECF opinion\n\nattachment). These early public pronouncements are important evidence demonstrating\n\nthat lawmaker-led legislative prayer was viewed no differently from legislative prayer as\n\na whole. To conclude otherwise is to impugn the practical wisdom of the Framers—a\n\nfactor that weighed heavily in Town of Greece—and to suggest “the founders of the\n\nUnited States were unable to understand their own handiwork.” Myers v. Loudoun Cty.\n\nPub. Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (4th Cir. 2005).\n\n      Equally troubling, the majority turns a blind eye to the prevalence of lawmaker-led\n\nlegislative prayer. A majority of states and territories honor requests from individual\n\nlegislators to give an opening invocation. See Nat’l Conference of State Legislatures,\n\nInside the Legislative Process 5–151 to –152 (2002), http://www.ncsl.org/documents\n\n/legismgt/ILP/02Tab5Pt7.pdf (observing legislators may offer an opening prayer in at\n\nleast thirty-one states). Lawmaker-led prayer is especially prevalent in the states under\n\nour jurisdiction, where seven of the ten legislative chambers utilize elected members for\n\nthis purpose. See id.; Br. of Amici Curiae State of West Virginia et al. Supporting Def.-\n\n                                           81\n\fAppellant at 14 & Add. 2–8; see also Office of Speaker Pro Tem Paul Stam, Prayers\n\nOffered     in   the     North   Carolina   House    of   Representatives:     2011–2014,\n\nhttp://nchousespeaker.com/docs/opening-prayers-nchouse-2011-2014.pdf         (last   visited\n\nMay 23, 2017).         Several of these states have enacted legislation recognizing and\n\nprotecting the historical practice of lawmaker-led prayer. For example, a Virginia statute\n\nprotects legislators who deliver a sectarian prayer during deliberative sessions. See Va.\n\nCode Ann. § 15.2-1416.1. And South Carolina expressly authorizes its elected officials\n\nto open meetings with prayer. See S.C. Code Ann. § 6-1-160(B)(1). Other states inside\n\nand outside our jurisdiction rely exclusively on lawmaker-led prayers. See, e.g., Mich.\n\nH.R. Rule 16 (requiring the clerk of the Michigan House of Representatives to “arrange\n\nfor a Member to offer an invocation” at the beginning of each session); Nat’l Conference\n\nof State Legislatures, supra, at 5-152 (the Rhode Island Senate); Kate Havard, In\n\ndelegates they trust: Md. House members lead secular prayer, Wash. Post (Mar. 9,\n\n2013),      https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/in-delegates-they-trust-md-\n\nhouse-members-lead-secular-prayer/2013/03/09/571fef8e-810a-11e2-8074-\n\nb26a871b165a_story.html.\n\n         Lawmaker-led prayer finds contemporary validation in the federal government as\n\nwell. Both houses of Congress allow members to deliver an opening invocation. The\n\ncongressional record is replete with examples of legislators commencing legislative\n\nbusiness with a prayer. See, e.g., 161 Cong. Rec. S3313 (daily ed. May 23, 2015) (prayer\n\nby Sen. James Lankford); 159 Cong. Rec. S3915 (daily ed. June 4, 2013) (prayer by Sen.\n\nWilliam M. Cowan); 155 Cong. Rec. S13401 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2009) (prayer by Sen.\n\n                                            82\n\fJohn Barrasso); 119 Cong. Rec. 17,441 (1973) (prayer by Rep. William H. Hudnut III);\n\nsee also 2 Robert C. Byrd, The Senate 1789-1989: Addresses on the History of the United\n\nStates Senate 305 (Wendy Wolff ed., 1990) (“Senators have, from time to time, delivered\n\nthe prayer.”).\n\n       Particularly relevant to this case, lawmaker-led prayers frequently accompany the\n\nopening of local governmental meetings. See, e.g., Br. of Amici Curiae State of West\n\nVirginia et al. Supporting Def.-Appellant at 24–26 & Add. 11–43. In many localities,\n\nthose prayers are exclusively lawmaker-led. See id.; see also Suppl. Br. of Amici Curiae\n\nState of West Virginia et al. Supporting Def.-Appellant Seeking Reversal at 9–10 &\n\nA10–A54.\n\n       In view of this long and varied tradition of lawmaker-led prayer, any wall barring\n\nelected legislators from religious invocations runs headlong into the Supreme Court’s\n\nacknowledgement that “[a]ny test [we] adopt[] must acknowledge a practice that was\n\naccepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political\n\nchange.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1819. As Justice Alito aptly explained, “if there\n\nis any inconsistency between any [Establishment Clause] test[] and the historic practice\n\nof legislative prayer, the inconsistency calls into question the validity of the test, not the\n\nhistoric practice.” Id. at 1834 (Alito, J., concurring). The majority’s conclusion strikes\n\ndown a legislative prayer practice that is “part of the fabric of our society.” Id. at 1819\n\n(majority opinion).\n\n\n\n\n                                             83\n\f                                            2.\n\n       The majority couples its angst about the identity of the prayer giver in this case\n\nwith “legislators [being] the only eligible prayer-givers.” Majority Op. 17. That again is\n\na fact without constitutional significance. The fact that the overwhelming majority of the\n\nprayers represented the Christian faith stems not from any “aversion or bias on the part of\n\ntown leaders against minority faiths,” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824, but from the\n\ncomposition of the Board. Town of Greece made clear that the Constitution does not\n\nrequire the government actively court religious balance “[s]o long as the town maintains\n\na policy of nondiscrimination.” Id.; see also Pelphrey v. Cobb Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78156\"><a href=\"/opinion/78156/pelphrey-v-cobb-county-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1281\n\n(11th Cir. 2008) (“[Marsh] does not require that all faiths be allowed the opportunity to\n\npray. The standard instead prohibits purposeful discrimination.”).\n\n       There is no indicia of discrimination in this record. None. Nor is there any\n\nsuggestion that the Board has or would bar any commissioner from offering a prayer\n\nfaithful to the commissioner’s own traditions, regardless of his or her faith. Without such\n\nevidence, we cannot conclude that the Board’s prayer practice unconstitutionally limits\n\nthe universe of prayer givers in violation of the Establishment Clause.\n\n       The majority implicitly acknowledges the lack of evidence in the record on this\n\npoint, and so instead faults the Board’s “rigid, restrictive” prayer practice as contrasted\n\nwith the “flexible, inclusive approach upheld in Town of Greece.” Majority Op. 24. That\n\nwidely misses the point.\n\n       Marsh and Town of Greece were both acceptable legislative prayer practices, but\n\nneither imposed a fixed standard for the nature or number of prayer givers that would be\n\n                                            84\n\fconstitutional. Just because the Supreme Court has upheld a more “flexible, inclusive\n\napproach” does not mean that other, more structured approaches are thereby\n\nunconstitutional. If anything, the prayer practice here is far more “inclusive” and multi-\n\nfaceted than the one the Supreme Court approved in Marsh, with only one prayer giver\n\nfrom one faith tradition. See infra Sec. II. Moreover, while Town of Greece’s practice\n\nresulted in a larger population of prayer givers, the majority elevates diversity to be the\n\nsine qua non of constitutionality.     See Majority Op. 23–25 (citing the need for a\n\nconstitutional practice to “embrac[e] religious pluralism and the possibility of a\n\ncorrespondingly diverse invocation practice,” and considering whether a particular prayer\n\npractice could be more welcoming or do more to “cultivate[] an atmosphere of greater\n\ntolerance and inclusion”); see also Majority Op. 32 (expounding that “legislative prayer\n\ngives voice to the ecumenical dimensions of religious faith”). But Marsh and Town of\n\nGreece do not require enforced ecumenicalism nor do they demand denominational\n\ndiversity; indeed, the Supreme Court expressly distanced itself from such a requirement.\n\nE.g., Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824 (rejecting the view that lawmaking bodies must\n\n“promote a diversity of religious views”). Instead, the Court focused on whether the\n\nlegislature’s practice—whatever that practice might be—evinces an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory motive. Here, the record reflects none.\n\n       In short, the Supreme Court’s prohibition on discrimination in this context is\n\naimed at barring government practices that result from a deliberate choice to favor one\n\nreligious view to the exclusion of others. As explained in Town of Greece, concerns arise\n\nonly if there is evidence of “an aversion or bias on the part of town leaders against\n\n                                            85\n\fminority faiths” in choosing the prayer giver. Id. The Marsh Court likewise alluded to\n\nthis requirement when it cautioned that the selection of a guest chaplain cannot stem from\n\n“an impermissible motive.” 463 U.S. at 793. This parameter is directed at the conscious\n\nselection of the prayer giver on account of religious affiliation or conscious\n\ndiscrimination against a prayer giver due to a religious affiliation. See id. Because\n\nthere’s no evidence of either in this record, the limited-universe of prayer givers does not\n\nviolate the principles espoused in Marsh and Town of Greece.\n\n       In another misreading of Supreme Court precedent, the majority contorts Marsh to\n\nfoster its novel rule mandating a broad universe of eligible prayer givers. A contextual\n\nreview of Marsh leads to the opposite conclusion: the Nebraska legislature paid the same\n\nPresbyterian minister to offer prayers for sixteen years. 463 U.S. at 785, 793. In\n\nrejecting the argument that this closed universe of prayer givers created a constitutional\n\nconcern, the Supreme Court observed, “[a]bsent proof that the chaplain’s reappointment\n\nstemmed from an impermissible motive, we conclude that his long tenure does not in\n\nitself conflict with the Establishment Clause.” Id. at 793–94. While it is true that other\n\nindividuals occasionally substituted for the Nebraska chaplain, the fact remained that the\n\noverwhelming majority of prayers during that sixteen-year period were given by a single\n\nstate-paid prayer giver from a single faith tradition. Even so—and entirely consistent\n\nwith the Court’s later statements in Town of Greece—that fact did not give rise to a\n\nconstitutional concern because there was, as here, no evidence of an impermissible\n\nmotive. 134 S. Ct. at 1824. Marsh’s facts and holding stand for the principle that the\n\nselection of a single legislative prayer giver, or a limited set of prayer givers, who\n\n                                            86\n\frepresent a single religious tradition does not advance any one faith or belief over\n\nanother. See 463 U.S. at 793 (“We cannot, any more than Members of the Congresses of\n\nthis century, perceive any suggestion that choosing a clergyman of one denomination\n\nadvances the beliefs of a particular church.”); Ctr. for Inquiry, Inc. v. Marion Circuit\n\nCourt Clerk, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 874 (7th Cir. 2014) (“Marsh and Greece show that a\n\ngovernment may, consistent with the First Amendment, open legislative sessions with\n\nChristian prayers while not inviting leaders of other religions[.]”).\n\n       A fortiori, Town of Greece does not support the majority’s expansive view. Not\n\nonly are the legislators themselves the intended “congregation” for legislative prayer,\n\nTown of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1825 (plurality opinion), but the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized that legislative prayer practices carry special meaning to the thousands of\n\nlocal and state “citizen representatives” throughout this country. In fact, the Supreme\n\nCourt in Town of Greece specifically acknowledged “members of town boards and\n\ncommissions, who often serve part-time and as volunteers,” were lawmakers for whom\n\n“ceremonial prayer may . . . reflect the values they hold as private citizens.” Id. at 1826.\n\nTo repeat an earlier observation, if legislative prayer particularly reflects the values of\n\n“citizen representatives,” then it stands to reason that these “citizen representatives”\n\nshould be able to lead prayers in a way that connects with their intended audience:\n\nthemselves. Id. Legislators are uniquely qualified to offer uplifting, heartfelt prayer on\n\nmatters that concern themselves and their colleagues.\n\n       These precepts also demonstrate why lawmaker-led prayer does not, as the\n\nmajority misconstrues, violate the principle that governments not be in the business of\n\n                                             87\n\f“compos[ing] official prayers.” Compare Majority Op. 23 (quoting Lee v. Weisman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112779\"><a href=\"/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588 (1992)), with Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1822 (observing that requiring\n\nprayers to be nonsectarian “would involve government in religious matters to a far greater\n\ndegree than is the case under the town’s current practice of neither editing or approving\n\nprayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact” (emphasis added)).\n\n       Here, the Board’s practice does not venture into impermissible writing or editing\n\nof religious speech. Rather, each commissioner gives his or her own prayer without\n\noversight, input, or direction from the Board, which does not supervise or censor the\n\nspeech of its individual commissioners in crafting the prayers.        Indeed, there is no\n\nevidence that the Board, as a Board, had any role in any of the prayers given by any of\n\nthe individual commissioners. The record is devoid of any suggestion that any prayer in\n\nthis case is anything but a personal creation of each commissioner acting in accord with\n\nhis or her personal views. As a consequence, each commissioner is essentially a free\n\nagent no different from the ministers in Town of Greece or the paid chaplain in Marsh,\n\nwho gave invocations of their own choosing. Contrary to the majority’s conclusion, the\n\nBoard’s practice does not present the same concerns as when the “government [attempts]\n\nto define permissible categories of religious speech.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1822\n\n(emphasis added). Instead, the Board’s legislative prayer practice amounts to nothing\n\nmore than an individual commissioner leading a prayer of his or her own choosing.\n\n\n\n\n                                             88\n\f       For all these reasons, the majority errs in concluding that commissioners\n\ndelivering the ceremonial prayer to open a Board meeting is a relevant distinguishing\n\nfeature for the constitutional analysis set out Marsh and Town of Greece. 6\n\n                                                B.\n\n       As the identity of the legislative prayer givers at issue has no cognizable\n\nconstitutional significance in this case, I turn next to the remaining characteristics of the\n\nBoard’s prayer practice discussed by the majority:                content, coercion, and local\n\ngovernment setting.      Although the Supreme Court has not forged a comprehensive\n\ntemplate for all acceptable legislative prayer, its decisions set out guideposts for\n\nanalyzing whether a particular practice goes beyond constitutional bounds. See Snyder,\n\n159 F.3d at 1233 (“Marsh implicitly acknowledges some constitutional limits on the\n\nscope and selection of legislative prayers[.]”).\n\n                                                1.\n\n       As the majority points out, one of the guideposts to acceptable legislative prayers\n\nis the content of those prayers. After reaffirming the holding in Marsh that lower courts\n\nshould refrain from becoming embroiled in review of the substance of legislative prayer,\n\n\n       6\n           The majority also conjures up the “risk of political division” arising from alleged\nconflicts concerning the Board’s prayer practice. Majority Op. 26. But neither audience-\ninitiated criticism of those who object to a prayer practice nor election-oriented policy statements\nby Board candidates are relevant to the issue of law before the Court. Questions concerning the\nwisdom of the practice of legislative prayer can be rightly debated in many squares, but the\njudiciary is not one of them. The Court’s task is solely to decide whether the Board’s practice is\nlawful under the First Amendment, not whether it is popular or wise.\n\n\n\n\n                                                89\n\fTown of Greece noted that there could be certain sectarian actions that might cause a\n\nlegislative prayer practice to fall outside constitutional protection, such as “[i]f the course\n\nand practice over time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbelievers or religious\n\nminorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion.” 134 S. Ct. at 1823. In that\n\ncircumstance, the Court observed, “many present may consider the prayer to fall short of\n\nthe desire to elevate the purpose of the occasion and to unite lawmakers in their common\n\neffort.” Id.\n\n       To this end, courts need only assure themselves that sectarian legislative prayer,\n\nviewed from a cumulative perspective, is not being exploited to, inter alia, proselytize or\n\ndisparage. Less egregious conduct warrants no further review. Indeed, the Supreme\n\nCourt has disclaimed any interest in the content of legislative invocations, announcing a\n\nstrong disinclination “to embark on a sensitive evaluation or to parse the content of a\n\nparticular prayer.” Marsh, 463 U.S. at 795. The record in this case demonstrates that the\n\nBoard’s prayer practice did not stray across the constitutional line of advancement,\n\nproselytization, or disparagement. In fact, the prayers here are much further from that\n\nline than those before the Supreme Court in Marsh and Town of Greece.\n\n       To reach the opposite conclusion, the majority selectively quotes a handful from\n\nthe hundreds of prayers offered in Board meetings to demonstrate what it perceives to be\n\nimpermissible “promotion” of Christianity. E.g., Majority Op. 28–32. But in so doing,\n\nthe majority untethers Town of Greece’s broader analysis from the specific prayers at\n\nissue in that case which the Supreme Court necessarily found did not cross any\n\nconstitutional line. Even a cursory comparison shows that the prayers highlighted by the\n\n                                              90\n\fmajority have less questionable language than that contained in the prayers upheld in\n\nMarsh and Town of Greece.\n\n      The content of the commissioners’ prayers largely encompassed universal themes,\n\nsuch as giving thanks and requesting divine guidance in deliberations, much in line with\n\nthe prayers challenged in Town of Greece. Cf. Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824\n\n(noting the prayers “invoked universal themes, as by celebrating the changing of the\n\nseasons or calling for a ‘spirit of cooperation’ among town leaders”). References to\n\nexclusively Christian concepts typically consisted of the opening or closing line, such as\n\n“In Jesus’ name. Amen,” exactly as in most prayers in Town of Greece. Compare Suppl.\n\nJ.A. 29–31, with Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1824 (noting a “number of the prayers did\n\ninvoke the name of Jesus, the Heavenly Father, or the Holy Spirit”).\n\n       The invocation delivered at the Board’s October 17, 2011, meeting illustrates what\n\nBoard members and the public would typically hear:\n\n      Let us pray. Father we do thank you for the privilege of being here tonight.\n      We thank you for the beautiful day you’ve given us, for health and strength,\n      for all the things we take for granted. Lord, as we read in the paper today,\n      the economic times are not good, and many people are suffering and doing\n      without. We pray for them; we pray that you would help us to help. We\n      pray for the decisions that we will make tonight, that God, they would\n      honor and glorify you. We pray that you would give us wisdom and\n      understanding. We’ll thank you for it. In Jesus’ name. Amen.\n\nSuppl. J.A. 31.\n\n      Some of the commissioners’ prayers contained more direct references to Christian\n\nteachings, but so did the prayers in Town of Greece. E.g., Majority Op. 28–32 (quoting\n\nprayers from the record). For example, the following prayers in Town of Greece gave the\n\n\n                                           91\n\fSupreme Court no pause, but would be anathema and forbidden under the majority’s\n\nreasoning:\n\n   • “Let us pray. . . . Lord this evening we ask you especially to bless [the new\n     fire marshal and police captain]. Fill their hearts Lord with zeal to serve\n     your people, and Lord we ask you to bless us all, that everything we do\n     here tonight will move you to welcome us one day into your kingdom as\n     good and faithful servants.

The beauties of spring—the flowers, the blossoms, the fresh\n  green on the trees, and the warmer weather—are an expressive symbol of\n                                         93\n\f       the new life of the risen Christ.

We pray this evening for the\n       guidance of the Holy Spirit as the Greece Town Board meets.” Id. at *148–\n       50.\n\n       The prayers in Marsh invoked similarly pointed Christian themes, none of which\n\ncaused any constitutional question in the Supreme Court’s view. For example, one\n\nprayer contained the following language:\n\n              Father in heaven, the suffering and death of your son brought life to\n       the whole world moving our hearts to praise your glory. The power of the\n       cross reveals your concern for the world and the wonder of Christ crucified.\n              The days of his life-giving death and glorious resurrection are\n       approaching. This is the hour when he triumphed over Satan’s pride; the\n       time when we celebrate the great event of our redemption.\n              We are reminded of the price he paid when we pray with the\n       Psalmist[,]\n\nat which point the chaplain quoted from Psalm 22. Marsh, 463 U.S. at 823 n.2 (Stevens,\n\nJ., dissenting). And in a prayer offered before Easter one year, the Nebraska chaplain\n\nprayed, “Today as we are about to celebrate the great Holy Days of Christians and Jews,\n\nHoly Week and Passover, let us be reminded again through the faith and beliefs of our\n\nreligions of the principles and directives which should guide us. . . . May these Holy\n\nDays, then, enable us to act as true followers of the beliefs which we have and may it find\n\nexpression in every act and law that is passed.”       Joint Appendix at 108, Marsh v.\n\nChambers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111014\"><a href=\"/opinion/111014/marsh-v-chambers/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983) (No. 82–23), quoted in Snyder, 159 F.3d at 1234 n.11.\n\n       In short, the prayers actually offered in Marsh and Town of Greece contained the\n\nsame sort of pleas to the Christian God and to Jesus Christ, the same recognition of a\n\n\n                                            94\n\fChristian tenet of salvation and dependence on God’s favor, and the same generalized\n\nexhortations to obedience to Christian teachings as those prayers singled out for concern\n\nby the majority. If the prayers in Marsh and Town of Greece did not independently merit\n\nconcern as to content, then neither do the prayers offered in Rowan County.\n\n      Contrary to the majority’s consternation, the prayers in the case at bar do not,\n\ntaken together, reflect a pattern of proselytizing any more than those in Town of Greece\n\nor Marsh. The majority’s examples merely reflect sectarian themes that hew to Christian\n\ndoctrines. Other examples assume that the audience agrees with the prayer givers’ words\n\nor already shares a Christian viewpoint. Proselytization, in contrast, “means to seek to\n\n‘convert’ others to” “a particular religious belief,” Wynne, 376 F.3d at 300, meaning that\n\nit seeks a change from one view to a different one. But the prayers by the commissioners\n\nnever explicitly or implicitly ask the hearers to change beliefs, to adopt as true any\n\nprinciples of the Christian faith, or anything else traditionally understood to be words\n\nimploring conversion. In addition, none of the prayers here threaten damnation to those\n\nof different faiths, belittle or chastise dissenters, or denigrate any other religious\n\nviewpoints. See, e.g., Snyder, 159 F.3d at 1235 (finding the plaintiff’s proffered prayer\n\nunconstitutional because it “strongly disparage[d] other religious views” and “s[ought] to\n\nconvert his audience”).\n\n      Notably, although the majority concludes that the prayers “suggest[ed] that other\n\nfaiths are inferior,” it does not point to any language from the prayers maligning non-\n\nChristian beliefs. See Majority Op. 31. At most, it subjectively intuits the prayers\n\n“implicitly signaled disfavor toward non-Christians” whenever they “portray[ed] the\n\n                                           95\n\ffailure to love Jesus or follow his teachings as spiritual defects.” Majority Op. 31. That\n\nconclusion contradicts Town of Greece’s direct instruction that legislative prayers can be\n\nsectarian, and thus espouse Christian or other faith teachings. Distilled, the majority\n\nholds that any time a legislative prayer contains sectarian language favoring one belief it\n\nimplicitly signals disfavor toward sects that do not adhere to that belief. But that cannot\n\nbe what Town of Greece meant by denigrating other faiths because it expressly held that\n\nsectarian prayers do not cross this line.\n\n       Stripped of these considerations, what remains are passing references in only some\n\nof the prayers at issue that—at worst—merely approach the line drawn in Town of\n\nGreece. Given their paucity against the entire record, however, the prayers in this case\n\neasily meet the test articulated in Town of Greece, which held that a few stray remarks\n\nare insufficient to “despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and embraces our\n\ntradition” of legislative prayers. 134 S. Ct. at 1824. Or, to use Town of Greece’s other\n\nadmonition, even if certain phrases in a handful of prayers are questionable, the practice\n\nat issue as a whole does not show “a pattern of prayers that over time, denigrate,\n\nproselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose,” a legal condition precedent\n\nto any claim of a constitutional violation. Id.\n\n       Nor do the number of sectarian prayers and period of time at issue change the\n\nanalysis. Town of Greece’s reference to a “pattern of prayers . . . over time” must be\n\nunderstood in the context of that case.      The period at issue there was 1999 to 2010,\n\nwhich encompassed some 120 monthly meetings, and for all but the last three years in\n\nthat record, the prayers were offered solely from a Christian tradition. Even during those\n\n                                             96\n\flast three years, only four prayers were given from a non-Christian faith tradition. Id. at\n\n1839 (Breyer, J., dissenting). If those circumstances did not constitute an impermissible\n\npattern of prayers that advanced Christianity or otherwise crossed the line, neither do the\n\nfacts of this case.\n\n       Here, the complaint challenged the Board’s prayer practice from November 2007\n\nthrough March 2013, a much shorter period of time than that covered in Town of Greece,\n\nthough the meetings occurred twice a month rather than monthly. Suppl. J.A. 12–38.\n\nThe majority notes that “97% of the Board’s prayers mention[] ‘Jesus,’ ‘Christ,’ or the\n\n‘Savior.’” Majority Op. 6. Thus, in both Town of Greece and here, the prayers skewed\n\nheavily toward the Christian faith. Yet Greece’s prayer practice was not the ecumenical\n\nutopia the majority paints in order to cast Rowan County’s practice in a more negative\n\nlight. Viewed against the facts of Town of Greece, the Board’s practice crossed no\n\nconstitutional line.\n\n       The same cannot be said of the majority’s review of the Board’s practice: by\n\nengaging in such detailed parsing of both the words of individual prayers and the\n\npercentages of sectarian versus non-sectarian prayers, the majority violates the Supreme\n\nCourt’s instruction that courts should not be the “supervisors and censors of religious\n\nspeech.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1822. In other words, “[o]nce it invites prayer\n\ninto the public sphere, government must permit a prayer giver to address his or her own\n\nGod or gods as conscience dictates, unfettered by what an administrator or judge\n\nconsiders to be nonsectarian.” Id. at 1822–23 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                            97\n\f       The majority appears to prefer the pre-Town of Greece principle that legislative\n\nprayers must consist of generic, nonsectarian prayers that appease the broadest audience\n\nwhile offending the least. E.g., Majority Op. 29 (“[I]n considering whether government\n\nhas aligned itself with a particular religion, a tapestry of many faiths lessens that risk\n\nwhereas invoking only one exacerbates it.”); Majority Op. 32 (“At its best, legislative\n\nprayer gives voice to the ecumenical dimensions of religious faith.”); Majority Op. 38–39\n\n(“The ultimate criterion is simply one of conveying a message of respect and welcome\n\nfor persons of all beliefs and adopting a prayer practice that advances the core idea\n\nbehind legislative prayer, that people of many faiths may be united in a community of\n\ntolerance and devotion.”). The majority’s trouble with the ceremonial legislative prayer\n\nhere thus stems from its disagreement with the basic holding of Town of Greece. But that\n\ndisagreement cannot alter our role, as we are bound to faithfully apply the law articulated\n\nby the Supreme Court. ARA Servs., Inc. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709047\"><a href=\"/opinion/709047/ara-services-incorporated-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138 (4th Cir. 1995)\n\n(Motz, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[D]isagreement provides no basis\n\nfor refusing to follow a directive of the Supreme Court[.]”). That is judicial review run\n\namok, particularly in a context where the Supreme Court has exhorted restraint.\n\n       One of the majority’s recurring themes is that if Rowan County’s legislative\n\nprayer practice is constitutional, there would be no limits to the constitutionality of\n\nlegislative prayer. E.g., Majority Op. 41–43. Not so. As the above analysis observes,\n\nthe Board’s practice adheres to the constitutional limits set out in Marsh and Town of\n\nGreece. This conclusion does not ignore the boundaries both cases set for practices that\n\nwould cross a constitutional line. For example, prayers that implored the audience to\n\n                                            98\n\fattend a particular church would violate Town of Greece’s admonition that a prayer\n\npractice should not, over time, proselytize. Prayers that exhorted the hearers to renounce\n\ntheir faith tradition would similarly transgress this line.       So, too, one can easily\n\nunderstand Town of Greece’s concern that a legislative body could not, in fact, make\n\nofficial decisions based on whether a member of the public participated in, or voiced\n\nopposition to, the legislative prayer practice.    Contrary to the majority’s hyperbole,\n\nconcluding that the prayer practice at issue in this case is constitutional does not leave\n\nTown of Greece’s boundaries meaningless; far from it.\n\n                                             2.\n\n       The majority also finds constitutionally significant that the legislative prayer at\n\nissue here occurs before local government meetings as opposed to state or federal\n\nlegislatures.   See Majority Op. 36–39.       Rather than following Town of Greece’s\n\ninstructive analysis, the majority instead muses about local government meetings as\n\ndifferent than other legislative entities. For example, it notes that “[r]elative to sessions\n\nof Congress and state legislatures, the intimate setting of a municipal board meeting\n\npresents a heightened potential for coercion” because, inter alia, citizens routinely come\n\ndirectly before the board. Majority Op. 36. It also observes that the “Board exercises\n\nboth legislative authority . . . [and] quasi-adjudicatory power.” Majority Op. 36. And it\n\nfears “the intimacy of a town board meeting may push attendees to participate in the\n\nprayer practice in order to avoid the community’s disapproval,” or so “they would not\n\nstand out” just prior to the Board considering their petitions. Majority Op. 38. In so\n\n\n\n                                             99\n\fdoing, the majority draws on an argument posited by the petitioners in Town of Greece\n\nand firmly rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\n       Specifically, in Town of Greece the petitioners asserted that\n\n       the intimate setting of a town board meeting differs in fundamental ways\n       from the invocations delivered in Congress and state legislatures, where the\n       public remains segregated from legislative activity and may not address the\n       body except by occasional invitation. Citizens attend town meetings, on\n       the other hand, to accept awards; speak on matters of local importance; and\n       petition the board for action that may affect their economic interests, such\n       as the granting of permits, business licenses, and zoning variances. . . .\n       [T]he fact that board members in small towns know many of their\n       constituents by name only increases the pressure to conform.\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1824–25 (plurality opinion). In concluding none of these points affected the\n\nconstitutionality of Greece’s prayer practice, the Supreme Court plurality considered both\n\nthe history and purpose of legislative prayer.\n\n       First, the plurality measured legislative prayer “against the backdrop of historical\n\npractice.” Id. at 1825. As discussed above, lawmaker-led legislative prayer is part and\n\nparcel of the same historical roots as legislative prayer more broadly. Infra Sec. III.A.1.\n\nSimilarly, prayers at local government meetings are as historically rooted as prayers at\n\nthe state and federal levels. Id.; see also infra Sec. II (discussing Town of Greece).\n\n       Next, the plurality noted that “[t]he principal audience for these invocations is not,\n\nindeed, the public but lawmakers themselves.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1825\n\n(plurality opinion). In fact, the plurality found that legislative prayer has a particularly\n\nmeaningful personal connection “[f]or members of town boards and commissions, who\n\noften serve part-time and as volunteers,” precisely because it “reflect[s] the values they\n\nhold as private citizens. The prayer is an opportunity for them to show who and what\n\n                                            100\n\fthey are without denying the right to dissent by those who disagree.” Id. at 1826. That\n\nthe Supreme Court lauded the opportunity legislative prayer afforded local lawmakers to\n\nexpress their values highlights the majority’s perplexing conclusion here that prayer\n\npractices at the local level are actually more suspect. For the majority, it’s as if Town of\n\nGreece never happened.\n\n       Of course, this is not to say that legislative prayers cannot be coercive. But as the\n\nTown of Greece plurality recognized, “if town board members directed the public to\n\nparticipate in the prayers, singled out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicated that their\n\ndecisions might be influenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity,” then\n\ncoercion may exist. Id. (emphasis added). But the record here is devoid of those\n\nfeatures.\n\n       For example, the record does not show that the Board ever ordered public\n\nparticipation in its prayer services. Instead, the record presents precisely the sort of\n\nprocedure the Supreme Court approved in Town of Greece. There, “board members\n\nthemselves stood, bowed their heads, or made the sign of the cross during the prayer,\n\n[but] they at no point solicited similar gestures by the public.” Id. There’s no evidence\n\nin the record before this Court that any of the commissioners ever commanded or\n\ndemanded the public audience to rise or bow their heads, make the sign of the cross, or\n\notherwise make any symbol of religious expression during the prayer. And while the\n\nBoard extended the courtesy to those in attendance by inviting them to stand, there’s no\n\nevidence that anyone was required to do so. Tellingly, the Plaintiffs’ own evidence\n\nshows portions of the public audience simply chose not to participate. See J.A. 12\n\n                                            101\n\f(noting only “most” of the audience stood). That a simple invitation to join—which the\n\naudience was free to reject—could be twisted into coerced participation in a religious act\n\ndistorts the record. Instead, lower courts, including this one, must take the Supreme\n\nCourt’s counsel to heart and safely assume that mature adults can follow contextual cues\n\nwithout the risk of religious indoctrination. See Marsh, 463 U.S. at 792; Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1823 (“[A]dult citizens, firm in their own beliefs, can tolerate and perhaps\n\nappreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a person of a different faith.”).\n\n       In Town of Greece, the prayer givers often asked the audience “to rise for the\n\nprayer” by extending invitations such as “Would you bow your heads with me as we\n\ninvite the Lord’s presence here tonight?”; “Let us join our hearts and minds together in\n\nprayer”; and “Would you join me in a moment of prayer?” 134 S. Ct. at 1826 (plurality\n\nopinion).   Here, the designated commissioner would similarly offer a ceremonial\n\ninvocation that typically started with “let us pray” or “please pray with me.” Such\n\ntransitional and prefatory courtesy hardly constitutes coercion under the Supreme Court’s\n\nguidance. No case, before or after Town of Greece, stands for that principle. To the\n\ncontrary, for coercion to be found the government must “orchestrate[] the performance of\n\na formal religious exercise in a fashion that practically obliges the involvement of non-\n\nparticipants.” Myers, 418 F.3d at 406. And in the context of legislative prayer, coercion\n\nmust be measured “against the backdrop of historical practice” in which reasonable\n\nobservers are deemed to be familiar with the tradition and purpose of a ceremonial prayer\n\nto open a legislative session. Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1825 (plurality opinion).\n\nViewed through that lens, no reasonable person would interpret a commissioner’s\n\n                                            102\n\fcommonplace and “almost reflexive” opening line of “let us pray” to compel their\n\nsubmission to the prayer. Cf. id. at 1832 (Alito, J., concurring). Such standard openings\n\nhave been routinely offered for over two centuries in the U.S. Congress, the state\n\nlegislatures, and countless local bodies. In short, such innocuous language cannot be\n\nwhat the Supreme Court contemplated when it expressed concern about prayer givers\n\n“direct[ing] the public to participate in the prayers.” Id. at 1826 (plurality opinion).\n\n       Plaintiffs, the district court, and the majority assert that the Board’s prayer practice\n\nmade audience members feel subjectively “excluded at meetings” and that the Board’s\n\n“disagreement with [their] public opposition to sectarian prayer could make [them] less\n\neffective advocate[s].” See Lund, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 715–16. This is a failed argument.\n\nTown of Greece explicitly rejected the same claim that perceived “subtle pressure to\n\nparticipate in prayers that violate their beliefs in order to please the board members from\n\nwhom they are about to seek a favorable ruling” constitutes coercion. 134 S. Ct. at 1825\n\n(plurality opinion). Merely exposing constituents to prayer they may find offensive is not\n\nenough. “[I]n the general course[,] legislative bodies do not engage in impermissible\n\ncoercion merely by exposing constituents to prayer they would rather not hear and in\n\nwhich they need not participate.” Id. at 1827.\n\n       Nor did the Board’s prayer practice “chastise[] dissenters []or attempt[] lengthy\n\ndisquisition on religious dogma.” Id. at 1826. Rather, as illustrated above, the prayer\n\ncontent largely followed the spirit of solemn, respectful prayer approved in Marsh and\n\nTown of Greece. Moreover, the record shows that both attendance and participation in\n\nthe invocations were voluntary. The Board has represented without contradiction that\n\n                                             103\n\fmembers of the public were free “to remain seated or to otherwise disregard the\n\nInvocation in a manner that [was] not disruptive.” J.A. 277. Thus, as a practical matter,\n\ncitizens attending a Board meeting who found the prayers objectionable were not without\n\nrecourse; they could arrive after the invocation, leave for the duration of the prayer, or\n\nremain for the prayer without participating, just like the audiences in Marsh and Town of\n\nGreece. To the extent individuals like Plaintiffs elected to stay, “their quiet acquiescence\n\n[would] not, in light of our traditions, be interpreted as an agreement with the words or\n\nideas expressed.” Town of Greece, 134 S. Ct. at 1827 (plurality opinion).\n\n       By suggesting that audience members should not be required to arrive “after the\n\nprayer, leave the room before the prayer, or simply stay seated” because doing so “served\n\nonly to marginalize,” Majority Op. 38, the majority rejects the precise actions the\n\nSupreme Court approved in Town of Greece. 134 S. Ct. at 1827 (plurality opinion)\n\n(“Nothing in the record suggests that members of the public are dissuaded from leaving\n\nthe meeting room during the prayer, arriving late, or even, as happened here, making a\n\nlater protest. In this case, as in Marsh, board members and constituents are free to enter\n\nand leave with little comment and for any number of reasons. Should nonbelievers\n\nchoose to exit the room during a prayer they find distasteful, their absence will not stand\n\nout as disrespectful or even noteworthy.          And should they remain, their quiet\n\nacquiescence will not, in light of our traditions, be interpreted as an agreement with the\n\nwords or ideas expressed. Neither choice represents an unconstitutional imposition as to\n\nmature adults[.]”).\n\n\n\n                                            104\n\f       The record is similarly devoid of evidence that anyone who chose not to\n\nparticipate during the prayer suffered adverse consequences, that their absence was\n\nperceived as disrespectful or was recognized by the Board in any way. To the contrary,\n\nthe Board has attested, again without contradiction, that such conduct would have “no\n\nimpact on [the constituent’s] right to fully participate in the public meeting, including\n\naddressing the commission and participating in the agenda items in the same manner as\n\npermitted any citizen of Rowan County.” J.A. 277. Plaintiffs point us to no evidence to\n\nthe contrary. Thus, it is implausible on this record to suggest that Plaintiffs were “in a\n\nfair and real sense” coerced to participate in the exercise of legislative prayer. Lee, 505\n\nU.S. at 586. In short, there’s no evidence that “town leaders allocated benefits and\n\nburdens based on participation in the prayer, or that citizens were received differently\n\ndepending on whether they joined the invocation or quietly declined.” Town of Greece,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1826 (plurality opinion).\n\n       As it must do given the record, the majority concedes that it is not “suggest[ing]\n\nthat the commissioners made decisions based on whether an attendee participated in the\n\nprayers.” Majority Op. 37. Nonetheless, the majority divines constitutional jeopardy in\n\nthe juxtaposition of ceremonial prayer immediately prior to Board business. See Majority\n\nOp. 37. That distinction lacks meaning given that legislative prayer is a ceremonial\n\nprayer practice that occurs at the start of a legislative meeting where a legislative body\n\npresumably intends to engage in legislative work. More to the point, Rowan County’s\n\nmeeting process is precisely that approved by the Supreme Court in Town of Greece. 134\n\nS. Ct. at 1823 (“The relevant constraint derives from [the prayer’s] place at the opening\n\n                                           105\n\fof legislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values\n\nlong part of the Nation’s heritage.”).\n\n       Significantly, at no time did the Supreme Court in Town of Greece suggest that\n\nlegislative prayers at a local government meeting inherently presented any constitutional\n\nissue. Yet the innate qualities of local government meetings are where the majority\n\ndirects its concerns. E.g., Majority Op. 36 (“[T]he intimate setting of a municipal board\n\nmeeting presents a heightened potential for coercion.”); Majority Op. 36 (“[T]he\n\ncommissioners consider[] citizen petitions shortly after the invocation,” and “the Board\n\nexercises both legislative authority over questions of general public importance as well as\n\na quasi-adjudicatory power over such granular issues as zoning petitions, permit\n\napplications, and contract awards.”); Majority Op. 38 (“[T]he intimacy of a town board\n\nmeeting may push attendees to participate in the prayer practice in order to avoid the\n\ncommunity’s disapproval.”). If any of these inherent characteristics conflicted with the\n\nFirst Amendment, it would have been addressed in the Supreme Court’s decision in Town\n\nof Greece because those circumstances were squarely part of that case and those\n\narguments were made to the Court. But the Supreme Court rejected those claims, and the\n\nmajority plainly errs by rejecting the course laid out by the Supreme Court.\n\n       Drawing on distinctions noted in Justice Alito’s concurring and Justice Kagan’s\n\ndissenting opinions in Town of Greece, the majority also cobbles together a distinction\n\nbetween prayers offered before the totality of a local governmental meeting and those\n\nsaid before a legislative portion of the meeting as distinct from an adjudicatory phase of\n\nthe meeting. Majority Op. 36–37. But the majority in Town of Greece relied on no such\n\n                                            106\n\fdemarcation. The only relevant point in terms of order was that legislative prayer has\n\nhistorically been offered—as it was in Marsh and Town of Greece—at the “opening of\n\nlegislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values\n\nlong part of the Nation’s heritage” and “invite[] lawmakers to reflect upon shared ideals\n\nand common ends before they embark on the fractious business of governing.” Town of\n\nGreece, 134 S. Ct. at 1823. The legislative prayers here similarly occur at the opening of\n\nthe Board’s meeting as part of the ceremonial part of the meeting that also includes the\n\nPledge of Allegiance. It occurs before any Board business, whether adjudicative or\n\nlegislative. The majority’s quibble finds no support in Town of Greece’s holding.\n\n       Because the Supreme Court has already rejected the concerns about the intimacy\n\nof legislative prayer before a local government meeting, that factor has no bearing on the\n\nconstitutionality of Rowan County’s practice. But the equally troubling result is that the\n\nrest of the majority’s analysis applies with the same force to local, state, and federal\n\nlegislatures. It will no doubt come as a surprise to members of the United States House\n\nof Representatives and Senate to learn that neither Marsh nor Town of Greece protect\n\ntheir right to offer legislative prayer.\n\n\n\n                                           IV.\n\n       Make no mistake, while the majority purports to have no problem with the idea of\n\nlawmaker-led legislative prayer in the abstract, its reasoning actually leaves no room for\n\nlawmakers to engage in the full panoply of legislative prayer practices to which Town of\n\nGreece grants constitutional protection. The lawmaker’s mere status as a prayer giver is\n\n                                           107\n\fviewed with immediate skepticism, and any sectarian content to his or her prayers is\n\ndeemed to have an added coercive effect. Moreover, the majority refrains from providing\n\nany guidelines as to when, if ever, lawmaker-led legislative prayers can meet their newly\n\nminted constitutional standards. Majority Op. 38–39. Indeed, the only safe practice for\n\nlawmakers who want to offer a legislative prayer is to ignore what Marsh and Town of\n\nGreece permit and offer only a generic prayer to a generic god.\n\n       The Rowan County legislative prayer practice falls within the historical traditions\n\nrecognized in Marsh and Town of Greece and the principles the Supreme Court\n\narticulated in both cases. It is constitutional.\n\n       For all these reasons, I would reverse the district court’s judgment and enter final\n\njudgment for Rowan County. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                              108\n\f</pre>",
