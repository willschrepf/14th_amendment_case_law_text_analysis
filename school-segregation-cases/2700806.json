In four issues, Gaylord contends the trial court erred by entering JNOV\r\nin favor of Action Box, Inc. (\"Action Box\") because (1) there is more than a scintilla\r\nof evidence that Action Box committed the first material breach of the Settlement\r\nAgreement at issue, causing Gaylord to sustain damages; (2) the evidence\r\nconclusively supports a judgment in Gaylord's favor on its \"benefit of the bargain\"\r\ndamages; (3) the evidence conclusively supports a judgment</span><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong> </strong></span><span></span><span>for Gaylord on its\r\ndamages resulting from Action Box's failure to complete the Discount Program; and\r\n(4) Action Box failed to present legally sufficient evidence that it complied with the\r\ncontractually obligated procedure for ordering products.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellee, Action Box, contends that the trial court erred by failing to award\r\nAction Box its attorney's fees for appeal.  Further, Action Box asserts a conditional\r\ncross-point arguing that the trial court erred by ruling that, as a matter of law, the\r\nSettlement Agreement only obligated Gaylord to fill Action Box's orders that were\r\nfor products that Gaylord offered and sold to the market in general.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe reverse the trial court's entry of JNOV and enter judgment in favor of\r\nGaylord in the amount of $5,070.00.\t</span><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tAction Box manufactures corrugated cardboard boxes.  Gaylord is a supplier\r\nof raw material from which such boxes are made.  Gaylord's Bogalusa, Louisiana\r\nplant (\"Bogalusa\") produces bulk boxes as well as other cardboard-related materials. \r\nThe plant's primary product is laminated cardboard boxes, a specialty product\r\nmanufactured by only a few other competitors.  The cardboard products produced by\r\nBogalusa vary according to their composition, weight and strength, and are made of\r\nvarious combinations of cardboard components (</span><span><em></em></span><span>i.e</span><span></span><span>., walls, sheets, fluting).  Bogalusa\r\nbases its pricing upon the cost of goods sold as well as upon the distance to the\r\ncustomer, and the market to which it sells varies according to the product produced.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAction Box was a customer of Bogalusa, primarily purchasing solid fiber\r\nmaterial to manufacture boxes.  </span><span></span><span>Eighty percent of the cardboard materials Action Box\r\nuses are single-walled sheets of cardboard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span><strong><em><span>The Parties' Initial Dispute Leads to a Settlement Agreement</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t In 2003, Gaylord filed a lawsuit against Action Box in Louisiana (the\r\n\"Louisiana Lawsuit\"), in which Gaylord alleged that Action Box owed it $54,533.24\r\nfor four orders of solid fiber cardboard in January and March 2003.  Shortly\r\nthereafter, Action Box filed a reciprocal lawsuit suit against Gaylord in Harris\r\nCounty, Texas (the \"Texas Lawsuit\"), alleging that the cardboard it purchased in\r\nJanuary and March 2003 from Gaylord was pitted and thus defective, causing Action\r\nBox to incur significant damages.  Action Box alleged violations of the Texas\r\nDeceptive Trade Practices Act and that Gaylord negligently represented the quality\r\nof its products.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn May 2004, the parties mediated their dispute regarding the pitted cardboard\r\nand reached an agreement by which Action Box would pay Gaylord $54,533.24 by\r\nJune 15, 2004, and Gaylord, upon receiving such payment, would grant Action Box\r\na 5% discount on certain of its products, up to a total discount of $70,000 (the\r\n\"Discount Program\").  Jim McIntyre, Gaylord's sales manager at the time, testified\r\nthat this was the first such Discount Program Gaylord had ever entered into.  On June\r\n1, 2004, Action Box attempted to place its first order taking advantage of the\r\nDiscount Program.  The order was for a large quantity of single wall sheets--a\r\nproduct that the Gaylord Bogalusa plant did not generally sell and that it had not\r\npreviously sold to Action Box.  The order was rejected by Gaylord.  McIntyre stated\r\nthat the order was rejected because the Gaylord Bogalusa facility, \"as a general rule,\"\r\ndid not produce single wall sheets in the quantity ordered by Action Box because the\r\nplant was \"not equipped to handle\" the order.  McIntyre testified that Action Box was\r\nverbally informed that Gaylord would not fill the order for single wall sheets on the\r\ngrounds that single wall sheets were not usually produced by the Bogalusa plant.  At\r\ntrial, McIntyre testified that, due to the process of manufacturing and the size of the\r\nmachines at issue, only 1/100th of the Bogalusa plant's output was single wall sheets. \r\nMcIntyre testified that the small quantities of single wall sheet that were produced\r\nwent to four customers, and that most of it was sent to local customers.  McIntyre\r\nexplained that these sales were \"special deals\" to accommodate these customers and\r\nthat Gaylord sold only a small quantity of single wall board to each of these\r\ncustomers.  McIntyre further testified that much of the single wall material sold was\r\ntaken out of overrun from other products.  Rick Bailey, a salesman for Gaylord, also\r\ntestified that it was \"very difficult\" to handle sales of single wall sheets and that it\r\nwas not the normal course of Gaylord's business to do so.  Bailey also testified that\r\nBogalusa did not sell single wall sheets in the quantities ordered by Action Box.  At\r\ntrial, purchase orders and testimony showed that Bogalusa sold single wall sheets to\r\nother companies during 2004, but that these sales were in smaller quantities than the\r\norders placed by Action Box.  McIntyre testified that, if Action Box had ordered a\r\nquantity of single wall sheets that he could fill from his overrun supplies, then he\r\nwould have filled the order.  McIntyre also described that, in the Bogalusa\r\nmanufacturing process, the plant's ability to produce a particular product at a\r\nparticular price depended upon the dimensions of the sheets ordered as well as the\r\ntotal square footage of the order.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, Gaylord faxed the June 1, 2006 order back to Action Box with\r\nthe following notation: \"Please process through Texas Sheets. Orders not to be\r\nprocessed through Bogalusa Plant until paid in full by the proposed due date of June\r\n15, 2004.\"  Texas Sheets is a San Antonio facility owned by Gaylord's parent\r\ncompany, Temple-Inland.  Texas Sheets is a \"sheet plant\" and one of its products is\r\nsingle wall sheets, although not the specialty heavy weight single wall sheets that the\r\nBogalusa plant can produce.  The fax did not inform Action Box that Bogalusa did\r\nnot manufacture single wall sheets in the quantity Action Box sought.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn mid-June 2004, Action Box and Gaylord formalized their settlement by\r\nexecuting the Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (\"Settlement Agreement\").\r\nThe Settlement Agreement stated its purpose was to settle the Texas and the\r\nLouisiana Lawsuits because both parties wished to \"avoid further time, expense and\r\nthe uncertaint[ies] involved in the lawsuit[s].\"  Action Box agreed to pay Gaylord\r\n$54,533.24 to settle the Louisiana Lawsuit in exchange for Gaylord's agreement that\r\nit would \"release and forever discharge Action Box from any claim asserted or which\r\ncould have been asserted in the Louisiana Action\" and an agreement that Gaylord\r\nwould \"dismiss, with prejudice, the Louisiana Action.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs to the Texas Lawsuit, the parties formalized the agreed-upon \"Discount\r\nProgram\" under which Action Box would receive a 5% discount on all of its\r\npurchases of solid fiber, solid fiber boxes, triple wall, double wall and single wall\r\nproducts from the Inland Gaylord-Bogalusa Plant, up to a total discount of $70,000. \r\nThe parties agreed that they would \"in good faith . . . attempt to complete\" the full\r\nDiscount Program by November 30, 2004, but they also agreed that the Discount\r\nProgram would last until the full benefits had been received by Action Box.  The\r\nSettlement Agreement stated</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>The prices for the goods (prior to the discount) being sold by Gaylord\r\nto Action Box pursuant to this settlement shall be competitive and\r\npegged to the current prices being paid by Action Box for the same\r\ngoods which Action Box purchases from competitors of Gaylord.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>Action Box also agreed that it would \"release and forever discharge Gaylord from any\r\nclaims asserted or which could have been asserted in the Texas Action\" and that it\r\nwould \"dismiss, with prejudice, the Texas Action.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAction Box paid Gaylord $54,533.24 in mid-June 2004, as it had promised in\r\nthe Settlement Agreement.  Action Box did not, however, file a non-suit or notice of\r\ndismissal of the Texas Lawsuit. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn late June and early July 2004, Action Box placed more orders with Gaylord,\r\nagain ordering a large quantity of single wall sheets.  Gaylord refused to fill these\r\norders, this time returning the orders via fax with the following notes: \"Send to Texas\r\nSheets.  Not run in Bogalusa\" and \"Not for Bogalusa-We don't run for you. Send to\r\nTexas Sheets.\"  McIntyre testified that Action Box appeared to be ordering \"multiple\r\ntruckloads\" of single-walled sheets, and that he had informed Action Box that the\r\nsingle wall product it was ordering was something that the Bogalusa plant did not\r\nnormally produce.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring the summer, Action Box also ordered a quantity of double-walled and\r\ntriple-walled sheets, but paid less than the quoted price for the double-walled sheets. \r\nMcIntyre testified that he had charged Action Box a previously quoted price and that\r\nhe had not \"pegged\" the price to the current prices Action Box may have been paying\r\nother suppliers because Action Box did not provide verification of those prices. \r\nMcIntyre also admitted that he was not aware of the particulars of the Discount\r\nProgram at the time, but he testified that if Action Box had provided him with\r\ndocumentation of competitor's prices and informed him of the Discount Program\r\nparticulars, he would have lowered the quoted prices accordingly.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDespite these ongoing disputes, Action Box continued to place orders for\r\nvarious products, including double wall and triple wall cardboard.  Action Box placed\r\norders for products on October 12, 2004, and another on January 14, 2005.  On\r\nJanuary 21, 2005, Don Sparaco, the plant manager for the Bogalusa plant, wrote a\r\nletter to Action Box informing it that Bogalusa could not produce the requested sizes\r\nof double wall sheets at the price Action Box specified:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>We received a fax order from your company for various size double wall\r\nsheets and relayed that we would be happy to process this order through\r\nour Texas Sheets operation. Unfortunately, unless we had overruns\r\navailable from orders for converted boxes, Bogalusa could not sell the\r\nordered products at the prices indicated on your order form. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span>\t. . . .  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span>We are willing to produce the products you ordered, but at higher prices\r\nthan indicated on your order form.  Of course, you would receive the 5%\r\ndiscount off of our prices, per our Settlement Agreement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>Action Box continued to send orders for products and quantities that Bogalusa did not\r\nnormally produce.  Sparaco sent another letter to Action Box on March 28, 2005,\r\nstating:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>As a member of the solid fiber/corrugated paper industry, you know that\r\nthe Bogalusa plant['s] manufacturing and packaging capabilities are\r\nincompatible with your order. . . . Additionally, you are submitting blind\r\norders for products, with prices already specified.  You know . . . this is\r\nnot the way we operate.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>This lawsuit has created a strange situation.  Action Box is now ordering\r\nproducts under the settlement agreement that you never ordered from\r\nthis facility before and which you know the facility cannot fulfill.  You\r\nare also submitting orders differently than before.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>We are ready to sell to Action Box products sold from this facility in the\r\nordinary course of business, at a competitive price discounted by the\r\nagreed upon five percent.  However, we cannot sell Action Box products\r\nwe do not ourselves sell in the ordinary course of our business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span><strong>Additional Litigation Arises out of the Settlement Agreement</strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn late summer and fall of 2004, while Gaylord and Action Box were\r\nexchanging correspondence regarding the above orders, they were also filing new\r\nclaims and suits against each other.  On August 6, 2004, Gaylord filed a new lawsuit\r\nin Louisiana, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Settlement Agreement did not\r\nrequire it to sell Action Box single wall sheets.  On September 9, 2004, Action Box\r\nfiled its \"First Amended Original Petition\" in the Texas Lawsuit, which it had never\r\ndismissed despite its agreement to do so--with prejudice--in the Settlement\r\nAgreement.  Action Box later added claims for breach of contract, alleging that the\r\nagreement reached between the parties at mediation and the Settlement Agreement\r\nconstituted one, single agreement, and that Gaylord had failed to comply with the\r\nterms of that agreement by failing to fill Action Box's June 1, 2004 order for single\r\nwall sheets and that Gaylord \"further indicated it would never sell single wall sheets\r\nto Action Box.\"  In addition, Action Box alleged that Gaylord had breached its\r\nagreement to sell products to Action Box at prices that were \"pegged to the current\r\nprices being paid by Action Box for the same goods which Action Box purchase[d]\r\nfrom competitors of Gaylord,\" and that Gaylord \"failed to act in good faith to\r\ncomplete sales contemplated by the agreement.\"  Action Box sought to recover\r\ndamages and attorney's fees based upon Gaylord's alleged breaches.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGaylord counterclaimed, alleging that Action Box had failed to act in \"good\r\nfaith\" to place enough orders to complete the Discount Program.  Gaylord alleged that\r\nAction Box had breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to dismiss the Texas\r\nLawsuit, by opposing abatement of the Texas Lawsuit, and by continuing to prosecute\r\nthe Texas Lawsuit.  Gaylord also alleged that Action Box's failure to place enough\r\norders to complete the Discount Program violated the Settlement Agreement. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAction Box raised the affirmative defenses of anticipatory repudiation, prior\r\nmaterial breach, and failure of consideration. Action Box also alleged that Gaylord\r\nhad failed to mitigate its own damages.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGaylord pled the affirmative defenses of estoppel and failure of consideration. \r\nIn addition, Gaylord asserted that Chapter 154 of the Texas Civil Practice and\r\nRemedies Code barred any recovery by Action Box and that Action Box had\r\njudicially admitted that it could have fulfilled its obligations under the Discount\r\nProgram within one year of the Settlement Agreement.  Gaylord also argued that\r\nAction Box was not entitled to its attorney's fees because it had not complied with\r\nthe requirements of Section 38.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBefore the case went to trial, Gaylord obtained a ruling from the trial court\r\nconstruing the Settlement Agreement to mean that Gaylord's obligation to sell\r\nproducts to Action Box was limited to those products and quantities that the Gaylord-Bogalusa facility actually offered, produced, and otherwise sold to the market in\r\ngeneral.  That order is not part of the clerk's record in this appeal.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span><strong><em><span>The Evidence at Trial</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring trial, Action Box presented evidence that, over the course of 2004,\r\nBogalusa quoted and sold a large quantity of single wall and double wall sheets to\r\nother companies, but that Gaylord refused to fill Action Box's June and July orders\r\nfor what Action Box claimed was a similar product.  McIntyre testified that the\r\nproducts sold to these customers and the products requested by Action Box were\r\nsubstantially different, and that Bogalusa did not generally offer the single wall\r\nproducts ordered by Action Box in 2004.  Further, both Bailey and McIntyre testified\r\nthat Action Box requested a much larger quantity of product than the other customers. \r\nBrett Camp, purchasing manager for Action Box, testified that Gaylord had never told\r\nAction Box it had a minimum or maximum order for any of its products.  Further,\r\nCamp testified that he had never been told, prior to the rejection of the June 1, 2004\r\norder, that Bogalusa did not manufacture and sell single wall sheets to the general\r\nmarket.  Instead, Camp testified that he placed the single wall order with Bogalusa\r\njust as he would have with Action Box's other suppliers, and that he continued to\r\nplace the order despite Gaylord's refusal to fill it.  Camp testified that he placed an\r\norder for double wall sheets at a price he confirmed with McIntyre, contradicting\r\nMcIntyre's testimony that the order was not paid in full.  Camp stated that Action Box\r\ncontinued to place orders, in good faith, with Gaylord to fulfill the Discount Program\r\nbut that the companies continued to disagree about the prices to be paid for double\r\nwall sheets and whether Bogalusa was obligated to fill Action Box's orders for single\r\nwall sheets.  Camp also testified that Action Box's quick turnaround time on orders\r\nmeant that he did not have time to negotiate with a supplier on an unfavorable price,\r\nbut that he instead would then take the order to another supplier for a better price. \r\nCamp confirmed that, over 11 and a half months, Action Box ordered a sufficient\r\nquantity of materials from other suppliers to fulfill its obligations under the Discount\r\nProgram and that, had Bogalusa sold it single wall products, Action Box would have\r\nplaced these orders through Bogalusa.  According to Camp, Gaylord never informed\r\nAction Box that it could only fill orders of single wall products in the amounts it\r\ngenerally made available to other customers, nor did Action Box know the amount\r\nof single wall sheet Gaylord generally made available to other customers.  Camp\r\nstated that he would have accepted an offer from Bogalusa to partially fill the orders\r\nAction Box placed, and he still intended, as late as February 2005, to place orders\r\nunder the Discount Program.  Other Action Box representatives confirmed Action\r\nBox's intention to continue to place orders under the Discount Program, regardless\r\nof the ongoing disputes with Gaylord.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDon Sparaco testified on behalf of Gaylord, estimating that Gaylord had\r\nsuffered $398,400 in lost profits as a result of Action Box's failure to complete the\r\nDiscount Program by purchasing the required amount of $1,400,000 in products from\r\nthe Bogalusa facility.  Sparaco's estimate was based upon a general 8.46% profit\r\nmargin for the facility, which would have amounted to $48,440 in profits upon\r\n$1,400,000 in sales, less the $70,000 in discounts promised to Action Box.  Sparaco\r\ntestified that the profit margin depended upon the product ordered, and that 8.46%\r\nwas a conservative estimate of the profit Gaylord could have expected.  In addition,\r\nSparaco asserted that Gaylord's mill, which supplied Bogalusa with its raw materials,\r\nalso suffered damages of $350,000 in profits lost from sales to the Bogalusa facility\r\ndue to Action Box's failure to complete the Discount Program.  In total, Sparaco\r\ntestified that Gaylord suffered $397,388 in lost profits. Sparaco was cross-examined\r\non his damages model, and admitted that he had not included a possible 2% discount\r\nfor payments within 20 days.  Sparaco also admitted that, even if Action Box had not\r\nplaced orders for particular products, Gaylord could have used the raw materials and\r\nresources at issue to fulfill other customers' orders at full price, thus reducing its\r\ndamages.  Finally, Sparaco stated that he did not know the profit margin on single\r\nwall sheets.  None of the testifying Gaylord employees stated that they ever informed\r\nAction Box that Bogalusa could supply it with smaller quantities of single wall\r\nproduct from its overrun supplies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBoth sides offered the testimony of their trial attorneys regarding the fees their\r\nclients accrued in prosecution and defense of the lawsuit.  Martin Shellist, Action\r\nBox's trial counsel, testified at length regarding the fees incurred by his client. \r\nShellist testified that the case, pending since 2004, was a complex commercial case\r\ninvolving legal issues that required the trial court's intervention.  Shellist briefly\r\ndescribed his involvement in the mediation and ensuing revival of litigation between\r\nAction Box and Gaylord, describing it as a \"shame; a crying shame.\"  Shellist\r\ntestified that, in his opinion, the fees Action Box incurred were reasonable and\r\nnecessary, and that the fees through trial were estimated to be over $290,000.  Shellist\r\nalso testified that he believed appellate fees would total over $135,000.  Shellist was\r\ncross-examined by Gaylord's attorneys about the segregation of his firm's work on\r\nvarious causes of action and defenses raised by Action Box during the lawsuit.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGaylord's trial counsel, John Newton, III, also testified about the fees his client\r\nincurred.  Newton testified about fees and costs Gaylord incurred to (1) defeat Action\r\nBox's claim for the defective materials it ordered in 2003; (2) prosecute its\r\ncounterclaim against Action Box for failing to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit as it had\r\npromised in the Settlement Agreement; and (3) prosecute its second counterclaim\r\nagainst Action Box for failing to complete the Discount Program in good faith.  The\r\ntotal amount, including estimated trial time, was $373,701.40.  Newton testified that\r\nGaylord was not seeking to recover the fees it incurred in defending itself against\r\nAction Box's breach of contract claim.  Like Shellist, Newton also testified that the\r\ncase was complicated and time-intensive.  Newton also testified that he believed\r\nattorney's fees could reasonably exceed the amount of damages in controversy\r\nbecause \"[Y]ou can't stop working.  You have to do the work.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNewton also stated that the fees incurred to defeat Action Box's claim for\r\ndefective solid fiber board were incurred because Action Box failed to honor its\r\ncommitment to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit with prejudice.  According to Newton,\r\nAction Box's attorneys drafted a proposed dismissal with prejudice of the Texas\r\nLawsuit, circulated it to Gaylord, but never filed it.  Newton testified that Action Box\r\ninstead continued to seek damages relating to the solid fiber board dispute into the\r\nfall of 2004, and that it was his professional opinion that it was necessary for Gaylord\r\nto actively seek the Court's intervention and have that claim dismissed from the\r\nlitigation.  Newton testified that he filed special exceptions and sent discovery\r\nrequests to determine whether Action Box was indeed continuing to seek damages\r\nrelated to the pitted fiber board, and that he filed a motion for summary judgment on\r\nGaylord's behalf to finally resolve the issue.  According to Newton, all of these\r\nactions caused Gaylord to incur attorney's fees and costs.  On cross-examination,\r\nNewton agreed that, even though Gaylord had expended a sum of money in seeing\r\nthat Action Box's claims regarding the defective fiber board were finally dismissed,\r\nand it was his opinion that these actions were necessary to protect Gaylord's interests,\r\nthe jury was the ultimate decision maker as to whether those fees were reasonably\r\nnecessary.  Newton was cross-examined regarding his segregation of fees and his\r\ncontention that some categories of both Action Box's and Gaylord's attorneys' fees\r\nwere not recoverable as a matter of law in the case.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRobert M. Roach, Jr., another of Gaylord's attorneys, also testified regarding\r\nGaylord's attorney's fees.  Roach specifically stated that all of the attorney's fees\r\nGaylord incurred in order to get summary judgment were a direct result of Action\r\nBox's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit.  Roach also testified that a distinction\r\nexisted between Action Box's decision not to prosecute its defective product claims\r\nin the Texas Lawsuit further and a dismissal of those claims and suit with prejudice.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>[Counsel for Action Box:] Just having a case on file somewhere, does\r\nnot necessarily cause a party to have any damages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\t[Roach:] I disagree with that completely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span>[Counsel for Action Box:] Okay.

Spalding testified that he believed Action Box had made\r\na strategic decision not to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit, even though it had agreed to do\r\nso in the Settlement Agreement, so that the Texas Lawsuit would remain in force in\r\ncase Gaylord sought to file a Louisiana Lawsuit over any disputes that might arise\r\nunder the Discount Program.  Spalding based this opinion on statements made in\r\nAction Box's bills for its attorneys' time, which revealed that Action Box's attorneys\r\nconducted research on the \"first filed rule\"--a rule courts generally follow when two\r\nlawsuits are filed in different forums, requiring the latter-filed suit to stop and wait\r\nfor the resolution of the earlier suit.</span><span></span><span><sup> (1)</sup></span><span></span><span></span><span>  Spalding also generally opined as to the\r\nnecessity and reasonableness of the fees in the case, stating that Action Box's fees\r\nappeared to be too high and include mistaken entries and some double-invoicing and\r\nthat Gaylord's fees appeared to be generally reasonable, with the exception of some\r\nmistaken entries. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span>The Jury's Verdict</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, the jury found that both Gaylord and Action Box had breached the\r\nSettlement Agreement. The jury found that Gaylord breached the Settlement\r\nAgreement by, on October 14, 2004 and January 14, 2005, failing to peg its prices to\r\nthe then-current prices being paid by Action Box for the same goods that Action Box\r\npurchased from competitors.  The jury found that Gaylord's breach of the Settlement\r\nAgreement was material, and assessed benefit of the bargain damages for Action Box\r\nof $13,378.27.  The jury awarded Action Box $158,696.97 in attorney's fees for\r\npreparation and trial, but did not award any attorney's fees for appeal.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury also found that Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit was\r\na material breach of the Settlement Agreement, and awarded Gaylord $5,070 as\r\ndamages for the cost of defending the lawsuit after Action Box failed to dismiss it. \r\nThe jury did not award Gaylord any additional attorney's fees.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury was specifically asked which party failed to comply with the\r\nSettlement Agreement first.  The jury found that Action Box had been the first to fail\r\nto comply with the Settlement Agreement.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span>The Trial Court Enters JNOV</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em>Gaylord's Motion for JNOV</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the jury's verdict, Gaylord moved for entry of judgment based on the\r\njury's verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  Gaylord asked the court\r\nto enter judgment in accordance with the jury's answers to Questions 13 and 16--\r\nthat Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit was a material breach of the\r\nSettlement Agreement, and that Action Box was the party that first breached the\r\nSettlement Agreement.  Further, Gaylord argued that the jury's answers to Questions\r\n2 and 3--that Gaylord had failed to comply with the Settlement Agreement by\r\nrefusing to peg its prices in accordance with the Agreement--should be disregarded\r\nin light of the jury's findings that Action Box committed the first material breach of\r\nthe Settlement Agreement.  Alternatively, Gaylord argued that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to support the jury's answer to Questions 2 and 3.  Based upon its\r\narguments that the jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3 should be disregarded,\r\nGaylord also argued that Action Box was not entitled to recover its attorney's fees. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGaylord also asked the trial court to enter judgment in accordance with the\r\njury's answers to Questions 1, 4, and 5--that Gaylord had not breached the\r\nSettlement Agreement by not filling orders Action Box placed on July 6, 2004; March\r\n22, 2005; October 12, 2005.</span><span></span><span><sup> (2)</sup></span><span></span><span></span><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to seeking judgment based upon the jury's answers that Action Box\r\nhad been the first to breach the Settlement Agreement, and that Action Box had\r\nmaterially breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to dismiss the Texas\r\nLawsuit, Gaylord asked the trial court to award it more damages than the jury had\r\nawarded as damages for Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit.  Instead\r\nof the $5,070 awarded by the jury for Action Box's failure to dismiss the lawsuit,\r\nGaylord argued that the evidence conclusively established it suffered damages in the\r\namount of $463,055.76--$65,667.76 in fees and costs related to the lawsuit and\r\n$397,388 in benefit of the bargain damages lost as a result of Action Box's failure to\r\nfulfill its purchasing obligations under the Settlement Agreement.  Similarly, Gaylord\r\nasked the court to enter judgment notwithstanding the jury's answer to Question\r\n15--that, despite Action Box's material breach and Gaylord's damages, Gaylord was\r\nnot entitled to any attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Gaylord asked the trial court to disregard the jury's answer to Question\r\n19--that Action Box had not failed to comply with its obligation under the Settlement\r\nAgreement to make a good faith effort to complete the Discount Program by\r\nNovember 30, 2004 or a reasonable date thereafter.  Instead, Gaylord argued that it\r\nwas entitled to judgment that Action Box had not acted in good faith under the\r\nSettlement Agreement and that it was also entitled to receive its benefit of the bargain\r\ndamages and attorney's fees.\t\t</span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em>Action Box's Motion for JNOV</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAction Box also moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  Action Box\r\nargued that, while the jury found that Action Box was the first to breach the\r\nSettlement Agreement, that the breach was not material and therefore did not excuse\r\nGaylord's performance under the Discount Program.  Accordingly, Action Box\r\nargued that it was entitled to judgment in its favor on its breach of contract claims\r\nagainst Gaylord.  Further, Action Box argued that it was entitled to the full measure\r\nof its alleged benefit of the bargain damages--more than the $13,378.27 awarded by\r\nthe jury.  Instead, Action Box moved for an award of $69,378.27--the unused amount\r\nof the $70,000 discount that Gaylord promised in the Settlement Agreement.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span>Final Judgment</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court entered judgment in favor of Action Box, awarding  $69,378.27\r\nfor Gaylord's breach of the Settlement Agreement and $158,696.97 in attorney's fees\r\nand costs for preparation and trial.  The trial court did not award any attorney's fees\r\non appeal.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGaylord filed a motion for new trial.

In Question 16, the jury was asked, \"Who failed to comply with the\r\nSettlement Agreement first?\"  The jury answered, \"Action Box.\"</span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span></span><span>Despite the jury's answers, the trial court entered JNOV in favor of Action\r\nBox.  Gaylord now argues that the trial court erred because there was some evidence\r\nsupporting the jury's finding that Action Box's failure to dismiss the Settlement\r\nAgreement was a material breach of the Settlement Agreement.  On appeal, the\r\nparties do not take issue with the phrasing of the jury question submitted, and Action\r\nBox does not argue that its failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit was not a breach of\r\nthe Settlement Agreement.  Instead, the parties dispute whether there was any\r\nevidence supporting the jury's verdict that the failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit\r\nwith prejudice was \"material.\"  Action Box's briefing essentially concedes it failed\r\nto comply with the Settlement Agreement, but it argues that the Agreement did not\r\nspecify a deadline by which it was to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit, Gaylord did not\r\nsuffer any damages, and its failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit therefore cannot, as\r\na matter of law, be a material breach excusing Gaylord's performance of the Discount\r\nProgram. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Settlement Agreement explicitly stated that its purpose was to allow\r\nGaylord and Action Box to \"avoid further time, expense and the uncertaint[ies]\r\ninvolved in the lawsuit[s].\"  The evidence at trial showed that Gaylord and Action\r\nBox had entered into the Settlement Agreement after a mediation involving a number\r\nof the people who actually testified at trial, and that both sides expected the\r\nSettlement Agreement to resolve the differences between them and allow them to\r\ncontinue to do business with each other.  There is no dispute that, after it received\r\nAction Box's payment under the Settlement Agreement, Gaylord dismissed the\r\nLouisiana Lawsuit.  The course of dealing between the parties quickly deteriorated\r\nafter that.  There was some evidence, based upon the timing of the events at issue,\r\nthat could have reasonably led the jury to infer that the soured relationship was due,\r\nin some part, to Action Box's failure to dismiss the still-pending Texas Lawsuit, thus\r\ndepriving Gaylord of the benefit it sought in the Settlement Agreement and\r\nsupporting a finding by the jury that Action Box's breach failed to \"comport[] with\r\nstandards of good faith and fair dealing.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, Gaylord's attorney testified that, as a result of Action Box's failure\r\nto dismiss the Texas Lawsuit as it had promised, he contacted Action Box's attorneys'\r\nto ask them to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit with prejudice and that he even reviewed\r\nand signed an agreed dismissal with prejudice that Action Box's attorneys prepared\r\nand circulated to Gaylord but that Action Box then failed to file with the trial court. \r\nOnce the litigation over the failed Settlement Agreement began in earnest, Gaylord's\r\nattorneys' took steps to clarify Action Box's pleadings as to whether Action Box was\r\nstill seeking damages for the claims it raised regarding the pitted cardboard, or\r\nwhether Action Box was now solely limiting itself to the allegation that Gaylord was\r\nobligated to sell single wall sheets to Action Box, and to peg its prices to a\r\ncompetitive price, conducted discovery on the issue, and filed a motion for summary\r\njudgment.  There was testimony that Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas\r\nLawsuit was a \"strategic\" decision Action Box made to ensure any further litigation\r\nwould be based in Texas rather than Louisiana, and that Gaylord's attorneys\r\nexpended time and effort to finally defeat any pending claims relating to the pitted\r\ncardboard, thus incurring damages in the form of attorney's fees for Gaylord. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe plain terms of the Settlement Agreement called for Action Box to dismiss\r\nthe pending Texas Lawsuit \"with prejudice,\" thus closing the chapter on the original\r\nGaylord-Action Box dispute regarding the pitted cardboard.  A dismissal with\r\nprejudice is the final resolution of a controversy, and the claims raised in the lawsuit\r\ncannot be re-litigated.  </span><span></span><span><em>See, e.g.</em>,<em> Mossler v. Shields</em></span><span></span><span>, 818 S.W.2d 752, 754 (Tex. 1991)\r\n(per curiam) (\"[I]t is well established that a dismissal with prejudice functions as a\r\nfinal determination on the merits.\"); </span><span></span><span><em>accord Ritchey v. Vasquez</em></span><span></span><span>, 986 S.W.2d 611, 612\r\n(Tex. 1999) (per curiam).  As Gaylord's attorneys testified, a dismissal with prejudice\r\nis distinct from an instance in which a party files a lawsuit and then decides to delay\r\nor avoid prosecution of that lawsuit without achieving a final resolution of the claims. \r\nHere, the jury heard evidence from Gaylord's attorneys that Gaylord expected Action\r\nBox to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit with prejudice after the Settlement Agreement was\r\nin effect, and it was their professional opinion that Gaylord was required to defend\r\nitself against any lingering claims Action Box may have been raising in the Texas\r\nLawsuit relating to the pitted fiber board, notwithstanding the fact that those claims\r\nhad been released in the Settlement Agreement.  Gaylord's attorney testified that, in\r\nhis opinion, it would have been \"malpractice\" for Gaylord's attorneys to fail to take\r\naction to finally defeat the claim filed against their client, and that Gaylord suffered\r\ndamages in the form of attorney's fees and costs as a result of having to finally defeat\r\nany claims relating to the pitted fiber board.  Action Box did not present any evidence\r\nto the contrary, but instead contended that its live pleadings, after September 2004,\r\ndid not relate to the pitted fiber board.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, there was more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the jury's\r\nfinding that Action Box materially breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to\r\ndismiss the Texas Lawsuit and requiring Gaylord to take action to finally resolve\r\nthese claims to achieve the benefit it sought in the Settlement Agreement.  We sustain\r\nthis part of Gaylord's first issue, and hold that the trial court erred when it entered\r\nJNOV in favor of Action Box and disregarded the jury's finding that Action Box was\r\nthe first to materially breach the Settlement Agreement. </span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span><strong>\t\tIII. </strong></span><span></span><span>\t</span><span></span><span><strong>Did Gaylord conclusively establish that it is entitled to $463,055.76 as\r\ndamages for Action Box's failure to dismiss the Settlement Agreement? </strong></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tAs noted above, the jury found that Gaylord was entitled to $5,070 in damages,\r\nincluding attorney's fees, as a result of Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas\r\nLawsuit.  Having found in favor of Gaylord on its breach of contract claim against\r\nAction Box for failure to dismiss the Settlement Agreement, we next turn to the issue\r\nof Gaylord's damages stemming from Action Box's failure to dismiss the Settlement\r\nAgreement.  In part of its first issue and in its second issue on appeal, Gaylord argues\r\nthat it should recover $463,055.76 as damages for Action Box's failure to dismiss the\r\nLawsuit because it contends that it conclusively established at trial, as a matter of law,\r\nthat it was entitled to such damages in the form of lost profits and attorney's fees.  We\r\ndisagree. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, the testimony on Gaylord's lost profits fell far short of \"conclusive.\" Don\r\nSparaco testified regarding Gaylord's general profit margin on the Bogalusa plant,\r\nand based upon that profit margin he conservatively estimated that the Bogalusa plant\r\nand the mill would have earned a combined profit of $398,440 if Action Box had\r\npurchased the full $1.4 million in products under the Discount Program.  Sparaco's\r\ntestimony was undermined, however, by his admission that he had not included a 2%\r\ndiscount for prompt payment as called for by the Settlement Agreement, and by his\r\nadmission that he did not know the underlying costs of production for the products\r\nlisted in the Settlement Agreement.  Further, his testimony as to the actual lost profits\r\nwas contradicted by his admission that the Bogalusa plant had been able to use the\r\nraw materials and processing effort that it would have directed to filling Action Box's\r\norders under the Discount Program to filling orders for other customers at full\r\nprice--thus presumably making rather than losing money for the Bogalusa facility. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, the jury heard a great deal of testimony regarding the nature of the\r\ndispute between the two parties, and was the ultimate decision maker as to the\r\nreasonableness and necessity of the attorney's fees incurred by Gaylord. Gaylord asks\r\nus to award the full amount of attorney's fees it claims it incurred as a result of Action\r\nBox's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit with prejudice.  Gaylord points to\r\ntestimony from its attorneys at trial and argues that the evidence conclusively\r\nestablished that it incurred $65,667.76 in attorney's fees and expenses as a result of\r\nAction Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit, and complains that the jury\r\nessentially awarded it nothing on attorney's fees.  We note, however, that the jury's\r\naward of $5,070 in response to Question 14 specifically included \"[t]he cost in\r\ndefending this lawsuit after Action Box failed to dismiss it, including but not limited\r\nto, attorney's fees and expenses associated with defending this suit.\"  Gaylord does\r\nnot complain on appeal that the question was improper.  Thus, under the plain\r\nlanguage of the question submitted, Gaylord did recover some of its attorney's fees\r\nrelated to Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurther, Gaylord's attorneys were subject to cross-examination on the amount\r\nof time they spent on the matters to which they testified, and the jury could have\r\nlegitimately found that the attorney's fees in excess of $5,070 were not reasonable in\r\nlight of the circumstances of this case, which included breaches of the Settlement\r\nAgreement by both parties and an admittedly long history of contention between\r\nGaylord and Action Box.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"The reasonableness of attorney's fees is ordinarily left to the factfinder, and\r\na reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for the jury's.\"</span><span></span><span><em>  Smith v.

Each side extensively cross-examined the other about which claims were recoverable and whether the attorneys\r\nhad properly segregated their time on the recoverable and non-recoverable claims. \r\nFurther, the attendant circumstances of this case--including but not limited to the\r\nnumber of lawyers for each side, especially Gaylord, who had three experts on\r\nattorney's fees alone; the protracted history of litigation between the parties; the\r\nquestionable conduct of each side in relation to the Settlement Agreement; and the\r\noverall harm, other than attorney's fees, that Gaylord suffered as a result of Action\r\nBox's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit--could have reasonably supported the\r\njury's decision to award Gaylord less than the full amount of attorney's fees that it\r\nrequested.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Gaylord did not \"conclusively establish\" that it was entitled to\r\n$463,055.76 in damages, and because Question 14 included an award of attorney's\r\nfees to Gaylord, we find that the evidence supports the jury's award of $5,070 in\r\nGaylord's favor.

We construe\r\nthis as an attack on the jury's answer to Question 9.  Question 9 asked whether Action\r\nBox had breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to make a good faith effort to\r\ncomplete the Discount Program by November 30, 2004, or a reasonable time\r\nthereafter.  The jury answered, \"No.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile Gaylord argued otherwise during trial, Action Box's employees\r\nrepeatedly testified that they desired to have orders filled by the Bogalusa plant in an\r\neffort to fulfill the Discount Program and thus recoup some of the $70,000 in\r\ndiscounts to which Action Box was entitled under the Settlement Agreement. \r\nAlthough those orders did not always conform to the specifics of the products offered\r\nby the Bogalusa plant, the jury heard testimony and saw evidence that Action Box\r\nsubmitted orders to Bogalusa and to other competitors and that it fully intended to\r\ncomplete the Discount Program within the required time frame.  Gaylord failed to\r\nconclusively establish that Action Box breached the Settlement Agreement by failing\r\nto make a good faith effort to complete the Discount Program by November 30, 2004,\r\nor a reasonable time thereafter, and there is sufficient evidence to support the jury's\r\nverdict.

Gaylord is a supplier\r\nof raw material from which such boxes are made.  Gaylord's Bogalusa, Louisiana\r\nplant (\"Bogalusa\") produces bulk boxes as well as other cardboard-related materials. \r\nThe plant's primary product is laminated cardboard boxes, a specialty product\r\nmanufactured by only a few other competitors.  The cardboard products produced by\r\nBogalusa vary according to their composition, weight and strength, and are made of\r\nvarious combinations of cardboard components (</span><span><em></em></span><span>i.e</span><span></span><span>., walls, sheets, fluting).  Bogalusa\r\nbases its pricing upon the cost of goods sold as well as upon the distance to the\r\ncustomer, and the market to which it sells varies according to the product produced.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAction Box was a customer of Bogalusa, primarily purchasing solid fiber\r\nmaterial to manufacture boxes.  </span><span></span><span>Eighty percent of the cardboard materials Action Box\r\nuses are single-walled sheets of cardboard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span><strong><em><span>The Parties' Initial Dispute Leads to a Settlement Agreement</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t In 2003, Gaylord filed a lawsuit against Action Box in Louisiana (the\r\n\"Louisiana Lawsuit\"), in which Gaylord alleged that Action Box owed it $54,533.24\r\nfor four orders of solid fiber cardboard in January and March 2003.  Shortly\r\nthereafter, Action Box filed a reciprocal lawsuit suit against Gaylord in Harris\r\nCounty, Texas (the \"Texas Lawsuit\"), alleging that the cardboard it purchased in\r\nJanuary and March 2003 from Gaylord was pitted and thus defective, causing Action\r\nBox to incur significant damages.  Action Box alleged violations of the Texas\r\nDeceptive Trade Practices Act and that Gaylord negligently represented the quality\r\nof its products.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn May 2004, the parties mediated their dispute regarding the pitted cardboard\r\nand reached an agreement by which Action Box would pay Gaylord $54,533.24 by\r\nJune 15, 2004, and Gaylord, upon receiving such payment, would grant Action Box\r\na 5% discount on certain of its products, up to a total discount of $70,000 (the\r\n\"Discount Program\").  Jim McIntyre, Gaylord's sales manager at the time, testified\r\nthat this was the first such Discount Program Gaylord had ever entered into.  On June\r\n1, 2004, Action Box attempted to place its first order taking advantage of the\r\nDiscount Program.  The order was for a large quantity of single wall sheets--a\r\nproduct that the Gaylord Bogalusa plant did not generally sell and that it had not\r\npreviously sold to Action Box.  The order was rejected by Gaylord.  McIntyre stated\r\nthat the order was rejected because the Gaylord Bogalusa facility, \"as a general rule,\"\r\ndid not produce single wall sheets in the quantity ordered by Action Box because the\r\nplant was \"not equipped to handle\" the order.  McIntyre testified that Action Box was\r\nverbally informed that Gaylord would not fill the order for single wall sheets on the\r\ngrounds that single wall sheets were not usually produced by the Bogalusa plant.  At\r\ntrial, McIntyre testified that, due to the process of manufacturing and the size of the\r\nmachines at issue, only 1/100th of the Bogalusa plant's output was single wall sheets. \r\nMcIntyre testified that the small quantities of single wall sheet that were produced\r\nwent to four customers, and that most of it was sent to local customers.  McIntyre\r\nexplained that these sales were \"special deals\" to accommodate these customers and\r\nthat Gaylord sold only a small quantity of single wall board to each of these\r\ncustomers.  McIntyre further testified that much of the single wall material sold was\r\ntaken out of overrun from other products.  Rick Bailey, a salesman for Gaylord, also\r\ntestified that it was \"very difficult\" to handle sales of single wall sheets and that it\r\nwas not the normal course of Gaylord's business to do so.  Bailey also testified that\r\nBogalusa did not sell single wall sheets in the quantities ordered by Action Box.  At\r\ntrial, purchase orders and testimony showed that Bogalusa sold single wall sheets to\r\nother companies during 2004, but that these sales were in smaller quantities than the\r\norders placed by Action Box.  McIntyre testified that, if Action Box had ordered a\r\nquantity of single wall sheets that he could fill from his overrun supplies, then he\r\nwould have filled the order.  McIntyre also described that, in the Bogalusa\r\nmanufacturing process, the plant's ability to produce a particular product at a\r\nparticular price depended upon the dimensions of the sheets ordered as well as the\r\ntotal square footage of the order.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, Gaylord faxed the June 1, 2006 order back to Action Box with\r\nthe following notation: \"Please process through Texas Sheets. Orders not to be\r\nprocessed through Bogalusa Plant until paid in full by the proposed due date of June\r\n15, 2004.\"  Texas Sheets is a San Antonio facility owned by Gaylord's parent\r\ncompany, Temple-Inland.  Texas Sheets is a \"sheet plant\" and one of its products is\r\nsingle wall sheets, although not the specialty heavy weight single wall sheets that the\r\nBogalusa plant can produce.  The fax did not inform Action Box that Bogalusa did\r\nnot manufacture single wall sheets in the quantity Action Box sought.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn mid-June 2004, Action Box and Gaylord formalized their settlement by\r\nexecuting the Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (\"Settlement Agreement\").\r\nThe Settlement Agreement stated its purpose was to settle the Texas and the\r\nLouisiana Lawsuits because both parties wished to \"avoid further time, expense and\r\nthe uncertaint[ies] involved in the lawsuit[s].\"  Action Box agreed to pay Gaylord\r\n$54,533.24 to settle the Louisiana Lawsuit in exchange for Gaylord's agreement that\r\nit would \"release and forever discharge Action Box from any claim asserted or which\r\ncould have been asserted in the Louisiana Action\" and an agreement that Gaylord\r\nwould \"dismiss, with prejudice, the Louisiana Action.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs to the Texas Lawsuit, the parties formalized the agreed-upon \"Discount\r\nProgram\" under which Action Box would receive a 5% discount on all of its\r\npurchases of solid fiber, solid fiber boxes, triple wall, double wall and single wall\r\nproducts from the Inland Gaylord-Bogalusa Plant, up to a total discount of $70,000. \r\nThe parties agreed that they would \"in good faith . . . attempt to complete\" the full\r\nDiscount Program by November 30, 2004, but they also agreed that the Discount\r\nProgram would last until the full benefits had been received by Action Box.  The\r\nSettlement Agreement stated</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>The prices for the goods (prior to the discount) being sold by Gaylord\r\nto Action Box pursuant to this settlement shall be competitive and\r\npegged to the current prices being paid by Action Box for the same\r\ngoods which Action Box purchases from competitors of Gaylord.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>Action Box also agreed that it would \"release and forever discharge Gaylord from any\r\nclaims asserted or which could have been asserted in the Texas Action\" and that it\r\nwould \"dismiss, with prejudice, the Texas Action.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAction Box paid Gaylord $54,533.24 in mid-June 2004, as it had promised in\r\nthe Settlement Agreement.  Action Box did not, however, file a non-suit or notice of\r\ndismissal of the Texas Lawsuit. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn late June and early July 2004, Action Box placed more orders with Gaylord,\r\nagain ordering a large quantity of single wall sheets.  Gaylord refused to fill these\r\norders, this time returning the orders via fax with the following notes: \"Send to Texas\r\nSheets.  Not run in Bogalusa\" and \"Not for Bogalusa-We don't run for you. Send to\r\nTexas Sheets.\"  McIntyre testified that Action Box appeared to be ordering \"multiple\r\ntruckloads\" of single-walled sheets, and that he had informed Action Box that the\r\nsingle wall product it was ordering was something that the Bogalusa plant did not\r\nnormally produce.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring the summer, Action Box also ordered a quantity of double-walled and\r\ntriple-walled sheets, but paid less than the quoted price for the double-walled sheets. \r\nMcIntyre testified that he had charged Action Box a previously quoted price and that\r\nhe had not \"pegged\" the price to the current prices Action Box may have been paying\r\nother suppliers because Action Box did not provide verification of those prices. \r\nMcIntyre also admitted that he was not aware of the particulars of the Discount\r\nProgram at the time, but he testified that if Action Box had provided him with\r\ndocumentation of competitor's prices and informed him of the Discount Program\r\nparticulars, he would have lowered the quoted prices accordingly.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDespite these ongoing disputes, Action Box continued to place orders for\r\nvarious products, including double wall and triple wall cardboard.  Action Box placed\r\norders for products on October 12, 2004, and another on January 14, 2005.  On\r\nJanuary 21, 2005, Don Sparaco, the plant manager for the Bogalusa plant, wrote a\r\nletter to Action Box informing it that Bogalusa could not produce the requested sizes\r\nof double wall sheets at the price Action Box specified:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>We received a fax order from your company for various size double wall\r\nsheets and relayed that we would be happy to process this order through\r\nour Texas Sheets operation. Unfortunately, unless we had overruns\r\navailable from orders for converted boxes, Bogalusa could not sell the\r\nordered products at the prices indicated on your order form. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span>\t. . . .  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span>We are willing to produce the products you ordered, but at higher prices\r\nthan indicated on your order form.  Of course, you would receive the 5%\r\ndiscount off of our prices, per our Settlement Agreement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>Action Box continued to send orders for products and quantities that Bogalusa did not\r\nnormally produce.  Sparaco sent another letter to Action Box on March 28, 2005,\r\nstating:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>As a member of the solid fiber/corrugated paper industry, you know that\r\nthe Bogalusa plant['s] manufacturing and packaging capabilities are\r\nincompatible with your order. . . . Additionally, you are submitting blind\r\norders for products, with prices already specified.  You know . . . this is\r\nnot the way we operate.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>This lawsuit has created a strange situation.  Action Box is now ordering\r\nproducts under the settlement agreement that you never ordered from\r\nthis facility before and which you know the facility cannot fulfill.  You\r\nare also submitting orders differently than before.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>We are ready to sell to Action Box products sold from this facility in the\r\nordinary course of business, at a competitive price discounted by the\r\nagreed upon five percent.  However, we cannot sell Action Box products\r\nwe do not ourselves sell in the ordinary course of our business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span><strong>Additional Litigation Arises out of the Settlement Agreement</strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn late summer and fall of 2004, while Gaylord and Action Box were\r\nexchanging correspondence regarding the above orders, they were also filing new\r\nclaims and suits against each other.  On August 6, 2004, Gaylord filed a new lawsuit\r\nin Louisiana, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Settlement Agreement did not\r\nrequire it to sell Action Box single wall sheets.  On September 9, 2004, Action Box\r\nfiled its \"First Amended Original Petition\" in the Texas Lawsuit, which it had never\r\ndismissed despite its agreement to do so--with prejudice--in the Settlement\r\nAgreement.  Action Box later added claims for breach of contract, alleging that the\r\nagreement reached between the parties at mediation and the Settlement Agreement\r\nconstituted one, single agreement, and that Gaylord had failed to comply with the\r\nterms of that agreement by failing to fill Action Box's June 1, 2004 order for single\r\nwall sheets and that Gaylord \"further indicated it would never sell single wall sheets\r\nto Action Box.\"  In addition, Action Box alleged that Gaylord had breached its\r\nagreement to sell products to Action Box at prices that were \"pegged to the current\r\nprices being paid by Action Box for the same goods which Action Box purchase[d]\r\nfrom competitors of Gaylord,\" and that Gaylord \"failed to act in good faith to\r\ncomplete sales contemplated by the agreement.\"  Action Box sought to recover\r\ndamages and attorney's fees based upon Gaylord's alleged breaches.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGaylord counterclaimed, alleging that Action Box had failed to act in \"good\r\nfaith\" to place enough orders to complete the Discount Program.  Gaylord alleged that\r\nAction Box had breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to dismiss the Texas\r\nLawsuit, by opposing abatement of the Texas Lawsuit, and by continuing to prosecute\r\nthe Texas Lawsuit.  Gaylord also alleged that Action Box's failure to place enough\r\norders to complete the Discount Program violated the Settlement Agreement. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAction Box raised the affirmative defenses of anticipatory repudiation, prior\r\nmaterial breach, and failure of consideration. Action Box also alleged that Gaylord\r\nhad failed to mitigate its own damages.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGaylord pled the affirmative defenses of estoppel and failure of consideration. \r\nIn addition, Gaylord asserted that Chapter 154 of the Texas Civil Practice and\r\nRemedies Code barred any recovery by Action Box and that Action Box had\r\njudicially admitted that it could have fulfilled its obligations under the Discount\r\nProgram within one year of the Settlement Agreement.  Gaylord also argued that\r\nAction Box was not entitled to its attorney's fees because it had not complied with\r\nthe requirements of Section 38.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBefore the case went to trial, Gaylord obtained a ruling from the trial court\r\nconstruing the Settlement Agreement to mean that Gaylord's obligation to sell\r\nproducts to Action Box was limited to those products and quantities that the Gaylord-Bogalusa facility actually offered, produced, and otherwise sold to the market in\r\ngeneral.  That order is not part of the clerk's record in this appeal.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span><strong><em><span>The Evidence at Trial</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring trial, Action Box presented evidence that, over the course of 2004,\r\nBogalusa quoted and sold a large quantity of single wall and double wall sheets to\r\nother companies, but that Gaylord refused to fill Action Box's June and July orders\r\nfor what Action Box claimed was a similar product.  McIntyre testified that the\r\nproducts sold to these customers and the products requested by Action Box were\r\nsubstantially different, and that Bogalusa did not generally offer the single wall\r\nproducts ordered by Action Box in 2004.  Further, both Bailey and McIntyre testified\r\nthat Action Box requested a much larger quantity of product than the other customers. \r\nBrett Camp, purchasing manager for Action Box, testified that Gaylord had never told\r\nAction Box it had a minimum or maximum order for any of its products.  Further,\r\nCamp testified that he had never been told, prior to the rejection of the June 1, 2004\r\norder, that Bogalusa did not manufacture and sell single wall sheets to the general\r\nmarket.  Instead, Camp testified that he placed the single wall order with Bogalusa\r\njust as he would have with Action Box's other suppliers, and that he continued to\r\nplace the order despite Gaylord's refusal to fill it.  Camp testified that he placed an\r\norder for double wall sheets at a price he confirmed with McIntyre, contradicting\r\nMcIntyre's testimony that the order was not paid in full.  Camp stated that Action Box\r\ncontinued to place orders, in good faith, with Gaylord to fulfill the Discount Program\r\nbut that the companies continued to disagree about the prices to be paid for double\r\nwall sheets and whether Bogalusa was obligated to fill Action Box's orders for single\r\nwall sheets.  Camp also testified that Action Box's quick turnaround time on orders\r\nmeant that he did not have time to negotiate with a supplier on an unfavorable price,\r\nbut that he instead would then take the order to another supplier for a better price. \r\nCamp confirmed that, over 11 and a half months, Action Box ordered a sufficient\r\nquantity of materials from other suppliers to fulfill its obligations under the Discount\r\nProgram and that, had Bogalusa sold it single wall products, Action Box would have\r\nplaced these orders through Bogalusa.  According to Camp, Gaylord never informed\r\nAction Box that it could only fill orders of single wall products in the amounts it\r\ngenerally made available to other customers, nor did Action Box know the amount\r\nof single wall sheet Gaylord generally made available to other customers.  Camp\r\nstated that he would have accepted an offer from Bogalusa to partially fill the orders\r\nAction Box placed, and he still intended, as late as February 2005, to place orders\r\nunder the Discount Program.  Other Action Box representatives confirmed Action\r\nBox's intention to continue to place orders under the Discount Program, regardless\r\nof the ongoing disputes with Gaylord.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDon Sparaco testified on behalf of Gaylord, estimating that Gaylord had\r\nsuffered $398,400 in lost profits as a result of Action Box's failure to complete the\r\nDiscount Program by purchasing the required amount of $1,400,000 in products from\r\nthe Bogalusa facility.  Sparaco's estimate was based upon a general 8.46% profit\r\nmargin for the facility, which would have amounted to $48,440 in profits upon\r\n$1,400,000 in sales, less the $70,000 in discounts promised to Action Box.  Sparaco\r\ntestified that the profit margin depended upon the product ordered, and that 8.46%\r\nwas a conservative estimate of the profit Gaylord could have expected.  In addition,\r\nSparaco asserted that Gaylord's mill, which supplied Bogalusa with its raw materials,\r\nalso suffered damages of $350,000 in profits lost from sales to the Bogalusa facility\r\ndue to Action Box's failure to complete the Discount Program.  In total, Sparaco\r\ntestified that Gaylord suffered $397,388 in lost profits. Sparaco was cross-examined\r\non his damages model, and admitted that he had not included a possible 2% discount\r\nfor payments within 20 days.  Sparaco also admitted that, even if Action Box had not\r\nplaced orders for particular products, Gaylord could have used the raw materials and\r\nresources at issue to fulfill other customers' orders at full price, thus reducing its\r\ndamages.  Finally, Sparaco stated that he did not know the profit margin on single\r\nwall sheets.  None of the testifying Gaylord employees stated that they ever informed\r\nAction Box that Bogalusa could supply it with smaller quantities of single wall\r\nproduct from its overrun supplies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBoth sides offered the testimony of their trial attorneys regarding the fees their\r\nclients accrued in prosecution and defense of the lawsuit.  Martin Shellist, Action\r\nBox's trial counsel, testified at length regarding the fees incurred by his client. \r\nShellist testified that the case, pending since 2004, was a complex commercial case\r\ninvolving legal issues that required the trial court's intervention.  Shellist briefly\r\ndescribed his involvement in the mediation and ensuing revival of litigation between\r\nAction Box and Gaylord, describing it as a \"shame; a crying shame.\"  Shellist\r\ntestified that, in his opinion, the fees Action Box incurred were reasonable and\r\nnecessary, and that the fees through trial were estimated to be over $290,000.  Shellist\r\nalso testified that he believed appellate fees would total over $135,000.  Shellist was\r\ncross-examined by Gaylord's attorneys about the segregation of his firm's work on\r\nvarious causes of action and defenses raised by Action Box during the lawsuit.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGaylord's trial counsel, John Newton, III, also testified about the fees his client\r\nincurred.  Newton testified about fees and costs Gaylord incurred to (1) defeat Action\r\nBox's claim for the defective materials it ordered in 2003; (2) prosecute its\r\ncounterclaim against Action Box for failing to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit as it had\r\npromised in the Settlement Agreement; and (3) prosecute its second counterclaim\r\nagainst Action Box for failing to complete the Discount Program in good faith.  The\r\ntotal amount, including estimated trial time, was $373,701.40.  Newton testified that\r\nGaylord was not seeking to recover the fees it incurred in defending itself against\r\nAction Box's breach of contract claim.  Like Shellist, Newton also testified that the\r\ncase was complicated and time-intensive.  Newton also testified that he believed\r\nattorney's fees could reasonably exceed the amount of damages in controversy\r\nbecause \"[Y]ou can't stop working.  You have to do the work.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNewton also stated that the fees incurred to defeat Action Box's claim for\r\ndefective solid fiber board were incurred because Action Box failed to honor its\r\ncommitment to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit with prejudice.  According to Newton,\r\nAction Box's attorneys drafted a proposed dismissal with prejudice of the Texas\r\nLawsuit, circulated it to Gaylord, but never filed it.  Newton testified that Action Box\r\ninstead continued to seek damages relating to the solid fiber board dispute into the\r\nfall of 2004, and that it was his professional opinion that it was necessary for Gaylord\r\nto actively seek the Court's intervention and have that claim dismissed from the\r\nlitigation.  Newton testified that he filed special exceptions and sent discovery\r\nrequests to determine whether Action Box was indeed continuing to seek damages\r\nrelated to the pitted fiber board, and that he filed a motion for summary judgment on\r\nGaylord's behalf to finally resolve the issue.  According to Newton, all of these\r\nactions caused Gaylord to incur attorney's fees and costs.  On cross-examination,\r\nNewton agreed that, even though Gaylord had expended a sum of money in seeing\r\nthat Action Box's claims regarding the defective fiber board were finally dismissed,\r\nand it was his opinion that these actions were necessary to protect Gaylord's interests,\r\nthe jury was the ultimate decision maker as to whether those fees were reasonably\r\nnecessary.  Newton was cross-examined regarding his segregation of fees and his\r\ncontention that some categories of both Action Box's and Gaylord's attorneys' fees\r\nwere not recoverable as a matter of law in the case.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRobert M. Roach, Jr., another of Gaylord's attorneys, also testified regarding\r\nGaylord's attorney's fees.  Roach specifically stated that all of the attorney's fees\r\nGaylord incurred in order to get summary judgment were a direct result of Action\r\nBox's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit.  Roach also testified that a distinction\r\nexisted between Action Box's decision not to prosecute its defective product claims\r\nin the Texas Lawsuit further and a dismissal of those claims and suit with prejudice.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>[Counsel for Action Box:] Just having a case on file somewhere, does\r\nnot necessarily cause a party to have any damages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\t[Roach:] I disagree with that completely.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span>[Counsel for Action Box:] Okay.  A party only has damages if they - if\r\nanother party actually pursues the case against them and gets a\r\njudgment, isn't that right, sir?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\t[Roach:] No, sir, that's silly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t[Counsel for Action Box:] How am I wrong about that, sir?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>[Roach:] Well, I teach my students and associates if a lawsuit is pending\r\nagainst you, you cannot sit on your hands and do nothing.  You have\r\nbeen sued.  And you have got to affirmatively protect your client as long\r\nas that lawsuit is on - is on file.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>So it would be, in my opinion, silly and malpractice to treat this as - as\r\nnot being there and something you could ignore.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>[Counsel for Action Box:] Yes, sir.  What about a lawsuit that has been\r\nreleased?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>[Roach:] If it has not been dismissed with prejudice when it is supposed\r\nto be dismissed with prejudice, you have a problem that you have to take\r\nvery seriously.  And this lawsuit, and that fact that we are here today, is\r\nevidence that if you don't take it seriously you are making a big mistake.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tA third expert witness, John Spalding, also testified on Gaylord's behalf\r\nregarding attorney's fees.  Spalding testified that he believed Action Box had made\r\na strategic decision not to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit, even though it had agreed to do\r\nso in the Settlement Agreement, so that the Texas Lawsuit would remain in force in\r\ncase Gaylord sought to file a Louisiana Lawsuit over any disputes that might arise\r\nunder the Discount Program.  Spalding based this opinion on statements made in\r\nAction Box's bills for its attorneys' time, which revealed that Action Box's attorneys\r\nconducted research on the \"first filed rule\"--a rule courts generally follow when two\r\nlawsuits are filed in different forums, requiring the latter-filed suit to stop and wait\r\nfor the resolution of the earlier suit.</span><span></span><span><sup> (1)</sup></span><span></span><span></span><span>  Spalding also generally opined as to the\r\nnecessity and reasonableness of the fees in the case, stating that Action Box's fees\r\nappeared to be too high and include mistaken entries and some double-invoicing and\r\nthat Gaylord's fees appeared to be generally reasonable, with the exception of some\r\nmistaken entries. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span>The Jury's Verdict</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, the jury found that both Gaylord and Action Box had breached the\r\nSettlement Agreement. The jury found that Gaylord breached the Settlement\r\nAgreement by, on October 14, 2004 and January 14, 2005, failing to peg its prices to\r\nthe then-current prices being paid by Action Box for the same goods that Action Box\r\npurchased from competitors.  The jury found that Gaylord's breach of the Settlement\r\nAgreement was material, and assessed benefit of the bargain damages for Action Box\r\nof $13,378.27.  The jury awarded Action Box $158,696.97 in attorney's fees for\r\npreparation and trial, but did not award any attorney's fees for appeal.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury also found that Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit was\r\na material breach of the Settlement Agreement, and awarded Gaylord $5,070 as\r\ndamages for the cost of defending the lawsuit after Action Box failed to dismiss it. \r\nThe jury did not award Gaylord any additional attorney's fees.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury was specifically asked which party failed to comply with the\r\nSettlement Agreement first.  The jury found that Action Box had been the first to fail\r\nto comply with the Settlement Agreement.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em><span></span></em></strong></span><span><strong><em><span>The Trial Court Enters JNOV</span></em></strong></span><span><em><span></span></em></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em>Gaylord's Motion for JNOV</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the jury's verdict, Gaylord moved for entry of judgment based on the\r\njury's verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  Gaylord asked the court\r\nto enter judgment in accordance with the jury's answers to Questions 13 and 16--\r\nthat Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit was a material breach of the\r\nSettlement Agreement, and that Action Box was the party that first breached the\r\nSettlement Agreement.  Further, Gaylord argued that the jury's answers to Questions\r\n2 and 3--that Gaylord had failed to comply with the Settlement Agreement by\r\nrefusing to peg its prices in accordance with the Agreement--should be disregarded\r\nin light of the jury's findings that Action Box committed the first material breach of\r\nthe Settlement Agreement.  Alternatively, Gaylord argued that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to support the jury's answer to Questions 2 and 3.  Based upon its\r\narguments that the jury's answers to Questions 2 and 3 should be disregarded,\r\nGaylord also argued that Action Box was not entitled to recover its attorney's fees. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGaylord also asked the trial court to enter judgment in accordance with the\r\njury's answers to Questions 1, 4, and 5--that Gaylord had not breached the\r\nSettlement Agreement by not filling orders Action Box placed on July 6, 2004; March\r\n22, 2005; October 12, 2005.</span><span></span><span><sup> (2)</sup></span><span></span><span></span><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to seeking judgment based upon the jury's answers that Action Box\r\nhad been the first to breach the Settlement Agreement, and that Action Box had\r\nmaterially breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to dismiss the Texas\r\nLawsuit, Gaylord asked the trial court to award it more damages than the jury had\r\nawarded as damages for Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit.  Instead\r\nof the $5,070 awarded by the jury for Action Box's failure to dismiss the lawsuit,\r\nGaylord argued that the evidence conclusively established it suffered damages in the\r\namount of $463,055.76--$65,667.76 in fees and costs related to the lawsuit and\r\n$397,388 in benefit of the bargain damages lost as a result of Action Box's failure to\r\nfulfill its purchasing obligations under the Settlement Agreement.  Similarly, Gaylord\r\nasked the court to enter judgment notwithstanding the jury's answer to Question\r\n15--that, despite Action Box's material breach and Gaylord's damages, Gaylord was\r\nnot entitled to any attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, Gaylord asked the trial court to disregard the jury's answer to Question\r\n19--that Action Box had not failed to comply with its obligation under the Settlement\r\nAgreement to make a good faith effort to complete the Discount Program by\r\nNovember 30, 2004 or a reasonable date thereafter.  Instead, Gaylord argued that it\r\nwas entitled to judgment that Action Box had not acted in good faith under the\r\nSettlement Agreement and that it was also entitled to receive its benefit of the bargain\r\ndamages and attorney's fees.\t\t</span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><strong><em>Action Box's Motion for JNOV</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAction Box also moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  Action Box\r\nargued that, while the jury found that Action Box was the first to breach the\r\nSettlement Agreement, that the breach was not material and therefore did not excuse\r\nGaylord's performance under the Discount Program.

In Question 16, the jury was asked, \"Who failed to comply with the\r\nSettlement Agreement first?\"  The jury answered, \"Action Box.\"</span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span></span><span>Despite the jury's answers, the trial court entered JNOV in favor of Action\r\nBox.  Gaylord now argues that the trial court erred because there was some evidence\r\nsupporting the jury's finding that Action Box's failure to dismiss the Settlement\r\nAgreement was a material breach of the Settlement Agreement.  On appeal, the\r\nparties do not take issue with the phrasing of the jury question submitted, and Action\r\nBox does not argue that its failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit was not a breach of\r\nthe Settlement Agreement.  Instead, the parties dispute whether there was any\r\nevidence supporting the jury's verdict that the failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit\r\nwith prejudice was \"material.\"  Action Box's briefing essentially concedes it failed\r\nto comply with the Settlement Agreement, but it argues that the Agreement did not\r\nspecify a deadline by which it was to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit, Gaylord did not\r\nsuffer any damages, and its failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit therefore cannot, as\r\na matter of law, be a material breach excusing Gaylord's performance of the Discount\r\nProgram. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Settlement Agreement explicitly stated that its purpose was to allow\r\nGaylord and Action Box to \"avoid further time, expense and the uncertaint[ies]\r\ninvolved in the lawsuit[s].\"  The evidence at trial showed that Gaylord and Action\r\nBox had entered into the Settlement Agreement after a mediation involving a number\r\nof the people who actually testified at trial, and that both sides expected the\r\nSettlement Agreement to resolve the differences between them and allow them to\r\ncontinue to do business with each other.  There is no dispute that, after it received\r\nAction Box's payment under the Settlement Agreement, Gaylord dismissed the\r\nLouisiana Lawsuit.  The course of dealing between the parties quickly deteriorated\r\nafter that.  There was some evidence, based upon the timing of the events at issue,\r\nthat could have reasonably led the jury to infer that the soured relationship was due,\r\nin some part, to Action Box's failure to dismiss the still-pending Texas Lawsuit, thus\r\ndepriving Gaylord of the benefit it sought in the Settlement Agreement and\r\nsupporting a finding by the jury that Action Box's breach failed to \"comport[] with\r\nstandards of good faith and fair dealing.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition, Gaylord's attorney testified that, as a result of Action Box's failure\r\nto dismiss the Texas Lawsuit as it had promised, he contacted Action Box's attorneys'\r\nto ask them to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit with prejudice and that he even reviewed\r\nand signed an agreed dismissal with prejudice that Action Box's attorneys prepared\r\nand circulated to Gaylord but that Action Box then failed to file with the trial court. \r\nOnce the litigation over the failed Settlement Agreement began in earnest, Gaylord's\r\nattorneys' took steps to clarify Action Box's pleadings as to whether Action Box was\r\nstill seeking damages for the claims it raised regarding the pitted cardboard, or\r\nwhether Action Box was now solely limiting itself to the allegation that Gaylord was\r\nobligated to sell single wall sheets to Action Box, and to peg its prices to a\r\ncompetitive price, conducted discovery on the issue, and filed a motion for summary\r\njudgment.  There was testimony that Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas\r\nLawsuit was a \"strategic\" decision Action Box made to ensure any further litigation\r\nwould be based in Texas rather than Louisiana, and that Gaylord's attorneys\r\nexpended time and effort to finally defeat any pending claims relating to the pitted\r\ncardboard, thus incurring damages in the form of attorney's fees for Gaylord. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe plain terms of the Settlement Agreement called for Action Box to dismiss\r\nthe pending Texas Lawsuit \"with prejudice,\" thus closing the chapter on the original\r\nGaylord-Action Box dispute regarding the pitted cardboard.  A dismissal with\r\nprejudice is the final resolution of a controversy, and the claims raised in the lawsuit\r\ncannot be re-litigated.  </span><span></span><span><em>See, e.g.</em>,<em> Mossler v.

As Gaylord's attorneys testified, a dismissal with prejudice\r\nis distinct from an instance in which a party files a lawsuit and then decides to delay\r\nor avoid prosecution of that lawsuit without achieving a final resolution of the claims. \r\nHere, the jury heard evidence from Gaylord's attorneys that Gaylord expected Action\r\nBox to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit with prejudice after the Settlement Agreement was\r\nin effect, and it was their professional opinion that Gaylord was required to defend\r\nitself against any lingering claims Action Box may have been raising in the Texas\r\nLawsuit relating to the pitted fiber board, notwithstanding the fact that those claims\r\nhad been released in the Settlement Agreement.  Gaylord's attorney testified that, in\r\nhis opinion, it would have been \"malpractice\" for Gaylord's attorneys to fail to take\r\naction to finally defeat the claim filed against their client, and that Gaylord suffered\r\ndamages in the form of attorney's fees and costs as a result of having to finally defeat\r\nany claims relating to the pitted fiber board.  Action Box did not present any evidence\r\nto the contrary, but instead contended that its live pleadings, after September 2004,\r\ndid not relate to the pitted fiber board.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, there was more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the jury's\r\nfinding that Action Box materially breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to\r\ndismiss the Texas Lawsuit and requiring Gaylord to take action to finally resolve\r\nthese claims to achieve the benefit it sought in the Settlement Agreement.  We sustain\r\nthis part of Gaylord's first issue, and hold that the trial court erred when it entered\r\nJNOV in favor of Action Box and disregarded the jury's finding that Action Box was\r\nthe first to materially breach the Settlement Agreement. </span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span><strong>\t\tIII. </strong></span><span></span><span>\t</span><span></span><span><strong>Did Gaylord conclusively establish that it is entitled to $463,055.76 as\r\ndamages for Action Box's failure to dismiss the Settlement Agreement? </strong></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tAs noted above, the jury found that Gaylord was entitled to $5,070 in damages,\r\nincluding attorney's fees, as a result of Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas\r\nLawsuit.  Having found in favor of Gaylord on its breach of contract claim against\r\nAction Box for failure to dismiss the Settlement Agreement, we next turn to the issue\r\nof Gaylord's damages stemming from Action Box's failure to dismiss the Settlement\r\nAgreement.  In part of its first issue and in its second issue on appeal, Gaylord argues\r\nthat it should recover $463,055.76 as damages for Action Box's failure to dismiss the\r\nLawsuit because it contends that it conclusively established at trial, as a matter of law,\r\nthat it was entitled to such damages in the form of lost profits and attorney's fees.  We\r\ndisagree. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, the testimony on Gaylord's lost profits fell far short of \"conclusive.\" Don\r\nSparaco testified regarding Gaylord's general profit margin on the Bogalusa plant,\r\nand based upon that profit margin he conservatively estimated that the Bogalusa plant\r\nand the mill would have earned a combined profit of $398,440 if Action Box had\r\npurchased the full $1.4 million in products under the Discount Program.  Sparaco's\r\ntestimony was undermined, however, by his admission that he had not included a 2%\r\ndiscount for prompt payment as called for by the Settlement Agreement, and by his\r\nadmission that he did not know the underlying costs of production for the products\r\nlisted in the Settlement Agreement.  Further, his testimony as to the actual lost profits\r\nwas contradicted by his admission that the Bogalusa plant had been able to use the\r\nraw materials and processing effort that it would have directed to filling Action Box's\r\norders under the Discount Program to filling orders for other customers at full\r\nprice--thus presumably making rather than losing money for the Bogalusa facility. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, the jury heard a great deal of testimony regarding the nature of the\r\ndispute between the two parties, and was the ultimate decision maker as to the\r\nreasonableness and necessity of the attorney's fees incurred by Gaylord. Gaylord asks\r\nus to award the full amount of attorney's fees it claims it incurred as a result of Action\r\nBox's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit with prejudice.  Gaylord points to\r\ntestimony from its attorneys at trial and argues that the evidence conclusively\r\nestablished that it incurred $65,667.76 in attorney's fees and expenses as a result of\r\nAction Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit, and complains that the jury\r\nessentially awarded it nothing on attorney's fees.  We note, however, that the jury's\r\naward of $5,070 in response to Question 14 specifically included \"[t]he cost in\r\ndefending this lawsuit after Action Box failed to dismiss it, including but not limited\r\nto, attorney's fees and expenses associated with defending this suit.\"  Gaylord does\r\nnot complain on appeal that the question was improper.  Thus, under the plain\r\nlanguage of the question submitted, Gaylord did recover some of its attorney's fees\r\nrelated to Action Box's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurther, Gaylord's attorneys were subject to cross-examination on the amount\r\nof time they spent on the matters to which they testified, and the jury could have\r\nlegitimately found that the attorney's fees in excess of $5,070 were not reasonable in\r\nlight of the circumstances of this case, which included breaches of the Settlement\r\nAgreement by both parties and an admittedly long history of contention between\r\nGaylord and Action Box.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"The reasonableness of attorney's fees is ordinarily left to the factfinder, and\r\na reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for the jury's.\"</span><span></span><span><em>  Smith v.

(holding jury can award less than\r\nuncontradicted evidence supported for attorney's fees). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tThe evidence regarding attorney's fees Gaylord incurred was subject to cross-examination, and even Gaylord's own expert admitted that some of the time for which\r\nGaylord sought reimbursement was not recoverable.  Each side extensively cross-examined the other about which claims were recoverable and whether the attorneys\r\nhad properly segregated their time on the recoverable and non-recoverable claims. \r\nFurther, the attendant circumstances of this case--including but not limited to the\r\nnumber of lawyers for each side, especially Gaylord, who had three experts on\r\nattorney's fees alone; the protracted history of litigation between the parties; the\r\nquestionable conduct of each side in relation to the Settlement Agreement; and the\r\noverall harm, other than attorney's fees, that Gaylord suffered as a result of Action\r\nBox's failure to dismiss the Texas Lawsuit--could have reasonably supported the\r\njury's decision to award Gaylord less than the full amount of attorney's fees that it\r\nrequested.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Gaylord did not \"conclusively establish\" that it was entitled to\r\n$463,055.76 in damages, and because Question 14 included an award of attorney's\r\nfees to Gaylord, we find that the evidence supports the jury's award of $5,070 in\r\nGaylord's favor.  We overrule Gaylord's second issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span><strong>\t\tIV</strong></span><span></span><span>. \t</span><span></span><span><strong>Is there sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Action Box\r\ndid not breach the Settlement Agreement by failing to \"make a good faith\r\neffort to complete the Discount Program\" in a timely fashion?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tGaylord argues that Action Box did not present sufficient evidence that it\r\ncomplied with the ordering procedure set forth in the Settlement Agreement, and that\r\nGaylord is entitled to its \"conclusively established\" damages as a result. We construe\r\nthis as an attack on the jury's answer to Question 9.  Question 9 asked whether Action\r\nBox had breached the Settlement Agreement by failing to make a good faith effort to\r\ncomplete the Discount Program by November 30, 2004, or a reasonable time\r\nthereafter.  The jury answered, \"No.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile Gaylord argued otherwise during trial, Action Box's employees\r\nrepeatedly testified that they desired to have orders filled by the Bogalusa plant in an\r\neffort to fulfill the Discount Program and thus recoup some of the $70,000 in\r\ndiscounts to which Action Box was entitled under the Settlement Agreement. \r\nAlthough those orders did not always conform to the specifics of the products offered\r\nby the Bogalusa plant, the jury heard testimony and saw evidence that Action Box\r\nsubmitted orders to Bogalusa and to other competitors and that it fully intended to\r\ncomplete the Discount Program within the required time frame.  Gaylord failed to\r\nconclusively establish that Action Box breached the Settlement Agreement by failing\r\nto make a good faith effort to complete the Discount Program by November 30, 2004,\r\nor a reasonable time thereafter, and there is sufficient evidence to support the jury's\r\nverdict.  Accordingly, we overrule Gaylord's third issue on appeal. </span><span></span><span> </span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\t\t </span><span></span><span><strong>V. \tIs there sufficient evidence to support judgment on Action Box's breach\r\nof contract against Gaylord for breach of the Settlement Agreement?  </strong></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>\tIn its fourth point of error, Gaylord argues that the jury's finding that it\r\nbreached the Settlement Agreement when it failed to fulfill Action Box's October 14,\r\n2004 and January 14, 2005 orders is not supported by sufficient evidence.  Because \r\nthe evidence supports the jury's finding that Action Box was the first party to\r\nmaterially breach the Settlement Agreement, any subsequent breaches by Gaylord\r\nwere then excused as a matter of law.  Accordingly, we do not reach this issue.</span><span></span><span><strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>VI.\tDid the trial court err by failing to award Action Box its attorney's fees\r\nfor appeal?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span>\tWe next turn to Action Box's cross-issue on appeal.</span><span></span><span><sup> (3)</sup></span><span></span><span></span><span>  Action Box argues that\r\nthe trial court erred by failing to include any amount for appellate attorney's fees in\r\nthe judgment in favor of Action Box.  Because we have found that the evidence\r\nsupports the jury's finding that Action Box was the first party to materially breach the\r\nSettlement Agreement, Action Box is not entitled to recover its attorney's fees. \r\nAccordingly, we overrule Action Box's issue on appeal. \t</span><span></span><span><strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tWe sustain Gaylord's first issue on appeal and reverse the trial court's JNOV\r\nin favor of Action Box.  We overrule Gaylord's second, third and fourth issues on\r\nappeal.  In accordance with the jury's findings that both parties materially breached\r\nthe Settlement Agreement, that Action Box was the party that committed the first\r\nmaterial breach, and that Gaylord suffered $5,070.00 in damages, including attorney's\r\nfees, as a result of Action Box's material breach, we render judgment in favor of\r\nGaylord in the amount of $5,070.00.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span></span><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tGeorge C.
