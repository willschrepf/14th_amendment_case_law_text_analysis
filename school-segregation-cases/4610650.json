Congress created the\nIDEA to bring disabled students into the public education\nsystem by requiring states to adopt procedures to develop\nindividualized plans for such students. Students with\ndisabilities are entitled to special education services to ensure\nthat they receive a “free and appropriate public education”\n(“FAPE”).\n\n    The Pittsburg Unified School District (“School District”)\ndetermined that L.J. was not entitled to special education\nservices because he was not disabled, and its determination\nwas upheld on administrative review. L.J.’s mother filed this\naction in federal district court to require the School District to\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   5\n\nprovide L.J. with an Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) to\nprovide specialized services to assist with what she contends\nare serious disabilities.\n\n    The district court reviewed the record and found that L.J.\nwas disabled under three categories defined by the IDEA. It\nnevertheless concluded that an IEP for specialized services\nwas not necessary because of L.J.’s satisfactory performance\nin general education classes. The court discounted L.J.’s\nsuicide attempts as not bearing on the need for educational\nservices because they took place outside of school.\n\n    The school records show, however, that beginning in the\nsecond grade and continuing into the third and fourth grades,\nwhen the parent invoked administrative remedies, the School\nDistrict had already been providing L.J. with special services,\nincluding counseling, one-on-one assistance, and instructional\naccommodations. These services resulted in L.J.’s materially\nimproved performance. The School District consistently\nrefused, however, to provide him with an IEP that would\nensure such services in the future as required by the IDEA.\nThe record also reflects that the School District violated\nprocedural protections of the IDEA by failing to provide the\nparents with education records bearing on L.J.’s disabilities\nand services that had been provided. We therefore reverse\nand remand for consideration of appropriate remedies.\n\n                     BACKGROUND\n\n    This case presents a bright child’s disturbingly troubled\nhistory in the primary grades of two through five. L.J. was\nsuspended from school multiple times for disruptive behavior\nthat included kicking and hitting his teachers, throwing rocks,\ncalling teachers and students names, and endangering and\n\f6                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nphysically injuring classmates. L.J. has attempted to kill\nhimself on at least three occasions and has manifested\nsuicidal ideations prompting the School District’s mental\nhealth providers to conduct at least one emergency suicide\nevaluation. L.J. has been diagnosed with three serious\ndisorders, including Bipolar Disorder, Oppositional Defiant\nDisorder (“ODD”), and ADHD. He has been prescribed a\ncocktail of serious medications for these conditions.\n\n    For years, L.J.’s mother has repeatedly requested, to no\navail, that the School District find L.J. eligible for special\neducation. The School District has provided many services\nto L.J., but has never classified L.J. as eligible for special\neducation under the IDEA. Without such eligibility, L.J. is\nnot guaranteed the services his mother believes that he needs,\nsuch as one-on-one educational therapy, counseling services,\nand behavior intervention services. Instead, the School\nDistrict has transferred him between at least three different\nschools.\n\n    The history of L.J.’s difficulties began in second grade.\nDuring this year, L.J. demonstrated inappropriate behaviors\nat school, including anger, lack of self-control, and not\nfollowing rules. After being verbally disciplined by his\nteacher for bullying other students, L.J. told her that he\nwanted to die and that life was too hard. School staff called\nL.J.’s mother, and mental health staff prepared an emergency\nsuicide evaluation. The School District referred L.J. to\nLincoln Child Center (“Lincoln”), the School District’s\ncounseling center, where mental health providers assessed\nhim. L.J. was diagnosed with ADHD, ODD, and Bipolar\nDisorder.\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                    7\n\n     L.J. began his third grade year at the same school, but\nexhibited negative behaviors which the teacher had difficulty\ncontrolling. The School District held a student study team\n(“SST”) meeting on September 7, 2011. The purpose of an\nSST is to develop interventions for students having trouble in\nschool, either academically or behaviorally. In many schools,\nan SST is the first step in addressing a student’s needs before\ninitiating the IEP process.\n\n    After L.J.’s SST meeting, the School District’s behavior\nspecialist created a behavioral support plan (“BSP”) to\naddress his problematic behavior. Over the course of the\nschool year, the behavior specialist revised the BSP multiple\ntimes, but L.J. continued to act inappropriately. As a result\nof the failed BSP, the School District proposed moving L.J.\nto a segregated trailer at a different school, but with no\nspecial education services, with six other African-American\nboys with extreme behavior problems.\n\n    L.J.’s mother disputed the move, retained counsel, and\nentered mediation. The parties settled by agreeing to place\nL.J., temporarily, in a different school, in a general education\nclass, conditioned on his having a one-to-one behavioral aide.\nThe School District also agreed to evaluate L.J. for special\neducation.\n\n    At the new school, a paraeducator was assigned to work\nwith L.J. one-on-one, and continued to work with him\nthrough his third grade year. A paraeducator is a specially\ntrained staff member, assigned to work with special education\nstudents.      While L.J. progressed academically and\nbehaviorally, he continued to have issues. In April 2012, L.J.\nwrapped a seatbelt around his neck, and saying he wanted to\n\f8                 L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\ndie, began rolling around uncontrollably trying to rub his face\non the ground. L.J. was taken to the emergency room.\n\n    Also, pursuant to the settlement agreement, Dr. Sherry\nBurke, a school psychologist, conducted psychoeducational\nand functional analysis assessments of L.J. to assist the IEP\nteam in determining if he qualified for special education\nunder the categories of other health impairment, or specific\nlearning disability. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.8(c)(9), (10). Dr.\nBurke reviewed available school records, conducted various\ninterviews of L.J.’s teachers, counselors, and family\nmembers, and administered a series of tests. She concluded\nthat L.J. did not meet the eligibility criteria for special\neducation.\n\n    On May 29, 2012, L.J. again attempted to kill himself by\nsticking his finger in a light socket and putting items down\nhis throat. He said that everyone hated him and he did not\nwant to live. He was then confined to a psychiatric hospital,\ncausing him to miss six school days.\n\n    The next day, May 30, 2012, while L.J. was hospitalized,\nthe IEP team held a meeting to review L.J.’s assessment\nresults and to make a special education eligibility\ndetermination. An IEP team is composed of School District\nteachers, the parent and other experts familiar with the child.\nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B). Dr. Burke presented her\nfindings to the IEP team, including her recommendation that\nL.J. did not meet eligibility requirements. The IEP team\nagreed with the psychologist that L.J. had no qualifying\ndisabilities.\n\n   The next month, on June 25, 2012, L.J.’s mother formally\nrequested all of L.J.’s school records from the School District,\n\f                 L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   9\n\nincluding any records from Lincoln, where L.J. had received\ncounseling and had been assessed. The School District\nclaimed there were no Lincoln records that had not already\nbeen disclosed. L.J.’s mother submitted another request for\nL.J.’s records on June 28. The School District again failed to\ndisclose any further records.\n\n    L.J. was admitted for psychiatric hospitalization on July\n17 and again on July 26, when he was detained as a danger to\nhimself or others for banging his head and making threats.\nDoctors placed L.J. on the psychotropic medications,\nAdderall, Seroquel, and Wellbutrin, to help stabilize his mood\nand sustain focus, and later Vistaril to treat his anxiety.\n\n    On July 27, 2012, L.J.’s mother filed a request for a due\nprocess hearing with the California Office of Administrative\nHearings (“OAH”). She claimed that the School District\ndenied L.J. a FAPE by failing to make him eligible for special\neducation and related services, and that the School District\nhad failed to conduct assessments in areas of suspected\ndisability, specifically other health impairment and emotional\ndisturbance. L.J.’s mother also contended that the School\nDistrict had failed to make requested records available.\n\n    The parties again participated in mediation on August 23,\n2012. The parties agreed to place L.J. at yet another\nelementary school, pending the School District’s review of\nL.J.’s psychiatric hospitalization records and Dr. Burke’s\nupdating her report. The School District generated a new\nAssessment Plan for IEP eligibility purposes. L.J.’s mother\nauthorized the release of L.J.’s psychiatric records on the\ncondition that a school nurse would conduct a health\nassessment and that L.J.’s original third grade teacher would\nbe included in the eligibility process.\n\f10               L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\n    For fourth grade, beginning in the fall of 2012, L.J. was\nin a classroom with a teacher experienced with students with\ndisciplinary problems. L.J. was also provided with special\naccommodations, including freedom to leave the classroom\nat will. On September 25, 2012, L.J. was suspended for two\ndays for throwing rocks and threatening to kill the school’s\nprincipal. The teacher’s one-on-one assistance and special\naccommodations continued throughout the school year, and,\nas a result, L.J.’s academic performance was satisfactory.\n\n    After Dr. Burke updated her assessments, a second IEP\nteam meeting was held on October 9, 2012, to reconsider\nL.J.’s eligibility for special education services under the\ncategory of emotional disturbance.           See 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.8(c)(4). The requested third grade teacher was not\npresent at the meeting and L.J. had not been assessed by a\nnurse, in violation of both conditions insisted upon by L.J.’s\nmother in the agreement. The team again concluded that L.J.\nwas not eligible for special education, the same conclusion\nreached at the first meeting the preceding May, despite\nrepeated intervening hospitalizations, heavy medications,\nrenewed suicide attempts, and individualized\naccommodations in school.\n\n    On October 15, 2012, L.J. filed an amended complaint\nwith the California OAH. L.J.’s mother again submitted\nformal requests for L.J.’s school records in October and\nNovember 2012, and in March 2013. The mental health\nrecords kept by the School District, including Lincoln, were\nnever disclosed.\n\n    During that fourth grade year, L.J. was sent to the office\nmultiple times for physically injuring classmates, disrupting\nclass, and refusing to follow directives. School staff\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   11\n\ncontacted L.J.’s mother to pick him up from school early on\nnumerous occasions. The School District conducted another\nmental health assessment. He was again diagnosed with\nADHD. In this assessment, the clinician concluded his\nADHD symptoms caused clinically significant impairment in\nL.J.’s social and academic functioning, that L.J. relied\nextensively on medications, and further, that he evidenced\nfunctional impairments in the areas of family relations, school\nperformance, and peer relations.\n\n    The following year, in the fall of 2013, the School District\nnevertheless placed L.J. in a regular fifth grade classroom\nwithout accommodations or services. In November, L.J. was\nrushed to the emergency room by ambulance after attempting\nto hang himself with a lanyard. That year, L.J. physically\ninjured children and at least one teacher. L.J. was suspended\nfor “kicking and hitting” his science teacher, calling another\nteacher “stupid,” and brandishing a fake knife in the\nclassroom. L.J. was also suspended again because he\nendangered a classmate by putting expandable pellets in the\nclassmate’s water bottle without his knowledge.\n\n    That spring, L.J.’s due process request made its way\nbefore an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”). The ALJ\nconducted a three-day hearing in April, and on May 23, 2013,\nthe ALJ issued her decision, denying all of L.J.’s requests for\nrelief. The ALJ found that L.J. had no disabilities that would\nqualify him for special education services, and even if he had\nqualifying disabilities, he had not demonstrated a need for\nspecial services because his academic performance was\nsatisfactory when he was able to attend school.\n\f12                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\n            PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n    L.J. timely appealed the ALJ’s ruling to the district court.\nL.J. contended that he was eligible for special education\nservices and asked the district court to order the School\nDistrict to provide an IEP. The parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment. The district court disagreed with the\nALJ’s decision that L.J. had no disabling conditions. The\ndistrict court ruled that L.J. met the qualifying criteria as a\nstudent with three disabilities: specific learning disability,\nother health impairment (due to his ADHD), and serious\nemotional disturbance (due to his ODD and bipolar disorder).\n\n    The district court, nevertheless, granted the School\nDistrict’s motion for summary judgment, ruling that L.J. did\nnot need special education services because of his satisfactory\nperformance in general education. The district court adopted\nthe ALJ’s findings that L.J. was performing well\nbehaviorally, socially, and academically between May and\nOctober 2012 with the help of services the court characterized\nas general education accommodations, not individualized\nspecial education services.\n\n     This appeal followed.\n\n                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n    The district court’s findings of fact are reviewed for clear\nerror, even when the district court based those findings on an\nadministrative record, and conclusions of law are reviewed de\nnovo. J.G. v. Douglas Cty. Sch. Dist., 552 F.3d 786, 793 (9th\nCir. 2008). This court gives “due weight” to ALJ special\neducation decisions. J.W. v. Fresno Unified Sch. Dist.,\n626 F.3d 431, 440–41 (9th Cir. 2010). This standard is far\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                  13\n\nless deferential than judicial review of other agency actions,\nbut requires this court to refrain from substituting its own\nnotions of educational policy for those of the school authority\nit reviews. Amanda J. v. Clark Cty. Sch. Dist., 267 F.3d 877,\n887–88 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\nI. Statutory Background and Legal Framework\n\n    Under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400–1491, all states that\nreceive federal education funding must establish policies and\nprocedures to ensure that a “free appropriate public education\nis available to all children with disabilities.” Id. at\n§ 1412(a)(1)(A). The IDEA defines a FAPE as “special\neducation” that is provided at public expense. Id. at\n§ 1401(9). A child receives a FAPE, for purposes of the\nIDEA, if the program addresses the child’s unique needs,\nprovides adequate support services so that the child can take\nadvantage of educational opportunities, and is in accord with\nthe IEP. Id. A state must comply both procedurally and\nsubstantively with the IDEA. Id. at § 1400 et seq.\n\n    In determining whether a student has received a FAPE in\ncompliance with the IDEA, the court conducts both a\nprocedural and substantive inquiry. The court considers\nwhether the school complied with the procedures set forth in\nthe IDEA. Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206–07\n(1982). The court also evaluates whether the IEP in this case,\nor lack thereof, was reasonably calculated to enable the child\nto receive educational benefits. Id. Where a court identifies\na procedural violation that denied a student a FAPE, the court\nneed not address the second substantive prong of the inquiry.\nDoug C. v. Haw. Dep’t. of Educ., 720 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th\nCir. 2013).\n\f14                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\n    Not all procedural violations constitute a denial of a\nFAPE. R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified Sch. Dist., 496 F.3d 932,\n938 (9th Cir. 2007). A child is denied a FAPE when\nprocedural inadequacies result in the loss of an educational\nopportunity, or seriously infringe on the parents’ opportunity\nto participate in the IEP formulation process. Doug C.,\n720 F.3d at 1043. A procedural error is harmless if the\nstudent is substantively ineligible for IDEA benefits. R.B.,\n496 F.3d at 942.\n\nII. Eligibility for IDEA Benefits\n\n    The initial issue in this case is whether L.J. was\nsubstantively eligible for IDEA benefits, since the ALJ held\nhe was not. A child is substantively eligible for special\neducation and related services if he is a “child with a\ndisability,” which is statutorily defined, in relevant part, as a\nchild with a serious emotional disturbance, other health\nimpairment, or specific learning disability and who, by reason\nthereof, needs special education and related services.\n20 U.S.C. § 1401(3)(A). California Education Code similarly\nprovides that a “student with exceptional needs” who is\neligible under § 1401(3)(A) must have an impairment that\n“requires instruction and services which cannot be provided\nwith modification of the regular school program.” Cal. Educ.\nCode §§ 56026(a), (b).\n\n    Even if a child has such a disability, he or she does not\nqualify for special education services if support provided\nthrough the regular school program is sufficient. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1401(3)(A); Cal. Educ. Code § 56026. “[S]pecial classes,\nseparate schooling, or other removal of children with\ndisabilities from the regular educational environment occurs\nonly when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   15\n\nsuch that education in regular classes with the use of\nsupplementary aids and services cannot be achieved\nsatisfactorily.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A).\n\n    The parties on appeal no longer dispute that L.J. should\nhave been categorized as a child with a disability under three\ncategories set forth in the statute. First, L.J. has a “specific\nlearning disability” because he has exhibited a severe\ndiscrepancy between his intellectual ability and his\nachievement. 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(10). Second, L.J. has an\n“other health impairment” because his ADHD and mood\ndisorders interfere with his ability to progress academically\nand socially. 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(9). Lastly, L.J.’s mood\ndisorders constitute a “serious emotional disturbance.” 34\nC.F.R. § 300.8(c)(4).\n\n    The critical issue in this appeal therefore is whether L.J.\ndemonstrated a need for special education services. This case\ndiffers from most IDEA cases in that L.J. never received an\nIEP because the School District continually maintained he\nhad no qualifying disabilities. The ALJ agreed that he had no\nqualifying disabilities. The district court held that the ALJ\nwas incorrect in this regard and that L.J. had qualifying\ndisabilities. The district court went on to conclude, however,\nthat L.J. was performing satisfactorily without the need for\nspecial education services. We must therefore determine\nwhether general education was appropriate or whether L.J.\nexhibited a need for special education services.\n\n    The appropriateness of a student’s eligibility should be\nassessed in terms of its appropriateness at the time of the\nchild’s evaluation and not from the perspective of a later time\nwith the benefit of hindsight. Adams v. Oregon, 195 F.3d\n1141, 1149 (9th Cir. 1999). When making this assessment of\n\f16                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nwhether an eligibility determination is “appropriate” under\nthe IDEA, this court looks to the time of the child’s\nevaluation by the School District. We employ what is termed\nthe “snapshot” rule that instructs the court to judge the\nappropriateness of the determination on the basis of the\ninformation reasonably available to the parties at the time of\nthe IEP meeting. Id. “An IEP must take into account what\nwas and was not, objectively reasonable when the snapshot\nwas taken.” Id. (citation omitted). We judge the eligibility\ndecision on the basis of whether it took the relevant\ninformation into account, not on whether or not it worked. Id.\n\n     In this case, it is undisputed that the snapshot period was\nthe period surrounding the two IEP meetings: on May 30,\n2012, in the third grade, and October 9, 2012, in the fourth\ngrade. That was the critical period on which the School\nDistrict based its eligibility decisions, and the district court\ncorrectly focused on L.J.’s eligibility for special education by\nlooking to his behavior, academic progress, and social needs\nat that time. The district court was correct when it found that\nL.J. should have been categorized as a child with a disability\nwithin the meaning of the IDEA. L.J. had multiple\ndisabilities, which manifested serious behavioral problems.\n\n    The district court nonetheless concluded that L.J. was not\neligible for special education because he was academically\nperforming satisfactorily without receiving special education\nservices and on the basis of the general education curriculum.\nThis was clear error because L.J. was receiving special\nservices, including mental health counseling and assistance\nfrom a one-on-one paraeducator. These are not services\noffered to general education students.\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                  17\n\n    This distinction is important. General education is what\nis provided to non-disabled children in the classroom.\nSpecial education, on the other hand, is “specially designed\ninstruction” to meet the unique needs of a child with a\ndisability. 34 C.F.R. § 300.39(a)(1). “Specially designed\ninstruction” is defined under the IDEA regulations:\n\n       Specially designed instruction means\n       adapting, as appropriate to the needs of an\n       eligible child under this part, the content,\n       methodology, or delivery of instruction—\n\n           (i) To address the unique needs of the\n       child that result from the child’s disability;\n       and\n\n            (ii) To ensure access of the child to the\n       general curriculum, so that the child can meet\n       the educational standards within the\n       jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to\n       all children.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.39(b)(3) (emphasis added).\n\n    The district court decided that L.J. did not need an IEP\nbecause, despite his multiple disabilities, L.J. was performing\nsatisfactorily in general education. The problem with the\ndistrict court’s analysis is that many of the services the\ndistrict court viewed as general education services were in\nfact special education services tailored to L.J.’s situation.\nThe district court thus classified many of the services L.J.\nreceived as general education, when they were not.\nDiscussion of a few examples will make the point.\n\f18                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\n    First, general education instruction does not provide for\none-on-one direction. L.J. received special assistance in the\nthird grade from a one-on-one paraeducator, pursuant to the\nparties agreement that year. The School District claims that\nthe paraeducator “faded back considerably” by May 30, the\ndate of the initial IEP meeting, but this is not accurate. The\nparaeducator continued to assist L.J. throughout the third\ngrade.\n\n    Second, general education instruction does not provide for\nspecially designed mental health services. The School\nDistrict’s position is that L.J. received only general education\nmental health services from Lincoln that the School District\nmakes available to all students. The School District\ndistinguishes such services from services received by special\neducation students, which are specially designed mental\nhealth services.\n\n    The flaw in the School District’s argument is that the\nmental health services that L.J. received from second grade\nthrough fourth grade were specially-designed for him. Such\nservices included services that the School District described\nas follows: Assessments, Plan Development, Group and\nIndividual Rehabilitation, Group and Individual Therapy,\nFamily Therapy, and Collateral Family Group and Intensive\nHome-Based Services. The School District acknowledges\nthat only students requiring special education receive an\neducationally-related mental health assessment. L.J. received\ntwo such mental health assessments. L.J. was referred to\nLincoln by the School District’s Director of Special\nEducation and Psychological Services, and the School\nDistrict acknowledged this means of referral is for special\neducation students only.\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   19\n\n    Third, general education instruction does not typically\ninclude extensive clinical interventions by a School District\nbehavior specialist. While it is not unusual for a behavior\nspecialist to offer support to a general education teacher, here\nthe School District’s behavior specialist did much more.\nThroughout the third grade year, he designed specific BSPs\nin an attempt to meet L.J.’s needs. The plans included\nadapting the method and delivery of L.J.’s instruction, and\nstrategies to promote a structured environment and reinforce\npositive behavior. The behavior specialist also designed a\nnine-hour training session for L.J.’s paraeducator. After\ntraining L.J.’s aide, the behavior specialist closely supervised\nhim to ensure the interventions followed the new BSP.\n\n    The district court clearly erred by mischaracterizing all of\nthese individualized services as general education available\nto all students, rather than as special education provided to\nstudents with disabilities. The court went on to conclude,\nerroneously, that L.J. did not require specialized assistance in\nthe future on the ground that he was no longer exhibiting\nbehaviors that interfered with his school performance.\nGranted, his condition had improved during the snapshot\nperiod, for by the time of the IEP meetings, L.J.’s\nimpairments had been eased with the accommodations and\nservices provided by the School District. With the assistance\nof medication and specially designed instruction, L.J. had\nperiods of temporary behavioral and academic gain. L.J.’s\nteachers, service providers, and mother all reported that L.J.\nhad made good progress in academics and improved his\nsocial skills with his classmates during the snapshot period.\n\n    Dr. Burke opined that his average or above-average\nacademic testing scores showed academic achievement had\nnot been impacted by any of his issues. Standardized tests\n\f20               L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nranked L.J.’s academic performance in an overall average\nrange. Although there was progress, it was no doubt in a\nsetting where multiple services were being provided and the\nprogress must at least, in substantial part, be attributed to\nthose services. Moreover, L.J. has shown himself to be an\nintelligent child, so his academic performance could have\nbeen even more improved with the appropriate specially\ndesigned instruction.\n\n   Yet, L.J. continued to have troubling behavioral and\nacademic issues during the snapshot period. The district\ncourt did not adequately take these into account when it\ndecided there was no need for future specialized services.\nThe information available to the IEP team during the\nsnapshot period was dramatic.\n\n    L.J. threatened and attempted to kill himself on numerous\noccasions. On May 29, 2012, the day before his initial IEP\nmeeting, L.J. attempted to kill himself by sticking his finger\nin a light socket and putting items down his throat. On May\n30, 2012, the day of his first eligibility determination, L.J.\ncould not have been doing well socially, behaviorally, or\nacademically at school because he was in extended care at a\npsychiatric hospital. He was confined to the hospital for over\na week and missed at least six school days. L.J. was again\nadmitted for psychiatric hospitalization on July 17 and July\n26, 2012. L.J. was detained as a danger to himself or others\nbecause he was banging his head against walls and making\nthreats of harm.\n\n    The district court concluded that L.J.’s psychiatric\nhospitalizations and suicide attempts were not relevant to his\neligibility for specialized instruction because they occurred\noutside the school environment. Yet, the issue is whether his\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                  21\n\ndisabilities interfered with his education and necessitated\nspecial services. It is hard to imagine how an emotional\ndisturbance so severe that it resulted in repeated suicide\nattempts would not interfere with school performance. That\nhe attempted suicide outside the school environment is\nimmaterial. His emotional disturbance adversely affected his\nattendance and his teachers all reported that L.J.’s classroom\nabsences, due to psychiatric hospitalizations, hurt his\nacademic performance. To distinguish between where a\nstudent attempted suicide—between home and\nschool—misses the point. The point being that whether\nhaving a suicidal ideation and attempting suicide interfered\nwith L.J.’s education.\n\n    In fourth grade, in September, L.J. was suspended for two\ndays after throwing rocks at and threatening to kill the school\nprincipal. The district court did not think his suspension was\nof great import, noting that it was only for two days. But this\nwas not L.J.’s only incident. Shortly before the October 9,\n2012, IEP meeting, L.J. was unable to ride the school bus\nbecause he refused to follow the bus driver’s directions.\n\n    L.J. also continually had needs associated with his\nmedication and treatment for his mood disorders and ADHD.\nBy fourth grade, L.J. relied on psychotropic medications in\norder to attend school. His fourth grade teacher reported that\nL.J.’s functioning declined in the absence of medication or\nwhen it had no mitigating effects. School counselors\nrepeatedly expressed their concern regarding L.J.’s\nmedication management. The district court neglected to\ndiscuss L.J.’s ongoing needs associated with his medication.\n\n   L.J. clearly exhibited behavioral and academic difficulty\nduring the snapshot period. He threatened and attempted to\n\f22                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nkill himself on three occasions in 2012. In the fall, he\nfrequently acted out at school, and continued to have needs\nassociated with his medication regimen. The district court\nshould not have discounted these facts. They demonstrate\nthat L.J. required special education services.\n\n   Because L.J. is eligible for special education, the School\nDistrict must formulate an IEP. We reverse the district\ncourt’s decision and remand for it to order that the School\nDistrict provide that remedy.\n\nIII.   Procedural Violations of the IDEA\n\n    Procedural safeguards are built into the IDEA to ensure\nthat a child’s education is fair and appropriate and the parents\nhave an opportunity to participate in the IEP formulation\nprocess. Doug C., 720 F.3d at 1043. The record in this case\nreflects some serious violations of these safeguards by the\nSchool District.\n\n    The School District failed to disclose assessments,\ntreatment plans, and progress notes from L.J.’s time at\nLincoln. The district court erred in concluding that this\nfailure did not interfere with L.J.’s mother’s opportunity to\nparticipate in the IEP formulation process.\n\n    Under the IDEA, parents have the right to informed\nconsent. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(1)(D). Consent means that the\nparent has been fully informed of all information relevant to\nthe activity for which consent is sought. 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.9(a). To guarantee parents the ability to make informed\ndecisions about their child’s education, the IDEA gives them\nthe right to examine all pertinent education records relating\nto their child. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1). The Lincoln records\n\f                   L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                    23\n\nconstitute such education records and should have been\ndisclosed to L.J.’s mother.\n\n    Parents also have the right to invite to attend IEP\nmeetings individuals with knowledge or special expertise\nregarding their child. 34 C.F.R. § 300.321(a)(6). L.J.’s\nmother had the right to have L.J.’s mental health providers at\nboth the May and October IEP meetings. Id. Without\nknowledge of the Lincoln records, however, L.J.’s mother\nwaived the attendance of his mental health clinicians at the\nIEP meetings. At the very least, L.J.’s parent should have\nreceived complete copies of the Lincoln records so that she\ncould provide informed consent regarding the exclusion of his\nmental health providers from the IEP team. Had L.J.’s\nmother been aware of the content of the Lincoln records, she\nmay well not have waived the mental health providers’\nattendance.\n\n    The School District also failed to conduct a health\nassessment for the purpose of determining how L.J.’s health,\nand particularly his medications, affected his performance.\nThe district court held that this error did not infringe on L.J.’s\nmother’s ability to participate in the IEP process because\nL.J.’s medications were not administered at school. We fail\nto see that the need for a health assessment should depend on\nwhere medications are administered, and we are cited to\nnothing in support of the proposition.\n\n    Under the IDEA, the School District must conduct a “full\nand initial evaluation,” one which ensures the child is\nassessed in “all areas of suspected disability.” 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1414(a)(1)(A), (b)(3)(B). This requirement allows the\nchild’s IEP team to have a complete picture of the child’s\nfunctional, developmental, and academic needs. When a\n\f24                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nstudent has been diagnosed as having a chronic illness, as L.J.\nwas, the student may be referred to the School District for a\nhealth assessment. 5 Cal. Code Reg. § 3021.1. A health\nassessment focuses on diagnoses, health history, and those\nspecific health needs while in school which are necessary to\nassist a child with a disability. The regulations then require\nthat the IEP team review, among other things, the “possible\nmedical side effects and complications of treatment that could\naffect school functioning.” Id. The district court erred when\nit dismissed the School District’s failure to conduct a health\nassessment, depriving L.J. of an educational benefit. See\nDoug C., 720 F.3d at 1043 (a FAPE is denied where\nprocedural inadequacies result in loss of educational\nbenefits).\n\n    Here, there is reason to believe that alternative services\nwould have at least been more seriously considered during\nthe IEP process if the School District had assessed L.J.’s\nhealth, including the effects of his medication on his health.\nThe record evidence showed that L.J. continually had needs\nassociated with his medication and treatment, which\nadversely impacted his academic, behavioral, and social\nperformance. Because his health and the impacts of his\nmedication were never assessed, no matter what assistance\nL.J. received, the School District would remain unable to\nappropriately address those needs.\n\n    In sum, the School District clearly violated important\nprocedural safeguards set forth in the IDEA. The School\nDistrict failed to disclose assessments, treatment plans, and\nprogress notes kept by Lincoln, which deprived L.J.’s mother\nof her right to informed consent. The School District also\nfailed to conduct a health assessment, which rendered the\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                  25\n\nSchool District and IEP team unable to evaluate and address\nL.J.’s medication and treatment related needs.\n\n     When this matter returns to the School District for the\npreparation of an IEP, the School District must comply with\nthe IDEA’s procedural safeguards. Additional procedural\nviolations can only result in the further protraction of\nproceedings and costly financial and emotional burdens for\nall those involved.\n\n                      CONCLUSION\n\n    L.J. is a child with disabilities within the meaning of the\nIDEA and needs special education. The judgment of the\ndistrict court is reversed and the matter remanded to the\ndistrict court with instruction to order the School District to\nprovide an appropriate remedy.\n\n   Costs are awarded to Plaintiffs-Appellants.\n\n   REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f",

Congress created the\nIDEA to bring disabled students into the public education\nsystem by requiring states to adopt procedures to develop\nindividualized plans for such students. Students with\ndisabilities are entitled to special education services to ensure\nthat they receive a “free and appropriate public education”\n(“FAPE”).\n\n    The Pittsburg Unified School District (“School District”)\ndetermined that L.J. was not entitled to special education\nservices because he was not disabled, and its determination\nwas upheld on administrative review. L.J.’s mother filed this\naction in federal district court to require the School District to\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   5\n\nprovide L.J. with an Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) to\nprovide specialized services to assist with what she contends\nare serious disabilities.\n\n    The district court reviewed the record and found that L.J.\nwas disabled under three categories defined by the IDEA. It\nnevertheless concluded that an IEP for specialized services\nwas not necessary because of L.J.’s satisfactory performance\nin general education classes. The court discounted L.J.’s\nsuicide attempts as not bearing on the need for educational\nservices because they took place outside of school.\n\n    The school records show, however, that beginning in the\nsecond grade and continuing into the third and fourth grades,\nwhen the parent invoked administrative remedies, the School\nDistrict had already been providing L.J. with special services,\nincluding counseling, one-on-one assistance, and instructional\naccommodations. These services resulted in L.J.’s materially\nimproved performance. The School District consistently\nrefused, however, to provide him with an IEP that would\nensure such services in the future as required by the IDEA.\nThe record also reflects that the School District violated\nprocedural protections of the IDEA by failing to provide the\nparents with education records bearing on L.J.’s disabilities\nand services that had been provided. We therefore reverse\nand remand for consideration of appropriate remedies.\n\n                     BACKGROUND\n\n    This case presents a bright child’s disturbingly troubled\nhistory in the primary grades of two through five. L.J. was\nsuspended from school multiple times for disruptive behavior\nthat included kicking and hitting his teachers, throwing rocks,\ncalling teachers and students names, and endangering and\n\f6                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nphysically injuring classmates. L.J. has attempted to kill\nhimself on at least three occasions and has manifested\nsuicidal ideations prompting the School District’s mental\nhealth providers to conduct at least one emergency suicide\nevaluation. L.J. has been diagnosed with three serious\ndisorders, including Bipolar Disorder, Oppositional Defiant\nDisorder (“ODD”), and ADHD. He has been prescribed a\ncocktail of serious medications for these conditions.\n\n    For years, L.J.’s mother has repeatedly requested, to no\navail, that the School District find L.J. eligible for special\neducation. The School District has provided many services\nto L.J., but has never classified L.J. as eligible for special\neducation under the IDEA. Without such eligibility, L.J. is\nnot guaranteed the services his mother believes that he needs,\nsuch as one-on-one educational therapy, counseling services,\nand behavior intervention services. Instead, the School\nDistrict has transferred him between at least three different\nschools.\n\n    The history of L.J.’s difficulties began in second grade.\nDuring this year, L.J. demonstrated inappropriate behaviors\nat school, including anger, lack of self-control, and not\nfollowing rules. After being verbally disciplined by his\nteacher for bullying other students, L.J. told her that he\nwanted to die and that life was too hard. School staff called\nL.J.’s mother, and mental health staff prepared an emergency\nsuicide evaluation. The School District referred L.J. to\nLincoln Child Center (“Lincoln”), the School District’s\ncounseling center, where mental health providers assessed\nhim. L.J. was diagnosed with ADHD, ODD, and Bipolar\nDisorder.\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                    7\n\n     L.J. began his third grade year at the same school, but\nexhibited negative behaviors which the teacher had difficulty\ncontrolling. The School District held a student study team\n(“SST”) meeting on September 7, 2011. The purpose of an\nSST is to develop interventions for students having trouble in\nschool, either academically or behaviorally. In many schools,\nan SST is the first step in addressing a student’s needs before\ninitiating the IEP process.\n\n    After L.J.’s SST meeting, the School District’s behavior\nspecialist created a behavioral support plan (“BSP”) to\naddress his problematic behavior. Over the course of the\nschool year, the behavior specialist revised the BSP multiple\ntimes, but L.J. continued to act inappropriately. As a result\nof the failed BSP, the School District proposed moving L.J.\nto a segregated trailer at a different school, but with no\nspecial education services, with six other African-American\nboys with extreme behavior problems.\n\n    L.J.’s mother disputed the move, retained counsel, and\nentered mediation. The parties settled by agreeing to place\nL.J., temporarily, in a different school, in a general education\nclass, conditioned on his having a one-to-one behavioral aide.\nThe School District also agreed to evaluate L.J. for special\neducation.\n\n    At the new school, a paraeducator was assigned to work\nwith L.J. one-on-one, and continued to work with him\nthrough his third grade year. A paraeducator is a specially\ntrained staff member, assigned to work with special education\nstudents.      While L.J. progressed academically and\nbehaviorally, he continued to have issues. In April 2012, L.J.\nwrapped a seatbelt around his neck, and saying he wanted to\n\f8                 L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\ndie, began rolling around uncontrollably trying to rub his face\non the ground. L.J. was taken to the emergency room.\n\n    Also, pursuant to the settlement agreement, Dr. Sherry\nBurke, a school psychologist, conducted psychoeducational\nand functional analysis assessments of L.J. to assist the IEP\nteam in determining if he qualified for special education\nunder the categories of other health impairment, or specific\nlearning disability. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.8(c)(9), (10). Dr.\nBurke reviewed available school records, conducted various\ninterviews of L.J.’s teachers, counselors, and family\nmembers, and administered a series of tests. She concluded\nthat L.J. did not meet the eligibility criteria for special\neducation.\n\n    On May 29, 2012, L.J. again attempted to kill himself by\nsticking his finger in a light socket and putting items down\nhis throat. He said that everyone hated him and he did not\nwant to live. He was then confined to a psychiatric hospital,\ncausing him to miss six school days.\n\n    The next day, May 30, 2012, while L.J. was hospitalized,\nthe IEP team held a meeting to review L.J.’s assessment\nresults and to make a special education eligibility\ndetermination. An IEP team is composed of School District\nteachers, the parent and other experts familiar with the child.\nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B). Dr. Burke presented her\nfindings to the IEP team, including her recommendation that\nL.J. did not meet eligibility requirements. The IEP team\nagreed with the psychologist that L.J. had no qualifying\ndisabilities.\n\n   The next month, on June 25, 2012, L.J.’s mother formally\nrequested all of L.J.’s school records from the School District,\n\f                 L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   9\n\nincluding any records from Lincoln, where L.J. had received\ncounseling and had been assessed. The School District\nclaimed there were no Lincoln records that had not already\nbeen disclosed. L.J.’s mother submitted another request for\nL.J.’s records on June 28. The School District again failed to\ndisclose any further records.\n\n    L.J. was admitted for psychiatric hospitalization on July\n17 and again on July 26, when he was detained as a danger to\nhimself or others for banging his head and making threats.\nDoctors placed L.J. on the psychotropic medications,\nAdderall, Seroquel, and Wellbutrin, to help stabilize his mood\nand sustain focus, and later Vistaril to treat his anxiety.\n\n    On July 27, 2012, L.J.’s mother filed a request for a due\nprocess hearing with the California Office of Administrative\nHearings (“OAH”). She claimed that the School District\ndenied L.J. a FAPE by failing to make him eligible for special\neducation and related services, and that the School District\nhad failed to conduct assessments in areas of suspected\ndisability, specifically other health impairment and emotional\ndisturbance. L.J.’s mother also contended that the School\nDistrict had failed to make requested records available.\n\n    The parties again participated in mediation on August 23,\n2012. The parties agreed to place L.J. at yet another\nelementary school, pending the School District’s review of\nL.J.’s psychiatric hospitalization records and Dr. Burke’s\nupdating her report. The School District generated a new\nAssessment Plan for IEP eligibility purposes. L.J.’s mother\nauthorized the release of L.J.’s psychiatric records on the\ncondition that a school nurse would conduct a health\nassessment and that L.J.’s original third grade teacher would\nbe included in the eligibility process.\n\f10               L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\n    For fourth grade, beginning in the fall of 2012, L.J. was\nin a classroom with a teacher experienced with students with\ndisciplinary problems. L.J. was also provided with special\naccommodations, including freedom to leave the classroom\nat will. On September 25, 2012, L.J. was suspended for two\ndays for throwing rocks and threatening to kill the school’s\nprincipal. The teacher’s one-on-one assistance and special\naccommodations continued throughout the school year, and,\nas a result, L.J.’s academic performance was satisfactory.\n\n    After Dr. Burke updated her assessments, a second IEP\nteam meeting was held on October 9, 2012, to reconsider\nL.J.’s eligibility for special education services under the\ncategory of emotional disturbance.           See 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.8(c)(4). The requested third grade teacher was not\npresent at the meeting and L.J. had not been assessed by a\nnurse, in violation of both conditions insisted upon by L.J.’s\nmother in the agreement. The team again concluded that L.J.\nwas not eligible for special education, the same conclusion\nreached at the first meeting the preceding May, despite\nrepeated intervening hospitalizations, heavy medications,\nrenewed suicide attempts, and individualized\naccommodations in school.\n\n    On October 15, 2012, L.J. filed an amended complaint\nwith the California OAH. L.J.’s mother again submitted\nformal requests for L.J.’s school records in October and\nNovember 2012, and in March 2013. The mental health\nrecords kept by the School District, including Lincoln, were\nnever disclosed.\n\n    During that fourth grade year, L.J. was sent to the office\nmultiple times for physically injuring classmates, disrupting\nclass, and refusing to follow directives. School staff\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   11\n\ncontacted L.J.’s mother to pick him up from school early on\nnumerous occasions. The School District conducted another\nmental health assessment. He was again diagnosed with\nADHD. In this assessment, the clinician concluded his\nADHD symptoms caused clinically significant impairment in\nL.J.’s social and academic functioning, that L.J. relied\nextensively on medications, and further, that he evidenced\nfunctional impairments in the areas of family relations, school\nperformance, and peer relations.\n\n    The following year, in the fall of 2013, the School District\nnevertheless placed L.J. in a regular fifth grade classroom\nwithout accommodations or services. In November, L.J. was\nrushed to the emergency room by ambulance after attempting\nto hang himself with a lanyard. That year, L.J. physically\ninjured children and at least one teacher. L.J. was suspended\nfor “kicking and hitting” his science teacher, calling another\nteacher “stupid,” and brandishing a fake knife in the\nclassroom. L.J. was also suspended again because he\nendangered a classmate by putting expandable pellets in the\nclassmate’s water bottle without his knowledge.\n\n    That spring, L.J.’s due process request made its way\nbefore an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”). The ALJ\nconducted a three-day hearing in April, and on May 23, 2013,\nthe ALJ issued her decision, denying all of L.J.’s requests for\nrelief. The ALJ found that L.J. had no disabilities that would\nqualify him for special education services, and even if he had\nqualifying disabilities, he had not demonstrated a need for\nspecial services because his academic performance was\nsatisfactory when he was able to attend school.\n\f12                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\n            PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n    L.J. timely appealed the ALJ’s ruling to the district court.\nL.J. contended that he was eligible for special education\nservices and asked the district court to order the School\nDistrict to provide an IEP. The parties filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment. The district court disagreed with the\nALJ’s decision that L.J. had no disabling conditions. The\ndistrict court ruled that L.J. met the qualifying criteria as a\nstudent with three disabilities: specific learning disability,\nother health impairment (due to his ADHD), and serious\nemotional disturbance (due to his ODD and bipolar disorder).\n\n    The district court, nevertheless, granted the School\nDistrict’s motion for summary judgment, ruling that L.J. did\nnot need special education services because of his satisfactory\nperformance in general education. The district court adopted\nthe ALJ’s findings that L.J. was performing well\nbehaviorally, socially, and academically between May and\nOctober 2012 with the help of services the court characterized\nas general education accommodations, not individualized\nspecial education services.\n\n     This appeal followed.\n\n                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n    The district court’s findings of fact are reviewed for clear\nerror, even when the district court based those findings on an\nadministrative record, and conclusions of law are reviewed de\nnovo.

Statutory Background and Legal Framework\n\n    Under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400–1491, all states that\nreceive federal education funding must establish policies and\nprocedures to ensure that a “free appropriate public education\nis available to all children with disabilities.” Id. at\n§ 1412(a)(1)(A). The IDEA defines a FAPE as “special\neducation” that is provided at public expense. Id. at\n§ 1401(9). A child receives a FAPE, for purposes of the\nIDEA, if the program addresses the child’s unique needs,\nprovides adequate support services so that the child can take\nadvantage of educational opportunities, and is in accord with\nthe IEP. Id. A state must comply both procedurally and\nsubstantively with the IDEA. Id. at § 1400 et seq.\n\n    In determining whether a student has received a FAPE in\ncompliance with the IDEA, the court conducts both a\nprocedural and substantive inquiry. The court considers\nwhether the school complied with the procedures set forth in\nthe IDEA. Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206–07\n(1982). The court also evaluates whether the IEP in this case,\nor lack thereof, was reasonably calculated to enable the child\nto receive educational benefits. Id. Where a court identifies\na procedural violation that denied a student a FAPE, the court\nneed not address the second substantive prong of the inquiry.\nDoug C. v. Haw.

V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\n    Not all procedural violations constitute a denial of a\nFAPE. R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1453516\"><a href=\"/opinion/1453516/rb-ex-rel-fb-v-napa-valley-unified-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n938 (9th Cir. 2007). A child is denied a FAPE when\nprocedural inadequacies result in the loss of an educational\nopportunity, or seriously infringe on the parents’ opportunity\nto participate in the IEP formulation process. Doug C.,\n720 F.3d at 1043. A procedural error is harmless if the\nstudent is substantively ineligible for IDEA benefits. R.B.,\n496 F.3d at 942.\n\nII. Eligibility for IDEA Benefits\n\n    The initial issue in this case is whether L.J. was\nsubstantively eligible for IDEA benefits, since the ALJ held\nhe was not. A child is substantively eligible for special\neducation and related services if he is a “child with a\ndisability,” which is statutorily defined, in relevant part, as a\nchild with a serious emotional disturbance, other health\nimpairment, or specific learning disability and who, by reason\nthereof, needs special education and related services.\n20 U.S.C. § 1401(3)(A). California Education Code similarly\nprovides that a “student with exceptional needs” who is\neligible under § 1401(3)(A) must have an impairment that\n“requires instruction and services which cannot be provided\nwith modification of the regular school program.” Cal. Educ.\nCode §§ 56026(a), (b).\n\n    Even if a child has such a disability, he or she does not\nqualify for special education services if support provided\nthrough the regular school program is sufficient. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1401(3)(A); Cal. Educ. Code § 56026. “[S]pecial classes,\nseparate schooling, or other removal of children with\ndisabilities from the regular educational environment occurs\nonly when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   15\n\nsuch that education in regular classes with the use of\nsupplementary aids and services cannot be achieved\nsatisfactorily.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A).\n\n    The parties on appeal no longer dispute that L.J. should\nhave been categorized as a child with a disability under three\ncategories set forth in the statute. First, L.J. has a “specific\nlearning disability” because he has exhibited a severe\ndiscrepancy between his intellectual ability and his\nachievement. 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(10). Second, L.J. has an\n“other health impairment” because his ADHD and mood\ndisorders interfere with his ability to progress academically\nand socially. 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(9). Lastly, L.J.’s mood\ndisorders constitute a “serious emotional disturbance.” 34\nC.F.R. § 300.8(c)(4).\n\n    The critical issue in this appeal therefore is whether L.J.\ndemonstrated a need for special education services. This case\ndiffers from most IDEA cases in that L.J. never received an\nIEP because the School District continually maintained he\nhad no qualifying disabilities. The ALJ agreed that he had no\nqualifying disabilities. The district court held that the ALJ\nwas incorrect in this regard and that L.J. had qualifying\ndisabilities. The district court went on to conclude, however,\nthat L.J. was performing satisfactorily without the need for\nspecial education services. We must therefore determine\nwhether general education was appropriate or whether L.J.\nexhibited a need for special education services.\n\n    The appropriateness of a student’s eligibility should be\nassessed in terms of its appropriateness at the time of the\nchild’s evaluation and not from the perspective of a later time\nwith the benefit of hindsight. Adams v. Oregon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766693\"><a href=\"/opinion/766693/lucas-adams-by-and-through-his-parents-dave-adams-lisandra-adams-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1149 (9th Cir. 1999). When making this assessment of\n\f16                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nwhether an eligibility determination is “appropriate” under\nthe IDEA, this court looks to the time of the child’s\nevaluation by the School District. We employ what is termed\nthe “snapshot” rule that instructs the court to judge the\nappropriateness of the determination on the basis of the\ninformation reasonably available to the parties at the time of\nthe IEP meeting. Id. “An IEP must take into account what\nwas and was not, objectively reasonable when the snapshot\nwas taken.” Id. (citation omitted). We judge the eligibility\ndecision on the basis of whether it took the relevant\ninformation into account, not on whether or not it worked. Id.\n\n     In this case, it is undisputed that the snapshot period was\nthe period surrounding the two IEP meetings: on May 30,\n2012, in the third grade, and October 9, 2012, in the fourth\ngrade. That was the critical period on which the School\nDistrict based its eligibility decisions, and the district court\ncorrectly focused on L.J.’s eligibility for special education by\nlooking to his behavior, academic progress, and social needs\nat that time. The district court was correct when it found that\nL.J. should have been categorized as a child with a disability\nwithin the meaning of the IDEA. L.J. had multiple\ndisabilities, which manifested serious behavioral problems.\n\n    The district court nonetheless concluded that L.J. was not\neligible for special education because he was academically\nperforming satisfactorily without receiving special education\nservices and on the basis of the general education curriculum.\nThis was clear error because L.J. was receiving special\nservices, including mental health counseling and assistance\nfrom a one-on-one paraeducator. These are not services\noffered to general education students.\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                  17\n\n    This distinction is important. General education is what\nis provided to non-disabled children in the classroom.\nSpecial education, on the other hand, is “specially designed\ninstruction” to meet the unique needs of a child with a\ndisability. 34 C.F.R. § 300.39(a)(1). “Specially designed\ninstruction” is defined under the IDEA regulations:\n\n       Specially designed instruction means\n       adapting, as appropriate to the needs of an\n       eligible child under this part, the content,\n       methodology, or delivery of instruction—\n\n           (i) To address the unique needs of the\n       child that result from the child’s disability;\n       and\n\n            (ii) To ensure access of the child to the\n       general curriculum, so that the child can meet\n       the educational standards within the\n       jurisdiction of the public agency that apply to\n       all children.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.39(b)(3) (emphasis added).\n\n    The district court decided that L.J. did not need an IEP\nbecause, despite his multiple disabilities, L.J. was performing\nsatisfactorily in general education. The problem with the\ndistrict court’s analysis is that many of the services the\ndistrict court viewed as general education services were in\nfact special education services tailored to L.J.’s situation.\nThe district court thus classified many of the services L.J.\nreceived as general education, when they were not.\nDiscussion of a few examples will make the point.\n\f18                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\n    First, general education instruction does not provide for\none-on-one direction. L.J. received special assistance in the\nthird grade from a one-on-one paraeducator, pursuant to the\nparties agreement that year. The School District claims that\nthe paraeducator “faded back considerably” by May 30, the\ndate of the initial IEP meeting, but this is not accurate. The\nparaeducator continued to assist L.J. throughout the third\ngrade.\n\n    Second, general education instruction does not provide for\nspecially designed mental health services. The School\nDistrict’s position is that L.J. received only general education\nmental health services from Lincoln that the School District\nmakes available to all students. The School District\ndistinguishes such services from services received by special\neducation students, which are specially designed mental\nhealth services.\n\n    The flaw in the School District’s argument is that the\nmental health services that L.J. received from second grade\nthrough fourth grade were specially-designed for him. Such\nservices included services that the School District described\nas follows: Assessments, Plan Development, Group and\nIndividual Rehabilitation, Group and Individual Therapy,\nFamily Therapy, and Collateral Family Group and Intensive\nHome-Based Services. The School District acknowledges\nthat only students requiring special education receive an\neducationally-related mental health assessment. L.J. received\ntwo such mental health assessments. L.J. was referred to\nLincoln by the School District’s Director of Special\nEducation and Psychological Services, and the School\nDistrict acknowledged this means of referral is for special\neducation students only.\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                   19\n\n    Third, general education instruction does not typically\ninclude extensive clinical interventions by a School District\nbehavior specialist. While it is not unusual for a behavior\nspecialist to offer support to a general education teacher, here\nthe School District’s behavior specialist did much more.\nThroughout the third grade year, he designed specific BSPs\nin an attempt to meet L.J.’s needs. The plans included\nadapting the method and delivery of L.J.’s instruction, and\nstrategies to promote a structured environment and reinforce\npositive behavior. The behavior specialist also designed a\nnine-hour training session for L.J.’s paraeducator. After\ntraining L.J.’s aide, the behavior specialist closely supervised\nhim to ensure the interventions followed the new BSP.\n\n    The district court clearly erred by mischaracterizing all of\nthese individualized services as general education available\nto all students, rather than as special education provided to\nstudents with disabilities. The court went on to conclude,\nerroneously, that L.J. did not require specialized assistance in\nthe future on the ground that he was no longer exhibiting\nbehaviors that interfered with his school performance.\nGranted, his condition had improved during the snapshot\nperiod, for by the time of the IEP meetings, L.J.’s\nimpairments had been eased with the accommodations and\nservices provided by the School District. With the assistance\nof medication and specially designed instruction, L.J. had\nperiods of temporary behavioral and academic gain. L.J.’s\nteachers, service providers, and mother all reported that L.J.\nhad made good progress in academics and improved his\nsocial skills with his classmates during the snapshot period.\n\n    Dr. Burke opined that his average or above-average\nacademic testing scores showed academic achievement had\nnot been impacted by any of his issues. Standardized tests\n\f20               L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nranked L.J.’s academic performance in an overall average\nrange. Although there was progress, it was no doubt in a\nsetting where multiple services were being provided and the\nprogress must at least, in substantial part, be attributed to\nthose services. Moreover, L.J. has shown himself to be an\nintelligent child, so his academic performance could have\nbeen even more improved with the appropriate specially\ndesigned instruction.\n\n   Yet, L.J. continued to have troubling behavioral and\nacademic issues during the snapshot period. The district\ncourt did not adequately take these into account when it\ndecided there was no need for future specialized services.\nThe information available to the IEP team during the\nsnapshot period was dramatic.\n\n    L.J. threatened and attempted to kill himself on numerous\noccasions. On May 29, 2012, the day before his initial IEP\nmeeting, L.J. attempted to kill himself by sticking his finger\nin a light socket and putting items down his throat. On May\n30, 2012, the day of his first eligibility determination, L.J.\ncould not have been doing well socially, behaviorally, or\nacademically at school because he was in extended care at a\npsychiatric hospital. He was confined to the hospital for over\na week and missed at least six school days. L.J. was again\nadmitted for psychiatric hospitalization on July 17 and July\n26, 2012. L.J. was detained as a danger to himself or others\nbecause he was banging his head against walls and making\nthreats of harm.\n\n    The district court concluded that L.J.’s psychiatric\nhospitalizations and suicide attempts were not relevant to his\neligibility for specialized instruction because they occurred\noutside the school environment. Yet, the issue is whether his\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                  21\n\ndisabilities interfered with his education and necessitated\nspecial services. It is hard to imagine how an emotional\ndisturbance so severe that it resulted in repeated suicide\nattempts would not interfere with school performance. That\nhe attempted suicide outside the school environment is\nimmaterial. His emotional disturbance adversely affected his\nattendance and his teachers all reported that L.J.’s classroom\nabsences, due to psychiatric hospitalizations, hurt his\nacademic performance. To distinguish between where a\nstudent attempted suicide—between home and\nschool—misses the point. The point being that whether\nhaving a suicidal ideation and attempting suicide interfered\nwith L.J.’s education.\n\n    In fourth grade, in September, L.J. was suspended for two\ndays after throwing rocks at and threatening to kill the school\nprincipal. The district court did not think his suspension was\nof great import, noting that it was only for two days. But this\nwas not L.J.’s only incident. Shortly before the October 9,\n2012, IEP meeting, L.J. was unable to ride the school bus\nbecause he refused to follow the bus driver’s directions.\n\n    L.J. also continually had needs associated with his\nmedication and treatment for his mood disorders and ADHD.\nBy fourth grade, L.J. relied on psychotropic medications in\norder to attend school. His fourth grade teacher reported that\nL.J.’s functioning declined in the absence of medication or\nwhen it had no mitigating effects. School counselors\nrepeatedly expressed their concern regarding L.J.’s\nmedication management. The district court neglected to\ndiscuss L.J.’s ongoing needs associated with his medication.\n\n   L.J. clearly exhibited behavioral and academic difficulty\nduring the snapshot period. He threatened and attempted to\n\f22                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nkill himself on three occasions in 2012. In the fall, he\nfrequently acted out at school, and continued to have needs\nassociated with his medication regimen. The district court\nshould not have discounted these facts. They demonstrate\nthat L.J. required special education services.\n\n   Because L.J. is eligible for special education, the School\nDistrict must formulate an IEP. We reverse the district\ncourt’s decision and remand for it to order that the School\nDistrict provide that remedy.\n\nIII.   Procedural Violations of the IDEA\n\n    Procedural safeguards are built into the IDEA to ensure\nthat a child’s education is fair and appropriate and the parents\nhave an opportunity to participate in the IEP formulation\nprocess. Doug C., 720 F.3d at 1043. The record in this case\nreflects some serious violations of these safeguards by the\nSchool District.\n\n    The School District failed to disclose assessments,\ntreatment plans, and progress notes from L.J.’s time at\nLincoln. The district court erred in concluding that this\nfailure did not interfere with L.J.’s mother’s opportunity to\nparticipate in the IEP formulation process.\n\n    Under the IDEA, parents have the right to informed\nconsent. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(1)(D). Consent means that the\nparent has been fully informed of all information relevant to\nthe activity for which consent is sought. 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.9(a). To guarantee parents the ability to make informed\ndecisions about their child’s education, the IDEA gives them\nthe right to examine all pertinent education records relating\nto their child. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1). The Lincoln records\n\f                   L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                    23\n\nconstitute such education records and should have been\ndisclosed to L.J.’s mother.\n\n    Parents also have the right to invite to attend IEP\nmeetings individuals with knowledge or special expertise\nregarding their child. 34 C.F.R. § 300.321(a)(6). L.J.’s\nmother had the right to have L.J.’s mental health providers at\nboth the May and October IEP meetings. Id. Without\nknowledge of the Lincoln records, however, L.J.’s mother\nwaived the attendance of his mental health clinicians at the\nIEP meetings. At the very least, L.J.’s parent should have\nreceived complete copies of the Lincoln records so that she\ncould provide informed consent regarding the exclusion of his\nmental health providers from the IEP team. Had L.J.’s\nmother been aware of the content of the Lincoln records, she\nmay well not have waived the mental health providers’\nattendance.\n\n    The School District also failed to conduct a health\nassessment for the purpose of determining how L.J.’s health,\nand particularly his medications, affected his performance.\nThe district court held that this error did not infringe on L.J.’s\nmother’s ability to participate in the IEP process because\nL.J.’s medications were not administered at school. We fail\nto see that the need for a health assessment should depend on\nwhere medications are administered, and we are cited to\nnothing in support of the proposition.\n\n    Under the IDEA, the School District must conduct a “full\nand initial evaluation,” one which ensures the child is\nassessed in “all areas of suspected disability.” 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1414(a)(1)(A), (b)(3)(B). This requirement allows the\nchild’s IEP team to have a complete picture of the child’s\nfunctional, developmental, and academic needs. When a\n\f24                L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.\n\nstudent has been diagnosed as having a chronic illness, as L.J.\nwas, the student may be referred to the School District for a\nhealth assessment. 5 Cal. Code Reg. § 3021.1. A health\nassessment focuses on diagnoses, health history, and those\nspecific health needs while in school which are necessary to\nassist a child with a disability. The regulations then require\nthat the IEP team review, among other things, the “possible\nmedical side effects and complications of treatment that could\naffect school functioning.” Id. The district court erred when\nit dismissed the School District’s failure to conduct a health\nassessment, depriving L.J. of an educational benefit. See\nDoug C., 720 F.3d at 1043 (a FAPE is denied where\nprocedural inadequacies result in loss of educational\nbenefits).\n\n    Here, there is reason to believe that alternative services\nwould have at least been more seriously considered during\nthe IEP process if the School District had assessed L.J.’s\nhealth, including the effects of his medication on his health.\nThe record evidence showed that L.J. continually had needs\nassociated with his medication and treatment, which\nadversely impacted his academic, behavioral, and social\nperformance. Because his health and the impacts of his\nmedication were never assessed, no matter what assistance\nL.J. received, the School District would remain unable to\nappropriately address those needs.\n\n    In sum, the School District clearly violated important\nprocedural safeguards set forth in the IDEA. The School\nDistrict failed to disclose assessments, treatment plans, and\nprogress notes kept by Lincoln, which deprived L.J.’s mother\nof her right to informed consent. The School District also\nfailed to conduct a health assessment, which rendered the\n\f                  L.J. V. PITTSBURG U.S.D.                  25\n\nSchool District and IEP team unable to evaluate and address\nL.J.’s medication and treatment related needs.\n\n     When this matter returns to the School District for the\npreparation of an IEP, the School District must comply with\nthe IDEA’s procedural safeguards. Additional procedural\nviolations can only result in the further protraction of\nproceedings and costly financial and emotional burdens for\nall those involved.\n\n                      CONCLUSION\n\n    L.J. is a child with disabilities within the meaning of the\nIDEA and needs special education. The judgment of the\ndistrict court is reversed and the matter remanded to the\ndistrict court with instruction to order the School District to\nprovide an appropriate remedy.\n\n   Costs are awarded to Plaintiffs-Appellants.\n\n   REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f</pre>",
