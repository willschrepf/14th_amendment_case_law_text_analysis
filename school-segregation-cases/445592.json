JOHNSON, Jr. and POLITZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FRANK M. JOHNSON, Jr., Circuit Judge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas requiring the sheriff and the members of the commissioners court of El Paso County, Texas, to limit the inmate population of the El Paso County jail and to submit weekly reports of conditions at the jail to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not the first time that this controversy has been before this Court.  The case began on July 3, 1974, when an inmate of the jail, acting on his own behalf and as a representative of all other El Paso County jail inmates, filed suit for injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 alleging that conditions at the jail violated the United States Constitution and Texas statutory law.  On September 25, 1975, after a nonjury trial, the district court found these allegations to be true.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-3\" id=\"fn1-3_ref\">1</a>  It issued an order requiring the sheriff and the commissioners court to initiate certain remedial programs by January 20, 1976,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-3\" id=\"fn2-3_ref\">2</a> to bring the jail into compliance with Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5115 by September 1, 1977,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-3\" id=\"fn3-3_ref\">3</a> and to provide an outdoor area for exercise and a rehabilitative program of recreation by September 1, 1977.  With certain modifications irrelevant here, the district court order was affirmed on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a>  On June 15, 1977, on remand, the district court ordered the defendants to submit reports on their present compliance and their plans for future compliance with the court's order as modified on appeal.  After receiving these reports and denying a request for a hearing, the district court, on October 19, 1977, issued the order that is the subject of this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-2\" id=\"fn5-2_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants claim that this order is invalid in four respects.  First, they contend that the nature of the relief that the order requires cannot legally be provided by the defendants under state law.  They argue that compliance with the order's limitation on inmate population would require the sheriff to violate his statutory duty to accept prisoners<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-2\" id=\"fn6-2_ref\">6</a> and the commissioners court to violate its duty to stay within spending limits imposed by state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-2\" id=\"fn7-2_ref\">7</a>  This claim has no merit.  It is well established that inadequate funding will not excuse the perpetuation of unconstitutional conditions of confinement, E. g., Williams v. Edwards, 547 F.2d 1206, 1212-13 (5th Cir. 1977); Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291, 1319-20 (5th Cir. 1974); Mickens v. Winston, 462 F.Supp. 910, 912 (E.D.Va.1978); Inmates of Boys' Training School v. Southworth, 76 F.R.D. 115, 119 (D.R.I.1977); nor will an allegedly contrary duty at state law, Costello v. Wainwright, 525 F.2d 1239, 1243 (5th Cir.), Vacated and replaced, 539 F.2d 547 (5th Cir. 1976) (en banc), Replacement rev'd and remanded, 430 U.S. 325, 97 S.Ct. 1191, 51 L.Ed.2d 372 (1977), Original opinion reinstated, 553 F.2d 506 (5th Cir. 1977) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' second and third claims also fail.  Their assertion that the portion of the district court order requiring the submission of weekly reports violates principles of federalism is frivolous, as is their contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction to order the defendants to continue to accept federal prisoners in the manner prescribed by state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-2\" id=\"fn8-2_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants are correct, however, in arguing that the trial court erred in failing to conduct further hearings as to the overall conditions at the jail before ordering that the inmate population be limited to 500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It need not be repeated that federal courts should intervene in the day-to-day operation of state and local penal and detention systems only with the greatest of reluctance.  Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 404-05, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); Williams v. Edwards, 547 F.2d at 1211-12; Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318, 328 (M.D.Ala.1976), Aff'd in part sub nom.  Newman v. Alabama, 559 F.2d 283 (5th Cir. 1977), Modified sub nom.  Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978); Diamond v. Thompson, 364 F.Supp. 659, 662 (M.D.Ala.1973), Aff'd, 523 F.2d 1201 (5th Cir. 1975).  Where constitutional deprivations are established, either in specific instances, E. g., Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969) (regulation infringing inmates' right of access to the courts), or by the totality of conditions within an institution, E. g., Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d at 1309 (\"(e)ach factor separately . . .  may not rise to constitutional dimensions; however, the effect of the totality of these circumstances is the infliction of punishment on inmates violative of the Eighth Amendment\"), the federal courts may, and must, if the issue is appropriately presented, intervene.  E. g., Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 685-88, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978); Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. at 405-06, 94 S.Ct. 1800.  See also Newman v. Alabama, supra; Pugh v. Locke, supra.  As indicated above, the federal courts have the power, and the duty, to make their intervention effective.  To prevent further constitutional deprivations, a court may order forms of relief not normally required by the Constitution but nevertheless necessary given the circumstances if the court's efforts are to be successful.  See, e. g., Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. at 685-88, 98 S.Ct. 2565 (affirming order forbidding more than 30 days of punitive isolation); Miller v. Carson, 563 F.2d 741, 751 (5th Cir. 1977) (affirming order requiring outdoor exercise).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a>  Where, however, no constitutional deprivation is established, the justification for federal judicial intervention evaporates.  Although state standards may sometimes serve as a useful guide in a federal court's determination and redress of constitutional deprivations, See, e. g., Williams v. Edwards, 547 F.2d at 1214 (state fire and sanitation codes indicate 'evolving notions of decency'; use of such codes allows federal district judge to minimize intrusion into details of state prison administration), Adams v. Mathis, 458 F.Supp. 302, 309 (M.D.Ala.1978), a violation of state law, without more, will not justify federal judicial intervention.  Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. at 688, 98 S.Ct. 2565 &amp; n.12; Diamond v. Thompson, 364 F.Supp. at 662.  Cf. Taylor v. Sterrett, 600 F.2d 1135 (5th Cir. 1979) (requiring district court that had intervened on basis of state law violation to discontinue exercise of its jurisdiction and dismiss the cause).  Unless acting to remedy federal constitutional violations as part of a \"totality\" approach, federal judges are not to become enmeshed in the minutiae of prison operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the record before us, we find it impossible to determine whether the district court's 500-inmate limitation on the jail population was tailored to remedy a constitutional violation.  Although unconstitutional overcrowding was alleged in the original complaint, the district court never responded to the allegation with recorded findings of fact or conclusions of law.  What the record indicates is that the court ordered the 500-inmate limit merely to bring the jail closer to compliance with state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  As stated above, the imposition of such an order by a federal court is inappropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  A limitation on the inmate population of the El Paso County jail may be necessary, but the district court should impose such a limitation only if the court finds on remand, after a hearing and evaluation of evidence relating to The totality of conditions at the jail as they now exist, that the jail is overcrowded and that, considered with all of the other existing conditions, incarceration therein is violative of the prisoners' constitutional rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although unchallenged by the defendants here, there are other aspects of the district court's operative orders in this case that may, for the reasons set out above, constitute unwarranted federal judicial intervention in the day-to-day operation of the El Paso County jail.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (setting out test for determining constitutionality of conditions of confinement in facilities housing pretrial detainees).  The district court is instructed on remand to review its orders in light of Wolfish and the totality of the conditions at the jail as they now exist.  The court should continue to exercise its jurisdiction only if and to the extent that it determines that there are continuing deprivations of federal constitutional dimensions.  See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. at 688, 98 S.Ct. 2565 &amp; n.12; Taylor v. Sterrett, 600 F.2d at 1145-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, the portion of the district court order limiting the inmate population at the El Paso County jail is vacated.  The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX # 1</p>\n    <p>FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n    <p>1.

In addition to finding that the order presented little danger of interference with prison administration, and that it was issued by a trial judge who had had long experience with the litigation, the majority noted that \"(t)he order is supported by the interdependence of the conditions producing the violation.\"  It stated that \"(t)he 30-day limit will help to correct these conditions.\"  Id. at 688, 98 S.Ct. at 2572 (footnote omitted).  Cf. id. at 714, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2572 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (accusing the majority of allowing the district court to assume a management role in the Arkansas prison system)</p>\n        <p>In Miller, the court stated that \"(w)hen the totality of conditions in a penal institution violates the Constitution, the trial court's remedies are not limited to the redress of specific constitutional rights.\"  563 F.2d at 751.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5115 requires, among other things, See Appendix # 2, that not less than thirty percent of a jail's total designated capacity be accommodated in single-prisoner cells.  The El Paso County jail, which had an alleged designated capacity of 588 inmates but only 14 single cells, clearly failed to meet this requirement.  It was apparently to bring the jail closer to compliance with Article 5115 that the district court ordered the 500-inmate limit.  As the court remarked during a March 9, 1978, contempt proceeding:</p>\n        <p>I think if we accept that the (defendants) will do nothing concerning the enlargement of the jail or the restructuring of the jail, that you will, in fact, continue to face a problem concerning how many people you can handle, Mr. Rodriguez.</p>\n        <p>That was the reason for the Court's originally reducing the amount of 500 because you were so utterly and completely out of compliance with both the spirit and the fact of 5115 that there is no possible way exceeding 500 that you can begin to comply with the proper segregation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> It would seem especially inappropriate where the state has indicated And demonstrated a willingness to police itself.  In Taylor v. Sterrett, 600 F.2d 1135, 1141-45 (5th Cir. 1979), we noted that in 1975 the state of Texas created a Commission on Jail Standards charged with supervising day-to-day administration and long-term planning in Texas county jails.  We also noted that the Commission is authorized to close nonconforming facilities.  Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5115.1.  We concluded that the establishment of the Commission indicated a strong state commitment to improve conditions in Texas county jails.  600 F.2d at 1145-46 (conclusion held to warrant return of Dallas County jails to state and local jurisdiction).  The record in this case does not suggest that that conclusion was mistaken.  As the district judge stated in a conference of counsel held approximately a week after the issuance of the order: \"If I had a sneaking suspicion or some firm evidence that they (the Commission on Jail Standards) weren't going to perform, then I would have no hesitance to find that a sham and a pretense and but I don't think that.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> If the district court makes such a determination and documents the conclusion with appropriate findings, the court should take care to establish a sufficient evidentiary basis for any inmate population limit that it decides to order as a result.  In addition, it should reevaluate its assessment of the importance of holding the defendants to their State statutory obligation to continue to accept federal prisoners.

The case began on July 3, 1974, when an inmate of the jail, acting on his own behalf and as a representative of all other El Paso County jail inmates, filed suit for injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 alleging that conditions at the jail violated the United States Constitution and Texas statutory law.  On September 25, 1975, after a nonjury trial, the district court found these allegations to be true.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-3\" id=\"fn1-3_ref\">1</a>  It issued an order requiring the sheriff and the commissioners court to initiate certain remedial programs by January 20, 1976,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-3\" id=\"fn2-3_ref\">2</a> to bring the jail into compliance with Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5115 by September 1, 1977,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-3\" id=\"fn3-3_ref\">3</a> and to provide an outdoor area for exercise and a rehabilitative program of recreation by September 1, 1977.  With certain modifications irrelevant here, the district court order was affirmed on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a>  On June 15, 1977, on remand, the district court ordered the defendants to submit reports on their present compliance and their plans for future compliance with the court's order as modified on appeal.  After receiving these reports and denying a request for a hearing, the district court, on October 19, 1977, issued the order that is the subject of this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-2\" id=\"fn5-2_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants claim that this order is invalid in four respects.  First, they contend that the nature of the relief that the order requires cannot legally be provided by the defendants under state law.  They argue that compliance with the order's limitation on inmate population would require the sheriff to violate his statutory duty to accept prisoners<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-2\" id=\"fn6-2_ref\">6</a> and the commissioners court to violate its duty to stay within spending limits imposed by state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-2\" id=\"fn7-2_ref\">7</a>  This claim has no merit.  It is well established that inadequate funding will not excuse the perpetuation of unconstitutional conditions of confinement, E. g., Williams v.

Their assertion that the portion of the district court order requiring the submission of weekly reports violates principles of federalism is frivolous, as is their contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction to order the defendants to continue to accept federal prisoners in the manner prescribed by state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-2\" id=\"fn8-2_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants are correct, however, in arguing that the trial court erred in failing to conduct further hearings as to the overall conditions at the jail before ordering that the inmate population be limited to 500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It need not be repeated that federal courts should intervene in the day-to-day operation of state and local penal and detention systems only with the greatest of reluctance.

As indicated above, the federal courts have the power, and the duty, to make their intervention effective.  To prevent further constitutional deprivations, a court may order forms of relief not normally required by the Constitution but nevertheless necessary given the circumstances if the court's efforts are to be successful.

Edwards, 547 F.2d at 1214 (state fire and sanitation codes indicate 'evolving notions of decency'; use of such codes allows federal district judge to minimize intrusion into details of state prison administration), Adams v.

Although unconstitutional overcrowding was alleged in the original complaint, the district court never responded to the allegation with recorded findings of fact or conclusions of law.  What the record indicates is that the court ordered the 500-inmate limit merely to bring the jail closer to compliance with state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  As stated above, the imposition of such an order by a federal court is inappropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  A limitation on the inmate population of the El Paso County jail may be necessary, but the district court should impose such a limitation only if the court finds on remand, after a hearing and evaluation of evidence relating to The totality of conditions at the jail as they now exist, that the jail is overcrowded and that, considered with all of the other existing conditions, incarceration therein is violative of the prisoners' constitutional rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although unchallenged by the defendants here, there are other aspects of the district court's operative orders in this case that may, for the reasons set out above, constitute unwarranted federal judicial intervention in the day-to-day operation of the El Paso County jail.

The district court's January 6, 1978, modification of the order so as to require only that the defendants submit the reports on best information and belief effectively moots this argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">8</a>\n        <p> The district court in its order stated that nothing in the order was to diminish the responsibility of the defendants to comply with the requirement of Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5117 that \"(s)heriffs and jailers shall receive into their jails such prisoners as may be delivered or tendered to them by any United States Marshal or his deputy for any district of Texas . . . .\"  In addition, the court required the defendants to obtain prior approval from the court of any contested increase in the fee charged by the county for this service</p>\n        <p>The defendants' argument is that, even assuming the validity of the rest of the court's order, this portion is invalid because at the time it was entered the United States was not a party to the litigation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">9</a>\n        <p> In Hutto v.

In addition to finding that the order presented little danger of interference with prison administration, and that it was issued by a trial judge who had had long experience with the litigation, the majority noted that \"(t)he order is supported by the interdependence of the conditions producing the violation.\"  It stated that \"(t)he 30-day limit will help to correct these conditions.\"  Id. at 688, 98 S.Ct. at 2572 (footnote omitted).

The El Paso County jail, which had an alleged designated capacity of 588 inmates but only 14 single cells, clearly failed to meet this requirement.  It was apparently to bring the jail closer to compliance with Article 5115 that the district court ordered the 500-inmate limit.  As the court remarked during a March 9, 1978, contempt proceeding:</p>\n        <p>I think if we accept that the (defendants) will do nothing concerning the enlargement of the jail or the restructuring of the jail, that you will, in fact, continue to face a problem concerning how many people you can handle, Mr. Rodriguez.</p>\n        <p>That was the reason for the Court's originally reducing the amount of 500 because you were so utterly and completely out of compliance with both the spirit and the fact of 5115 that there is no possible way exceeding 500 that you can begin to comply with the proper segregation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> It would seem especially inappropriate where the state has indicated And demonstrated a willingness to police itself.  In Taylor v. Sterrett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"367187\"><a href=\"/opinion/367187/joseph-taylor-v-w-l-sterrett-judge-john-whittington/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>, 1141-45 (5th Cir. 1979), we noted that in 1975 the state of Texas created a Commission on Jail Standards charged with supervising day-to-day administration and long-term planning in Texas county jails.  We also noted that the Commission is authorized to close nonconforming facilities.  Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5115.1.  We concluded that the establishment of the Commission indicated a strong state commitment to improve conditions in Texas county jails.  600 F.2d at 1145-46 (conclusion held to warrant return of Dallas County jails to state and local jurisdiction).  The record in this case does not suggest that that conclusion was mistaken.  As the district judge stated in a conference of counsel held approximately a week after the issuance of the order: \"If I had a sneaking suspicion or some firm evidence that they (the Commission on Jail Standards) weren't going to perform, then I would have no hesitance to find that a sham and a pretense and but I don't think that.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> If the district court makes such a determination and documents the conclusion with appropriate findings, the court should take care to establish a sufficient evidentiary basis for any inmate population limit that it decides to order as a result.  In addition, it should reevaluate its assessment of the importance of holding the defendants to their State statutory obligation to continue to accept federal prisoners.
