(“Mickey”) Redus move this Court to\n\ndismiss this interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction. Tex. R. Civ. P. 42.3(a).\n\nDefendant and appellant University of the Incarnate Word (“UIW”) filed this\n\ninterlocutory appeal after the trial court signed an order denying UIW’s Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction. This Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because UIW is not a\n\n“governmental unit” as defined in Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.001(3).\n\nInterlocutory orders are not appealable unless expressly authorized by statute, and\n\nUIW, as a private, non-profit institution of higher education, lacks a statutory basis\n\nfor invoking this Court’s appellate jurisdiction.\n\f                               INTRODUCTION\n\n      Appellees Valerie and Mickey Redus are the parents of Robert Cameron\n\nRedus. Trial court defendant Christopher Carter shot Cameron Redus five times,\n\nkilling him in the parking lot at Cameron’s off-campus apartment in Alamo Heights\n\non December 6, 2013. Appellant UIW employed Carter as an on-duty Campus\n\nPolice Officer when he shot Cameron.\n\n      Valerie and Mickey Redus sued UIW and Carter on May 6, 2014 for claims\n\narising from Cameron’s death. C.R. 1. UIW filed its Original Answer on June 2,\n\n2014 and removed the case to federal court. C.R. 22. UIW did not originally raise\n\na Texas Tort Claims Act affirmative defense but did claim immunity as a\n\n“charitable institution.” C.R. 34. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem Code § 84.003. The\n\nfederal court remanded this action to state court on November 25, 2014. C.R. 381.\n\n      UIW filed its First Amended Answer on February 13, 2015, adding the Texas\n\nTort Claims Act as an affirmative defense. C.R. 109. UIW also filed its Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction, claiming that plaintiffs’ claims are limited by the Texas Tort Claims\n\nAct because UIW—or at least its police department—is a “governmental unit.” C.R.\n\n125. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.001(3).\n\n      The trial court heard UIW’s plea to the jurisdiction on February 26, 2015 and\n\nsigned an order denying it on March 2, 2015. C.R. 418. UIW initiated this\n\ninterlocutory appeal of the denial on March 3, citing Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n\n51.014(a)(8) as this Court’s jurisdictional basis. C.R. 419. The trial court has not\n\nmade findings of fact despite appellees’ timely requests. Exhibits 1 and 2.\n                                         2\n\f                             MOTION TO DISMISS\n\nI.    An appellate court must consider whether it has jurisdiction of an\n      interlocutory appeal before proceeding to determine the merits.\n\n      “[T]he general rule, with a few mostly statutory exceptions, is that an appeal\n\nmay be taken only from a final judgment.” Lehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d\n\n191, 195 (Tex. 2001); see also Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 51.012 (“a person may\n\ntake an appeal…from a final judgment of the district or county court.”) An\n\ninterlocutory order is appealable “only if a statute explicitly provides appellate\n\njurisdiction.” Stary v. DeBord, 967 S.W.2d 352, 352-353 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      An appellate court has no basis to issue an opinion about the merits of an\n\ninterlocutory appeal if it lacks jurisdiction. Id. at 354. See also, Herrera v. Texas\n\nDepartment of Family and Protective Services, 2007 WL 2044580 (Tex.App.—\n\nSan Antonio 2007, no pet.)(per curiam). An appellate court should determine its\n\njurisdiction to consider the interlocutory appeal before reaching the merits.\n\nMinton v. Gunn, 355 S.W.3d 634, 639 (Tex. 2011).\n\n      Courts narrowly construe statutes authorizing interlocutory appeals because\n\nthey are a “narrow exception to the general rule that only final judgments are\n\nappealable.” City of Houston v. Estate of Jones, 388 S.W.3d 663, 666 (Tex.\n\n2012)(per curiam). UIW appears to present an issue no other private institution of\n\nhigher education has raised: Can a private university can claim both “charitable\n\nimmunity” and “governmental unit” status?\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      Two appellate courts held they lacked jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals\n\nby police officers employed by private institutions like UIW because the officers\n\nwere are not “an officer or employee of the state or a political subdivision of the\n\nstate” under § 51.014(a)(5). Rice Univ. v. Rafaey, 413 S.W.3d 667, 661 (Tex.App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. filed); and Methodist Hosp. v. Miller, 405 S.W.3d\n\n101 112 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2012, no pet.). The Rice court noted that Rice University\n\ndid not claim any other jurisdictional basis for the interlocutory appeal. Id. at 671.\n\nIn its attempt to avoid these decisions, UIW attempts to claim “governmental unit”\n\nstatus for itself. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 51.014(a)(8).\n\nII.   This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the denial of UIW’s\n      plea to the jurisdiction because UIW is not a “governmental unit”\n      as defined by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.001(3).\n\n      An interlocutory appeal is not allowed following the grant or denial of a plea\n\nto the jurisdiction unless the plea is made by a “governmental unit.” See Critical\n\nAir Medicine, Inc. v. Shepard, 2005 WL 3533130 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 2005,\n\nno pet.)(dismissing interlocutory appeal filed under § 51.014(a)(8) by private\n\ncorporation); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Shores, 128 S.W.3d 718, 721 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth\n\n2004, no pet.) (same); Cantu Services, v. United Freedom Associates, Inc. 329\n\nS.W.3d 58, 64 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2010, no pet.).\n\n      This Court noted in Critical Air:\n\n      It is undisputed that Critical Air is a private corporation and not an\n      agency of state government, a political subdivision of the state, or an\n      institution, agency or organ of government whose status and authority\n      is derived from state law.\n\n                                          4\n\fId. at *2. Similarly, it is undisputed that UIW is a private university and not a state\n\ngovernment agency. This Court should dismiss this appeal.\n\nIII.   Neither UIW nor its Campus Police is not a “governmental unit”\n       under the Texas Tort Claims Act.\n\n       UIW expressly seeks the protections of the Texas Tort Claims Act as a\n\n“governmental unit.” C.R. at 120 (UIW’s First Amended Answer at ¶ 63-64). UIW\n\nargues that its police department draws its right to exist from a statute (Tex. Educ.\n\nCode § 51.212) and that the department and its officers are licensed by the Texas\n\nCommission on Law Enforcement, a “regulatory state agency.” Id. UIW, in its\n\nappellate brief, cites no case law holding that any part of a private university is a\n\n“governmental unit.”\n\n       A.    No Texas court has ever held that a private institution is a\n             “governmental unit” in the absence of a specific statute and\n             government funding of the service at issue.\n\n       No Texas court has ever held that a private, non-profit institution of higher\n\neducation is a “governmental unit” in the absence of a statute defining the\n\ninstitution and its actions as such. In Klein v. Hernandez, 315, S.W.2d 1, 2 (Tex.\n\n2010), the plaintiff sued Baylor College of Medicine for malpractice by its\n\nphysicians at Ben Taub Hospital, a public hospital. The Supreme Court noted that:\n\n       Baylor [College of Medicine] is a private, non-profit medical school,\n       but is also a ‘supported medical school,’ which means that it has\n       contracts with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and\n       receives state funding specifically allocated for training physicians\n       who provide medical care at public hospitals such as Ben Taub.\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fThe Court noted that private medical school derived its status as a “governmental\n\nunit” from Tex. Health & Safety Code § 312.006(a), which defines Baylor as a\n\n“governmental unit” when its doctors are working at public hospitals. Id. at 8.\n\n      In contrast to the Baylor College of Medicine, UIW has no claim to a contract\n\nwith a state agency, to receiving state funding, or to a statute defining any part of\n\nthe university as a “governmental unit.” UIW does not even address the\n\nimplications of the Texas Supreme Court’s Klein holding, choosing instead to rely\n\nalmost completely on LTTS Charter School, Inc. v. C2 Construction, Inc., 342\n\nS.W.3d 73 (Tex. 2011). See Appellant’s Brief at 24-26.\n\n      The Supreme Court, in LTTS Charter School, held that an open-enrollment\n\ncharter school operated as part of the public school system is a “governmental\n\nunit.” Id. at 76. The Supreme Court’s opinion drew a vigorous dissent (id. at 82),\n\nand the case is easily distinguishable from UIW’s claims. Charter schools by statute\n\nare “part of the public school system” which bears “the primary responsibility for\n\nimplementing the state's system of public education.” Id. at 82. Charter schools\n\nreceive government funding and operate within the Texas public school testing\n\nsystem. Id. at 74.\n\n      UIW, by contrast, has specifically and purposely chosen to operate outside\n\nTexas’ system of public higher education. See Tex. Educ. Code § 61.003, with\n\ndefinitions of “public senior college or university” and “private or independent\n\ninstitution of higher education.” UIW identifies itself as:\n\n\n                                          6\n\f      an incorporated charitable institution created and sponsored by the\n      Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, a Catholic order of nuns. The\n      Sisters established the school in 1881, devoted to providing education\n      without private gain. The UIW is a charitable institution under both\n      Texas and Federal law.\n\nC.R. 109. State and private institutions of higher education have different enabling\n\nstatutes for establishing campus police departments. Compare Tex. Educ. Code\n\n§ 51.203 (state) and § 51.212 (private).\n\n      UIW also cites Zacharie v. City of San Antonio by and through San Antonio\n\nWater System Board of Trustees, 952 S.W.2d 56, 59 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1997,\n\nno writ) and City of Leon Valley Economic Development Corporation v. Little, 422\n\nS.W.3d S.W.3d 37, 40 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 2013, no pet.) as supporting its\n\nargument. Both cases are distinguishable. In Zacharie, this Court held that San\n\nAntonio’s Water System was a city agent and thus entitled to immunity.\n\n      In Leon Valley, this Court held that an economic development corporation’s\n\n(“EDC”) statutory designation as a “governmental unit” under Tex. Loc. Gov. Code\n\n§ 505.106(b) did not protect it from contractual liability, although the status did\n\nauthorized the EDC to file an interlocutory appeal. In allowing the interlocutory\n\nappeal to proceed, this Court followed the EDC’s enabling statute: “For purposes\n\nof Chapter 101, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, a Type B corporation is a\n\ngovernmental unit and the corporation’s actions are governmental functions.”\n\nTex. Loc. Gov. Code § 505.106(b). Neither this Court nor any other Texas court has\n\nheld that that a private institution is a governmental unit in the absence of a\n\nspecific statute and government funding of the services at issue.\n                                           7\n\f      B.     That a statute authorizes UIW to establish a Campus Police\n             Department does not make the UIW Campus Police a\n             “governmental unit.”\n\n      Section 101.001(3)(D) of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code defines a\n\n“governmental unit” as\n\n      any other institution, agency, or organ of government the status and\n      authority of which are derived from the Constitution of Texas or from\n      laws passed by the legislature under the constitution.\n\nUIW argues that a Texas statute—Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212—authorizes the\n\ncreation of UIW’s police department, that its officers are licensed by a state agency,\n\nand that they enforce state law. Appellant’s Brief at 17-24.\n\n      So, UIW’s argument goes, the UIW Campus Police Department is an\n\n“institution, agency, or organ of government the…authority of which [is] derived\n\nfrom…laws passed by the legislature.” The argument proves too much ignoring the\n\nfact that UIW as private university is not an “institution, agency, or organ of\n\ngovernment.”\n\n      The only case applying this statute to any extent is LTTS Charter School,\n\nInc., 342 S.W.3d at 80. The Supreme Court held only that § 101.001(3)(D) does not\n\nrequire a statute specifically establishing the government agency. The Court’s\n\nholding, however, is primarily based on Tex. Educ. Code § 12.105: “An open-\n\nenrollment charter school is part of the public school system” and the public\n\nschools are governmental units. See §101.001(3)(B).\n\n      UIW’s argument misinterprets §101.001(3)(D). According to the Supreme\n\nCourt, an “open-enrollment charter school” is an “institution, agency, or organ of\n                                          8\n\fgovernment” because it is “part of the public school system.” Id. at 82. Unlike open\n\nenrollment public charter schools, UIW has no claim to being part of a “state\n\ninstitution of higher education” or part of the “field of public higher education.”\n\nSee Tex. Educ. Code § 51.203 (enabling statute for police departments at state\n\nuniversities) and § 61.002 (enabling statute for the Texas Higher Education\n\nCoordinating Board). UIW has specifically chosen to avoid the extensive state\n\nregulation of higher education, such as tuition regulation and degree offerings. See\n\nTex. Educ. Code Title 3 generally.\n\n      Textually—as the statute requires—UIW cannot establish that it is a\n\ngovernmental “institution, agency, or organ.” See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\n§ 101.001(3)(D). Merely being an “institution, agency, or organ” whose existence is\n\nenabled by a statute and governed by a state agency does make the “institution,\n\nagency, or organ” a “governmental unit.”\n\n      For example, Texas lawyers draw their right to practice law in Texas courts\n\nand to form law firms from the State Bar of Texas, “a public corporation and an\n\nadministrative agency of the judicial department of government.” See Tex. Govt.\n\nCode § 81.011. Only persons licensed by the State Bar of Texas can be employed as\n\nlawyers in law firms.\n\n      Texas barbers draw their authority to “perform any act of barbering” from\n\nTex. Occ. Code § 1601.251 and Texas barbershops draw their authority to exist from\n\nTex. Occ. Code § 1601.301. Barbers and barbershops are governed by a state\n\nlicensing agency, the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (“TDLR”), a\n                                         9\n\f“regulatory state agency,” pursuant to administrative rules. See Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§ 82.1, et seq. Neither barbers nor barbershops are turned into a “governmental\n\nunit” by these statutes.\n\n      The same could be said for numerous other respectable occupations. But\n\nneither barbershops nor law firms are entitled to call themselves “governmental\n\nunits” and claim the immunities of the TTCA when sued in tort.\n\n      C.     Allowing UIW’s campus police to enforce state and\n             municipal law in limited circumstances does not turn UIW\n             or its police department into a “governmental unit.”\n\n       UIW argues that the authority of its Campus Police and the individually\n\nlicensed officer to enforce state law bolsters its claim to be a “governmental unit.”\n\nSee Appellant’s Brief at 19-23. The truth, however, is that any person can enforce\n\na good portion of Texas criminal law without a TCOLE license.\n\n      Article 14.01(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows:\n\n      A peace officer or any other person, may, without a warrant, arrest an\n      offender when the offense is committed in his presence or within his\n      view, if the offense is one classed as a felony or as an offense against\n      the public peace.\n\nThe statute grants both peace officers and private citizens the same rights of\n\nwarrantless arrest for the two broadly defined categories of crimes. See Ofﬁce of\n\nthe Attorney General, Texas, Opinion No. MW-537, Dec. 22, 1987 (citing\n\nAlexander v. United States, 390 F.2d 101 (5th Cir. 1968); Romo v. State, 577\n\nS.W.2d 251 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Woods v. State, 213 S.W.2d 685 (Tex. Crim.\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fApp. 1948) (“Any individual may make a ‘citizen’s arrest’ under that provision,\n\nprovided that all applicable legal requirements are met.”)\n\n      No Texas court has ever held that a statute authorizing a private entity to\n\nenforce state law makes that entity an “institution, agency, or organ of\n\ngovernment” for purposes of the Texas Tort Claims Act. See Tex. Code of Crim.\n\nProc. § 2.12 for an extended list of 36 types of peace officers and § 14.03 for the\n\nauthority given to the officers. UIW Campus Police are “officers commissioned\n\nunder… Subchapter E, Chapter 51, Education Code.” Tex. Code. Crim. Proc.\n\n§ 2.12(8). The officers’ authority is defined by § 14.03.\n\n      In its application for a “law enforcement agency number,” UIW identifies its\n\n“Requesting Governmental Body” as “University of the Incarnate Word.” C.R. 206.\n\nUIW’s Board of Trustees approved a resolution supporting the formation of the\n\npolice department. C.R. 350. As noted above, Texas law gives “governing boards of\n\nprivate institutions of higher education” the authority “to employ and commission\n\npolice officers.” Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212. Nothing about this process turns UIW\n\ninto a “governmental unit.” UIW’s Campus Police Department receives no\n\ngovernment funding and has no contract with any government agency.\n\n      The cases UIW cites in the appellate brief do not support its argument; they\n\ninstead hold that private entities subject themselves to Constitutional violations by\n\ntheir involvement with governmental functions. Appellant’s Brief at 19-20.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      For example, in Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296 (1966), the Supreme Court\n\nheld that private managers of a public park could not enforce racial segregation in\n\nthe park. In Rosborough v. Management & Training Corp., 350 F.3d 459, 461 (5th\n\nCir. 2003), the Fifth Circuit found that “private prison-management corporations\n\nand their employees may be sued under § 1983 by a prisoner who has suffered a\n\nconstitutional injury.” In other words, the cases cited by UIW hold that a private\n\nentity subjects itself to greater, not less, liability by taking on a government\n\nfunction. This is consistent with the statute providing limited immunity for peace\n\nofficers employed by private universities. See Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212(b)(1).\n\n\n\n       FOR THESE REASONS, appellees Valerie and Mickey Redus move and\n\nrespectfully pray that this Court dismiss with ten days’ notice this interlocutory\n\nappeal for want of jurisdiction under Tex. R. App. P. 42.3(a) and grant all other\n\nand further relief to which appellees are entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nLAW OFFICE OF BRENT C.

(“Mickey”) Redus move this Court to\n\ndismiss this interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction. Tex. R. Civ. P. 42.3(a).\n\nDefendant and appellant University of the Incarnate Word (“UIW”) filed this\n\ninterlocutory appeal after the trial court signed an order denying UIW’s Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction. This Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because UIW is not a\n\n“governmental unit” as defined in Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.001(3).\n\nInterlocutory orders are not appealable unless expressly authorized by statute, and\n\nUIW, as a private, non-profit institution of higher education, lacks a statutory basis\n\nfor invoking this Court’s appellate jurisdiction.\n\f                               INTRODUCTION\n\n      Appellees Valerie and Mickey Redus are the parents of Robert Cameron\n\nRedus. Trial court defendant Christopher Carter shot Cameron Redus five times,\n\nkilling him in the parking lot at Cameron’s off-campus apartment in Alamo Heights\n\non December 6, 2013. Appellant UIW employed Carter as an on-duty Campus\n\nPolice Officer when he shot Cameron.\n\n      Valerie and Mickey Redus sued UIW and Carter on May 6, 2014 for claims\n\narising from Cameron’s death. C.R. 1. UIW filed its Original Answer on June 2,\n\n2014 and removed the case to federal court. C.R. 22. UIW did not originally raise\n\na Texas Tort Claims Act affirmative defense but did claim immunity as a\n\n“charitable institution.” C.R. 34. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem Code § 84.003. The\n\nfederal court remanded this action to state court on November 25, 2014. C.R. 381.\n\n      UIW filed its First Amended Answer on February 13, 2015, adding the Texas\n\nTort Claims Act as an affirmative defense. C.R. 109. UIW also filed its Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction, claiming that plaintiffs’ claims are limited by the Texas Tort Claims\n\nAct because UIW—or at least its police department—is a “governmental unit.” C.R.\n\n125. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.001(3).\n\n      The trial court heard UIW’s plea to the jurisdiction on February 26, 2015 and\n\nsigned an order denying it on March 2, 2015. C.R. 418. UIW initiated this\n\ninterlocutory appeal of the denial on March 3, citing Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §\n\n51.014(a)(8) as this Court’s jurisdictional basis. C.R. 419. The trial court has not\n\nmade findings of fact despite appellees’ timely requests. Exhibits 1 and 2.\n                                         2\n\f                             MOTION TO DISMISS\n\nI.    An appellate court must consider whether it has jurisdiction of an\n      interlocutory appeal before proceeding to determine the merits.\n\n      “[T]he general rule, with a few mostly statutory exceptions, is that an appeal\n\nmay be taken only from a final judgment.” Lehmann v.

The Rice court noted that Rice University\n\ndid not claim any other jurisdictional basis for the interlocutory appeal.

This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the denial of UIW’s\n      plea to the jurisdiction because UIW is not a “governmental unit”\n      as defined by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 101.001(3).\n\n      An interlocutory appeal is not allowed following the grant or denial of a plea\n\nto the jurisdiction unless the plea is made by a “governmental unit.” See Critical\n\nAir Medicine, Inc. v.

App.—El Paso 2010, no pet.).\n\n      This Court noted in Critical Air:\n\n      It is undisputed that Critical Air is a private corporation and not an\n      agency of state government, a political subdivision of the state, or an\n      institution, agency or organ of government whose status and authority\n      is derived from state law.\n\n                                          4\n\fId. at *2. Similarly, it is undisputed that UIW is a private university and not a state\n\ngovernment agency. This Court should dismiss this appeal.\n\nIII.   Neither UIW nor its Campus Police is not a “governmental unit”\n       under the Texas Tort Claims Act.\n\n       UIW expressly seeks the protections of the Texas Tort Claims Act as a\n\n“governmental unit.” C.R. at 120 (UIW’s First Amended Answer at ¶ 63-64). UIW\n\nargues that its police department draws its right to exist from a statute (Tex. Educ.\n\nCode § 51.212) and that the department and its officers are licensed by the Texas\n\nCommission on Law Enforcement, a “regulatory state agency.” Id. UIW, in its\n\nappellate brief, cites no case law holding that any part of a private university is a\n\n“governmental unit.”\n\n       A.    No Texas court has ever held that a private institution is a\n             “governmental unit” in the absence of a specific statute and\n             government funding of the service at issue.\n\n       No Texas court has ever held that a private, non-profit institution of higher\n\neducation is a “governmental unit” in the absence of a statute defining the\n\ninstitution and its actions as such. In Klein v. Hernandez, 315, S.W.2d 1, 2 (Tex.\n\n2010), the plaintiff sued Baylor College of Medicine for malpractice by its\n\nphysicians at Ben Taub Hospital, a public hospital. The Supreme Court noted that:\n\n       Baylor [College of Medicine] is a private, non-profit medical school,\n       but is also a ‘supported medical school,’ which means that it has\n       contracts with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and\n       receives state funding specifically allocated for training physicians\n       who provide medical care at public hospitals such as Ben Taub.\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fThe Court noted that private medical school derived its status as a “governmental\n\nunit” from Tex. Health & Safety Code § 312.006(a), which defines Baylor as a\n\n“governmental unit” when its doctors are working at public hospitals. Id. at 8.\n\n      In contrast to the Baylor College of Medicine, UIW has no claim to a contract\n\nwith a state agency, to receiving state funding, or to a statute defining any part of\n\nthe university as a “governmental unit.” UIW does not even address the\n\nimplications of the Texas Supreme Court’s Klein holding, choosing instead to rely\n\nalmost completely on LTTS Charter School, Inc. v. C2 Construction, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2540054\"><a href=\"/opinion/2540054/ltts-charter-school-inc-v-c2-constr-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011). See Appellant’s Brief at 24-26.\n\n      The Supreme Court, in LTTS Charter School, held that an open-enrollment\n\ncharter school operated as part of the public school system is a “governmental\n\nunit.” Id. at 76. The Supreme Court’s opinion drew a vigorous dissent (id. at 82),\n\nand the case is easily distinguishable from UIW’s claims. Charter schools by statute\n\nare “part of the public school system” which bears “the primary responsibility for\n\nimplementing the state's system of public education.” Id. at 82. Charter schools\n\nreceive government funding and operate within the Texas public school testing\n\nsystem. Id. at 74.\n\n      UIW, by contrast, has specifically and purposely chosen to operate outside\n\nTexas’ system of public higher education. See Tex. Educ. Code § 61.003, with\n\ndefinitions of “public senior college or university” and “private or independent\n\ninstitution of higher education.” UIW identifies itself as:\n\n\n                                          6\n\f      an incorporated charitable institution created and sponsored by the\n      Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, a Catholic order of nuns. The\n      Sisters established the school in 1881, devoted to providing education\n      without private gain. The UIW is a charitable institution under both\n      Texas and Federal law.\n\nC.R. 109. State and private institutions of higher education have different enabling\n\nstatutes for establishing campus police departments. Compare Tex. Educ. Code\n\n§ 51.203 (state) and § 51.212 (private).\n\n      UIW also cites Zacharie v. City of San Antonio by and through San Antonio\n\nWater System Board of Trustees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2408544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2408544/zacharie-v-san-antonio-water-system-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1997,\n\nno writ) and City of Leon Valley Economic Development Corporation v. Little, 422\n\nS.W.3d S.W.3d 37, 40 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 2013, no pet.) as supporting its\n\nargument. Both cases are distinguishable. In Zacharie, this Court held that San\n\nAntonio’s Water System was a city agent and thus entitled to immunity.\n\n      In Leon Valley, this Court held that an economic development corporation’s\n\n(“EDC”) statutory designation as a “governmental unit” under Tex. Loc. Gov. Code\n\n§ 505.106(b) did not protect it from contractual liability, although the status did\n\nauthorized the EDC to file an interlocutory appeal. In allowing the interlocutory\n\nappeal to proceed, this Court followed the EDC’s enabling statute: “For purposes\n\nof Chapter 101, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, a Type B corporation is a\n\ngovernmental unit and the corporation’s actions are governmental functions.”\n\nTex. Loc. Gov. Code § 505.106(b). Neither this Court nor any other Texas court has\n\nheld that that a private institution is a governmental unit in the absence of a\n\nspecific statute and government funding of the services at issue.\n                                           7\n\f      B.     That a statute authorizes UIW to establish a Campus Police\n             Department does not make the UIW Campus Police a\n             “governmental unit.”\n\n      Section 101.001(3)(D) of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code defines a\n\n“governmental unit” as\n\n      any other institution, agency, or organ of government the status and\n      authority of which are derived from the Constitution of Texas or from\n      laws passed by the legislature under the constitution.\n\nUIW argues that a Texas statute—Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212—authorizes the\n\ncreation of UIW’s police department, that its officers are licensed by a state agency,\n\nand that they enforce state law. Appellant’s Brief at 17-24.\n\n      So, UIW’s argument goes, the UIW Campus Police Department is an\n\n“institution, agency, or organ of government the…authority of which [is] derived\n\nfrom…laws passed by the legislature.” The argument proves too much ignoring the\n\nfact that UIW as private university is not an “institution, agency, or organ of\n\ngovernment.”\n\n      The only case applying this statute to any extent is LTTS Charter School,\n\nInc., 342 S.W.3d at 80. The Supreme Court held only that § 101.001(3)(D) does not\n\nrequire a statute specifically establishing the government agency. The Court’s\n\nholding, however, is primarily based on Tex. Educ. Code § 12.105: “An open-\n\nenrollment charter school is part of the public school system” and the public\n\nschools are governmental units. See §101.001(3)(B).\n\n      UIW’s argument misinterprets §101.001(3)(D). According to the Supreme\n\nCourt, an “open-enrollment charter school” is an “institution, agency, or organ of\n                                          8\n\fgovernment” because it is “part of the public school system.” Id. at 82. Unlike open\n\nenrollment public charter schools, UIW has no claim to being part of a “state\n\ninstitution of higher education” or part of the “field of public higher education.”\n\nSee Tex. Educ. Code § 51.203 (enabling statute for police departments at state\n\nuniversities) and § 61.002 (enabling statute for the Texas Higher Education\n\nCoordinating Board). UIW has specifically chosen to avoid the extensive state\n\nregulation of higher education, such as tuition regulation and degree offerings. See\n\nTex. Educ. Code Title 3 generally.\n\n      Textually—as the statute requires—UIW cannot establish that it is a\n\ngovernmental “institution, agency, or organ.” See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\n§ 101.001(3)(D). Merely being an “institution, agency, or organ” whose existence is\n\nenabled by a statute and governed by a state agency does make the “institution,\n\nagency, or organ” a “governmental unit.”\n\n      For example, Texas lawyers draw their right to practice law in Texas courts\n\nand to form law firms from the State Bar of Texas, “a public corporation and an\n\nadministrative agency of the judicial department of government.” See Tex. Govt.\n\nCode § 81.011. Only persons licensed by the State Bar of Texas can be employed as\n\nlawyers in law firms.\n\n      Texas barbers draw their authority to “perform any act of barbering” from\n\nTex. Occ. Code § 1601.251 and Texas barbershops draw their authority to exist from\n\nTex. Occ. Code § 1601.301. Barbers and barbershops are governed by a state\n\nlicensing agency, the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (“TDLR”), a\n                                         9\n\f“regulatory state agency,” pursuant to administrative rules. See Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§ 82.1, et seq. Neither barbers nor barbershops are turned into a “governmental\n\nunit” by these statutes.\n\n      The same could be said for numerous other respectable occupations. But\n\nneither barbershops nor law firms are entitled to call themselves “governmental\n\nunits” and claim the immunities of the TTCA when sued in tort.\n\n      C.     Allowing UIW’s campus police to enforce state and\n             municipal law in limited circumstances does not turn UIW\n             or its police department into a “governmental unit.”\n\n       UIW argues that the authority of its Campus Police and the individually\n\nlicensed officer to enforce state law bolsters its claim to be a “governmental unit.”\n\nSee Appellant’s Brief at 19-23. The truth, however, is that any person can enforce\n\na good portion of Texas criminal law without a TCOLE license.\n\n      Article 14.01(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows:\n\n      A peace officer or any other person, may, without a warrant, arrest an\n      offender when the offense is committed in his presence or within his\n      view, if the offense is one classed as a felony or as an offense against\n      the public peace.\n\nThe statute grants both peace officers and private citizens the same rights of\n\nwarrantless arrest for the two broadly defined categories of crimes.

See Tex. Code of Crim.\n\nProc. § 2.12 for an extended list of 36 types of peace officers and § 14.03 for the\n\nauthority given to the officers. UIW Campus Police are “officers commissioned\n\nunder… Subchapter E, Chapter 51, Education Code.” Tex. Code. Crim. Proc.\n\n§ 2.12(8). The officers’ authority is defined by § 14.03.\n\n      In its application for a “law enforcement agency number,” UIW identifies its\n\n“Requesting Governmental Body” as “University of the Incarnate Word.” C.R. 206.\n\nUIW’s Board of Trustees approved a resolution supporting the formation of the\n\npolice department. C.R. 350. As noted above, Texas law gives “governing boards of\n\nprivate institutions of higher education” the authority “to employ and commission\n\npolice officers.” Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212. Nothing about this process turns UIW\n\ninto a “governmental unit.” UIW’s Campus Police Department receives no\n\ngovernment funding and has no contract with any government agency.\n\n      The cases UIW cites in the appellate brief do not support its argument; they\n\ninstead hold that private entities subject themselves to Constitutional violations by\n\ntheir involvement with governmental functions. Appellant’s Brief at 19-20.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      For example, in Evans v. Newton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107137\"><a href=\"/opinion/107137/evans-v-newton/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966), the Supreme Court\n\nheld that private managers of a public park could not enforce racial segregation in\n\nthe park. In Rosborough v. Management & Training Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"33219\"><a href=\"/opinion/33219/rosborough-v-mgmt-training-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461 (5th\n\nCir. 2003), the Fifth Circuit found that “private prison-management corporations\n\nand their employees may be sued under § 1983 by a prisoner who has suffered a\n\nconstitutional injury.” In other words, the cases cited by UIW hold that a private\n\nentity subjects itself to greater, not less, liability by taking on a government\n\nfunction. This is consistent with the statute providing limited immunity for peace\n\nofficers employed by private universities. See Tex. Educ. Code § 51.212(b)(1).\n\n\n\n       FOR THESE REASONS, appellees Valerie and Mickey Redus move and\n\nrespectfully pray that this Court dismiss with ten days’ notice this interlocutory\n\nappeal for want of jurisdiction under Tex. R. App. P. 42.3(a) and grant all other\n\nand further relief to which appellees are entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nLAW OFFICE OF BRENT C.
