Hopkins County contracted with Southern Health Partners,\nInc. (SHP), a private, for-profit corporation, to provide medical services to inmates housed at the\nHopkins County Detention Center (HCDC) in Madisonville, Kentucky.              On April 8, 2010,\ntwenty-five year old Tyler Butler entered the jail to serve a short sentence for a misdemeanor\noffense.   He died three days later from complications of an untreated methicillin-resistant\nstaphylococcus aureas (MRSA) infection.\n\n       Butler’s mother, Cindy (Jimenez) Shadrick, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging\nthat SHP’s failure to train and supervise its LPN nurses employed at HCDC violated Butler’s\nconstitutional right to adequate medical care. She also alleged that SHP was negligent under\nstate law. The district court granted summary judgment for SHP on both claims. Jimenez v.\nHopkins Cnty., No. 4:11-CV-00033, 2014 WL 176478, at *19–20, 22–23 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 13,\n2014). Because the record demonstrates that there are genuine issues of material fact on the\n§ 1983 claim and SHP is not entitled to share the county’s governmental immunity on the state-\nlaw claim, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment in favor of SHP and REMAND the\ncase to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n                                             I. FACTS\n\n       Butler arrived at HCDC close to five o’clock on the afternoon of Thursday, April 8, 2010.\nHe was late for his scheduled intake appointment, having walked from his residence. While\nButler stood outside the door, Sherri McDowell, control tower operator, saw Butler put\nsomething in his mouth and swallow it. McDowell relayed her observation to Deputy Angela\nPeterson who, along with Deputy Rodney Knox, started Butler’s booking procedures.\n\n       As Deputy Knox helped Butler change into a prison uniform, Butler vomited twice.\nDeputy Peterson noticed that Butler appeared to be under the influence and was sweating\nprofusely. As she asked him questions to complete intake paperwork, his demeanor deteriorated\nand he had difficulty standing up.\n\fNo. 14-5603                          Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                       Page 3\n\n        Butler told Deputy Peterson that he had an MRSA infection and he was under a doctor’s\ncare for high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and osteoporosis. He listed several\nprescribed medications he was taking, including Prednisone, Seroquel, Allopurinol, and\nColchicine.1 Butler denied drug or alcohol addiction.\n\n        Deputies Peterson and Knox did not want to admit Butler to HCDC due to his condition.\nDeputy Peterson asked Sgt. Carl Coy if she could refuse admission to an inmate who reported to\nHCDC pursuant to a court order. Sgt. Coy replied, in alignment with HCDC’s written policy,\nthat only the medical staff possessed authority to refuse admission of an inmate for health\nreasons.\n\n        Deputy Peterson asked Candace Moss, SHP’s licensed practical nurse (LPN) and the only\nmedical staff member on duty at the jail, to come to the booking area. It was 5:25 p.m., shortly\nbefore shift change at 6:00 p.m. Moss knew she had to decide whether to admit Butler to\nHCDC. He told her that he had frequent staph infections, that he was suffering from a staph\ninfection in his groin area that his doctor had not examined, and that he had been vomiting,\nwhich he attributed to the staph infection. He also reported having a different rash that his doctor\nhad not diagnosed.\n\n        As Moss talked with Butler, Deputy Jennifer Chambers noticed that Butler’s skin was\nclammy, he was almost gray in color, and he was bloated. She saw Butler lift his shirt and pants\nlegs to show Moss open wounds on his skin. He pulled his pants down slightly to show Moss\npart of his groin area. Deputy Chambers heard Butler say, “I have staph infection all over me . . .\nit’s in my groin. . . . I don’t need to be here.”\n\n        Moss instructed the deputies to admit Butler to the jail. As an LPN, she knew she lacked\nthe credentials to diagnose any illness, but she was aware that MRSA infection could lead to\nsepsis and death if not treated. She asked the chief deputy to accompany her as she physically\nexamined Butler, but he declined and told her not to worry about it. Moss returned to the\nmedical office where she wrote a short incident report at 5:40 p.m., placing Butler on 72-hour\n\n\n        1\n          According to Shadrick, Butler also took Lortab, a controlled substance, for arthritis pain and Benicar for\nhypertension.\n\fNo. 14-5603                          Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                       Page 4\n\ndetoxification for suspected drug use and on medical watch due to his reported staph infection.2\nMoss admitted that she did not contact SHP’s Medical Director for HCDC, Dr. Henry Davis, to\nrequest medical orders for Butler’s care during the detoxification period.\n\n        SHP’s “Intoxication and Withdrawal Policy” provided that “[d]etoxification will be\ncarried out only under medical supervision and initiated by the medical staff with physician\noverview on an individual care basis.” R. 101-5 PageID 2037 (emphasis added); R. 84 PageID\n1407–08, 1418. The policy further required consistent monitoring, documentation of all findings\nin the inmate’s medical chart, and documentation of vital signs twice daily on an Alcohol and\nDrug Detox Flow Sheet. Anticipating the end of her shift, Moss expected that Andy Johnson,\nLPN, the nurse coming on duty, would take Butler’s vital signs, start the Alcohol and Drug\nDetox Flow Sheet, and monitor Butler’s condition.                   Moss told Johnson that she had not\nexamined Butler. When Johnson started his shift, he did not examine Butler or record his vital\nsigns on an Alcohol and Drug Detox Flow Sheet. He did not call Dr. Davis for orders to manage\nButler’s medical conditions or to insure continuity of prescription medications.\n\n        HCDC staff assigned Butler to cell 203, located across from the booking area. His bed\nconsisted of a mat placed on a concrete slab three to four inches off the floor. Although HCDC\nstaff placed Butler on suicide watch, there is no evidence that Butler was evaluated for suicidal\nideation.\n\n        During Butler’s short stay at HCDC, his blood pressure was taken once each day on\nApril 9, 10, and 11 at unknown times, as shown on a “Blood Pressure Record Form” bearing the\nnurse initials “AJ.” Nurse Andy Johnson did not recall ever touching Butler. Each reading\nshowed a decrease in blood pressure, but there is no evidence that Butler received blood pressure\nmedication during his confinement or that the nurses took steps to assess why his blood pressure\nwas falling in the absence of medication. A “Medication Administration Record” indicates\nButler received Allopurinol twice on April 9, Prednisone twice on April 9, and Quetiapine\n(Seroquel) once on April 9; however, SHP stated under oath in response to a discovery\ninterrogatory that “Butler’s medical record does not reflect that he was given any medications\n\n        2\n          Apparently, the nursing shift report documented that Butler “‘has a staph infection, no antibiotic—has not\nseen doctor—vomiting—rash all over body. Detox/Medical Watch x 72 hours.’” R. 101-3 PageID 2024. We have\nnot located a copy of this report in the record.\n\fNo. 14-5603                          Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                        Page 5\n\nduring his incarceration beginning on April 8, 2010.” R. 101-12 PageID 2051–52. Even if\nButler received medication at HCDC, there is no evidence it was prescribed by Dr. Davis.3\n\n        None of the nurses who worked shifts during Butler’s confinement at HCDC followed\nSHP’s written policy guidelines for the treatment of staph and MRSA infections. Because these\ninfections can progress rapidly, the policy instructs medical staff to: examine inmate skin\ninfections carefully; monitor the patient and document all medical findings; report the infection\nto the HCDC Medical Director and obtain orders for proper antibiotic treatment; seek emergency\nhospital care if the inmate’s condition worsens; notify jail staff to institute universal precautions\nto prevent spread of the infection; and report the infection to SHP’s corporate headquarters.\nThese steps were not taken after Butler reported his staph infection.\n\n        As medications were passed out to inmates late on Friday afternoon, April 9, Deputy\nKnox heard Butler tell Candace Moss through the food flap of his cell that he had a staph\ninfection. Although Butler was still on detoxification and suicide watch, Moss did not medically\nassess Butler’s condition. Moss later admitted that her failure to monitor Butler and chart his\nvital signs in the medical record violated written SHP policies.\n\n        At mid-afternoon on Saturday, April 10, Butler told Deputy Knox that he was too sick to\nbe in jail. He asked for a sick-call slip, which Deputy Knox provided. Knox and Deputy\nChambers discussed Butler’s bloated appearance and gray pallor, and Knox tried to persuade the\nSHP nurse on duty to see Butler. The record contains no evidence that a nurse examined Butler\nat that time.\n\n        Later on Saturday afternoon, Sgt. Coy accompanied an unknown nurse as she handed out\nmedications to inmates. When Butler stated that he was unable to get up from the floor and walk\n\n        3\n           According to Shadrick, Butler suffered from many medical conditions, including an ongoing MRSA\ninfection that required antibiotic treatments. During Butler’s 2007 confinement at HCDC for ninety days, the staff\nrefused to allow Butler to bring his prescription pain medication into the facility. The nursing staff asked Shadrick\nto refill her son’s 30-day supplies of Allopurinol and Colchicine only once during the 90-day confinement period.\nDuring that same incarceration, Butler contacted his mother repeatedly to report that he was not receiving his\nmedications and to ask for help. He told her that, without his medications, he became immobile and had vomiting\nand diarrhea. According to Shadrick, Butler pleaded, “Please help me. They’re going to let me die.” When\nShadrick called the jail to ask why Butler was not receiving his medications, the nurse told her that medications\nwere handed out to inmates twice each day, at 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. If the inmate did not walk to the cell door to\nreceive his medications, the nurse passed the cell without giving the inmate the medication. R. 86 & 86-1 Page ID\n1579–81, 1583, 1588.\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 6\n\nto the cell door to receive his medication, Sgt. Coy and the nurse entered the cell to give Butler\nmedication. The nurse did not converse with Butler or medically assess his condition. There is\nno written documentation that Butler actually received medication on Saturday.\n\n       Early Sunday morning, April 11, Deputy Brandon Lampton saw Butler sitting on the\nfloor of his cell, leaning against the wall. His elbows were red and swollen, and he was in\nobvious pain. Lampton asked Butler if he was okay; Butler replied, “I’m fine.” A few minutes\nlater, at 6:18 a.m., LPN nurse Renee Keller, SHP’s only medical staff member on duty, cleared\nButler from detoxification status early without examining or medically assessing his condition.\nShe wrote in the medical chart that Butler had to remain isolated due to staph infection.\n\n       As Deputy Lampton walked by the cell a few minutes later, Butler asked for a clean\nuniform because he had defecated on himself and he was in too much pain to move. Butler’s\njoints were swollen and hot to the touch. Lampton immediately reported the situation to the shift\ncommander. Lampton and Deputy Stephen O’Reilly lifted Butler from the floor, placed him in a\nrestraint chair, and pushed him to the shower. There the deputies transferred Butler to a plastic\nchair and helped him remove his clothing so that he could shower. Butler told them he was\nsuffering from rheumatoid arthritis. After the shower, the deputies helped Butler with toileting\nand dressing and returned him to his cell.\n\n       Lampton walked to the medical office to inform nurse Keller that Butler had been taken\nto the shower because he soiled his clothes. Lampton asked Keller if she knew about Butler’s\nswollen joints. Keller said she was aware of Butler’s situation and otherwise expressed no\nconcern. According to Lampton, deputy jailers commonly received similar responses from SHP\nmedical staff.\n\n       Within an hour, Lampton learned that Butler had defecated again. When Butler declined\nto take a second shower, Lampton handed him a clean uniform. Because Butler’s condition was\nnow “a real issue,” Lampton returned to the medical office, reported that Butler had diarrhea, and\nsuggested that Butler should be moved to a segregation cell with a higher bunk so that he could\nrotate himself onto the toilet. Keller showed no inclination to check on Butler. Lampton\ninformed his shift commander, Jeremy Witherspoon, that he was moving Butler to a segregation\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 7\n\ncell with a bunk. Lampton and Deputy Poe lifted Butler into the restraint chair and transferred\nhim to the new cell. Lampton had never seen an inmate with such limited mobility.\n\n        Keller’s testimony differed from Lampton’s. She testified that she checked on Butler\nwhile he was showering and helped put his shirt on; that it was her idea to move Butler to a\nsegregation cell with a bunk; and that she asked Butler if he needed anything and he told her he\ndid not. She did not check his vital signs, document her visit with him, or give him any\nmedication. She was not sure whether SHP’s written policies required her to take any such steps.\nShe stated that it was customary for SHP medical staff to examine an inmate only if he submitted\na sick call request.\n\n        On Sunday afternoon, HCDC deputies periodically checked on Butler, but the record\nincludes no documentation of his medical status. Deputies looked through the cell window only\nto confirm that he was breathing. Between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m., Butler asked Deputy Kreitler for\na drink of water because he could not get up. She told him to get the water from his cell faucet.\nButler again asked for a cup of water. Although Kreitler agreed to retrieve one, she never did so.\nWhen she returned to the cell at 4:19 p.m., Butler was lying awkwardly on his bunk,\nunresponsive. She entered the cell and shook him, but he did not respond. He did not have a\npulse and was cold to the touch.\n\n        Nurse Keller was called to the cell. She found Butler cold, blue-gray in color, and\nwithout a pulse. She did not begin CPR. At 4:25 p.m., she paged Dr. Davis, who did not\nrespond. At 4:27 p.m., she called Emergency Medical Services. The county coroner arrived\nshortly after 4:30 p.m. and pronounced Butler dead. An autopsy disclosed that he died of a\nsudden cardiac arrhythmia due to sepsis, a complication of MRSA infection. Significant co-\nexisting conditions were obesity with hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and coronary\natherosclerosis.\n\n        After Butler’s death, Keller called her supervisor, Andrea Pleasant, SHP’s medical team\nadministrator and nurse manager for HCDC. Pleasant had been out-of-town during most of\nButler’s incarceration.   Pleasant called her supervisor, SHP’s regional administrator Betty\nDawes, RN, to ask about completing necessary paperwork. At Dawes’s instruction, Pleasant\nwent to the jail, faxed some papers to SHP headquarters, made sure Keller had tried to call the\n\fNo. 14-5603                           Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                         Page 8\n\ndoctor, and then left. Jailer Joe Blue contacted SHP President and Chief of Operations, Jennifer\nHairsine, and asked her to come to HCDC to evaluate whether any changes should be made.4\n\n         On Monday, April 12, Hairsine and SHP Vice President of Operations, Lisa Watts,\nvisited HCDC. They met with Jailer Blue for fifteen to twenty minutes. Blue summarized the\nrecent events and reported the coroner’s suspicion that Butler had MRSA infection. They did not\ndiscuss Dr. Davis or the county’s contract with SHP. After talking with Blue, Hairsine and\nWatts spoke to Angela Pleasant and a nurse, but Hairsine did not think the nurse was Keller or\nJohnson. If Hairsine spoke to Moss, it was by telephone. Hairsine told Blue that “everything\nlooks fine” and demonstrated no concern that SHP medical personnel had acted improperly.\nAfter a two-hour visit, Hairsine and Watts returned to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Hairsine did not\nknow that Pleasant terminated Johnson’s employment that day.5\n\n         Jailer Blue admitted that he had not read SHP’s policies and procedures completely, but\nhe and his employees relied on SHP nurses and the Medical Director to make all medical\ndecisions concerning inmates. Blue acknowledged that, under Kentucky corrections policy,\nButler was entitled to receive health care comparable to that available to free citizens in the\nsurrounding community.\n\n         SHP is a privately-owned, for-profit Delaware corporation employing 800 workers,\nincluding more than 700 full- and part-time nurses. SHP maintains contracts with 198 jail\nfacilities, thirty of which are located in Kentucky. Other facilities are located in Tennessee,\nOhio, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and\nWisconsin. The company currently does not provide medical services to inmates of HCDC.\n\n         SHP contracted with Dr. Davis to serve as Medical Director at HCDC, but he denied any\nresponsibility for training or supervising SHP nurses. He characterized himself as a consultant\n\n         4\n           The district court record includes only three pages of Hairsine’s deposition. R. 76-2. SHP filed the entire\ndeposition as an appendix to its appellate brief. No. 14-5603 R. 12. Because Shadrick did not object to the filing of\nthe entire deposition, this opinion relies on portions of the deposition that may or may not have been available to the\ndistrict court. The district court’s opinion included citations to pages of Hairsine’s deposition that were not included\nin the lower court record, but we cannot tell whether the full deposition was manually submitted to the district court\nwithout filing or whether the district court adopted citations to the deposition that appeared in the parties’ briefs.\n         5\n          Johnson testified that he was terminated for making a mistake in mailing an inmate drug screen sample\nand not for conduct relating to Butler’s death.\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 9\n\nwho is available to answer questions. He denied providing any treatment protocols to SHP,\nalthough he probably did give some advice about administering insulin. He did not know that\nButler was confined at HCDC until he learned of Butler’s death.\n\n       LPN Candace Moss had never worked in a correctional facility before. She did not\nparticipate in any training program before reporting for work as a visiting nurse, and she could\nnot recall if she ever received a copy of SHP’s written policies and procedures. She did not\nremember signing a form acknowledging that she received the SHP policies and read them. On\nher first day of work at the Taylor County Jail, she received some on-the-job training from Betty\nDawes, SHP’s regional administrator in charge of several Kentucky jails. Moss had never met\nDr. Davis or spoken to him by telephone. She did not receive an evaluation during the eighteen\nmonths she worked for SHP. After Butler’s death, no one from SHP interviewed her about her\ninteractions with Butler.\n\n       LPN Andy Johnson gave similar testimony. He did not attend an SHP training program\nbefore starting work, although he received limited on-the-job training during his first two days of\nemployment, such as learning where supplies were kept. He did not recall ever seeing a copy of\nSHP’s written policies and procedures.\n\n       LPN Renee Keller testified that SHP did not provide her with any training on the SHP\npolicies or how she should perform her job. She recalled that Angela Pleasant conducted\nmeetings approximately every other month to go over policy changes or to explain something the\nnurses were not doing correctly. She remembered being told to read the SHP policies and she\nsigned a document confirming that she had done so, but she did not actually read all of the\npolicies, and she could not discuss any specifics of them during her testimony. She did not know\nwhether SHP policies required her to take Butler’s vital signs or check on him while he was\nconfined in segregation. No one from SHP supervised or critiqued her work or reviewed her\nmedical progress notes to be sure that she was following SHP policies. A large part of her job\ninvolved referring to protocol books without consulting the doctor. After Butler’s death, no one\nfrom SHP talked to her about Butler.\n\n       LPN Angela Pleasant testified that SHP did not require her to have a working knowledge\nof SHP’s written policies and procedures even though she was SHP’s medical administrator at\n\fNo. 14-5603                       Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..          Page 10\n\nHCDC. She consulted SHP’s policies only if problems arose. Although she was responsible for\nsupervising other nurses, she could not recall the policies on MRSA infection, segregation, or\nalcohol and drug detoxification. The nurses at HCDC followed an undocumented custom and\npractice of providing medical assistance only if an inmate asked for it or if there was an\nemergency. If an inmate reported a staph infection and vomiting, Pleasant would advise him to\nput in a sick-call slip and ask for help. If he did not do so within a few days, Pleasant would\nplace him on suicide watch. She reasoned that, if the inmate does not seek help, he must have\nsuicidal ideations. She would follow this course of conduct even though she knows that the\ninmate’s MRSA infection could rapidly deteriorate into sepsis and spread to other inmates and\nstaff in the jail. After Butler died, SHP did not reprimand her or any other nurse for failing to\nfollow any SHP policy.\n\n        Betty Dawes, an RN and SHP’s regional administrator, visited HCDC once every two to\nthree months for four hours or less and sometimes conducted audits. During the visits, she talked\nto the Jailer and the nurses and reviewed some records. She could not recall any issues that were\nraised during these visits. Ordinarily, Dawes does not train new nurses, but she will provide\ntraining if it is needed. She had never read HCDC’s policies, but she expected Angela Pleasant\nto be familiar with them. Dawes conceded that SHP nurses did not meet the standard of care in\nmonitoring and treating Butler and that they failed to follow SHP policies on alcohol and drug\ndetoxification, medical chart documentation, and treatment of MRSA infection. She did not help\ninvestigate Butler’s death or speak to Dr. Davis about it. Approximately two weeks after\nButler’s death, Dawes paid a two-hour “support visit” to the jail. No one had any questions for\nher and she did not ask to review Butler’s medical file. To her knowledge, Hairsine and Watts\ndid not visit the jail after Butler’s death.\n\n        According to President Hairsine, SHP bids a jail contract depending on what a county is\nwilling to pay for nurses. She believes that SHP nurses are trained by virtue of being licensed in\nKentucky, and they might receive additional training from the medical team administrator, the\nregional administrator or the vice-president of operations, all of whom are nurses. Hairsine does\nnot know how RNs and LPNs differ in medical training or how their scope of practice differs\nexcept that she is aware LPNs cannot diagnose medical conditions. SHP relies on the nurse to\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..           Page 11\n\ninform the company of her scope of practice and to notify the company if she is operating\noutside that scope. On one or two occasions, SHP regional administrators notified Hairsine that\ntheir LPN nurses had engaged in conduct outside their scope of practice. Hairsine is also aware\nthat SHP nurses sometimes follow a practice of documenting only medical abnormalities in\ninmate charts instead of maintaining consistent chart documentation.\n\n        Hairsine was fully involved in drafting SHP’s policies and procedures, which are\nreviewed every six months. Hairsine stated that SHP nurses are required to read the policies and\nsign a document stating they have done so, but SHP allows the nurses to implement the written\npolicies at their discretion.\n\n        Hairsine further testified, in contradiction to HCDC’s written policy, that SHP nurses can\nonly recommend to HCDC staff that an inmate should be admitted to the facility; the ultimate\nauthority to make the admission decision lies with HCDC administrators, not SHP staff. In\ncontrast to Dr. Davis’s testimony, Hairsine stated that the Medical Director is responsible for\nsupervising medical personnel at HCDC, including the medical team administrator, Pleasant.\nHairsine spoke to Dr. Davis by telephone after Butler died. Although Dr. Davis expressed\nconcern that he did not know Butler was housed at HCDC, Hairsine thought Dr. Davis did not\npossess any information suggesting that the SHP nurses should have called him about Butler.\n\n        Finally, Hairsine was unaware of any previous complaints about SHP staff who worked\nat HCDC. She conducts a file review after every reported inmate death, but usually she does not\nvisit the jail facility where the death occurred.\n\n        After reviewing this and other evidence, Shadrick’s medical expert, Madeleine LaMarre,\nopined that SHP failed to establish an adequate health care system to meet the serious medical\nneeds of the inmate population at HCDC. In her opinion, all of the SHP nurses who had contact\nwith Butler violated generally accepted standards of nursing practice and all of them exceeded\nthe legal scope of their practice as LPNs licensed in Kentucky. LaMarre further opined that SHP\nfailed to hire sufficient numbers of qualified medical professionals to work at HCDC, and\nbecause LPNs “are not licensed to make independent nursing assessments or nursing diagnoses,\n. . . the use of standing orders and treatment protocols by LPNs is not consistent with Kentucky\nnursing practice standards. Thus, LPNs should be directly supervised by a registered nurse or\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                 Page 12\n\nphysician.” PageID 2032. Because this was not the case at HCDC, LaMarre concluded that the\nSHP nurses practiced without sufficient clinical oversight. She characterized the situation as\nillegal and dangerous, opining that the lack of training and supervision of LPN nurses directly\ncontributed to Butler not receiving appropriate medical treatment, ultimately leading to his death.\n\n       LaMarre observed that this was not the first time Butler had been denied access to a\nqualified health care provider who could diagnose and treat his medical conditions.            She\nprovided several examples of nurses making medical decisions beyond the scope of their practice\nduring Butler’s previous confinements at HCDC in 2007 and 2008. Finally, LaMarre opined that\nSHP did not train the staff adequately on the health care policies and procedures or maintain a\nfunctioning quality improvement program to monitor compliance with SHP policies and\nprocedures.\n\n       On this record, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of SHP, and\nShadrick now appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                 II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment. Cass v. City of Dayton,\n770 F.3d 368, 373 (6th Cir. 2014). Summary judgment is appropriate if, viewing the facts and\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there are no genuine\nissues of material fact for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Cass, 770 F.3d at 373.\n\n                                         III. ANALYSIS\n\n       Shadrick seeks reversal on two grounds. First, she contends there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact remaining for trial on her § 1983 claim against SHP for failure to train and\nsupervise its LPN nurses. She further argues that she produced sufficient proof to proceed\nagainst SHP on a theory of negligence and that SHP is not entitled to qualified official immunity\non this claim under Kentucky state law. We begin with the federal claim.\n\nA. Failure to train and supervise\n\n       To prevail on a cause of action under § 1983, a plaintiff must prove “(1) the deprivation\nof a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States (2) caused by a person acting\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 13\n\nunder the color of state law.” Jones v. Muskegon Cnty., 625 F.3d 935, 941 (6th Cir. 2010)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The second requirement is not in question. Our court has\nheld that private corporations performing traditional state functions, such as the provision of\nmedical services to prison inmates, act under color of state law for purposes of § 1983. Rouster\nv. Cnty. of Saginaw, 749 F.3d 437, 453 (6th Cir. 2014). The parties here, like those in Arflack v.\nCounty of Henderson, 412 F. App’x 829, 830 n.2 (6th Cir. 2011)—prior litigation involving\nSHP—do not dispute that SHP stands in the shoes of Hopkins County for purposes of § 1983\nliability.\n\n        The constitutional right at issue arises from the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel\nand unusual punishment because Butler was serving a criminal sentence at the time he died at\nHCDC. See Shreve v. Franklin Cnty., 743 F.3d 126, 133 (6th Cir. 2014). That Amendment\nbarred SHP and its employees from unnecessarily and wantonly inflicting pain on Butler through\ndeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Id. In the Supreme Court’s words,\n\n        elementary principles establish the government’s obligation to provide medical\n        care to those whom it is punishing by incarceration. An inmate must rely on\n        prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those\n        needs will not be met. In the worst cases, such a failure may actually produce\n        physical “torture or a lingering death,” the evils of most immediate concern to the\n        drafters of the [Eighth] Amendment.\n\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976) (citation omitted).\n\n        The “deliberate indifference” standard of the Eighth Amendment governs SHP’s\nresponsibility for training and supervising its LPN nurses concerning their legal duty to honor an\ninmate’s constitutional right to adequate medical care. SHP’s failure to train and supervise its\nLPN nurses adequately “about their legal duty to avoid violating citizens’ rights may rise to the\nlevel of an official government policy for purposes of § 1983,” Connick v. Thompson, 131 S. Ct.\n1350, 1359 (2011), and constitute the moving force behind Butler’s harm. See Bd. of Cnty.\nComm’rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997); Burgess v. Fischer, 735 F.3d 462,\n478 (6th Cir. 2013) (citing Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978)). Shadrick’s\nburden under § 1983 is to prove that SHP’s failure to train and supervise its LPN nurses about\nthe legal duty to provide constitutionally adequate medical care amounted “to deliberate\nindifference to the rights of persons with whom the [nurses] come into contact.” City of Canton\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 14\n\nv. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388 (1989). The law does not permit Shadrick to hold SHP liable under\n§ 1983 on theories of vicarious liability or respondeat superior. See Rouster, 749 F.3d at 453.\n\n       Deliberate indifference “is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal\nactor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.” Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 410.\nThe standard is comprised of both objective and subjective components. Jones, 625 F.3d at 941.\nThe objective component is easily met in this case because Butler suffered from a variety of\nmedical conditions demonstrating a “sufficiently serious” medical need for treatment and care.\nSee Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994) (quoting Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298\n(1991)). Nearly all of his medical conditions had been diagnosed by his private physician as\nmandating treatment, and Butler’s need for medical care while confined at HCDC was “so\nobvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention.”\nJones, 625 F.3d at 941 (quoting Harrison v. Ash, 539 F.3d 510, 518 (6th Cir. 2008)). The deputy\njailers could tell that Butler needed prompt medical treatment even though they did not have the\nsame medical training as SHP’s nurses.\n\n       The subjective element of deliberate indifference requires proof that SHP possessed a\nculpable state of mind in failing to train and supervise LPN nurses working within the jail\nenvironment. Id. Shadrick cannot meet this requirement by showing mere negligence, Farmer,\n511 U.S. at 835, yet the bar is not so high that Shadrick must prove SHP’s actual intent to cause\nharm, as our dissenting colleague suggests. Dissent at 36 (“Deliberate indifference, unlike\nnegligence, requires intent.”) The Supreme Court has defined deliberate indifference as “lying\nsomewhere between the poles of negligence at one end and purpose or knowledge at the other”\nand it is “routinely equated . . . with recklessness.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836. Acting or failing to\nact “with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a prisoner is the\nequivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.” Id. “In other words, a plaintiff ‘does not need to\nshow that the [defendant] acted with the very purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that\nharm will result.’” Bonner-Turner v. City of Ecorse, No. 14-2337, 2015 WL 5332465, at *6 (6th\nCir. Sept. 14, 2015) (quoting Phillips v. Roane Cnty., 534 F.3d 531, 541 (6th Cir. 2008)). The\nstandard satisfies the “twin goals” of being high enough not to equate to mere negligence, but\n\fNo. 14-5603                          Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                        Page 15\n\nlow enough so that a plaintiff can avoid summary judgment in favor of the defendant without\nhaving to prove her entire case. Id.\n\n         Shadrick can thus establish an Eighth Amendment violation if she can prove that SHP\nknew of and disregarded an excessive risk to inmates’ health or safety; the proof must\ndemonstrate that SHP was “aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm” existed and that SHP drew the inference. Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n837. More specifically, Shadrick must prove that SHP’s training program and supervision were\ninadequate for the tasks the nurses were required to perform, the inadequacy resulted from SHP’s\ndeliberate indifference, and the inadequacy actually caused, or is closely related to, Butler’s\ninjury. See Plinton v. Cnty. of Summit, 540 F.3d 459, 464 (6th Cir. 2008); Russo v. City of\nCincinnati, 953 F.2d 1036, 1046 (6th Cir. 1992).6 The dissent is mistaken when it characterizes\nthe issue as whether SHP “has . . . consciously adopted a specific ‘policy’ of perpetrating\nunconstitutional conduct,” Dissent at 35; whether “SHP consciously decided to adopt a policy\nthat it knew would cause its employees to violate inmates’ constitutional rights,” id. at 36; or\nwhether “SHP consciously chose to violate inmates’ constitutional rights,” id. at 41. The central\nquestion is whether SHP’s failure to train its nurses to adhere to their legal duty to honor the\nconstitutional right of inmates to adequate medical care amounted to SHP’s deliberate\nindifference to the rights of inmates like Butler with whom SHP and its staff come into contact.\nSee City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 388.\n\n         Our analysis focuses on the adequacy of SHP’s training program, see id. at 390, which is\n“necessarily intended to apply over time to multiple employees.” Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 407.\nShadrick cannot meet her burden of proof by showing that one nurse was unsatisfactorily trained,\nthat “an otherwise sound” training program was “negligently administered,” or that harm could\nhave been avoided if the nurse had had “better or more training, sufficient to equip [her] to avoid\n\n\n         6\n           Shadrick cites Taylor v. Michigan Department of Corrections, 69 F.3d 76, 81 (6th Cir. 1995), as support\nfor her argument that SHP failed to supervise its employees. Appellant’s Br. at 32. Taylor concerned a claim of\nfailure to supervise brought against a specific jail official sued in his individual capacity. Id. In that situation, a\nplaintiff must show that the supervisor at least implicitly authorized, approved, or knowingly acquiesced in\nunconstitutional conduct of a subordinate. Id. Taylor has no application here because Shadrick contends that SHP,\na corporate entity acting under contract with Hopkins County, maintained a policy or custom of failing to train and\nsupervise its nurses. See Essex v. Cnty. of Livingston, 518 F. App’x 351, 355–56 (6th Cir. 2013) (distinguishing\nbetween individual-capacity and official-capacity failure-to-train or supervise claims).\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 16\n\nthe particular injury-causing conduct.” See City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390–91. Instead,\nShadrick can demonstrate SHP’s failure to provide LPN nurses with adequate training and\nsupervision in one of two ways. She can show “[a] pattern of similar constitutional violations by\nuntrained employees” and SHP’s “‘continued adherence to an approach that [it] knows or should\nknow has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees,” thus establishing “the conscious\ndisregard for the consequences of [its] action—the ‘deliberate indifference’—necessary to trigger\nmunicipal liability.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1360 (quoting Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 407).\nAlternatively, Shadrick can establish “a single violation of federal rights, accompanied by a\nshowing that [SHP] has failed to train its employees to handle recurring situations presenting an\nobvious potential” for a constitutional violation. Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 409. This second\nmode of proof is available “in a narrow range of circumstances” where a federal rights violation\n“may be a highly predictable consequence of a failure to equip [employees] with specific tools to\nhandle recurring situations.” Id. In such a case,\n\n       it may happen that in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees\n       the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely\n       to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers . . . can\n       reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need. In that event,\n       the failure to provide proper training may fairly be said to represent a policy for\n       which the city is responsible, and for which the city may be held liable if it\n       actually causes injury.\n\nCity of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390. As an example, “city policymakers know to a moral certainty\nthat their police officers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.” Id. at 390 n.10. Having armed\nthe police officers with guns to accomplish the task, “the need to train officers in the\nconstitutional limitations on the use of deadly force can be said to be ‘so obvious,’ that failure to\ndo so could properly be characterized as ‘deliberate indifference’ to constitutional rights.” Id.\n(internal citation omitted). This method of proof does not require Shadrick to show that SHP had\nactual or constructive notice that its nurses were deficiently trained, as asserted in the dissent;\nproof of actual or constructive notice is necessary only when a plaintiff pursues § 1983 liability\non the pattern theory of constitutional violations. See Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1360–61.\n\n       The likelihood that a particular situation will recur and the probability that an employee\nwho lacks proper tools to respond to the situation will violate a citizen’s federal rights could lead\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 17\n\nto a finding that the policymaker’s decision not to train reflects deliberate indifference “to the\nobvious consequence of the policymakers’ choice—namely, a violation of a specific\nconstitutional or statutory right.”    Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 409.         “The high degree of\npredictability may also support an inference of causation—that the municipality’s indifference\nled directly to the very consequence that was so predictable.” Id. at 409–10.\n\n       When we apply these principles and examine the facts in the light most favorable to\nShadrick, as we must in reviewing a motion for summary judgment, Cass, 770 F.3d at 373, the\nrecord reveals genuine issues of material fact that precluded a grant of summary judgment. SHP\nchose by contract to assume the county’s constitutional medical obligations to its prisoners.\nSHP’s administrators knew that the LPN nurses interacted with dozens of inmates presenting a\nwide and recurring range of medical conditions that required timely and accurate diagnosis and\ntreatment. As we explain more fully below, a reasonable jury could find that the potential risk of\nthe commission of constitutional torts by LPN nurses who lack the essential knowledge, tools,\npreparation, and authority to respond to the recurring medical needs of prisoners in the jail\nsetting is so obvious that SHP’s failure to provide adequate training and supervision to those\nnurses constitutes deliberate indifference to the risk. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836; City of\nCanton, 489 U.S. at 390.\n\n       1. The training program and supervision were inadequate\n\n       The evidence reveals that SHP did not have a training program. See Campbell, 700 F.3d\nat 794. There is no indication in the record before us that SHP designed and implemented any\ntype of ongoing training program for its LPN nurses. While the nurses may have received some\nlimited on-the-job training when beginning their employment, such as learning where supplies\nwere kept, there is no proof of a training program that was designed to guide LPN nurses in\nassessing and documenting medical conditions of inmates, obtaining physician orders, providing\nordered treatments to inmates, monitoring patient progress, or providing necessary emergency\ncare to inmates within the jail environment in order to avoid constitutional violations.\n\n       LPN nurses complete a level of medical training, they obtain a Kentucky license, and\nthey arrive on the job with a limited set of medical skills. This § 1983 claim does not turn, as the\ndissent says, on whether the nurses know how to make “rudimentary medical judgments” about\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 18\n\ninmates’ symptoms or whether they know when to call the doctor. Dissent at 39. Shadrick’s\nexpert witness established that LPN nurses lack any authority to diagnose medical conditions, yet\nthe nurses are routinely confronted with frequent and competing demands for medical care\narising from the needs of numerous inmates suffering from maladies of varying severity. It is\npredictable that placing an LPN nurse lacking the specific tools to handle the situations she will\ninevitably confront in the jail setting will lead to violation of the constitutional rights of inmates.\nA reasonable jury, therefore, could determine that SHP’s failure to train and supervise its LPN\nnurses in meeting their constitutional obligations demonstrates SHP’s own deliberate\nindifference to the highly predictable consequence that an LPN nurse will commit a\nconstitutional violation.    See Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 409.         A jury could find that “the\nunconstitutional consequences of failing to train” are “so patently obvious” that SHP should be\nheld “liable under § 1983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of violations.” Connick, 131 S.\nCt. at 1361. Even the dissent acknowledges that City of Canton applies if “the need is so patent\nas to be self-evident.” Dissent at 39.\n\n       The lack of training and supervision by SHP is clearly evidenced by the blanket inability\nof the LPN nurses who worked at HCDC to identify and discuss the requirements of SHP’s\nwritten policies governing their work. See Russo, 953 F.2d at 1046 (noting police officers were\nunable “to give specific responses as to the content of their training.”) The nurses professed\nignorance of the written medical treatment protocols and policies purportedly drafted by SHP to\nguide their conduct.        The nurses denied receiving ongoing training about their medical\nresponsibilities within the jail setting, and they disclosed that their superiors did not give\nfeedback or regular evaluations to let them know whether they performed appropriately. A\ngenuine issue of material fact exists about whether SHP required the nurses to sign documents\nattesting that they had read and understood the SHP policies and protocols. Most troubling is the\nadmission of Angela Pleasant, SHP’s on-site nursing manager at HCDC, that she was not\nfamiliar with the SHP policies she was specifically designated to enforce. Key here also is her\nopen acknowledgement that SHP nurses followed an undocumented policy and custom of\nproviding medical assistance only if an inmate asked for it, despite the existence of written\npolicies, procedures, and treatment protocols mandating that nurses take particular actions at\nparticular times.\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 19\n\n       Two high-level supervisors disclaimed any responsibility for training and supervising the\nLPN nurses. Dr. Davis denied that it was his job to train or supervise them, and Betty Dawes,\nSHP’s regional administrator, conceded that she did not offer any type of training program or\ninsure that the nurses were trained to carry out their responsibilities. Further, because she never\ncompared the SHP policies to the jail policies to find any conflicts within them, she made no\neffort to clarify the proper course of conduct for nurses in instances of policy conflict.\n\n       Shadrick traced the lack of adequate training and supervision to the top of SHP’s\norganization. President Hairsine is not college-educated or medically trained, and she could not\nexplain the differences in the permitted scope of medical practice for LPNs and RNs. Rather\nthan provide training and supervision necessary to insure that LPN nurses acted within the scope\nof practice, SHP expected the nurses to define that scope for the company. Hairsine pointed to\nthe SHP policies and treatment protocols as proof of instruction, yet she candidly admitted that\nSHP allowed LPN nurses to use the policies and protocols in their discretion, even though a\ncritical document like the MRSA policy mandated immediate implementation of a specialized\ntreatment protocol.    Shadrick’s expert witness opined that SHP failed to provide adequate\ntraining and supervision to the LPN nurses. See Russo, 953 F.2d at 1047 (“Especially in the\ncontext of a failure to train claim, expert testimony may prove the sole avenue available to\nplaintiffs to call into question the adequacy of . . . training procedures.”)\n\n       Taking this evidence in a light most favorable to Shadrick, see Cass, 770 F.3d at 373, a\nreasonable jury could find that SHP was deliberately indifferent to the need to train and\nsupervise its LPN nurses to provide adequate medical care to inmates, especially in view of the\nobvious risk that the Constitution could be violated without such training and supervision.\nSee City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390. As the party moving for summary judgment, SHP did not\nsatisfy its initial burden to show the lack of genuine issues of material fact in dispute, Celotex\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986), and Shadrick, the non-moving party, produced\nsufficient evidence “on which the jury could reasonably find” that SHP inadequately trained and\nsupervised its LPN nurses, see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986);\nPlinton, 540 F.3d at 464 (observing plaintiff demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact on the\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 20\n\n“inadequacy-of-training prong of City of Canton); Russo, 953 F.2d at 1047. On this record, the\ngrant of summary judgment to SHP was inappropriate.\n\n       Neither the Supreme Court’s decision in Connick nor this court’s decision in D’Ambrosio\nv. Marino, 747 F.3d 378 (6th Cir. 2014), compel a different result.            Both Connick and\nD’Ambrosio involved § 1983 claims brought against prosecutors who failed to turn over\nexculpatory evidence to defendants as required by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\nConnick, 131 S. Ct. at 1355–56; D’Ambrosio, 747 F.3d at 382. In Connick, the Supreme Court\nrecognized that City of Canton “left open the possibility” that “a pattern of similar constitutional\nviolations might not be necessary to show deliberate indifference,” but concluded that a district\nattorney’s failure to train his prosecutors “in their Brady obligations does not fall within the\nnarrow range of Canton’s hypothesized single-incident liability.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1361.\nThe Court reasoned that “[a]ttorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to\ninterpret and apply legal principles, understand constitutional limits, and exercise legal\njudgment.” Id. By contrast, there was “no reason to assume that police academy applicants are\nfamiliar with the constitutional constraints on the use of deadly force. And, in the absence of\ntraining, there is no way for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they require. Under\nthose circumstances there is an obvious need for some form of training.” Id. The Court offered\nfurther contrast by noting that the City of Canton “hypothetical assume[d] that the armed police\nofficers ha[d] no knowledge at all of the constitutional limits on the use of deadly force,” while\nin Connick it was undisputed “that the prosecutors . . . were familiar with the general Brady\nrule.” Id. at 1363. See also D’Ambrosio, 747 F.3d at 386–89 (following Connick to affirm\ndismissal of § 1983 complaint brought by exonerated death row inmate against prosecutor who\nviolated Brady obligations).\n\n       This case mirrors the example given in City of Canton. The obvious need to train police\nofficers who lack knowledge of the constitutional constraints on the use of deadly force parallels\nthe obvious need to train LPN nurses who lack knowledge about the constitutional dimensions of\nproviding adequate medical care to inmates in the jail setting. Unlike licensed prosecutors who\ncompleted law school, routinely attend ongoing continuing legal education classes, receive on-\nthe-job legal mentoring, and labor under rules of professional responsibility to master their Brady\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 21\n\nobligations, Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1361–62, LPN nurses employed within the prison\nenvironment may be required to make professional judgments outside their area of medical\nexpertise. Unless the employer provides necessary training, the LPN nurses lack knowledge\nabout the constitutional consequences of their actions or inaction in providing medical care to\ninmates. Because it is so highly predictable that a poorly trained LPN nurse working in the jail\nsetting “utter[ly] lack[s] an ability to cope with constitutional situations,” id. at 1363, a jury\nreasonably could find that SHP’s failure to train reflects “deliberate indifference to the ‘highly\npredictable consequence,’ namely, violations of constitutional rights,” id. at 1361 (quoting Bryan\nCnty., 520 U.S. at 409). Unlike Connick and D’Ambrosio, this case falls squarely within “the\nnarrow range of Canton’s hypothesized single-incident liability.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1361.\n\n       2. The inadequacy of training resulted from SHP’s deliberate indifference\n\n       Shadrick’s evidence demonstrates that SHP’s inadequate training and supervision of its\nLPN nurses resulted from its own deliberate indifference to the rights of inmates with whom the\nnurses came into contact. See id. at 1360; City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 388. As we explained\nabove, none of the administrators within SHP’s organizational hierarchy—President Hairsine,\nRegional Administrator Dawes, Nurse Manager Pleasant, or the Medical Director, Dr. Davis—\ntook responsibility to train LPN nurses at HCDC or to provide them with appropriate supervisory\noversight to avoid violation of the constitutional rights of confined inmates to adequate medical\ntreatment for their serious medical needs. See City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 388. President\nHairsine’s failure to enforce SHP policies and treatment protocols produced LPN nurses who\nwere ignorant of the constitutional standards governing their medical practice in the jail setting.\nAs a result, the nurses engaged in a custom and practice of requiring seriously ill inmates to\nrequest medical care before any services would be provided, even if the circumstances called for\nemergency medical treatment.\n\n       Evidence concerning the conduct of SHP after Butler’s death further confirms the\ncompany’s deliberate indifference. When Jailer Blue called President Hairsine to HCDC after\nButler’s death, she visited for less than two hours and pronounced “everything was fine.” There\nis no proof that Hairsine, Watts, Dawes, Pleasant, or any other SHP manager investigated\nwhether Butler’s death was related to the adequacy of medical care SHP nurses provided or\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 22\n\nfailed to provide. Nurses Keller and Johnson both testified that no one from SHP contacted them\nabout Butler’s death. Nurse Pleasant stated that neither she nor any other staff member was\ncounseled or disciplined by an SHP administrator following Butler’s death. RN Dawes conceded\nthat the LPN nurses assigned to HCDC did not follow SHP’s policies and procedures in caring\nfor Butler, that the nurses failed to meet the medical standard of care, and that the nurses failed to\nfollow documentation guidelines. But Dawes made no attempt to train the nurses before or after\nButler died, and she offered only a belated “support visit” to the staff following Butler’s death.\nIn the opinion of Shadrick’s expert witness, SHP’s business model by its nature creates\nsubstantial deficiencies in the provision of adequate health care services to inmates.\n\n       The conduct of SHP staff both before and after Butler’s death is relevant to whether\nSHP’s failure to train and supervise its LPN nurses reflected a deliberate or conscious choice for\nwhich SHP may be held liable under § 1983. See City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 389. Because the\ndecisions of President Hairsine represent SHP’s official policy, moreover, a jury could find that\nher deliberate indifference is equivalent to SHP’s deliberate indifference. See Pembaur v. City of\nCincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480–81, 483–84 (1986).\n\n       There is simply no evidence in this record that SHP took any steps to train and supervise\nits LPN nurses concerning the constitutional dimensions of care in a prison environment.\nBecause a jury reasonably could find that the inadequacy in the training program resulted\ndirectly from SHP’s deliberate indifference, SHP is not entitled to summary judgment on this\nelement of the claim.\n\n       3. The inadequacy in training actually caused, or is closely related to, Butler’s injury\n\n       Reasonable jurors could further determine that SHP’s inadequate training and supervision\nactually caused, or was closely related to, Butler’s injury and death. See Plinton, 540 F.3d at\n464. Butler was a sick man when he reported for admission to HCDC. The deputy jailers did\nnot want to admit him, but they deferred to Candace Moss, SHP’s visiting LPN, who was the\nonly medical staff person on duty and the only one with authority to decide whether to admit\nButler to the jail. Moss admitted Butler to the jail without conducting a medical examination and\ndid not call Dr. Davis for treatment orders. Nurses Johnson, Moss, and Keller each failed to\nassess Butler’s medical condition and seek physician orders during the following 72 hours. At\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 23\n\nbest, the evidence shows that Butler received three blood pressure checks and five prescription\ntablets, none of which constituted necessary and prompt treatment for the staph or MRSA\ninfection that ultimately led to sepsis and Butler’s death. Grossly inadequate medical care may\nestablish deliberate indifference. See Terrance v. Northville Reg’l Psychiatric Hosp., 286 F.3d\n834, 843 (6th Cir. 2002).\n\n       The undisputed facts establish that Butler’s urgent need for medical treatment was\napparent the moment he walked through HCDC’s door, yet SHP staff did not provide it in spite\nof Butler’s requests for help and the urging of jail deputies to attend to Butler. Not only were the\nSHP nurses aware of facts alerting them that Butler faced a substantial risk of serious harm if he\ndid not receive timely and proper medical care, there is evidence they actually drew the inference\nof a substantial risk of serious harm and recklessly disregarded it. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835\n(“[A]cting or failing to act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a\nprisoner is the equivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.”) The lack of evidence that SHP\ntrained and supervised its nurses in their constitutional obligations to provide medical care could\nlead a reasonable jury to find that SHP was deliberately indifferent to the inmates with whom the\nnurses came into contact and that SHP’s failure to train and supervise the nurses actually caused,\nor was closely related to, Butler’s death. See Plinton, 540 F.3d at 464.\n\n       Shadrick produced sufficient evidence to create genuine issues of material fact for trial on\nall three elements of her § 1983 claim against SHP for failure to train and supervise the LPN\nnurses. She met SHP’s summary judgment motion with evidence that SHP’s training program is\ninadequate for the tasks the LPN nurses are required to perform, that the inadequacy resulted\nfrom SHP’s deliberate indifference, and that the inadequacy actually caused, or was closely\nrelated to, Butler’s injury. Summary judgment on the § 1983 claim was unwarranted, thus\nrequiring us to reverse and remand the case for further proceedings on this claim.\n\n       Although we do not address Shadrick’s argument that a pattern of tortious or\nunconstitutional conduct by inadequately trained nurses existed, see Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at\n407–08; Burgess, 735 F.3d at 478, evidence about similar incidents of inmate deaths in jail\nfacilities served by SHP may be relevant to whether SHP acted with deliberate indifference to\nthe medical needs of inmates with whom its nurses came into contact at HCDC. This is a trial\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 24\n\nissue for the district court to resolve on remand. We do not address Shadrick’s contention that\nSHP management ratified the conduct of its nurses.\n\nB. Negligence and immunity under Kentucky law\n\n       Shadrick next challenges the district court’s ruling that SHP is protected by qualified\nofficial immunity from the negligence claim brought against it. Because qualified official\nimmunity does not apply to SHP, a corporate entity, and because SHP is not entitled to\ngovernmental immunity as the agent or alter ego of Hopkins County, we reverse the grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of SHP on the negligence claim.\n\n       Sovereign immunity has long protected the Commonwealth of Kentucky from suit,\nComair, Inc. v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cnty Airport Corp., 295 S.W.3d 91, 94 (Ky. 2009), and\n“[c]ounties, which predate the existence of the state and are considered direct political\nsubdivisions of it, enjoy the same sovereign immunity as the state itself. Id.; Lexington-Fayette\nUrban Cnty. Gov’t v. Smolcic, 142 S.W.3d 128, 132 (Ky. 2004); Schwindel v. Meade Cnty.,\n113 S.W.3d 159, 163 (Ky. 2003). State or county agencies, however, are protected only by\ngovernmental immunity, “a policy-derived offshoot of sovereign immunity.”                 Caneyville\nVolunteer Fire Dep’t v. Green’s Motorcycle Salvage, Inc., 286 S.W.3d 790, 801 (Ky. 2009);\nYanero v. Davis, 65 S.W.3d 510, 519 (Ky. 2001).             Under the doctrine of governmental\nimmunity, a state or county agency or entity is immune from tort liability if it performs “a\ngovernmental, as opposed to a proprietary, function.” Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 519.\n\n       In providing medical services to incarcerated inmates, SHP claims to act as an arm,\nagent, or alter ego of Hopkins County. To determine whether SHP is entitled to share the\ncounty’s governmental immunity, we apply the test announced by the Kentucky Supreme Court\nin Comair: The immunity inquiry turns on the source of the entity and “the nature of the\nfunction it carries out.” Comair, Inc., 295 S.W.3d at 99; Coppage Constr. Co. v. Sanitation Dist.\nNo. 1, 459 S.W.3d 855, 859 (Ky. 2015). The origin of the entity—whether it was created by the\nstate, the county, or a city—is important because the entity’s immunity status depends to some\nextent on whether the parent entity is immune. Comair, Inc., 295 S.W.3d at 99. The second part\nof the test—the nature of the function carried out—must focus “on state level governmental\nconcerns that are common to all of the citizens” of the state, such as the corrections system. Id.\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..             Page 25\n\n       When we apply both components of the Comair test, we conclude that SHP is not entitled\nto share the county’s governmental immunity.          Although SHP performed a governmental\nfunction in providing medical care to county inmates, SHP cannot demonstrate that its origin\nderived from Hopkins County. In response to SHP’s manifest inability to meet the origin\nrequirement, the dissent blends the first part of the Comair test into the second, rendering the\norigin requirement superfluous. Dissent at 44 (“But if the source and nature of the function is\notherwise clear . . . there is no need to retrace the entity’s genesis”) (emphasis added). But the\nKentucky Supreme Court instructs us to analyze both parts of the Comair test and we do so here.\n\n       SHP clearly satisfies the second part of the Comair test because SHP, by contract, was\ncharged with performing Hopkins County’s traditional governmental function of providing\nmedical services to inmates held at HCDC, which is part of a larger state-wide corrections\nsystem. Hopkins County is required by state statute to “prescribe rules for the government,\nsecurity, safety, and cleanliness of the jail and the comfort and treatment of prisoners,” and it\nmust also bear the costs of “providing necessary medical, dental, and psychological care for\nindigent prisoners in the jail.” Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 441.045(1) & (3) (West 2015). Kentucky\nadministrative regulations, however, do not place the burden to provide direct inmate medical\ncare on the counties themselves. Instead, “[t]he jail’s medical services shall be provided by\ncontracting with a health care provider licensed in Kentucky.” 501 Ky. Admin. Regs. 3:090\n(2015) (emphasis added). In conformity with this state regulation, Hopkins County contracted\nwith SHP to provide necessary medical services to inmates incarcerated at HCDC. Hopkins\nCounty retained no control over the manner or means by which SHP provided the contracted\nmedical services because the regulation explicitly states that the county’s Jailer may not restrict\nthe health care staff in the performance of medical duties except to require the medical staff to\nadhere to the jail’s security requirements. Id.      All medical procedures are required to be\nperformed “according to orders issued by the responsible medical authority.” Id. Because SHP\nfulfilled a governmental function of providing medical care to inmates by contract with Hopkins\nCounty, the second part of the Comair test is satisfied.\n\n       SHP, however, cannot meet the first part of the Comair test, which focuses on the origin\nof the entity claiming to be an arm, agent, or alter ego of a county in order to share in its\n\fNo. 14-5603                       Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..            Page 26\n\nimmunity.     Comair, Inc., 295 S.W.3d at 99.          Hopkins County did not create SHP as a\ngovernmental agency, nor did it designate SHP as the county’s agent or alter ego. Instead,\nprivate individuals formed SHP as a for-profit corporation under Delaware law. SHP is managed\nby a private corporate hierarchy and exists to provide medical services to dozens of prison\nfacilities in multiple jurisdictions.\n\n        Hopkins County did not exercise control over SHP because at all times SHP conducted\nitself as an independent contractor of the county. This is expressly addressed in the parties’\nwritten agreement. In Section 9.1 of the contract, the parties created the boundaries of their\nbusiness relationship: “The parties acknowledge that SHP is an independent contractor engaged\nto provide medical care to inmates at the Jail under the direction of SHP management. Nothing\nin this Agreement is intended nor shall be construed to create an agency relationship, an\nemployer/employee relationship, or a joint venture relationship between the parties.” R. 77-26,\nPage ID 1309 (emphasis added). In addition, SHP agreed in section 8.3 “to indemnify and hold\nharmless the County, its agents, servants and employees from any and all claims, actions,\nlawsuits, damages, judgments or liabilities of any kind whatsoever arising out of the operation\nand maintenance of the aforesaid program of health care services conducted by SHP, it being the\nexpress understanding of the parties hereto that SHP shall provide the actual health care\nservices.” Id.\n\n        SHP thus contracted to perform a governmental function, but it may not partake of the\ncounty’s sovereign immunity because it did not derive its existence and status from Hopkins\nCounty. See Comair, 295 S.W.3d at 99. Having failed to satisfy both components of the Comair\ntest, SHP is not entitled to governmental immunity.           Id.   See also Coppage Constr. Co.,\n459 S.W.3d at 860–64 (denying immunity to a sanitation district formed by communities in\nnorthern Kentucky because the district was not an arm or alter ego of the counties exercising\nsubstantial control over the district nor did it perform a function critical to Kentucky’s\ninfrastructure); Transit Auth. of River City v. Bibelhauser, 432 S.W.3d 171, 174 (Ky. Ct. App.\n2013) (holding transportation entity met first prong of Comair test, but failed to show it carried\nout a function integral to state government).\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..             Page 27\n\n       A recent case decided by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky analyzing and applying the\nComair test supports our analysis. Kentucky River Foothills Dev. Council, Inc. v. Phirman, No.\n2013-CA-001858, 2015 WL 1746483 (Ky. Ct. App. April 17, 2015). We review the case in\nsome detail because its reasoning is instructive here.\n\n       Kentucky River Foothills Development Council was incorporated under Kentucky law as\na private nonprofit corporation in 1962. Id. at *1. Kentucky River was designated under federal\nlaw to serve as a community action agency to combat poverty in four Kentucky counties. Id. at\n*1–2. Congress later repealed statutes governing community action agencies and established the\nCommunity Services Block Grant Program, which transferred responsibility for running the\nprogram from the federal government to the states. Id. at *3. The federal government issued\nblock grants to the states and charged the states with distributing the funds to eligible entities.\nId.   In response, Kentucky enacted a set of statutes to govern the establishment and\nadministration of community action agencies.         Id. at *3–4.    Political subdivisions of the\nCommonwealth could designate themselves as community action agencies or designate eligible\nprivate nonprofit corporations as the community action agencies. Id. at *4. The day-to-day\nactivities of a community action agency were not regulated by statute, and the agency was not\nlimited to administering programs funded solely from state and federal grants. Id. at *5. The\nstate, however, exercised substantial administrative oversight of the community action agency by\nmonitoring and evaluating its compliance with state and federal statutes and administrative\nregulations. Id.\n\n       Applying the Comair test, the Court of Appeals agreed with Kentucky River “that\nproviding services to the poor at the county level has historically been treated as an integral\ngovernment function,” but determined that alone was insufficient to cloak Kentucky River with\ngovernmental immunity. Id. at *6–7. Numerous factors impact the pertinent analysis:\n\n                As recognized in Caneyville, while Kentucky places the most weight on\n       the governmental function element, other factors should also be considered in\n       particularly close cases. These could include: (1) whether state statutes and case\n       law tend to characterize the entity as an arm of the state; (2) whether state\n       resources may be required in satisfying adverse judgments against the entity;\n       (3) whether the state has a financial or otherwise relevant beneficial interest in\n       litigation affecting the entity; (4) how the entity is funded; (5) its level of\n       autonomy; (6) whether the entity deals with primarily local or statewide\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 28\n\n       problems; (7) how state law/courts treat the entity; (8) the ability of the entity to\n       sue and be sued in its own name; (9) whether the entity holds and uses property;\n       (10) whether the entity can take or sell property; (11) the independent\n       management authority of the entity; (12) whether the entity performs\n       governmental or proprietary functions; (13) the entity’s corporate status; and\n       (14) whether the entity’s property is subject to state taxation.\n\nId. at *7. The existence of these many factors “is why it is particularly important to consider the\nfirst prong of the Comair test, whether the entity was established by the government, in tandem\nwith the governmental function prong.” Id. Careful examination of how the entity was created\nand whether it is the offspring of a parental entity immune from suit will necessarily require\nconsideration of the Caneyville factors, “such as how the state statute characterizes the entity, the\nextent by which the state controls the entity and its property, and whether, and to what extent, the\nentity functions apart from the state.” Id.\n\n       The Court of Appeals concluded that Kentucky River “was not created by or at the behest\nof the state or any county of the state.” Id. Instead, Kentucky River is a nonprofit corporation,\nformed by private citizens, which maintains an existence and administers programs\nindependently of the Commonwealth or its counties. Id. Designation of Kentucky River as a\ncommunity action agency “did not vest the Commonwealth with any interest in Kentucky\nRiver’s real or personal property”; “the Commonwealth did not take control of Kentucky River’s\nday-to-day operations or have direct oversight in the administration of programs funded\nseparate[ly] from the block grants”; and “Kentucky River remained free to serve other interests\noutside the scope of its designation as a community action agency.” Id. at *9. The Court of\nAppeals rejected Kentucky River’s argument that the county’s decision to designate it as a\ncommunity action agency “transformed Kentucky River into a government created agency.” Id.\nat *8. Designation of status as a community action agency did not mean that the nonprofit\norganization became “a creature of the state or the county”; rather, the organization continued to\noperate independently as a nonprofit corporation outside the scope of any state and county\noversight connected to its designation as a community action agency.               Id.    The court\ndistinguished Kentucky River’s situation from that in Autry v. Western Kentucky University,\n219 S.W.3d 713, 718 (Ky. 2007), where a state university formed a nonprofit entity for a specific\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 29\n\nand limited purpose, the nonprofit corporation existed only to serve the university, and the\nnonprofit corporation derived its immunity status through the university. Id.\n\n       At bottom, the Court of Appeals concluded, “[t]he receipt of money from the government\nto further a cause important to government should not transform an otherwise private entity into\na governmentally immune agency.” Id. at *9. “A line must be drawn somewhere before the\nconcept of governmental immunity is expanded far beyond any reasonable parameter.” Id.\nAlthough in Kentucky River the Court of Appeals denied governmental immunity to a private,\nnonprofit corporation, its reasoning applies equally to private, for-profit corporations.\n\n       Like Kentucky River, SHP “was not established by the government for its benefit.”\nSee id. SHP was not even subject to the same level of governmental control and oversight that\nKentucky River experienced. SHP was established as a private for-profit corporation long before\nHopkins County designated it as an independent contractor to provide medical services to\ninmates housed at HCDC. See id. State statutes do not characterize SHP as an arm of the state\nand neither does Kentucky case law. In a recent whistleblower suit brought against SHP by\nsome of its employees, the Court of Appeals held that SHP was not a political subdivision of the\nstate because there was little evidence that Campbell County had any control over the specific,\nday-to-day aspects of SHP’s work providing medical services to inmates. See White v. Southern\nHealth Partners, Inc., Nos. 2012-CA-001092, 2012-CA-001106, 2013 WL 2659897 (Ky. Ct.\nApp. June 14, 2013) (unpublished). As in White, SHP here retained full autonomy to decide the\nnature and extent of medical services to be supplied to Hopkins County inmates. The contract\nbetween Hopkins County and SHP expressly provided that no county resources would be\nrequired to satisfy adverse judgments for tort liability because SHP agreed to indemnify Hopkins\nCounty.    SHP maintains independent management and funds itself through profit-making\nenterprise extending beyond its relationship with Hopkins County. The company holds and\ndisposes of its own property and retains the ability to sue and be sued in its own name. SHP\ncontinues to exist as a for-profit corporation long after its contract with Hopkins County ended.\nSee Kentucky River Foothills Dev. Council, 2015 WL 1746483 at *7.\n\n       Like Kentucky River, SHP is not entitled to governmental immunity.

Westerfield, 26 S.W.2d 557, 559 (Ky. Ct. App.\n1930).\n\n         Other courts have likewise declined to extend immunity to private, for-profit corporations\ncharged with providing medical services under contracts with governmental entities.            For\nexample, a federal district court in Mississippi ruled that Wexford Health Sources, Inc., a for-\nprofit Florida corporation operating as an independent contractor to provide health care to\ninmates in Mississippi prisons, was not entitled to tort immunity despite the degree of control\nexercised over Wexford by the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Estate of Cheney ex rel.\nCheney v. Collier, No. 4:02cv111, 2012 WL 2403486, at *2–8 (N.D. Miss. June 25, 2012).\nApplying many of the same factors as Kentucky River, the district court held that Wexford did\nnot operate as a political subdivision of the state and was not entitled to share its immunity. Id.\nat *6–8. In a state case answering a certified question from a federal district court, the Oklahoma\nSupreme Court ruled that a private corporation providing emergency medical services under a\ncontract with a public trust established for that purpose is not entitled to governmental immunity\nfor negligent acts. Sullins v. Am. Med. Response of Oklahoma, Inc., 23 P.3d 259, 264 (Okla.\n2001). These cases, although not controlling in our court, nonetheless support our analysis.\n\n         The district court below erred by extending qualified official immunity to SHP.\nQualified official immunity protects individual public officials or employees who are sued in tort\nfor their good-faith discretionary acts undertaken within the scope of their employment. Jones v.\nCross, 260 S.W.3d 343, 345 & n.1 (Ky. 2008); Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 521; Rivera v. Lankford,\nNos. 2012-CA-2057, 2058, 2059, 2097, 2123, 2162, 2216, 2217, 2014 WL 2536914, *8–9 (Ky.\nCt. App. June 6, 2014); Jerauld v. Kroger, 353 S.W.3d 636, 639–40 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).\nQualified official immunity should not be confused with governmental immunity, which applies\nto government agencies and entities, not to individuals. See Furtula v. Univ. of Ky., 438 S.W.3d\n303, 305 n.1 (Ky. 2014); Caneyville Volunteer Fire Dep’t, 286 S.W.3d at 801; Kentucky River\nFoothills Dev. Council, 2015 WL 1746483, at *2. Because SHP is a corporate entity sued in its\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..             Page 31\n\nofficial capacity, only governmental immunity could possibly apply, and we have already\nexplained why SHP is not entitled to governmental immunity.\n\n       The dissent desires to extend qualified official immunity to SHP by applying Jerauld,\n353 S.W.3d 636, a case involving a negligence claim brought against a psychologist in his\nindividual capacity. Following that path would obliterate the distinction between governmental\nimmunity and qualified official immunity that the Kentucky appellate courts have fully\narticulated in their cases. Litigants and courts would be disserved by sowing seeds of confusion\nin this complex field of state immunity law that has “vexed the courts of the Commonwealth for\ndecades.” Coppage Constr. Co., 459 S.W.3d at 859. In Coppage, Comair, Caneyville, Furtula,\nJones, and Yanero, the Kentucky Supreme Court has provided guidance for distinguishing\namong the various types of immunity and to aid resolution of difficult questions of state\nimmunity law. We are not free to disregard or rewrite Kentucky law, see Erie R.R. Co. v.\nTompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 79–80 (1938); instead, we are bound to follow the immunity precepts\ndefined by the Kentucky courts in their interpretation of their own state law. See Felder v.\nCasey, 487 U.S. 131, 151 (1988) (“federal courts are constitutionally obligated to apply state law\nto state claims”). Furthermore, extending immunity to SHP as the county’s agent responsible for\nproviding medical care to inmates, as the dissent proposes, would impair the parties’ written\ncontract declaring that “[n]othing in this Agreement is intended nor shall be construed to create\nan agency relationship.” R. 77-26, Page ID 1309.\n\n       Finally, SHP and the dissent rely on Autry v. Western Kentucky University, but that case\nis readily distinguishable for the reasons set forth by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in\nKentucky River, 2015 WL 1746483, at *8. Western Kentucky University, a state agency, created\nthe non-profit Student Life Foundation (SLF) to hold title to dormitory properties. Autry,\n219 S.W.3d at 718.     The university transferred title to SLF, which in turn entered into a\nmanagement agreement with the university providing that the university would operate the\ndormitories, collect rent, and hire and supervise staff. Id. A wrongful death action was brought\nagainst the university, SLF, and several individual defendants in their official and individual\ncapacities. Id. at 716. The Kentucky Supreme Court concluded that the university was fulfilling\nits statutory duty by managing the dorms and was entitled to governmental immunity. Id. at 718.\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..             Page 32\n\nSLF, formed by the university for a specific and limited purpose, existed only to serve the\nuniversity’s needs and acted as its alter ego. Id. at 718–19. Because “SLF has no truly\nindependent existence from” the university, delegating dorm management to the university was\n“tantamount to [the university] delegating to itself.” Id. at 719. Therefore, SLF shared the\nimmunity of the state agency, the university. Id.\n\n       In this case, by contrast, Hopkins County did not create SHP, nor was SHP the alter ego\nof Hopkins County, nor did SHP exist solely to serve Hopkins County. As the Kentucky Court\nof Appeals did in Kentucky River, we distinguish Autry on this basis.\n\n       We acknowledge a troublesome paragraph at the end of Autry which notes that “SLF was\nsued directly, on the assumption that it is not a governmental entity at all. This amounts to suing\nSLF in its individual capacity. In that capacity, SLF is entitled to qualified official immunity,\ndepending upon whether its delegation of management . . . was a discretionary or a ministerial\nfunction.” Id. The opinion then relies on Yanero, a case applying qualified official immunity to\nindividual persons, to support a statement that SLF engaged in discretionary acts and was\nentitled to qualified official immunity in its individual capacity. Id.\n\n       We think this paragraph is dicta and incorrectly applies to a corporate entity the concept\nof qualified official immunity that is meant to protect individual persons from suit in their\nindividual capacities, thereby blurring a distinction in immunity law that Kentucky courts\nordinarily draw with precision. See e.g., Furtula, 438 S.W.3d at 305 n.1; Caneyville Volunteer\nFire Dep’t, 286 S.W.3d at 801; Jones, 260 S.W.3d at 345 & n.1; Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 521;\nRivera, 2014 WL 2536914, *8–9; and Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d at 639–40.                For instance, in\nLouisville Arena Authority, Inc. v. Ram Engineering & Construction, Inc., 415 S.W.3d 671, (Ky.\nCt. App. 2013), the Court of Appeals prefaced its discussion of sovereign and governmental\nimmunity “with the clarification that no official or employee of the Finance Cabinet has been\nnamed in an individual capacity. Consequently, we are not concerned with qualified official\nimmunity and the distinctions between ministerial and discretionary functions.” We are likewise\nconcerned here only with governmental immunity because no official or employee of SHP is\nbefore us in this appeal. We therefore find the last paragraph of Autry inapposite. After careful\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..            Page 33\n\nstudy of the Kentucky cases, we conclude that SHP is not entitled to governmental immunity on\nthe negligence claim brought against it.\n\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       SHP has not demonstrated its entitlement to summary judgment on the § 1983 claim for\nfailure to train or supervise its LPN nurses, and SHP is not entitled to governmental immunity on\nthe negligence claim. Accordingly, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment in favor of\nSHP and we REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..

I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the summary\njudgment granted in favor of defendant Southern Health Partners, Inc. (SHP) on both claims.\n\n       Regarding plaintiff Shadrick’s § 1983 claim, the majority opinion acknowledges that\nSHP maintained a policy requiring its LPNs to monitor and treat Tyler Butler’s staph infection\nunder the guidance of its medical director, a licensed physician. Still, it concludes that the LPN\ntraining program posed so “obvious” a risk to Butler’s rights that SHP can be held liable\n“without proof of a pre-existing pattern of [constitutional] violations.” Connick v. Thompson,\n131 S. Ct. 1350, 1361 (2011). In so holding, the majority expands the theory of “single-\nincident” liability beyond the narrow circumstances contemplated in City of Canton v. Harris,\n489 U.S. 378 (1989), and Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1361–63.\n\n       With respect to plaintiff’s state-law negligence claim, my colleagues take the opposite\napproach, limiting the availability of qualified official immunity in ways not recognized under\nKentucky law. But precedent on this issue is clear: private entities that contract with a Kentucky\ncounty to provide medical services to county jail inmates—like SHP—are eligible for qualified\nofficial immunity irrespective of their business form or origin. See Jerauld ex rel. Robinson v.\nKroger, 353 S.W.3d 636, 641 (Ky. Ct. App. 2011); see also Autry v. W. Ky. Univ., 219 S.W.3d\n713, 719 (Ky. 2007).\n\n                                                I.\n\n       The first issue is whether the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor\nof SHP on Shadrick’s § 1983 claim. The parties, my colleagues, and I agree that Shadrick’s\nclaim against SHP is controlled by Monell v. New York City Department of Social Services,\n436 U.S. 658 (1978).\n\n       As we have repeatedly cautioned in the context of Monell claims, courts must resist the\ntemptation to impose vicarious liability upon entities like SHP for the egregious conduct of their\nemployees. Under Monell, governmental actors “are responsible only for their own illegal acts.\n\fNo. 14-5603                        Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..            Page 35\n\nThey are not vicariously liable under § 1983 for their employees’ actions.” D’Ambrosio v.\nMarino, 747 F.3d 378, 386 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 758 (2014). Furthermore, the\ndispositive question regarding SHP’s liability is whether “the challenged conduct occur[red]\npursuant to [SHP’s] ‘official policy,’ such that [SHP’s] promulgation or adoption of the policy\ncan be said to have ‘cause[d]’ one of its employees to violate the plaintiff’s constitutional rights.”\nId. (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 692). In other words, SHP “is liable under § 1983 only where,\n‘through its deliberate conduct,’ it was ‘the moving force behind the injury alleged.’” Id. at 389\n(quoting Alman v. Reed, 703 F.3d 887, 903 (6th Cir. 2013)).\n\n        Because the focus must be on SHP’s own decisions rather than those of its employees,\nSHP can be found liable only if it has (1) consciously adopted a specific “policy” of perpetrating\nunconstitutional conduct despite (2) having actual or constructive notice that the policy will\ncause employees to violate constitutional rights, such that SHP can be considered “deliberately\nindifferent” to the fact that its employees will spread constitutional harm. Connick, 131 S. Ct. at\n1359–60.\n\n        Given that Monell liability presupposes a conscious adoption of a course of action “from\namong various alternatives,” City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823 (1985), a\ngovernment entity’s “culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most tenuous where a claim\nturns on a failure to train.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359. After all, “[i]n virtually every instance\nwhere a person has had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city employee, a § 1983\nplaintiff will be able to point to something the city ‘could have done’ to prevent the unfortunate\nincident.” Id. at 1363 (citation omitted). If an employee acts in a particularly egregious manner,\nit may be tempting to collapse the Monell analysis into a respondeat superior test and to blame\nthe wrongdoer’s employer for failing to ensure that she would do a better job. See id. at 1365\n& n.12. This is the mistake Shadrick makes, claiming that “SHP’s LPNs’ responsibilities were\nso obvious, their violations of SHP’s policies so multitudinous, and their ignorance of Mr.\nButler’s condition so glaring, that SHP must be held responsible.” (Opening Br. at 30; see also\nid. at 31–32 (“The fact that SHP’s nurses violated virtually every provision of SHP’s policies\nbearing on Mr. Butler’s care and treatment speaks to their lack of training, SHP’s indifference,\nand its resultant liability.”)).\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 36\n\n       But as the Supreme Court recently reiterated, an essential characteristic of a failure-to-\ntrain claim is that it requires more than merely substandard training. A plaintiff must show that\nthe government entity’s failure to train its employees in relevant respects is not merely a\nnegligent omission; it must amount to a conscious “decision not to train certain employees about\ntheir legal duty to avoid violating citizens’ rights.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359. “‘[D]eliberate\nindifference’ is a stringent standard of fault”; Monell liability applies only when a state actor has\nitself decided to violate the Constitution by retaining a defective training program that it\nconstructively or actually knows causes employees to violate citizens’ constitutional rights. Id.\nat 1360 (quoting Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 410 (1997)).\n\n       In the present case, it certainly appears that one or more of SHP’s employees was\nnegligent in following SHP’s policies and providing Butler with appropriate care—with\ncatastrophic results. But the fact that SHP’s training of these particular personnel may have been\ninadequate does not itself establish that SHP was deliberately indifferent to inmates’\nconstitutional rights. Deliberate indifference, unlike negligence, requires intent. It is not enough\nto demonstrate only that SHP’s training regimen did not comport with best practices; Shadrick\nmust establish that SHP was on notice that its training program was constitutionally deficient but\nconsciously decided not to correct it.\n\n       The evidence submitted by Shadrick does not create a jury question regarding whether\nSHP consciously decided to adopt a policy that it knew would cause its employees to violate\ninmates’ constitutional rights. It is undisputed that SHP promulgated policies guiding its nurses’\nconduct in providing health care to inmates, required its nurses to read and sign its policies,\nprovided on-the-job training to its nurses, and held routine monthly meetings with its nurses to\nreview the policies and any updates to them. SHP’s policies specifically required nurses to\nexamine inmates presenting symptoms of drug or alcohol use or staph infections and to notify\nand seek treatment authority and review from the facility’s medical director. In fact, Shadrick\nargued in the district court (and on appeal) that the individual nurses were liable because of their\nfailure to abide by SHP’s extant policies. In other words, Shadrick’s claim against the nurses\nhinges partially on her theory that Butler’s death would have been averted had the nurses\nfollowed the SHP policies upon which they had been trained. The majority is apparently swayed\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 37\n\nby this argument, citing multiple instances in which SHP’s employees failed to follow, or\nappeared unfamiliar with, the company’s polices. But if the underlying harm was caused by\nemployees’ deviation from SHP’s policies, then Monell liability cannot lie: the harm is the fault\nof the individual employees and is not attributable to the governmental entity that employed\nthem.\n\n        Despite the fact that SHP trained its nurses on applicable policies that—if followed—\nwould have prevented the harm suffered in this case, Shadrick contends that SHP should have\ntrained them more extensively. Specifically, she asserts that SHP should have trained its LPNs\nthat they could not “treat[ ] conditions outside their scope of practice and without notifying or\nconsulting SHP’s contract physician.”\n\n        “Without notice that a course of training is deficient in a particular respect,\ndecisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause\nviolations of constitutional rights.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1360. Thus, Shadrick’s claim turns on\nwhether a reasonable jury could find that SHP had actual or constructive notice that its nurses\nwere deficiently trained in violation of the Constitution, despite its policies. Id. On the evidence\nShadrick provided, I submit that it could not.\n\n        “[O]rdinarily,” plaintiffs must demonstrate notice by pointing to a prior pattern of similar\nconstitutional violations by inadequately trained employees. Id. This is because, “[u]ntil the\n[government entity] had notice of persistent misconduct, it did not have ‘the opportunity to\nconform to constitutional dictates,’ nor could its inaction have caused the deprivation of [the\nplaintiff’s] constitutional rights.” D’Ambrosio, 747 F.3d at 388 (quoting Connick, 131 S. Ct. at\n1360 n.7). If the government entity continued to follow the training program, notwithstanding its\nawareness of past violations, the plaintiff may establish that the entity acted with the deliberate\nindifference “necessary to trigger municipal liability.” Bryan Cty., 520 U.S. at 407.\n\n        Alternatively, in a “narrow[er] range of circumstances,” see id. at 409, deliberate\nindifference may also be proven under the “single-incident” theory of liability hypothesized by\nthe Supreme Court in Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 & n.10. In essence, the theory is that, in some\n“rare” circumstances, “the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train could be so patently\nobvious that a city could be liable under § 1983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of\n\fNo. 14-5603                         Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..            Page 38\n\nviolations.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1361. Canton gave one example of this hypothesis: where a\nmunicipality provides its police officers with firearms, the need to train officers on the\nconstitutional limitations on the use of deadly force is “so obvious” that the failure to do so\nwould amount to deliberate indifference. Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 n.10. Taking up the mantle of\nCanton, the majority concludes that an inmate’s need for competent medical care is so obvious\nthat SHP’s failure to train its nurses regarding when to notify medical directors about suspected\nstaph infections amounts to deliberate indifference.\n\n       There are two problems with this position. First, the single-incident theory of liability\ndescribed in Canton applies only rarely outside of the use-of-deadly-force-training example that\nCanton provided. For example, the Fifth Circuit recently attempted to extend the single-incident\nliability theory to the failure of a prosecutor’s office to train its prosecutors about their\nBrady obligations.1 But the Supreme Court rejected that extension, observing that the Canton\nhypothetical “assumes . . . no knowledge at all” of the requisite constitutional standards, whereas\nit was undisputed that prosecutors knew the general contours of their Brady obligations.\nSee Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1363.             More fundamentally, explained the Court, the Canton\nhypothetical involved a circumstance where a police officer was expected to make a professional\njudgment that lay outside his area of expertise: absent specific training, he would not be\n“equipped with the tools” needed to make the relevant legal determination. Id. at 1364. By\ncontrast, an attorney asked to make a Brady determination is not required to go beyond the\nbounds of his professional specialty: he is a legal professional tasked with making a professional\nlegal determination—which his employer could reasonably expect that his generalized\nprofessional training, on-the-job experience, and adherence to professional competence and\nethics standards would generally prepare him to do. See id. at 1361–63. Given that an employer\ncould expect a legal professional to be able to ascertain for himself his basic legal obligations,\nthe failure of the prosecutor’s office to alert its attorneys to the full panoply of their legal duties\ndid not subject it to failure-to-train liability, even if “additional training would have been\nhelpful.” Id. at 1363.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 39\n\n        Connick’s reasoning is squarely applicable to the LPNs in the present case. An LPN\nmaking a rudimentary decision regarding how severe an inmate’s symptoms are is not engaging\nin the type of professional cross-over envisioned in Canton’s hypothetical. Instead, LPNs in\nsuch situations are medical personnel making rudimentary medical judgments. Although the\nmajority presents LPNs as if they have no medical ability whatsoever, they are clearly trained in\nthe medical field, have at least some degree of knowledge about medical symptoms presented by\ninmates, and are expected to make at least basic decisions about identifying circumstances under\nwhich further medical examination (such as by a doctor) is necessary. No doubt more advanced\ntraining would make them better able to do so; but the fact that, in hindsight, SHP could have\ndone more instead of primarily relying upon its LPNs’ formal medical training does not make\nSHP liable under Monell. See Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1364 (“[S]howing merely that additional\ntraining would have been helpful in making difficult decisions does not establish municipal\nliability.”).\n\n        The second point is related. Even with the single-incident theory applied in this context,\nthe particular need at issue—the need for increased training regarding when an LPN should\ncontact a medical director—is far from “obvious.” In this regard, the majority conflates the\ngeneralized need for competent medical care with the much more particularized need for LPNs\nto be trained regarding the appropriate circumstances under which to refer inmates to a medical\ndirector. See Bryan Cty., 520 U.S. at 412 (observing that culpability “depend[s] on a finding that\nthis officer was highly likely to inflict the particular injury suffered by the plaintiff”). The\nCanton exception applies, if ever, only when the need is so patent as to be self-evident: training\nfor armed officers on the constitutional boundaries of the use of deadly force, for instance.\nSee id. at 410 (noting that the single-incident theory applies only if there is a “glaring omission in\na training regimen”). By contrast, the need here is much more particularized. It is not at all\nobvious that an LPN who has already completed a course of study and has been specifically\ninstructed to follow SHP’s written policies will always need more training regarding when to\ncontact a medical director about a suspected staph infection. It is undisputed that SHP did, in\nfact, have policies in place on this question, which it required its nurses to read and follow.\nTherefore, Canton’s hypothesized single-incident theory does not apply to this case.\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 40\n\n       Shadrick also argues SHP had notice that its training program was constitutionally\ndeficient based on a prior pattern of similar constitutional violations by SHP employees.\nHowever, the majority declines to reach this issue. In this regard, I note that Shadrick’s pattern-\nof-prior-incidents theory lacks its most basic requirement: a pattern.\n\n       The sequence of prior constitutional violations must be “similar” to the misconduct\nalleged in the case at hand for the prior violations to have put the government entity on notice\nthat the same conduct was likely to reoccur. Connick, 563 U.S. at 1360. Connick gave some\nclues as to how particularized the similarity must be.         There, the Court tied the notice\nrequirement not simply to the generalized type of constitutional harm at issue, but to the specific\nmanner in which the constitutional harm occurred. Connick held that four prior Brady violations\ndid not place a prosecutor’s office on notice that its training was inadequate “with respect to the\nsort of Brady violation at issue here” because none of the prior Brady violations “involved\nfailure to disclose blood evidence, a crime lab report, or physical or scientific evidence of any\nkind.” Id. In other words, the previous instances of misconduct must not only violate the same\nconstitutional rights, but they must violate them in almost the same way. See D’Ambrosio,\n747 F.3d at 388 (three prior instances of impermissible prosecutorial statements did not give\nmunicipality notice that a prosecutor would likely commit a Brady violation).\n\n       Shadrick claims that SHP’s deliberate indifference to inmates’ plight is demonstrated by\nthe fact that, before Butler died, several other inmates received substandard medical treatment in\nother jails staffed by SHP. She points to two incidents in particular: (1) the March 2009 death of\nan inmate in a Warren County, Kentucky jail, under circumstances where the nurse hired by SHP\nfailed to contact the medical director for an inmate who exhibited symptoms of alcohol\nwithdrawal, see Finn v. Warren Cty., 768 F.3d 441, 447 (6th Cir. 2014); and (2) the January\n2010 death of an inmate in a LaRue County, Kentucky jail where a nurse allegedly failed to refer\nto a doctor an inmate who claimed that she was experiencing heart attack symptoms, see Jones v.\nSHP, No. 3:10-cv-00742 (W.D. Ky.).\n\n       These two incidents involved two different sets of medical symptoms at two different\njails. Tragic as they were, these incidents did not give SHP knowledge that their employees at\nyet a different jail were likely to be unable to properly alert a medical director about an inmate\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                Page 41\n\nwith a suspected staph infection. After all, SHP is a large company: it employs more than\n700 nurses at 198 jails in twelve states. The fact that two of SHP’s 700 nurses in two of its\n198 jails housing thousands of inmates made two bad decisions regarding when to contact a\nmedical director about alcohol withdrawal or heart attack symptoms does not translate into\nknowledge that, absent more rigorous training, employees at all of its jails likely would make\nbad judgment calls about when to contact a medical director about a suspected staph infection.\n“As a matter of probability, if violations were the ‘highly predictable consequence’ of a failure to\ntrain, then we would expect to see more than just one violation in hundreds or thousands of\ncases.” Thompson v. Connick, 578 F.3d 293, 305 (5th Cir. 2009) (Clement, J., dissenting), rev’d,\n131 S. Ct. 1350 (2011). It does not detract from the tragedy of the prior events to recognize that\nthey cannot have made SHP “deliberately indifferent” to whether all 700 of its nurses needed\nmore training on referring suspected staph infections to a medical director.\n\n       Shadrick also relies on her expert, who concluded that SHP should have known that its\nbusiness model would present unacceptable risks of harm to inmates by relying too heavily upon\nLPNs rather than upon more highly trained medical practitioners. But it bears emphasizing that\nSHP cannot be held liable under § 1983 merely for structuring or conducting its business in a\nnegligent manner. Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359. In opposing SHP’s motion for summary\njudgment, Shadrick was required to submit evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could\nfind that SHP consciously chose to violate inmates’ constitutional rights.           Id. at 1359–60.\nOn this record, a reasonable jury could not make that finding.\n\n       Finally, Shadrick asserts that SHP demonstrated deliberate indifference by ratifying its\nnurses’ conduct through its after-the-fact investigation. While the majority claims it does not\nreach this issue, it cites SHP’s investigation and failure to discipline or retrain its LPNs as proof\nof deliberate indifference. But Monell liability applies only where the government entity’s\npolicy caused the deprivation of the injured party’s constitutional rights. D’Ambrosio, 747 F.3d\nat 388–89. Nothing SHP did after Butler died could have caused his death. SHP’s response to\nthe death is irrelevant to the question of its deliberate indifference before the death.\n\n       It may be evident in retrospect that SHP’s employees should have handled matters much\ndifferently. However, SHP can be held liable under § 1983 only if it knew of its employees’\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 42\n\nspecific training deficits before Butler died in its care. Shadrick has not offered proof of that\nknowledge. The district court properly resisted the impulse to presume foreknowledge from\nhindsight clarity. I would affirm summary judgment on Shadrick’s Monell claim against SHP.\n\n                                                II.\n\n       The majority also reverses summary judgment in favor of SHP on Shadrick’s state-law\nnegligence claim, holding that SHP is not entitled to governmental immunity. In my view, the\nmajority opinion overlooks Kentucky precedent affording qualified official immunity to private\nentities that contract with a Kentucky county to provide medical services to county jail inmates.\nSee Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d at 641. Based on Jerauld, I would affirm the district court’s ruling that\nSHP is entitled to qualified official immunity regarding Shadrick’s state-law negligence claim.\n\n       Under Kentucky law, qualified official immunity is derivative of governmental (or\n“official”) immunity. Autry, 219 S.W.3d at 717. Governmental immunity protects a government\nentity where “the entity exercises a governmental function,” which is “a ‘function integral to\nstate government.’” Comair, Inc. v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cnty. Airport Corp., 295 S.W.3d\n91, 99 (Ky. 2009) (quoting Ky. Ctr. for the Arts Corp. v. Berns, 801 S.W.2d 327, 332 (Ky.\n1990)). Governmental immunity extends not only to the actions of the entity, but also to the\nofficial acts of the entity’s employees, agents, and alter egos. Autry, 219 S.W.3d at 717, 719.\n\n       When agents performing state functions are sued in their official capacities, they are\nabsolutely immune from the claims. Id. at 718. When sued in their individual capacities,\nhowever, they may invoke only the doctrine of qualified official immunity, “which affords\nprotection from damages liability for good faith judgment calls made in a legally uncertain\nenvironment.” Yanero v. Davis, 65 S.W.3d 510, 522 (Ky. 2001). Qualified official immunity is\nappropriate if the agent’s conduct (1) is a discretionary, rather than a ministerial act—i.e., one\n“involving the exercise of discretion and judgment, or personal deliberation, decision, and\njudgment”; (2) is made in good faith; and (3) is within the scope of the agent’s authority. Id.\n\n       There is no dispute that, under Kentucky law, qualified official immunity extends to\nprivate medical providers who contract with government entities to provide medical care to\ninmates. See Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d at 641. This is so because the application of qualified official\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..             Page 43\n\nimmunity does not depend upon the particular titular or employment characterization of the\nindividual who is performing the governmental function on the government entity’s behalf, but\ninstead “rests . . . on the function performed.” Id.; see also Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 521. In other\nwords, the question is whether the medical provider has stepped into the shoes of the state; if it\nhas, it is entitled to the state’s immunity protection.\n\n        In this regard, the Kentucky Court of Appeals’ decision in Jerauld is dispositive. There,\nthe court explicitly recognized that a private psychologist was entitled to qualified official\nimmunity, despite the fact that he was not an employee of a county jail but was simply\ncontracted to provide medical services there. Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d at 641. The determining\nfactor was that the psychologist—regardless of his specific employment relationship with the\ncounty—was performing a government function on the government entity’s behalf. Id.\n\n        Jerauld squarely forecloses plaintiff’s claim that SHP is not entitled to qualified official\nimmunity under Kentucky law. Jerauld holds that private entities that have contracted with a\nKentucky county to provide medical services to inmates in the county jail are eligible for\nqualified official immunity. Id. SHP—a private entity that has contracted with a Kentucky\ncounty to provide medical services to inmates in the county jail—is therefore eligible for\nqualified official immunity under Kentucky law.\n\n        The majority attempts to distinguish Jerauld in two different ways. Neither is persuasive.\n\n        First, the majority asserts that immunity extends to private corporations only if they were\ncreated by the state government—which SHP clearly was not. Contrary to the position of the\nmajority, Comair did not erect an inflexible two-pronged test in which the threshold question is\nwhether a private entity was created by a state agency as opposed to having been birthed in the\nfree market. To begin with, Comair’s observation that an entity’s origins could be relevant to the\nimmunity analysis came not in the context of a comparison between state-created entities and\nprivate entities, but between state-created entities and municipality-created entities. 295 S.W.3d\nat 99–100. In general, entities created by a state or county are entitled to share in the state’s\nsovereign immunity if they exercise a state function. However, entities created by a municipal\ncorporation are generally not entitled to immunity because Kentucky state sovereign immunity\ndoes not extend to local municipalities. Id.; see id. at 94–95. See also Coppage Constr. Co. v.\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 44\n\nSanitation Dist. No. 1, 459 S.W.3d 855, 860 (Ky. 2015) (“Comair set forth the aforementioned\nanalytical framework that focuses on whether the entity in question was created by the state or a\ncounty, as opposed to a city, and then whether the functions the entity performs are integral to\nstate government.” (emphasis added)). Under Comair, “the origins of the entity” may figure into\nthe analysis only because the etiology of the entity might answer whether the function that it\nperforms implicates state-level concerns as opposed to merely local ones. Comair, 295 S.W.3d\nat 99; see also Coppage Constr. Co., 459 S.W.3d at 861–62. But if the source and nature of the\nfunction is otherwise clear—because, for example, the private entity has contracted with the state\nor county to perform one of its quintessentially governmental functions—there is no need to\nretrace the entity’s genesis. That explains why—in a decision post-dating Comair—the court in\nJerauld found no need to interrogate the particular corporate form under which the psychologist\nwas providing services to the prison; it was enough that he had contracted to perform a state—\nrather than a local—function. 353 S.W.3d at 641.\n\n       In addition, it strains credulity to assert that Comair constructed a new, inflexible, two-\npronged official-immunity test when much of its analysis is dedicated to rejecting the court’s\nprevious two-pronged official-immunity test as “overly simple, failing to allow for subtlety, and\ntoo limiting.” Comair, 295 S.W.3d at 99 (limiting Berns, 801 S.W.2d at 332). In fact, Comair\nexplicitly disclaimed any assertion that it was imposing a bright-line test, noting that the question\nof official immunity must instead be resolved on a “case by case analysis.” Id. According to the\ncourt, an inquiry into “the origins of the entity” claiming immunity should not be “reduce[d] . . .\nto a simple test” but should instead “be treated as a guiding principle.” Id.\n\n       The recent decision from the Kentucky Court of Appeals in Kentucky River does not\nsuggest otherwise.    See Ky. River Foothills Dev. Council, Inc. v. Phirman, No. 2013-CA-\n001858-MR, 2015 WL 1746483 (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2015). In Kentucky River, the court\ngrappled with whether private organizations that merely received grants from the state were\nentitled to qualified official immunity. The court reasoned that they were not, observing that\nthey had not been created by the state and that “[a] line must be drawn somewhere before the\nconcept of governmental immunity is expanded far beyond any reasonable parameter.” Id. at *9.\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 45\n\n       SHP’s circumstances are, of course, not those of an entity that simply receives a\ngovernmental grant. Grants to private organizations are typically used to encourage private\nactors to engage in conduct the state deems beneficial for the general citizenry; grants are not\nordinarily used to outsource a government’s own core functions. Kentucky River therefore\nspeaks only to situations where a grant is used to incentivize private entities to perform conduct\n“traditionally associated with government,” such as furthering beneficial progress in “poverty,\neducation, housing, medical research, or other similar concerns.” Id. It does not control cases\nlike this one, where the conduct outsourced to the private sector—providing medical care for\ninmates—is not merely something that traditionally the state has encouraged but is something\nthat traditionally the state alone has performed. The best way to understand Kentucky River, in\nother words, is as creating another distinction based upon the function performed. If the private\nentity is pursuing ends that are simply consonant with the state’s interests, then it is not eligible\nfor qualified official immunity, regardless of its source of funding. See Coppage Constr. Co.,\n459 S.W.3d at 862 (“[N]ot every ‘public purpose’ qualifies as an ‘integral state function.’”). But\nif the private entity’s activity actually supplants the state’s performance of an activity\ntraditionally within the state’s bailiwick—such as running a prison—then the doctrine is\navailable to the private entity that is performing the traditional state function on the state’s\nbehalf. See id. at 864 (listing, as examples of “traditional and necessary state function[s],”\n“those functions performed by the state police, our public schools, the corrections system, and\npublic highways and airways.” (emphasis added)).\n\n       To the extent Kentucky River characterized Comair as providing for a two-part test, we\nare constrained to follow precedent from the Supreme Court of Kentucky where it diverges from\nthat of the lower courts. Compare Kentucky River, 2015 WL 1746483, at *6 (“The test for\nwhether an entity qualifies for governmental immunity is two-pronged.”) with Comair, 295\nS.W.3d at 99 (the inquiry into “the origins of the entity” claiming immunity should not be\n“reduce[d] . . . to a simple test”). See also Furtula v. Univ. of Ky., 438 S.W.3d 303, 305 n.1 (Ky.\n2014) (suggesting that Comair was most focused on the performance of a government function).\n\n       The majority also attempts to distinguish Jerauld by asserting that Kentucky extends the\ndoctrine of qualified official immunity to individuals only, not to corporations. Again, Jerauld\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 46\n\nunequivocally holds that qualified official immunity extends to a private medical provider if he\ncontracts as an individual to provide medical services to a county jail. See Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d\nat 641. Yet, under the majority’s view of Kentucky law, qualified official immunity would not\nextend to the same medical provider if he provided identical services but chose to organize his\nbusiness as a limited liability corporation instead of a limited liability partnership.\n\n       The flaw with this position is that Kentucky has never held that the form of a defendant’s\nbusiness is a determinative factor for qualified official immunity purposes. Jerauld gives no hint\nthat the defendant’s business form was relevant to the defense; in fact, it explicitly reiterated that\nformalities such as the “status” of an agent were irrelevant to the issue and that the crucial\ninquiry centered upon “the function performed.” Id. And Kentucky courts have repeatedly\nrejected the notion that a private entity performing a governmental function is not entitled to\nqualified official immunity merely because it is a private corporation taking on the performance\nof a state function by contract. See Bryant v. Pulaski Cty. Det. Ctr., 330 S.W.3d 461, 465\n(Ky. 2011); Autry, 219 S.W.3d at 719; Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 529–30. In the same vein, the\nmajority’s assertion that SHP’s status as an independent contractor matters to the question of\nqualified official immunity cannot be reconciled with Kentucky’s repeated admonition that\napplication of qualified official immunity “rests not on the status or title of the officer or\nemployee, but on the function performed.” Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d at 641. “[S]tatements by the\nentity [seeking immunity],” whether made in a contract or otherwise, “are not controlling.”\nComair, 295 S.W.3d at 102.\n\n       To reach its conclusion, the majority finds it necessary to downplay portions of Supreme\nCourt of Kentucky decisions as dicta and as “incorrect[ ]” in order to reconcile them with its\npreferred interpretation of decisions from the Kentucky Court of Appeals. But a far simpler way\nto resolve the purported conflict is to recognize there is none. The individual-corporation binary\nthe majority posits in this context is illusory. The majority appears to conflate the concepts of\n“individual capacity,” “individual persons,” and “natural (as opposed to corporate) persons.” In\nany event, Kentucky qualified official immunity does not depend upon the distinctions of\ncorporate form or the specifics of corporate genealogy. The “important aspect” of the official-\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 47\n\nimmunity analysis, as Comair emphasized, is the entity’s function, not its status nor its origin.\nComair, 295 S.W.3d at 99.\n\n       That determination resolves Shadrick’s negligence claim against SHP.           There is no\ndispute that SHP, despite its designation as an independent contractor, is providing a\nparadigmatic government function—namely, providing medical care to incarcerated individuals.\nSHP has stepped into the county’s shoes to perform that function, and to the extent that its\nconduct is in good-faith, discretionary furtherance of that function, it is entitled to qualified\nofficial immunity. See Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 530. Nor is there any question that SHP meets the\nremainder of the qualified official immunity elements. See id. at 522. Shadrick does not argue\nthat SHP exceeded its authority or acted in bad faith, and there is no merit to the claim that\nSHP’s promulgation of policies for how to best implement its dictate from the county is a\nministerial rather than a discretionary act. See Williams v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 113 S.W.3d 145,\n150 (Ky. 2003) (“Promulgation of rules is a discretionary function.”); Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 529\n(same). Accordingly, the district court correctly ruled that SHP was entitled to qualified official\nimmunity under Kentucky law.\n\n                                               III.\n\n       For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the district court’s judgment.\n\f",

Hopkins County contracted with Southern Health Partners,\nInc. (SHP), a private, for-profit corporation, to provide medical services to inmates housed at the\nHopkins County Detention Center (HCDC) in Madisonville, Kentucky.              On April 8, 2010,\ntwenty-five year old Tyler Butler entered the jail to serve a short sentence for a misdemeanor\noffense.   He died three days later from complications of an untreated methicillin-resistant\nstaphylococcus aureas (MRSA) infection.\n\n       Butler’s mother, Cindy (Jimenez) Shadrick, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging\nthat SHP’s failure to train and supervise its LPN nurses employed at HCDC violated Butler’s\nconstitutional right to adequate medical care. She also alleged that SHP was negligent under\nstate law. The district court granted summary judgment for SHP on both claims. Jimenez v.\nHopkins Cnty., No. 4:11-CV-00033, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">176478</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *19–20, 22–23 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 13,\n2014). Because the record demonstrates that there are genuine issues of material fact on the\n§ 1983 claim and SHP is not entitled to share the county’s governmental immunity on the state-\nlaw claim, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment in favor of SHP and REMAND the\ncase to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n                                             I. FACTS\n\n       Butler arrived at HCDC close to five o’clock on the afternoon of Thursday, April 8, 2010.\nHe was late for his scheduled intake appointment, having walked from his residence. While\nButler stood outside the door, Sherri McDowell, control tower operator, saw Butler put\nsomething in his mouth and swallow it. McDowell relayed her observation to Deputy Angela\nPeterson who, along with Deputy Rodney Knox, started Butler’s booking procedures.\n\n       As Deputy Knox helped Butler change into a prison uniform, Butler vomited twice.\nDeputy Peterson noticed that Butler appeared to be under the influence and was sweating\nprofusely. As she asked him questions to complete intake paperwork, his demeanor deteriorated\nand he had difficulty standing up.\n\fNo. 14-5603                          Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                       Page 3\n\n        Butler told Deputy Peterson that he had an MRSA infection and he was under a doctor’s\ncare for high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and osteoporosis. He listed several\nprescribed medications he was taking, including Prednisone, Seroquel, Allopurinol, and\nColchicine.1 Butler denied drug or alcohol addiction.\n\n        Deputies Peterson and Knox did not want to admit Butler to HCDC due to his condition.\nDeputy Peterson asked Sgt. Carl Coy if she could refuse admission to an inmate who reported to\nHCDC pursuant to a court order. Sgt. Coy replied, in alignment with HCDC’s written policy,\nthat only the medical staff possessed authority to refuse admission of an inmate for health\nreasons.\n\n        Deputy Peterson asked Candace Moss, SHP’s licensed practical nurse (LPN) and the only\nmedical staff member on duty at the jail, to come to the booking area. It was 5:25 p.m., shortly\nbefore shift change at 6:00 p.m. Moss knew she had to decide whether to admit Butler to\nHCDC. He told her that he had frequent staph infections, that he was suffering from a staph\ninfection in his groin area that his doctor had not examined, and that he had been vomiting,\nwhich he attributed to the staph infection. He also reported having a different rash that his doctor\nhad not diagnosed.\n\n        As Moss talked with Butler, Deputy Jennifer Chambers noticed that Butler’s skin was\nclammy, he was almost gray in color, and he was bloated. She saw Butler lift his shirt and pants\nlegs to show Moss open wounds on his skin. He pulled his pants down slightly to show Moss\npart of his groin area. Deputy Chambers heard Butler say, “I have staph infection all over me . . .\nit’s in my groin. . . . I don’t need to be here.”\n\n        Moss instructed the deputies to admit Butler to the jail. As an LPN, she knew she lacked\nthe credentials to diagnose any illness, but she was aware that MRSA infection could lead to\nsepsis and death if not treated. She asked the chief deputy to accompany her as she physically\nexamined Butler, but he declined and told her not to worry about it. Moss returned to the\nmedical office where she wrote a short incident report at 5:40 p.m., placing Butler on 72-hour\n\n\n        1\n          According to Shadrick, Butler also took Lortab, a controlled substance, for arthritis pain and Benicar for\nhypertension.\n\fNo. 14-5603                          Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                       Page 4\n\ndetoxification for suspected drug use and on medical watch due to his reported staph infection.2\nMoss admitted that she did not contact SHP’s Medical Director for HCDC, Dr. Henry Davis, to\nrequest medical orders for Butler’s care during the detoxification period.\n\n        SHP’s “Intoxication and Withdrawal Policy” provided that “[d]etoxification will be\ncarried out only under medical supervision and initiated by the medical staff with physician\noverview on an individual care basis.” R. 101-5 PageID 2037 (emphasis added); R. 84 PageID\n1407–08, 1418. The policy further required consistent monitoring, documentation of all findings\nin the inmate’s medical chart, and documentation of vital signs twice daily on an Alcohol and\nDrug Detox Flow Sheet. Anticipating the end of her shift, Moss expected that Andy Johnson,\nLPN, the nurse coming on duty, would take Butler’s vital signs, start the Alcohol and Drug\nDetox Flow Sheet, and monitor Butler’s condition.                   Moss told Johnson that she had not\nexamined Butler. When Johnson started his shift, he did not examine Butler or record his vital\nsigns on an Alcohol and Drug Detox Flow Sheet. He did not call Dr. Davis for orders to manage\nButler’s medical conditions or to insure continuity of prescription medications.\n\n        HCDC staff assigned Butler to cell 203, located across from the booking area. His bed\nconsisted of a mat placed on a concrete slab three to four inches off the floor. Although HCDC\nstaff placed Butler on suicide watch, there is no evidence that Butler was evaluated for suicidal\nideation.\n\n        During Butler’s short stay at HCDC, his blood pressure was taken once each day on\nApril 9, 10, and 11 at unknown times, as shown on a “Blood Pressure Record Form” bearing the\nnurse initials “AJ.” Nurse Andy Johnson did not recall ever touching Butler. Each reading\nshowed a decrease in blood pressure, but there is no evidence that Butler received blood pressure\nmedication during his confinement or that the nurses took steps to assess why his blood pressure\nwas falling in the absence of medication. A “Medication Administration Record” indicates\nButler received Allopurinol twice on April 9, Prednisone twice on April 9, and Quetiapine\n(Seroquel) once on April 9; however, SHP stated under oath in response to a discovery\ninterrogatory that “Butler’s medical record does not reflect that he was given any medications\n\n        2\n          Apparently, the nursing shift report documented that Butler “‘has a staph infection, no antibiotic—has not\nseen doctor—vomiting—rash all over body. Detox/Medical Watch x 72 hours.’” R. 101-3 PageID 2024. We have\nnot located a copy of this report in the record.\n\fNo. 14-5603                          Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                        Page 5\n\nduring his incarceration beginning on April 8, 2010.” R. 101-12 PageID 2051–52. Even if\nButler received medication at HCDC, there is no evidence it was prescribed by Dr. Davis.3\n\n        None of the nurses who worked shifts during Butler’s confinement at HCDC followed\nSHP’s written policy guidelines for the treatment of staph and MRSA infections. Because these\ninfections can progress rapidly, the policy instructs medical staff to: examine inmate skin\ninfections carefully; monitor the patient and document all medical findings; report the infection\nto the HCDC Medical Director and obtain orders for proper antibiotic treatment; seek emergency\nhospital care if the inmate’s condition worsens; notify jail staff to institute universal precautions\nto prevent spread of the infection; and report the infection to SHP’s corporate headquarters.\nThese steps were not taken after Butler reported his staph infection.\n\n        As medications were passed out to inmates late on Friday afternoon, April 9, Deputy\nKnox heard Butler tell Candace Moss through the food flap of his cell that he had a staph\ninfection. Although Butler was still on detoxification and suicide watch, Moss did not medically\nassess Butler’s condition. Moss later admitted that her failure to monitor Butler and chart his\nvital signs in the medical record violated written SHP policies.\n\n        At mid-afternoon on Saturday, April 10, Butler told Deputy Knox that he was too sick to\nbe in jail. He asked for a sick-call slip, which Deputy Knox provided. Knox and Deputy\nChambers discussed Butler’s bloated appearance and gray pallor, and Knox tried to persuade the\nSHP nurse on duty to see Butler. The record contains no evidence that a nurse examined Butler\nat that time.\n\n        Later on Saturday afternoon, Sgt. Coy accompanied an unknown nurse as she handed out\nmedications to inmates. When Butler stated that he was unable to get up from the floor and walk\n\n        3\n           According to Shadrick, Butler suffered from many medical conditions, including an ongoing MRSA\ninfection that required antibiotic treatments. During Butler’s 2007 confinement at HCDC for ninety days, the staff\nrefused to allow Butler to bring his prescription pain medication into the facility. The nursing staff asked Shadrick\nto refill her son’s 30-day supplies of Allopurinol and Colchicine only once during the 90-day confinement period.\nDuring that same incarceration, Butler contacted his mother repeatedly to report that he was not receiving his\nmedications and to ask for help. He told her that, without his medications, he became immobile and had vomiting\nand diarrhea. According to Shadrick, Butler pleaded, “Please help me. They’re going to let me die.” When\nShadrick called the jail to ask why Butler was not receiving his medications, the nurse told her that medications\nwere handed out to inmates twice each day, at 5:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. If the inmate did not walk to the cell door to\nreceive his medications, the nurse passed the cell without giving the inmate the medication. R. 86 & 86-1 Page ID\n1579–81, 1583, 1588.\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 6\n\nto the cell door to receive his medication, Sgt. Coy and the nurse entered the cell to give Butler\nmedication. The nurse did not converse with Butler or medically assess his condition. There is\nno written documentation that Butler actually received medication on Saturday.\n\n       Early Sunday morning, April 11, Deputy Brandon Lampton saw Butler sitting on the\nfloor of his cell, leaning against the wall. His elbows were red and swollen, and he was in\nobvious pain. Lampton asked Butler if he was okay; Butler replied, “I’m fine.” A few minutes\nlater, at 6:18 a.m., LPN nurse Renee Keller, SHP’s only medical staff member on duty, cleared\nButler from detoxification status early without examining or medically assessing his condition.\nShe wrote in the medical chart that Butler had to remain isolated due to staph infection.\n\n       As Deputy Lampton walked by the cell a few minutes later, Butler asked for a clean\nuniform because he had defecated on himself and he was in too much pain to move. Butler’s\njoints were swollen and hot to the touch. Lampton immediately reported the situation to the shift\ncommander. Lampton and Deputy Stephen O’Reilly lifted Butler from the floor, placed him in a\nrestraint chair, and pushed him to the shower. There the deputies transferred Butler to a plastic\nchair and helped him remove his clothing so that he could shower. Butler told them he was\nsuffering from rheumatoid arthritis. After the shower, the deputies helped Butler with toileting\nand dressing and returned him to his cell.\n\n       Lampton walked to the medical office to inform nurse Keller that Butler had been taken\nto the shower because he soiled his clothes. Lampton asked Keller if she knew about Butler’s\nswollen joints. Keller said she was aware of Butler’s situation and otherwise expressed no\nconcern. According to Lampton, deputy jailers commonly received similar responses from SHP\nmedical staff.\n\n       Within an hour, Lampton learned that Butler had defecated again. When Butler declined\nto take a second shower, Lampton handed him a clean uniform. Because Butler’s condition was\nnow “a real issue,” Lampton returned to the medical office, reported that Butler had diarrhea, and\nsuggested that Butler should be moved to a segregation cell with a higher bunk so that he could\nrotate himself onto the toilet. Keller showed no inclination to check on Butler. Lampton\ninformed his shift commander, Jeremy Witherspoon, that he was moving Butler to a segregation\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 7\n\ncell with a bunk. Lampton and Deputy Poe lifted Butler into the restraint chair and transferred\nhim to the new cell. Lampton had never seen an inmate with such limited mobility.\n\n        Keller’s testimony differed from Lampton’s. She testified that she checked on Butler\nwhile he was showering and helped put his shirt on; that it was her idea to move Butler to a\nsegregation cell with a bunk; and that she asked Butler if he needed anything and he told her he\ndid not. She did not check his vital signs, document her visit with him, or give him any\nmedication. She was not sure whether SHP’s written policies required her to take any such steps.\nShe stated that it was customary for SHP medical staff to examine an inmate only if he submitted\na sick call request.\n\n        On Sunday afternoon, HCDC deputies periodically checked on Butler, but the record\nincludes no documentation of his medical status. Deputies looked through the cell window only\nto confirm that he was breathing. Between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m., Butler asked Deputy Kreitler for\na drink of water because he could not get up. She told him to get the water from his cell faucet.\nButler again asked for a cup of water. Although Kreitler agreed to retrieve one, she never did so.\nWhen she returned to the cell at 4:19 p.m., Butler was lying awkwardly on his bunk,\nunresponsive. She entered the cell and shook him, but he did not respond. He did not have a\npulse and was cold to the touch.\n\n        Nurse Keller was called to the cell. She found Butler cold, blue-gray in color, and\nwithout a pulse. She did not begin CPR. At 4:25 p.m., she paged Dr. Davis, who did not\nrespond. At 4:27 p.m., she called Emergency Medical Services. The county coroner arrived\nshortly after 4:30 p.m. and pronounced Butler dead. An autopsy disclosed that he died of a\nsudden cardiac arrhythmia due to sepsis, a complication of MRSA infection. Significant co-\nexisting conditions were obesity with hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and coronary\natherosclerosis.\n\n        After Butler’s death, Keller called her supervisor, Andrea Pleasant, SHP’s medical team\nadministrator and nurse manager for HCDC. Pleasant had been out-of-town during most of\nButler’s incarceration.   Pleasant called her supervisor, SHP’s regional administrator Betty\nDawes, RN, to ask about completing necessary paperwork. At Dawes’s instruction, Pleasant\nwent to the jail, faxed some papers to SHP headquarters, made sure Keller had tried to call the\n\fNo. 14-5603                           Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                         Page 8\n\ndoctor, and then left. Jailer Joe Blue contacted SHP President and Chief of Operations, Jennifer\nHairsine, and asked her to come to HCDC to evaluate whether any changes should be made.4\n\n         On Monday, April 12, Hairsine and SHP Vice President of Operations, Lisa Watts,\nvisited HCDC. They met with Jailer Blue for fifteen to twenty minutes. Blue summarized the\nrecent events and reported the coroner’s suspicion that Butler had MRSA infection. They did not\ndiscuss Dr. Davis or the county’s contract with SHP. After talking with Blue, Hairsine and\nWatts spoke to Angela Pleasant and a nurse, but Hairsine did not think the nurse was Keller or\nJohnson. If Hairsine spoke to Moss, it was by telephone. Hairsine told Blue that “everything\nlooks fine” and demonstrated no concern that SHP medical personnel had acted improperly.\nAfter a two-hour visit, Hairsine and Watts returned to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Hairsine did not\nknow that Pleasant terminated Johnson’s employment that day.5\n\n         Jailer Blue admitted that he had not read SHP’s policies and procedures completely, but\nhe and his employees relied on SHP nurses and the Medical Director to make all medical\ndecisions concerning inmates. Blue acknowledged that, under Kentucky corrections policy,\nButler was entitled to receive health care comparable to that available to free citizens in the\nsurrounding community.\n\n         SHP is a privately-owned, for-profit Delaware corporation employing 800 workers,\nincluding more than 700 full- and part-time nurses. SHP maintains contracts with 198 jail\nfacilities, thirty of which are located in Kentucky. Other facilities are located in Tennessee,\nOhio, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and\nWisconsin. The company currently does not provide medical services to inmates of HCDC.\n\n         SHP contracted with Dr. Davis to serve as Medical Director at HCDC, but he denied any\nresponsibility for training or supervising SHP nurses. He characterized himself as a consultant\n\n         4\n           The district court record includes only three pages of Hairsine’s deposition. R. 76-2. SHP filed the entire\ndeposition as an appendix to its appellate brief. No. 14-5603 R. 12. Because Shadrick did not object to the filing of\nthe entire deposition, this opinion relies on portions of the deposition that may or may not have been available to the\ndistrict court. The district court’s opinion included citations to pages of Hairsine’s deposition that were not included\nin the lower court record, but we cannot tell whether the full deposition was manually submitted to the district court\nwithout filing or whether the district court adopted citations to the deposition that appeared in the parties’ briefs.\n         5\n          Johnson testified that he was terminated for making a mistake in mailing an inmate drug screen sample\nand not for conduct relating to Butler’s death.\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 9\n\nwho is available to answer questions. He denied providing any treatment protocols to SHP,\nalthough he probably did give some advice about administering insulin. He did not know that\nButler was confined at HCDC until he learned of Butler’s death.\n\n       LPN Candace Moss had never worked in a correctional facility before. She did not\nparticipate in any training program before reporting for work as a visiting nurse, and she could\nnot recall if she ever received a copy of SHP’s written policies and procedures. She did not\nremember signing a form acknowledging that she received the SHP policies and read them. On\nher first day of work at the Taylor County Jail, she received some on-the-job training from Betty\nDawes, SHP’s regional administrator in charge of several Kentucky jails. Moss had never met\nDr. Davis or spoken to him by telephone. She did not receive an evaluation during the eighteen\nmonths she worked for SHP. After Butler’s death, no one from SHP interviewed her about her\ninteractions with Butler.\n\n       LPN Andy Johnson gave similar testimony. He did not attend an SHP training program\nbefore starting work, although he received limited on-the-job training during his first two days of\nemployment, such as learning where supplies were kept. He did not recall ever seeing a copy of\nSHP’s written policies and procedures.\n\n       LPN Renee Keller testified that SHP did not provide her with any training on the SHP\npolicies or how she should perform her job. She recalled that Angela Pleasant conducted\nmeetings approximately every other month to go over policy changes or to explain something the\nnurses were not doing correctly. She remembered being told to read the SHP policies and she\nsigned a document confirming that she had done so, but she did not actually read all of the\npolicies, and she could not discuss any specifics of them during her testimony. She did not know\nwhether SHP policies required her to take Butler’s vital signs or check on him while he was\nconfined in segregation. No one from SHP supervised or critiqued her work or reviewed her\nmedical progress notes to be sure that she was following SHP policies. A large part of her job\ninvolved referring to protocol books without consulting the doctor. After Butler’s death, no one\nfrom SHP talked to her about Butler.\n\n       LPN Angela Pleasant testified that SHP did not require her to have a working knowledge\nof SHP’s written policies and procedures even though she was SHP’s medical administrator at\n\fNo. 14-5603                       Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..          Page 10\n\nHCDC. She consulted SHP’s policies only if problems arose. Although she was responsible for\nsupervising other nurses, she could not recall the policies on MRSA infection, segregation, or\nalcohol and drug detoxification. The nurses at HCDC followed an undocumented custom and\npractice of providing medical assistance only if an inmate asked for it or if there was an\nemergency. If an inmate reported a staph infection and vomiting, Pleasant would advise him to\nput in a sick-call slip and ask for help. If he did not do so within a few days, Pleasant would\nplace him on suicide watch. She reasoned that, if the inmate does not seek help, he must have\nsuicidal ideations. She would follow this course of conduct even though she knows that the\ninmate’s MRSA infection could rapidly deteriorate into sepsis and spread to other inmates and\nstaff in the jail. After Butler died, SHP did not reprimand her or any other nurse for failing to\nfollow any SHP policy.\n\n        Betty Dawes, an RN and SHP’s regional administrator, visited HCDC once every two to\nthree months for four hours or less and sometimes conducted audits. During the visits, she talked\nto the Jailer and the nurses and reviewed some records. She could not recall any issues that were\nraised during these visits. Ordinarily, Dawes does not train new nurses, but she will provide\ntraining if it is needed. She had never read HCDC’s policies, but she expected Angela Pleasant\nto be familiar with them. Dawes conceded that SHP nurses did not meet the standard of care in\nmonitoring and treating Butler and that they failed to follow SHP policies on alcohol and drug\ndetoxification, medical chart documentation, and treatment of MRSA infection. She did not help\ninvestigate Butler’s death or speak to Dr. Davis about it. Approximately two weeks after\nButler’s death, Dawes paid a two-hour “support visit” to the jail. No one had any questions for\nher and she did not ask to review Butler’s medical file. To her knowledge, Hairsine and Watts\ndid not visit the jail after Butler’s death.\n\n        According to President Hairsine, SHP bids a jail contract depending on what a county is\nwilling to pay for nurses. She believes that SHP nurses are trained by virtue of being licensed in\nKentucky, and they might receive additional training from the medical team administrator, the\nregional administrator or the vice-president of operations, all of whom are nurses. Hairsine does\nnot know how RNs and LPNs differ in medical training or how their scope of practice differs\nexcept that she is aware LPNs cannot diagnose medical conditions. SHP relies on the nurse to\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..           Page 11\n\ninform the company of her scope of practice and to notify the company if she is operating\noutside that scope. On one or two occasions, SHP regional administrators notified Hairsine that\ntheir LPN nurses had engaged in conduct outside their scope of practice. Hairsine is also aware\nthat SHP nurses sometimes follow a practice of documenting only medical abnormalities in\ninmate charts instead of maintaining consistent chart documentation.\n\n        Hairsine was fully involved in drafting SHP’s policies and procedures, which are\nreviewed every six months. Hairsine stated that SHP nurses are required to read the policies and\nsign a document stating they have done so, but SHP allows the nurses to implement the written\npolicies at their discretion.\n\n        Hairsine further testified, in contradiction to HCDC’s written policy, that SHP nurses can\nonly recommend to HCDC staff that an inmate should be admitted to the facility; the ultimate\nauthority to make the admission decision lies with HCDC administrators, not SHP staff. In\ncontrast to Dr. Davis’s testimony, Hairsine stated that the Medical Director is responsible for\nsupervising medical personnel at HCDC, including the medical team administrator, Pleasant.\nHairsine spoke to Dr. Davis by telephone after Butler died. Although Dr. Davis expressed\nconcern that he did not know Butler was housed at HCDC, Hairsine thought Dr. Davis did not\npossess any information suggesting that the SHP nurses should have called him about Butler.\n\n        Finally, Hairsine was unaware of any previous complaints about SHP staff who worked\nat HCDC. She conducts a file review after every reported inmate death, but usually she does not\nvisit the jail facility where the death occurred.\n\n        After reviewing this and other evidence, Shadrick’s medical expert, Madeleine LaMarre,\nopined that SHP failed to establish an adequate health care system to meet the serious medical\nneeds of the inmate population at HCDC. In her opinion, all of the SHP nurses who had contact\nwith Butler violated generally accepted standards of nursing practice and all of them exceeded\nthe legal scope of their practice as LPNs licensed in Kentucky. LaMarre further opined that SHP\nfailed to hire sufficient numbers of qualified medical professionals to work at HCDC, and\nbecause LPNs “are not licensed to make independent nursing assessments or nursing diagnoses,\n. . . the use of standing orders and treatment protocols by LPNs is not consistent with Kentucky\nnursing practice standards. Thus, LPNs should be directly supervised by a registered nurse or\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                 Page 12\n\nphysician.” PageID 2032. Because this was not the case at HCDC, LaMarre concluded that the\nSHP nurses practiced without sufficient clinical oversight. She characterized the situation as\nillegal and dangerous, opining that the lack of training and supervision of LPN nurses directly\ncontributed to Butler not receiving appropriate medical treatment, ultimately leading to his death.\n\n       LaMarre observed that this was not the first time Butler had been denied access to a\nqualified health care provider who could diagnose and treat his medical conditions.            She\nprovided several examples of nurses making medical decisions beyond the scope of their practice\nduring Butler’s previous confinements at HCDC in 2007 and 2008. Finally, LaMarre opined that\nSHP did not train the staff adequately on the health care policies and procedures or maintain a\nfunctioning quality improvement program to monitor compliance with SHP policies and\nprocedures.\n\n       On this record, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of SHP, and\nShadrick now appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                 II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment. Cass v.

First, she contends there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact remaining for trial on her § 1983 claim against SHP for failure to train and\nsupervise its LPN nurses. She further argues that she produced sufficient proof to proceed\nagainst SHP on a theory of negligence and that SHP is not entitled to qualified official immunity\non this claim under Kentucky state law. We begin with the federal claim.\n\nA. Failure to train and supervise\n\n       To prevail on a cause of action under § 1983, a plaintiff must prove “(1) the deprivation\nof a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States (2) caused by a person acting\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v.

The second requirement is not in question.

The parties here, like those in Arflack v.\nCounty of Henderson, 412 F. App’x 829, 830 n.2 (6th Cir. 2011)—prior litigation involving\nSHP—do not dispute that SHP stands in the shoes of Hopkins County for purposes of § 1983\nliability.\n\n        The constitutional right at issue arises from the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel\nand unusual punishment because Butler was serving a criminal sentence at the time he died at\nHCDC. See Shreve v. Franklin Cnty., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">743</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133 (6th Cir. 2014). That Amendment\nbarred SHP and its employees from unnecessarily and wantonly inflicting pain on Butler through\ndeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Id. In the Supreme Court’s words,\n\n        elementary principles establish the government’s obligation to provide medical\n        care to those whom it is punishing by incarceration.

Dissent at 36 (“Deliberate indifference, unlike\nnegligence, requires intent.”) The Supreme Court has defined deliberate indifference as “lying\nsomewhere between the poles of negligence at one end and purpose or knowledge at the other”\nand it is “routinely equated . . . with recklessness.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836. Acting or failing to\nact “with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a prisoner is the\nequivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.” Id. “In other words, a plaintiff ‘does not need to\nshow that the [defendant] acted with the very purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that\nharm will result.’” Bonner-Turner v.

The central\nquestion is whether SHP’s failure to train its nurses to adhere to their legal duty to honor the\nconstitutional right of inmates to adequate medical care amounted to SHP’s deliberate\nindifference to the rights of inmates like Butler with whom SHP and its staff come into contact.\nSee City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 388.\n\n         Our analysis focuses on the adequacy of SHP’s training program, see id. at 390, which is\n“necessarily intended to apply over time to multiple employees.” Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 407.\nShadrick cannot meet her burden of proof by showing that one nurse was unsatisfactorily trained,\nthat “an otherwise sound” training program was “negligently administered,” or that harm could\nhave been avoided if the nurse had had “better or more training, sufficient to equip [her] to avoid\n\n\n         6\n           Shadrick cites Taylor v.

In that situation, a\nplaintiff must show that the supervisor at least implicitly authorized, approved, or knowingly acquiesced in\nunconstitutional conduct of a subordinate. Id. Taylor has no application here because Shadrick contends that SHP,\na corporate entity acting under contract with Hopkins County, maintained a policy or custom of failing to train and\nsupervise its nurses. See Essex v. Cnty. of Livingston, 518 F. App’x 351, 355–56 (6th Cir. 2013) (distinguishing\nbetween individual-capacity and official-capacity failure-to-train or supervise claims).\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 16\n\nthe particular injury-causing conduct.” See City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390–91. Instead,\nShadrick can demonstrate SHP’s failure to provide LPN nurses with adequate training and\nsupervision in one of two ways. She can show “[a] pattern of similar constitutional violations by\nuntrained employees” and SHP’s “‘continued adherence to an approach that [it] knows or should\nknow has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees,” thus establishing “the conscious\ndisregard for the consequences of [its] action—the ‘deliberate indifference’—necessary to trigger\nmunicipal liability.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1360 (quoting Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 407).\nAlternatively, Shadrick can establish “a single violation of federal rights, accompanied by a\nshowing that [SHP] has failed to train its employees to handle recurring situations presenting an\nobvious potential” for a constitutional violation. Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 409. This second\nmode of proof is available “in a narrow range of circumstances” where a federal rights violation\n“may be a highly predictable consequence of a failure to equip [employees] with specific tools to\nhandle recurring situations.” Id. In such a case,\n\n       it may happen that in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees\n       the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely\n       to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers . . . can\n       reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need. In that event,\n       the failure to provide proper training may fairly be said to represent a policy for\n       which the city is responsible, and for which the city may be held liable if it\n       actually causes injury.\n\nCity of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390. As an example, “city policymakers know to a moral certainty\nthat their police officers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.” Id. at 390 n.10. Having armed\nthe police officers with guns to accomplish the task, “the need to train officers in the\nconstitutional limitations on the use of deadly force can be said to be ‘so obvious,’ that failure to\ndo so could properly be characterized as ‘deliberate indifference’ to constitutional rights.” Id.\n(internal citation omitted). This method of proof does not require Shadrick to show that SHP had\nactual or constructive notice that its nurses were deficiently trained, as asserted in the dissent;\nproof of actual or constructive notice is necessary only when a plaintiff pursues § 1983 liability\non the pattern theory of constitutional violations. See Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1360–61.\n\n       The likelihood that a particular situation will recur and the probability that an employee\nwho lacks proper tools to respond to the situation will violate a citizen’s federal rights could lead\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 17\n\nto a finding that the policymaker’s decision not to train reflects deliberate indifference “to the\nobvious consequence of the policymakers’ choice—namely, a violation of a specific\nconstitutional or statutory right.”    Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 409.         “The high degree of\npredictability may also support an inference of causation—that the municipality’s indifference\nled directly to the very consequence that was so predictable.” Id. at 409–10.\n\n       When we apply these principles and examine the facts in the light most favorable to\nShadrick, as we must in reviewing a motion for summary judgment, Cass, 770 F.3d at 373, the\nrecord reveals genuine issues of material fact that precluded a grant of summary judgment. SHP\nchose by contract to assume the county’s constitutional medical obligations to its prisoners.\nSHP’s administrators knew that the LPN nurses interacted with dozens of inmates presenting a\nwide and recurring range of medical conditions that required timely and accurate diagnosis and\ntreatment. As we explain more fully below, a reasonable jury could find that the potential risk of\nthe commission of constitutional torts by LPN nurses who lack the essential knowledge, tools,\npreparation, and authority to respond to the recurring medical needs of prisoners in the jail\nsetting is so obvious that SHP’s failure to provide adequate training and supervision to those\nnurses constitutes deliberate indifference to the risk. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836; City of\nCanton, 489 U.S. at 390.\n\n       1. The training program and supervision were inadequate\n\n       The evidence reveals that SHP did not have a training program. See Campbell, 700 F.3d\nat 794. There is no indication in the record before us that SHP designed and implemented any\ntype of ongoing training program for its LPN nurses. While the nurses may have received some\nlimited on-the-job training when beginning their employment, such as learning where supplies\nwere kept, there is no proof of a training program that was designed to guide LPN nurses in\nassessing and documenting medical conditions of inmates, obtaining physician orders, providing\nordered treatments to inmates, monitoring patient progress, or providing necessary emergency\ncare to inmates within the jail environment in order to avoid constitutional violations.\n\n       LPN nurses complete a level of medical training, they obtain a Kentucky license, and\nthey arrive on the job with a limited set of medical skills. This § 1983 claim does not turn, as the\ndissent says, on whether the nurses know how to make “rudimentary medical judgments” about\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 18\n\ninmates’ symptoms or whether they know when to call the doctor. Dissent at 39. Shadrick’s\nexpert witness established that LPN nurses lack any authority to diagnose medical conditions, yet\nthe nurses are routinely confronted with frequent and competing demands for medical care\narising from the needs of numerous inmates suffering from maladies of varying severity. It is\npredictable that placing an LPN nurse lacking the specific tools to handle the situations she will\ninevitably confront in the jail setting will lead to violation of the constitutional rights of inmates.\nA reasonable jury, therefore, could determine that SHP’s failure to train and supervise its LPN\nnurses in meeting their constitutional obligations demonstrates SHP’s own deliberate\nindifference to the highly predictable consequence that an LPN nurse will commit a\nconstitutional violation.    See Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at 409.         A jury could find that “the\nunconstitutional consequences of failing to train” are “so patently obvious” that SHP should be\nheld “liable under § 1983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of violations.” Connick, 131 S.\nCt. at 1361. Even the dissent acknowledges that City of Canton applies if “the need is so patent\nas to be self-evident.” Dissent at 39.\n\n       The lack of training and supervision by SHP is clearly evidenced by the blanket inability\nof the LPN nurses who worked at HCDC to identify and discuss the requirements of SHP’s\nwritten policies governing their work. See Russo, 953 F.2d at 1046 (noting police officers were\nunable “to give specific responses as to the content of their training.”) The nurses professed\nignorance of the written medical treatment protocols and policies purportedly drafted by SHP to\nguide their conduct.        The nurses denied receiving ongoing training about their medical\nresponsibilities within the jail setting, and they disclosed that their superiors did not give\nfeedback or regular evaluations to let them know whether they performed appropriately. A\ngenuine issue of material fact exists about whether SHP required the nurses to sign documents\nattesting that they had read and understood the SHP policies and protocols. Most troubling is the\nadmission of Angela Pleasant, SHP’s on-site nursing manager at HCDC, that she was not\nfamiliar with the SHP policies she was specifically designated to enforce. Key here also is her\nopen acknowledgement that SHP nurses followed an undocumented policy and custom of\nproviding medical assistance only if an inmate asked for it, despite the existence of written\npolicies, procedures, and treatment protocols mandating that nurses take particular actions at\nparticular times.\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 19\n\n       Two high-level supervisors disclaimed any responsibility for training and supervising the\nLPN nurses. Dr. Davis denied that it was his job to train or supervise them, and Betty Dawes,\nSHP’s regional administrator, conceded that she did not offer any type of training program or\ninsure that the nurses were trained to carry out their responsibilities. Further, because she never\ncompared the SHP policies to the jail policies to find any conflicts within them, she made no\neffort to clarify the proper course of conduct for nurses in instances of policy conflict.\n\n       Shadrick traced the lack of adequate training and supervision to the top of SHP’s\norganization. President Hairsine is not college-educated or medically trained, and she could not\nexplain the differences in the permitted scope of medical practice for LPNs and RNs. Rather\nthan provide training and supervision necessary to insure that LPN nurses acted within the scope\nof practice, SHP expected the nurses to define that scope for the company. Hairsine pointed to\nthe SHP policies and treatment protocols as proof of instruction, yet she candidly admitted that\nSHP allowed LPN nurses to use the policies and protocols in their discretion, even though a\ncritical document like the MRSA policy mandated immediate implementation of a specialized\ntreatment protocol.    Shadrick’s expert witness opined that SHP failed to provide adequate\ntraining and supervision to the LPN nurses. See Russo, 953 F.2d at 1047 (“Especially in the\ncontext of a failure to train claim, expert testimony may prove the sole avenue available to\nplaintiffs to call into question the adequacy of . . . training procedures.”)\n\n       Taking this evidence in a light most favorable to Shadrick, see Cass, 770 F.3d at 373, a\nreasonable jury could find that SHP was deliberately indifferent to the need to train and\nsupervise its LPN nurses to provide adequate medical care to inmates, especially in view of the\nobvious risk that the Constitution could be violated without such training and supervision.\nSee City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390.

Ct. at 1355–56; D’Ambrosio, 747 F.3d at 382. In Connick, the Supreme Court\nrecognized that City of Canton “left open the possibility” that “a pattern of similar constitutional\nviolations might not be necessary to show deliberate indifference,” but concluded that a district\nattorney’s failure to train his prosecutors “in their Brady obligations does not fall within the\nnarrow range of Canton’s hypothesized single-incident liability.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1361.\nThe Court reasoned that “[a]ttorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to\ninterpret and apply legal principles, understand constitutional limits, and exercise legal\njudgment.” Id. By contrast, there was “no reason to assume that police academy applicants are\nfamiliar with the constitutional constraints on the use of deadly force. And, in the absence of\ntraining, there is no way for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they require. Under\nthose circumstances there is an obvious need for some form of training.” Id. The Court offered\nfurther contrast by noting that the City of Canton “hypothetical assume[d] that the armed police\nofficers ha[d] no knowledge at all of the constitutional limits on the use of deadly force,” while\nin Connick it was undisputed “that the prosecutors . . . were familiar with the general Brady\nrule.” Id. at 1363. See also D’Ambrosio, 747 F.3d at 386–89 (following Connick to affirm\ndismissal of § 1983 complaint brought by exonerated death row inmate against prosecutor who\nviolated Brady obligations).\n\n       This case mirrors the example given in City of Canton. The obvious need to train police\nofficers who lack knowledge of the constitutional constraints on the use of deadly force parallels\nthe obvious need to train LPN nurses who lack knowledge about the constitutional dimensions of\nproviding adequate medical care to inmates in the jail setting. Unlike licensed prosecutors who\ncompleted law school, routinely attend ongoing continuing legal education classes, receive on-\nthe-job legal mentoring, and labor under rules of professional responsibility to master their Brady\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 21\n\nobligations, Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1361–62, LPN nurses employed within the prison\nenvironment may be required to make professional judgments outside their area of medical\nexpertise. Unless the employer provides necessary training, the LPN nurses lack knowledge\nabout the constitutional consequences of their actions or inaction in providing medical care to\ninmates. Because it is so highly predictable that a poorly trained LPN nurse working in the jail\nsetting “utter[ly] lack[s] an ability to cope with constitutional situations,” id. at 1363, a jury\nreasonably could find that SHP’s failure to train reflects “deliberate indifference to the ‘highly\npredictable consequence,’ namely, violations of constitutional rights,” id. at 1361 (quoting Bryan\nCnty., 520 U.S. at 409). Unlike Connick and D’Ambrosio, this case falls squarely within “the\nnarrow range of Canton’s hypothesized single-incident liability.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1361.\n\n       2. The inadequacy of training resulted from SHP’s deliberate indifference\n\n       Shadrick’s evidence demonstrates that SHP’s inadequate training and supervision of its\nLPN nurses resulted from its own deliberate indifference to the rights of inmates with whom the\nnurses came into contact. See id. at 1360; City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 388. As we explained\nabove, none of the administrators within SHP’s organizational hierarchy—President Hairsine,\nRegional Administrator Dawes, Nurse Manager Pleasant, or the Medical Director, Dr. Davis—\ntook responsibility to train LPN nurses at HCDC or to provide them with appropriate supervisory\noversight to avoid violation of the constitutional rights of confined inmates to adequate medical\ntreatment for their serious medical needs. See City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 388. President\nHairsine’s failure to enforce SHP policies and treatment protocols produced LPN nurses who\nwere ignorant of the constitutional standards governing their medical practice in the jail setting.\nAs a result, the nurses engaged in a custom and practice of requiring seriously ill inmates to\nrequest medical care before any services would be provided, even if the circumstances called for\nemergency medical treatment.\n\n       Evidence concerning the conduct of SHP after Butler’s death further confirms the\ncompany’s deliberate indifference. When Jailer Blue called President Hairsine to HCDC after\nButler’s death, she visited for less than two hours and pronounced “everything was fine.” There\nis no proof that Hairsine, Watts, Dawes, Pleasant, or any other SHP manager investigated\nwhether Butler’s death was related to the adequacy of medical care SHP nurses provided or\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 22\n\nfailed to provide. Nurses Keller and Johnson both testified that no one from SHP contacted them\nabout Butler’s death. Nurse Pleasant stated that neither she nor any other staff member was\ncounseled or disciplined by an SHP administrator following Butler’s death. RN Dawes conceded\nthat the LPN nurses assigned to HCDC did not follow SHP’s policies and procedures in caring\nfor Butler, that the nurses failed to meet the medical standard of care, and that the nurses failed to\nfollow documentation guidelines. But Dawes made no attempt to train the nurses before or after\nButler died, and she offered only a belated “support visit” to the staff following Butler’s death.\nIn the opinion of Shadrick’s expert witness, SHP’s business model by its nature creates\nsubstantial deficiencies in the provision of adequate health care services to inmates.\n\n       The conduct of SHP staff both before and after Butler’s death is relevant to whether\nSHP’s failure to train and supervise its LPN nurses reflected a deliberate or conscious choice for\nwhich SHP may be held liable under § 1983. See City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 389. Because the\ndecisions of President Hairsine represent SHP’s official policy, moreover, a jury could find that\nher deliberate indifference is equivalent to SHP’s deliberate indifference.

The inadequacy in training actually caused, or is closely related to, Butler’s injury\n\n       Reasonable jurors could further determine that SHP’s inadequate training and supervision\nactually caused, or was closely related to, Butler’s injury and death. See Plinton, 540 F.3d at\n464. Butler was a sick man when he reported for admission to HCDC. The deputy jailers did\nnot want to admit him, but they deferred to Candace Moss, SHP’s visiting LPN, who was the\nonly medical staff person on duty and the only one with authority to decide whether to admit\nButler to the jail. Moss admitted Butler to the jail without conducting a medical examination and\ndid not call Dr. Davis for treatment orders. Nurses Johnson, Moss, and Keller each failed to\nassess Butler’s medical condition and seek physician orders during the following 72 hours. At\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v.

Not only were the\nSHP nurses aware of facts alerting them that Butler faced a substantial risk of serious harm if he\ndid not receive timely and proper medical care, there is evidence they actually drew the inference\nof a substantial risk of serious harm and recklessly disregarded it. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835\n(“[A]cting or failing to act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a\nprisoner is the equivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.”) The lack of evidence that SHP\ntrained and supervised its nurses in their constitutional obligations to provide medical care could\nlead a reasonable jury to find that SHP was deliberately indifferent to the inmates with whom the\nnurses came into contact and that SHP’s failure to train and supervise the nurses actually caused,\nor was closely related to, Butler’s death. See Plinton, 540 F.3d at 464.\n\n       Shadrick produced sufficient evidence to create genuine issues of material fact for trial on\nall three elements of her § 1983 claim against SHP for failure to train and supervise the LPN\nnurses. She met SHP’s summary judgment motion with evidence that SHP’s training program is\ninadequate for the tasks the LPN nurses are required to perform, that the inadequacy resulted\nfrom SHP’s deliberate indifference, and that the inadequacy actually caused, or was closely\nrelated to, Butler’s injury. Summary judgment on the § 1983 claim was unwarranted, thus\nrequiring us to reverse and remand the case for further proceedings on this claim.\n\n       Although we do not address Shadrick’s argument that a pattern of tortious or\nunconstitutional conduct by inadequately trained nurses existed, see Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at\n407–08; Burgess, 735 F.3d at 478, evidence about similar incidents of inmate deaths in jail\nfacilities served by SHP may be relevant to whether SHP acted with deliberate indifference to\nthe medical needs of inmates with whom its nurses came into contact at HCDC. This is a trial\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 24\n\nissue for the district court to resolve on remand. We do not address Shadrick’s contention that\nSHP management ratified the conduct of its nurses.\n\nB. Negligence and immunity under Kentucky law\n\n       Shadrick next challenges the district court’s ruling that SHP is protected by qualified\nofficial immunity from the negligence claim brought against it. Because qualified official\nimmunity does not apply to SHP, a corporate entity, and because SHP is not entitled to\ngovernmental immunity as the agent or alter ego of Hopkins County, we reverse the grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of SHP on the negligence claim.\n\n       Sovereign immunity has long protected the Commonwealth of Kentucky from suit,\nComair, Inc. v.

Under the doctrine of governmental\nimmunity, a state or county agency or entity is immune from tort liability if it performs “a\ngovernmental, as opposed to a proprietary, function.” Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 519.\n\n       In providing medical services to incarcerated inmates, SHP claims to act as an arm,\nagent, or alter ego of Hopkins County. To determine whether SHP is entitled to share the\ncounty’s governmental immunity, we apply the test announced by the Kentucky Supreme Court\nin Comair: The immunity inquiry turns on the source of the entity and “the nature of the\nfunction it carries out.” Comair, Inc., 295 S.W.3d at 99; Coppage Constr. Co. v.

The origin of the entity—whether it was created by the\nstate, the county, or a city—is important because the entity’s immunity status depends to some\nextent on whether the parent entity is immune. Comair, Inc., 295 S.W.3d at 99. The second part\nof the test—the nature of the function carried out—must focus “on state level governmental\nconcerns that are common to all of the citizens” of the state, such as the corrections system. Id.\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..             Page 25\n\n       When we apply both components of the Comair test, we conclude that SHP is not entitled\nto share the county’s governmental immunity.          Although SHP performed a governmental\nfunction in providing medical care to county inmates, SHP cannot demonstrate that its origin\nderived from Hopkins County. In response to SHP’s manifest inability to meet the origin\nrequirement, the dissent blends the first part of the Comair test into the second, rendering the\norigin requirement superfluous. Dissent at 44 (“But if the source and nature of the function is\notherwise clear . . . there is no need to retrace the entity’s genesis”) (emphasis added). But the\nKentucky Supreme Court instructs us to analyze both parts of the Comair test and we do so here.\n\n       SHP clearly satisfies the second part of the Comair test because SHP, by contract, was\ncharged with performing Hopkins County’s traditional governmental function of providing\nmedical services to inmates held at HCDC, which is part of a larger state-wide corrections\nsystem. Hopkins County is required by state statute to “prescribe rules for the government,\nsecurity, safety, and cleanliness of the jail and the comfort and treatment of prisoners,” and it\nmust also bear the costs of “providing necessary medical, dental, and psychological care for\nindigent prisoners in the jail.” Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 441.045(1) & (3) (West 2015). Kentucky\nadministrative regulations, however, do not place the burden to provide direct inmate medical\ncare on the counties themselves. Instead, “[t]he jail’s medical services shall be provided by\ncontracting with a health care provider licensed in Kentucky.” 501 Ky. Admin. Regs. 3:090\n(2015) (emphasis added). In conformity with this state regulation, Hopkins County contracted\nwith SHP to provide necessary medical services to inmates incarcerated at HCDC. Hopkins\nCounty retained no control over the manner or means by which SHP provided the contracted\nmedical services because the regulation explicitly states that the county’s Jailer may not restrict\nthe health care staff in the performance of medical duties except to require the medical staff to\nadhere to the jail’s security requirements. Id.      All medical procedures are required to be\nperformed “according to orders issued by the responsible medical authority.” Id. Because SHP\nfulfilled a governmental function of providing medical care to inmates by contract with Hopkins\nCounty, the second part of the Comair test is satisfied.\n\n       SHP, however, cannot meet the first part of the Comair test, which focuses on the origin\nof the entity claiming to be an arm, agent, or alter ego of a county in order to share in its\n\fNo. 14-5603                       Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..            Page 26\n\nimmunity.     Comair, Inc., 295 S.W.3d at 99.          Hopkins County did not create SHP as a\ngovernmental agency, nor did it designate SHP as the county’s agent or alter ego. Instead,\nprivate individuals formed SHP as a for-profit corporation under Delaware law. SHP is managed\nby a private corporate hierarchy and exists to provide medical services to dozens of prison\nfacilities in multiple jurisdictions.\n\n        Hopkins County did not exercise control over SHP because at all times SHP conducted\nitself as an independent contractor of the county. This is expressly addressed in the parties’\nwritten agreement. In Section 9.1 of the contract, the parties created the boundaries of their\nbusiness relationship: “The parties acknowledge that SHP is an independent contractor engaged\nto provide medical care to inmates at the Jail under the direction of SHP management. Nothing\nin this Agreement is intended nor shall be construed to create an agency relationship, an\nemployer/employee relationship, or a joint venture relationship between the parties.” R. 77-26,\nPage ID 1309 (emphasis added). In addition, SHP agreed in section 8.3 “to indemnify and hold\nharmless the County, its agents, servants and employees from any and all claims, actions,\nlawsuits, damages, judgments or liabilities of any kind whatsoever arising out of the operation\nand maintenance of the aforesaid program of health care services conducted by SHP, it being the\nexpress understanding of the parties hereto that SHP shall provide the actual health care\nservices.” Id.\n\n        SHP thus contracted to perform a governmental function, but it may not partake of the\ncounty’s sovereign immunity because it did not derive its existence and status from Hopkins\nCounty. See Comair, 295 S.W.3d at 99. Having failed to satisfy both components of the Comair\ntest, SHP is not entitled to governmental immunity.           Id.   See also Coppage Constr.

Hopkins Cnty., et al..             Page 27\n\n       A recent case decided by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky analyzing and applying the\nComair test supports our analysis. Kentucky River Foothills Dev. Council, Inc. v. Phirman, No.\n2013-CA-001858, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1746483</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. Ct. App. April 17, 2015). We review the case in\nsome detail because its reasoning is instructive here.\n\n       Kentucky River Foothills Development Council was incorporated under Kentucky law as\na private nonprofit corporation in 1962. Id. at *1. Kentucky River was designated under federal\nlaw to serve as a community action agency to combat poverty in four Kentucky counties. Id. at\n*1–2. Congress later repealed statutes governing community action agencies and established the\nCommunity Services Block Grant Program, which transferred responsibility for running the\nprogram from the federal government to the states. Id. at *3. The federal government issued\nblock grants to the states and charged the states with distributing the funds to eligible entities.\nId.   In response, Kentucky enacted a set of statutes to govern the establishment and\nadministration of community action agencies.         Id. at *3–4.    Political subdivisions of the\nCommonwealth could designate themselves as community action agencies or designate eligible\nprivate nonprofit corporations as the community action agencies. Id. at *4. The day-to-day\nactivities of a community action agency were not regulated by statute, and the agency was not\nlimited to administering programs funded solely from state and federal grants. Id. at *5. The\nstate, however, exercised substantial administrative oversight of the community action agency by\nmonitoring and evaluating its compliance with state and federal statutes and administrative\nregulations. Id.\n\n       Applying the Comair test, the Court of Appeals agreed with Kentucky River “that\nproviding services to the poor at the county level has historically been treated as an integral\ngovernment function,” but determined that alone was insufficient to cloak Kentucky River with\ngovernmental immunity. Id. at *6–7. Numerous factors impact the pertinent analysis:\n\n                As recognized in Caneyville, while Kentucky places the most weight on\n       the governmental function element, other factors should also be considered in\n       particularly close cases. These could include: (1) whether state statutes and case\n       law tend to characterize the entity as an arm of the state; (2) whether state\n       resources may be required in satisfying adverse judgments against the entity;\n       (3) whether the state has a financial or otherwise relevant beneficial interest in\n       litigation affecting the entity; (4) how the entity is funded; (5) its level of\n       autonomy; (6) whether the entity deals with primarily local or statewide\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 28\n\n       problems; (7) how state law/courts treat the entity; (8) the ability of the entity to\n       sue and be sued in its own name; (9) whether the entity holds and uses property;\n       (10) whether the entity can take or sell property; (11) the independent\n       management authority of the entity; (12) whether the entity performs\n       governmental or proprietary functions; (13) the entity’s corporate status; and\n       (14) whether the entity’s property is subject to state taxation.\n\nId. at *7. The existence of these many factors “is why it is particularly important to consider the\nfirst prong of the Comair test, whether the entity was established by the government, in tandem\nwith the governmental function prong.” Id. Careful examination of how the entity was created\nand whether it is the offspring of a parental entity immune from suit will necessarily require\nconsideration of the Caneyville factors, “such as how the state statute characterizes the entity, the\nextent by which the state controls the entity and its property, and whether, and to what extent, the\nentity functions apart from the state.” Id.\n\n       The Court of Appeals concluded that Kentucky River “was not created by or at the behest\nof the state or any county of the state.” Id. Instead, Kentucky River is a nonprofit corporation,\nformed by private citizens, which maintains an existence and administers programs\nindependently of the Commonwealth or its counties. Id. Designation of Kentucky River as a\ncommunity action agency “did not vest the Commonwealth with any interest in Kentucky\nRiver’s real or personal property”; “the Commonwealth did not take control of Kentucky River’s\nday-to-day operations or have direct oversight in the administration of programs funded\nseparate[ly] from the block grants”; and “Kentucky River remained free to serve other interests\noutside the scope of its designation as a community action agency.” Id. at *9. The Court of\nAppeals rejected Kentucky River’s argument that the county’s decision to designate it as a\ncommunity action agency “transformed Kentucky River into a government created agency.” Id.\nat *8. Designation of status as a community action agency did not mean that the nonprofit\norganization became “a creature of the state or the county”; rather, the organization continued to\noperate independently as a nonprofit corporation outside the scope of any state and county\noversight connected to its designation as a community action agency.               Id.    The court\ndistinguished Kentucky River’s situation from that in Autry v. Western Kentucky University,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1423764\"><a href=\"/opinion/1423764/autry-v-western-kentucky-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 718 (Ky. 2007), where a state university formed a nonprofit entity for a specific\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 29\n\nand limited purpose, the nonprofit corporation existed only to serve the university, and the\nnonprofit corporation derived its immunity status through the university. Id.\n\n       At bottom, the Court of Appeals concluded, “[t]he receipt of money from the government\nto further a cause important to government should not transform an otherwise private entity into\na governmentally immune agency.” Id. at *9. “A line must be drawn somewhere before the\nconcept of governmental immunity is expanded far beyond any reasonable parameter.” Id.\nAlthough in Kentucky River the Court of Appeals denied governmental immunity to a private,\nnonprofit corporation, its reasoning applies equally to private, for-profit corporations.\n\n       Like Kentucky River, SHP “was not established by the government for its benefit.”\nSee id. SHP was not even subject to the same level of governmental control and oversight that\nKentucky River experienced. SHP was established as a private for-profit corporation long before\nHopkins County designated it as an independent contractor to provide medical services to\ninmates housed at HCDC. See id. State statutes do not characterize SHP as an arm of the state\nand neither does Kentucky case law. In a recent whistleblower suit brought against SHP by\nsome of its employees, the Court of Appeals held that SHP was not a political subdivision of the\nstate because there was little evidence that Campbell County had any control over the specific,\nday-to-day aspects of SHP’s work providing medical services to inmates. See White v. Southern\nHealth Partners, Inc., Nos. 2012-CA-001092, 2012-CA-001106, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2659897</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. Ct.\nApp. June 14, 2013) (unpublished). As in White, SHP here retained full autonomy to decide the\nnature and extent of medical services to be supplied to Hopkins County inmates. The contract\nbetween Hopkins County and SHP expressly provided that no county resources would be\nrequired to satisfy adverse judgments for tort liability because SHP agreed to indemnify Hopkins\nCounty.    SHP maintains independent management and funds itself through profit-making\nenterprise extending beyond its relationship with Hopkins County. The company holds and\ndisposes of its own property and retains the ability to sue and be sued in its own name. SHP\ncontinues to exist as a for-profit corporation long after its contract with Hopkins County ended.\nSee Kentucky River Foothills Dev.

In Coppage, Comair, Caneyville, Furtula,\nJones, and Yanero, the Kentucky Supreme Court has provided guidance for distinguishing\namong the various types of immunity and to aid resolution of difficult questions of state\nimmunity law.

Western Kentucky University, a state agency, created\nthe non-profit Student Life Foundation (SLF) to hold title to dormitory properties. Autry,\n219 S.W.3d at 718.     The university transferred title to SLF, which in turn entered into a\nmanagement agreement with the university providing that the university would operate the\ndormitories, collect rent, and hire and supervise staff. Id. A wrongful death action was brought\nagainst the university, SLF, and several individual defendants in their official and individual\ncapacities. Id. at 716. The Kentucky Supreme Court concluded that the university was fulfilling\nits statutory duty by managing the dorms and was entitled to governmental immunity. Id. at 718.\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..             Page 32\n\nSLF, formed by the university for a specific and limited purpose, existed only to serve the\nuniversity’s needs and acted as its alter ego. Id. at 718–19. Because “SLF has no truly\nindependent existence from” the university, delegating dorm management to the university was\n“tantamount to [the university] delegating to itself.” Id. at 719. Therefore, SLF shared the\nimmunity of the state agency, the university. Id.\n\n       In this case, by contrast, Hopkins County did not create SHP, nor was SHP the alter ego\nof Hopkins County, nor did SHP exist solely to serve Hopkins County. As the Kentucky Court\nof Appeals did in Kentucky River, we distinguish Autry on this basis.\n\n       We acknowledge a troublesome paragraph at the end of Autry which notes that “SLF was\nsued directly, on the assumption that it is not a governmental entity at all. This amounts to suing\nSLF in its individual capacity. In that capacity, SLF is entitled to qualified official immunity,\ndepending upon whether its delegation of management . . . was a discretionary or a ministerial\nfunction.” Id. The opinion then relies on Yanero, a case applying qualified official immunity to\nindividual persons, to support a statement that SLF engaged in discretionary acts and was\nentitled to qualified official immunity in its individual capacity. Id.\n\n       We think this paragraph is dicta and incorrectly applies to a corporate entity the concept\nof qualified official immunity that is meant to protect individual persons from suit in their\nindividual capacities, thereby blurring a distinction in immunity law that Kentucky courts\nordinarily draw with precision.

Under Monell, governmental actors “are responsible only for their own illegal acts.\n\fNo. 14-5603                        Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..

Furthermore, the\ndispositive question regarding SHP’s liability is whether “the challenged conduct occur[red]\npursuant to [SHP’s] ‘official policy,’ such that [SHP’s] promulgation or adoption of the policy\ncan be said to have ‘cause[d]’ one of its employees to violate the plaintiff’s constitutional rights.”\nId. (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 692). In other words, SHP “is liable under § 1983 only where,\n‘through its deliberate conduct,’ it was ‘the moving force behind the injury alleged.’” Id. at 389\n(quoting Alman v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">703</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 903 (6th Cir. 2013)).\n\n        Because the focus must be on SHP’s own decisions rather than those of its employees,\nSHP can be found liable only if it has (1) consciously adopted a specific “policy” of perpetrating\nunconstitutional conduct despite (2) having actual or constructive notice that the policy will\ncause employees to violate constitutional rights, such that SHP can be considered “deliberately\nindifferent” to the fact that its employees will spread constitutional harm. Connick, 131 S. Ct. at\n1359–60.\n\n        Given that Monell liability presupposes a conscious adoption of a course of action “from\namong various alternatives,” City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111441\"><a href=\"/opinion/111441/oklahoma-city-v-tuttle/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823 (1985), a\ngovernment entity’s “culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most tenuous where a claim\nturns on a failure to train.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359. After all, “[i]n virtually every instance\nwhere a person has had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city employee, a § 1983\nplaintiff will be able to point to something the city ‘could have done’ to prevent the unfortunate\nincident.” Id. at 1363 (citation omitted). If an employee acts in a particularly egregious manner,\nit may be tempting to collapse the Monell analysis into a respondeat superior test and to blame\nthe wrongdoer’s employer for failing to ensure that she would do a better job. See id. at 1365\n& n.12. This is the mistake Shadrick makes, claiming that “SHP’s LPNs’ responsibilities were\nso obvious, their violations of SHP’s policies so multitudinous, and their ignorance of Mr.\nButler’s condition so glaring, that SHP must be held responsible.” (Opening Br. at 30; see also\nid. at 31–32 (“The fact that SHP’s nurses violated virtually every provision of SHP’s policies\nbearing on Mr. Butler’s care and treatment speaks to their lack of training, SHP’s indifference,\nand its resultant liability.”)).\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 36\n\n       But as the Supreme Court recently reiterated, an essential characteristic of a failure-to-\ntrain claim is that it requires more than merely substandard training. A plaintiff must show that\nthe government entity’s failure to train its employees in relevant respects is not merely a\nnegligent omission; it must amount to a conscious “decision not to train certain employees about\ntheir legal duty to avoid violating citizens’ rights.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359. “‘[D]eliberate\nindifference’ is a stringent standard of fault”; Monell liability applies only when a state actor has\nitself decided to violate the Constitution by retaining a defective training program that it\nconstructively or actually knows causes employees to violate citizens’ constitutional rights. Id.\nat 1360 (quoting Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118104\"><a href=\"/opinion/118104/board-of-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410 (1997)).\n\n       In the present case, it certainly appears that one or more of SHP’s employees was\nnegligent in following SHP’s policies and providing Butler with appropriate care—with\ncatastrophic results. But the fact that SHP’s training of these particular personnel may have been\ninadequate does not itself establish that SHP was deliberately indifferent to inmates’\nconstitutional rights. Deliberate indifference, unlike negligence, requires intent. It is not enough\nto demonstrate only that SHP’s training regimen did not comport with best practices; Shadrick\nmust establish that SHP was on notice that its training program was constitutionally deficient but\nconsciously decided not to correct it.\n\n       The evidence submitted by Shadrick does not create a jury question regarding whether\nSHP consciously decided to adopt a policy that it knew would cause its employees to violate\ninmates’ constitutional rights. It is undisputed that SHP promulgated policies guiding its nurses’\nconduct in providing health care to inmates, required its nurses to read and sign its policies,\nprovided on-the-job training to its nurses, and held routine monthly meetings with its nurses to\nreview the policies and any updates to them. SHP’s policies specifically required nurses to\nexamine inmates presenting symptoms of drug or alcohol use or staph infections and to notify\nand seek treatment authority and review from the facility’s medical director. In fact, Shadrick\nargued in the district court (and on appeal) that the individual nurses were liable because of their\nfailure to abide by SHP’s extant policies. In other words, Shadrick’s claim against the nurses\nhinges partially on her theory that Butler’s death would have been averted had the nurses\nfollowed the SHP policies upon which they had been trained. The majority is apparently swayed\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 37\n\nby this argument, citing multiple instances in which SHP’s employees failed to follow, or\nappeared unfamiliar with, the company’s polices. But if the underlying harm was caused by\nemployees’ deviation from SHP’s policies, then Monell liability cannot lie: the harm is the fault\nof the individual employees and is not attributable to the governmental entity that employed\nthem.\n\n        Despite the fact that SHP trained its nurses on applicable policies that—if followed—\nwould have prevented the harm suffered in this case, Shadrick contends that SHP should have\ntrained them more extensively. Specifically, she asserts that SHP should have trained its LPNs\nthat they could not “treat[ ] conditions outside their scope of practice and without notifying or\nconsulting SHP’s contract physician.”\n\n        “Without notice that a course of training is deficient in a particular respect,\ndecisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause\nviolations of constitutional rights.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1360. Thus, Shadrick’s claim turns on\nwhether a reasonable jury could find that SHP had actual or constructive notice that its nurses\nwere deficiently trained in violation of the Constitution, despite its policies. Id. On the evidence\nShadrick provided, I submit that it could not.\n\n        “[O]rdinarily,” plaintiffs must demonstrate notice by pointing to a prior pattern of similar\nconstitutional violations by inadequately trained employees. Id. This is because, “[u]ntil the\n[government entity] had notice of persistent misconduct, it did not have ‘the opportunity to\nconform to constitutional dictates,’ nor could its inaction have caused the deprivation of [the\nplaintiff’s] constitutional rights.” D’Ambrosio, 747 F.3d at 388 (quoting Connick, 131 S. Ct. at\n1360 n.7). If the government entity continued to follow the training program, notwithstanding its\nawareness of past violations, the plaintiff may establish that the entity acted with the deliberate\nindifference “necessary to trigger municipal liability.” Bryan Cty., 520 U.S. at 407.\n\n        Alternatively, in a “narrow[er] range of circumstances,” see id. at 409, deliberate\nindifference may also be proven under the “single-incident” theory of liability hypothesized by\nthe Supreme Court in Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 & n.10. In essence, the theory is that, in some\n“rare” circumstances, “the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train could be so patently\nobvious that a city could be liable under § 1983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of\n\fNo. 14-5603                         Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..            Page 38\n\nviolations.” Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1361. Canton gave one example of this hypothesis: where a\nmunicipality provides its police officers with firearms, the need to train officers on the\nconstitutional limitations on the use of deadly force is “so obvious” that the failure to do so\nwould amount to deliberate indifference. Canton, 489 U.S. at 390 n.10. Taking up the mantle of\nCanton, the majority concludes that an inmate’s need for competent medical care is so obvious\nthat SHP’s failure to train its nurses regarding when to notify medical directors about suspected\nstaph infections amounts to deliberate indifference.\n\n       There are two problems with this position. First, the single-incident theory of liability\ndescribed in Canton applies only rarely outside of the use-of-deadly-force-training example that\nCanton provided. For example, the Fifth Circuit recently attempted to extend the single-incident\nliability theory to the failure of a prosecutor’s office to train its prosecutors about their\nBrady obligations.1 But the Supreme Court rejected that extension, observing that the Canton\nhypothetical “assumes . . . no knowledge at all” of the requisite constitutional standards, whereas\nit was undisputed that prosecutors knew the general contours of their Brady obligations.\nSee Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1363.             More fundamentally, explained the Court, the Canton\nhypothetical involved a circumstance where a police officer was expected to make a professional\njudgment that lay outside his area of expertise: absent specific training, he would not be\n“equipped with the tools” needed to make the relevant legal determination. Id. at 1364. By\ncontrast, an attorney asked to make a Brady determination is not required to go beyond the\nbounds of his professional specialty: he is a legal professional tasked with making a professional\nlegal determination—which his employer could reasonably expect that his generalized\nprofessional training, on-the-job experience, and adherence to professional competence and\nethics standards would generally prepare him to do. See id. at 1361–63. Given that an employer\ncould expect a legal professional to be able to ascertain for himself his basic legal obligations,\nthe failure of the prosecutor’s office to alert its attorneys to the full panoply of their legal duties\ndid not subject it to failure-to-train liability, even if “additional training would have been\nhelpful.” Id. at 1363.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           See Brady v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963).\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 39\n\n        Connick’s reasoning is squarely applicable to the LPNs in the present case. An LPN\nmaking a rudimentary decision regarding how severe an inmate’s symptoms are is not engaging\nin the type of professional cross-over envisioned in Canton’s hypothetical. Instead, LPNs in\nsuch situations are medical personnel making rudimentary medical judgments. Although the\nmajority presents LPNs as if they have no medical ability whatsoever, they are clearly trained in\nthe medical field, have at least some degree of knowledge about medical symptoms presented by\ninmates, and are expected to make at least basic decisions about identifying circumstances under\nwhich further medical examination (such as by a doctor) is necessary. No doubt more advanced\ntraining would make them better able to do so; but the fact that, in hindsight, SHP could have\ndone more instead of primarily relying upon its LPNs’ formal medical training does not make\nSHP liable under Monell. See Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1364 (“[S]howing merely that additional\ntraining would have been helpful in making difficult decisions does not establish municipal\nliability.”).\n\n        The second point is related. Even with the single-incident theory applied in this context,\nthe particular need at issue—the need for increased training regarding when an LPN should\ncontact a medical director—is far from “obvious.” In this regard, the majority conflates the\ngeneralized need for competent medical care with the much more particularized need for LPNs\nto be trained regarding the appropriate circumstances under which to refer inmates to a medical\ndirector. See Bryan Cty., 520 U.S. at 412 (observing that culpability “depend[s] on a finding that\nthis officer was highly likely to inflict the particular injury suffered by the plaintiff”). The\nCanton exception applies, if ever, only when the need is so patent as to be self-evident: training\nfor armed officers on the constitutional boundaries of the use of deadly force, for instance.\nSee id. at 410 (noting that the single-incident theory applies only if there is a “glaring omission in\na training regimen”). By contrast, the need here is much more particularized. It is not at all\nobvious that an LPN who has already completed a course of study and has been specifically\ninstructed to follow SHP’s written policies will always need more training regarding when to\ncontact a medical director about a suspected staph infection. It is undisputed that SHP did, in\nfact, have policies in place on this question, which it required its nurses to read and follow.\nTherefore, Canton’s hypothesized single-incident theory does not apply to this case.\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v.

Page 40\n\n       Shadrick also argues SHP had notice that its training program was constitutionally\ndeficient based on a prior pattern of similar constitutional violations by SHP employees.\nHowever, the majority declines to reach this issue. In this regard, I note that Shadrick’s pattern-\nof-prior-incidents theory lacks its most basic requirement: a pattern.\n\n       The sequence of prior constitutional violations must be “similar” to the misconduct\nalleged in the case at hand for the prior violations to have put the government entity on notice\nthat the same conduct was likely to reoccur. Connick, 563 U.S. at 1360. Connick gave some\nclues as to how particularized the similarity must be.         There, the Court tied the notice\nrequirement not simply to the generalized type of constitutional harm at issue, but to the specific\nmanner in which the constitutional harm occurred. Connick held that four prior Brady violations\ndid not place a prosecutor’s office on notice that its training was inadequate “with respect to the\nsort of Brady violation at issue here” because none of the prior Brady violations “involved\nfailure to disclose blood evidence, a crime lab report, or physical or scientific evidence of any\nkind.” Id. In other words, the previous instances of misconduct must not only violate the same\nconstitutional rights, but they must violate them in almost the same way. See D’Ambrosio,\n747 F.3d at 388 (three prior instances of impermissible prosecutorial statements did not give\nmunicipality notice that a prosecutor would likely commit a Brady violation).\n\n       Shadrick claims that SHP’s deliberate indifference to inmates’ plight is demonstrated by\nthe fact that, before Butler died, several other inmates received substandard medical treatment in\nother jails staffed by SHP. She points to two incidents in particular: (1) the March 2009 death of\nan inmate in a Warren County, Kentucky jail, under circumstances where the nurse hired by SHP\nfailed to contact the medical director for an inmate who exhibited symptoms of alcohol\nwithdrawal, see Finn v. Warren Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447 (6th Cir. 2014); and (2) the January\n2010 death of an inmate in a LaRue County, Kentucky jail where a nurse allegedly failed to refer\nto a doctor an inmate who claimed that she was experiencing heart attack symptoms, see Jones v.\nSHP, No. 3:10-cv-00742 (W.D. Ky.).\n\n       These two incidents involved two different sets of medical symptoms at two different\njails. Tragic as they were, these incidents did not give SHP knowledge that their employees at\nyet a different jail were likely to be unable to properly alert a medical director about an inmate\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..                Page 41\n\nwith a suspected staph infection. After all, SHP is a large company: it employs more than\n700 nurses at 198 jails in twelve states. The fact that two of SHP’s 700 nurses in two of its\n198 jails housing thousands of inmates made two bad decisions regarding when to contact a\nmedical director about alcohol withdrawal or heart attack symptoms does not translate into\nknowledge that, absent more rigorous training, employees at all of its jails likely would make\nbad judgment calls about when to contact a medical director about a suspected staph infection.\n“As a matter of probability, if violations were the ‘highly predictable consequence’ of a failure to\ntrain, then we would expect to see more than just one violation in hundreds or thousands of\ncases.” Thompson v. Connick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456596\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456596/thompson-v-connick/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305 (5th Cir. 2009) (Clement, J., dissenting), rev’d,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213505\"><a href=\"/opinion/213505/connick-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011). It does not detract from the tragedy of the prior events to recognize that\nthey cannot have made SHP “deliberately indifferent” to whether all 700 of its nurses needed\nmore training on referring suspected staph infections to a medical director.\n\n       Shadrick also relies on her expert, who concluded that SHP should have known that its\nbusiness model would present unacceptable risks of harm to inmates by relying too heavily upon\nLPNs rather than upon more highly trained medical practitioners. But it bears emphasizing that\nSHP cannot be held liable under § 1983 merely for structuring or conducting its business in a\nnegligent manner. Connick, 131 S. Ct. at 1359. In opposing SHP’s motion for summary\njudgment, Shadrick was required to submit evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could\nfind that SHP consciously chose to violate inmates’ constitutional rights.           Id. at 1359–60.\nOn this record, a reasonable jury could not make that finding.\n\n       Finally, Shadrick asserts that SHP demonstrated deliberate indifference by ratifying its\nnurses’ conduct through its after-the-fact investigation. While the majority claims it does not\nreach this issue, it cites SHP’s investigation and failure to discipline or retrain its LPNs as proof\nof deliberate indifference. But Monell liability applies only where the government entity’s\npolicy caused the deprivation of the injured party’s constitutional rights. D’Ambrosio, 747 F.3d\nat 388–89. Nothing SHP did after Butler died could have caused his death. SHP’s response to\nthe death is irrelevant to the question of its deliberate indifference before the death.\n\n       It may be evident in retrospect that SHP’s employees should have handled matters much\ndifferently. However, SHP can be held liable under § 1983 only if it knew of its employees’\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 42\n\nspecific training deficits before Butler died in its care. Shadrick has not offered proof of that\nknowledge. The district court properly resisted the impulse to presume foreknowledge from\nhindsight clarity. I would affirm summary judgment on Shadrick’s Monell claim against SHP.\n\n                                                II.\n\n       The majority also reverses summary judgment in favor of SHP on Shadrick’s state-law\nnegligence claim, holding that SHP is not entitled to governmental immunity. In my view, the\nmajority opinion overlooks Kentucky precedent affording qualified official immunity to private\nentities that contract with a Kentucky county to provide medical services to county jail inmates.\nSee Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d at 641. Based on Jerauld, I would affirm the district court’s ruling that\nSHP is entitled to qualified official immunity regarding Shadrick’s state-law negligence claim.\n\n       Under Kentucky law, qualified official immunity is derivative of governmental (or\n“official”) immunity. Autry, 219 S.W.3d at 717. Governmental immunity protects a government\nentity where “the entity exercises a governmental function,” which is “a ‘function integral to\nstate government.’” Comair, Inc. v.

Airport Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2006244\"><a href=\"/opinion/2006244/comair-v-lexington-fayette/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99 (Ky. 2009) (quoting Ky.

Governmental immunity extends not only to the actions of the entity, but also to the\nofficial acts of the entity’s employees, agents, and alter egos.

When sued in their individual capacities,\nhowever, they may invoke only the doctrine of qualified official immunity, “which affords\nprotection from damages liability for good faith judgment calls made in a legally uncertain\nenvironment.” Yanero v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1393970\"><a href=\"/opinion/1393970/yanero-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (Ky. 2001). Qualified official immunity is\nappropriate if the agent’s conduct (1) is a discretionary, rather than a ministerial act—i.e., one\n“involving the exercise of discretion and judgment, or personal deliberation, decision, and\njudgment”; (2) is made in good faith; and (3) is within the scope of the agent’s authority. Id.\n\n       There is no dispute that, under Kentucky law, qualified official immunity extends to\nprivate medical providers who contract with government entities to provide medical care to\ninmates. See Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d at 641. This is so because the application of qualified official\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..             Page 43\n\nimmunity does not depend upon the particular titular or employment characterization of the\nindividual who is performing the governmental function on the government entity’s behalf, but\ninstead “rests . . . on the function performed.” Id.; see also Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 521. In other\nwords, the question is whether the medical provider has stepped into the shoes of the state; if it\nhas, it is entitled to the state’s immunity protection.\n\n        In this regard, the Kentucky Court of Appeals’ decision in Jerauld is dispositive. There,\nthe court explicitly recognized that a private psychologist was entitled to qualified official\nimmunity, despite the fact that he was not an employee of a county jail but was simply\ncontracted to provide medical services there. Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d at 641. The determining\nfactor was that the psychologist—regardless of his specific employment relationship with the\ncounty—was performing a government function on the government entity’s behalf. Id.\n\n        Jerauld squarely forecloses plaintiff’s claim that SHP is not entitled to qualified official\nimmunity under Kentucky law. Jerauld holds that private entities that have contracted with a\nKentucky county to provide medical services to inmates in the county jail are eligible for\nqualified official immunity. Id. SHP—a private entity that has contracted with a Kentucky\ncounty to provide medical services to inmates in the county jail—is therefore eligible for\nqualified official immunity under Kentucky law.\n\n        The majority attempts to distinguish Jerauld in two different ways. Neither is persuasive.\n\n        First, the majority asserts that immunity extends to private corporations only if they were\ncreated by the state government—which SHP clearly was not. Contrary to the position of the\nmajority, Comair did not erect an inflexible two-pronged test in which the threshold question is\nwhether a private entity was created by a state agency as opposed to having been birthed in the\nfree market. To begin with, Comair’s observation that an entity’s origins could be relevant to the\nimmunity analysis came not in the context of a comparison between state-created entities and\nprivate entities, but between state-created entities and municipality-created entities. 295 S.W.3d\nat 99–100. In general, entities created by a state or county are entitled to share in the state’s\nsovereign immunity if they exercise a state function. However, entities created by a municipal\ncorporation are generally not entitled to immunity because Kentucky state sovereign immunity\ndoes not extend to local municipalities. Id.; see id. at 94–95. See also Coppage Constr. Co. v.\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 44\n\nSanitation Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 860 (Ky. 2015) (“Comair set forth the aforementioned\nanalytical framework that focuses on whether the entity in question was created by the state or a\ncounty, as opposed to a city, and then whether the functions the entity performs are integral to\nstate government.” (emphasis added)). Under Comair, “the origins of the entity” may figure into\nthe analysis only because the etiology of the entity might answer whether the function that it\nperforms implicates state-level concerns as opposed to merely local ones. Comair, 295 S.W.3d\nat 99; see also Coppage Constr. Co., 459 S.W.3d at 861–62. But if the source and nature of the\nfunction is otherwise clear—because, for example, the private entity has contracted with the state\nor county to perform one of its quintessentially governmental functions—there is no need to\nretrace the entity’s genesis. That explains why—in a decision post-dating Comair—the court in\nJerauld found no need to interrogate the particular corporate form under which the psychologist\nwas providing services to the prison; it was enough that he had contracted to perform a state—\nrather than a local—function. 353 S.W.3d at 641.\n\n       In addition, it strains credulity to assert that Comair constructed a new, inflexible, two-\npronged official-immunity test when much of its analysis is dedicated to rejecting the court’s\nprevious two-pronged official-immunity test as “overly simple, failing to allow for subtlety, and\ntoo limiting.” Comair, 295 S.W.3d at 99 (limiting Berns, 801 S.W.2d at 332). In fact, Comair\nexplicitly disclaimed any assertion that it was imposing a bright-line test, noting that the question\nof official immunity must instead be resolved on a “case by case analysis.” Id. According to the\ncourt, an inquiry into “the origins of the entity” claiming immunity should not be “reduce[d] . . .\nto a simple test” but should instead “be treated as a guiding principle.” Id.\n\n       The recent decision from the Kentucky Court of Appeals in Kentucky River does not\nsuggest otherwise.    See Ky. River Foothills Dev. Council, Inc. v. Phirman, No. 2013-CA-\n001858-MR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1746483</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2015). In Kentucky River, the court\ngrappled with whether private organizations that merely received grants from the state were\nentitled to qualified official immunity. The court reasoned that they were not, observing that\nthey had not been created by the state and that “[a] line must be drawn somewhere before the\nconcept of governmental immunity is expanded far beyond any reasonable parameter.” Id. at *9.\n\fNo. 14-5603                     Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 45\n\n       SHP’s circumstances are, of course, not those of an entity that simply receives a\ngovernmental grant. Grants to private organizations are typically used to encourage private\nactors to engage in conduct the state deems beneficial for the general citizenry; grants are not\nordinarily used to outsource a government’s own core functions. Kentucky River therefore\nspeaks only to situations where a grant is used to incentivize private entities to perform conduct\n“traditionally associated with government,” such as furthering beneficial progress in “poverty,\neducation, housing, medical research, or other similar concerns.” Id. It does not control cases\nlike this one, where the conduct outsourced to the private sector—providing medical care for\ninmates—is not merely something that traditionally the state has encouraged but is something\nthat traditionally the state alone has performed. The best way to understand Kentucky River, in\nother words, is as creating another distinction based upon the function performed. If the private\nentity is pursuing ends that are simply consonant with the state’s interests, then it is not eligible\nfor qualified official immunity, regardless of its source of funding. See Coppage Constr. Co.,\n459 S.W.3d at 862 (“[N]ot every ‘public purpose’ qualifies as an ‘integral state function.’”). But\nif the private entity’s activity actually supplants the state’s performance of an activity\ntraditionally within the state’s bailiwick—such as running a prison—then the doctrine is\navailable to the private entity that is performing the traditional state function on the state’s\nbehalf. See id. at 864 (listing, as examples of “traditional and necessary state function[s],”\n“those functions performed by the state police, our public schools, the corrections system, and\npublic highways and airways.” (emphasis added)).\n\n       To the extent Kentucky River characterized Comair as providing for a two-part test, we\nare constrained to follow precedent from the Supreme Court of Kentucky where it diverges from\nthat of the lower courts. Compare Kentucky River, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1746483</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (“The test for\nwhether an entity qualifies for governmental immunity is two-pronged.”) with Comair, 295\nS.W.3d at 99 (the inquiry into “the origins of the entity” claiming immunity should not be\n“reduce[d] . . . to a simple test”). See also Furtula v. Univ. of Ky., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305 n.1 (Ky.\n2014) (suggesting that Comair was most focused on the performance of a government function).\n\n       The majority also attempts to distinguish Jerauld by asserting that Kentucky extends the\ndoctrine of qualified official immunity to individuals only, not to corporations. Again, Jerauld\n\fNo. 14-5603                      Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..               Page 46\n\nunequivocally holds that qualified official immunity extends to a private medical provider if he\ncontracts as an individual to provide medical services to a county jail. See Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d\nat 641. Yet, under the majority’s view of Kentucky law, qualified official immunity would not\nextend to the same medical provider if he provided identical services but chose to organize his\nbusiness as a limited liability corporation instead of a limited liability partnership.\n\n       The flaw with this position is that Kentucky has never held that the form of a defendant’s\nbusiness is a determinative factor for qualified official immunity purposes. Jerauld gives no hint\nthat the defendant’s business form was relevant to the defense; in fact, it explicitly reiterated that\nformalities such as the “status” of an agent were irrelevant to the issue and that the crucial\ninquiry centered upon “the function performed.” Id. And Kentucky courts have repeatedly\nrejected the notion that a private entity performing a governmental function is not entitled to\nqualified official immunity merely because it is a private corporation taking on the performance\nof a state function by contract. See Bryant v. Pulaski Cty. Det. Ctr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2281299\"><a href=\"/opinion/2281299/bryant-v-pulaski-county-detention-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 465\n(Ky. 2011); Autry, 219 S.W.3d at 719; Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 529–30. In the same vein, the\nmajority’s assertion that SHP’s status as an independent contractor matters to the question of\nqualified official immunity cannot be reconciled with Kentucky’s repeated admonition that\napplication of qualified official immunity “rests not on the status or title of the officer or\nemployee, but on the function performed.” Jerauld, 353 S.W.3d at 641. “[S]tatements by the\nentity [seeking immunity],” whether made in a contract or otherwise, “are not controlling.”\nComair, 295 S.W.3d at 102.\n\n       To reach its conclusion, the majority finds it necessary to downplay portions of Supreme\nCourt of Kentucky decisions as dicta and as “incorrect[ ]” in order to reconcile them with its\npreferred interpretation of decisions from the Kentucky Court of Appeals. But a far simpler way\nto resolve the purported conflict is to recognize there is none. The individual-corporation binary\nthe majority posits in this context is illusory. The majority appears to conflate the concepts of\n“individual capacity,” “individual persons,” and “natural (as opposed to corporate) persons.” In\nany event, Kentucky qualified official immunity does not depend upon the distinctions of\ncorporate form or the specifics of corporate genealogy. The “important aspect” of the official-\n\fNo. 14-5603                    Shadrick v. Hopkins Cnty., et al..              Page 47\n\nimmunity analysis, as Comair emphasized, is the entity’s function, not its status nor its origin.\nComair, 295 S.W.3d at 99.\n\n       That determination resolves Shadrick’s negligence claim against SHP.           There is no\ndispute that SHP, despite its designation as an independent contractor, is providing a\nparadigmatic government function—namely, providing medical care to incarcerated individuals.\nSHP has stepped into the county’s shoes to perform that function, and to the extent that its\nconduct is in good-faith, discretionary furtherance of that function, it is entitled to qualified\nofficial immunity. See Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 530. Nor is there any question that SHP meets the\nremainder of the qualified official immunity elements. See id. at 522. Shadrick does not argue\nthat SHP exceeded its authority or acted in bad faith, and there is no merit to the claim that\nSHP’s promulgation of policies for how to best implement its dictate from the county is a\nministerial rather than a discretionary act. See Williams v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1868358\"><a href=\"/opinion/1868358/williams-v-kentucky-dept-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n150 (Ky. 2003) (“Promulgation of rules is a discretionary function.”); Yanero, 65 S.W.3d at 529\n(same). Accordingly, the district court correctly ruled that SHP was entitled to qualified official\nimmunity under Kentucky law.\n\n                                               III.\n\n       For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the district court’s judgment.\n\f</pre>",
