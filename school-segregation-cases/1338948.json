Mailey, Superintendent.</h1></center>\n<center>No. MO-70-CA-67.</center>\n<center><p><b>United States District Court, W. D. Texas, Midland-Odessa Division.</b></p></center>\n<center>October 21, 1971.</center>\n<p>John F. Conroy, Atty., Department of Justice, Washington, D. C., for plaintiff.</p>\n<p>Thornton Hardie, Jr., Midland, Tex., for defendant.</p>\n<p>Garland Casebier, Midland, Tex., and Lawrence Fuller, Monahans, Tex., for intervenors.</p>\n<p>GUINN, District Judge.</p>\n<p>In this school case, the judicial power of this Court can be invoked only on a showing of discrimination violative of the constitutional standards declared in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 374 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954).</p>\n<p>\"The constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must always <span class=\"star-pagination\">*148</span> reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole.\" (Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Board of Education v. Catherine Scott et al., August 31, 1971, by the Chief Justice).</p>\n<p>\"We are concerned in these cases with the elimination of the discrimination inherent in the dual school systems, not with myriad factors of human existence which can cause discrimination in a multitude of ways on racial, religious, or ethnic grounds. The target of the cases from Brown I to the present was the dual school system. The elimination of racial discrimination in public schools is a large task and one that should not be retarded by efforts to achieve broader purposes lying beyond the jurisdiction of school authorities. One vehicle can carry only a limited amount of baggage. It would not serve the important objective of Brown I to seek to use school desegregation cases for purposes beyond their scope, although desegregation of schools ultimately will have impact on other forms of discrimination.\"</p>\n<p>\"Our objective in dealing with the issues presented by these cases is to see that school authorities exclude no pupil of a racial minority from any school, directly or indirectly, on account of race; it does not and cannot embrace all the problems of racial prejudice, even when those problems contribute to disproportionate racial concentrations in some schools.\"</p>\n<p>\"The record in this case reveals the familiar phenomenon that in metropolitan areas minority groups are often found concentrated in one part of the city. In some circumstances certain schools may remain all or largely of one race until new schools can be provided or neighborhood patterns change. Schools all or predominantly of one race in a district of mixed population will require close scrutiny to determine that school assignments are not part of state-enforced segregation.\"</p>\n<p>\"In light of the above, it should be clear that the existence of some small number of one-race, or virtually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark of a system which still practices segregation by law.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed. 2d 554.</p>\n<p>There have been four plans submitted to this Court, two by the School Board of the Midland Independent School District and two by the Intervenors. The Plaintiff in the case, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, stated that these plans meet the constitutional requirements in so far as they relate to Negro children and the Court agrees with the Plaintiff on this point. Consequently, the decision of this Court is simplified,which plan should be adopted rests entirely in the hands of the school board since this Court can not and would not take over the administrative functions resting in the discretion of school authorities.</p>\n<p>The Defendant School District has stated that it approves the plan referred to as A-2. If it approves this plan and decides to put it into effect it may do so since it does not violate any of the constitutional standards required by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>A different question is presented with regard to Mexican-American children since the record reveals that there has never been any <i>de jure</i> segregation of Mexican-American children, and that there is no evidence showing discrimination violative of the constitutional standards. Consequently, the plan of the Midland Independent School District relating to the De Zavala School is approved. The Plaintiff, Department of Health, Education and Welfare opposes the plan of the School District on this point.</p>\n<p>To give the background of this case, the United States acting through its Department of Health, Education and Welfare, filed its complaint on August 7, 1970, in the Austin Division of the Western District of Texas, including as defendants the Texas Education Agency, the Midland Independent School District and six other school districts in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*149</span> Western District of Texas. Since the Midland Independent School District lies within the Midland-Odessa Division of the Western District of Texas, the case was transferred from Austin to the Midland-Odessa Division and severed from the other defendant school districts which remained in the Austin Division.</p>\n<p>Hearings were held in El Paso, Texas, for pendente lite relief for the 1970-71 school year on August 24 and August 25, 1970. Testimony was presented at that time concerning the proposed plan of the United States and a defense by the School District of its proposed plan for the 1970-71 school year.</p>\n<p>The United States complaint asserted that the school system was operating a dual system based on race and unless restrained by the Court the school district would continue to maintain and operate a dual system in violation of the constitutional rights of the Negro and Mexican-American children. At the hearings in El Paso on August 24 and 25, 1970, the plan of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare was fully developed and the action of the School Board after Brown I to eliminate the previous existing <i>de jure</i> segregation of Negro students was likewise fully developed.</p>\n<p>The record from those hearings established that the School Board of the Midland Independent School District worked diligently with the segregation problem in attempting a desegregation plan which the School Board believed eliminated once and for all all vestiges of the dual system of education. The Court finds that the School Board acted consistently in good faith in preparing its plan in June of 1968 to eliminate all vestiges of the dual system of education in the school district. This plan was as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Midland Plan</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Two High Schools:</i></h2>\n<p>Midland High, fully integrated, is in the center of town and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p>Lee High, fully integrated, is in the northwestern part of town and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Two Freshmen (Ninth Grade) Schools:</i></h2>\n<p>Edison Junior High is in the southeastern part of town, is occupied by ninth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p>Austin Junior High is in the northeastern part of town, is occupied by ninth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Three Seventh and Eighth Grade Junior High Schools:</i></h2>\n<p>Alamo Junior High is in the western part of town, is occupied by seventh and eighth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p>Goddard Junior High is in the northwestern part of town, is occupied by seventh and eighth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p>San Jacinto Junior High is in the west-central part of town, is occupied by seventh and eighth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Nineteen Elementary Schools:</i></h2>\n<p>All children of elementary age are assigned to neighborhood schools, each of which and all of which are located within easy-walking distance from the children's homes to which the respective child is assigned. These assignments are made without regard to race and are made strictly on a neighborhood zoning arrangement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Majority to Minority Provisions:</i></h2>\n<p>Appropriate majority to minority provisions have been adopted by the District.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Transportation:</i></h2>\n<p>The need for transportation in the Junior High, Freshman and High School levels becomes apparent. Some fifty <span class=\"star-pagination\">*150</span> buses owned and operated by the Midland District transport youngsters without cost to them to school if they reside two miles or more from their assigned building. Transportation is also provided for rural youngsters who request it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Staff, Facilities, Curriculum and Special Education Programs:</i></h2>\n<p>The Midland District, as will be shown herein, has been especially proud of the manner in which it has been able to exceed all requirements regarding integration of staff, provision of facilities for its staff and pupils and installment of curriculum and special education programs that are in the best interest of education for those to whom they are furnished.</p>\n<p>The Court further finds that in this plan the School authorities made \"every effort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the practicalities of the situation.\"</p>\n<p>The Court further finds that the racial concentration of Negroes and of Mexican-Americans in the 1968 Plan was not caused by public or private discrimination or state action but by economical factors and decisions of the Negroes and Mexican-Americans to live in their own neighborhood rather than in predominantly White neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>Under the <i>Swann</i> decision and related cases, as stated above judicial power can be invoked only on a showing of discrimination violative of the constitutional standards declared in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, <i>supra</i><i>,</i> and as declared in <i>Swann</i> and in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Board of Education v. Catherine Scott et al., <i>supra,</i> on application to stay order of the Court of Appeals presented to the Chief Justice, \"The Constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole.\"</p>\n<p>A school district has no affirmative obligation to achieve a balance of the races in the schools when the existing imbalance is not attributable to school policies or practices and is a result of the housing patterns and other forces over which the school administration had no control. School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing and solving the problems that have arisen from past <i>de jure</i> segregation.</p>\n<p>The history of the Midland Independent School District does not reveal a deliberate resistance at any time of the Supreme Court's mandate to wipe out the dual system but to the contrary demonstrates desire and attempt to comply with the mandate. This is contrary to the conduct of many school districts which have resisted at every step, during the past 17 years, the court's mandates to set up a uniform system.</p>\n<p>The record of the first hearings revealed complete acceptance by the School District of a unitary system and a desire to eliminate the dual system as promptly and practically as possible.</p>\n<p>The government conceded that the original plan of 1968 would meet all requirements except as to one elementary all black school.</p>\n<p>At the retrial of this case there were submitted two plans by the School Board relating to Negro children and two plans submitted by the Intervenors relating to Negro children, all of which plans were acceptable to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.</p>\n<p>So far as the Negro children are concerned this acceptance by the Health, Education and Welfare Department eliminates any action by the Court other than approving the plan the Board selects. This Court can only intervene in school matters where there is a showing of discrimination violative of the constitutional standards declared in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, <i>supra</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>This Court on reexamination of the record and of the <i>Swann</i> decision and of the opinion of the Chief Justice construing the <i>Swann</i> decision, finds that even the Plan of 1968 did not show discrimination violative of the constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*151</span> standards referred to, nor do any of the four plans submitted, in the opinion of the Court violate any of the constitutional standards declared in Brown I.</p>\n<p>Consequently, this Court can not take over the administrative functions of the School Board and decide which plan should be used.</p>\n<p>\"Judicial interposition in the operation of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and restraint.\"</p>\n<p>\"By and large, public education in our Nation is committed to the control of state and local authorities. Courts do not and cannot intervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school systems and which do not directly and sharply implicate basic constitutional values.\" Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 89 S.Ct. 266, 21 L.Ed.2d 228.</p>\n<p>The School Board has stated that Plan A-2 is its choice and if it is the choice of the School Board this Court can not and will not substitute its personal feelings or preferences. Therefore, the Court will approve Plan A-2, which the School Board seeks to have approved, and direct that same be implemented and put in operation next school term.</p>\n<p>In passing however, the Court would state that if the Court were required or permitted by law to perform the administrative function of selecting a plan from equally constitutional plans, the Court would not close either of the Negro elementary schools but would maintain them to carry out the neighborhood concept.</p>\n<p>The Court commends the Intervenors for the interest shown and help given in this case and personally feels that their neighborhood schools should be left intact, but the failure of the school board to do this does not present a constitutional question. The Court feels that these neighborhood schools are very important to young children in the elementary grades and that it is not necessary in a unitary system and no good can be accomplished by eliminating the neighborhood school and sending young children long distances from their homes. The Court further feels and finds that the maintenance of these two neighborhood schools would in no wise militate against the unitary system of this school district, nor does the Court feel that additional busing of young children is needed to eliminate <i>de jure</i> segregation since there no longer exists <i>de jure</i> segregation. However, all of these are matters that the school board has the responsibility of passing upon and its discretion must be respected so long as its conduct in no wise violates the constitutional standards of Brown I.</p>\n<p>The only question then actually before this Court in so far as the Department of Health, Education and Welfare is concerned, involves the De Zavala Elementary School. It is the position of the Department that this school is a vestige of a past dual system involving Mexican-Americans. The Court does not accept this nor does the record establish this. There has never been any <i>de jure</i> segregation of Mexican-American children and there has never been a dual system involving Mexican-Americans, and the Court so finds and the Court further finds that there has been no showing of any discrimination violative of the constitutional standards declared in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, <i>supra</i><i>,</i> in so far as the Mexican-American children are concerned.</p>\n<p>The Court finds from the evidence that the predominance of Mexican-American children in the De Zavala School was not caused by public or private discrimination or state action but by economic factors and the decision of the Mexican-Americans to live in their own neighborhood rather than in predominantly White neighborhoods and that the school board has acted consistently in good faith in this matter.</p>\n<p>As Texas has never required by law that Mexican-American children be segregated and the Midland Independent School District has never enacted regulations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*152</span> to this effect and from the evidence, the Court finds that there has been no history of discriminatory practices against Mexican-Americans by the school district. \"We are concerned in these cases with elimination of discrimination inherent in dual school systems not with myriad factors of human existence which can cause discrimination in a multitude of ways on racial, religious, or ethnic grounds. The target of the cases from Brown I to the present was the dual school system. The elimination of racial discrimination in public schools is a large task and one that should not be retarded by efforts to achieve broader purposes lying beyond the jurisdiction of school authorities.

The Plan submitted by the Defendant for the entire school district including the elementary schools, is hereby approved, being attached hereto and marked Defendants' Exhibit \"G\" filed in this cause, and this entire Plan shall be fully implemented and in operation by next school term.</p>\n<p>It is further ordered that the school board of the Midland Independent School District shall file semi-annual reports during the school year similar to those required in United States v. Hinds County School Board, 5 Cir. 1970, 433 F.2d 611, 618-619.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BOUNDARY DESCRIPTIONS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Plan A-2</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Bunche Elementary</i></h2>\n<p>Begin at the intersection of Fairground Rd. and Indiana Street, west along Indiana to S.

Beginning with the 1972-1973 school year, all high school transition zones will be phased out. Rural buses will transport high school pupils to Midland High School except for the area north of Midland served by Bus #27. Rural Bus #27 will transport senior high pupils to Lee High School.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Junior High Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<blockquote>The junior high school organizations will be divided structurally and administratively into two sections, (1) Grade 9 and (2) Grades 7 and 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1.

Physical Handicap</h2>\n<blockquote>A physical handicap may make extremely difficult the attendance at the school serving the zone in which the student resides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Illustrative of such handicaps would be: a physical impairment which would make it most difficult or impossible for a pupil to climb stairs to classes on a second floor, a heart condition would be aggravated by climbing stairs or walking long distances to school, or students confined to a wheel chair whose classes would include those scheduled for a second floor. A request for transfer based upon a physical handicap must include a certificate signed by a medical doctor attesting to the extent of the physical handicap.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Admission of a Member of the Family into a Special Education Class at a Special Education Center</h2>\n<blockquote>An illustration of such a situation would be one in which the admission of a member of the family into a special education class would make desirable the admission of another member of the family into that school for purposes of assisting the student assigned to the special education class to get to and from school. Such a transfer request would be approved only if the receiving school had sufficient space to accommodate this student in the class in which he would be enrolled.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Courses Not Offered in the Attendance Zone of Residence</h2>\n<blockquote>Pupils may be transferred from one attendance zone to another if a course desired by the pupil is not offered in the school in the zone of residence but is offered in the school of another zone.

The elimination of racial discrimination in public schools is a large task and one that should not be retarded by efforts to achieve broader purposes lying beyond the jurisdiction of school authorities.

In some circumstances certain schools may remain all or largely of one race until new schools can be provided or neighborhood patterns change. Schools all or predominantly of one race in a district of mixed population will require close scrutiny to determine that school assignments are not part of state-enforced segregation.\"</p>\n<p>\"In light of the above, it should be clear that the existence of some small number of one-race, or virtually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark of a system which still practices segregation by law.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>There have been four plans submitted to this Court, two by the School Board of the Midland Independent School District and two by the Intervenors. The Plaintiff in the case, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, stated that these plans meet the constitutional requirements in so far as they relate to Negro children and the Court agrees with the Plaintiff on this point. Consequently, the decision of this Court is simplified,which plan should be adopted rests entirely in the hands of the school board since this Court can not and would not take over the administrative functions resting in the discretion of school authorities.</p>\n<p>The Defendant School District has stated that it approves the plan referred to as A-2. If it approves this plan and decides to put it into effect it may do so since it does not violate any of the constitutional standards required by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>A different question is presented with regard to Mexican-American children since the record reveals that there has never been any <i>de jure</i> segregation of Mexican-American children, and that there is no evidence showing discrimination violative of the constitutional standards. Consequently, the plan of the Midland Independent School District relating to the De Zavala School is approved. The Plaintiff, Department of Health, Education and Welfare opposes the plan of the School District on this point.</p>\n<p>To give the background of this case, the United States acting through its Department of Health, Education and Welfare, filed its complaint on August 7, 1970, in the Austin Division of the Western District of Texas, including as defendants the Texas Education Agency, the Midland Independent School District and six other school districts in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*149</span> Western District of Texas. Since the Midland Independent School District lies within the Midland-Odessa Division of the Western District of Texas, the case was transferred from Austin to the Midland-Odessa Division and severed from the other defendant school districts which remained in the Austin Division.</p>\n<p>Hearings were held in El Paso, Texas, for pendente lite relief for the 1970-71 school year on August 24 and August 25, 1970. Testimony was presented at that time concerning the proposed plan of the United States and a defense by the School District of its proposed plan for the 1970-71 school year.</p>\n<p>The United States complaint asserted that the school system was operating a dual system based on race and unless restrained by the Court the school district would continue to maintain and operate a dual system in violation of the constitutional rights of the Negro and Mexican-American children. At the hearings in El Paso on August 24 and 25, 1970, the plan of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare was fully developed and the action of the School Board after Brown I to eliminate the previous existing <i>de jure</i> segregation of Negro students was likewise fully developed.</p>\n<p>The record from those hearings established that the School Board of the Midland Independent School District worked diligently with the segregation problem in attempting a desegregation plan which the School Board believed eliminated once and for all all vestiges of the dual system of education. The Court finds that the School Board acted consistently in good faith in preparing its plan in June of 1968 to eliminate all vestiges of the dual system of education in the school district. This plan was as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Midland Plan</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Two High Schools:</i></h2>\n<p>Midland High, fully integrated, is in the center of town and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p>Lee High, fully integrated, is in the northwestern part of town and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Two Freshmen (Ninth Grade) Schools:</i></h2>\n<p>Edison Junior High is in the southeastern part of town, is occupied by ninth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p>Austin Junior High is in the northeastern part of town, is occupied by ninth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Three Seventh and Eighth Grade Junior High Schools:</i></h2>\n<p>Alamo Junior High is in the western part of town, is occupied by seventh and eighth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p>Goddard Junior High is in the northwestern part of town, is occupied by seventh and eighth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p>San Jacinto Junior High is in the west-central part of town, is occupied by seventh and eighth grade students only, is fully integrated and is fed by youngsters of all races and ethnic groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Nineteen Elementary Schools:</i></h2>\n<p>All children of elementary age are assigned to neighborhood schools, each of which and all of which are located within easy-walking distance from the children's homes to which the respective child is assigned. These assignments are made without regard to race and are made strictly on a neighborhood zoning arrangement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Majority to Minority Provisions:</i></h2>\n<p>Appropriate majority to minority provisions have been adopted by the District.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Transportation:</i></h2>\n<p>The need for transportation in the Junior High, Freshman and High School levels becomes apparent. Some fifty <span class=\"star-pagination\">*150</span> buses owned and operated by the Midland District transport youngsters without cost to them to school if they reside two miles or more from their assigned building. Transportation is also provided for rural youngsters who request it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Staff, Facilities, Curriculum and Special Education Programs:</i></h2>\n<p>The Midland District, as will be shown herein, has been especially proud of the manner in which it has been able to exceed all requirements regarding integration of staff, provision of facilities for its staff and pupils and installment of curriculum and special education programs that are in the best interest of education for those to whom they are furnished.</p>\n<p>The Court further finds that in this plan the School authorities made \"every effort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the practicalities of the situation.\"</p>\n<p>The Court further finds that the racial concentration of Negroes and of Mexican-Americans in the 1968 Plan was not caused by public or private discrimination or state action but by economical factors and decisions of the Negroes and Mexican-Americans to live in their own neighborhood rather than in predominantly White neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>Under the <i>Swann</i> decision and related cases, as stated above judicial power can be invoked only on a showing of discrimination violative of the constitutional standards declared in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, <i>supra</i><i>,</i> and as declared in <i>Swann</i> and in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Board of Education v. Catherine Scott et al., <i>supra,</i> on application to stay order of the Court of Appeals presented to the Chief Justice, \"The Constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole.\"</p>\n<p>A school district has no affirmative obligation to achieve a balance of the races in the schools when the existing imbalance is not attributable to school policies or practices and is a result of the housing patterns and other forces over which the school administration had no control. School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing and solving the problems that have arisen from past <i>de jure</i> segregation.</p>\n<p>The history of the Midland Independent School District does not reveal a deliberate resistance at any time of the Supreme Court's mandate to wipe out the dual system but to the contrary demonstrates desire and attempt to comply with the mandate. This is contrary to the conduct of many school districts which have resisted at every step, during the past 17 years, the court's mandates to set up a uniform system.</p>\n<p>The record of the first hearings revealed complete acceptance by the School District of a unitary system and a desire to eliminate the dual system as promptly and practically as possible.</p>\n<p>The government conceded that the original plan of 1968 would meet all requirements except as to one elementary all black school.</p>\n<p>At the retrial of this case there were submitted two plans by the School Board relating to Negro children and two plans submitted by the Intervenors relating to Negro children, all of which plans were acceptable to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.</p>\n<p>So far as the Negro children are concerned this acceptance by the Health, Education and Welfare Department eliminates any action by the Court other than approving the plan the Board selects. This Court can only intervene in school matters where there is a showing of discrimination violative of the constitutional standards declared in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, <i>supra</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>This Court on reexamination of the record and of the <i>Swann</i> decision and of the opinion of the Chief Justice construing the <i>Swann</i> decision, finds that even the Plan of 1968 did not show discrimination violative of the constitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*151</span> standards referred to, nor do any of the four plans submitted, in the opinion of the Court violate any of the constitutional standards declared in Brown I.</p>\n<p>Consequently, this Court can not take over the administrative functions of the School Board and decide which plan should be used.</p>\n<p>\"Judicial interposition in the operation of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and restraint.\"</p>\n<p>\"By and large, public education in our Nation is committed to the control of state and local authorities. Courts do not and cannot intervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school systems and which do not directly and sharply implicate basic constitutional values.\" Epperson v. Arkansas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107793\"><a href=\"/opinion/107793/epperson-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107793\"><a href=\"/opinion/107793/epperson-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The School Board has stated that Plan A-2 is its choice and if it is the choice of the School Board this Court can not and will not substitute its personal feelings or preferences. Therefore, the Court will approve Plan A-2, which the School Board seeks to have approved, and direct that same be implemented and put in operation next school term.</p>\n<p>In passing however, the Court would state that if the Court were required or permitted by law to perform the administrative function of selecting a plan from equally constitutional plans, the Court would not close either of the Negro elementary schools but would maintain them to carry out the neighborhood concept.</p>\n<p>The Court commends the Intervenors for the interest shown and help given in this case and personally feels that their neighborhood schools should be left intact, but the failure of the school board to do this does not present a constitutional question. The Court feels that these neighborhood schools are very important to young children in the elementary grades and that it is not necessary in a unitary system and no good can be accomplished by eliminating the neighborhood school and sending young children long distances from their homes. The Court further feels and finds that the maintenance of these two neighborhood schools would in no wise militate against the unitary system of this school district, nor does the Court feel that additional busing of young children is needed to eliminate <i>de jure</i> segregation since there no longer exists <i>de jure</i> segregation. However, all of these are matters that the school board has the responsibility of passing upon and its discretion must be respected so long as its conduct in no wise violates the constitutional standards of Brown I.</p>\n<p>The only question then actually before this Court in so far as the Department of Health, Education and Welfare is concerned, involves the De Zavala Elementary School. It is the position of the Department that this school is a vestige of a past dual system involving Mexican-Americans. The Court does not accept this nor does the record establish this. There has never been any <i>de jure</i> segregation of Mexican-American children and there has never been a dual system involving Mexican-Americans, and the Court so finds and the Court further finds that there has been no showing of any discrimination violative of the constitutional standards declared in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, <i>supra</i><i>,</i> in so far as the Mexican-American children are concerned.</p>\n<p>The Court finds from the evidence that the predominance of Mexican-American children in the De Zavala School was not caused by public or private discrimination or state action but by economic factors and the decision of the Mexican-Americans to live in their own neighborhood rather than in predominantly White neighborhoods and that the school board has acted consistently in good faith in this matter.</p>\n<p>As Texas has never required by law that Mexican-American children be segregated and the Midland Independent School District has never enacted regulations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*152</span> to this effect and from the evidence, the Court finds that there has been no history of discriminatory practices against Mexican-Americans by the school district. \"We are concerned in these cases with elimination of discrimination inherent in dual school systems not with myriad factors of human existence which can cause discrimination in a multitude of ways on racial, religious, or ethnic grounds. The target of the cases from Brown I to the present was the dual school system.

Physical Handicap</h2>\n<blockquote>A physical handicap may make extremely difficult the attendance at the school serving the zone in which the student resides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Illustrative of such handicaps would be: a physical impairment which would make it most difficult or impossible for a pupil to climb stairs to classes on a second floor, a heart condition would be aggravated by climbing stairs or walking long distances to school, or students confined to a wheel chair whose classes would include those scheduled for a second floor. A request for transfer based upon a physical handicap must include a certificate signed by a medical doctor attesting to the extent of the physical handicap.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Admission of a Member of the Family into a Special Education Class at a Special Education Center</h2>\n<blockquote>An illustration of such a situation would be one in which the admission of a member of the family into a special education class would make desirable the admission of another member of the family into that school for purposes of assisting the student assigned to the special education class to get to and from school. Such a transfer request would be approved only if the receiving school had sufficient space to accommodate this student in the class in which he would be enrolled.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Courses Not Offered in the Attendance Zone of Residence</h2>\n<blockquote>Pupils may be transferred from one attendance zone to another if a course desired by the pupil is not offered in the school in the zone of residence but is offered in the school of another zone. Such transfers shall be rescinded should the pupil complete or withdraw from the course for which the transfer was granted.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Graduating Seniors</h2>\n<blockquote>A transfer may be granted to a pupil who has completed Grade 11 but whose residence has changed before graduation from high school. Such a transfer shall be made only to the school in the pupil's former zone of residence and from which the pupil wishes to graduate.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> IV. <i>Assignment of Professional Personnel, 1971-72.</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Negro-American      Mexican-American    Anglo-American\n  School                                                                 Total\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nElementary\n  Bonham                                                    17.5        17.5\n  Bowie                                                     21.5        21.5\n  Bunche            4                                       13.5        17.5\n  Burnet            2                                       19.5        21.5\n  Crockett          6                       1.5             13          20.5\n  DeZavala                                  7               11.5        18.5\n  Emerson                                                   22.5        22.5\n  Fannin                                                    21.5        21.5\n  Henderson                                                 17          <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>\n  <span class=\"reporter\">Houston</span>           <span class=\"page\">2</span></span>                                       16.5        18.5\n  Jones                                                     19.5        19.5\n  Lamar             1.5                      .5             16.5        18.5\n  Long                                        1             26.5        27.5\n  Milam             3.5                                     16.5        20\n  Pease             2.5                                     15.5        18\n  Rusk                                                      21.5        21.5\n  South             3                                       21.5        24.5\n  Travis            3                                       19          22\n  West               .5                                     13          13.5\nSecondary\n  Alamo             6                       2               35          43\n  Goddard           2.5                     2               45.5        50\n  San Jacinto       6                       4               31          41\n  Austin            6.5                     1               45.5        53\n  Edison            5                       2               31          38\n  Lee               5                       2              104         111\n  Midland           5                       2               98.5       105.5\n                  ======                  =====            =====       =====\n                   64                      25              734         823\n</pre>\n</div>",
