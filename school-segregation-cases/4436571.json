Archer, David R.\n                          Archer, Carol Archer Bugg, John V. Archer, Karen Archer\n                          Ball, and Sherri Archer sued Ted M. Anderson and others\n                          for their actions that caused Appellees’ uncle, John R.\n                          “Jack” Archer, to sign numerous estate planning\n                          documents that disinherited the Archers. Jack signed all\n                          of the disinheriting estate planning documents after a\n                          stroke that rendered him mentally incapacitated. Ted died\n                          during the litigation, and the co-executors of his estate\n                          substituted as defendants.\n\nTrial court disposition: After a week and a half trial, the jury returned a verdict\n                         finding that Ted had tortiously interfered with the Archers’\n                         inheritance and awarded $2,006,150 in damages.

Archer, David R. Archer, Carol\n\nArcher Bugg, John V. Archer, Karen Archer Ball, and Sherri Archer (“the Archers”)\n\nfile their Appellees/Cross-Appellants’ Brief requesting that the Court affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s Final Judgment on liability. By cross-issue, the Archers request that\n\nthe Court modify and render judgment awarding them their the total damages proved\n\nas a matter of law. Alternatively, the Archers seek affirmance of the Final Judgment\n\non liability and damages\n\n                                 INTRODUCTION\n\n      In this tortious interference with inheritance rights case, the Archers seek to\n\nrecover the attorney’s fees and other monies they were forced to pay in litigation\n\ninvolving their uncle, Jack Archer. Jack’s life-long estate plan left the bulk of his\n\nmore than $7.5 million estate to his nearest relatives, the Archers. Ted Anderson,\n\nhowever, had other plans for Jack’s estate. Shortly after Jack suffered a catastrophic\n\nstroke that rendered Jack mentally incapacitated, Ted Anderson obtained a power of\n\nattorney from Jack and assembled and instructed a team of attorneys to rewrite and\n\ncause Jack to sign three new wills, two trusts, and numerous property assignments.\n\nThe new estate planning documents not only disinherited the Archers and left Jack’s\n\nentire estate to charities, but also made a will contest virtually impossible.\n\f      Ted and his cohorts forced the Archers into costly and protracted legal\n\nwranglings in a guardianship proceeding and related lawsuits that lasted more than\n\n5 years and cost the Archers more than $3.4 million to reverse.\n\n      In the end, the Archers successfully reinstated Jack’s original estate plan and\n\ninherited Jack’s estate. Having successfully restored their inheritance from their\n\nuncle, the Archers brought the underlying tortious interference with inheritance\n\nlawsuit to recover the more than $3.4 million in attorney’s fees and other monies\n\npaid in the guardianship litigation as damages.\n\n      After an eight-day trial, the jury found that Ted tortiously interfered with the\n\nArchers’ inheritance and awarded $2,006,100 in damages. In post-verdict motions,\n\nAppellants conceded that the Archers proved more damages than the jury awarded.\n\nAs a result, the district court’s Final Judgment awarded $588,054, as conceded by\n\nAppellants, in addition to the jury’s verdict. The district court, however, did not\n\ngrant the Archers’ post-verdict motion seeking all of the damages they proved as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n      The Archers seek an affirmance of the Final Judgment on liability and by\n\ncross-issue seek a modification and rendition of judgment on the total amount of\n\ndamages that were proved as a matter of law. Alternatively, the Archers seek\n\naffirmance of the Final Judgment on liability and damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                                    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n          The Archer Family. John R. “Jack” Archer lived in Corpus Christi, but spent\n\nconsiderable amounts of time on his 1000-acre ranch in Blanco County. 3RR84-85.\n\nJack was very successful in the oil and gas business and amassed an estate worth\n\nmore than $7.5 million. 3RR78, 88; 11RRPlx28, Plx29; 12RRPlx241.1 In addition\n\nto his home in Corpus and his ranch, Jack owned a house in Ireland, an airplane, a\n\nlarge coin collection, a collection of valuable jewels, and bank accounts located all\n\nover the world. 3RR85-86, 172-73.\n\n          Jack was married four times, but was single when he died. 3RR78-79. He\n\nhad no children. 3RR78-79. Jack’s nearest relatives were his only brother, Richard\n\nT. Archer, and Richard’s six children: Michael, John, David, Carol, Sherri, and\n\nKaren. 2\n\n          The Archer family was close-knit. For more than twenty years before Jack’s\n\nstroke, Jack and Richard’s family spent the majority of holidays together either at\n\nJack’s ranch, at his home in Corpus, or at Richard’s home in Tyler. 3RR77-78, 83-\n\n84; 4RR70. Jack remained close to the Archer children’s mother, Joanne, even after\n\nshe and Richard divorced. 3RR84; 4RR70.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 241 is not in numerical order in the Reporter’s Record. App. C. It is found before\nPlx222.\n2\n    Richard died while this lawsuit was pending.\n                                                   3\n\f          The Archer children were also very close to their Uncle Jack. 3RR83-84. Jack\n\nconsidered the Archer children as “part his children.” 4RR71. Similarly, the Archer\n\nchildren saw their Uncle Jack as a second father. 3RR88. Each Archer child had\n\nparticular activities they enjoyed doing with Uncle Jack. 3RR83-84. The Archer\n\nchildren always knew that Jack wanted the ranch to stay in the family. 3RR103.\n\nAppellant Ted Anderson admitted that Jack “really liked his nieces and nephews.”\n\n7RR60.\n\n          Jack and Richard established a trust for the Archer children, known as the\n\n“ADI Trust.” 3RR89-90, 94-95; 11RRPlx3. Richard was the trustee of the ADI\n\nTrust and the Archer children were the beneficiaries. 3RR89, 95. The Archer\n\nchildren did not receive regular distributions from the trust. 3RR89. Instead, the\n\ntrust was used for significant expenses such as college tuition or down payments on\n\nhouses when the Archer children became adults. 3RR89-90.3\n\n          Jack’s life-long estate plan: Jack’s fondness for his brother and his nieces\n\nand nephews was reflected in his estate planning. In his 1991 Last Will and\n\nTestament, Jack left the bulk of his estate, including his ranch, to Richard and\n\nRichard’s six children, five of whom are Appellees/Cross-Appellants in this case.4\n\n\n\n3\n    Attached as Appendix D is a timeline of Events. 12RRPlx233. App. D.\n4\n    Michael Archer is not a party to this case. 3RR74-75.\n\n\n\n                                                      4\n\f3RR99-100, 101; 11RRPlx9 at 2-3 (“1991 Will”). Jack’s 1991 Will also designated\n\ntwelve charities to split sixty percent of his mineral interests.      3RR100-01;\n\n11RRPlx9 at 9. The 1991 Will named Richard as executor. 11RRPlx9 at 4. Jack\n\nalso named Richard as primary beneficiary of his life insurance policies and bank\n\naccounts. 3RR92-93; 11RRPlx2, Plx4-6, Plx8.\n\n      Jack’s stroke. On August 25, 1998, at the age of 71, Jack suffered a\n\ndebilitating, large right hemisphere stroke, leaving him physically impaired and\n\nmentally incapacitated.   4RR148; 11RRPlx39 at PLF089274, Plx88.           Medical\n\nexperts described the stroke as “very severe,” “very significant,” and one that left\n\nJack “very impaired.” 4RR148, 159, 227. After his stroke, Jack remained in the\n\nhospital for three weeks and then went to a rehab hospital before returning to his\n\nhome. 3RR108; 11RRPlx39.\n\n      Following Jack’s stroke, Richard and the Archer children went to Corpus\n\nChristi to assist with Jack’s care. 3RR105-06. Richard went to Corpus Christi to\n\ncare for Jack seventeen times from the date of his stroke until the early summer of\n\n1999. 7RR85; 11RRPlx10. Richard had Jack’s house modified, obtained a van to\n\ntransport him, and found caregivers for Jack.        3RR106, 110, 111; 7RR85;\n\n11RRPlx11. The Archer children also went to Corpus Christi to help in the months\n\nafter Jack’s stroke. 3RR106, 110.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      Ted Anderson initiates process to disinherit the Archers. Within weeks\n\nafter Jack’s stroke, Ted Anderson began a series of actions that caused Jack to sign\n\nnew estate planning documents that disinherited the Archers.\n\n      First, on September 24, 1998, while Jack was still in the rehab hospital after\n\nhis stroke, Ted, who was an attorney, drafted and caused Jack to sign two powers of\n\nattorney. 6RR103; 7RR52, 64; 11RRPlx139, Plx140, Plx148. The durable power\n\nof attorney designated Ted as Jack’s attorney-in-fact with very broad powers.\n\n11RRPlx139. The medical power of attorney gave Ted the power to make medical\n\ndecisions for Jack. 6RR109, 111; 11RRPlx140.\n\n      Ted later claimed to never have needed the durable power of attorney.\n\nAccording to Ted, “I really haven’t had to use it. Jack signed everything we needed\n\nsigned.” 7RR55; 11RRPlx112 at 25. Ted, however, regularly used the medical\n\npower of attorney to communicate with Jack’s doctors. 11RRPlx53, Plx54, Plx67.\n\n      On the day Jack signed the powers of attorney, Jack had reported to the health\n\ncare providers that he had been working at this ranch in Blanco all day and that he\n\nhad not spent the night in the hospital. 6RR104; 11RRPlx43 at PLF083957. Neither\n\nof Jack’s statements was true. Medical evidence also showed that, soon after he\n\nsigned the powers of attorney, Jack expressed confusion about the documents he had\n\nsigned. 4RR201-202; 11RRPlx43 at PLF083938.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f      One of the Archers’ medical experts opined, that based on the severity of his\n\nstroke as reflected in the medical records dated September 24, 1998, Jack did not\n\nhave capacity. 4RR200. Further, Appellee Carol Archer Bugg visited her uncle\n\nwhile he was in the rehab hospital and observed that Jack was not in any condition\n\nto make decisions on his own. 3RR110.\n\n      In December 1998, Ted obtained the original of Jack’s 1991 Will from the\n\nattorney who drafted it. 6RR111-12; 11RRPlx141. Ted then made his first attempt\n\nto disinherit the Archers. In early 1999, Ted tried to get Jack to place 600 acres of\n\nhis ranch in a charitable remainder trust. 6RR122-24; 11RRPlx145. Putting Jack’s\n\nranch into a charitable remainder trust would have disinherited the Archers.\n\n6RR132. Jack, however, managed to communicate to Ted that he did not want to\n\nsell the ranch. 11RRPlx145.\n\n      Ted also began alienating the Archer family from Jack. By early 1999, the\n\nArchers’ access to Jack was being limited. 3RR127. In February 1999, Jack\n\npurportedly typed and signed a letter to Richard asking Richard not to visit him.\n\n11RRPlx51. Jack, however, never told Richard not to visit. 7RR82-83. Expert\n\ntestimony indicated the signature on the letter was not Jack’s and, moreover that,\n\nafter his stroke, Jack could not have been able to type. 4RR203-04; 11RRPlx44.\n\nThe Archers’ phone calls to Jack were not returned. 3RR129. They received no\n\ninformation on his medical condition during the spring of 1999. Id. The Archers\n\n\n                                         7\n\falso discovered that the caregivers Richard hired had been fired. 7RR85. By the\n\nend of the summer of 1999, the Archer family did not know where Jack was living.\n\n3RR136. The Archers even hired a private investigator to locate Jack, but to no avail.\n\n3RR137.\n\n      Meanwhile, Ted continued his scheming. Ted hired two estate planning\n\nattorneys, Buster Adami and Richard Leshin, to assist him in changing Jack’s estate\n\nplan. 6RR110-11, 127; 11RRPlx142, Plx143, Plx146.              In June 1999, Adami\n\nprepared a codicil to Jack’s 1991 Will that added J.R. Hamilton and T. Mark\n\nAnderson along with Richard as co-executors of Jack’s estate. 11RRPlx147. The\n\ncodicil required the three co-executors to act jointly or by majority. Id. In July 1999,\n\nanticipating that the Archers might file a guardianship proceeding, Adami wrote the\n\nNueces County judges informing them that Jack was managing his affairs through\n\nTed and encouraging them to not grant an ex parte guardianship. 11RRPlx150. As\n\ndetailed below, at Ted’s direction, Leshin prepared the post-stroke wills and trusts\n\nthat disinherited the Archers. 6RR120.\n\n      Ted’s efforts to disinherit the Archers by having Jack sell his ranch to charities\n\ncontinued. This time, however, Ted enlisted his recently hired estate planning\n\nattorneys, Leshin and Adami, to pressure Jack to sell. 6RR128-32; 11RRPlx151;\n\nApp. E. In July 1999, Ted wrote Adami about getting Jack to put his ranch in a\n\nfoundation for the benefit of the charities. 11RRPlx151. Ted wrote, “[h]e [Jack]\n\n\n                                           8\n\fmay switch and turn but I hope that we can continue to encourage him in this\n\ndirection and since Richard [Leshin] helped me with the limited partnership for the\n\nranch Jack might feel comfortable with suggestions from Richard [Leshin].”\n\n11RRPlx 151. Ted’s letter goes on to speculate about the size of Jack’s estate being\n\nat $3 million.\n\n      Ted surrendered his law license in June 1999. 11RRPlx148. He resigned as\n\nJack’s attorney-in-fact in November 1999. 11RRPlx153. Neither event, however,\n\nlimited Ted’s actions.\n\n        The Archers seek legal advice: Concerned for Jack’s well-being when they\n\ncould not locate Jack or find out his condition, the Archers sought legal advice.\n\n3RR132-33. In October 1999, the law firm of Ikard & Golden filed an application\n\nfor temporary guardian in Blanco County and got Richard appointed as temporary\n\nguardian of Jack’s person and estate. 3RR140; 11RRPlx14-16. Richard made it\n\nclear, however, that he did not want serve as permanent guardian of Jack’s estate;\n\nrather, he wanted a third party as permanent guardian. 7RR86-87; 11RRPlx20.\n\n      On December 29, 1999, a hearing was held on the Archers’ temporary\n\nguardianship application in Blanco County. 11RRPlx155. Attorneys from four law\n\nfirms, including Adami and Leshin, along with a court-appointed attorney ad litem,\n\nrepresented Jack at the hearing. 11RRPlx155 at 3. In response to the Archers’\n\nrequest for Jack to testify regarding his wishes, all five of Jack’s attorneys agreed on\n\n\n                                           9\n\fthe record that Jack needed a guardian of his person and his estate. 6RR139-40;\n\n11RRPlx155 at 15-23.\n\n      The agreement for a temporary guardianship meant that all of Jack’s attorneys\n\nagreed that Jack lacked the mental and physical capabilities to care for himself and\n\nto manage his own affairs. 6RR140-42; 11RRPlx160. Seemingly, the matter was\n\nresolved.\n\n      Ted continued his plan to disinherit the Archers. Despite the agreement\n\nfor a temporary guardian, and despite his resignation as Jack’s attorney-in-fact under\n\nthe power of attorney, Ted continued to seek to change Jack’s estate plan. 6RR135.\n\n      In early January 2000, Ted sought Leshin’s advice on Jack’s estate planning,\n\nand in particular, on how to avoid a future guardianship. 11RRPlx154, Plx157.\n\nLeshin advised that any estate planning would have to wait until Jack was no longer\n\nsubject of a guardianship proceeding. 6RR143; 11RRPlx157. Leshin also advised\n\nTed on a scheme that “will make a contest of the disposition of [Jack’s] assets more\n\ndifficult.” 11RRPlx157. According to Leshin, if the temporary guardianship over\n\nJack were dismissed, Jack’s assets could be transferred to a revocable trust to avoid\n\na future guardianship and court supervision. 6RR136-37; 11RRPlx154. Jack was\n\nnot copied on any of Leshin’s estate planning letters. 11RRPlx154, Plx157.\n\n      To effectuate the estate plan Leshin concocted, on March 16, 2000, Ted fired\n\nall of the attorneys who represented Jack in the Blanco County guardianship who\n\n\n                                         10\n\fhad agreed Jack needed a guardian. 6RR149-50; 11RRPlx162. Ted hired a trial\n\nattorney, Doug Hearne, Sr., who repudiated the agreement that Jack needed a\n\ntemporary guardianship. 6RR159; 12RRPlx216, Plx217.\n\n      March 2000 Will. On the same day he fired Jack’s attorneys, Ted sent Jack’s\n\n1991 Will to Leshin. 6RR74; 11RRPlx163. On March 19, 2000, Jack signed the\n\nMarch 2000 Will that Leshin drafted that left all of Jack’s assets to charities, entirely\n\ndisinheriting the Archers.       6RR151; 11RRPlx166.          The March 2000 Will\n\ncontemplated that a trust would be established to hold Jack’s assets, but that, if the\n\ntrust were not set up before Jack died, all of his assets would go to the charities.\n\n11RRPlx166 at 1. Jack did not read the will before signing it; Leshin read it to him\n\nat the will signing. 7RR30.\n\n      April 2000 Will. Soon after Jack signed the March 2000 Will, Ted directed\n\nLeshin to prepare another will and a trust. 7RR32-33; 11RRPlx170. On April 26,\n\n2000, Jack signed the April 2000 Will, the Jack Archer Trust Indenture (“Trust”),\n\nand several property assignments that transferred all of Jack’s assets into the Trust.\n\n6RR153-54; 11RRPlx171-76. The Trust was to terminate on Jack’s death and its\n\nassets to be distributed among that the twelve named charities. 11RRPlx171 at 2-3.\n\nTed, who was no longer licensed to practice law, explained the Trust and had Jack\n\nsign the Trust before Leshin arrived at the will signing. 11RRPlx177. According to\n\nLeshin, one of the purposes of the April 2000 Will was to make a will contest even\n\n\n                                           11\n\fmore difficult for the Archers, by increasing the number of wills to challenge.\n\n7RR39; 11RRPlx177.\n\n      For the March 2000 Will, the April 2000 Will, and the Trust, Leshin received\n\nall of his instruction for the document’s terms from Ted. 7RR27-28, 32, 36-38, 41-\n\n42; 11RRPlx165, Plx167. Leshin never talked to Jack about the documents until the\n\nsignings. Id. Ted decided when Jack would sign documents and was present for\n\nevery signing. 6RR95-96, 156; 7RR43; 11RRPlx167.\n\n      Although he represented Jack for three years, Leshin never had a phone\n\nconversation with Jack or had any written correspondence with him. 7RR26-27.\n\nLeshin’s file and billing records confirmed that his only communications on Jack’s\n\nmatter were with Ted. 6RR113-14, 118-20, 135; 11RRPlx142, Plx144, Plx149,\n\nPlx152, Plx158, Plx161, Plx169, Plx182, Plx184-87, Plx191, Plx195, Plx196. On\n\nthe occasions when Leshin met with Jack, Ted was always present. 7RR26.\n\n      Although Ted was Leshin’s source of information on Jack, Leshin did not\n\nknow that Jack had had a stroke. 7RR20. Leshin made no assessment of Jack’s\n\ncapacity when Jack signed the estate planning documents.         6RR158; 7RR37.\n\nInstead, Leshin relied solely on Ted’s representations regarding Jack’s capacity.\n\n7RR21, 37.\n\n      Contrary to Leshin’s testimony that Ted orchestrated all of Jack’s post-stroke\n\nwills, and that the records showed that Ted’s name was “all over everything,” Ted\n\n\n                                        12\n\fcontended that he had nothing to do with the wills. 6RR71-73, 61; 7RR63. When\n\npressed in his deposition about his involvement, Ted refused to answer the questions.\n\n7RR67-68.\n\n      In May 2000, Jack signed a new durable power of attorney and medical power\n\nof attorney naming Ted as attorney-in-fact and specifically disqualified the Archer\n\nfamily from serving. 6RR159-60; 11RRPlx179, Plx180.\n\n      Jack’s medical condition around the 2000 will signings. Jack signed the\n\nMarch 2000 Will on March 19, 2000, and the April 2000 Will and Trust on April\n\n26, 2000. 11RRPlx166, Plx171-76. Jack was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric\n\nhospital from March 28 through April 19, 2000. 7RR33; 11RRPlx71-74. The\n\npsychiatric hospital notes described Jack’s symptoms as “delusional paranoia” and\n\nbeing “oriented to person only.” 11RRPlx73 at PLF069710, Plx74 at PLF069715.\n\nWhile in the psychiatric hospital, Jack reported (incorrectly) that the year was 1928,\n\nthat he was in his thirties, that his parents were still living, and that he was in Ohio.\n\n11RRPlx71 at PLF038490. The psychiatric hospital notes are replete with entries\n\ndescribing Jack as confused, disoriented, and having delusional and suicidal\n\nthoughts. 11RRPlx71 at PLF038490, PLF038492, PLF038493, PLF038494. One of\n\nJack’s doctors, Dr. Still, opined that Jack was incapacitated in May 2000. 7RR88-\n\n89.\n\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\f      Jack was again admitted to a psychiatric hospital in June 2000. 11RRPlx81,\n\n82. The records are filled with statements that Jack was suffering from paranoia,\n\nconfusion, disorientation, and having delusional thoughts.           11RRPlx82 at\n\nPLF064633, PLF 064634, PLF064637, PLF064638.\n\n      Leshin testified that he did not know that Jack was admitted to a psychiatric\n\nhospital for delusions and paranoia only nine days after signing the March 2000 Will.\n\n7RR31, 35-36. Further, when Jack signed the new estate planning documents in\n\nMarch and April of 2000, Jack had had no contact with his family and was only\n\naround Ted Anderson and Pam Rucker, a former girlfriend. 3RR153-54.\n\n      Bexar County Guardianship and related litigation. By repudiating the\n\nBlanco County temporary guardianship, Ted forced the Archers to file a new\n\nguardianship proceeding. 11RRPlx18. In May 2000, David Archer and Carol\n\nArcher Bugg filed the Bexar County guardianship proceeding, seeking an\n\nindependent person as guardian of Jack’s estate and person.             3RR144-46;\n\n11RRPlx18. Jack’s attorneys contested the guardianship, contending Jack was\n\ncompetent and did not need a guardianship. 3RR147.\n\n      While the Bexar County guardianship was pending, the Archers discovered\n\nfor the first time, that they had been disinherited and that the several people had\n\ntaken money from Jack since his stroke. 6RR23; 11RRPlx21, 12RRPlx218. In\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fparticular, the Archers learned that the attorneys Ted hired were being paid from\n\nJack’s assets without court approval. 7RR106; 11RRPlx21.\n\n      Medical evidence detailed impact of Jack’s stroke. During the guardianship\n\nproceeding, the Archers also learned about the extent of Jack’s medical condition.\n\n      In addition to the psychiatric hospital records, Jack’s medical records\n\nchronicled the severe impact that his August 1998 stroke had on his mental capacity.\n\nOne of Jack’s treating physicians, Dr. Faulk, wrote in November 1999 that Jack was\n\n“obviously unable to control his estate in his current condition, and will require\n\nassistance in having his wishes carried through.” 11RRPlx68. A court-appointed\n\ndoctor, Dr. Lichtenstein, who examined Jack in September 2000, reported that Jack’s\n\nstroke rendered him mentally and physically incapacitated and in need of a guardian.\n\n11RRPlx88. Dr. Lichtenstein examined Jack again in June 2001 and reaffirmed his\n\nearlier opinion. 11RRPlx104. Dr. Still testified that in May 2001 Jack was not able\n\nto speak. 7RR91. Dr. Faulk, opined in June 2001 that Jack was “incapacitated to\n\nhandle any of his affairs” “by any standard medical or legal.” 11RRPlx105. Jack’s\n\nin-chambers interview with the Bexar County probate judge in January 2001 and his\n\nJuly 2001 deposition further demonstrated Jack’s severely diminished capacity.\n\n4RR220-21; 11RRPlx27, 11RRPlx93 at 61-86.\n\n      The Archers’ medical expert witnesses, Dr. Richard Coons and Dr. William\n\nDailey, both opined that Jack was incapacitated and in need of a guardian from the\n\n\n                                        15\n\fdate of his stroke in August 1998 onward.          4RR200, 248-49; 5RR109-10;\n\n11RRPlx105. Dr. Dailey testified that Jack’s lack of mental capacity would have\n\nbeen obvious to lay people who came in contact with Jack. 4RR276.\n\n      Probate court appoints temporary guardians. The probate court appointed\n\nPam Rucker, Jack’s former girlfriend, as temporary guardian of his person.\n\n11RRPlx189. As temporary guardian, Pam refused to allow the Archers to visit Jack\n\nand forced the family to seek court-ordered visitation to see their uncle. 3RR151;\n\n7RR120-21.\n\n      The probate court appointed J.R. Hamilton as temporary guardian of Jack’s\n\nestate. 11RRPlx190. Hamilton’s April 2001 accounting listed Jack as having no\n\nassets, and that all of his assets were held in trust. 12RRPlx218. The accounting\n\ngave the Archers their first indication that they had been disinherited. 3RR149;\n\n12RRPlx218.\n\n      May 2001 Will. While the Bexar County guardianship proceeding was\n\npending, Ted had Jack sign another will and an amendment to the Trust.\n\n11RRPlx192, Plx194. The May 2001 Will and the trust amendment removed\n\nHamilton as executor and successor trustee, and replaced him with Ted’s son, T.\n\nMark Anderson.       6RR160-61; 11RRPlx192, Plx194.          Jack signed another\n\nguardianship directive that disqualified the Archer family from serving as guardian.\n\n11RRPlx193.\n\n\n                                        16\n\f      Archers change their attorney’s fees agreement. After learning that they had\n\nbeen disinherited, the Archers changed their attorney’s fee arrangement with their\n\nlaw firm from hourly to a contingent fee in November 2001.                  6RR22. The\n\ncontingency fee was based on getting the Archers reinstated as beneficiaries. It\n\nreinstated, the law firm would receive a percentage of the value of Jack’s estate,\n\nincluding monies brought into Jack’s guardianship estate through lawsuits against\n\nTed and the attorneys he had hired. 6RR23-26; 11RRPlx22 at 2-3.\n\n      Lawsuits filed in the Bexar County guardianship. The Archers filed\n\nseveral lawsuits within the guardianship to challenge the validity of the Trust and to\n\ntry to recover the hundreds of thousands of dollars that had been taken from Jack\n\nsince his stroke. 3RR154-55; 4RR38-39.\n\n      Lawsuit over the validity of the Trust and settlement with the charities. The\n\nexistence of competing wills – one leaving Jack’s estate to the Archers and three\n\nwills and a trust leaving Jack’s entire estate to the charities – set the stage for a will\n\ncontest. 6RR64-65, 68-69. Rather than pursue a costly, contentious will contest, the\n\nArchers filed a declaratory judgment action to determine the validity of the Trusts\n\nwhile Jack was still alive. 3RR157-58; 6RR70-71; 11RRPlx23.                  Contrary to\n\nAppellants’ assertion, the Archers did not “sue the Christian Charities.” Appts. Br.\n\nat 14. As named beneficiaries in the Trust, the charities were necessary parties to the\n\ndeclaratory judgment action. 6RR62-63.\n\n\n                                           17\n\f      Lawsuits against parties who had wrongfully taken money from Jack: The\n\nArchers filed three lawsuits against individuals who had taken advantage of Jack\n\nafter his stroke. These lawsuits were filed in November 2001 by Appellee Sherri\n\nArcher Loveday, derivatively on Jack and his guardianship estate’s behalf, against\n\nthe following defendants 3RR154-55; 4RR38-39; 7RR121-22:\n\n      1)     Hearne Sr., Leshin, Adami, and Anderson for legal malpractice\n             12RRDx12;\n\n      2)     Ted Anderson and Pam Rucker for breach of fiduciary duty and for\n             intentional infliction of emotional distress 12RRDx13; and\n\n      3)     J.R. Hamilton, as temporary guardian of Jack’s estate, and the bond\n             company for breach of duty by failing to obtain court approval of\n             expenses and for paying expenses from Jack’s trust 7RR117-18, 123;\n             12RRDx14.\n\n      Lawsuit for tortious interference with inheritance. The Archers also filed a\n\nlawsuit for tortious interference with inheritance against Ted, Hearne Sr., and Leshin\n\nin February 2003. CR98-117. The probate court abated the lawsuit until after Jack\n\ndied because generally, a tortious interference with inheritance claim does not ripen\n\nuntil death. 6RR15-17.\n\n      Contrary to Appellants’ characterization, the Archers were very successful in\n\nthe Bexar County guardianship and related litigation. Appts. Br. at 10. First, as a\n\nresult of the lawsuit against Pam Rucker, she resigned as guardian, and the probate\n\ncourt appointed Appellee Carol Archer Bugg as Jack’s permanent guardian of the\n\nperson.; 3RR164-6; 7RR123-24; 11RRPlx25. The Archers also got J.R. Hamilton\n                                         18\n\fremoved as temporary guardian of Jack’s estate. 7RR117-18, 120. The probate\n\ncourt granted the Archers’ request for an independent guardian of the estate and\n\nappointed Robert McIntyre as guardian of Jack’s estate. 3RR166; 7RR102-03;\n\n12RRPlx240.\n\n       Second, by challenging the validity of the post-stroke Trust and settling with\n\nthe charities, the Archers nullified the estate-planning documents that Ted, and\n\nothers working with Ted, had Jack sign that disinherited the family. 7RR102-03.\n\nThe Archers and the charities reached a settlement before Jack died and thus,\n\navoided a will contest. 4RR35-36; 11RRPlx23. The charities agreed to not file\n\nJack’s post-stroke wills for probate, leaving Jack’s 1991 Will in place. 11RRPlx23\n\nat 9-13. The Archers had to give much more to the charities than Jack’s 1991 will\n\nleft to the charities. The Archers paid the twelve designated charities $588,054 over\n\nand above what Jack’s 1991 Will left them. 3RR159-61; 11RRPlx24, Plx30,\n\n12RRPlx2415.\n\n       Finally, the lawsuits filed against Hearne Sr., Adami, and Hamilton resulted\n\nin hundreds of thousands of dollars being returned to Jack’s guardianship estate in\n\nsettlements with. 6RR60-62; 12RRPlx241.\n\n\n\n\n5\n Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 241 is not in numerical order in the Reporter’s Record.

As a result of the Archers’ efforts, Jack returned\n\nto living on his ranch, near his brother Richard. 7RR102-03. Carol remained his\n\nguardian for the rest of his life. 3RR166-68. Jack was never put in a psychiatric\n\nhospital after Carol became his guardian. 3RR168. After the Archers moved Jack\n\nback to his ranch, Jack never heard from Ted. 3RR169.\n\n      Jack died on April 17, 2006. 3RR170; 11RRPlx28. Jack’s 1991 Will was\n\nprobated and the Archers received the inheritance Jack intended for them to have.\n\n3RR174; 11RRPlx27, Plx36. Regaining their inheritance, however, came at a\n\nsignificant monetary cost.\n\n      The Travis County case. In the underlying lawsuit here, the Archers sought\n\nthe difference between what they actually received from Jack’s estate and what they\n\nwould have received had Ted not tortiously interfered. CR654-710. The Archers\n\nsought as damages the amount paid to get themselves reinstated as beneficiaries: 1)\n\ntheir attorney’s fees paid in the Bexar County litigation of $2,865,928 and 2) the\n\namount paid to settle with the charities of $588,054, for a total of $3,453,982.\n\n6RR79; 7RR102-03; 12RRPlx241. App. C.\n\n      The Archers originally brought the tortious interference lawsuit in the Bexar\n\nCounty guardianship.     Once Jack died, the Bexar County probate court lost\n\njurisdiction over the tortious interference lawsuit and dismissed it. 6RR15-16. The\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f   Archers then refiled in Travis County based on defendant Doug Hearne Sr.’s\n\n   residence in Travis County. 6RR15-17; CR5-25.\n\n         Ted died on March 28, 2006, while this lawsuit was pending. T. Mark\n\n   Anderson and Christine Anderson, the Co-Executors of Ted M. Anderson’s Estate,\n\n   substituted as defendants.\n\n         May 2013 trial. After settlements with Leshin and Hearne Sr.’s estate, the\n\n   Archers proceeded to trial on May 13, 2013 against T. Mark Anderson and Christine\n\n   Anderson, as co-executors of Ted’s estate. On May 23, the jury returned its verdict\n\n   and found that Ted tortiously interfered with the Archers’ inheritance. Appellants\n\n   do not dispute this finding on appeal.

Appellants have waived in\n\nthe district court or in their brief on appeal at least some part of their argument under\n\neach issue.\n\n       The jury found that Ted tortiously interfered with the Archers’ inheritance.\n\nThat fact finding is not challenged on appeal. Instead, Appellants contend that Ted’s\n\ntortious conduct is not actionable. Contrary to Appellants’ argument, Texas law has\n\nlong recognized a cause of action for tortious interference with inheritance when a\n\nperson by fraud, duress, or other tortious means prevents another person from\n\nreceiving an inheritance from a third party that she would otherwise have received.\n\n       The district court correctly awarded the Archers their attorney’s fees incurred\n\nin prior litigation as a result of Ted’s tortious conduct as damages. As Texas\n\nSupreme Court precedent holds, attorney’s fees and litigation expenses incurred in\n\nprior litigation with a third party are recoverable as actual damages.\n\n       In addition to their attorney’s fees, the district court properly awarded an\n\nadditional $588,054 to jury’s verdict of $2,006,150. Appellants conceded in their\n\npost-verdict motions that the Archers established the $588,054 as the amount paid\n\nto settle with the charities.\n\n       Finally, the district court properly calculated prejudgment interest. Well-\n\nestablished law prohibits tolling of prejudgment interest as argued by Appellants.\n\n\n                                           23\n\f        By cross issue, the Archers seek the entire amount of their attorney’s fees paid\n\nin the prior litigation that were proved as a matter of law. Appellants offered no\n\nevidence or expert witness to controvert the Archers’ attorney’s fees evidence.\n\n        For these reasons and those set out below, the district court correctly signed a\n\nfinal judgment on liability. The Archers request modification and rendition of\n\njudgment on their full damages proved as a matter of law. Alternatively, the Archers\n\nrequest the Court affirm the Final Judgment on liability and damages.\n\n                            ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nI.      The Archers followed well-established Texas law when they sued Ted\n        Anderson for tortious interference with their inheritance. [Responsive to\n        Issue 1]\n\n        Appellants do not challenge, and thus concede, that Ted tortiously interfered\n\nwith the Archers’ inheritance. Appellants urge this Court to conclude, however, that\n\nthere is no cause of action for tortious interference with inheritance. Appellants’\n\nbriefing error waives this Court’s review. Even considering Appellants’ waived\n\nargument, Texas law has long recognize tortious interference with inheritance as a\n\ncause of action.6\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Appellants only filed a general denial. CR62-65. Appellants raised the affirmative defense of whether\ntortious interference with inheritance is a recognized cause of action for the first time in their amended\nmotion for partial JNOV filed July 25, 2013, more than two months after the verdict. CR1264-1275. App.\nJ.\n\n\n                                                   24\n\f      A.     Appellants’ briefing error waives Issue 1.\n\n      According to Appellants, 1) Texas law does not recognize a cause of action\n\nfor tortious interference with inheritance, and 2) if the tort exists, it does not apply\n\nto attorneys. Appellants have waived both arguments.\n\n      In support of their first argument, Appellants cite no authority for their\n\ncontention that tortious interference with inheritance does not exist. TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1(i). Their only authorities cited—King v. Acker and Meduna v. Holder—\n\ndemonstrate that the tort does exist. Appellants make no argument to distinguish\n\nthese and other controlling authority. Appts. Br. at 21. Marin Real Estate Partners,\n\nL.P. v. Vogt, 373 S.W.3d 57, 81 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011, no pet.). Thus, this\n\nargument is waived.\n\n      In their second argument that tortious interference with inheritance does not\n\napply to attorneys, Appellants rely on evidence from the appellate record, but do not\n\ncite to any place in the over 9,000-page record. (The Clerk’s Record is 2917 pages\n\nand the Reporter’s Record is 6311 pages).        Appts. Br. at 21-23. Accordingly,\n\nAppellants have waived Issue 1. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i) (brief must contain a\n\nclear and concise argument with appropriate citation to authorities and to the record).\n\nThe failure to provide substantive analysis or cite authority waives the complaint.\n\nMarin Real Estate Partners, L.P. v. Vogt, 373 S.W.3d at 81. This Court has no duty\n\n\n                                          25\n\fto review a voluminous record without guidance from an appellant to determine if\n\nan issue raised constitutes reversible error. Keyes Helium Co. v. Regency Gas Servs.,\n\nL.P., 393 S.W.3d 858, 861 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.); Bullock v. American\n\nHeart Ass’n, 360 S.W.3d 661, 665 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet. denied) (appellate\n\ncourt has no duty or right to perform an independent review of the record and\n\napplicable law to determine whether there was error).\n\n       Accordingly, this Court should overrule Issue One. Alternatively, if this\n\nCourt considers Issue 1, both of Appellants’ arguments fail.\n\n       B.      Appellants concede Ted tortiously interfered with the Archers’\n               inheritance.\n\n        The jury found that Ted Anderson tortiously interfered with the Archers’\n\ninheritance from Jack Archer. CR646-53, 650. App. A. Appellants do not challenge\n\nthe jury’s liability finding. Appts. Br. at 21-23.7 Unchallenged jury findings are\n\nbinding on appeal. Wilson v. Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept., 853 S.W.2d 825, 832\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1993), rev’d on other grounds, 886 S.W.2d 259 (Tex. 1994);\n\nMarin Real Estate Partners, L.P. v. Vogt, 373 S.W.3d at 81. Thus, Issue 1 is a legal\n\nquestion answered by well-established law in Texas that requires no review of the\n\nevidence.\n\n\n\n\n7\n Appellants further cannot raise sufficiency in their Reply Brief. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.3; Sunbeam Envtl.\nServs., Inc. v. Texas Workers’ Comp. Ins. Facility, 71 S.W.3d 846, 851 (Tex. App.—Austin 2002, no pet.).\n                                                  26\n\f      C.     Texas law recognizes a cause of action for tortious interference with\n             inheritance.\n\n      Appellants fail to cite a single case to support their argument that the tortious\n\ninterference with inheritance does not exist. Appts. Br. at 21-23.\n\n      Tortious interference with inheritance was first recognized in King v. Acker,\n\n725 S.W.2d 750, 754 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, no writ). App. F.\n\nThere, King’s second wife forged a power of attorney and a will, while King was in\n\na coma and then attempted to transfer $400,000 in stock from King to herself. Id.\n\n751-52. A jury found that the second wife tortiously interfered with children’s and\n\nfirst wife’s inheritance. Id. at 752.\n\n      On appeal, the court held “that a cause of action for tortious interference with\n\ninheritance rights exists in Texas.” Id. at 754. The Houston First Court of Appeals\n\nin part relied on the Restatement of Torts which states that,\n\n      One who by fraud, duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents\n      another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that he\n      would otherwise have received is subject to liability to the other for loss\n      of the inheritance or gift.\n\nId. (citing RESTATEMENT (SECOND)        OF   TORTS §774B (1979)). The court also\n\nrecognized that in equity, “the law affords a remedy for every invasion of a legal\n\nright.” King v. Acker, 725 S.W.2d at 754 (citing Chandler v. Welborn, 156 Tex. 312,\n\n319, 294 S.W.2d 801, 807 (1956)) (“where there is a right, there is a remedy”).\n\n\n                                             27\n\f      In the twenty-eight years since King v. Acker, neither the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt, nor any court of appeals, has found that tortious interference with inheritance\n\nis not a valid cause of action.\n\n      This Court has twice recognized the tort.        In Neill v. Yett, this Court\n\nacknowledged the holding in King v. Acker, but did not comment substantively on\n\nthe tort because the cause of action was barred by limitations. 746 S.W.2d 32, 35\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1988, writ denied). In Meduna v. Holder, this Court set out the\n\njury instruction for a tortious interference claim. No. 03-06-00484-CV, 2008 WL\n\n1911184 at *2 (Tex. App.—Austin Apr. 30, 2008, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (trial court\n\nsubmitted issue on whether party had “tortiously interfered with Ruth's inheritance-\n\n‘by undue influence, fraud, or other wrongful means, intentionally prevent[ing]\n\nanother from receiving an inheritance or gift that she would otherwise have\n\nreceived.’”).\n\n      Other courts of appeals have likewise recognized tortious interference with\n\ninheritance. In re Estate of Valdez, 406 S.W.3d 228, 233 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2013, pet. denied); In re Estate of Russell, 311 S.W.3d 528, 535 (Tex. App.—El\n\nPaso 2009, no pet.); Brandes v. Rice Trust, Inc., 966 S.W.2d 144, 149-50 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, pet. denied). The United States Supreme Court\n\nhas also concluded that Texas law recognizes tortious interference with inheritance.\n\nMarshall v. Marshall, 547 U.S. 293, 313 (2006).\n\n\n                                         28\n\f      Finally, the Texas Estates Code confirms the existence of tortious interference\n\nwith inheritance. Estates Code § 54.001 provides that “the filing or contesting in\n\nprobate court of a pleading relating to a decedent’s estate does not constitute tortious\n\ninterference with inheritance of the estate.” TEX. ESTATES CODE § 54.001(a) (former\n\nProbate Code §10C). Section 54.001(a) permits a party to assert a will contest\n\nwithout the proponents of the challenged will accusing the contestants of tortious\n\ninterference with inheritance. Section 54.001(a) would be meaningless if tortious\n\ninterference with inheritance was not a viable, recognized cause of action in Texas.\n\nSee Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Inc. v. Hogue, 271 S.W.3d 238, 256 (Tex.\n\n2008) (Court must not interpret a statute in a manner that renders any part of the\n\nstatute meaningless or superfluous); Rogers v. Texas Bd. of Architectural Examiners,\n\n390 S.W.3d 377, 387 (Tex. App.—Austin, no pet.) (same).\n\n      D.     Legal malpractice privity rule does not apply in tortious\n             interference with inheritance cases.\n\n      In their second argument, Appellants contend that a tortious interference with\n\ninheritance claim cannot be brought against an attorney. Appts. Br. at 21-23.\n\nAppellants rely on a single case, Barcelo v. Elliott, that has no application here.\n\n      In Barcelo v. Elliott, the Texas Supreme Court held in a legal malpractice case\n\nthat an attorney drafting a will or a trust owes no duty of care to the beneficiaries.\n\nBarcelo v. Elliott, 923 S.W.2d 575, 579 (Tex. 1996). The rule in Barcelo applies\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\fwhen 1) an attorney who 2) drafted a will or trust 3) is being sued for legal\n\nmalpractice. None of these facts is present here.\n\n      First, when the Archers sued Ted, he was no longer an attorney. He had\n\nresigned his license to practice law four years before the Archers brought their\n\ntortious interference lawsuit. 11RRPlx148. Second, Ted did not draft the wills or\n\ntrusts at issue. 6RR164-65. It was undisputed that Leshin prepared the post-stroke\n\nwills and trusts that Jack signed. 11RRPlx167, Plx177. Third, the Archers did not\n\nsue Ted for legal malpractice; they sued Ted for tortious interference with\n\ninheritance. CR98-117, 654-719. Finally, tortious interference with inheritance is\n\nnot based on the existence of a duty. See King v. Acker, 725 S.W.2d at 752-54 (duty\n\nis not an element of tortious interference with inheritance).\n\n      Accordingly, because tortious interference with inheritance is long-\n\nrecognized in Texas jurisprudence, this Court should overrule Issue 1.\n\nII.   The Archers are entitled to their attorney’s fees and litigation expenses\n      incurred in the Bexar County litigation as damages. [Responsive to Issues\n      2-4]\n\n      Appellants raise three arguments to the district court’s award of attorney’s\n\nfees and expenses paid by the Archers in prior litigation as damages: 1) attorney’s\n\nfees cannot be recovered as damages, (Appts. Br. at 23-27); 2) the Archers had a\n\nduty to segregate attorney’s fees and failed to meet their burden, (Appts. Br. at 27-\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f29); and 3) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to show the\n\nreasonableness and necessity of the Archers’ attorney’s fees, (Appts. Br. at 29-31).\n\n      As set out below, well-established Texas law refutes Appellants’ first\n\nargument. Appellants have waived their second and third arguments.\n\n      A.     Texas jurisprudence recognizes recovery of attorney’s fees\n             incurred in prior litigation as damages.\n\n      Because of Ted’s tortious conduct in having Jack change his estate plan and\n\ndisinherit the Archers, the Archers had to hire attorneys and pursue litigation to\n\nreinstate their uncle’s original estate plan set out in Jack’s 1991 Will. The Archers\n\nput on undisputed evidence that they incurred $2,865,928 in attorney’s fees and\n\nlitigation expenses in the Bexar County guardianship litigation to get themselves\n\nreinstated as Jack intended. 6RR42, 52-53; 12RRPlx241. App. C. Texas law allows\n\nthe Archers to recover those attorney’s fees and litigation expenses incurred in prior\n\nlitigation with a third party as actual damages. Lesikar v. Rappeport, 33 S.W.3d\n\n282, 306 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2000, pet. denied).\n\n      Texas follows the “American Rule” that attorney’s fees are only recoverable\n\nif provided by contract or by statute. Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. v.\n\nNational Dev. & Research Corp., 299 S.W.3d 106, 120-23 (Tex. 2009); New\n\nAmsterdam Cas. Co. v. Texas Indus., Inc., 414 S.W.2d 914, 915 (Tex. 1967). The\n\nAmerican Rule does not apply, however, where a party is seeking attorney’s fees\n\nincurred in a prior case that were caused by a third party. Akin, Gump, 299 S.W.3d\n                                         31\n\fat 120; Noell v. City of Carrollton, 431 S.W.3d 682,715-16 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2014, pet. denied). Attorney’s fees may be recoverable, however, under equitable\n\nprinciples. Nationwide Mut. Ins. v. Holmes, 842 S.W.2d 335, 341 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1992, writ denied).\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court in Turner v. Turner addressed an equitable\n\nexception to the general rule called the “tort of another exception.” 385 S.W.2d 230,\n\n233 (Tex. 1964). App. G. Under the “tort of another exception,”\n\n       One who through the tort of another has been required to act in the\n       protection of his interests by bringing or defending an action against a\n       third person is entitled to recover reasonable compensation for loss of\n       time, attorney fees and other expenditures thereby suffered or incurred\n       in the earlier action.\n\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS §914 (1979); see also Turner, 385 S.W.2d at 234.\n\n       Under Turner, a plaintiff can recover attorney’s fees as damages if: 1) the\n\nplaintiff was involved in litigation with a third party (the “first suit”); 2) the plaintiff\n\nincurred reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees in good faith during the litigation;\n\n3) the litigation was the natural and proximate consequence of defendant’s tortious\n\nconduct; and 4) the plaintiff sought recovery of attorney’s fees from defendant in a\n\nlater suit (the “second suit”). See Turner, 385 S.W.2d at 234; see also RESTATEMENT\n\n(SECOND) OF TORTS § 914(2) (1979); Standard Fire Ins. v. Stephenson, 963 S.W.2d\n\n81, 90 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1997, no pet.); Massey v. Columbus State Bank, 35\n\nS.W.3d 697 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied).\n\n\n                                            32\n\f      Applying the rule in Turner, the Archers were involved in litigation with third\n\nparties [the “first suit” is the declaratory judgment action involving the charities in\n\nthe Bexar County guardianship] (11RRPlx23); the Archers incurred reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees in good faith during the litigation [through a contingency\n\nfee contract] (12RRPlx241); the prior litigation was a natural and proximate\n\nconsequence of Ted’s tortious conduct in interfering with Jack’s estate plan and\n\ncausing Jack to disinherit the Archers entirely in favor of the charities (3RR76-78);\n\nand the Archers sought recovery of the attorney’s fees and other monies they were\n\nforced to pay in the prior litigation from Ted in a later lawsuit [the “second suit” is\n\nthe underlying lawsuit] (CR654-719).\n\n      Numerous cases have cited the rule in Turner and awarded attorney’s fees as\n\ndamages. In Standard Fire Ins. v. Stephenson, a surviving spouse sued her deceased\n\nhusband’s workers’ compensation carrier for bad faith following the husband’s\n\nwork-related death. The wife prevailed in the bad faith case (the second suit) and\n\nwas awarded as damages her attorney’s fees paid to pursue the workers’\n\ncompensation claim (the first suit). 963 S.W.2d at 90 (citing Texas Beef Cattle Co.\n\nv. Green, 883 S.W.2d 415, 430 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1994), rev’d on other\n\ngrounds, 921 S.W.2d 203 (Tex. 1996).\n\n      In Massey v. Columbus State Bank, the plaintiff incurred over $100,000 in\n\nattorney’s fees in defending false and defamatory complaints lodged by the\n\n\n                                          33\n\fdefendant (the first suit.) Citing Turner, the court of appeals concluded that “as a\n\nresult of these wrongful acts, the Bank was forced to spend $104,000 responding to\n\nand defending against all of these complaints and grievances. The trial court\n\nproperly allowed these attorney’s fees as an element of actual damages.” (in the\n\nsecond suit). 35 S.W.3d at 702.\n\n        In Arlitt v. Patterson, following a six-year will contest, the family sued their\n\nattorneys for negligence in connection with the attorney’s estate-planning services.\n\nCiting Turner, the court of appeals recognized that “contractual or statutory\n\nauthorization is not necessary to recover attorney’s fees and costs as damages.” 995\n\nS.W.2d 713, 721 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 199, pet. denied), disapproved on other\n\ngrounds by, Belt v. Oppenheimer, Blend, Harrison & Tate, 192 S.W.3d 780 (Tex.\n\n2006). The court reversed a summary judgment denying the attorney’s fees.\n\n      Other cases recite the rule, but conclude the party requesting attorney’s fees\n\nas damages failed to meet one of the requirements. This Court, citing Lesikar and\n\nMassey, recognized that, in equity, attorney’s fees may be awarded as damages.\n\nPacesetter Pools, Inc. v. Pierce Homes, Inc., 86 S.W.3d 827, 833-34 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 2002, no pet.). The Court, however, concluded that equitable principles did\n\nnot apply where one tortfeasor sought to recover its attorney’s fees from another\n\ntortfeasor. Because attorney’s fees as damages must involve an innocent party, the\n\nattorney’s fees were denied. Id.\n\n\n                                          34\n\f      In Lesikar v. Rappeport, the defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to the\n\nplaintiff by wrongfully transferring oil and gas leases to themselves. Lesikar, 33\n\nS.W.3d at 306. The defendants’ conduct forced plaintiff to incur attorney’s fees to\n\ncontest the transfers. The court of appeals set out the standard for recovering\n\nattorney’s fees as damages because of the wrongful act of a defendant that forces a\n\nplaintiff to incur attorney’s fees. Id. Plaintiff was ultimately not awarded fees\n\nbecause she failed to put on evidence of the reasonableness and necessity of her\n\nattorney’s fees. Id. at 307.\n\n      Appellants cited cases miss the mark. Their cases do not meet the elements\n\nto recover attorney’s fees as damages:     Wein v. Sherman involved an attempt to\n\nattorney’s fees in a “first suit” and not in a “second suit.” No. 03-10-00499-CV,\n\n2013 WL 4516013 at *__ (Tex. App.—Austin August 23, 1013, no pet.); Tana Oil\n\n& Gas Corp. v. McCall, 104 S.W.3d 80, 81-83 (Tex. 2003) involved an attorney\n\nseeking to recover attorney’s fees for defending himself; Naschke v.

App.—El Paso 1979, writ ref’d\n\n\n                                         35\n\fn.r.e.) and Dalton S.S. Corp. v. W.R. Zanes & Co., 354 S.W.2d 621, 624 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 1962, no writ) both requested attorney’s fees in a “first suit” and\n\ndid not involve a “second suit.”\n\n      Accordingly, under Turner and the other cases set out above, the Archers are\n\nentitled to recover their attorney’s fees as damages from earlier litigation in Bexar\n\nCounty caused by Ted’s undisputed tortious conduct.\n\n      B.     Appellants waived their argument about segregation of attorney’s\n             fees.\n\n      Assuming segregation is an issue in an attorney’s fees as damages case, which\n\nthe Archers dispute, Appellants waived any argument about the segregation of\n\nattorney’s fees.\n\n      Appellants objected to the Archers’ attorney’s fees evidence solely on the\n\nground that the Archers could not recover attorney’s fees as damages. 6RR13-17.\n\nAppellants made no objection to the evidence on the basis of segregation. Id.\n\nFurther, Appellants made no objection to the damage question in the charge based\n\non segregation or on any other basis. 9RR94-95; App. L.\n\n      To preserve error on the failure to segregate attorney’s fees, the challenging\n\nparty must either object to the attorney’s fees evidence on the basis of the failure to\n\nsegregate or object to the charge, pointing out the failure to segregate attorney’s fees;\n\notherwise, the issue is waived. Lesikar v. Rappeport, 33 S.W.3d at 306; Rice v.\n\n\n\n                                           36\n\fGregory, 780 S.W.2d 384, 389 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1989, writ denied); see also\n\nMatthews v. Candlewood Builders, Inc., 685 S.W.2d 649, 650 (Tex. 1985).\n\n      Appellants also waived their segregation argument on appeal. Appts. Br. at\n\n28-29. Appellants’ argument purports to refer to the record, but contains no record\n\ncitations. Instead, it states “(RR )” and “(CR )” with no page references. This is\n\nwaiver. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). This Court has no duty to review a voluminous\n\nrecord without guidance from an appellant to determine if an issue raised constitutes\n\nreversible error. Keyes Helium Co. v. Regency Gas Servs., L.P., 393 S.W.3d at 861.\n\nBullock v. American Heart Ass’n, 360 S.W.3d at 665 (appellate court has no duty or\n\nright to perform an independent review of the record and applicable law to determine\n\nwhether there was error). This is particularly true given that the record in this appeal\n\nis over 9,000 pages.\n\n      C.     Segregation of attorney’s fees does not apply in an attorney’s fees\n             as damages case.\n\n      Alternatively, even considering Appellants’ waived argument, segregation of\n\nattorney’s fees has no application here. Segregation is based on some attorney’s fees\n\nbeing recoverable (by contract or by statute) and some attorney’s fees being not\n\nrecoverable. Attorney’s fees as damages, on the other hand, are based on a plaintiff\n\nbeing involved in litigation with a third party because of defendant’s tortious conduct\n\nand incurring attorney’s fees. See Turner, 385 S.W.2d at 234. Further, the Archers\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\fdid not seek their attorney’s fees in this case. They only sought as damages their\n\nattorney’s fees incurred in the prior litigation.\n\n      When recovering attorney’s fees as damages from a prior lawsuit, the only\n\nissue is whether the attorney’s fees were reasonable and necessary. Lesikar v.\n\nRappeport, 33 S.W.3d at 306; Powell v. Narried, 463 S.W.2d 43, 46 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—El Paso 1971, writ ref’d n.r.e.); see also Texas Beef Cattle Co. v. Green, 883\n\nS.W.2d at 430 (recovery of attorney’s fees as damages does not require segregation\n\nwhen there are multiple parties involved). In an attorney’s fees as damages case,\n\ncourts do not address whether the underlying lawsuit involved a claim for attorney’s\n\nfees under a contract or by statute. Rice v. Gregory, 780 S.W.2d at 389; Lesikar, 33\n\nS.W.3d at 306. None of Appellants’ cited authorities on segregation were attorney’s\n\nfees as damages cases. Appts. Br. at 27-28.\n\n      Appellants’ waived argument on segregation is refuted by the record. First,\n\nthe Archers’ witness on attorney’s fees testified that the Archers’ attorney’s fees\n\ncould not have been segregated because of the substantial overlap in the\n\nguardianship proceeding and related lawsuits. 6RR63-64. All of the legal work was\n\nintertwined. 6RR29; 12RRPlx211, Plx212. The Archers’ ability to settle with the\n\ncharities was based on the legal work performed in Jack’s contested guardianship\n\nproceeding, during which the Archers developed their proof that Jack lacked mental\n\ncapacity when he signed the post-stroke wills and trusts.\n\n\n                                           38\n\fThe core issue in all of the litigation was Jack’s mental capacity when the various\n\ndocuments were signed and Ted’s taking advantage of Jack’s lack of capacity.\n\n      Second, Appellants’ contention that some of the lawsuits the Archers pursued\n\nin the Bexar County guardianship did not involve Ted and thus supports segregation\n\nof fees, is also refuted by the record. As record reflects, Ted was the source for all\n\nof the litigation that the Archers were forced to pursue involving their uncle.\n\n      Ted’s tortious conduct in having Jack change his estate plan pitted the Archers\n\nagainst the charities in what would have been a will contest. 6RR64-65; 11RRPlx23.\n\nTed’s tortious conduct caused Jack to sign three post-stroke wills and two trusts that\n\ndisinherited the Archers in favor of the charities. 11RRPlx166, Plx171, Plx172,\n\nPlx192, Plx194. There would have been no dispute had Ted not gotten Jack to\n\nchange his 1991 Will.\n\n      Ted’s tortious conduct in having Jack sign the new wills and trusts also\n\nprecipitated the other lawsuits that the Archers filed derivatively on Jack and his\n\nestate’s behalf. The other litigation the Archer family pursed was a direct result of\n\nbeing disinherited. Ted hired and directed the attorneys (Leshin, Adami, and Hearne\n\nSr.) and Hamilton, all of whom were sued and paid settlements in the Bexar County\n\nlawsuits. 6RR71-72; 11RRPlx119, Plx122, Plx142, Plx143, Plx146, Plx151, Plx154,\n\nPlx155, Plx157, Plx165, Plx167, Plx170, Plx172, Plx179, Plx183; 12RRPlx227,\n\nPlx241. App. C.\n\n\n                                          39\n\f      Ted wired $400,000 from Jack’s bank account to Hearne Sr. to pay all of the\n\nattorney’s fees. 6RR74. These fees were eventually reimbursed to Jack’s estate as a\n\nresult of the Archers’ lawsuit. 6RR60-62. Ted instructed Leshin to put J.R. Hamilton\n\nin as trustee of Jack’s Trust. 6RR71-72. Hamilton also settled and paid money back\n\nto Jack. That is, without Ted wanting to change Jack’s estate plan, Leshin, Hearne,\n\nSr., Adami, or J.R. Hamilton would not have been involved.\n\n      As Appellee Carol Archer Bugg testified, but for Ted’s conduct, her family\n\nwould not have been in years of litigation and been forced to pay millions in\n\nattorney’s fees and settlement money simply to obtain what their Uncle Jack had\n\nalways intended. 3RR176-178.\n\n      Appellants offered no evidence on the issue of segregation.\n\n      Every lawsuit the Archers were forced to pursue in the Bexar County\n\nguardianship was directly tied to Ted, and without Ted’s tortious conduct, the\n\nArchers would not have been forced to pursue. Accordingly, there is no basis to\n\nsegregate attorney’s fees on the basis that Ted was not involved.\n\n      D.     Appellants waive their sufficiency of the evidence argument.\n\n      Appellants argue that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to\n\nshow the reasonableness and necessity of the Archers’ attorney’s fees. Appts. Br. at\n\n29-31. Appellants’ argument consists of two conclusory statements without citation\n\nto the record. A sufficiency of the evidence point must cite to the record or the issue\n\n\n                                          40\n\fis waived. Rendleman v. Clarke, 909 S.W.2d 56, 58-59 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 1995, writ dism’d as moot) (sufficiency point waived by failure to refer to\n\nreporter’s record). This Court has no duty to perform an independent review of the\n\nrecord and applicable law to determine whether there was error. Green v. Kaposta,\n\n152 S.W.3d 839, 841 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.); Brandon v. Am. Sterilizer\n\nCo., 880 S.W.2d 488, 493-94 (Tex. App.—Austin 1994, no writ). Accordingly,\n\nAppellants waive their sufficiency argument. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n       E.    The evidence is factually and legally sufficient as to the\n             reasonableness and necessity of the Archers’ attorney’s fees.\n\n      In the event the Court considers Appellants’ waived argument, the evidence\n\nis legally and factually sufficient to show reasonableness and necessity of the\n\nArchers’ attorney’s fees.\n\n      Appellants do not attack the sufficiency of the evidence on the amount of the\n\nattorney’s fees paid by the Archers or the amount of damages the jury found. Appts.\n\nBr. at 29-31. Instead, Appellants attack only the evidentiary foundation of the\n\nreasonableness and necessity of the Archers’ attorney’s fees.\n\n      This Court reviews a factual sufficiency point by considering all of the\n\nevidence to determine if there is some evidence supporting the finding, and then\n\ndetermines whether the finding is so weak or against the overwhelming weight of\n\nthe evidence as to be manifestly unjust. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex.\n\n1986). This Court can sustain a legal sufficiency challenge only if: “(a) there is a\n                                        41\n\fcomplete absence of evidence of a vital fact, (b) the court is barred by rules of law\n\nor of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact,\n\n(c) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla, or (d)\n\nthe evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact.” Volkswagen of\n\nAm., Inc. v. Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d 897, 903 (Tex. 2004).\n\n       The evidence here is both legally and factually sufficient to support the\n\nArchers’ attorney’s fees as being reasonable and necessary. After the Archers\n\npresented extensive testimony on the amount of attorney’s fees paid for the Bexar\n\nCounty litigation, (see infra II.F. at 51) Frank Ikard, one of the attorneys who\n\nrepresented the Archers throughout the Bexar County litigation, provided expert\n\ntestimony as to the reasonableness and necessity for the attorney’s fees. 7RR94-\n\n139.\n\n       Ikard testified that he had practiced law for more than 40 years and in the\n\nfiduciary litigation area for more than 20 years. 7RR108.          Ikard explained the\n\nnature of the problems and issues in the case from the outset, as well as the strategies\n\nand work pursued on the Archers’ behalf. 7RR96-97, 110-25.\n\n       Ikard went through the Texas Disciplinary Rules 1.04(b) to support the\n\nreasonableness and necessity of the attorney’s fees. 7RR110-25. Ikard explained\n\nthat the fee arrangement was originally hourly but then changed to a contingent fee.\n\n7RR106-07. Ikard’s firm represented the Archers for close to a decade. 7RR110.\n\n\n                                          42\n\f      Ikard testified about the number of hours spent on the case and the expenses\n\nincurred. 7RR110. Ikard explained the novelty and complexity of the issues,\n\nbeginning with the difficulty in trying to serve Jack in the original guardianship\n\nproceeding because he was being moved from location to location to avoid service.\n\n7RR110-11; 11RRPlx17. A further complicating and novel factor was that Jack had\n\nfive attorneys agreeing in court that he needed a guardian. 7RR112-13. While the\n\nattorneys tried to memorialize the agreement, Ted fired the attorneys and hired\n\nanother one to repudiate the agreement calling for a guardian. Id. This imposed\n\nadditional expense and difficulty and forced the Archers to refile the guardianship.\n\n7RR112, 114-15. According to Ikard, it was novel and unusual to have someone in\n\nJack’s position in an agreed guardianship and, when the guardianship agreement was\n\nrepudiated, to have Jack put all of his assets in trust with Jack as trustee. 7RR112-\n\n13.\n\n      Another complicating factor in the case was the court-appointed temporary\n\nguardian of the estate, J.R. Hamilton, who eventually was removed because he failed\n\nto file statutory reports on the ward’s estate. 7RR117-18. After Hamilton, there were\n\na series of temporary guardians. 7RR120. Another unusual matter was that the\n\ncourt-appointed temporary guardian of Jack’s person refused to allow the Archers\n\nto visit him. 7RR120-21. This forced the Archers to seek court-ordered visitation.\n\n7RR121. Another complicating factor was that Hearne Sr. obtained $400,000 from\n\n\n                                         43\n\fJack’s bank account through Ted and used the money to pay the attorneys\n\nrepresenting Jack, without court approval. 7RR121-22. Hearne Sr. was eventually\n\nordered to repay this money. Id.\n\n       Further, Ikard testified to the successes obtained by his firm’s representation\n\nof the Archers. 7RR110-25. Ikard testified to the amount involved and the results\n\nobtained. 7RR95. In particular, the Archers were reunited with their uncle, the post-\n\nstroke wills were set aside, Bugg became Jack’s guardian, and an independent third\n\nparty became the guardian of Jack’s estate. 7RR102-03. The Archers were also\n\nsuccessful in recovering monies that had been wrongfully taken from Jack. 7RR105,\n\n122-24.\n\n       Finally, Ikard testified that the attorney’s fees incurred and paid by the\n\nArchers were both reasonable and necessary. 7RR110-26; 125-26. Ikard also\n\ntestified that the forty-percent contingency fee was usual and customary in Travis\n\nCounty for the kind of legal worked performed on the Archers’ behalf. 7RR125-26.\n\n       Appellants made no attempt to attack Ikard’s credentials, credibility, or his\n\nopinions on the reasonableness of and necessity for the attorney’s fees the Archers\n\npaid. 7RR126-39.\n\n       Further, Ikard’s expert opinion was uncontroverted. Appellants offered no\n\nwitness or other evidence on the issue of the attorney’s fees that the Archers paid in\n\nthe prior litigation.\n\n\n                                          44\n\f      Accordingly, the evidence was both legally and factually sufficient to support\n\nthe reasonableness and necessity for the Archers’ attorney’s fees and litigation\n\nexpenses paid in the prior litigation. Thus, this Court can affirm the damage award\n\nin the Final Judgment. As set out below, the Archers seek additional damages. This\n\nCourt should overrule Issues 2, 3 and 4.\n\n      F.     The district court erred in denying the Archers’ motion for partial\n             JNOV on the full amount of attorney’s fees proved as a matter of\n             law. [Cross Issue 1]\n\n      By cross-issue, the Archers seek the full amount of their attorney’s fees paid\n\nin the prior litigation as damages that were proved as a matter of law, but which were\n\nnot awarded by the district court. The Archers seek the entire amount of attorney’s\n\nfees paid in the prior litigation of $2,865,928, along with the $588,054 awarded by\n\nthe district court in post-verdict motions. CR1461. App. K.\n\n      The Archers’ damage model:\n\n      The following damage discussion relates to the arguments under II.F. and\n\nIII.C. See infra III.C at 60. The Archers put on uncontroverted evidence of their total\n\ndamages of $3,453,982. This amount consisted of the settlement with the charities\n\nof $588,054 and the $2,865,928 in attorney’s fees paid. The jury’s damage award\n\nreduced the Archers’ attorney’s fees damages by thirty percent and (as addressed in\n\nIII. C. below) entirely omitted the $588,054 paid to settle with the charities. By\n\nmaking these two deductions, the resulting damages in the verdict are $2,006,150:\n\n\n                                           45\n\f    Plaintiff’s Uncontroverted Evidence of                           Jury’s Damage Award\n                    Damages\n     Attorney’s fees &                                      Attorney’s fees &         $2,865,928 – 30%\n    litigation expenses      $2,865,928                    litigation expenses          = $2,006,150\n      Settlement with                                        Settlement with\n          charities         + $588,054                           charities                       $0\n\n                     $3,453,982                                              $2,006,150\n\nCR1470-71; 6RR42, 56-58, 11RRPlx24; 12RRPlx241. App. B, C.\n\n        Because their damages evidence was uncontroverted, the Archers filed a\n\nmotion for partial JNOV and sought the entire amount of their attorney’s fees and\n\nthe settlement with the charities. After a hearing, on July 17, 2013, the district court\n\ndenied the Archers’ motion for partial JNOV. 8 CR1209; App. H.\n\n        This Court reviews a district court’s ruling on a motion for JNOV under a\n\nlegal sufficiency standard. Helping Hands Home Care, Inc. v. Home Health of\n\nTarrant County, Inc., 393 S.W.3d 492, 515 (Tex. App—Dallas 2013, pet. denied);\n\nCity of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 823 (Tex. 2005). To sustain a legal\n\nsufficiency challenge, this Court must find: “(a) there is a complete absence of\n\nevidence of a vital fact, (b) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from\n\ngiving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact, (c) the evidence\n\noffered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla, or (d) the evidence\n\n\n\n8\n The Archers also requested a partial directed verdict on damages and objected to the charge on this basis.\n9RR73-76, 93-94.\n\n\n                                                    46\n\fconclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact.” Volkswagen of America, Inc.\n\nv. Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d at 903.\n\n      In reviewing a matter of law challenge, this Court first examines the record\n\nfor evidence that supports the finding, while ignoring contrary evidence. Dow\n\nChem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 241 (Tex. 2001). If there is no evidence to\n\nsupport the finding, this Court then examines the entire record to determine if the\n\ncontrary proposition is established as a matter of law. Id.\n\n      In a legal sufficiency review, the jury is not free to disregard undisputed\n\nevidence. With undisputed evidence, the jury may draw whatever inferences they\n\nwish as long as more than one inference is possible. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at\n\n821. If the evidence allows only one inference, neither the jury nor the reviewing\n\ncourt may disregard it. Id. at 822. The jury decides issues raised by conflicting\n\nevidence, “but where there is evidence upon an issue and there is no evidence to the\n\ncontrary, then the jury has not the right to disregard the undisputed evidence and\n\ndecide such issue in accordance with their wishes.” Texas Dept. of Transp. v.\n\nGuerra, 858 S.W.2d 44, 47 (Tex.

No evidence supports the jury’s thirty-percent reduction of\n                   the attorney’s fees the Archers paid in prior litigation.\n\n      The jury reduced the Archers attorney’s fees paid in the Bexar County\n\nlitigation of $2,865,928 by 30%. CR646-653, 651. App. A. This Court’s first\n                                         47\n\finquiry is to consider the evidence that supports the jury’s verdict that reduced the\n\nArchers’ attorney’s fees paid in prior litigation.\n\n          The jury was asked the following question for damages with the following\n\ninstruction:\n\n          What sum of money, if paid now in cash, would fairly and reasonably\n          compensate Plaintiffs for their damages, if any, proximately caused by\n          the tortious interference?\n\n          Consider the following element of damages and none other: the\n          difference in value, if any, of the inheritance actually received by\n          Plaintiffs and the value of the inheritance that Plaintiffs would have\n          received from Jack Archer had there been no interference by the\n          Defendant.\n\nCR646-653, 651.9\n\n          The Archers presented uncontroverted evidence that the amount of attorney’s\n\nfees and litigation expenses that they paid as a result of the Bexar County litigation\n\nwas $2,865,928. 6RR42, 52-53, 57; 12RRPlx241. App. C. The Archers further\n\npresented expert testimony as to the reasonableness and necessity of those attorney’s\n\nfees. See supra II.E. at 41.\n\n          In response to the Archers’ evidence, Appellants had the burden to put on\n\ncontradictory expert evidence. Appellants failed to do so. Instead, Appellants’\n\nevidence and entire case went to one issue—Jack’s mental status when he signed\n\n\n\n\n9\n    This question also contained a definition of “proximate cause.” CR646-653, 651.

None of Appellants’ witnesses\n\nor documentary evidence addressed the Archers’ attorney’s fees.\n\n      Appellants offered no expert witness on attorney’s fees. Expert testimony is\n\nrequired to support an award of attorney’s fees. Woollett v. Matyastik, 23 S.W.3d\n\n48, 52 (Tex. App.—Austin 2000, pet. denied); Cantu v. Moore, 90 S.W.3d 821, 826\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, pet. denied). Appellants had to present expert\n\ntestimony that the Archers’ attorney’s fees in the prior litigation were not reasonable\n\nand necessary. Without expert testimony that the Archers’ fees were not reasonable\n\nand necessary, Appellants have no basis to attack the amount of the attorney’s fees.\n\n      Appellants offered no evidence to create a range of damages. See Gulf States\n\nUtils. v. Low, 79 S.W.3d 561, 566 (Tex. 2002) (jury can award damages within the\n\nrange of evidence presented at trial). Appellants offered no evidence to support a\n\nthirty-percent reduction in the Archers’ attorney’s fees paid or to set up a range of\n\ndamages. Appellants did not adduce any evidence on cross-examination of the\n\nArchers’ witnesses to support the jury’s reduction of attorney’s fees paid in the prior\n\nlitigation. 3RR178-218; 4RR5-32, 51-63; 6RR59-68. Appellants also offered no\n\nevidence to support the jury’s reduction of the Archers’ total damages by\n\napproximately 58% ($3,453,982 total damages x 58% = $2,003,309.56).\n\n      Further, the jury is not free to arrive at a damages number on their own that is\n\nnot supported by the evidence or to “pull figures out of a hat.” First State Bank v.\n\n\n                                          49\n\fKeilman, 851 S.W.2d 914, 930-31 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993, writ denied); Mills v.\n\nJackson, 711 S.W.2d 427, 434 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1986, no writ).\n\n      In particular, with uncontradicted evidence of attorney’s fees, the jury is not\n\nfree to pick a number. Smith v. Patrick W.Y. Tam Trust, 235 S.W.3d 819, 828-29\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2007), rev’d on other grounds, 296 S.W.3d 545 (Tex. 2009). In\n\nSmith, the Trust sued the Smiths as guarantors on a lease when the lessee defaulted,\n\nand sought actual damages of $200,000 and $47,438.75 in attorney’s fees. 235\n\nS.W.3d at 828-29. The jury awarded $65,000 in damages and no attorney’s fees.\n\nId. at 822. The trial court rendered judgment on the damages amount and awarded\n\n$7,500 in attorney’s fees.\n\n      The Dallas Court of Appeals vacated the $7,500 attorney’s fees award and\n\nrendered judgment for the Trust’s $47,438.75 in attorney’s fees. Id. at 829. The\n\nDallas Court of Appeals rejected the Smiths’ argument that the jury was entitled to\n\ndisregard the uncontroverted evidence and award no attorney’s fees. In response to\n\nthe Trust’s uncontroverted evidence of its attorney’s fees, the Smiths failed to\n\npresent evidence that the attorney’s fees were not necessary or that the Trust’s\n\nattorney’s legal work had no value. Id. Accordingly, the court of appeals concluded\n\nthere was “no evidence to support the jury’s finding of no attorney’s fees.” Id. The\n\ncourt of appeals rendered judgment for $47,438.75 in attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f       The court of appeals noted that the Smiths had ample opportunity to question\n\nor challenge the Trust’s attorney’s fees evidence. Id. at 828. The Smiths, however,\n\ndid not challenge the amount of the fees charged, the nature of the services provided,\n\nor whether the amount reflected the nature and complexity of the case. Id.\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court reversed, but only on the remedy awarded by the\n\ncourt of appeals. Smith, 296 S.W.3d at 548. The supreme court recognized the same\n\nproblem as the court of appeals: “no evidence supported the jury’s refusal to award\n\nany attorney’s fees (as the court of appeals correctly noted).” Id. The supreme court,\n\nhowever, concluded that the remedy had to be a remand to consider the amount of\n\nattorney’s fees in light of the reduction in actual damages. Id.\n\n       Applying the reasoning in Smith, the jury was not free to disregard the\n\nArchers’ uncontradicted evidence that they paid $2,865,928 in attorney’s fees and\n\nlitigation expenses in the prior litigation and arbitrarily pick another number with no\n\nevidentiary basis. Thus, no evidence supports the jury’s 30% reduction of attorney’s\n\nfees that the Archers paid in the earlier litigation in Bexar County by apportioning\n\nliability.\n\n             2.     The Archers proved the entire amount of their attorney’s\n                    fees paid in the Bexar County litigation as a matter of law.\n\n       After reviewing the evidence in support of the jury’s verdict, this Court must\n\nthen consider all of the evidence to determine whether the Archers established their\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\fdamages as a matter of law. Dow Chem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at 241; Allman, 314 S.W.3d\n\nat 673.\n\n      The Archers’ attorney’s fees paid in the prior litigation was uncontroverted.\n\nA jury may not disregard uncontroverted evidence. Alice Leasing Corp. v. Castillo,\n\n53 S.W.3d 433, 445 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, pet. denied).\n\n      Three witnesses testified about the amount of attorney’s fees paid by the\n\nArchers. First, Bugg testified about the contentiousness of the litigation from its\n\ninception until its conclusion. 3RR140-147, 151-155, 157-164. According to Bugg,\n\nwhen the Archers could no longer pursue the litigation on an hourly basis, they\n\nconverted to a contingency fee. 3RR155-156.\n\n      Mary Haught, one of the Archers’ former attorneys, provided a detailed\n\nexplanation of the attorney’s fees and litigation expenses that the Archers paid to be\n\nreinstated as beneficiaries under Jack’s will. 6RR26-53. Haught explained that the\n\nArchers converted from an hourly fee arrangement to a contingency fee after\n\nlearning of the disinheritance. 6RR22-26. The contingency fee was based on getting\n\nthe Archers reinstated as beneficiaries and then the law firm received a percentage\n\nof the value of Jack’s estate, including monies brought into Jack’s guardianship\n\nestate through lawsuits against Ted and the attorneys he had hired. 3RR155-56;\n\n6RR23-26; 11RRPlx22 at 2-3. The law firm further agreed to sue the various people\n\nwho had taken money from Jack and receive a percentage of any of that recovery.\n\n\n                                         52\n\f6RR23-26. When the contingency fee contract was entered, the Archers knew they\n\nhad been disinherited. 6RR24.\n\n        Haught then explained the contingency fee calculation. 12RRPlx241. App.\n\nC. 10 The calculation began with calculating the total value of Jack’s estate. Using\n\nthe estate tax return that valued Jack’s estate at $3,848,678 and an agreed upon value\n\nfor Jack’s ranch of $3,730,866, the total estate value of Jack’s estate was $7,579.544.\n\n6RR26-29; 12RRPlx202, Plx241. Monies received as a result of the Bexar County\n\nguardianship lawsuits were added to the total estate value. 6RR29-32; 12RRPlx203\n\n(Adami settlement), Plx204(Hearne Sr. settlement), Plx205, Plx206, Plx207\n\n(Hamilton settlement), Plx241.\n\n        Because the calculation is based on money that was actually received by the\n\nArcher Family, monies that the Archers had to pay to probate Jack’s will and the\n\nmonies paid to settle with the charities were subtracted. 6RR32-35; 12RRPlx241.\n\nThis left $7,256,058 as “litigation proceeds.”\n\n        The firm’s expenses of $538,096 and the fees paid the Archers of $118,454\n\nwere subtracted. 6RR36-39, 39-40; 12RRPlx209, Plx241. This calculation left\n\n$6,599,508 as the amount to which the contingency fee percentage was applied.\n\n6RR40; 12RRPlx241. The firm’s forty-percent contingency fee was $2,639,803.20\n\n\n\n10\n   Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 241 is not in numerical order in the Reporter’s Record. App. C. It is found before\nPlx222.\n                                                   53\n\fplus expenses of $538,096, which came to a total fee due the law firm of $3,177,899.\n\n6RR40-41; 12RRPlx241. App. C. The Archers and the law firm negotiated the total\n\nfee down to $2,865,928. 6RR42,52-53; 12RRPlx241. At the end of the day, the\n\nArchers paid $2,865,928 in attorney’s fees to Ikard & Golden. 6RR53; 12RRPlx\n\n241. Haught went on to explain how the firm was paid as set out on Plx241 page 2.\n\n6RR29-32, 40-53.\n\n      Finally, as set out above, and incorporated here by reference to avoid\n\nrepetition, Frank Ikard testified as the reasonable and necessity of the $2,865,928 in\n\nattorney’s fees paid by the Archers. See supra II.E. at 41.\n\n      Through the testimony of Bugg, Haught, and Ikard, and the exhibits during\n\ntheir respective testimony, the Archers proved as a matter of law the amount of the\n\nattorney’s fees the Archers paid in the prior litigation: $2,865,928. The evidence\n\nsupports only one inference.\n\n      Appellants had every opportunity to challenge the Archers’ evidence on the\n\nattorney’s fees portion of damages. The Archers’ evidence of damages was not\n\ncalled into question on cross-examination and was never controverted. “Clear,\n\ndirect, and uncontroverted evidence of attorney’s fees is taken as true as a matter of\n\nlaw, especially when the opposing party has the means and opportunity to disprove\n\nthe testimony.” B&W Supply, Inc. v. Beckman, 305 S.W.3d 10, 20-21 (Tex. App.—\n\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\fHouston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). Appellants do not challenge the amount of\n\nattorney’s fees paid on appeal.\n\n       A reasonable juror could have disregarded the undisputed evidence of\n\n$2,865,928 as the amount the Archers paid in attorney’s fees. Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying the Archers’ motion for partial JNOV.\n\n       Thus, in addition to seeking an affirmance of the Final Judgment of liability,\n\nthe Archers request that the Court sustain their Cross Issue 1 and render judgment\n\nthat the district court should have rendered on their total attorney’s fees paid in the\n\nprior litigation and proved as a matter of law of $2,865,928, in addition to the\n\n$588,054 that the district court awarded post-verdict.\n\n       In the alternative, based on the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\n\nof attorney’s fees discussed above, the Archers request that this Court affirm the\n\nFinal Judgment on liability and damages.\n\nIII.   The district court properly granted Appellants’ motion for partial JNOV\n       and awarded the Archers the amount paid to settle with the charities.\n       [Responsive to Issue 5]\n\n       Appellants complain of the district court’s award of an additional $588,054 in\n\ndamages to settle with the charities. As set out above in the damage model chart,\n\nthe jury’s award omitted the $588,054 that the Archers paid to settle with the\n\ncharities. Supra II.F. at 45-46. Appellants have waived this issue. Even considering\n\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\fthe waived issue, the district court correctly modified the jury’s damage award and\n\nawarded the Archers’ additional damages.\n\n      A.     Appellants’ briefing error waives appellate review.\n\n      In Issue 5, Appellants cite no authority, make no cites to record, and offer no\n\ncogent arguments. Appts. Br. at 31-32. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i) (brief must\n\ncontain a clear and concise argument with appropriate citation to authorities and to\n\nthe record). The failure to provide substantive analysis or cite authority waives the\n\ncomplaint. Marin Real Estate Partners, L.P. v. Vogt, 373 S.W.3d 75. Further, this\n\nCourt has no duty to review a voluminous record without guidance from an appellant\n\nto determine if an issue raised constitutes reversible error. Keyes Helium Co. v.\n\nRegency Gas Servs., L.P., 393 S.W.3d at 861. Accordingly, Issue 5 is waived.\n\n      B.     Appellants’ post-verdict motions waive appellate review.\n\n      Appellants’ post-verdict motions, which unqualifiedly urged the district court\n\nto award the Archers the additional damages of $588,054, waive this Court’s review.\n\n      In their motion for partial JNOV, Appellants agreed without reservation that\n\nthe Archers proved their settlement with the charities cost them $588,054 and that\n\nthe district court should revise the Jury’s Verdict:\n\n      For the reasons given above, Defendants respectfully urge the Court to\n      grant their Motion for Partial Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict,\n      and modify the jury’s finding on damages to reflect the only element\n      properly proved, that is, $588,054.00, the amount paid by Plaintiffs in\n      settlement with the charities in the prior litigation . . . . .\n\n\n                                          56\n\fCR1210-18, 1217 (emphasis added); App. I\n\n      After the district court heard and denied the Archers’ motion for partial JNOV\n\non July 17, 2013 (CR1209), and after the Archers pointed out that Appellants had\n\nconceded the Archers were entitled to the $588,054 in additional damages on July\n\n18, (CR1235-51), Appellants filed an amended motion for partial JNOV on July 25,\n\nbut still affirmatively acknowledged that the Archers proved the settlement with the\n\ncharities number:\n\n      In the alternative [if the district court concluded tortious interference\n      with inheritance is a valid cause of action], Defendants urge the Court\n      to grant their Motion for Partial Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict,\n      and reduce the jury’s finding on damages to $588,054.00, the amount\n      paid by Plaintiffs in settlement with the charities in the prior litigation\n      ....\n\nCR1264, 1273 (emphasis added); App. J\n\n      When district court signed the Final Judgment, only Appellants’ amended\n\nmotion for JNOV remained pending (along with both parties’ briefs in support of a\n\nprejudgment interest calculation). CR1276, 1278-1469, 1252, 1260. Accordingly,\n\nthe district court implicitly granted Appellants’ amended motion for JNOV when the\n\ncourt signed the Final Judgment and added $588,054 to the jury’s $2,006,150.\n\nCR1470-71; see TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)(A); Allstate Prop. & Cas. Ins. v. Gutierrez,\n\n281 S.W.3d 535, 539 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2008, no pet.) (final judgment implicitly\n\ndenied motion for leave to amend pleadings); Mason v. Mason, No. 07-12-00007,\n\n\n\n                                          57\n\f2014 WL 199649 at *6 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Jan. 13, 2014, no pet. (mem. op.)\n\n(final judgment implicitly granted post-verdict request for pre-judgment interest).\n\n      Applying settlement credits and prejudgment interest, the Final Judgment\n\nawarded the Archers $2,564,899.90 plus post-judgment interest.        CR1235, 1461,\n\n1470-71. App. B, K.\n\n      For several reasons, Appellants’ post-verdict motions waive this Court’s\n\nreview of the district court’s award of the $588,054 in damages.\n\n      First, Appellants failed to preserve their complaint in the trial court. In both\n\nmotions for partial JNOV, Appellants requested, without qualification, the district\n\ncourt to award $588,054 to the Archers. CR1217, 1273. App. I, J. Appellants never\n\npreserved the argument they now raise on appeal. CR 1210-18, 1264-75; see First\n\nNat’l Bank v. Fojtik, 775 S.W.2d 632, 633 (Tex. 1989); Smith v. East, 411 S.W.3d\n\n519, 528-29 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, pet. denied) (to preserve right to complain\n\nabout judgment, motion must state its disagreement with the content and result of\n\nthe judgment); Bray v. Tejas Toyota, Inc., 363 S.W.3d 777, 787 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2012, no pet.) (same). Appellants never stated in their motions for JNOV, as\n\nrequired by this Court in Smith and Bray, that they specifically reserved the right to\n\ncomplain on appeal about the $588,054 in damages. Accordingly, the failure to\n\ncomply with the rule in Fojtik/Smith/Bray results in waiver of Issue 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                         58\n\f      Second, Appellants invited the alleged error of which they now complain. A\n\nparty may not invite error by asking “something of a court and then complain that\n\nthe court committed error in giving it to him.” Northeast Tex. Motor Lines, Inc. v.\n\nHodges, 138 Tex. 280, 158 S.W.2d 487, 488 (1942); Bluestar Energy, Inc. v.\n\nMurphy, 205 S.W.3d 96, 101 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2006, pet. denied). Appellants\n\nunqualifiedly requested the district court to award the Archers $588,054, and the\n\ndistrict court did precisely what Appellants requested. Thus, the invited error\n\ndoctrine bars this Court’s review of Issue 5.\n\n       Finally, Appellants judicially admitted the $588,054 in damages. A judicial\n\nadmission is a clear, deliberate, and unequivocal statement that “occurs when an\n\nassertion of fact is conclusively established in live pleadings, making the\n\nintroduction of other pleadings or evidence unnecessary.” Horizon/CMS Healthcare\n\nCorp. v. Auld, 34 S.W.3d 887, 905 (Tex. 2000). A judicial admission bars the party\n\nfrom disputing the admitted fact. Id.\n\n      The judicial admission doctrine applies not only to pleadings, but also to post-\n\ntrial filings and even statements made in an appellate brief. Jansen v. Fitzpatrick,\n\n14 S.W.3d 426, 431 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet); City of San\n\nAntonio v. Hardee, 70 S.W.3d 207, 212 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, no pet.).\n\n\n\n\n                                         59\n\f      Appellants’ statement in their motions for partial JNOV of the “amount paid,”\n\nand “properly proved” damages of $588,054 are judicial admissions. CR1217, 1273.\n\nApp. I, J. Accordingly, Appellants waive appellate review of Issue 5.\n\n      C.     The Archers proved the settlement with the charities amount as a\n             matter of law. [Cross Issue 2]\n\n      Alternatively, even considering Appellants’ waived Issue 5, the district court\n\nproperly granted Appellants’ JNOV and awarded the Archers the settlement with the\n\ncharities amount. In the event this Court sustains Issue 5 and reverses the district\n\ncourt’s award of $588,054, and to avoid rendition of judgment on the verdict, the\n\nArchers bring a cross issue on the amount of damages paid to settle with the charities.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 38.2(b); TEX. R. CIV. P. 324(c).\n\n      This Court reviews a JNOV under a legal sufficiency standard. When a party\n\nchallenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting an adverse finding on an\n\nissue on which the party had the burden of proof, it must show that the evidence\n\nestablishes as a matter of law all vital facts in support of the issue. Dow Chem. Co.\n\nv. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 241 (Tex. 2001); Allman v. Butcher, 314 S.W.3d 671,\n\n673 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no pet.). If there is no evidence to support the finding,\n\nthe court of appeals then reviews the entire record to determine if the contrary\n\nproposition is established as a matter of law. Dow Chem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at 241;\n\nAllman, 314 S.W.3d at 673.\n\n\n\n                                          60\n\f      In a legal sufficiency review, the jury is not free to disregard undisputed\n\nevidence. With undisputed evidence, the jury may draw whatever inferences they\n\nwish as long as more than one inference is possible. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at\n\n821. If the evidence allows only one inference, however, neither the jury nor the\n\nreviewing court may disregard it. Id. at 822. The jury decides issues raised by\n\nconflicting evidence, “but where there is evidence upon an issue and there is no\n\nevidence to the contrary, then the jury has not the right to disregard the undisputed\n\nevidence and decide such issue in accordance with their wishes.” Texas Dept. of\n\nTransp. v. Guerra, 858 S.W.2d at 47 (quoting Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Burden, 146\n\nTex. 109, 203 S.W.2d 522, 530 (1947)). A jury may not disregard uncontroverted\n\nevidence. Alice Leasing Corp. v. Castillo, 53 S.W.3d at 445.\n\n      This Court may affirm the JNOV only if there is no evidence to support the\n\njury’s finding or as here, the evidence establishes a contrary answer as a matter of\n\nlaw. Arlington Home, Inc. v. Peak Envtl. Consultants, Inc., 361 S.W.3d 773, 779\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, pet. denied). Thus, this Court can affirm\n\nthe district court’s award of $588,054 if the evidence establishes that number as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                         61\n\f              1.     No evidence supports awarding zero damages for the\n                     settlement with the charities.\n\n        This Court’s first inquiry is to consider the evidence that supports the jury’s\n\nverdict that reduced the Archers’ damages by the amount of the settlement with the\n\ncharities. See Tiller v. McLure, 121 S.W.3d 709, 713 (Tex. 2003).\n\n        The Archers’ settlement with the charities reinstated them as beneficiaries of\n\nJack’s estate. Had there been no settlement with the charities, the charities would\n\nhave offered for probate the wills Jack signed in 2000 and 2001 that disinherited the\n\nArchers. 6RR64-65; 11RRPlx23 at 8. With multiple wills offered for probate, the\n\nArchers would have been forced into more costly litigation. 6RR64-65. By settling\n\nwith the charities, however, the Archers insured that Jack’s 1991 Will would be\n\nprobated and that the post-stroke wills would not be offered for probate. 11RRPlx23\n\nat 8.\n\n        The Archers paid the twelve charities $588,054, over and above what Jack’s\n\npre-stroke will gave them. 6RR34-35; 12RRPlx241. App. C. The pre-stroke will\n\ngave the charities sixty percent of Jack’s oil and gas interests, valued at $93,522.\n\n12RRPlx241. The Archers gave the charities Jack’s coin collection valued at\n\n$510,028 and paid the charities’ attorney’s fees as part of the settlement. 3RR159-\n\n61; 11RRPlx24.\n\n        Appellants offered no evidence to assail the amount the Archers paid to settle\n\nwith the charities and offered no evidence or argument to exclude the settlement with\n                                           62\n\fthe charities from the Archers’ total damages. Appellants failed to refute Appellee\n\nBugg’s or Haught’s explanation of the need to settle to avoid a will contest with the\n\ncharities. 3RR178-218; 4RR5-32, 51-63; 6RR59-68. The evidence was\n\nuncontroverted. The jury cannot pick a number that was not supported by the\n\nevidence. First State Bank v. Keilman, 851 S.W.2d at 930.\n\n      Accordingly, no evidence supports excluding the amount of the settlement\n\nwith the charities and awarding zero damages for that portion of the Archers’\n\ndamages. The only evidence was that the Archers paid $588,054 to settle with the\n\ncharities and avoid a will contest. Again, no evidence supported the jury’s reduction\n\nof the Archers’ total damages by approximately 58%.\n\n             2.    The Archers proved as a matter of law that they paid\n                   $588,054 to settle with the charities.\n\n      After reviewing the evidence in support of the jury’s omission of the\n\nsettlement with the charities number, this Court must then consider all of the\n\nevidence to determine whether the Archers proved their settlement with the charities\n\nas a matter of law. Dow Chem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at 241; Allman, 314 S.W.3d at 673.\n\n      Bugg testified extensively about the settlement with the charities. 3RR157-\n\n163. The Family Settlement Agreement and the copies of checks paying attorney’s\n\nfees to the charities further substantiated the amounts the Archers paid to the twelve\n\ncharities. 11RRPlx23, Plx24.\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\f      As Jack’s 1991 Will provided, twelve named charities were to split sixty-\n\npercent of Jack’s mineral interests. 11RRPlx9 at 3-4. Bugg testified that, with the\n\nadditional wills Jack signed at Ted Anderson’s insistence, the Archer family was\n\ndisinherited entirely in favor of the charities, meaning that the charities would have\n\nreceived Jack’s entire estate. 3RR156-157; 4RR33-34; 6RR64-66; 12RRPlx241.\n\nBugg further testified that, because the Plaintiffs knew Jack’s long-time estate plan\n\nhad been to leave the bulk of his estate to his family and that he lacked any mental\n\ncapacity to change that estate plan after his stroke, the family would have pursued a\n\nwill contest after Jack’s death. 3RR103. The family, however, chose to avoid\n\nwaiting until Jack’s death and instituted a declaratory judgment action to address the\n\nmultiple wills and multiple trusts before Jack died. 6RR63, 70-71.\n\n      Haught also testified about the Archers’ settlement with the twelve charities.\n\n6RR53-58; 12RRPlx241. Jack’s 1991 Will gave the charities $93,522. 6RR55;\n\n12Plx241. App. C. In settlement with the Archers, the charities also received Jack’s\n\ncoin collection, valued at $510,028. 6RR55; 12RRPlx241. The Archers also paid\n\nthe charities’ attorney’s fees in the declaratory judgment. 6RR55-58; 11RRPlx24.\n\nAccording to Haught, because Jack signed the post-stroke wills, the Archers were\n\nforced to settle with the charities and pay them the $588,054. 6RR58; CR1470-71.\n\nApp. B.\n\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\f      All the evidence supports the opposite of the jury’s finding to omit the\n\ncharities’ settlement amount from the damages awarded. The Archers’ evidence of\n\nthe amounts paid to settle with the twelve charities was uncontroverted and\n\nsupported only one inference. A reasonable jury could not have disregarded the\n\nundisputed evidence of $588,054 as the damages paid to settle with the charities.\n\nAccordingly, the Archers proved the $588,054 settlement with the charities as a\n\nmatter of law. The district court correctly granted Appellants’ motion for partial\n\nJNOV.\n\n      Accordingly, whether based on Appellants’ waiver of Issue 5 or the correct\n\nruling of the district court, Appellants’ Issue 5 should be overruled and the Archers’\n\nCross Issue 2 sustained.\n\nIV.   The district court properly calculated prejudgment interest. [Responsive\n      to Issues 6 & 7]\n\n      The district court calculated prejudgment interest from August 4, 2003\n\nthrough the date of the Final Judgment. CR1470-71, 1461. App. B, K. Appellants\n\nargue that the district court used an incorrect accrual date and that prejudgment\n\ninterest should have been tolled. Appellants’ first argument is waived, and their\n\nsecond argument is refuted by well-established law.\n\n      This Court reviews a prejudgment interest award, and in particular the accrual\n\ndate, under an abuse of discretion standard. Wilmer-Hutchins Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nSmiley, 97 S.W.3d 702, 707 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, pet. denied); Brookshire\n                                         65\n\fGrocery Co. v. Smith, 99 S.W.3d 819, 823-25 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2003, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n      A.      Appellants waived their prejudgment interest accrual date\n              argument.\n\n      Without citing authority or to the record, Appellants contend that “Appellees\n\nshould not collect prejudgment interest until after filing this suit on July 26, 2007.”\n\nAppts. Br. at 33. Because Appellants fail to cite any authority, or to the record, and\n\nfail to offer any cogent argument, their first argument is waived. See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 38.1(i).   Specifically, a party waives its challenge to the starting date for\n\ncalculation of prejudgment interest by failing to cite “authority to support its\n\ncalculation or its assertion of a different starting date.” Wilmer-Hutchins Indep. Sch.\n\nDist., 97 S.W.3d at 707.\n\n      Alternatively, even considering Appellants’ waived argument, the accrual\n\ndate for a prejudgment interest calculation is clear. Prejudgment interest begins\n\naccruing the earlier of: (1) 180 days after receipt of written notice of a claim, or (2)\n\nthe date suit was filed. Johnson & Higgins of Tex., Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc.,\n\n962 S.W.2d 507, 528-31, n. 9; TEX. FIN. CODE §§ 304.101; 304.104.\n\n      After learning that Jack’s estate plan had been changed, the Archers filed suit\n\nfor tortious interference with inheritance against Ted and others in the Bexar County\n\nGuardianship Proceeding on February 5, 2003. CR98-117. That filing put Ted on\n\n\n\n                                          66\n\fnotice of the Archers’ claim for tortious interference with inheritance claim for\n\npurposes of the prejudgment interest calculation.\n\n      Without authority, Appellants argue that the Archers could not give notice of\n\ntheir claim until Jack died. Appts. Br. at 33. Contrary to Appellants’ argument, the\n\nArchers tortious interference claim, and the time to file a lawsuit on the claim, arose\n\nlong before Jack died.\n\n      If a will disinherits a person, a will contest can only be brought after a person\n\ndies. TEX. ESTATES CODE §§256.002 (probate of a will of a living person is void),\n\n256.204 (will can only be contested after it is admitted to probate). The theory being\n\nthat a will can be revoked or revised until a person dies.\n\n      The Archers, however, were disinherited in three wills and in a trust. 6RR24;\n\n11RRPlx166, Plx171, Plx172, Plx192, Plx194. All of Jack’s assets were placed in\n\nthe Trust, and when it terminated on Jack’s death, all of the assets were to be divided\n\nsolely among the charities. 6RR153; 11RRPlx171 at 2-3. Because the Trust\n\ninstrument disinherited the Archers, the Archers had to challenge the Trust’s validity\n\n(because of Jack’s lack of capacity to sign it) instead of waiting for Jack to die and\n\nbring a will contest. 6RR70-71.\n\n      The Archers discovered the Trust that disinherited them in early 2001.\n\n3RR149; 11RRPlx171; 12RRPlx218. Tortious interference with inheritance has a\n\ntwo-year statute of limitations. See Hawkins v. Walvoord, 25 S.W.3d 882, 888 (Tex.\n\n\n                                          67\n\fApp.—El Paso 2000, pet. denied) (cause of action sounding in tort governed by two-\n\nyear statute of limitations).\n\n      There was a further complicating fact. Jack’s attorneys stipulated that Jack\n\nwas incapacitated as of February 7, 2002. 11RRPlx34. After that date, Jack could\n\nnot have validly signed a new will or trust. Thus, by February 7, 2002, Jack’s estate\n\nplan was set.\n\n      The Archers faced two dates that started the statute of limitations on their\n\ntortious interference with inheritance claim running: the discovery of the Trust and\n\nthe date of the stipulation of incapacity. The Archers filed suit within two years of\n\nthe earlier date—the discovery the Trust that disinherited them. CR98-117.\n\n      The district court applied the well-established law and calculated prejudgment\n\ninterest from August 4, 2003, 180 days after the Archers filed their original lawsuit\n\nagainst Ted in Bexar County for tortious interference with inheritance. Appellants\n\noffer no legal authority or argument for abandoning the well-established\n\njurisprudence on accrual dates for prejudgment interest calculation. Appts. Br. at\n\n33. Thus, even if not waived, the district court did not abuse its discretion in using\n\nAugust 4, 2003 as the accrual date.\n\n      B.     Prejudgment interest cannot be tolled.\n\n      Contrary to Appellants’ argument, a trial court cannot toll prejudgment\n\ninterest. The Texas Supreme Court has held that “the trial court no discretion to\n\n\n                                         68\n\flessen or increase the interest amount for delays caused by either party.” Matthews\n\nv. DeSoto, 721 S.W.2d 286, 287 (Tex. 1986) (emphasis added).\n\n         Appellants cite four cases in support of their argument that the trial court has\n\ndiscretion to “consider periods of delay caused by the plaintiffs.” Appts. Br. at 34.\n\nAll four cases expressly relied on the since-repealed Finance Code §304.108 or its\n\npredecessor, TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ART. 5069-1.05, §6. Helena Chemical v. Wilkins,\n\n18 S.W.3d 744,760 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2000), affirmed, 47 S.W. 3d 486 (Tex.\n\n2001); Aquila Southwest Pipeline, Inc. v. Harmony Exploration, Inc., 48 S.W.3d\n\n225, 242 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, pet. denied); Southwest Airlines v. Jaeger,\n\n867 S.W.2d 824, 837 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1993, writ denied); and Johnson &\n\nHiggins of Texas Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962 S.W.2d 507, 529-32 (Tex. 1998).\n\n         Under former Finance Code §304.108(b), a trial court could, in its discretion,\n\ntoll prejudgment interest in wrongful death, personal injury, and property damage\n\ncases.     AMX Enters., L.L.P. v. Master Realty Corp., 283 S.W.3d 506, 511 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 2009, no pet.). The legislature, however, repealed §304.108(b) in\n\n2003. Id. 11 The 2003 repeal of Finance Code §304.108 stripped trial courts of any\n\n\n\n\n11\n  The legislature’s action applies “in any case in which a final judgment is signed or subject to\nappeal on or after the effective date of this Act.” Act of May 16, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 204, §\n6.04, 2003 TEX. GEN. LAWS 847, 862. The Act took effect on September 1, 2003, Act of June 2,\n2003, 78 Leg., R.S., ch. 204, § 23.02(a), 2003 TEX. GEN. LAWS 847, 898-99.\n\n                                                69\n\fdiscretion to toll prejudgment interest during periods of delay. Id. Trial courts also\n\nhave no equitable power to toll prejudgment interest. Id.\n\n         The repeal of the repeal of Finance Code §304.108(b) leaves the common law\n\nin place. Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. v. Burnett, No. 12-10-00037, 2012 WL 381714, at\n\n*14-15 (Tex. App.—Tyler Feb. 3, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.). Under the common\n\nlaw, “the trial court has no discretion to lessen or increase the interest amount [or\n\notherwise toll the accrual of prejudgment interest] for delays caused by either party.”\n\nId. (citing Matthews v. DeSoto, 721 S.W.2d at 287).\n\n         Accordingly, the district court properly refused to toll prejudgment interest.\n\nThis Court should overrule Appellants’ Issues Six and Seven.\n\n                                PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n         For these reasons, Appellees/Cross-Appellants respectfully request that this\n\nCourt:\n\n         - affirm the Final Judgment as to liability;\n\n         - sustain their Cross Issue 1, and render judgment for their total attorney’s fees\n         paid in the prior litigation of $2,865,928, as proved as a matter of law, in\n         addition to the $588,054 awarded by the district court in post-verdict motions,\n         for a total damages of $3,453,982; and\n\n         - direct the district court (by mandate or remand) to recalculate the judgment\n         in light of the new damage amount awarded on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             70\n\f      Alternatively, Appellees/Cross-Appellants request that the Court affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s Final Judgment on liability and damages.

This case is submitted to you by asking questions about the facts, which you must\n\n    decide from the evidence admitted in this trial.\n\n            2.       In arriving at your answers, consider only the evidence, including exhibits,\n\n    admitted in this trial.\n\n            3.       In considering this evidence, you are bound to follow the law set forth in this\n\n    charge, as well as all instructions concerning jurors' conduct that you have been given.\n\n            4.       You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges of\n\n    the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But on matters of law, you\n\n    must follow all of my instructions.\n\n            5.       Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.\n\n            6.       Do not become a secret witness by telling other jurors about other incidents,\n\n    experiences, or lawsuits. Do not tell other jurors about any special knowledge, information, or\n\n    expertise that YCJifltm~~ ffie'tOis~Pe\\3lHf confine your deliberat~tf?t tftre~f~~ft;g&fitted in the\n      .               of Travis County, Texas                         of Travis County Texas\n    tna.1                                                                             '\n                              MAY 22 2013\n                    At        ~:Ii{)    e          M.\n                     Amalia Rodriguez-Mendoza, Cieri<\n                                                                                                     1\n\n\n                                                                             646\n\f                                            DC      BK13164 PG155\n\n\n\n\n        7.       This charge includes all legal instructions and definitions that are necessary to\n\nassist you 1n reaching your verdict, so do not seek out any information in law books or\n\ndictionaries.\n\n        8.       All of the questions and answers are important.          No one should say that any\n\nquestion or answer is not important.\n\n        9.       Do not decide who you think should win and then try to answer the questions\n\naccordingly. Simply answer the questions, and do not concern yourselves with the effect of your\n\nanswers.\n\n        10.      Do not decide the questions by any method of chance.\n\n        11.      Do not answer the questions by adding together each juror's figure and dividing\n\nby the number of jurors to get an average.\n\n        12.      Do not do any trading on your answers. That is, one juror must not agree to\n\nanswer one question a certain way if other jurors will agree to answer another question another\n\nway.\n\n        13.      After you retire to the jury room, you will select a presiding juror. You will then\n\ndeliberate upon your answers.\n\n        14.      It is the duty of that presiding juror:\n                a.      to preside during the deliberations and to provide order and compliance\n                        with the charge;\n                b.      to write, sign, and deliver to the court clerk any communication to me;\n                c.      to conduct the vote and to participate in that vote; and,\n                d.      to write your answers in the spaces provided.\n\n\n                Do you understand the duties of the presiding juror? If you do not, please tell me\nnow.\n        15.     The answers to the questions must be based on the decision of at least 10 of the 12\n\nJurors. The same 10 jurors must agree on every part of an answer, including subparts, unless\n\notherwise instructed. Do not agree to be bound by a vote of anything less than 10 jurors, even if it\n\nwould be a majority.\n                                                                                                  2\n\n\n                                                                    647\n\f                                            DC         BK13164 PG156\n\n\n\n\n        16.      If the verdict is reached by unanimous agreement, the presiding juror will sign the\n\nverdict on the certificate page for the entire jury.\n\n        17.      If 10 jurors agree on every answer, those 10 jurors sign the verdict. If 11 jurors\n\nagree on every answer, those 11 jurors sign the verdict. If all 12 of you agree on every answer,\n\nyou are unanimous and only the presiding juror signs the verdict.\n\n        18.      During your service as jurors, if you observe a violation of my instructions outside\n\nthe jury room, by either a juror or any other person, you must report that to me.\n\n        19.      In your deliberations, any juror who observes a violation of my instructions shall\n\npoint out the violation and caution the offending juror not to violate the instructions again.\n\n       20.       You must not discuss the case with anyone, including other members of the jury,\n\nunless all of the jurors are present and assembled in the jury room. If anyone other than a juror\n\ntries to talk to you about the case before you reach a verdict, tell me immediately.\n\n       21.       When all required questions have been answered, the presiding juror has written\n\nyour answers on the charge, and the verdict has been signed, you will summon the court clerk and\n\nbe returned to court with your verdict.\n\n       When words are used in this charge in a sense which varies from the meaning commonly\n\nunderstood, you are given a proper legal definition, which you are bound to accept in place of any\n\nother meaning.\n\n       Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to all questions unless otherwise instructed. A \"Yes\" answer must\n\nbe based on a preponderance of the evidence unless otherwise instructed. If you do not find that a\n\npreponderance of the evidence supports a \"Yes\" answer, then answer \"No\".\n\n       The term \"PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE\" means the greater weight and\n\ndegree of credible testimony or evidence introduced before you and admitted in this case. A\n\npreponderance of the evidence is not measured by the number of witnesses or by the number of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   3\n\n\n                                                                       648\n\f                                               DC      BK13164 PG157\n\n\n•\n\n\n\n\n    documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, you\n\n    must find that the fact is more likely true than not.\n\n              A fact may be established by \"DIRECT EVIDENCE\" or by \"CIRCUMSTANTIAL\n\n    EVIDENCE\" or both. A fact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary\n\n    evidence or by witnesses who saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established\n\n    by circumstantial evidence when it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts\n\n    proved.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 4\n\n\n                                                                       649\n\f                                             DC     BK13164 PG158\n\n\n•\n\n\n\n                                           QUESTION NO. 1\n\n    Did Ted Anderson tortiously interfere with the Plaintiffs' inheritance from Jack Archer?\n\n           \"Tortious interference\" occurs when one, who by undue influence, duress, breach of\n           fiduciary duties, or other wrongful means, intentionally prevents another from receiving\n           an inheritance or gift that they would otherwise have received.\n\n           \"Undue influence\" means that an influence existed and was exerted, the influence\n           undermined or overpowered the mind of the person executing the documents at the time\n           of their execution, and the person would not have executed the documents but for the\n           influence.\n\n           \"Duress\" is any coercion, whether mental, physical, or otherwise, which causes another\n           person to act contrary to his own free will or to submit to a situation or a condition\n           against his own volition or interest.\n\n           \"Breach of fiduciary duty\" occurs where influence has been acquired and abused, and\n           confidence has been reposed and betrayed.\n\n           An attorney and an attorney-in-fact owe fiduciary duties. Fiduciary duties may also arise\n           out of an informal relationship, whether the relationship is a moral, social, domestic, or\n           purely personal one, such as where a person that is of advanced age and in poor health\n           relies on and trusts another person for support.\n\n\n\n                  Answer \"Yes\" or \"No.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   5\n\n\n                                                                    650\n\f                                              DC      BK13164 PG159\n\n\n•\n\n\n    If you answered \"Yes\" to Question No. 1, then answer the following question.

In order to be a proximate\n           cause, the act or omission complained of must be such that a person using the degree of\n           care required of him would have fore seen that the event, or some similar event, might\n           reasonably result therefrom. There may be more than one proximate cause.\n\n           Consider the following element of damages and none other: the difference in value, if\n           any, of the inheritance actually received by Plaintiffs and the value of the inheritance that\n           Plaintiffs would have received from Jack Archer had there been no interference by the\n           Defendant.\n\n    Answer in dollars and cents, if any.\n\n           Answer:~ a?~ /5?'~                      c;:i?\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      6\n\n\n                                                                      651\n\f                                                DC      BK13164 PG160\n\n\n\n\n                                     Cause No. D-1-GN-07-002328\n\nRICHARD T.

The judgment\nsets out a recovery for Pat of his attorney's fees against\nMozelle, and also specifically denies Mozelle's mo-\ntion for judgment non obstante veredicto. In this mo-\ntion Mozelle had requested judgment over against Pat,\nand a denial of this relief effectively disposes of this\nissue. This assignment is overruled.\n\n\n     The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals in so\nfar as it allows Pat to recover an attorney's fee from\nMozelle is reversed and judgment here rendered that\nPat take nothing against Mozelle as to this item.\n\n\n\n\n                             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

M ANDERSON'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL JUDGMENT\n                  NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT\n\n\nTO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE COURT:\n\n       Defendants, T. Mark Anderson, Individually and as co-executor of the Estate of Ted\n\nAnderson, and Christine Anderson, as co-executor of the Estate of Ted M. Anderson file this their\n\nMotion for Partial Judgment Not Withstanding the Verdict, respectfully showing the Court the\n\nfollowing:\n\n                           PROCEDURAL AND FACT SUMMARY\n\n       This case was submitted to the jury on two issues, liability for tortious interference with\n\ninheritance, and damages. The jury found for Plaintiffs on liability and in the single blank under the\n\nquestion on damages wrote in the amount of $2,006,150.\n\n       Plaintiffs evidence on damages consisted of their claim for $588,054 which testimony\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         1210\n\findicated was the amount paid by Plaintiffs to certain charities to secure a settlement with those\n\ncharities to avoid a will contest, and their claim for $2,865,928 in attorneys' fees and expenses paid\n\nin all the prior litigation in the guardianship proceedings which included the litigation with the\n\ncharities. Defendants asserted from the outset that Plaintiffs have no viable claim for recovery of\n\nattorneys' fees as damages in this action, sought to exclude testimony on such damages, objected to\n\nsuch testimony and sought a partial directed verdict on the issue. Because Defendants assert that\n\nTexas law does not permit the recovery of attorneys' fees as damages in a tort case like this one, and\n\nin the alternative, Defendants assert Plaintiffs' evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury's\n\naward of attorneys' fees as part of the Plaintiffs' damages, Defendants bring this motion.\n\n                               ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n        1. Standard for granting a partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n\n        A partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict is proper if a directed verdict would have\n\nbeen proper. TEX. R. Crv. P. 301. If, as a matter oflaw, the claimant's evidence does not\n\ndescribe a cause of action recognized in Texas, the court may grant a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment. Further the court may disregard any jury finding on a question that has no support in\n\nthe evidence. Id\n\n\n      2. Texas has not adopted the \"tort of another\" exception to the general rule on\nrecovery of attorneys' fees as damages.\n\n        In Turner v. Turner, the case relied upon by Plaintiffs, the supreme court discussed,\n\nwithout expressly adopting, that exception to the general rule that attorney's fees are not\n\navailable as actual damages. Turner v. Turner, 385 S.W. 2d. 230, 234 (Tex. 1965). In Turner,\n\nthe court that the claimant did not meet the criteria of the theory upon which he was\n\n                                                   2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           1211\n\fexpressly relying, and therefore denied his claim for attorneys' fees, without any comment\n\non whether the theory was valid. Id. In 2009, the Texas Supreme Court clarified its earlier\n\nopinion in Turner by stating, \"... we need not and do not address whether the ['tort of\n\nanother'] exception set out in section 914(2) of the Second Restatement should be adopted\n\nas Texas law. Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. v. Nat' l Dev. and Research Corp., 299\n\nS.W.3d 106, 119 (Tex. 2009).\n\n        Texas intermediate appellate courts are divided on whether section 914(2) is the law\n\nin Texas. Compare Naschke v. Gulf Coast Conference, 187 S.W.3d 653, 655 (Tex.App.-Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (declining to adopt tort of another exception in section 914(2));\n\nPeterson v.

Zanes & Co., 354 S.W.2d 621, 624\n\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1962, no writ), with Lesikar v. Rappeport, 33 S.W.3d 282, 306 (Tex.\n\nApp .-Texarkana 2000, pet. denied) (adopted tort of another exception under Restatement\n\nsection 914(2)); Estate ofArlitt v.

Ball, 669 S.W.2d 836, 839 (Tex.App.-\n\nEastland 1984, no writ); Powell v. Narried, 463 S.W.2d 43, 46 (Tex.Civ.App.-El Paso 1971,\n\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    1212\n\f       As the 14th District Court of Appeals declared in declining to adopt an equitable\n\nexception to the general rule against recovery of attorneys' fees from prior litigation with\n\nothers as damages, \"Because we are bound to follow the existing laws of the State, we are\n\nnot at liberty to adopt a theory of recovery that has not been enacted by the Legislature or\n\nadopted by the Texas Supreme Court.\"              Naschke, 187 S.W.3d at 655.    Defendants\n\nrespectfully assert that the clearest and strongest authority is that the \"tort of another\"\n\nexception, embodied in Restatement of Torts§ 914(2) (1979), the Legislature or the Supreme\n\nis not the law of the State of Texas. For that reason alone, Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial\n\nJudgment NOV must fail.\n\n      3. Plaintiffs did not discharge their burden of proof for recovery of attorneys' fees\nas damages.\n\n       Even is the Court determines that attorneys' fees are an available element of\n\ndamages, which Defendants deny, Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof.\n\n\n              A. Plaintiffs had a duty to segregate recoverable from non-recoverable fees.\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly held that \"a prevailing party must\n\nsegregate recoverable from unrecoverable attorney's fees in all cases.\" Varner v. Cardenas,\n\n218 S.W.3d 68, 69 (Tex. 2007) (per curiam); A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. v. Beyer, 235 S.W.3d\n\n704, 710 (Tex. 2007); Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313-14 (Tex. 2006);\n\nStewart Title Guar. Co. v. Aiello, 941 S.W.2d 68, 73 (Tex. 1997); Stewart Title Guar. Co. v.\n\nSterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991); Matthews v. Candlewood Builders, Inc., 685 S.W.2d 649,\n\n650 (Tex. 1985).   An attorney may segregate either by (1) proving time spent on a\n\n\n                                              4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 1213\n\frecoverable claim and excluding time spent on a non-recoverable claim, or (2) subtracting a\n\npercentage of the time from the total time expended on the case to account time spent on\n\nthe unrecoverable claim. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. at 314.\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs argue they are exempt from the need to segregate because of the\n\nrecognized exception for so called inextricably intertwined legal services. Defendants\n\nassert Plaintiffs do not qualify for the exception in this case. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\nheld that when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim,\n\nand the claims are so intertwined that it is impossible to determine which part of the\n\nattorney's work is attributable to a non-recoverable claim, no segregation is required. Id at\n\n313-14. But where attorney's fees \"relate solely to a claim for which ... fees are\n\nunrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.\" Id. The\n\nSupreme Court explained that a common set of underlying facts is insufficient to make all\n\nclaims arising therefrom 'inseparable' and all legal fees recoverable. Id.\n\n              B. Plaintiffs failed as a matter of law to meet their burden to segregate.\n\n       In our case, Plaintiffs' evidence showed they brought claims against a number of\n\nindividuals in the guardianship action which had nothing to do with their claim of tortious\n\ninterference with inheritance rights against Ted Anderson. For example, they spent a great\n\ndeal of time in pursuit of legal malpractice claims against many defendants, for which the\n\nprobate court and the court of appeals ruled they had no standing. Also, Plaintiffs sought\n\ndamages on behalf of Jack Archer's estate for alleged negligence by Mr. J. R. Hamilton, the\n\n\n                                              5\n\n\n\n                                                                                                1214\n\ftemporary guardian of his estate. In addition, they pursued and settled claims for the\n\nestate against Mr. Doug Hearne for his handling of funds in his law firm's trust accounts\n\nwhich they claimed should have administered by the guardian of the estate. They sued Mr.\n\nBuster Adame, another attorney for Jack Archer; and they sued Ms. Pamela Rucker, the\n\ntemporary guardian of the person of Jack Archer. None of these claims involved Mr.\n\nAnderson.     Plaintiffs presented no evidence of, and did not seek jury findings of a\n\nconspiracy between Mr. Anderson and any other persons they pursued in the probate\n\ncourt.\n\n               C. Plaintiffs evidence is legally insufficient to show reasonableness and\n\nnecessity.\n\n         Plaintiffs had the burden to prove the attorneys fees sought were reasonable and\n\nnecessary. Stewart Title Guaranty Company v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1992). Texas\n\nfollows the lodestar method for awarding attorneys' fees. El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370\n\nS.W.3d 757, 760 (Tex.2012). This method is required in cases involving contingent fee\n\ncontracts. Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818-19 (Tex. 1997). In\n\nArthur Andersen, a DTPA case, the Texas Supreme Court made clear that a party seeking\n\nattorneys' fees must do more than present a contingent fee contract and make conclusory\n\nstatements regarding the reasonableness and necessity of the fees. Factors that a factfinder\n\nshould consider when determining the reasonableness of a fee include:\n\n(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and\n\nthe skill required to perform the legal service properly;\n\n\n                                              6\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 1215\n\f(2) the likelihood ... that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other\n\nemployment by the lawyer;\n\n(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;\n\n(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;\n\n(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;\n\n(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services;\n\nand\n\n(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or uncertainty of collection\n\nbefore the legal services have been rendered.

M ANDERSON'S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT\n NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT, AND IN THE ALTERNATIVE, AMENDED\n   MOTION FOR PARTIAL JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT\n\n\nTO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE COURT:\n\n       Defendants, T. Mark Anderson, Individually and as co-executor of the Estate of Ted\n\nAnderson, and Christine Anderson, as co-executor of the Estate of Ted M. Anderson file this their\n\nMotion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, and in the alternative, Amended Motion for\n\nPartial Judgment Not Withstanding the Verdict, respectfully showing the Court the following:\n\n                           PROCEDURAL AND FACT SUMMARY\n\n       This case was submitted to the jury on two issues, liability for tortious interference with\n\ninheritance, and damages. The jury found for Plaintiffs on liability and in the single blank under the\n\nquestion on damages wrote in the amount of $2,006,150.\n\n       Plaintiffs' alleged damages consisted of their claim for $588,054 which testimony indicated\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         1264\n\fwas the amount paid by Plaintiffs to certain charities to secure a settlement with those charities to\n\navoid a will contest, and their claim for $2,865,928 in attorneys' fees and expenses paid in all the\n\nprior litigation in the guardianship proceedings which included the litigation with the charities.\n\nDefendants assert that Texas law does not recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with\n\ninheritance, as it has never been adopted by the Legislature or the Texas Supreme Court. In the\n\nalternative, and without waiving their right to challenge the legal basis for Plaintiffs' cause of action,\n\nDefendants would show that Plaintiffs have no viable claim for recovery of attorneys' fees as\n\ndamages in this action.\n\n  STANDARD FOR GRANTING MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING\n                          THE VERDICT\n\n\n        1.. If a plaintiff asserts a claim based on a cause of action which is not recognized in\n\nTexas, the trial court is authorized to grant a summary judgment against the plaintiff as to such a\n\nclaim. Helena Labs. v. Snyder, 886 S.W.2d 767, 768-69 (Tex. 1994) (affirming summary\n\njudgment against plaintiff who asserted a cause of action for negligent interference with family\n\nrelationship), the court may grant a motion for summary judgment. The standard is the same for\n\na motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. A judgment notwithstanding the verdict is\n\nproper if a directed verdict would have been proper. Tex. R. Civ. P. 301. Further the court may\n\ndisregard any jury finding on a question that has no support in the evidence. Id\n\n\n                               ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n                       Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict\n\n       2. As a matter of law, Texas does not recognize tortious interference with\ninheritance as a cognizable cause of action.\n\n\n                                                    2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             1265\n\f      It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme Court of Texas not only has thus far\n\nfailed to recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with inheritance rights,\n\nbut that it never will. . Neither the Texas Supreme Court nor the Texas Legislature has\n\nadopted RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS §77 4B (1979). Plaintiffs' only authorities for\n\nthe submission of this cause are cases decided by intermediate courts of appeals and\n\nnot considered by the Supreme Court. See Kjng v. Acker, 725 S.W 2d 750 (Tex App.-\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1987, no writ; and Meduna v. Holder, No. 03-06-00484-CV, 2008 WL\n\n2 (Tex. App.-Austin April 30, 2008, pet. denied), the latter case not reported in\n\nSouthwest Reporter.\n\n      Even if the Supreme Court of Texas were to deem it advisable to permit plaintiffs\n\nto sue certain classes or types of defendants for tortious interference with inheritance,\n\nit would not do so as to attorneys at law. Texas has a bright line privity rule with\n\nrespect to claims which can be asserted against an attorney who, like this Defendant,\n\nhas prepared trusts or wills for a client. In Barcelo v. EJHott, 923 S.W.2d 575 (Tex.\n\n1996), the Supreme Court of Texas extensively analyzed the public policy\n\nconsiderations involved in permitting persons who were intended beneficiaries under a\n\nwill or trust to file a negligence claims against the attorney who represented the\n\ntestator or settlor in drafting the will or trust. Our Supreme Court held that:\n\n      \"In sum, we are unable to craft a bright-line rule that allows a lawsuit to proceed\n\nwhere alleged malpractice causes a will or trust to fail in a manner that casts no real\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\n\n\n                                                                                            1266\n\fdoubt on the testator's intentions, while inhibiting actions in other situations. We\n\nbelieve the greater good is served by preserving a bright-line privity rule that denies a\n\ncause of action to all beneficiaries whom the attorney did not represent This will\n\nensure that attorneys may in all causes zealously represent their clients without the\n\nthreat of suit from third parties compromising that representation.\" Id at 579\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       While the evidence showed that Ted Anderson and Jack Archer had been friends\n\nfor over 35 years, and that Mr. Anderson did not request or receive any compensation\n\nor benefits for assisting his friend Mr. Archer after his stroke, Plaintiffs repeatedly\n\ncharacterized him as acting in the capacity of an attorney at laws, and presented an\n\nexpert to criticize his conduct under the standard of care of attorneys at law. Under the\n\ncircumstances, Mr. Anderson should be accorded the protections of the rule laid down\n\nin Barcelo.\n\n    3. Texas has not adopted the \"tort of another\" exception to the general rule on\n   recovery of attorneys' fees as damages.\n\n       In the event the Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs have pleaded and proved a cause\n\nof action recognized in Texas law, which Defendants deny, in the alternative, and without\n\nwaiving their rights to appeal either the viability of Plaintiffs legal theories of this case, or\n\nthe method of its submission to the jury, Defendants would respectfully show the court\n\nthat a significant portion of the damages found by the jury is fatally flawed and lacks\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    1267\n\fsupport in the law. Plaintiffs are not entitled to claim their attorneys fees and expenses\n\nfrom the Bexar County Probate Court as damages in this case.\n\n       In Turner v. Turner, the case relied upon by Plaintiffs, the supreme court discussed,\n\nwithout expressly adopting, that exception to the general rule that attorney's fees are not\n\navailable as actual damages. Turner v. Turner, 385 S.W. 2d. 230, 234 (Tex. 1965). In Turner,\n\nthe court that the claimant did not meet the criteria of the theory upon which he was\n\nexpressly relying, and therefore denied his claim for attorneys' fees, without any comment\n\non whether the theory was valid. Id. In 2009, the Texas Supreme Court clarified its earlier\n\nopinion in Turner by stating, \"... we need not and do not address whether the ['tort of\n\nanother'] exception set out in section 914(2) of the Second Restatement should be adopted\n\nas Texas law. Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. v. Nat' l Dev. and Research Corp., 299\n\nS.W.3d 106, 119 (Tex. 2009).\n\n       Texas intermediate appellate courts are divided on whether section 914(2) is the law\n\nin Texas. Compare Naschke v. Gulf Coast Conference, 187 S.W.3d 653, 655 (Tex.App.-Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (declining to adopt tort of another exception in section 914(2));\n\nPeterson v.

Narried, 463 S.W.2d 43, 46 (Tex.Civ.App.-El Paso 1971,\n\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.).\n\n        As the 14th District Court of Appeals declared in declining to adopt an equitable\n\nexception to the general rule against recovery of attorneys' fees from prior litigation with\n\nothers as damages, \"Because we are bound to follow the existing laws of the State, we are\n\nnot at liberty to adopt a theory of recovery that has not been enacted by the Legislature or\n\nadopted by the Texas Supreme Court.\"              Naschke, 187 S.W.3d at 655.   Defendants\n\nrespectfully assert that the clearest and strongest authority is that the \"tort of another\"\n\nexception, embodied in Restatement of Torts§ 914(2) (1979), the Legislature or the Supreme\n\nis not the law of the State of Texas. For that reason alone, Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial\n\nJudgment NOV must fail.\n\n      4. Plaintiffs did not discharge their burden of proof for recovery of attorneys' fees\nas damages.\n\n        Even is the Court determines that attorneys' fees are an available element of\n\ndamages, which Defendants deny, Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof.\n\n\n                A. Plaintiffs had a duty to segregate recoverable from non-recoverable fees.\n\n        The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly held that \"a prevailing party must\n\nsegregate recoverable from unrecoverable attorney's fees in all cases.\" Varner v. Cardenas,\n\n\n                                              6\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               1269\n\f218 S.W.3d 68, 69 (Tex. 2007) (per curiam); A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. v. Beyer, 235 S.W.3d\n\n704, 710 (Tex. 2007); Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313-14 (Tex. 2006);\n\nStewart Title Guar. Co. v. Aiello, 941 S.W.2d 68, 73 (Tex. 1997); Stewart Title Guar. Co. v.\n\nSterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991); Matthews v. Candlewood Builders, Inc., 685 S.W.2d 649,\n\n650 (Tex. 1985).   An attorney may segregate either by (1) proving time spent on a\n\nrecoverable claim and excluding time spent on a non-recoverable claim, or (2) subtracting a\n\npercentage of the time from the total time expended on the case to account time spent on\n\nthe unrecoverable claim. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. at 314.\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs argue they are exempt from the need to segregate because of the\n\nrecognized exception for so called inextricably intertwined legal services. Defendants\n\nassert Plaintiffs do not qualify for the exception in this case. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\nheld that when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim,\n\nand the claims are so intertwined that it is impossible to determine which part of the\n\nattorney's work is attributable to a non-recoverable claim, no segregation is required. Id at\n\n313-14. But where attorney's fees \"relate solely to a claim for which ... fees are\n\nunrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.\" Id. The\n\nSupreme Court explained that a common set of underlying facts is insufficient to make all\n\nclaims arising therefrom 'inseparable' and all legal fees recoverable. Id.\n\n              B. Plaintiffs failed as a matter of law to meet their burden to segregate.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 1270\n\f         In our case, Plaintiffs' evidence showed they brought claims against a number of\n\nindividuals in the guardianship action which had nothing to do with their claim of tortious\n\ninterference with inheritance rights against Ted Anderson. For example, they spent a great\n\ndeal of time in pursuit of legal malpractice claims against many defendants, for which the\n\nprobate court and the court of appeals ruled they had no standing. Also, Plaintiffs sought\n\ndamages on behalf of Jack Archer's estate for alleged negligence by Mr. J. R. Hamilton, the\n\ntemporary guardian of his estate. In addition, they pursued and settled claims for the\n\nestate against Mr. Doug Hearne for his handling of funds in his law firm's trust accounts\n\nwhich they claimed should have administered by the guardian of the estate. They sued Mr.\n\nBuster Adame, another attorney for Jack Archer; and they sued Ms. Pamela Rucker, the\n\ntemporary guardian of the person of Jack Archer. None of these claims involved Mr.\n\nAnderson.     Plaintiffs presented no evidence of, and did not seek jury findings of a\n\nconspiracy between Mr. Anderson and any other persons they pursued in the probate\n\ncourt.\n\n               C. Plaintiffs evidence is legally insufficient to show reasonableness and\n\nnecessity.\n\n         Plaintiffs had the burden to prove the attorneys fees sought were reasonable and\n\nnecessary. Stewart Title Guaranty Company v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1992). Texas\n\nfollows the lodestar method for awarding attorneys' fees. El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370\n\nS.W.3d 757, 760 (Tex.2012). This method is required in cases involving contingent fee\n\ncontracts. Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818-19 (Tex. 1997).\n\n\n                                             8\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              1271\n\fIn Arthur Andersen, a DTPA case, the Texas Supreme Court made clear that a party\n\nseeking attorneys' fees must do more than present a contingent fee contract and make\n\nconclusory statements regarding the reasonableness and necessity of the fees. Factors that\n\na factfinder should consider when determining the reasonableness of a fee include:\n\n(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and\n\nthe skill required to perform the legal service properly;\n\n(2) the likelihood ... that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other\n\nemployment by the lawyer;\n\n(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;\n\n(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;\n\n(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;\n\n(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services;\n\nand\n\n(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or uncertainty of collection\n\nbefore the legal services have been rendered.

McFARLEN:   My position actually on --\n\n10   including breach of fiduciary duty is the state of the\n\n11   evidence is that, you know, it's -- that the actual\n\n12   breach testified to is the exact, same evidence.         Again,\n\n13   it goes to undue; influence.\n\n14                    Essentially, there are witnesses saying --\n\n15   aside from -- when you said -- two things.        And he said,\n\n16   breach his fiduciary duty by taking the power of\n\n17   attorney, because I don't think that that's within the\n\n18   standard of care for a lawyer to take a power of\n\n19   attorney from a client -- in this case, his former\n\n20   client.     I think that's not very credible.\n\n21                    But he -- part of his assumption or one of\n\n22   his assumptions, part of his basis for that opinion is\n\n23   that Mr. Archer, he accepted the assumption, the\n\n24   testimony of plaintiffs' expert medical witnesses, that\n\n25   Mr. Archer never had capacity after he suffered the\n\f                   Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013                 89\n                 Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1   stroke.\n\n 2                 And I think -- that evidence is, of\n\n 3   course, very much in dispute.\n\n 4                 So other than that, which is is that --\n\n 5   and that, in and of itself, cannot possibly be a\n\n 6   proximate cause of Mr. Archer changing his will.\n\n 7                 There really -- it looks to me like they\n\n 8   are just seeking a second bite at the same apple and an\n\n 9   opportunity to use the same bite that they got of the\n\n10   expert witness about breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n11                 Because the only other testimony -- the\n\n12   rest of his testimony regarding breach of fiduciary duty\n\n13   had to do with his assertion that my client was\n\n14   orchestrating a change of the will and that that -- you\n\n15   know, that that -- those actions, which the Court is\n\n16   already submitting it is undue influence, also amounted\n\n17   to a breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n18                 THE COURT:   We have.\n\n19                 I have struggled with submitting and I am\n\n20   concerned about submitting it this way just as a result\n\n21   of -- you know, depending on what the jury does.     And\n\n22   then if it goes up on appeal, how we can correct it\n\n23   without having to retry it all over again.\n\n24                 That's my concern about all of this.\n\n25                 MR. McFARLEN:     I understand.\n\f                      Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013                90\n                    Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1                    MS. RATLIFF:     On the breach of fiduciary\n\n 2   duty question, I mean, that definition, I mean,\n\n 3   throughout this time, Ted Anderson, Jack Archer had a\n\n 4   fiduciary relationship.     Whether it was under\n\n 5   attorney-client or power of attorney, or just an\n\n 6   informal relationship.     And that's something that\n\n 7   Mr. Boyce went into detail about, the three different\n\n 8   kinds of -- whether you have your law license or whether\n\n 9   you don't or whether you have power of attorney.\n\n10                    At the time he drafted the power of\n\n11   attorney, Ted was an attorney, a licensed attorney at\n\n12   that point.     It's inescapable to me how he can say, I\n\n13   drafted a document and I took it over there and had\n\n14   somebody sign it, that I don't have an attorney-client\n\n15   relationships right there.\n\n16                    Also, how many medical records do we see\n\n17   where it says Ted Anderson, attorney, Ted Anderson,\n\n18   attorney.     Even when he was not licensed.     All those\n\n19   hospital admittance, Pam Rucker, Ted Anderson.        How did\n\n20   they list him as?     Attorney.\n\n21                    He was very loose with that and how he got\n\n22   represented.     To me, it is his duty when he is no longer\n\n23   not a licensed attorney, he should have said, \"Don't\n\n24   call me that anymore.\"\n\n25                    But the evidence is replete that he was an\n\f                     Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013                     91\n                   Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1   attorney and that they had that relationship.        To\n\n 2   support --\n\n 3                    THE COURT:     Just because he's an attorney\n\n 4   doesn't mean he is his attorney, I mean, but --\n\n 5                    MS. RATLIFF:     But why would you list him\n\n 6   that way?\n\n 7                    THE COURT:     You know, a judge -- but they\n\n 8   still call me judge in the State of California.           I'm\n\n 9   still a judge.     It doesn't mean I can go over there and\n\n10   be a judge.\n\n11                    MS. RATLIFF:     I think it's a little\n\n12   different when you are talking about attorney-client\n\n13   relationships.\n\n14                    THE COURT:     And I understand that.     But\n\n15   that -- for our purposes here, though, the only reason I\n\n16   was saying that is we've got an attorney and an\n\n17   attorney, in fact, of fiduciary duties.\n\n18                    And so that was why I was asking, was\n\n19   there any dispute that he was either an attorney or an\n\n20   attorney in fact.     And see, that's why I was asking\n\n21   Mr. McFarlen that point.\n\n22                    MS. RATLIFF:     Or had a close relationship.\n\n23   And that's the second part of that because you have an\n\n24   informal relationship with somebody just, you know, my\n\n25   daughter and I, my husband and I.        That would be an\n\f                      Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013              92\n                    Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1   informal relationship that would rise to the level of\n\n 2   some fiduciary -- maybe not my husband, but -- that's a\n\n 3   bad example.\n\n 4                   But it was clear that he was in such a --\n\n 5   in a mental state that he was and everybody has\n\n 6   testified they were close friends and they relied on\n\n 7   each other.    I mean, that's right there, your informal\n\n 8   relationship to support -- I mean, a fiduciary duty.\n\n 9                   Your Honor, I hear your comment about how\n\n10   you submit this.     But, you know, every case that I read\n\n11   on tortuous interference, and there are actually a lot\n\n12   of them, they all list those -- I mean, fraud, duress.\n\n13                   THE COURT:     I realize that.\n\n14                   MS. RATLIFF:     It's very broad.   The courts\n\n15   of appeals continue to say that.       That's what they mean.\n\n16   They mean for it to be submitted that way.\n\n17                   And the Austin court of appeal in Medina\n\n18   actually quoted a little bit of what was in that charge.\n\n19   I realize that was in Blanco County.       But, I mean,\n\n20   that -- they put it all together.       They didn't try to,\n\n21   you know, cut that apart.\n\n22                   THE COURT:     Well, I was just concerned for\n\n23   purposes of an appeal.       And if the court of appeals\n\n24   thinks I was incorrect in submitting it at all, then we\n\n25   have to retry the whole case.\n\f                     Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013                   93\n                   Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1                    Unless we have them answer yes or no to\n\n 2   undue influence -- no, that's not going to work either.\n\n 3                    MS. RATLIFF:     I think -- I thought about\n\n 4   that, too.    Castillo.   It doesn't raise Castillo because\n\n 5   it is one cause of action.        It is tortuous interference\n\n 6   with inheritance.     Period.\n\n 7                    We don't have three different causes of\n\n 8   action.   It's one.    To me, those have to be defined.        It\n\n 9   means X, Y, Z.     You have to tell them what Y,X and Z\n\n10   mean.\n\n11                    THE COURT:     Okay.   For our purposes here,\n\n12   we've got the charge of the Court.         And let's go into\n\n13   formal charge conference.        I am going to submit it as\n\n14   set out on the proposed charge.\n\n15                    Who is going to assert any objections on\n\n16   behalf of the plaintiff?\n\n17             OBJECTIONS TO JURY CHARGE BY MS. RATLIFF\n18                    MS. RATLIFF:     Your Honor -- are we on the\n\n19   record?\n\n20                    THE COURT:     Yes.\n\n21                    MS. RATLIFF:     Plaintiffs -- and this is\n\n22   only for purposes of preserving what we raised in our\n\n23   partial instructed verdict.\n\n24                    We would submit an objection to Question 2\n\n25   only that it doesn't need to be in the charge because\n\f               Objections to Jury Charge by Ms. Ratliff           94\n                             May 22, 2013\n\n\n\n 1   there is no evidence for the jury to address a damage\n\n 2   question when it has been uncontroverted as we set out\n\n 3   earlier in our motion for partial instructed verdict.\n\n 4                   We have no objection to the form.     It's\n\n 5   been submitted in Question No. 2.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:   Okay.   Objection overruled.\n\n 7             OBJECTIONS TO THE CHARGE BY MR. McFARLEN\n\n 8                   MR. McFARLEN:   Yes, Your Honor.\n\n 9   Defendants would object to the Court's charge on the\n\n10   following grounds.\n\n11                   Number one, that we would object to the\n\n12   failure to include the issue on testamentary capacity.\n\n13                   We will -- defendants object to the\n\n14   wording of the definition of \"tortuous interference,\"\n\n15   one, because it includes -- well, it includes duress.\n\n16                   And actually because it includes undue\n\n17   influence, which has not been held to be an independent\n\n18   tort for which compensatory damages are awarded as\n\n19   opposed to supporting the initiation of a will.\n\n20                   We also object to it for including \"breach\n\n21   of fiduciary duty.\"\n\n22                   And, further, defendants object to the --\n\n23   including a definition of \"undue influence\" for the same\n\n24   reason.\n\n25                   I'm going to object also to the inclusion\n\f              Objections to the Charge by Mr. McFarlen             95\n                            May 22, 2013\n\n\n\n 1   of the definition of \"duress\" for the reason that there\n\n 2   is absolutely no evidence of coercion, mental, physical\n\n 3   or otherwise, no evidence of duress to support the\n\n 4   inclusion of that element.\n\n 5                    And we would further object to inclusion\n\n 6   of a definition of \"breach of fiduciary duty\" because\n\n 7   the breaches for which there is alleged evidence are the\n\n 8   same as for undue influence.           So it constitutes a second\n\n 9   bite at the apple.\n\n10                    Those are all our objections, Your Honor.\n\n11                    THE COURT:     Okay.     The objections will be\n\n12   overruled.     Okay.\n\n13                    Counsel, you've got the questions that I'm\n\n14   submitting to the jury.       And let's just try to save a\n\n15   tree or at least a branch, so I am not making any\n\n16   changes other than taking the word \"draft\" out and the\n\n17   typo.

Archer, David R.\n                          Archer, Carol Archer Bugg, John V. Archer, Karen Archer\n                          Ball, and Sherri Archer sued Ted M. Anderson and others\n                          for their actions that caused Appellees’ uncle, John R.\n                          “Jack” Archer, to sign numerous estate planning\n                          documents that disinherited the Archers. Jack signed all\n                          of the disinheriting estate planning documents after a\n                          stroke that rendered him mentally incapacitated. Ted died\n                          during the litigation, and the co-executors of his estate\n                          substituted as defendants.\n\nTrial court disposition: After a week and a half trial, the jury returned a verdict\n                         finding that Ted had tortiously interfered with the Archers’\n                         inheritance and awarded $2,006,150 in damages. CR646-\n                         53; App. A. The district court implicitly granted\n                         Appellants’ motion for partial JNOV and awarded the\n                         Archers an additional $588,054 in undisputed damages in\n                         the Final Judgment. CR1470-71; App. B.

Archer, David R. Archer, Carol\n\nArcher Bugg, John V. Archer, Karen Archer Ball, and Sherri Archer (“the Archers”)\n\nfile their Appellees/Cross-Appellants’ Brief requesting that the Court affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s Final Judgment on liability. By cross-issue, the Archers request that\n\nthe Court modify and render judgment awarding them their the total damages proved\n\nas a matter of law. Alternatively, the Archers seek affirmance of the Final Judgment\n\non liability and damages\n\n                                 INTRODUCTION\n\n      In this tortious interference with inheritance rights case, the Archers seek to\n\nrecover the attorney’s fees and other monies they were forced to pay in litigation\n\ninvolving their uncle, Jack Archer. Jack’s life-long estate plan left the bulk of his\n\nmore than $7.5 million estate to his nearest relatives, the Archers. Ted Anderson,\n\nhowever, had other plans for Jack’s estate. Shortly after Jack suffered a catastrophic\n\nstroke that rendered Jack mentally incapacitated, Ted Anderson obtained a power of\n\nattorney from Jack and assembled and instructed a team of attorneys to rewrite and\n\ncause Jack to sign three new wills, two trusts, and numerous property assignments.\n\nThe new estate planning documents not only disinherited the Archers and left Jack’s\n\nentire estate to charities, but also made a will contest virtually impossible.\n\f      Ted and his cohorts forced the Archers into costly and protracted legal\n\nwranglings in a guardianship proceeding and related lawsuits that lasted more than\n\n5 years and cost the Archers more than $3.4 million to reverse.\n\n      In the end, the Archers successfully reinstated Jack’s original estate plan and\n\ninherited Jack’s estate. Having successfully restored their inheritance from their\n\nuncle, the Archers brought the underlying tortious interference with inheritance\n\nlawsuit to recover the more than $3.4 million in attorney’s fees and other monies\n\npaid in the guardianship litigation as damages.\n\n      After an eight-day trial, the jury found that Ted tortiously interfered with the\n\nArchers’ inheritance and awarded $2,006,100 in damages. In post-verdict motions,\n\nAppellants conceded that the Archers proved more damages than the jury awarded.\n\nAs a result, the district court’s Final Judgment awarded $588,054, as conceded by\n\nAppellants, in addition to the jury’s verdict. The district court, however, did not\n\ngrant the Archers’ post-verdict motion seeking all of the damages they proved as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n      The Archers seek an affirmance of the Final Judgment on liability and by\n\ncross-issue seek a modification and rendition of judgment on the total amount of\n\ndamages that were proved as a matter of law. Alternatively, the Archers seek\n\naffirmance of the Final Judgment on liability and damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f                                    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n          The Archer Family. John R. “Jack” Archer lived in Corpus Christi, but spent\n\nconsiderable amounts of time on his 1000-acre ranch in Blanco County. 3RR84-85.\n\nJack was very successful in the oil and gas business and amassed an estate worth\n\nmore than $7.5 million. 3RR78, 88; 11RRPlx28, Plx29; 12RRPlx241.1 In addition\n\nto his home in Corpus and his ranch, Jack owned a house in Ireland, an airplane, a\n\nlarge coin collection, a collection of valuable jewels, and bank accounts located all\n\nover the world. 3RR85-86, 172-73.\n\n          Jack was married four times, but was single when he died. 3RR78-79. He\n\nhad no children. 3RR78-79. Jack’s nearest relatives were his only brother, Richard\n\nT. Archer, and Richard’s six children: Michael, John, David, Carol, Sherri, and\n\nKaren. 2\n\n          The Archer family was close-knit. For more than twenty years before Jack’s\n\nstroke, Jack and Richard’s family spent the majority of holidays together either at\n\nJack’s ranch, at his home in Corpus, or at Richard’s home in Tyler. 3RR77-78, 83-\n\n84; 4RR70. Jack remained close to the Archer children’s mother, Joanne, even after\n\nshe and Richard divorced. 3RR84; 4RR70.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 241 is not in numerical order in the Reporter’s Record. App. C. It is found before\nPlx222.\n2\n    Richard died while this lawsuit was pending.\n                                                   3\n\f          The Archer children were also very close to their Uncle Jack. 3RR83-84. Jack\n\nconsidered the Archer children as “part his children.” 4RR71. Similarly, the Archer\n\nchildren saw their Uncle Jack as a second father. 3RR88. Each Archer child had\n\nparticular activities they enjoyed doing with Uncle Jack. 3RR83-84. The Archer\n\nchildren always knew that Jack wanted the ranch to stay in the family. 3RR103.\n\nAppellant Ted Anderson admitted that Jack “really liked his nieces and nephews.”\n\n7RR60.\n\n          Jack and Richard established a trust for the Archer children, known as the\n\n“ADI Trust.” 3RR89-90, 94-95; 11RRPlx3. Richard was the trustee of the ADI\n\nTrust and the Archer children were the beneficiaries. 3RR89, 95. The Archer\n\nchildren did not receive regular distributions from the trust. 3RR89. Instead, the\n\ntrust was used for significant expenses such as college tuition or down payments on\n\nhouses when the Archer children became adults. 3RR89-90.3\n\n          Jack’s life-long estate plan: Jack’s fondness for his brother and his nieces\n\nand nephews was reflected in his estate planning. In his 1991 Last Will and\n\nTestament, Jack left the bulk of his estate, including his ranch, to Richard and\n\nRichard’s six children, five of whom are Appellees/Cross-Appellants in this case.4\n\n\n\n3\n    Attached as Appendix D is a timeline of Events. 12RRPlx233. App. D.\n4\n    Michael Archer is not a party to this case. 3RR74-75.\n\n\n\n                                                      4\n\f3RR99-100, 101; 11RRPlx9 at 2-3 (“1991 Will”). Jack’s 1991 Will also designated\n\ntwelve charities to split sixty percent of his mineral interests.      3RR100-01;\n\n11RRPlx9 at 9. The 1991 Will named Richard as executor. 11RRPlx9 at 4. Jack\n\nalso named Richard as primary beneficiary of his life insurance policies and bank\n\naccounts. 3RR92-93; 11RRPlx2, Plx4-6, Plx8.\n\n      Jack’s stroke. On August 25, 1998, at the age of 71, Jack suffered a\n\ndebilitating, large right hemisphere stroke, leaving him physically impaired and\n\nmentally incapacitated.   4RR148; 11RRPlx39 at PLF089274, Plx88.           Medical\n\nexperts described the stroke as “very severe,” “very significant,” and one that left\n\nJack “very impaired.” 4RR148, 159, 227. After his stroke, Jack remained in the\n\nhospital for three weeks and then went to a rehab hospital before returning to his\n\nhome. 3RR108; 11RRPlx39.\n\n      Following Jack’s stroke, Richard and the Archer children went to Corpus\n\nChristi to assist with Jack’s care. 3RR105-06. Richard went to Corpus Christi to\n\ncare for Jack seventeen times from the date of his stroke until the early summer of\n\n1999. 7RR85; 11RRPlx10. Richard had Jack’s house modified, obtained a van to\n\ntransport him, and found caregivers for Jack.        3RR106, 110, 111; 7RR85;\n\n11RRPlx11. The Archer children also went to Corpus Christi to help in the months\n\nafter Jack’s stroke. 3RR106, 110.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      Ted Anderson initiates process to disinherit the Archers. Within weeks\n\nafter Jack’s stroke, Ted Anderson began a series of actions that caused Jack to sign\n\nnew estate planning documents that disinherited the Archers.\n\n      First, on September 24, 1998, while Jack was still in the rehab hospital after\n\nhis stroke, Ted, who was an attorney, drafted and caused Jack to sign two powers of\n\nattorney. 6RR103; 7RR52, 64; 11RRPlx139, Plx140, Plx148. The durable power\n\nof attorney designated Ted as Jack’s attorney-in-fact with very broad powers.\n\n11RRPlx139. The medical power of attorney gave Ted the power to make medical\n\ndecisions for Jack. 6RR109, 111; 11RRPlx140.\n\n      Ted later claimed to never have needed the durable power of attorney.\n\nAccording to Ted, “I really haven’t had to use it. Jack signed everything we needed\n\nsigned.” 7RR55; 11RRPlx112 at 25. Ted, however, regularly used the medical\n\npower of attorney to communicate with Jack’s doctors. 11RRPlx53, Plx54, Plx67.\n\n      On the day Jack signed the powers of attorney, Jack had reported to the health\n\ncare providers that he had been working at this ranch in Blanco all day and that he\n\nhad not spent the night in the hospital. 6RR104; 11RRPlx43 at PLF083957. Neither\n\nof Jack’s statements was true. Medical evidence also showed that, soon after he\n\nsigned the powers of attorney, Jack expressed confusion about the documents he had\n\nsigned. 4RR201-202; 11RRPlx43 at PLF083938.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f      One of the Archers’ medical experts opined, that based on the severity of his\n\nstroke as reflected in the medical records dated September 24, 1998, Jack did not\n\nhave capacity. 4RR200. Further, Appellee Carol Archer Bugg visited her uncle\n\nwhile he was in the rehab hospital and observed that Jack was not in any condition\n\nto make decisions on his own. 3RR110.\n\n      In December 1998, Ted obtained the original of Jack’s 1991 Will from the\n\nattorney who drafted it. 6RR111-12; 11RRPlx141. Ted then made his first attempt\n\nto disinherit the Archers. In early 1999, Ted tried to get Jack to place 600 acres of\n\nhis ranch in a charitable remainder trust. 6RR122-24; 11RRPlx145. Putting Jack’s\n\nranch into a charitable remainder trust would have disinherited the Archers.\n\n6RR132. Jack, however, managed to communicate to Ted that he did not want to\n\nsell the ranch. 11RRPlx145.\n\n      Ted also began alienating the Archer family from Jack. By early 1999, the\n\nArchers’ access to Jack was being limited. 3RR127. In February 1999, Jack\n\npurportedly typed and signed a letter to Richard asking Richard not to visit him.\n\n11RRPlx51. Jack, however, never told Richard not to visit. 7RR82-83. Expert\n\ntestimony indicated the signature on the letter was not Jack’s and, moreover that,\n\nafter his stroke, Jack could not have been able to type. 4RR203-04; 11RRPlx44.\n\nThe Archers’ phone calls to Jack were not returned. 3RR129. They received no\n\ninformation on his medical condition during the spring of 1999. Id. The Archers\n\n\n                                         7\n\falso discovered that the caregivers Richard hired had been fired. 7RR85. By the\n\nend of the summer of 1999, the Archer family did not know where Jack was living.\n\n3RR136. The Archers even hired a private investigator to locate Jack, but to no avail.\n\n3RR137.\n\n      Meanwhile, Ted continued his scheming. Ted hired two estate planning\n\nattorneys, Buster Adami and Richard Leshin, to assist him in changing Jack’s estate\n\nplan. 6RR110-11, 127; 11RRPlx142, Plx143, Plx146.              In June 1999, Adami\n\nprepared a codicil to Jack’s 1991 Will that added J.R. Hamilton and T. Mark\n\nAnderson along with Richard as co-executors of Jack’s estate. 11RRPlx147. The\n\ncodicil required the three co-executors to act jointly or by majority. Id. In July 1999,\n\nanticipating that the Archers might file a guardianship proceeding, Adami wrote the\n\nNueces County judges informing them that Jack was managing his affairs through\n\nTed and encouraging them to not grant an ex parte guardianship. 11RRPlx150. As\n\ndetailed below, at Ted’s direction, Leshin prepared the post-stroke wills and trusts\n\nthat disinherited the Archers. 6RR120.\n\n      Ted’s efforts to disinherit the Archers by having Jack sell his ranch to charities\n\ncontinued. This time, however, Ted enlisted his recently hired estate planning\n\nattorneys, Leshin and Adami, to pressure Jack to sell. 6RR128-32; 11RRPlx151;\n\nApp. E. In July 1999, Ted wrote Adami about getting Jack to put his ranch in a\n\nfoundation for the benefit of the charities. 11RRPlx151. Ted wrote, “[h]e [Jack]\n\n\n                                           8\n\fmay switch and turn but I hope that we can continue to encourage him in this\n\ndirection and since Richard [Leshin] helped me with the limited partnership for the\n\nranch Jack might feel comfortable with suggestions from Richard [Leshin].”\n\n11RRPlx 151. Ted’s letter goes on to speculate about the size of Jack’s estate being\n\nat $3 million.\n\n      Ted surrendered his law license in June 1999. 11RRPlx148. He resigned as\n\nJack’s attorney-in-fact in November 1999. 11RRPlx153. Neither event, however,\n\nlimited Ted’s actions.\n\n        The Archers seek legal advice: Concerned for Jack’s well-being when they\n\ncould not locate Jack or find out his condition, the Archers sought legal advice.\n\n3RR132-33. In October 1999, the law firm of Ikard & Golden filed an application\n\nfor temporary guardian in Blanco County and got Richard appointed as temporary\n\nguardian of Jack’s person and estate. 3RR140; 11RRPlx14-16. Richard made it\n\nclear, however, that he did not want serve as permanent guardian of Jack’s estate;\n\nrather, he wanted a third party as permanent guardian. 7RR86-87; 11RRPlx20.\n\n      On December 29, 1999, a hearing was held on the Archers’ temporary\n\nguardianship application in Blanco County. 11RRPlx155. Attorneys from four law\n\nfirms, including Adami and Leshin, along with a court-appointed attorney ad litem,\n\nrepresented Jack at the hearing. 11RRPlx155 at 3. In response to the Archers’\n\nrequest for Jack to testify regarding his wishes, all five of Jack’s attorneys agreed on\n\n\n                                           9\n\fthe record that Jack needed a guardian of his person and his estate. 6RR139-40;\n\n11RRPlx155 at 15-23.\n\n      The agreement for a temporary guardianship meant that all of Jack’s attorneys\n\nagreed that Jack lacked the mental and physical capabilities to care for himself and\n\nto manage his own affairs. 6RR140-42; 11RRPlx160. Seemingly, the matter was\n\nresolved.\n\n      Ted continued his plan to disinherit the Archers. Despite the agreement\n\nfor a temporary guardian, and despite his resignation as Jack’s attorney-in-fact under\n\nthe power of attorney, Ted continued to seek to change Jack’s estate plan. 6RR135.\n\n      In early January 2000, Ted sought Leshin’s advice on Jack’s estate planning,\n\nand in particular, on how to avoid a future guardianship. 11RRPlx154, Plx157.\n\nLeshin advised that any estate planning would have to wait until Jack was no longer\n\nsubject of a guardianship proceeding. 6RR143; 11RRPlx157. Leshin also advised\n\nTed on a scheme that “will make a contest of the disposition of [Jack’s] assets more\n\ndifficult.” 11RRPlx157. According to Leshin, if the temporary guardianship over\n\nJack were dismissed, Jack’s assets could be transferred to a revocable trust to avoid\n\na future guardianship and court supervision. 6RR136-37; 11RRPlx154. Jack was\n\nnot copied on any of Leshin’s estate planning letters. 11RRPlx154, Plx157.\n\n      To effectuate the estate plan Leshin concocted, on March 16, 2000, Ted fired\n\nall of the attorneys who represented Jack in the Blanco County guardianship who\n\n\n                                         10\n\fhad agreed Jack needed a guardian. 6RR149-50; 11RRPlx162. Ted hired a trial\n\nattorney, Doug Hearne, Sr., who repudiated the agreement that Jack needed a\n\ntemporary guardianship. 6RR159; 12RRPlx216, Plx217.\n\n      March 2000 Will. On the same day he fired Jack’s attorneys, Ted sent Jack’s\n\n1991 Will to Leshin. 6RR74; 11RRPlx163. On March 19, 2000, Jack signed the\n\nMarch 2000 Will that Leshin drafted that left all of Jack’s assets to charities, entirely\n\ndisinheriting the Archers.       6RR151; 11RRPlx166.          The March 2000 Will\n\ncontemplated that a trust would be established to hold Jack’s assets, but that, if the\n\ntrust were not set up before Jack died, all of his assets would go to the charities.\n\n11RRPlx166 at 1. Jack did not read the will before signing it; Leshin read it to him\n\nat the will signing. 7RR30.\n\n      April 2000 Will. Soon after Jack signed the March 2000 Will, Ted directed\n\nLeshin to prepare another will and a trust. 7RR32-33; 11RRPlx170. On April 26,\n\n2000, Jack signed the April 2000 Will, the Jack Archer Trust Indenture (“Trust”),\n\nand several property assignments that transferred all of Jack’s assets into the Trust.\n\n6RR153-54; 11RRPlx171-76. The Trust was to terminate on Jack’s death and its\n\nassets to be distributed among that the twelve named charities. 11RRPlx171 at 2-3.\n\nTed, who was no longer licensed to practice law, explained the Trust and had Jack\n\nsign the Trust before Leshin arrived at the will signing. 11RRPlx177. According to\n\nLeshin, one of the purposes of the April 2000 Will was to make a will contest even\n\n\n                                           11\n\fmore difficult for the Archers, by increasing the number of wills to challenge.\n\n7RR39; 11RRPlx177.\n\n      For the March 2000 Will, the April 2000 Will, and the Trust, Leshin received\n\nall of his instruction for the document’s terms from Ted. 7RR27-28, 32, 36-38, 41-\n\n42; 11RRPlx165, Plx167. Leshin never talked to Jack about the documents until the\n\nsignings. Id. Ted decided when Jack would sign documents and was present for\n\nevery signing. 6RR95-96, 156; 7RR43; 11RRPlx167.\n\n      Although he represented Jack for three years, Leshin never had a phone\n\nconversation with Jack or had any written correspondence with him. 7RR26-27.\n\nLeshin’s file and billing records confirmed that his only communications on Jack’s\n\nmatter were with Ted. 6RR113-14, 118-20, 135; 11RRPlx142, Plx144, Plx149,\n\nPlx152, Plx158, Plx161, Plx169, Plx182, Plx184-87, Plx191, Plx195, Plx196. On\n\nthe occasions when Leshin met with Jack, Ted was always present. 7RR26.\n\n      Although Ted was Leshin’s source of information on Jack, Leshin did not\n\nknow that Jack had had a stroke. 7RR20. Leshin made no assessment of Jack’s\n\ncapacity when Jack signed the estate planning documents.         6RR158; 7RR37.\n\nInstead, Leshin relied solely on Ted’s representations regarding Jack’s capacity.\n\n7RR21, 37.\n\n      Contrary to Leshin’s testimony that Ted orchestrated all of Jack’s post-stroke\n\nwills, and that the records showed that Ted’s name was “all over everything,” Ted\n\n\n                                        12\n\fcontended that he had nothing to do with the wills. 6RR71-73, 61; 7RR63. When\n\npressed in his deposition about his involvement, Ted refused to answer the questions.\n\n7RR67-68.\n\n      In May 2000, Jack signed a new durable power of attorney and medical power\n\nof attorney naming Ted as attorney-in-fact and specifically disqualified the Archer\n\nfamily from serving. 6RR159-60; 11RRPlx179, Plx180.\n\n      Jack’s medical condition around the 2000 will signings. Jack signed the\n\nMarch 2000 Will on March 19, 2000, and the April 2000 Will and Trust on April\n\n26, 2000. 11RRPlx166, Plx171-76. Jack was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric\n\nhospital from March 28 through April 19, 2000. 7RR33; 11RRPlx71-74. The\n\npsychiatric hospital notes described Jack’s symptoms as “delusional paranoia” and\n\nbeing “oriented to person only.” 11RRPlx73 at PLF069710, Plx74 at PLF069715.\n\nWhile in the psychiatric hospital, Jack reported (incorrectly) that the year was 1928,\n\nthat he was in his thirties, that his parents were still living, and that he was in Ohio.\n\n11RRPlx71 at PLF038490. The psychiatric hospital notes are replete with entries\n\ndescribing Jack as confused, disoriented, and having delusional and suicidal\n\nthoughts. 11RRPlx71 at PLF038490, PLF038492, PLF038493, PLF038494. One of\n\nJack’s doctors, Dr. Still, opined that Jack was incapacitated in May 2000. 7RR88-\n\n89.\n\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\f      Jack was again admitted to a psychiatric hospital in June 2000. 11RRPlx81,\n\n82.

By repudiating the\n\nBlanco County temporary guardianship, Ted forced the Archers to file a new\n\nguardianship proceeding. 11RRPlx18. In May 2000, David Archer and Carol\n\nArcher Bugg filed the Bexar County guardianship proceeding, seeking an\n\nindependent person as guardian of Jack’s estate and person.             3RR144-46;\n\n11RRPlx18. Jack’s attorneys contested the guardianship, contending Jack was\n\ncompetent and did not need a guardianship. 3RR147.\n\n      While the Bexar County guardianship was pending, the Archers discovered\n\nfor the first time, that they had been disinherited and that the several people had\n\ntaken money from Jack since his stroke. 6RR23; 11RRPlx21, 12RRPlx218. In\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fparticular, the Archers learned that the attorneys Ted hired were being paid from\n\nJack’s assets without court approval. 7RR106; 11RRPlx21.\n\n      Medical evidence detailed impact of Jack’s stroke. During the guardianship\n\nproceeding, the Archers also learned about the extent of Jack’s medical condition.\n\n      In addition to the psychiatric hospital records, Jack’s medical records\n\nchronicled the severe impact that his August 1998 stroke had on his mental capacity.\n\nOne of Jack’s treating physicians, Dr. Faulk, wrote in November 1999 that Jack was\n\n“obviously unable to control his estate in his current condition, and will require\n\nassistance in having his wishes carried through.” 11RRPlx68. A court-appointed\n\ndoctor, Dr. Lichtenstein, who examined Jack in September 2000, reported that Jack’s\n\nstroke rendered him mentally and physically incapacitated and in need of a guardian.\n\n11RRPlx88. Dr. Lichtenstein examined Jack again in June 2001 and reaffirmed his\n\nearlier opinion. 11RRPlx104. Dr. Still testified that in May 2001 Jack was not able\n\nto speak. 7RR91. Dr. Faulk, opined in June 2001 that Jack was “incapacitated to\n\nhandle any of his affairs” “by any standard medical or legal.” 11RRPlx105. Jack’s\n\nin-chambers interview with the Bexar County probate judge in January 2001 and his\n\nJuly 2001 deposition further demonstrated Jack’s severely diminished capacity.\n\n4RR220-21; 11RRPlx27, 11RRPlx93 at 61-86.\n\n      The Archers’ medical expert witnesses, Dr. Richard Coons and Dr. William\n\nDailey, both opined that Jack was incapacitated and in need of a guardian from the\n\n\n                                        15\n\fdate of his stroke in August 1998 onward.          4RR200, 248-49; 5RR109-10;\n\n11RRPlx105. Dr. Dailey testified that Jack’s lack of mental capacity would have\n\nbeen obvious to lay people who came in contact with Jack. 4RR276.\n\n      Probate court appoints temporary guardians. The probate court appointed\n\nPam Rucker, Jack’s former girlfriend, as temporary guardian of his person.\n\n11RRPlx189. As temporary guardian, Pam refused to allow the Archers to visit Jack\n\nand forced the family to seek court-ordered visitation to see their uncle. 3RR151;\n\n7RR120-21.\n\n      The probate court appointed J.R. Hamilton as temporary guardian of Jack’s\n\nestate. 11RRPlx190. Hamilton’s April 2001 accounting listed Jack as having no\n\nassets, and that all of his assets were held in trust. 12RRPlx218. The accounting\n\ngave the Archers their first indication that they had been disinherited. 3RR149;\n\n12RRPlx218.\n\n      May 2001 Will. While the Bexar County guardianship proceeding was\n\npending, Ted had Jack sign another will and an amendment to the Trust.\n\n11RRPlx192, Plx194. The May 2001 Will and the trust amendment removed\n\nHamilton as executor and successor trustee, and replaced him with Ted’s son, T.\n\nMark Anderson.       6RR160-61; 11RRPlx192, Plx194.          Jack signed another\n\nguardianship directive that disqualified the Archer family from serving as guardian.\n\n11RRPlx193.\n\n\n                                        16\n\f      Archers change their attorney’s fees agreement. After learning that they had\n\nbeen disinherited, the Archers changed their attorney’s fee arrangement with their\n\nlaw firm from hourly to a contingent fee in November 2001.                  6RR22. The\n\ncontingency fee was based on getting the Archers reinstated as beneficiaries. It\n\nreinstated, the law firm would receive a percentage of the value of Jack’s estate,\n\nincluding monies brought into Jack’s guardianship estate through lawsuits against\n\nTed and the attorneys he had hired. 6RR23-26; 11RRPlx22 at 2-3.\n\n      Lawsuits filed in the Bexar County guardianship. The Archers filed\n\nseveral lawsuits within the guardianship to challenge the validity of the Trust and to\n\ntry to recover the hundreds of thousands of dollars that had been taken from Jack\n\nsince his stroke. 3RR154-55; 4RR38-39.\n\n      Lawsuit over the validity of the Trust and settlement with the charities. The\n\nexistence of competing wills – one leaving Jack’s estate to the Archers and three\n\nwills and a trust leaving Jack’s entire estate to the charities – set the stage for a will\n\ncontest. 6RR64-65, 68-69. Rather than pursue a costly, contentious will contest, the\n\nArchers filed a declaratory judgment action to determine the validity of the Trusts\n\nwhile Jack was still alive. 3RR157-58; 6RR70-71; 11RRPlx23.                  Contrary to\n\nAppellants’ assertion, the Archers did not “sue the Christian Charities.” Appts. Br.\n\nat 14. As named beneficiaries in the Trust, the charities were necessary parties to the\n\ndeclaratory judgment action. 6RR62-63.\n\n\n                                           17\n\f      Lawsuits against parties who had wrongfully taken money from Jack: The\n\nArchers filed three lawsuits against individuals who had taken advantage of Jack\n\nafter his stroke. These lawsuits were filed in November 2001 by Appellee Sherri\n\nArcher Loveday, derivatively on Jack and his guardianship estate’s behalf, against\n\nthe following defendants 3RR154-55; 4RR38-39; 7RR121-22:\n\n      1)     Hearne Sr., Leshin, Adami, and Anderson for legal malpractice\n             12RRDx12;\n\n      2)     Ted Anderson and Pam Rucker for breach of fiduciary duty and for\n             intentional infliction of emotional distress 12RRDx13; and\n\n      3)     J.R. Hamilton, as temporary guardian of Jack’s estate, and the bond\n             company for breach of duty by failing to obtain court approval of\n             expenses and for paying expenses from Jack’s trust 7RR117-18, 123;\n             12RRDx14.\n\n      Lawsuit for tortious interference with inheritance. The Archers also filed a\n\nlawsuit for tortious interference with inheritance against Ted, Hearne Sr., and Leshin\n\nin February 2003. CR98-117. The probate court abated the lawsuit until after Jack\n\ndied because generally, a tortious interference with inheritance claim does not ripen\n\nuntil death. 6RR15-17.\n\n      Contrary to Appellants’ characterization, the Archers were very successful in\n\nthe Bexar County guardianship and related litigation. Appts. Br. at 10. First, as a\n\nresult of the lawsuit against Pam Rucker, she resigned as guardian, and the probate\n\ncourt appointed Appellee Carol Archer Bugg as Jack’s permanent guardian of the\n\nperson.; 3RR164-6; 7RR123-24; 11RRPlx25. The Archers also got J.R. Hamilton\n                                         18\n\fremoved as temporary guardian of Jack’s estate. 7RR117-18, 120. The probate\n\ncourt granted the Archers’ request for an independent guardian of the estate and\n\nappointed Robert McIntyre as guardian of Jack’s estate. 3RR166; 7RR102-03;\n\n12RRPlx240.\n\n       Second, by challenging the validity of the post-stroke Trust and settling with\n\nthe charities, the Archers nullified the estate-planning documents that Ted, and\n\nothers working with Ted, had Jack sign that disinherited the family. 7RR102-03.\n\nThe Archers and the charities reached a settlement before Jack died and thus,\n\navoided a will contest. 4RR35-36; 11RRPlx23. The charities agreed to not file\n\nJack’s post-stroke wills for probate, leaving Jack’s 1991 Will in place. 11RRPlx23\n\nat 9-13. The Archers had to give much more to the charities than Jack’s 1991 will\n\nleft to the charities. The Archers paid the twelve designated charities $588,054 over\n\nand above what Jack’s 1991 Will left them. 3RR159-61; 11RRPlx24, Plx30,\n\n12RRPlx2415.\n\n       Finally, the lawsuits filed against Hearne Sr., Adami, and Hamilton resulted\n\nin hundreds of thousands of dollars being returned to Jack’s guardianship estate in\n\nsettlements with. 6RR60-62; 12RRPlx241.\n\n\n\n\n5\n Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 241 is not in numerical order in the Reporter’s Record.

As a result of the Archers’ efforts, Jack returned\n\nto living on his ranch, near his brother Richard. 7RR102-03. Carol remained his\n\nguardian for the rest of his life. 3RR166-68. Jack was never put in a psychiatric\n\nhospital after Carol became his guardian. 3RR168. After the Archers moved Jack\n\nback to his ranch, Jack never heard from Ted. 3RR169.\n\n      Jack died on April 17, 2006. 3RR170; 11RRPlx28. Jack’s 1991 Will was\n\nprobated and the Archers received the inheritance Jack intended for them to have.\n\n3RR174; 11RRPlx27, Plx36. Regaining their inheritance, however, came at a\n\nsignificant monetary cost.\n\n      The Travis County case. In the underlying lawsuit here, the Archers sought\n\nthe difference between what they actually received from Jack’s estate and what they\n\nwould have received had Ted not tortiously interfered. CR654-710. The Archers\n\nsought as damages the amount paid to get themselves reinstated as beneficiaries: 1)\n\ntheir attorney’s fees paid in the Bexar County litigation of $2,865,928 and 2) the\n\namount paid to settle with the charities of $588,054, for a total of $3,453,982.\n\n6RR79; 7RR102-03; 12RRPlx241. App. C.\n\n      The Archers originally brought the tortious interference lawsuit in the Bexar\n\nCounty guardianship.     Once Jack died, the Bexar County probate court lost\n\njurisdiction over the tortious interference lawsuit and dismissed it. 6RR15-16. The\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f   Archers then refiled in Travis County based on defendant Doug Hearne Sr.’s\n\n   residence in Travis County. 6RR15-17; CR5-25.\n\n         Ted died on March 28, 2006, while this lawsuit was pending.

After settlements with Leshin and Hearne Sr.’s estate, the\n\n   Archers proceeded to trial on May 13, 2013 against T. Mark Anderson and Christine\n\n   Anderson, as co-executors of Ted’s estate. On May 23, the jury returned its verdict\n\n   and found that Ted tortiously interfered with the Archers’ inheritance. Appellants\n\n   do not dispute this finding on appeal.

Appellants have waived in\n\nthe district court or in their brief on appeal at least some part of their argument under\n\neach issue.\n\n       The jury found that Ted tortiously interfered with the Archers’ inheritance.\n\nThat fact finding is not challenged on appeal. Instead, Appellants contend that Ted’s\n\ntortious conduct is not actionable. Contrary to Appellants’ argument, Texas law has\n\nlong recognized a cause of action for tortious interference with inheritance when a\n\nperson by fraud, duress, or other tortious means prevents another person from\n\nreceiving an inheritance from a third party that she would otherwise have received.\n\n       The district court correctly awarded the Archers their attorney’s fees incurred\n\nin prior litigation as a result of Ted’s tortious conduct as damages. As Texas\n\nSupreme Court precedent holds, attorney’s fees and litigation expenses incurred in\n\nprior litigation with a third party are recoverable as actual damages.\n\n       In addition to their attorney’s fees, the district court properly awarded an\n\nadditional $588,054 to jury’s verdict of $2,006,150. Appellants conceded in their\n\npost-verdict motions that the Archers established the $588,054 as the amount paid\n\nto settle with the charities.\n\n       Finally, the district court properly calculated prejudgment interest. Well-\n\nestablished law prohibits tolling of prejudgment interest as argued by Appellants.\n\n\n                                           23\n\f        By cross issue, the Archers seek the entire amount of their attorney’s fees paid\n\nin the prior litigation that were proved as a matter of law. Appellants offered no\n\nevidence or expert witness to controvert the Archers’ attorney’s fees evidence.\n\n        For these reasons and those set out below, the district court correctly signed a\n\nfinal judgment on liability. The Archers request modification and rendition of\n\njudgment on their full damages proved as a matter of law. Alternatively, the Archers\n\nrequest the Court affirm the Final Judgment on liability and damages.\n\n                            ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nI.      The Archers followed well-established Texas law when they sued Ted\n        Anderson for tortious interference with their inheritance. [Responsive to\n        Issue 1]\n\n        Appellants do not challenge, and thus concede, that Ted tortiously interfered\n\nwith the Archers’ inheritance. Appellants urge this Court to conclude, however, that\n\nthere is no cause of action for tortious interference with inheritance. Appellants’\n\nbriefing error waives this Court’s review. Even considering Appellants’ waived\n\nargument, Texas law has long recognize tortious interference with inheritance as a\n\ncause of action.6\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Appellants only filed a general denial. CR62-65. Appellants raised the affirmative defense of whether\ntortious interference with inheritance is a recognized cause of action for the first time in their amended\nmotion for partial JNOV filed July 25, 2013, more than two months after the verdict. CR1264-1275. App.\nJ.\n\n\n                                                   24\n\f      A.     Appellants’ briefing error waives Issue 1.\n\n      According to Appellants, 1) Texas law does not recognize a cause of action\n\nfor tortious interference with inheritance, and 2) if the tort exists, it does not apply\n\nto attorneys. Appellants have waived both arguments.\n\n      In support of their first argument, Appellants cite no authority for their\n\ncontention that tortious interference with inheritance does not exist. TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1(i). Their only authorities cited—King v. Acker and Meduna v. Holder—\n\ndemonstrate that the tort does exist. Appellants make no argument to distinguish\n\nthese and other controlling authority. Appts. Br. at 21. Marin Real Estate Partners,\n\nL.P. v.

App.—San Antonio 2011, no pet.). Thus, this\n\nargument is waived.\n\n      In their second argument that tortious interference with inheritance does not\n\napply to attorneys, Appellants rely on evidence from the appellate record, but do not\n\ncite to any place in the over 9,000-page record. (The Clerk’s Record is 2917 pages\n\nand the Reporter’s Record is 6311 pages).        Appts. Br. at 21-23. Accordingly,\n\nAppellants have waived Issue 1. See TEX. R. APP.

None of these facts is present here.\n\n      First, when the Archers sued Ted, he was no longer an attorney. He had\n\nresigned his license to practice law four years before the Archers brought their\n\ntortious interference lawsuit. 11RRPlx148. Second, Ted did not draft the wills or\n\ntrusts at issue. 6RR164-65. It was undisputed that Leshin prepared the post-stroke\n\nwills and trusts that Jack signed. 11RRPlx167, Plx177. Third, the Archers did not\n\nsue Ted for legal malpractice; they sued Ted for tortious interference with\n\ninheritance. CR98-117, 654-719. Finally, tortious interference with inheritance is\n\nnot based on the existence of a duty. See King v. Acker, 725 S.W.2d at 752-54 (duty\n\nis not an element of tortious interference with inheritance).\n\n      Accordingly, because tortious interference with inheritance is long-\n\nrecognized in Texas jurisprudence, this Court should overrule Issue 1.\n\nII.   The Archers are entitled to their attorney’s fees and litigation expenses\n      incurred in the Bexar County litigation as damages. [Responsive to Issues\n      2-4]\n\n      Appellants raise three arguments to the district court’s award of attorney’s\n\nfees and expenses paid by the Archers in prior litigation as damages: 1) attorney’s\n\nfees cannot be recovered as damages, (Appts. Br. at 23-27); 2) the Archers had a\n\nduty to segregate attorney’s fees and failed to meet their burden, (Appts. Br. at 27-\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f29); and 3) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to show the\n\nreasonableness and necessity of the Archers’ attorney’s fees, (Appts. Br. at 29-31).\n\n      As set out below, well-established Texas law refutes Appellants’ first\n\nargument. Appellants have waived their second and third arguments.\n\n      A.     Texas jurisprudence recognizes recovery of attorney’s fees\n             incurred in prior litigation as damages.\n\n      Because of Ted’s tortious conduct in having Jack change his estate plan and\n\ndisinherit the Archers, the Archers had to hire attorneys and pursue litigation to\n\nreinstate their uncle’s original estate plan set out in Jack’s 1991 Will. The Archers\n\nput on undisputed evidence that they incurred $2,865,928 in attorney’s fees and\n\nlitigation expenses in the Bexar County guardianship litigation to get themselves\n\nreinstated as Jack intended. 6RR42, 52-53; 12RRPlx241.

Appellants waived their argument about segregation of attorney’s\n             fees.\n\n      Assuming segregation is an issue in an attorney’s fees as damages case, which\n\nthe Archers dispute, Appellants waived any argument about the segregation of\n\nattorney’s fees.\n\n      Appellants objected to the Archers’ attorney’s fees evidence solely on the\n\nground that the Archers could not recover attorney’s fees as damages. 6RR13-17.\n\nAppellants made no objection to the evidence on the basis of segregation.

Appts. Br. at\n\n28-29. Appellants’ argument purports to refer to the record, but contains no record\n\ncitations. Instead, it states “(RR )” and “(CR )” with no page references. This is\n\nwaiver. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). This Court has no duty to review a voluminous\n\nrecord without guidance from an appellant to determine if an issue raised constitutes\n\nreversible error. Keyes Helium Co. v. Regency Gas Servs., L.P., 393 S.W.3d at 861.\n\nBullock v. American Heart Ass’n, 360 S.W.3d at 665 (appellate court has no duty or\n\nright to perform an independent review of the record and applicable law to determine\n\nwhether there was error). This is particularly true given that the record in this appeal\n\nis over 9,000 pages.\n\n      C.     Segregation of attorney’s fees does not apply in an attorney’s fees\n             as damages case.\n\n      Alternatively, even considering Appellants’ waived argument, segregation of\n\nattorney’s fees has no application here. Segregation is based on some attorney’s fees\n\nbeing recoverable (by contract or by statute) and some attorney’s fees being not\n\nrecoverable. Attorney’s fees as damages, on the other hand, are based on a plaintiff\n\nbeing involved in litigation with a third party because of defendant’s tortious conduct\n\nand incurring attorney’s fees. See Turner, 385 S.W.2d at 234. Further, the Archers\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\fdid not seek their attorney’s fees in this case. They only sought as damages their\n\nattorney’s fees incurred in the prior litigation.\n\n      When recovering attorney’s fees as damages from a prior lawsuit, the only\n\nissue is whether the attorney’s fees were reasonable and necessary.

In an attorney’s fees as damages case,\n\ncourts do not address whether the underlying lawsuit involved a claim for attorney’s\n\nfees under a contract or by statute. Rice v. Gregory, 780 S.W.2d at 389; Lesikar, 33\n\nS.W.3d at 306. None of Appellants’ cited authorities on segregation were attorney’s\n\nfees as damages cases. Appts. Br. at 27-28.\n\n      Appellants’ waived argument on segregation is refuted by the record. First,\n\nthe Archers’ witness on attorney’s fees testified that the Archers’ attorney’s fees\n\ncould not have been segregated because of the substantial overlap in the\n\nguardianship proceeding and related lawsuits. 6RR63-64. All of the legal work was\n\nintertwined. 6RR29; 12RRPlx211, Plx212. The Archers’ ability to settle with the\n\ncharities was based on the legal work performed in Jack’s contested guardianship\n\nproceeding, during which the Archers developed their proof that Jack lacked mental\n\ncapacity when he signed the post-stroke wills and trusts.\n\n\n                                           38\n\fThe core issue in all of the litigation was Jack’s mental capacity when the various\n\ndocuments were signed and Ted’s taking advantage of Jack’s lack of capacity.\n\n      Second, Appellants’ contention that some of the lawsuits the Archers pursued\n\nin the Bexar County guardianship did not involve Ted and thus supports segregation\n\nof fees, is also refuted by the record. As record reflects, Ted was the source for all\n\nof the litigation that the Archers were forced to pursue involving their uncle.\n\n      Ted’s tortious conduct in having Jack change his estate plan pitted the Archers\n\nagainst the charities in what would have been a will contest. 6RR64-65; 11RRPlx23.\n\nTed’s tortious conduct caused Jack to sign three post-stroke wills and two trusts that\n\ndisinherited the Archers in favor of the charities. 11RRPlx166, Plx171, Plx172,\n\nPlx192, Plx194. There would have been no dispute had Ted not gotten Jack to\n\nchange his 1991 Will.\n\n      Ted’s tortious conduct in having Jack sign the new wills and trusts also\n\nprecipitated the other lawsuits that the Archers filed derivatively on Jack and his\n\nestate’s behalf. The other litigation the Archer family pursed was a direct result of\n\nbeing disinherited. Ted hired and directed the attorneys (Leshin, Adami, and Hearne\n\nSr.) and Hamilton, all of whom were sued and paid settlements in the Bexar County\n\nlawsuits. 6RR71-72; 11RRPlx119, Plx122, Plx142, Plx143, Plx146, Plx151, Plx154,\n\nPlx155, Plx157, Plx165, Plx167, Plx170, Plx172, Plx179, Plx183; 12RRPlx227,\n\nPlx241. App. C.\n\n\n                                          39\n\f      Ted wired $400,000 from Jack’s bank account to Hearne Sr. to pay all of the\n\nattorney’s fees. 6RR74. These fees were eventually reimbursed to Jack’s estate as a\n\nresult of the Archers’ lawsuit. 6RR60-62. Ted instructed Leshin to put J.R. Hamilton\n\nin as trustee of Jack’s Trust. 6RR71-72. Hamilton also settled and paid money back\n\nto Jack. That is, without Ted wanting to change Jack’s estate plan, Leshin, Hearne,\n\nSr., Adami, or J.R. Hamilton would not have been involved.\n\n      As Appellee Carol Archer Bugg testified, but for Ted’s conduct, her family\n\nwould not have been in years of litigation and been forced to pay millions in\n\nattorney’s fees and settlement money simply to obtain what their Uncle Jack had\n\nalways intended. 3RR176-178.\n\n      Appellants offered no evidence on the issue of segregation.\n\n      Every lawsuit the Archers were forced to pursue in the Bexar County\n\nguardianship was directly tied to Ted, and without Ted’s tortious conduct, the\n\nArchers would not have been forced to pursue. Accordingly, there is no basis to\n\nsegregate attorney’s fees on the basis that Ted was not involved.\n\n      D.     Appellants waive their sufficiency of the evidence argument.\n\n      Appellants argue that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to\n\nshow the reasonableness and necessity of the Archers’ attorney’s fees.

After the Archers\n\npresented extensive testimony on the amount of attorney’s fees paid for the Bexar\n\nCounty litigation, (see infra II.F. at 51) Frank Ikard, one of the attorneys who\n\nrepresented the Archers throughout the Bexar County litigation, provided expert\n\ntestimony as to the reasonableness and necessity for the attorney’s fees. 7RR94-\n\n139.\n\n       Ikard testified that he had practiced law for more than 40 years and in the\n\nfiduciary litigation area for more than 20 years. 7RR108.          Ikard explained the\n\nnature of the problems and issues in the case from the outset, as well as the strategies\n\nand work pursued on the Archers’ behalf. 7RR96-97, 110-25.\n\n       Ikard went through the Texas Disciplinary Rules 1.04(b) to support the\n\nreasonableness and necessity of the attorney’s fees. 7RR110-25. Ikard explained\n\nthat the fee arrangement was originally hourly but then changed to a contingent fee.\n\n7RR106-07. Ikard’s firm represented the Archers for close to a decade. 7RR110.\n\n\n                                          42\n\f      Ikard testified about the number of hours spent on the case and the expenses\n\nincurred. 7RR110. Ikard explained the novelty and complexity of the issues,\n\nbeginning with the difficulty in trying to serve Jack in the original guardianship\n\nproceeding because he was being moved from location to location to avoid service.\n\n7RR110-11; 11RRPlx17. A further complicating and novel factor was that Jack had\n\nfive attorneys agreeing in court that he needed a guardian. 7RR112-13. While the\n\nattorneys tried to memorialize the agreement, Ted fired the attorneys and hired\n\nanother one to repudiate the agreement calling for a guardian. Id. This imposed\n\nadditional expense and difficulty and forced the Archers to refile the guardianship.\n\n7RR112, 114-15. According to Ikard, it was novel and unusual to have someone in\n\nJack’s position in an agreed guardianship and, when the guardianship agreement was\n\nrepudiated, to have Jack put all of his assets in trust with Jack as trustee. 7RR112-\n\n13.\n\n      Another complicating factor in the case was the court-appointed temporary\n\nguardian of the estate, J.R. Hamilton, who eventually was removed because he failed\n\nto file statutory reports on the ward’s estate. 7RR117-18. After Hamilton, there were\n\na series of temporary guardians. 7RR120. Another unusual matter was that the\n\ncourt-appointed temporary guardian of Jack’s person refused to allow the Archers\n\nto visit him. 7RR120-21. This forced the Archers to seek court-ordered visitation.\n\n7RR121. Another complicating factor was that Hearne Sr. obtained $400,000 from\n\n\n                                         43\n\fJack’s bank account through Ted and used the money to pay the attorneys\n\nrepresenting Jack, without court approval. 7RR121-22. Hearne Sr. was eventually\n\nordered to repay this money. Id.\n\n       Further, Ikard testified to the successes obtained by his firm’s representation\n\nof the Archers. 7RR110-25. Ikard testified to the amount involved and the results\n\nobtained. 7RR95. In particular, the Archers were reunited with their uncle, the post-\n\nstroke wills were set aside, Bugg became Jack’s guardian, and an independent third\n\nparty became the guardian of Jack’s estate. 7RR102-03. The Archers were also\n\nsuccessful in recovering monies that had been wrongfully taken from Jack. 7RR105,\n\n122-24.\n\n       Finally, Ikard testified that the attorney’s fees incurred and paid by the\n\nArchers were both reasonable and necessary. 7RR110-26; 125-26. Ikard also\n\ntestified that the forty-percent contingency fee was usual and customary in Travis\n\nCounty for the kind of legal worked performed on the Archers’ behalf. 7RR125-26.\n\n       Appellants made no attempt to attack Ikard’s credentials, credibility, or his\n\nopinions on the reasonableness of and necessity for the attorney’s fees the Archers\n\npaid. 7RR126-39.\n\n       Further, Ikard’s expert opinion was uncontroverted. Appellants offered no\n\nwitness or other evidence on the issue of the attorney’s fees that the Archers paid in\n\nthe prior litigation.\n\n\n                                          44\n\f      Accordingly, the evidence was both legally and factually sufficient to support\n\nthe reasonableness and necessity for the Archers’ attorney’s fees and litigation\n\nexpenses paid in the prior litigation. Thus, this Court can affirm the damage award\n\nin the Final Judgment. As set out below, the Archers seek additional damages. This\n\nCourt should overrule Issues 2, 3 and 4.\n\n      F.     The district court erred in denying the Archers’ motion for partial\n             JNOV on the full amount of attorney’s fees proved as a matter of\n             law. [Cross Issue 1]\n\n      By cross-issue, the Archers seek the full amount of their attorney’s fees paid\n\nin the prior litigation as damages that were proved as a matter of law, but which were\n\nnot awarded by the district court. The Archers seek the entire amount of attorney’s\n\nfees paid in the prior litigation of $2,865,928, along with the $588,054 awarded by\n\nthe district court in post-verdict motions. CR1461.

This amount consisted of the settlement with the charities\n\nof $588,054 and the $2,865,928 in attorney’s fees paid. The jury’s damage award\n\nreduced the Archers’ attorney’s fees damages by thirty percent and (as addressed in\n\nIII. C. below) entirely omitted the $588,054 paid to settle with the charities.

In\n\nSmith, the Trust sued the Smiths as guarantors on a lease when the lessee defaulted,\n\nand sought actual damages of $200,000 and $47,438.75 in attorney’s fees. 235\n\nS.W.3d at 828-29. The jury awarded $65,000 in damages and no attorney’s fees.\n\nId. at 822. The trial court rendered judgment on the damages amount and awarded\n\n$7,500 in attorney’s fees.\n\n      The Dallas Court of Appeals vacated the $7,500 attorney’s fees award and\n\nrendered judgment for the Trust’s $47,438.75 in attorney’s fees. Id. at 829. The\n\nDallas Court of Appeals rejected the Smiths’ argument that the jury was entitled to\n\ndisregard the uncontroverted evidence and award no attorney’s fees. In response to\n\nthe Trust’s uncontroverted evidence of its attorney’s fees, the Smiths failed to\n\npresent evidence that the attorney’s fees were not necessary or that the Trust’s\n\nattorney’s legal work had no value. Id. Accordingly, the court of appeals concluded\n\nthere was “no evidence to support the jury’s finding of no attorney’s fees.” Id. The\n\ncourt of appeals rendered judgment for $47,438.75 in attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\f       The court of appeals noted that the Smiths had ample opportunity to question\n\nor challenge the Trust’s attorney’s fees evidence. Id. at 828. The Smiths, however,\n\ndid not challenge the amount of the fees charged, the nature of the services provided,\n\nor whether the amount reflected the nature and complexity of the case. Id.\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court reversed, but only on the remedy awarded by the\n\ncourt of appeals. Smith, 296 S.W.3d at 548. The supreme court recognized the same\n\nproblem as the court of appeals: “no evidence supported the jury’s refusal to award\n\nany attorney’s fees (as the court of appeals correctly noted).” Id. The supreme court,\n\nhowever, concluded that the remedy had to be a remand to consider the amount of\n\nattorney’s fees in light of the reduction in actual damages. Id.\n\n       Applying the reasoning in Smith, the jury was not free to disregard the\n\nArchers’ uncontradicted evidence that they paid $2,865,928 in attorney’s fees and\n\nlitigation expenses in the prior litigation and arbitrarily pick another number with no\n\nevidentiary basis. Thus, no evidence supports the jury’s 30% reduction of attorney’s\n\nfees that the Archers paid in the earlier litigation in Bexar County by apportioning\n\nliability.\n\n             2.     The Archers proved the entire amount of their attorney’s\n                    fees paid in the Bexar County litigation as a matter of law.\n\n       After reviewing the evidence in support of the jury’s verdict, this Court must\n\nthen consider all of the evidence to determine whether the Archers established their\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\fdamages as a matter of law.

First, Bugg testified about the contentiousness of the litigation from its\n\ninception until its conclusion. 3RR140-147, 151-155, 157-164. According to Bugg,\n\nwhen the Archers could no longer pursue the litigation on an hourly basis, they\n\nconverted to a contingency fee. 3RR155-156.\n\n      Mary Haught, one of the Archers’ former attorneys, provided a detailed\n\nexplanation of the attorney’s fees and litigation expenses that the Archers paid to be\n\nreinstated as beneficiaries under Jack’s will. 6RR26-53. Haught explained that the\n\nArchers converted from an hourly fee arrangement to a contingency fee after\n\nlearning of the disinheritance. 6RR22-26. The contingency fee was based on getting\n\nthe Archers reinstated as beneficiaries and then the law firm received a percentage\n\nof the value of Jack’s estate, including monies brought into Jack’s guardianship\n\nestate through lawsuits against Ted and the attorneys he had hired. 3RR155-56;\n\n6RR23-26; 11RRPlx22 at 2-3. The law firm further agreed to sue the various people\n\nwho had taken money from Jack and receive a percentage of any of that recovery.\n\n\n                                         52\n\f6RR23-26. When the contingency fee contract was entered, the Archers knew they\n\nhad been disinherited. 6RR24.\n\n        Haught then explained the contingency fee calculation. 12RRPlx241. App.\n\nC. 10 The calculation began with calculating the total value of Jack’s estate. Using\n\nthe estate tax return that valued Jack’s estate at $3,848,678 and an agreed upon value\n\nfor Jack’s ranch of $3,730,866, the total estate value of Jack’s estate was $7,579.544.\n\n6RR26-29; 12RRPlx202, Plx241. Monies received as a result of the Bexar County\n\nguardianship lawsuits were added to the total estate value. 6RR29-32; 12RRPlx203\n\n(Adami settlement), Plx204(Hearne Sr. settlement), Plx205, Plx206, Plx207\n\n(Hamilton settlement), Plx241.\n\n        Because the calculation is based on money that was actually received by the\n\nArcher Family, monies that the Archers had to pay to probate Jack’s will and the\n\nmonies paid to settle with the charities were subtracted. 6RR32-35; 12RRPlx241.\n\nThis left $7,256,058 as “litigation proceeds.”\n\n        The firm’s expenses of $538,096 and the fees paid the Archers of $118,454\n\nwere subtracted. 6RR36-39, 39-40; 12RRPlx209, Plx241. This calculation left\n\n$6,599,508 as the amount to which the contingency fee percentage was applied.\n\n6RR40; 12RRPlx241. The firm’s forty-percent contingency fee was $2,639,803.20\n\n\n\n10\n   Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 241 is not in numerical order in the Reporter’s Record. App. C.

App. C. The Archers and the law firm negotiated the total\n\nfee down to $2,865,928. 6RR42,52-53; 12RRPlx241. At the end of the day, the\n\nArchers paid $2,865,928 in attorney’s fees to Ikard & Golden. 6RR53; 12RRPlx\n\n241. Haught went on to explain how the firm was paid as set out on Plx241 page 2.\n\n6RR29-32, 40-53.\n\n      Finally, as set out above, and incorporated here by reference to avoid\n\nrepetition, Frank Ikard testified as the reasonable and necessity of the $2,865,928 in\n\nattorney’s fees paid by the Archers. See supra II.E. at 41.\n\n      Through the testimony of Bugg, Haught, and Ikard, and the exhibits during\n\ntheir respective testimony, the Archers proved as a matter of law the amount of the\n\nattorney’s fees the Archers paid in the prior litigation: $2,865,928. The evidence\n\nsupports only one inference.\n\n      Appellants had every opportunity to challenge the Archers’ evidence on the\n\nattorney’s fees portion of damages. The Archers’ evidence of damages was not\n\ncalled into question on cross-examination and was never controverted. “Clear,\n\ndirect, and uncontroverted evidence of attorney’s fees is taken as true as a matter of\n\nlaw, especially when the opposing party has the means and opportunity to disprove\n\nthe testimony.” B&W Supply, Inc. v.

No evidence supports awarding zero damages for the\n                     settlement with the charities.\n\n        This Court’s first inquiry is to consider the evidence that supports the jury’s\n\nverdict that reduced the Archers’ damages by the amount of the settlement with the\n\ncharities. See Tiller v. McLure, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1624948\"><a href=\"/opinion/1624948/tiller-v-mclure/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713 (Tex. 2003).\n\n        The Archers’ settlement with the charities reinstated them as beneficiaries of\n\nJack’s estate. Had there been no settlement with the charities, the charities would\n\nhave offered for probate the wills Jack signed in 2000 and 2001 that disinherited the\n\nArchers. 6RR64-65; 11RRPlx23 at 8. With multiple wills offered for probate, the\n\nArchers would have been forced into more costly litigation. 6RR64-65. By settling\n\nwith the charities, however, the Archers insured that Jack’s 1991 Will would be\n\nprobated and that the post-stroke wills would not be offered for probate. 11RRPlx23\n\nat 8.\n\n        The Archers paid the twelve charities $588,054, over and above what Jack’s\n\npre-stroke will gave them. 6RR34-35; 12RRPlx241. App. C. The pre-stroke will\n\ngave the charities sixty percent of Jack’s oil and gas interests, valued at $93,522.\n\n12RRPlx241. The Archers gave the charities Jack’s coin collection valued at\n\n$510,028 and paid the charities’ attorney’s fees as part of the settlement. 3RR159-\n\n61; 11RRPlx24.\n\n        Appellants offered no evidence to assail the amount the Archers paid to settle\n\nwith the charities and offered no evidence or argument to exclude the settlement with\n                                           62\n\fthe charities from the Archers’ total damages. Appellants failed to refute Appellee\n\nBugg’s or Haught’s explanation of the need to settle to avoid a will contest with the\n\ncharities. 3RR178-218; 4RR5-32, 51-63; 6RR59-68. The evidence was\n\nuncontroverted. The jury cannot pick a number that was not supported by the\n\nevidence. First State Bank v. Keilman, 851 S.W.2d at 930.\n\n      Accordingly, no evidence supports excluding the amount of the settlement\n\nwith the charities and awarding zero damages for that portion of the Archers’\n\ndamages. The only evidence was that the Archers paid $588,054 to settle with the\n\ncharities and avoid a will contest. Again, no evidence supported the jury’s reduction\n\nof the Archers’ total damages by approximately 58%.\n\n             2.    The Archers proved as a matter of law that they paid\n                   $588,054 to settle with the charities.\n\n      After reviewing the evidence in support of the jury’s omission of the\n\nsettlement with the charities number, this Court must then consider all of the\n\nevidence to determine whether the Archers proved their settlement with the charities\n\nas a matter of law. Dow Chem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at 241; Allman, 314 S.W.3d at 673.\n\n      Bugg testified extensively about the settlement with the charities. 3RR157-\n\n163. The Family Settlement Agreement and the copies of checks paying attorney’s\n\nfees to the charities further substantiated the amounts the Archers paid to the twelve\n\ncharities. 11RRPlx23, Plx24.\n\n\n\n                                         63\n\f      As Jack’s 1991 Will provided, twelve named charities were to split sixty-\n\npercent of Jack’s mineral interests. 11RRPlx9 at 3-4. Bugg testified that, with the\n\nadditional wills Jack signed at Ted Anderson’s insistence, the Archer family was\n\ndisinherited entirely in favor of the charities, meaning that the charities would have\n\nreceived Jack’s entire estate. 3RR156-157; 4RR33-34; 6RR64-66; 12RRPlx241.\n\nBugg further testified that, because the Plaintiffs knew Jack’s long-time estate plan\n\nhad been to leave the bulk of his estate to his family and that he lacked any mental\n\ncapacity to change that estate plan after his stroke, the family would have pursued a\n\nwill contest after Jack’s death. 3RR103. The family, however, chose to avoid\n\nwaiting until Jack’s death and instituted a declaratory judgment action to address the\n\nmultiple wills and multiple trusts before Jack died. 6RR63, 70-71.\n\n      Haught also testified about the Archers’ settlement with the twelve charities.\n\n6RR53-58; 12RRPlx241. Jack’s 1991 Will gave the charities $93,522. 6RR55;\n\n12Plx241. App. C. In settlement with the Archers, the charities also received Jack’s\n\ncoin collection, valued at $510,028. 6RR55; 12RRPlx241. The Archers also paid\n\nthe charities’ attorney’s fees in the declaratory judgment. 6RR55-58; 11RRPlx24.\n\nAccording to Haught, because Jack signed the post-stroke wills, the Archers were\n\nforced to settle with the charities and pay them the $588,054. 6RR58; CR1470-71.\n\nApp. B.\n\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\f      All the evidence supports the opposite of the jury’s finding to omit the\n\ncharities’ settlement amount from the damages awarded. The Archers’ evidence of\n\nthe amounts paid to settle with the twelve charities was uncontroverted and\n\nsupported only one inference. A reasonable jury could not have disregarded the\n\nundisputed evidence of $588,054 as the damages paid to settle with the charities.\n\nAccordingly, the Archers proved the $588,054 settlement with the charities as a\n\nmatter of law. The district court correctly granted Appellants’ motion for partial\n\nJNOV.\n\n      Accordingly, whether based on Appellants’ waiver of Issue 5 or the correct\n\nruling of the district court, Appellants’ Issue 5 should be overruled and the Archers’\n\nCross Issue 2 sustained.\n\nIV.   The district court properly calculated prejudgment interest. [Responsive\n      to Issues 6 & 7]\n\n      The district court calculated prejudgment interest from August 4, 2003\n\nthrough the date of the Final Judgment. CR1470-71, 1461. App. B, K. Appellants\n\nargue that the district court used an incorrect accrual date and that prejudgment\n\ninterest should have been tolled. Appellants’ first argument is waived, and their\n\nsecond argument is refuted by well-established law.\n\n      This Court reviews a prejudgment interest award, and in particular the accrual\n\ndate, under an abuse of discretion standard.

FIN. CODE §§ 304.101; 304.104.\n\n      After learning that Jack’s estate plan had been changed, the Archers filed suit\n\nfor tortious interference with inheritance against Ted and others in the Bexar County\n\nGuardianship Proceeding on February 5, 2003. CR98-117. That filing put Ted on\n\n\n\n                                          66\n\fnotice of the Archers’ claim for tortious interference with inheritance claim for\n\npurposes of the prejudgment interest calculation.\n\n      Without authority, Appellants argue that the Archers could not give notice of\n\ntheir claim until Jack died. Appts. Br. at 33. Contrary to Appellants’ argument, the\n\nArchers tortious interference claim, and the time to file a lawsuit on the claim, arose\n\nlong before Jack died.\n\n      If a will disinherits a person, a will contest can only be brought after a person\n\ndies. TEX. ESTATES CODE §§256.002 (probate of a will of a living person is void),\n\n256.204 (will can only be contested after it is admitted to probate). The theory being\n\nthat a will can be revoked or revised until a person dies.\n\n      The Archers, however, were disinherited in three wills and in a trust. 6RR24;\n\n11RRPlx166, Plx171, Plx172, Plx192, Plx194. All of Jack’s assets were placed in\n\nthe Trust, and when it terminated on Jack’s death, all of the assets were to be divided\n\nsolely among the charities. 6RR153; 11RRPlx171 at 2-3. Because the Trust\n\ninstrument disinherited the Archers, the Archers had to challenge the Trust’s validity\n\n(because of Jack’s lack of capacity to sign it) instead of waiting for Jack to die and\n\nbring a will contest. 6RR70-71.\n\n      The Archers discovered the Trust that disinherited them in early 2001.\n\n3RR149; 11RRPlx171; 12RRPlx218.

Jack’s attorneys stipulated that Jack\n\nwas incapacitated as of February 7, 2002. 11RRPlx34. After that date, Jack could\n\nnot have validly signed a new will or trust. Thus, by February 7, 2002, Jack’s estate\n\nplan was set.\n\n      The Archers faced two dates that started the statute of limitations on their\n\ntortious interference with inheritance claim running: the discovery of the Trust and\n\nthe date of the stipulation of incapacity. The Archers filed suit within two years of\n\nthe earlier date—the discovery the Trust that disinherited them. CR98-117.\n\n      The district court applied the well-established law and calculated prejudgment\n\ninterest from August 4, 2003, 180 days after the Archers filed their original lawsuit\n\nagainst Ted in Bexar County for tortious interference with inheritance. Appellants\n\noffer no legal authority or argument for abandoning the well-established\n\njurisprudence on accrual dates for prejudgment interest calculation. Appts. Br. at\n\n33.

This case is submitted to you by asking questions about the facts, which you must\n\n    decide from the evidence admitted in this trial.\n\n            2.       In arriving at your answers, consider only the evidence, including exhibits,\n\n    admitted in this trial.\n\n            3.       In considering this evidence, you are bound to follow the law set forth in this\n\n    charge, as well as all instructions concerning jurors' conduct that you have been given.\n\n            4.       You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges of\n\n    the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But on matters of law, you\n\n    must follow all of my instructions.\n\n            5.       Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.\n\n            6.

This charge includes all legal instructions and definitions that are necessary to\n\nassist you 1n reaching your verdict, so do not seek out any information in law books or\n\ndictionaries.\n\n        8.       All of the questions and answers are important.          No one should say that any\n\nquestion or answer is not important.\n\n        9.       Do not decide who you think should win and then try to answer the questions\n\naccordingly. Simply answer the questions, and do not concern yourselves with the effect of your\n\nanswers.\n\n        10.      Do not decide the questions by any method of chance.\n\n        11.      Do not answer the questions by adding together each juror's figure and dividing\n\nby the number of jurors to get an average.\n\n        12.      Do not do any trading on your answers. That is, one juror must not agree to\n\nanswer one question a certain way if other jurors will agree to answer another question another\n\nway.\n\n        13.      After you retire to the jury room, you will select a presiding juror. You will then\n\ndeliberate upon your answers.\n\n        14.      It is the duty of that presiding juror:\n                a.      to preside during the deliberations and to provide order and compliance\n                        with the charge;\n                b.      to write, sign, and deliver to the court clerk any communication to me;\n                c.      to conduct the vote and to participate in that vote; and,\n                d.      to write your answers in the spaces provided.\n\n\n                Do you understand the duties of the presiding juror? If you do not, please tell me\nnow.\n        15.     The answers to the questions must be based on the decision of at least 10 of the 12\n\nJurors. The same 10 jurors must agree on every part of an answer, including subparts, unless\n\notherwise instructed. Do not agree to be bound by a vote of anything less than 10 jurors, even if it\n\nwould be a majority.\n                                                                                                  2\n\n\n                                                                    647\n\f                                            DC         BK13164 PG156\n\n\n\n\n        16.      If the verdict is reached by unanimous agreement, the presiding juror will sign the\n\nverdict on the certificate page for the entire jury.\n\n        17.      If 10 jurors agree on every answer, those 10 jurors sign the verdict. If 11 jurors\n\nagree on every answer, those 11 jurors sign the verdict. If all 12 of you agree on every answer,\n\nyou are unanimous and only the presiding juror signs the verdict.\n\n        18.      During your service as jurors, if you observe a violation of my instructions outside\n\nthe jury room, by either a juror or any other person, you must report that to me.\n\n        19.      In your deliberations, any juror who observes a violation of my instructions shall\n\npoint out the violation and caution the offending juror not to violate the instructions again.\n\n       20.       You must not discuss the case with anyone, including other members of the jury,\n\nunless all of the jurors are present and assembled in the jury room. If anyone other than a juror\n\ntries to talk to you about the case before you reach a verdict, tell me immediately.\n\n       21.       When all required questions have been answered, the presiding juror has written\n\nyour answers on the charge, and the verdict has been signed, you will summon the court clerk and\n\nbe returned to court with your verdict.\n\n       When words are used in this charge in a sense which varies from the meaning commonly\n\nunderstood, you are given a proper legal definition, which you are bound to accept in place of any\n\nother meaning.\n\n       Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to all questions unless otherwise instructed. A \"Yes\" answer must\n\nbe based on a preponderance of the evidence unless otherwise instructed. If you do not find that a\n\npreponderance of the evidence supports a \"Yes\" answer, then answer \"No\".\n\n       The term \"PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE\" means the greater weight and\n\ndegree of credible testimony or evidence introduced before you and admitted in this case. A\n\npreponderance of the evidence is not measured by the number of witnesses or by the number of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   3\n\n\n                                                                       648\n\f                                               DC      BK13164 PG157\n\n\n•\n\n\n\n\n    documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, you\n\n    must find that the fact is more likely true than not.\n\n              A fact may be established by \"DIRECT EVIDENCE\" or by \"CIRCUMSTANTIAL\n\n    EVIDENCE\" or both. A fact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary\n\n    evidence or by witnesses who saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established\n\n    by circumstantial evidence when it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts\n\n    proved.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 4\n\n\n                                                                       649\n\f                                             DC     BK13164 PG158\n\n\n•\n\n\n\n                                           QUESTION NO. 1\n\n    Did Ted Anderson tortiously interfere with the Plaintiffs' inheritance from Jack Archer?\n\n           \"Tortious interference\" occurs when one, who by undue influence, duress, breach of\n           fiduciary duties, or other wrongful means, intentionally prevents another from receiving\n           an inheritance or gift that they would otherwise have received.\n\n           \"Undue influence\" means that an influence existed and was exerted, the influence\n           undermined or overpowered the mind of the person executing the documents at the time\n           of their execution, and the person would not have executed the documents but for the\n           influence.\n\n           \"Duress\" is any coercion, whether mental, physical, or otherwise, which causes another\n           person to act contrary to his own free will or to submit to a situation or a condition\n           against his own volition or interest.\n\n           \"Breach of fiduciary duty\" occurs where influence has been acquired and abused, and\n           confidence has been reposed and betrayed.\n\n           An attorney and an attorney-in-fact owe fiduciary duties. Fiduciary duties may also arise\n           out of an informal relationship, whether the relationship is a moral, social, domestic, or\n           purely personal one, such as where a person that is of advanced age and in poor health\n           relies on and trusts another person for support.\n\n\n\n                  Answer \"Yes\" or \"No.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   5\n\n\n                                                                    650\n\f                                              DC      BK13164 PG159\n\n\n•\n\n\n    If you answered \"Yes\" to Question No. 1, then answer the following question. Otherwise, do not\n    answer the following question.\n\n\n                                           QUESTION NO. 2\n\n    What sum of money, if paid now in cash, would fairly and reasonably compensate Plaintiffs for\n    their damages, if any, proximately caused by the tortious interference?\n\n           \"Proximate cause\" means a cause that was a substantial factor in bringing about an event,\n           and without which cause such event would not have occurred. In order to be a proximate\n           cause, the act or omission complained of must be such that a person using the degree of\n           care required of him would have fore seen that the event, or some similar event, might\n           reasonably result therefrom. There may be more than one proximate cause.\n\n           Consider the following element of damages and none other: the difference in value, if\n           any, of the inheritance actually received by Plaintiffs and the value of the inheritance that\n           Plaintiffs would have received from Jack Archer had there been no interference by the\n           Defendant.\n\n    Answer in dollars and cents, if any.\n\n           Answer:~ a?~ /5?'~                      c;:i?\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      6\n\n\n                                                                      651\n\f                                                DC      BK13164 PG160\n\n\n\n\n                                     Cause No. D-1-GN-07-002328\n\nRICHARD T.

M ANDERSON'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL JUDGMENT\n                  NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT\n\n\nTO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE COURT:\n\n       Defendants, T. Mark Anderson, Individually and as co-executor of the Estate of Ted\n\nAnderson, and Christine Anderson, as co-executor of the Estate of Ted M. Anderson file this their\n\nMotion for Partial Judgment Not Withstanding the Verdict, respectfully showing the Court the\n\nfollowing:\n\n                           PROCEDURAL AND FACT SUMMARY\n\n       This case was submitted to the jury on two issues, liability for tortious interference with\n\ninheritance, and damages. The jury found for Plaintiffs on liability and in the single blank under the\n\nquestion on damages wrote in the amount of $2,006,150.\n\n       Plaintiffs evidence on damages consisted of their claim for $588,054 which testimony\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         1210\n\findicated was the amount paid by Plaintiffs to certain charities to secure a settlement with those\n\ncharities to avoid a will contest, and their claim for $2,865,928 in attorneys' fees and expenses paid\n\nin all the prior litigation in the guardianship proceedings which included the litigation with the\n\ncharities. Defendants asserted from the outset that Plaintiffs have no viable claim for recovery of\n\nattorneys' fees as damages in this action, sought to exclude testimony on such damages, objected to\n\nsuch testimony and sought a partial directed verdict on the issue. Because Defendants assert that\n\nTexas law does not permit the recovery of attorneys' fees as damages in a tort case like this one, and\n\nin the alternative, Defendants assert Plaintiffs' evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury's\n\naward of attorneys' fees as part of the Plaintiffs' damages, Defendants bring this motion.\n\n                               ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\n        1. Standard for granting a partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n\n        A partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict is proper if a directed verdict would have\n\nbeen proper. TEX. R. Crv. P. 301. If, as a matter oflaw, the claimant's evidence does not\n\ndescribe a cause of action recognized in Texas, the court may grant a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment. Further the court may disregard any jury finding on a question that has no support in\n\nthe evidence. Id\n\n\n      2. Texas has not adopted the \"tort of another\" exception to the general rule on\nrecovery of attorneys' fees as damages.\n\n        In Turner v. Turner, the case relied upon by Plaintiffs, the supreme court discussed,\n\nwithout expressly adopting, that exception to the general rule that attorney's fees are not\n\navailable as actual damages. Turner v. Turner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2406907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2406907/herring-v-blakeley/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. 230, 234 (Tex. 1965). In Turner,\n\nthe court that the claimant did not meet the criteria of the theory upon which he was\n\n                                                   2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           1211\n\fexpressly relying, and therefore denied his claim for attorneys' fees, without any comment\n\non whether the theory was valid. Id. In 2009, the Texas Supreme Court clarified its earlier\n\nopinion in Turner by stating, \"... we need not and do not address whether the ['tort of\n\nanother'] exception set out in section 914(2) of the Second Restatement should be adopted\n\nas Texas law.

An attorney may segregate either by (1) proving time spent on a\n\n\n                                              4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 1213\n\frecoverable claim and excluding time spent on a non-recoverable claim, or (2) subtracting a\n\npercentage of the time from the total time expended on the case to account time spent on\n\nthe unrecoverable claim. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. at 314.\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs argue they are exempt from the need to segregate because of the\n\nrecognized exception for so called inextricably intertwined legal services. Defendants\n\nassert Plaintiffs do not qualify for the exception in this case. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\nheld that when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim,\n\nand the claims are so intertwined that it is impossible to determine which part of the\n\nattorney's work is attributable to a non-recoverable claim, no segregation is required. Id at\n\n313-14. But where attorney's fees \"relate solely to a claim for which ... fees are\n\nunrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.\" Id. The\n\nSupreme Court explained that a common set of underlying facts is insufficient to make all\n\nclaims arising therefrom 'inseparable' and all legal fees recoverable. Id.\n\n              B. Plaintiffs failed as a matter of law to meet their burden to segregate.\n\n       In our case, Plaintiffs' evidence showed they brought claims against a number of\n\nindividuals in the guardianship action which had nothing to do with their claim of tortious\n\ninterference with inheritance rights against Ted Anderson. For example, they spent a great\n\ndeal of time in pursuit of legal malpractice claims against many defendants, for which the\n\nprobate court and the court of appeals ruled they had no standing. Also, Plaintiffs sought\n\ndamages on behalf of Jack Archer's estate for alleged negligence by Mr. J. R. Hamilton, the\n\n\n                                              5\n\n\n\n                                                                                                1214\n\ftemporary guardian of his estate. In addition, they pursued and settled claims for the\n\nestate against Mr. Doug Hearne for his handling of funds in his law firm's trust accounts\n\nwhich they claimed should have administered by the guardian of the estate. They sued Mr.\n\nBuster Adame, another attorney for Jack Archer; and they sued Ms. Pamela Rucker, the\n\ntemporary guardian of the person of Jack Archer. None of these claims involved Mr.\n\nAnderson.     Plaintiffs presented no evidence of, and did not seek jury findings of a\n\nconspiracy between Mr. Anderson and any other persons they pursued in the probate\n\ncourt.\n\n               C. Plaintiffs evidence is legally insufficient to show reasonableness and\n\nnecessity.\n\n         Plaintiffs had the burden to prove the attorneys fees sought were reasonable and\n\nnecessary.

The jury found for Plaintiffs on liability and in the single blank under the\n\nquestion on damages wrote in the amount of $2,006,150.\n\n       Plaintiffs' alleged damages consisted of their claim for $588,054 which testimony indicated\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         1264\n\fwas the amount paid by Plaintiffs to certain charities to secure a settlement with those charities to\n\navoid a will contest, and their claim for $2,865,928 in attorneys' fees and expenses paid in all the\n\nprior litigation in the guardianship proceedings which included the litigation with the charities.\n\nDefendants assert that Texas law does not recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with\n\ninheritance, as it has never been adopted by the Legislature or the Texas Supreme Court. In the\n\nalternative, and without waiving their right to challenge the legal basis for Plaintiffs' cause of action,\n\nDefendants would show that Plaintiffs have no viable claim for recovery of attorneys' fees as\n\ndamages in this action.\n\n  STANDARD FOR GRANTING MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING\n                          THE VERDICT\n\n\n        1.. If a plaintiff asserts a claim based on a cause of action which is not recognized in\n\nTexas, the trial court is authorized to grant a summary judgment against the plaintiff as to such a\n\nclaim.

Under the\n\ncircumstances, Mr. Anderson should be accorded the protections of the rule laid down\n\nin Barcelo.\n\n    3. Texas has not adopted the \"tort of another\" exception to the general rule on\n   recovery of attorneys' fees as damages.\n\n       In the event the Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs have pleaded and proved a cause\n\nof action recognized in Texas law, which Defendants deny, in the alternative, and without\n\nwaiving their rights to appeal either the viability of Plaintiffs legal theories of this case, or\n\nthe method of its submission to the jury, Defendants would respectfully show the court\n\nthat a significant portion of the damages found by the jury is fatally flawed and lacks\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    1267\n\fsupport in the law.

An attorney may segregate either by (1) proving time spent on a\n\nrecoverable claim and excluding time spent on a non-recoverable claim, or (2) subtracting a\n\npercentage of the time from the total time expended on the case to account time spent on\n\nthe unrecoverable claim. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. at 314.\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs argue they are exempt from the need to segregate because of the\n\nrecognized exception for so called inextricably intertwined legal services. Defendants\n\nassert Plaintiffs do not qualify for the exception in this case. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\nheld that when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim,\n\nand the claims are so intertwined that it is impossible to determine which part of the\n\nattorney's work is attributable to a non-recoverable claim, no segregation is required. Id at\n\n313-14. But where attorney's fees \"relate solely to a claim for which ... fees are\n\nunrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.\" Id. The\n\nSupreme Court explained that a common set of underlying facts is insufficient to make all\n\nclaims arising therefrom 'inseparable' and all legal fees recoverable. Id.\n\n              B.

For example, they spent a great\n\ndeal of time in pursuit of legal malpractice claims against many defendants, for which the\n\nprobate court and the court of appeals ruled they had no standing. Also, Plaintiffs sought\n\ndamages on behalf of Jack Archer's estate for alleged negligence by Mr. J. R. Hamilton, the\n\ntemporary guardian of his estate. In addition, they pursued and settled claims for the\n\nestate against Mr. Doug Hearne for his handling of funds in his law firm's trust accounts\n\nwhich they claimed should have administered by the guardian of the estate. They sued Mr.\n\nBuster Adame, another attorney for Jack Archer; and they sued Ms. Pamela Rucker, the\n\ntemporary guardian of the person of Jack Archer. None of these claims involved Mr.\n\nAnderson.     Plaintiffs presented no evidence of, and did not seek jury findings of a\n\nconspiracy between Mr. Anderson and any other persons they pursued in the probate\n\ncourt.\n\n               C. Plaintiffs evidence is legally insufficient to show reasonableness and\n\nnecessity.\n\n         Plaintiffs had the burden to prove the attorneys fees sought were reasonable and\n\nnecessary.

RATLIFF:     No, Your Honor.\n\n 6                  THE COURT:     All right.   Let's talk about\n\n 7   the charge.\n\n 8                  (Informal Charge Conference.)\n\n 9                  MR. McFARLEN:     I believe the evidence in\n\n10   this case is that at all times when he was acting as his\n\n11   attorney -- in fact, when he -- from everything they did\n\n12   in regard to supervising paying his bills or helping\n\n13   somebody on board to take care of his oil and gas and\n\n14   including hiring attorneys to assist him and represent\n\n15   him in resisting the guardianship that he was acting\n\n16   either as a friend or as his attorney, in fact, pursuant\n\n17   to his power of attorney, and not because they had an\n\n18   existing attorney-client relationships.\n\n19                  THE COURT:     Well, and that's -- and for\n\n20   the plaintiff, it would seem to me we have to look at,\n\n21   you know, the one factor is, of course, is the length of\n\n22   the relationship is one factor that the courts look at,\n\n23   you know.\n\n24                  If you look at the places, they had a long\n\n25   relationship and they included an attorney\n\f                      Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013               88\n                    Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1   relationship -- attorney-client relationship.\n\n 2                    Your position is that at the time in\n\n 3   question, you know, when they are saying that he used\n\n 4   undue influence, it would have been at the time that he\n\n 5   changed his will, he disinherited.\n\n 6                    MR. McFARLEN:   He certainly wasn't an\n\n 7   attorney.\n\n 8                    THE COURT:   That's what I am saying.\n\n 9                    MR. McFARLEN:   My position actually on --\n\n10   including breach of fiduciary duty is the state of the\n\n11   evidence is that, you know, it's -- that the actual\n\n12   breach testified to is the exact, same evidence.         Again,\n\n13   it goes to undue; influence.\n\n14                    Essentially, there are witnesses saying --\n\n15   aside from -- when you said -- two things.        And he said,\n\n16   breach his fiduciary duty by taking the power of\n\n17   attorney, because I don't think that that's within the\n\n18   standard of care for a lawyer to take a power of\n\n19   attorney from a client -- in this case, his former\n\n20   client.     I think that's not very credible.\n\n21                    But he -- part of his assumption or one of\n\n22   his assumptions, part of his basis for that opinion is\n\n23   that Mr. Archer, he accepted the assumption, the\n\n24   testimony of plaintiffs' expert medical witnesses, that\n\n25   Mr. Archer never had capacity after he suffered the\n\f                   Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013                 89\n                 Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1   stroke.\n\n 2                 And I think -- that evidence is, of\n\n 3   course, very much in dispute.\n\n 4                 So other than that, which is is that --\n\n 5   and that, in and of itself, cannot possibly be a\n\n 6   proximate cause of Mr. Archer changing his will.\n\n 7                 There really -- it looks to me like they\n\n 8   are just seeking a second bite at the same apple and an\n\n 9   opportunity to use the same bite that they got of the\n\n10   expert witness about breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n11                 Because the only other testimony -- the\n\n12   rest of his testimony regarding breach of fiduciary duty\n\n13   had to do with his assertion that my client was\n\n14   orchestrating a change of the will and that that -- you\n\n15   know, that that -- those actions, which the Court is\n\n16   already submitting it is undue influence, also amounted\n\n17   to a breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n18                 THE COURT:   We have.\n\n19                 I have struggled with submitting and I am\n\n20   concerned about submitting it this way just as a result\n\n21   of -- you know, depending on what the jury does.     And\n\n22   then if it goes up on appeal, how we can correct it\n\n23   without having to retry it all over again.\n\n24                 That's my concern about all of this.\n\n25                 MR. McFARLEN:     I understand.\n\f                      Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013                90\n                    Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1                    MS. RATLIFF:     On the breach of fiduciary\n\n 2   duty question, I mean, that definition, I mean,\n\n 3   throughout this time, Ted Anderson, Jack Archer had a\n\n 4   fiduciary relationship.     Whether it was under\n\n 5   attorney-client or power of attorney, or just an\n\n 6   informal relationship.     And that's something that\n\n 7   Mr. Boyce went into detail about, the three different\n\n 8   kinds of -- whether you have your law license or whether\n\n 9   you don't or whether you have power of attorney.\n\n10                    At the time he drafted the power of\n\n11   attorney, Ted was an attorney, a licensed attorney at\n\n12   that point.     It's inescapable to me how he can say, I\n\n13   drafted a document and I took it over there and had\n\n14   somebody sign it, that I don't have an attorney-client\n\n15   relationships right there.\n\n16                    Also, how many medical records do we see\n\n17   where it says Ted Anderson, attorney, Ted Anderson,\n\n18   attorney.     Even when he was not licensed.     All those\n\n19   hospital admittance, Pam Rucker, Ted Anderson.        How did\n\n20   they list him as?     Attorney.\n\n21                    He was very loose with that and how he got\n\n22   represented.     To me, it is his duty when he is no longer\n\n23   not a licensed attorney, he should have said, \"Don't\n\n24   call me that anymore.\"\n\n25                    But the evidence is replete that he was an\n\f                     Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013                     91\n                   Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1   attorney and that they had that relationship.        To\n\n 2   support --\n\n 3                    THE COURT:     Just because he's an attorney\n\n 4   doesn't mean he is his attorney, I mean, but --\n\n 5                    MS. RATLIFF:     But why would you list him\n\n 6   that way?\n\n 7                    THE COURT:     You know, a judge -- but they\n\n 8   still call me judge in the State of California.           I'm\n\n 9   still a judge.     It doesn't mean I can go over there and\n\n10   be a judge.\n\n11                    MS. RATLIFF:     I think it's a little\n\n12   different when you are talking about attorney-client\n\n13   relationships.\n\n14                    THE COURT:     And I understand that.     But\n\n15   that -- for our purposes here, though, the only reason I\n\n16   was saying that is we've got an attorney and an\n\n17   attorney, in fact, of fiduciary duties.\n\n18                    And so that was why I was asking, was\n\n19   there any dispute that he was either an attorney or an\n\n20   attorney in fact.     And see, that's why I was asking\n\n21   Mr. McFarlen that point.\n\n22                    MS. RATLIFF:     Or had a close relationship.\n\n23   And that's the second part of that because you have an\n\n24   informal relationship with somebody just, you know, my\n\n25   daughter and I, my husband and I.        That would be an\n\f                      Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013              92\n                    Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1   informal relationship that would rise to the level of\n\n 2   some fiduciary -- maybe not my husband, but -- that's a\n\n 3   bad example.\n\n 4                   But it was clear that he was in such a --\n\n 5   in a mental state that he was and everybody has\n\n 6   testified they were close friends and they relied on\n\n 7   each other.    I mean, that's right there, your informal\n\n 8   relationship to support -- I mean, a fiduciary duty.\n\n 9                   Your Honor, I hear your comment about how\n\n10   you submit this.     But, you know, every case that I read\n\n11   on tortuous interference, and there are actually a lot\n\n12   of them, they all list those -- I mean, fraud, duress.\n\n13                   THE COURT:     I realize that.\n\n14                   MS. RATLIFF:     It's very broad.   The courts\n\n15   of appeals continue to say that.       That's what they mean.\n\n16   They mean for it to be submitted that way.\n\n17                   And the Austin court of appeal in Medina\n\n18   actually quoted a little bit of what was in that charge.\n\n19   I realize that was in Blanco County.       But, I mean,\n\n20   that -- they put it all together.       They didn't try to,\n\n21   you know, cut that apart.\n\n22                   THE COURT:     Well, I was just concerned for\n\n23   purposes of an appeal.       And if the court of appeals\n\n24   thinks I was incorrect in submitting it at all, then we\n\n25   have to retry the whole case.\n\f                     Mark Anderson - May 22, 2013                   93\n                   Cross-Examination by Ms. Ratliff\n\n\n\n 1                    Unless we have them answer yes or no to\n\n 2   undue influence -- no, that's not going to work either.\n\n 3                    MS. RATLIFF:     I think -- I thought about\n\n 4   that, too.    Castillo.   It doesn't raise Castillo because\n\n 5   it is one cause of action.        It is tortuous interference\n\n 6   with inheritance.     Period.\n\n 7                    We don't have three different causes of\n\n 8   action.   It's one.    To me, those have to be defined.        It\n\n 9   means X, Y, Z.     You have to tell them what Y,X and Z\n\n10   mean.\n\n11                    THE COURT:     Okay.   For our purposes here,\n\n12   we've got the charge of the Court.         And let's go into\n\n13   formal charge conference.        I am going to submit it as\n\n14   set out on the proposed charge.\n\n15                    Who is going to assert any objections on\n\n16   behalf of the plaintiff?\n\n17             OBJECTIONS TO JURY CHARGE BY MS. RATLIFF\n18                    MS. RATLIFF:     Your Honor -- are we on the\n\n19   record?\n\n20                    THE COURT:     Yes.\n\n21                    MS. RATLIFF:     Plaintiffs -- and this is\n\n22   only for purposes of preserving what we raised in our\n\n23   partial instructed verdict.\n\n24                    We would submit an objection to Question 2\n\n25   only that it doesn't need to be in the charge because\n\f               Objections to Jury Charge by Ms. Ratliff           94\n                             May 22, 2013\n\n\n\n 1   there is no evidence for the jury to address a damage\n\n 2   question when it has been uncontroverted as we set out\n\n 3   earlier in our motion for partial instructed verdict.\n\n 4                   We have no objection to the form.     It's\n\n 5   been submitted in Question No. 2.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:   Okay.   Objection overruled.\n\n 7             OBJECTIONS TO THE CHARGE BY MR. McFARLEN\n\n 8                   MR. McFARLEN:   Yes, Your Honor.\n\n 9   Defendants would object to the Court's charge on the\n\n10   following grounds.\n\n11                   Number one, that we would object to the\n\n12   failure to include the issue on testamentary capacity.\n\n13                   We will -- defendants object to the\n\n14   wording of the definition of \"tortuous interference,\"\n\n15   one, because it includes -- well, it includes duress.\n\n16                   And actually because it includes undue\n\n17   influence, which has not been held to be an independent\n\n18   tort for which compensatory damages are awarded as\n\n19   opposed to supporting the initiation of a will.\n\n20                   We also object to it for including \"breach\n\n21   of fiduciary duty.\"\n\n22                   And, further, defendants object to the --\n\n23   including a definition of \"undue influence\" for the same\n\n24   reason.\n\n25                   I'm going to object also to the inclusion\n\f              Objections to the Charge by Mr. McFarlen             95\n                            May 22, 2013\n\n\n\n 1   of the definition of \"duress\" for the reason that there\n\n 2   is absolutely no evidence of coercion, mental, physical\n\n 3   or otherwise, no evidence of duress to support the\n\n 4   inclusion of that element.\n\n 5                    And we would further object to inclusion\n\n 6   of a definition of \"breach of fiduciary duty\" because\n\n 7   the breaches for which there is alleged evidence are the\n\n 8   same as for undue influence.           So it constitutes a second\n\n 9   bite at the apple.\n\n10                    Those are all our objections, Your Honor.\n\n11                    THE COURT:     Okay.     The objections will be\n\n12   overruled.     Okay.\n\n13                    Counsel, you've got the questions that I'm\n\n14   submitting to the jury.       And let's just try to save a\n\n15   tree or at least a branch, so I am not making any\n\n16   changes other than taking the word \"draft\" out and the\n\n17   typo.   And I think there was a typo.\n\n18                    What was the typo?\n\n19                    MR. HIGHTOWER:        It said, \"tortuously\n\n20   interfered.\"\n\n21                    THE COURT:     Oh, okay.\n\n22                    MS. RATLIFF:     Actually, is it going to be\n\n23   changed with the \"I\"?\n\n24                    THE COURT:     Yes.\n\n25                    MS. RATLIFF:     We actually got a board made\n\f                             Jury Trial                    177\n                            May 22, 2013\n\n\n\n 1   STATE OF TEXAS     )\n                        )\n 2   COUNTY OF TRAVIS   )\n\n 3       I, Dora M.
