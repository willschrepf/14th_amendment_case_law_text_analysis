Peterson, Curtis W. Knauss, Matthew\nG. Shaw, and Michael T. Cone)for the Plaintiff.\n\nGregory G. Katsas, Acting Assistant Attorney General; Jeanne E.\nDavidson, Director, Patricia M. McCarthy, Assistant Director,\nCommercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, U.S. Department of\nJustice (Reginald T. Blades, Jr.); Aimee Lee and Gardner B. Miller,\nAttorneys, International Trade Field Office, U.S. Department of\nJustice for Defendant United States.\n\n\n     Pogue,    Judge:    In    this    action,    Plaintiff,    Totes-Isotoner\nCorporation (“Totes”), a U.S. importer of men’s gloves, challenges\nthe constitutionality of the tariff rate imposed on its imports.\nTotes claims that by setting out different tariff rates for certain\n“Men’s” gloves and other gloves, the Tariff Schedule violates\nTotes’    right   to   equal    protection       under   the   law   because   it\ndiscriminates on the basis of gender and/or age.\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                             Page 2\n\n       The Defendant United States asks the Court to dismiss Totes’\ncomplaint, claiming that the Court does not have jurisdiction over\nthis matter for two reasons: (1)the Complaint presents a non-\njusticiable political question; and (2)the Plaintiff does not have\na sufficient stake in the matter so as to possess standing to bring\nthis     equal    protection      claim.    USCIT    Rule    12(b)(1).        In   the\nalternative, the government also seeks dismissal under USCIT Rule\n12(b)(5), asserting that Totes’ pleadings fail to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted.\n       Because the Court concludes that Totes’ equal protection\nclaims    properly       invoke    the   Court’s    traditional     role      of-–and\nstandards for-–constitutional review, and that Totes has standing\nto bring its claims, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to dismiss\nfor lack of jurisdiction.           However, because Plaintiff’s Complaint\ndoes     not     plead    sufficient       facts    to     state    a    claim      of\nunconstitutional discrimination, the Court dismisses this matter,\nwithout prejudice, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5).\n       The     Court   exercises    jurisdiction,        pursuant   to   28    U.S.C.\n§ 1581(i)(1), which grants to the court exclusive jurisdiction over\nactions arising out of a law of the United States which provides\nfor “revenue from imports.”\n\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n\n       The Court will discuss, in turn, each of the stated bases for\nthe government’s motion to dismiss: 1. The Political Question\nDoctrine; 2. The Alleged Lack of Constitutional and Prudential\nStanding; and 3. Totes’ Failure to State a Claim.\n\n\n       I. The Political Question Doctrine\n\n\n       In its Complaint, which the government would have us dismiss,\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                        Page 3\n\nTotes pleads that the government classifies “Men’s” leather gloves\nin subheading 4203.2930, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the\nUnited States (“HTSUS”),1 at a duty rate of 14 percent ad valorem,\nwhereas        gloves    “[f]or   other    persons”   are    classified    under\n                                      2\nsubheading 4203.2940, HTSUS,              at the lower duty rate of 12.6\npercent ad valorem.3           Totes alleges that these provisions of the\nHTSUS “discriminate on the basis of gender or age,” Complaint at 1,\nin violation of the Constitution’s Equal Protection guarantee. U.S.\nCONST. amend. XIV, § 1, cl. 2(“[N]o State shall . . . deny to any\nperson    within        its   jurisdiction   the   equal    protection    of   the\n           4\nlaws.”).         Accordingly, the Complaint challenges the extent to\n\n\n     1\n      4203.2930, HTSUS includes subheadings for both lined and\nunlined gloves. 4203.29.3010, HTSUS includes “Articles of\napparel and clothing accessories, of leather or of composition\nleather: Gloves, mittens and mitts: Other: Other: Other: Men’s\n. . . Not lined.” 4203.29.3020, HTSUS includes “Articles of\napparel and clothing accessories, of leather or of composition\nleather: Gloves, mittens and mitts: Other: Other: Other: Men’s\n. . . Lined.”\n     2\n      4203.2950, HTSUS includes “Articles of apparel and clothing\naccessories, of leather or of composition leather: Gloves,\nmittens and mitts: Other: Other: Other: For other persons . . .\nLined.”\n     3\n       For purposes of the Court’s standing determination, the\ngovernment does not contest the factual allegations in Totes’\nComplaint.\n     4\n       Although Totes bases its claim on an alleged violation of\nthe Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person shall be\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of\nlaw, the analysis is the same as that for claims brought under\nthe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Bolling\nv. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 500 (1954) (“In view of our decision\nthat the Constitution prohibits the states from maintaining\nracially segregated public schools, it would be unthinkable that\nthe same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal\nGovernment. We hold that racial segregation in the public\nschools of the District of Columbia is a denial of the due\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                   Page 4\n\nwhich the government may use gender in the classification of goods\nfor importation.\n     Nonetheless, the government argues that this Complaint raises\na non-justiciable political question.       As noted above, however, in\nthe Court’s view, the Complaint seeks review of specific statutory\nprovisions    using    traditional    constitutional   equal   protection\nstandards that have long been interpreted and applied by the\njudicial branch.      As such, Totes’ claim does not intrude into the\nnon-judicial domain.\n     The      political    question      doctrine,     recognizing      our\nconstitutional separation of powers principle, does exclude some\ndisputes from judicial determination.          Under this doctrine, a\nsubject matter is not appropriate for judicial resolution where it\nis exclusively assigned to the political branches or where such\nbranches are better-suited than the judicial branch to determine\nthe matter.    See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 211 (1962);5 Japan\n\n     4\n      (...continued)\nprocess of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the\nConstitution.” (footnote omitted)); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S.\n229, 239 (1976)(“[T]he Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\ncontains an equal protection component prohibiting the United\nStates from invidiously discriminating between individuals or\ngroups.” (citation omitted)). Therefore, the Court applies cases\nrelating to the two amendments in its analysis.\n     5\n       Baker identified six characteristics of cases found\ninappropriate for judicial consideration under the political\nquestion doctrine.\n     Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a\n     political question is found [1] a textually\n     demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to\n     a coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of\n     judicially discoverable and manageable standards for\n     resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding\n     without an initial policy determination of a kind\n     clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the\n     impossibility of a court's undertaking independent\n     resolution without expressing lack of the respect due\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                             Page 5\n\nWhaling Ass’n v. Am. Cetacean Soc’y, 478 U.S. 221, 230 (1986) (“The\npolitical question doctrine excludes from judicial review those\ncontroversies       which    revolve    around   policy     choices      and    value\ndeterminations constitutionally committed for resolution to the\nhalls of Congress or the confines of the Executive Branch. The\nJudiciary is particularly ill suited to make such decisions, as\n‘courts are fundamentally underequipped to formulate national\npolicies or develop standards for matters not legal in nature.’”\n(quoting United States ex rel. Joseph v. Cannon, 642 F.2d 1373,\n1379 (1981)(footnote omitted), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 999 (1982))).\n       Invoking     this    doctrine,    the   government      asserts    that      the\nsubject matter of Plaintiff’s Complaint–-the use of gender in\ntariff classifications--is not appropriate for judicial resolution\nbecause      it   involves    issues    of   trade    policy   reserved        to   the\npolitical branches.          Specifically, the government argues that the\nformation and adoption of the tariff provisions at issue here\ninvolve the negotiation of agreements with foreign governments and\nthat       Plaintiff’s     claim   challenges        the   substance     of     those\ninternational trade agreements. The government argues that there\nare no judicially manageable standards for reviewing the results of\nthese international trade agreements. To the government, “[w]hether\nthe rates provided in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule should be\nequalized with regard to products classified based upon gender or\nage related characteristics is a political question that the Court\nshould decline to adjudicate.” Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss, at 14.\n       Plaintiff properly replies that the specific provisions of the\n\n       5\n      (...continued)\n     coordinate branches of government; or [5] an unusual\n     need for unquestioning adherence to a political\n     decision already made; or [6] the potentiality of\n     embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by\n     various departments on one question.\nBaker, 369 U.S. at 217. The government relies primarily on the\nfirst two characteristics.\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                           Page 6\n\nHTSUS constitute statutes enacted by Congress pursuant to Section\n1204(c) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.6 19\nU.S.C.      §    3004(c).     Citing   this   statutory   structure,    Plaintiff\nreasons that its Complaint is a garden-variety equal protection\nclaim challenging the statute imposing tariffs and in no way\nimplicates the negotiation of international agreements that may\nprecede         statutory   enactment.        Rather   than   intrude   in    areas\ndelegated to the executive or legislative branch, Plaintiff claims\nthat       its    Complaint    invokes    traditional     constitutional      equal\nprotection standards readily subject to judicial administration.\n       In support of its argument, Plaintiff invokes the Supreme\nCourt’s analysis in Japan Whaling, which explains that:\n       [N]ot every matter touching on politics is a political\n       question . . . and more specifically, that it is “error\n       to suppose that every case or controversy which touches\n       foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.” . . .\n            As Baker plainly held, [] the courts have the\n       authority to construe treaties and executive agreements,\n       and   it   goes   without   saying   that    interpreting\n       congressional legislation is a recurring and accepted\n       task for the federal courts. . . . We are cognizant of\n       the interplay between these Amendments and the conduct of\n       this Nation's foreign relations, and we recognize the\n       premier role which both Congress and the Executive play\n       in this field. But under the Constitution, one of the\n       Judiciary's characteristic roles is to interpret\n       statutes, and we cannot shirk this responsibility merely\n       because our decision may have significant political\n       overtones.\n\nJapan Whaling, 478 U.S. at 229-30 (quoting Baker, 369 U.S. at 211).7\n\n\n\n\n       6\n       Further citations to the 1988 Act are to relevant\nprovisions in Title 19 of the U.S. Code, 2000 edition.\n       7\n       For a more extensive discussion of Japan Whaling’s holding\nwith regard to the political question doctrine, see Canadian\nLumber Trade Alliance v. United States, 425 F. Supp. 2d 1321,\n1355-56 (2006).\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                          Page 7\n\n        The Supreme Court’s admonition in Japan Whaling is directly\napplicable here.            In the case before us, even if the challenged\nstatutory provisions originated in international negotiations,\nthose provisions have since been enacted into law as the HTSUS.\nThus,       this   Complaint    does    not   challenge    the   actions   of   the\nPresident or Congress in their respective spheres of responsibility\nfor foreign commerce or foreign relations.                 Rather, it involves\nconstitutional review of a domestic statute.               It has long been the\nrole of the court to adjudicate legislative classifications in view\nof the importance of the governmental interests involved.                       See\nUnited       States    v.    Carolene   Products    Co.,   304   U.S.   144,    153\n(1938)(“Where the existence of a rational basis for legislation\nwhose constitutionality is attacked depends upon facts beyond the\nsphere of judicial notice, such facts may properly be made the\nsubject of judicial inquiry, . . . and the constitutionality of a\nstatute predicated upon the existence of a particular state of\nfacts may be challenged by showing to the court that those facts\nhave ceased to exist.”(citations omitted)).                In the light of this\nhistory and precedent, it is clear that review of statutory\nprovisions, using constitutional standards, is manifestly within\nthe judicial realm.          Such review is, if anything, more appropriate\nhere than in Japan Whaling, which involved evaluation of the\nJapanese whaling industry, a matter even more removed from the\ndomestic realm than that at issue here.\n        Thus, Totes’ challenge to the discriminatory operation of the\nHTSUS       properly   invokes    the    Court’s   traditional     role    of-–and\nstandards for-–constitutional review.              Therefore, the Court denies\nthe government’s request that Totes’ Complaint be dismissed under\nthe political question doctrine.8\n\n\n        8\n       Although the government also argues that Totes’ Complaint\nshould be viewed as raising a political question because the\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                  Page 8\n\n     II. Standing\n\n\n     A. Constitutional Standing\n     Because    federal   judicial    jurisdiction     arises    from   the\nConstitution,   in   order   to   bring   its   case   here,    Totes   must\ndemonstrate that its claim qualifies as a “case” or “controversy”\nfor purposes of Article III of the Constitution, and specifically\nthat it has a sufficient stake in the matter to establish its\n“standing” to bring its claim.       Canadian Lumber Trade Alliance v.\nUnited States, 517 F.3d 1319, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2008)(“There is no\ncase or controversy within the meaning of the Constitution unless\nthe plaintiff has standing.”).\n     To establish a sufficient stake for purposes of Article III\nstanding, plaintiffs must demonstrate: (1)that they have suffered\nsome injury-in-fact; (2)that there is a causal connection between\nthe defendant’s conduct and this injury-in-fact; and (3) that this\ninjury is redressable by the court. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)(“Defenders of Wildlife”)(citations\nomitted).9\n\n\n     8\n      (...continued)\nrelief Totes’ seeks would raise the “potential for embarrassment\nfrom multifarious pronouncements and [contrary to the] need for\nadherence to [a] political decision,” the judiciary’s application\nof the constitutional parameters for gender and age\ndiscrimination to tariff classifications should produce no more\nthan one clear determination. Nor would the remedy Totes seeks\nrequire the government to raise duties on gloves for other\npersons in violation of any international trade agreement; just\nthe contrary. Totes seeks a reduction not an increase in the\nallegedly discriminatory rates. Accordingly, this litigation\ndoes not raise the alternative concern advanced by the\ngovernment.\n     9\n       Because Totes claims a violation of the Constitution’s\nEqual Protection guarantee, we need not be diverted by the\ngovernment’s citation of the absence of a substantive Due Process\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                           Page 9\n\n\n        We consider, in order, each prong of the Defenders of Wildlife\ntest.       First, as noted above, Totes’ Complaint alleges that the\ngovernment has assessed and Totes has paid customs duties at the 14\npercent rate. Complaint at 2.             Thus, Totes alleges that it has\nsuffered an injury in fact-–the loss of money. Second, Totes also\nalleges      that   this   injury    is   a   result    of–-or   caused   by--the\ngovernment’s allegedly discriminatory tariff rates.                   Finally, to\nthe extent this rate is unconstitutionally discriminatory, Totes\nseeks       restoration,   with     interest,   of     any   excess   duty    paid.\nComplaint at 7.       Thus, Totes seeks redress in the form of a return\nof the excess tariffs imposed. Grant of this redress is manifestly\nwithin the historic power of this Court, see, e.g., United States\nv. U.S. Shoe Corp., 523 U.S. 360, 365-66 (1998)(affirming the CIT’s\nconclusion that the Harbor Maintenance Tax is unconstitutional and\nthat duties collected pursuant to the tax must be refunded), and is\nthe requested and likely outcome of this action were Totes to\nprevail. See Litecubes, LLC v. Northern Light Products, Inc., 523\nF.3d 1353, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2008)(“Subject matter jurisdiction does\nnot fail simply because the plaintiff might be unable to ultimately\n\n\n        9\n      (...continued)\nright of importation, see Arjay Associates, Inc. v. Bush, 891\nF.2d 894, 896 (Fed. Cir. 1989)(“[N]o one has a constitutional\nright to conduct foreign commerce in products excluded by\nCongress”), as compared to recognition of a procedural Due\nProcess right. See NEC Corp. v. United States, 151 F.3d 1361,\n1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 1998). “[E]ven though a person has no ‘right’\nto a valuable governmental benefit,” the government “may not deny\na benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his\nconstitutionally protected interests.” Perry v. Sindermann, 408\nU.S. 593, 597 (1972). Because Totes has alleged that the\nchallenged tariff rates infringe upon its interests by\nunconstitutionally discriminating on the basis of gender, the\ngovernment’s assertion that Totes has no vested right to import\nis irrelevant to the analysis of Totes’ standing and to the\nclaims upon which that standing is based.\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                            Page 10\n\nsucceed on the merits.” (citation omitted)).                Accordingly, Totes’\nallegations     provide     a    sufficient   basis       to   establish       Totes’\nconstitutional standing to bring its claim.\n      Despite    the      fact    that    Totes    has     paid     the     allegedly\ndiscriminatory tariff rates, the government argues that Totes’\ninjury is too indirect to permit standing here. To the government,\nbecause the tax imposed by the tariff provision must be paid by all\nimporters of men’s leather gloves, Totes pays the same tariff as\nother similarly situated importers, and is therefore not subject to\ndiscriminatory treatment. But there is no obligation requiring a\nplaintiff challenging an allegedly express suspect governmental\nclassification to plead and prove the existence of a similarly-\nsituated non-protected class.            Brown v. City of Oneonta, 221 F.3d\n329, 337 (2d Cir. 2000)(“Plaintiffs are correct, however, that it\nis not necessary to plead the existence of a similarly situated\nnon-minority group when challenging a law or policy that contains\nan express, racial classification.”), overruled in part on other\ngrounds by Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002).\n      The government also argues that the tariff rates challenged\nhere tax products, not people, and that therefore Totes is not\nitself the object of any prohibited discrimination.                       This issue,\nhowever, was addressed in Craig v. Boren, where a beer vendor was\nallowed by the Supreme Court to pursue the equal protection claims\nof   18-21   year   old    males    against   the    relevant       statute     which\npermitted beer purchases by 18-21 year old females.                         Craig v.\nBoren,   429    U.S.   190,      194-7   (1976).         “[W]here    a     person   is\neffectively used by the government to implement a discriminatory\nscheme,” he may invoke the rights of the infringed to challenge\nthat scheme.    Fraternal Order of Police v. United States, 152 F.3d\n998, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 1998).          If anything, Totes’ role as payor of\nthe allegedly discriminatory tax makes its standing here more\ndirectly connected to that scheme than the interest of the beer\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                          Page 11\n\nvendor found sufficient in Craig.10\n\n\n     B. Prudential Standing\n     In addition to challenging Totes’ constitutional standing to\nbring this case, the government also argues that Totes lacks\nstanding for “prudential” reasons. See Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass'n,\n479 U.S. 388, 396 (1986)(“‘[T]he interest sought to be protected by\nthe complainant [must be] arguably within the zone of interests to\nbe protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee\nin question.’” (quoting Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Org., Inc.\nv. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970))).      This “zone of interest”\nrequirement “denies a right of review if the plaintiff’s interests\nare [] marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\nimplicit” in the constitutional guarantee invoked. Clarke, 479 U.S.\nat 399.\n      The Supreme Court has further maintained that the “zone of\ninterest” test operates under the presumption that agency actions\nare subject to judicial review, and therefore, the test “is not\nmeant to be especially demanding; in particular, there need be no\n\n\n     10\n      Although Totes’ claim that the Constitution “prohibits the\ndefendant from discriminating in the assessment of taxes or\nduties on the basis of gender or age,” (Complaint at 5), could\ngive rise to further analysis of Totes’ possible third-party\nstanding on behalf of adult male purchasers of gloves, Totes\nexpressly indicated at oral argument that it does not seek\nderivative or third-party standing such as that recognized by\nCraig or Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991). It is therefore\nunnecessary to determine whether Totes’ allegations would\nindicate that “enforcement of the challenged [provision] . . .\nwould result indirectly in the violation of third parties’\nrights.” Craig, 429 U.S. at 195 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422\nU.S. 490, 510 (1975)); see also Craig, 429 U.S. at 196\n(\"[C]rucial to the decision to permit jus tertii standing [is]\nthe recognition of ‘the impact of the litigation on the third-\nparty interests.’” (quoting Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438,\n445 (1972))).\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                         Page 12\n\nindication    of    congressional      purpose    to   benefit      the    would-be\nplaintiff.” Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399-400 (citation and footnote\nomitted); see also Nat’l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat’l Bank &\nTrust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488-9 (1998)(“Although our prior cases have\nnot stated a clear rule for determining when a plaintiff's interest\nis ‘arguably within the zone of interests’ to be protected by a\nstatute, they nonetheless establish that we should not inquire\nwhether there has been a congressional intent to benefit the would-\nbe plaintiff.”).      Rather, the zone of interest test only “denies a\nright of review if the plaintiff's interests are [] marginally\nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute\n. . . .” Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399; see also Kemet Elecs. Corp. v.\nBarshefsky,    21    CIT     912,   927-28,      976   F.   Supp.       1012,   1026\n(1997)(citing Clarke).\n     The constitutional equal protection guarantee at issue in this\ncase clearly protects against discrimination on the basis of sex.\nCraig v. Boren, 429 U.S. at 197.           Because Totes alleges that its\ninjury is the direct result of prohibited discrimination, which is\nboth facial and express, Totes’ claim is not “marginally related to\nor inconsistent with the purposes” of the equal protection clause.\n     Accordingly, because Totes’ claim, as alleged, is within the\nzone of interests protected by the Constitution’s Equal Protection\nguarantee, there is no prudential reason to deny Totes standing to\nlitigate its claim.\n\n\n     III. Failure to State a Claim\n\n\n     We turn now to the adequacy of Totes’ factual pleadings,\nexplaining why Totes’ Complaint, as presently drafted, fails to\n“show” the necessary entitlement to relief.\n     As   noted     above,    Totes’    Complaint      alleges      a    prohibited\ngovernmental classification “based on sex.” The applicable pleading\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                  Page 13\n\nrequirements, however, as set out in Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), and\nrecently explained by the Supreme Court in              Bell Atl. Corp. v.\nTwombly,___ U.S. ___, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1964 (2007)(“Bell Atlantic”),\nmandate   “more    than   labels    and   conclusions,   and   a   formulaic\nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell\nAtlantic, 127 S. Ct. at 1964-65 (citation omitted). While it is not\nnecessary for a plaintiff to provide detailed factual allegations,\nthe factual allegations asserted must still be “enough to raise a\nright to relief above the speculative level . . . on the assumption\nthat all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful\nin fact).”    Id. at 1965 (citation omitted).11            In so doing, a\nplaintiff must still provide “‘a short and plain statement of the\nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,’ in order to\ngive the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the\ngrounds upon which it rests.” Id. at 1964 (citing Conley v. Gibson,\n355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).12\n     While the contours of this requirement have not yet been\nbroadly addressed by the Federal Circuit, other circuits have\nconsidered   the   issue.     The   Second   Circuit,    for   example,   has\ninterpreted Bell Atlantic as “requiring a flexible ‘plausibility\nstandard,’ which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim with some\nallegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to\nrender the claim plausible.”        Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 157-58\n\n\n     11\n      In Bell Atlantic, the Court disavowed the oft-cited\nstandard set forth in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46\n(1957), that “a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to\nstate a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff\ncan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would\nentitle him to relief.” Bell Atlantic, supra, 127 S. Ct. at 1959-\n60.\n     12\n       The Federal Circuit has indicated that Bell Atlantic does\nnot alter notice pleading as a requirement or practice. McZeal v.\nSprint Nextel Corp., 501 F.3d 1354, 1357-8 (Fed. Cir.\n2007)(discussing the “low bar” for pro se plaintiffs).\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                             Page 14\n\n(2d    Cir.   2007)(emphasis     omitted).              As   the   Third   Circuit    has\nexplained, “there must be some showing sufficient to justify moving\nthe case beyond the pleadings to the next stage of litigation.”\nPhillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234-5 (3d Cir. 2008).\n       Here, we must apply Bell Atlantic’s pleading requirement to\nTotes’ equal protection claim.          In order to state such a claim for\nviolation of the equal protection clause based on gender, Totes must\nallege      that     the   government     has           engaged     in     gender-based\ndiscrimination without an exceedingly persuasive justification, or\nin other words, that the government has used discriminatory means\nthat    are   not    substantially     related          to   important     governmental\nobjectives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532-33 (1996);\nCraig v. Boren, 429 U.S. at 197 (1971)(“To withstand constitutional\nchallenge . . . classifications by gender must serve important\ngovernmental        objectives   and   must        be    substantially      related    to\n                                              13\nachievement of those objectives.”).                 In so doing, Totes’ complaint\nmust include a factual allegation that demonstrates a governmental\npurpose to discriminate.          Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242\n(1976)(noting that “an invidious discriminatory purpose may often\nbe inferred from the totality of the relevant facts . . .”).\nWhether the prohibited discrimination is overt or covert, Personnel\nAdm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 273 (1979), Totes’ Complaint\nmust allege facts sufficient to “show” some purpose or intent to\ndisfavor individuals because of their sex, though such purpose or\nintent need not be malicious.           Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health\nClinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270-1 (1993).                     In Bray, the Court stated:\n\n\n       13\n       Because the pleading requirements for invidious\ndiscrimination based on age are not less than for such\ndiscrimination based on sex, Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528\nU.S. 62, 83 (2000)(“States may discriminate on the basis of age\nwithout offending the Fourteenth Amendment if the age\nclassification in question is rationally related to a legitimate\nstate interest.”), we need not discuss them separately.\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                       Page 15\n\n     We do not think that the “animus” requirement can be met\n     only by maliciously motivated, as opposed to assertedly\n     benign (though objectively invidious), discrimination\n     against women. It does demand, however, at least a\n     purpose that focuses upon women by reason of their sex-\n     for example (to use an illustration of assertedly benign\n     discrimination), the purpose of “saving” women because\n     they are women from a combative, aggressive profession\n     such as the practice of law. . . .\n          . . . Some activities may be such an irrational\n     object of disfavor that, if they are targeted, and if\n     they also happen to be engaged in exclusively or\n     predominantly by a particular class of people, an intent\n     to disfavor that class can readily be presumed. A tax on\n     wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews.\n\nId. at 269-70 (emphasis omitted).\n     A facial or express gender-based classification may, of course,\nindicate a discriminatory purpose, see, e.g., Cmtys. for Equity v.\nMich. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 459 F.3d 676, 694 (6th Cir.\n2006)(“Disparate     treatment    based    upon     facially      gender-based\nclassifications    evidences     an   intent   to   treat   the    two    groups\ndifferently”), and Totes’ Complaint does allege the express use of\ngender in the tariff classification scheme. The Complaint, however,\ndoes not allege discrimination “based on” gender, i.e., that the\nduty or tax imposed by the tariff classification, or any burden\nresulting from that tax, is imposed because of or based on gender\nor otherwise disfavors individuals because of their gender.                Thus,\nthe Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to establish that the\ngovernment has engaged in gender-based discrimination.                   This is\nbecause the tariff provisions that Totes challenges are not “actual\nuse” provisions, i.e., the tariff provisions at issue do not require\nthat the imported goods be actually sold to or used by people of one\nsex or of some age category.14\n\n\n     14\n       Rather, the challenged classifications indicate “chief”\nor “principal” use, and it is well established that where\n                                                    (continued...)\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                    Page 16\n\n     To classify imports as men’s gloves, or gloves “for other\npersons” does not establish that they will be bought by or used by\nmen, or that men will necessarily pay the allegedly discriminatory\ntax. “For” is used to indicate objective. Thus the mere allegation\nthat the HTSUS classifies or labels goods as imported “for” persons\nof one sex does not establish that those classifications are “on the\nbasis of” or “by” gender.        “On the basis of” indicates foundation\nor fundamental element rather than objective.           As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Comm’n of\nWebster Country, W. Va., 488 U.S. 336, 343 (1989), “[t]he Equal\nProtection Clause applies only to taxation which in fact bears\nunequally on persons or property of the same class.” (internal\nquotations omitted)(emphasis added).15\n     According to Totes’ Complaint, by distinguishing between men’s\ngloves    and   gloves   for   women,   the   HTSUS   distinguishes   between\nproperty of the same class (leather gloves), and this discrimination\nis made on the basis of the gender and/or age of the intended user.\nPl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss 38 (“Pl.’s Br.”).               But the\nfacts alleged–-merely “distinguishing” between gloves for men and\ngloves for other persons–-are not sufficient to show discrimination\n\n     14\n      (...continued)\nclassification is proper under the doctrine of chief (now\nprincipal) use, there must be proof of such use. Advance\nSolvents & Chemical Corp. v. United States, 34 CCPA 148, 151\n(1947).\n     15\n       Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal involved the implementation of\nstate law, and the different methods used to assess property\nvalues for recently-purchased properties as opposed to property\nheld for a longer time. Recognizing that a State “may divide\ndifferent kinds of property into classes and assign to each class\na different tax burden,” the Court applied a low level of\nscrutiny, explaining that the state’s ability to assign these\ndifferent tax burdens existed “so long as those divisions and\nburdens are reasonable.” Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal, 488 U.S. at\n344 (citing Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 522, 526-27\n(1959)(“Bowers”)).\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                                    Page 17\n\n“on the basis of” sex.16          Moreover, the discrimination alleged in\nTotes’s Complaint, results from the imposition of the duty, or tax,\nimposed by the tariff classifications. Complaint at 6. But, as\nalleged in the Complaint, that duty or tax falls on importers, and\nthere     is    no    factual    indication   in   the   Complaint   that    the\nclassification results in a discriminatory application of the tax.17\nTherefore, Totes’ additional allegation of discrimination “on the\nbasis of sex” is simply conclusory, in violation of the Bell\nAtlantic requirement.           See also Judge v. City of Lowell, 160 F.3d\n67, 75 (1st Cir. 1998) (requiring “specific, nonconclusory factual\nallegations giving rise to a reasonable inference of racially\ndiscriminatory intent”).          After Bell Atlantic, it appears that the\nPlaintiff is required to allege facts that could provide a showing\nthat Totes is entitled to relief.\n     To    be    clear,    were    this   a   facially   discriminatory     tax,\nPlaintiff’s pleadings could be sufficient; in addition, we do not\nignore the fact that the tariff schedule makes an express reference\nto gender.           Nor do we assume that this express reference is\nnecessarily benign.         Nonetheless, because the challenged tariff\nclassifications are, at worst, “in between” classifications that\nimpose a facially discriminatory tax and classifications that are\nnot facially discriminatory, Plaintiff must at least include an\n\n     16\n       Totes agrees, for example, that it would not be gender-\nbased discrimination for the government to “classify” goods for\nstatistical purposes on the basis of the gender of the intended\nwearer of those goods.\n     17\n        Cf. Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, ___U.S.___,\n2008 WL 2329768 at *6 (June 9, 2008)(“Our equal protection\njurisprudence has typically been concerned with governmental\nclassifications that ‘affect some groups of citizens differently\nthan others.’” (quoting McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425\n(1961))). Nor can Plaintiff claim that the alleged\ndiscrimination affects importers differently based on gender.\nRather, the tariff classifications affect importers based on the\ngoods they import.\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                               Page 18\n\nallegation that the challenged tariff classifications distribute the\nburdens of the tax rate imposed in a way that disadvantages one sex\nas a whole, or has a disproportionate impact based on sex.         To the\nextent that the challenged tariff provisions do not impose a\nfacially discriminatory tax, Plaintiff must include an allegation\nof   some   intent   that   renders   plausible   the   claim   that   the\ndiscrimination at issue is invidious, arbitrary or unreasonable.18\nIn the absence of such allegations, the Complaint does not provide\n“plausible grounds to infer” a violation of equal protection or\nallege “enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery\n[or further proceedings on the merits] will reveal evidence of\nillegal” conduct.      Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct. at 1965. While\nclassification of goods as “for” men–-or for other persons-–may\nsuggest discrimination, it does not “show” it.           As pleaded, we\nsimply are not informed of a discriminatory purpose or intent or of\nthe character of the discrimination that Totes seeks to remedy.        We\nare left to hypothesize: Is the challenged discrimination based on\nthe baggage of sexual stereotypes?         Does it unconstitutionally\ndistribute the benefits and burdens of taxation?        Is it prohibited\nintentional discrimination?      Because the Complaint, as presently\nstated, does not “show” what the basis of Totes’ entitlement is, it\nmust be dismissed, without prejudice, for failure to state a claim.\n\n\n                                                  /s/Donald C.

USCIT    Rule    12(b)(1).        In   the\nalternative, the government also seeks dismissal under USCIT Rule\n12(b)(5), asserting that Totes’ pleadings fail to state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted.\n       Because the Court concludes that Totes’ equal protection\nclaims    properly       invoke    the   Court’s    traditional     role      of-–and\nstandards for-–constitutional review, and that Totes has standing\nto bring its claims, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to dismiss\nfor lack of jurisdiction.           However, because Plaintiff’s Complaint\ndoes     not     plead    sufficient       facts    to     state    a    claim      of\nunconstitutional discrimination, the Court dismisses this matter,\nwithout prejudice, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5).\n       The     Court   exercises    jurisdiction,        pursuant   to   28    U.S.C.\n§ 1581(i)(1), which grants to the court exclusive jurisdiction over\nactions arising out of a law of the United States which provides\nfor “revenue from imports.”\n\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n\n       The Court will discuss, in turn, each of the stated bases for\nthe government’s motion to dismiss: 1.

Specifically, the government argues that the\nformation and adoption of the tariff provisions at issue here\ninvolve the negotiation of agreements with foreign governments and\nthat       Plaintiff’s     claim   challenges        the   substance     of     those\ninternational trade agreements. The government argues that there\nare no judicially manageable standards for reviewing the results of\nthese international trade agreements.

Citing   this   statutory   structure,    Plaintiff\nreasons that its Complaint is a garden-variety equal protection\nclaim challenging the statute imposing tariffs and in no way\nimplicates the negotiation of international agreements that may\nprecede         statutory   enactment.        Rather   than   intrude   in    areas\ndelegated to the executive or legislative branch, Plaintiff claims\nthat       its    Complaint    invokes    traditional     constitutional      equal\nprotection standards readily subject to judicial administration.\n       In support of its argument, Plaintiff invokes the Supreme\nCourt’s analysis in Japan Whaling, which explains that:\n       [N]ot every matter touching on politics is a political\n       question . . . and more specifically, that it is “error\n       to suppose that every case or controversy which touches\n       foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.” . . .\n            As Baker plainly held, [] the courts have the\n       authority to construe treaties and executive agreements,\n       and   it   goes   without   saying   that    interpreting\n       congressional legislation is a recurring and accepted\n       task for the federal courts. . . . We are cognizant of\n       the interplay between these Amendments and the conduct of\n       this Nation's foreign relations, and we recognize the\n       premier role which both Congress and the Executive play\n       in this field. But under the Constitution, one of the\n       Judiciary's characteristic roles is to interpret\n       statutes, and we cannot shirk this responsibility merely\n       because our decision may have significant political\n       overtones.\n\nJapan Whaling, 478 U.S. at 229-30 (quoting Baker, 369 U.S. at 211).7\n\n\n\n\n       6\n       Further citations to the 1988 Act are to relevant\nprovisions in Title 19 of the U.S. Code, 2000 edition.\n       7\n       For a more extensive discussion of Japan Whaling’s holding\nwith regard to the political question doctrine, see Canadian\nLumber Trade Alliance v.

In the case before us, even if the challenged\nstatutory provisions originated in international negotiations,\nthose provisions have since been enacted into law as the HTSUS.\nThus,       this   Complaint    does    not   challenge    the   actions   of   the\nPresident or Congress in their respective spheres of responsibility\nfor foreign commerce or foreign relations.                 Rather, it involves\nconstitutional review of a domestic statute.               It has long been the\nrole of the court to adjudicate legislative classifications in view\nof the importance of the governmental interests involved.

In the light of this\nhistory and precedent, it is clear that review of statutory\nprovisions, using constitutional standards, is manifestly within\nthe judicial realm.          Such review is, if anything, more appropriate\nhere than in Japan Whaling, which involved evaluation of the\nJapanese whaling industry, a matter even more removed from the\ndomestic realm than that at issue here.\n        Thus, Totes’ challenge to the discriminatory operation of the\nHTSUS       properly   invokes    the    Court’s   traditional     role    of-–and\nstandards for-–constitutional review.

Nor can Plaintiff claim that the alleged\ndiscrimination affects importers differently based on gender.\nRather, the tariff classifications affect importers based on the\ngoods they import.\n\fCourt No. 07-00001                                               Page 18\n\nallegation that the challenged tariff classifications distribute the\nburdens of the tax rate imposed in a way that disadvantages one sex\nas a whole, or has a disproportionate impact based on sex.         To the\nextent that the challenged tariff provisions do not impose a\nfacially discriminatory tax, Plaintiff must include an allegation\nof   some   intent   that   renders   plausible   the   claim   that   the\ndiscrimination at issue is invidious, arbitrary or unreasonable.18\nIn the absence of such allegations, the Complaint does not provide\n“plausible grounds to infer” a violation of equal protection or\nallege “enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery\n[or further proceedings on the merits] will reveal evidence of\nillegal” conduct.      Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct. at 1965. While\nclassification of goods as “for” men–-or for other persons-–may\nsuggest discrimination, it does not “show” it.           As pleaded, we\nsimply are not informed of a discriminatory purpose or intent or of\nthe character of the discrimination that Totes seeks to remedy.        We\nare left to hypothesize: Is the challenged discrimination based on\nthe baggage of sexual stereotypes?         Does it unconstitutionally\ndistribute the benefits and burdens of taxation?        Is it prohibited\nintentional discrimination?      Because the Complaint, as presently\nstated, does not “show” what the basis of Totes’ entitlement is, it\nmust be dismissed, without prejudice, for failure to state a claim.\n\n\n                                                  /s/Donald C.
