Kulp1 and Carol L. Kulp, are the parents of Timothy M.\n\nKulp, (“Kulp”) who committed suicide while incarcerated at the Centre County Prison\n\n(the “Prison”) in Pennsylvania. The parents commenced an action in the District Court\n\nagainst the appellees, employees of the Prison, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state\n\nlaw. They appeal from orders of the District Court dismissing their First Amended\n\nComplaint (the “Complaint”) pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\n\nclaim. We will reverse.\n\n                                         I. Background\n\n        The Complaint named ten persons as defendants in their individual and official\n\ncapacities. Because the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss under\n\nRule 12(b)(6), we take the factual background of this case from the Complaint and accept\n\nall allegations contained therein as true. ALA, Inc. v. CCAIR, Inc., 29 F.3d 855, 859 (3d\n\n        *\n          Honorable Dickinson R. Debevoise, Senior District Court Judge for the District of New\nJersey, sitting by designation.\n        1\n            Timothy D. Kulp appeals individually and as administrator of the estate of Timothy M.\nKulp.\n\n                                                 2\n\fCir. 1994).\n\n       Lieutenants Sonia Veruette and Smith were responsible for implementing\n\nappropriate policies of the Prison, supervising its staff and pretrial detainees, and\n\nestablishing suicide watch and appropriate observation of pretrial detainees. Shannon\n\nQuick and Timothy Gallu were counseling or healthcare employees at the Prison.\n\nCorrectional Officers Knepp, McClellan, Andrews, Shearer, Gates and Stefanko had\n\nresponsibility for executing appropriate policies and procedures at the Prison, supervising\n\npretrial detainees and, among other duties, implementing suicide watch and appropriate\n\nobservation and handling pretrial detainees requiring suicide watch.\n\n       On or about 2:20 a.m. on August 26, 2001, eighteen year old Kulp was committed\n\nto the Prison as a pretrial detainee on charges of burglary, criminal attempt at burglary,\n\ncriminal trespass, misdemeanor indecent assault and summary harassment. The\n\ncommitment documentation, consisting of a Police Criminal Complaint and Affidavit of\n\nProbable Cause, reflected that Kulp, while drunk and after smoking marijuana, entered,\n\nwithout the consent or knowledge of the occupants, the dormitory rooms of at least three\n\nsleeping Penn State female students, lay next to them, and indecently fondled them during\n\nthe early morning hours of August 25.\n\n       During Kulp’s commitment, Officer McClellan noted that he had alcohol addiction\n\nand mental illness, and that he was cooperative but upset. Officer Knepp conducted a\n\nsuicide prevention screening at about 2:30 a.m. He knew or should have known of the\n\ncommitment documentation and the Inmate Commitment Summary Report. Officer\n\n                                              3\n\fKnepp noted on Kulp’s Suicide Prevention Screening Questionnaire that Kulp was\n\nworried about his current situation, but, contrary to all the documentation previously\n\nreferred to, incorrectly noted on the Questionnaire that Kulp did not have a psychiatric\n\nhistory or take psychiatric medication, that his alleged crime was not shocking in nature,\n\nand that Kulp did not show signs of depression or appear anxious, afraid, angry,\n\nembarrassed, or ashamed. Officer Knepp reported on the Questionnaire that he did not\n\nnotify the Shift Commander or refer Kulp to Mental Health. As a result of the\n\nQuestionnaire Kulp was assigned to an initial 48 hours administrative segregation under\n\nregular supervision.\n\n       Officer Knepp failed to complete the Questionnaire accurately and failed to notify\n\nthe Shift Commander of Kulp’s condition. He failed to refer Kulp to Mental Health and\n\nfailed to take steps to obtain a mental health examination or further health treatment. He\n\ndid not have Kulp placed on a suicide watch, and he did not have Kulp appropriately\n\nobserved, nor did he remove from Kulp’s possession items that could be used in a suicide\n\nattempt.\n\n       At about 7:52 a.m. on August 26, Quick, the counselor and healthcare employee,\n\nexamined Kulp. She knew or should have known the contents of all the foregoing\n\ndocumentation. Kulp informed Quick that his motive for the charged crimes was that he\n\nwanted to wake up next to another person, implying loneliness, depression, and/or\n\nanother vulnerable emotional or mental state.\n\n       Quick noted in her Consultation Record that Kulp: (a) was depressed, labile,\n\n                                             4\n\ftearful, confused and anxious; (b) expressed problems with his family and suffered from\n\nalcohol and marijuana abuse; (c) had relationship issues and mood swings with impulsive\n\nbehavior; (d) had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but declined to take his\n\nmedication; (e) was having passive suicidal thought in the form of believing that things\n\ncould not get worse; and (f) was very anxious about his arrest and related his current\n\nsituation to family and friends. Quick further noted that, although she did not believe\n\nKulp appeared to pose a threat to himself at that time, he had the potential to\n\ndecompensate rapidly. Quick recommended that Kulp see a counselor, be placed in a cell\n\nby the guards, and be under observation. She failed specifically to request that Kulp be\n\nplaced on a suicide watch and failed to report his vulnerability so that it could be properly\n\nacted upon. She failed to have Kulp appropriately observed, and she did not have\n\nremoved from Kulp’s possession items that could be used in a suicide attempt.\n\n       Lieutenant Smith, who knew or should have known of all of the previously\n\nmentioned documentation, noted at about 7:52 a.m. on August 26, 2001, that Quick had\n\nreported that Kulp was not a threat to himself at that time, that Kulp should see a prison\n\ncounselor the next day and that an eye should be kept on Kulp. Knowing of Kulp’s\n\nvulnerability to suicide from the above documentation, Lieutenant Smith nevertheless\n\nfailed to have Kulp placed on suicide watch, or to have Kulp appropriately observed. He\n\nfailed to remove from Kulp’s possession items which could be used in a suicide attempt.\n\n       Lt. Veruette had the responsibility of assigning Kulp’s cell and observation status.\n\nShe knew, or should have known, on the basis of the contents of the aforementioned\n\n                                              5\n\fdocumentation, that Kulp had a particular vulnerability to suicide and should be kept\n\nunder observation. She assigned Kulp to Cell No. THU1, failing to have Kulp placed on\n\nsuicide watch or appropriately observed. She failed to have removed from Kulp’s\n\npossession items that could be used in a suicide attempt.\n\n       Gallu, a prison counsel, examined Kulp at 3:30 p.m. on August 26. He knew or\n\nshould have known of the previously mentioned documentation. He reported about his\n\nconsultation after Kulp committed suicide, stating that “(a) Kulp was quiet and polite; (b)\n\nthey discussed Kulp’s family and mental health history; (c) Kulp informed Defendant\n\nGallu of his bipolarism and refusal to take his medication; (d) Defendant Gallu told Kulp\n\nthat he would like to refer him to the MH/MR Unit of Centre County so that he could be\n\nevaluated and possibly set up with a psychiatrist, urged Kulp to take his medication, and\n\nstated that now might be a good time to get help. Kulp agreed and said he would meet\n\nwith a Mental Health Liaison. When asked if he were suicidal or had a history of suicide,\n\nKulp replied in the negative.” (Complaint, para. 32.)\n\n       Based upon his observations and the various reports, Gallu knew, or should have\n\nknown, that Kulp had a particular vulnerability to suicide. Nevertheless, he failed to take\n\nappropriate action. Instead he wrote that Kulp gave no indication of a desire to harm\n\nhimself and reported that information to a Deputy Warden of the prison.\n\n       Kulp received no further counseling or mental health examination or treatment.\n\nHe was not placed in a suicide watch, nor were items which could be used in a suicide\n\nattempt taken from him.\n\n                                             6\n\f       On August 27, 2001, at about 10:30 p.m., Lieutenant Veruette and Officers\n\nMcClellan, Andrews, Shearer, Gates and Stefanko were on duty at the prison. Officers\n\nMcClellan, Andrews and Shearer conducted a routine watch tour of the prison housing\n\nareas and observed Kulp sitting on his bed. All of these officers knew, or reasonably\n\nshould have known, that they were to keep Kulp under observation as a potential suicide\n\nrisk but failed to do so. They also failed to remove from him items which he could use in\n\ncommitting suicide. At approximately 11:06 p.m., when he could not see Kulp from the\n\nmain door of the THU housing area, McClellan entered the housing area and found Kulp\n\nhanging by a shoelace around his neck.\n\n       In addition to alleging these facts, the Complaint alleged generally that each prison\n\nemployee acted with deliberate indifference to Kulp’s vulnerability to suicide, and that\n\ntheir actions and inactions caused Kulp’s death in violation of his right to life, liberty and\n\nproperty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n                           II. The District Court Proceedings\n\n       The Prison employees filed three motions to dismiss the original complaint. The\n\nDistrict Court granted each of the motions without prejudice to the right of the parents to\n\nfile an amended complaint. The parents filed their First Amended Complaint (the\n\nComplaint), which dropped a number of defendants but changed little else of substance.\n\nThereupon Quick moved to dismiss the Complaint, and subsequently the other Prison\n\nemployees did likewise. The District Court granted the motions, dismissing the federal\n\nclaims with prejudice and dismissing the state law claims without prejudice to the\n\n                                              7\n\fparents’ right to pursue those claims in the State Court.”2 This appeal followed.\n\n                        III. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. We\n\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We have plenary review over a district\n\ncourt’s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and we review the District\n\nCourt’s decision de novo, applying the same legal standard as the trial court to the same\n\nrecord. Lum v. Bank of America, 361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir. 2004); Omnipoint\n\nCommc’ns Enters., L.P. v. Newtown Twp., 219 F.3d 240, 242 (3d Cir. 2000). A motion\n\nto dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted only if, “accepting as true\n\nthe facts alleged and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom,” there is no\n\nreasonable reading upon which the plaintiff may be entitled to relief. Colburn v. Upper\n\nDarby Twp., 838 F.2d 663, 665-66 (3d Cir. 1988) (Colburn I).\n\n                                       IV. Discussion\n\n       The District Court fully recognized the limited circumstances in which a motion to\n\ndismiss a complaint can be granted and emphasized the heavy burden a plaintiff carries in\n\na prison suicide case brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Colburn v. Upper Darby\n\nTownship, 946 F.2d 1017 (3d Cir. 1991) (Colburn II). The plaintiff in such a case “has\n\nthe burden of establishing three elements: (1) the detainee had a ‘particular vulnerability\n\n       2\n          The District Court dismissed the parents’ Corrected First Amended Complaint on\nprocedural and substantive grounds. That pleading had been filed simply to correct an oversight\nin the drafting of the caption and liability allegations of the First Amended Complaint - the\nomission of Officer McClellan. The District Court had in any event treated McClellan as a party\nto the proceedings and had previously dismissed the action against him.\n\n                                               8\n\fto suicide’ (2) the custodial officer or officers knew or should have known of that\n\nvulnerability, and (3) those officers ‘acted with reckless indifference’ to the detainee’s\n\nparticular vulnerability.” Id. at 1023.\n\n       The District Court held that as to each prison official the Amended Complaint\n\n“suffers from the same defects as the original complaint. It contains boilerplate,\n\nconclusory language which we are not obliged to accept as true. The principal example\n\nof this conclusory language is that [the Defendants] ‘knew or should have known that\n\nKulp had a particular vulnerability to suicide and acted with deliberate indifference.’”\n\n(A. 62a, A. 72a).\n\n       Referring to the information each Prison employee is alleged to have received and\n\nto the action or inaction attributed to each of them, the Court concluded that those\n\nallegations were insufficient to permit the case to proceed:\n\n\n\n              As we observed in prior orders, the requirement of a particular vulnerability\n              to suicide requires that there be a strong likelihood of self-inflicted harm\n              rather than a mere possibility. Nothing alleged in the amended complaint\n              suggests a strong likelihood of suicide. Moreover, there are no allegations\n              in the amended complaint from which it could be concluded that\n              Defendants were deliberately indifferent. Indeed the factual allegations set\n              forth in the amended complaint reveal efforts by Defendants to provide\n              Kulp with care.\n\n(A. 63a, A. 72A-73a).\n\n       Colburn II, upon which the District Court relied, was in a different procedural\n\nposture from the present case. It concerned the granting of a summary judgment after full\n\n\n                                              9\n\fdiscovery had been taken. The present case is akin to Colburn I.\n\n       In Colburn I, the original complaint alleged in general terms that defendants knew,\n\nor should have known, that the detainee in question was a suicide risk. We observed that\n\n“[w]hile this allegation standing alone may not have met this court’s standard for a\n\nmodicum of factual specificity in civil rights complaints, plaintiff, in her memorandum in\n\nopposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss in the district court, buttressed her complaint\n\nallegation with [a number of facts] which could be asserted in an amended complaint.”\n\nColburn I at 670. The opinion listed the facts.\n\n       Like the complaint in Colburn I, as supplemented by the memorandum, the\n\nAmended Complaint in this case contains numerous facts which, when viewed in their\n\ntotality and supplemented by information obtained in discovery, might support an\n\ninference of liability on the part of some or all of the Prison employees. It is premature to\n\ndecide at this stage of the proceeding the full extent of each person’s knowledge and the\n\nentirety of his or her actions. As we stated in Colburn I, “[p]laintiff is therefore entitled\n\nto a reasonable amount of discovery to help her make the necessary showing to prove her\n\ncase.” Id. at 670.\n\n       The District Court here held the parents to a higher standard of pleading than is\n\nrequired. As we have stated:\n\n              The Defendants likewise argue on appeal that Alston’s complaint lacked\n              sufficient factual support. But a plaintiff need not plead facts. To\n              withstand a 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff need only make out a claim upon\n              which relief can be granted. If more facts are necessary to resolve or clarify\n              the disputed issues, the parties may avail themselves of the civil discovery\n\n                                              10\n\f              mechanisms under the Federal Rules.\n                                            …\n\n              The need for discovery before testing a complaint for factual sufficiency is\n              particularly acute for civil rights plaintiffs, who often face informational\n              disadvantages.\n                                            …\n\n              Because Alston’s complaint was dismissed before an opportunity for\n              discovery, any expectation of factual sufficiency was premature. It is a first\n              principle of federal civil procedure that litigants “are entitled to discovery\n              before being put to their proof.” Bennett v. Schmidt, 153 F.3d 516, 519 (7th\n              Cir. 1998).\n\n\nAlston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 233 n.6 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n       In the present case, the parents’ Complaint was dismissed before they had an\n\nopportunity for discovery, and “any expectation of factual sufficiency was premature.” It\n\nwas error to dismiss the Complaint at that stage of the proceeding.\n\n\n\n                                      V. Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the District Court and\n\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f",

Kulp1 and Carol L. Kulp, are the parents of Timothy M.\n\nKulp, (“Kulp”) who committed suicide while incarcerated at the Centre County Prison\n\n(the “Prison”) in Pennsylvania. The parents commenced an action in the District Court\n\nagainst the appellees, employees of the Prison, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state\n\nlaw. They appeal from orders of the District Court dismissing their First Amended\n\nComplaint (the “Complaint”) pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\n\nclaim. We will reverse.\n\n                                         I. Background\n\n        The Complaint named ten persons as defendants in their individual and official\n\ncapacities. Because the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss under\n\nRule 12(b)(6), we take the factual background of this case from the Complaint and accept\n\nall allegations contained therein as true.

Debevoise, Senior District Court Judge for the District of New\nJersey, sitting by designation.\n        1\n            Timothy D. Kulp appeals individually and as administrator of the estate of Timothy M.\nKulp.\n\n                                                 2\n\fCir. 1994).\n\n       Lieutenants Sonia Veruette and Smith were responsible for implementing\n\nappropriate policies of the Prison, supervising its staff and pretrial detainees, and\n\nestablishing suicide watch and appropriate observation of pretrial detainees. Shannon\n\nQuick and Timothy Gallu were counseling or healthcare employees at the Prison.\n\nCorrectional Officers Knepp, McClellan, Andrews, Shearer, Gates and Stefanko had\n\nresponsibility for executing appropriate policies and procedures at the Prison, supervising\n\npretrial detainees and, among other duties, implementing suicide watch and appropriate\n\nobservation and handling pretrial detainees requiring suicide watch.\n\n       On or about 2:20 a.m. on August 26, 2001, eighteen year old Kulp was committed\n\nto the Prison as a pretrial detainee on charges of burglary, criminal attempt at burglary,\n\ncriminal trespass, misdemeanor indecent assault and summary harassment. The\n\ncommitment documentation, consisting of a Police Criminal Complaint and Affidavit of\n\nProbable Cause, reflected that Kulp, while drunk and after smoking marijuana, entered,\n\nwithout the consent or knowledge of the occupants, the dormitory rooms of at least three\n\nsleeping Penn State female students, lay next to them, and indecently fondled them during\n\nthe early morning hours of August 25.\n\n       During Kulp’s commitment, Officer McClellan noted that he had alcohol addiction\n\nand mental illness, and that he was cooperative but upset. Officer Knepp conducted a\n\nsuicide prevention screening at about 2:30 a.m. He knew or should have known of the\n\ncommitment documentation and the Inmate Commitment Summary Report. Officer\n\n                                              3\n\fKnepp noted on Kulp’s Suicide Prevention Screening Questionnaire that Kulp was\n\nworried about his current situation, but, contrary to all the documentation previously\n\nreferred to, incorrectly noted on the Questionnaire that Kulp did not have a psychiatric\n\nhistory or take psychiatric medication, that his alleged crime was not shocking in nature,\n\nand that Kulp did not show signs of depression or appear anxious, afraid, angry,\n\nembarrassed, or ashamed. Officer Knepp reported on the Questionnaire that he did not\n\nnotify the Shift Commander or refer Kulp to Mental Health. As a result of the\n\nQuestionnaire Kulp was assigned to an initial 48 hours administrative segregation under\n\nregular supervision.\n\n       Officer Knepp failed to complete the Questionnaire accurately and failed to notify\n\nthe Shift Commander of Kulp’s condition. He failed to refer Kulp to Mental Health and\n\nfailed to take steps to obtain a mental health examination or further health treatment. He\n\ndid not have Kulp placed on a suicide watch, and he did not have Kulp appropriately\n\nobserved, nor did he remove from Kulp’s possession items that could be used in a suicide\n\nattempt.\n\n       At about 7:52 a.m. on August 26, Quick, the counselor and healthcare employee,\n\nexamined Kulp. She knew or should have known the contents of all the foregoing\n\ndocumentation. Kulp informed Quick that his motive for the charged crimes was that he\n\nwanted to wake up next to another person, implying loneliness, depression, and/or\n\nanother vulnerable emotional or mental state.\n\n       Quick noted in her Consultation Record that Kulp: (a) was depressed, labile,\n\n                                             4\n\ftearful, confused and anxious; (b) expressed problems with his family and suffered from\n\nalcohol and marijuana abuse; (c) had relationship issues and mood swings with impulsive\n\nbehavior; (d) had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but declined to take his\n\nmedication; (e) was having passive suicidal thought in the form of believing that things\n\ncould not get worse; and (f) was very anxious about his arrest and related his current\n\nsituation to family and friends. Quick further noted that, although she did not believe\n\nKulp appeared to pose a threat to himself at that time, he had the potential to\n\ndecompensate rapidly. Quick recommended that Kulp see a counselor, be placed in a cell\n\nby the guards, and be under observation. She failed specifically to request that Kulp be\n\nplaced on a suicide watch and failed to report his vulnerability so that it could be properly\n\nacted upon. She failed to have Kulp appropriately observed, and she did not have\n\nremoved from Kulp’s possession items that could be used in a suicide attempt.\n\n       Lieutenant Smith, who knew or should have known of all of the previously\n\nmentioned documentation, noted at about 7:52 a.m. on August 26, 2001, that Quick had\n\nreported that Kulp was not a threat to himself at that time, that Kulp should see a prison\n\ncounselor the next day and that an eye should be kept on Kulp. Knowing of Kulp’s\n\nvulnerability to suicide from the above documentation, Lieutenant Smith nevertheless\n\nfailed to have Kulp placed on suicide watch, or to have Kulp appropriately observed. He\n\nfailed to remove from Kulp’s possession items which could be used in a suicide attempt.\n\n       Lt. Veruette had the responsibility of assigning Kulp’s cell and observation status.\n\nShe knew, or should have known, on the basis of the contents of the aforementioned\n\n                                              5\n\fdocumentation, that Kulp had a particular vulnerability to suicide and should be kept\n\nunder observation. She assigned Kulp to Cell No. THU1, failing to have Kulp placed on\n\nsuicide watch or appropriately observed. She failed to have removed from Kulp’s\n\npossession items that could be used in a suicide attempt.\n\n       Gallu, a prison counsel, examined Kulp at 3:30 p.m. on August 26. He knew or\n\nshould have known of the previously mentioned documentation. He reported about his\n\nconsultation after Kulp committed suicide, stating that “(a) Kulp was quiet and polite; (b)\n\nthey discussed Kulp’s family and mental health history; (c) Kulp informed Defendant\n\nGallu of his bipolarism and refusal to take his medication; (d) Defendant Gallu told Kulp\n\nthat he would like to refer him to the MH/MR Unit of Centre County so that he could be\n\nevaluated and possibly set up with a psychiatrist, urged Kulp to take his medication, and\n\nstated that now might be a good time to get help. Kulp agreed and said he would meet\n\nwith a Mental Health Liaison. When asked if he were suicidal or had a history of suicide,\n\nKulp replied in the negative.” (Complaint, para. 32.)\n\n       Based upon his observations and the various reports, Gallu knew, or should have\n\nknown, that Kulp had a particular vulnerability to suicide. Nevertheless, he failed to take\n\nappropriate action. Instead he wrote that Kulp gave no indication of a desire to harm\n\nhimself and reported that information to a Deputy Warden of the prison.\n\n       Kulp received no further counseling or mental health examination or treatment.\n\nHe was not placed in a suicide watch, nor were items which could be used in a suicide\n\nattempt taken from him.\n\n                                             6\n\f       On August 27, 2001, at about 10:30 p.m., Lieutenant Veruette and Officers\n\nMcClellan, Andrews, Shearer, Gates and Stefanko were on duty at the prison. Officers\n\nMcClellan, Andrews and Shearer conducted a routine watch tour of the prison housing\n\nareas and observed Kulp sitting on his bed. All of these officers knew, or reasonably\n\nshould have known, that they were to keep Kulp under observation as a potential suicide\n\nrisk but failed to do so. They also failed to remove from him items which he could use in\n\ncommitting suicide. At approximately 11:06 p.m., when he could not see Kulp from the\n\nmain door of the THU housing area, McClellan entered the housing area and found Kulp\n\nhanging by a shoelace around his neck.\n\n       In addition to alleging these facts, the Complaint alleged generally that each prison\n\nemployee acted with deliberate indifference to Kulp’s vulnerability to suicide, and that\n\ntheir actions and inactions caused Kulp’s death in violation of his right to life, liberty and\n\nproperty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n                           II. The District Court Proceedings\n\n       The Prison employees filed three motions to dismiss the original complaint. The\n\nDistrict Court granted each of the motions without prejudice to the right of the parents to\n\nfile an amended complaint. The parents filed their First Amended Complaint (the\n\nComplaint), which dropped a number of defendants but changed little else of substance.\n\nThereupon Quick moved to dismiss the Complaint, and subsequently the other Prison\n\nemployees did likewise. The District Court granted the motions, dismissing the federal\n\nclaims with prejudice and dismissing the state law claims without prejudice to the\n\n                                              7\n\fparents’ right to pursue those claims in the State Court.”2 This appeal followed.\n\n                        III. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n       The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. We\n\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We have plenary review over a district\n\ncourt’s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and we review the District\n\nCourt’s decision de novo, applying the same legal standard as the trial court to the same\n\nrecord.

Discussion\n\n       The District Court fully recognized the limited circumstances in which a motion to\n\ndismiss a complaint can be granted and emphasized the heavy burden a plaintiff carries in\n\na prison suicide case brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Colburn v. Upper Darby\n\nTownship, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570030\"><a href=\"/opinion/570030/colburn-sue-ann-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-melinda-lee-stierheim/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1991) (Colburn II). The plaintiff in such a case “has\n\nthe burden of establishing three elements: (1) the detainee had a ‘particular vulnerability\n\n       2\n          The District Court dismissed the parents’ Corrected First Amended Complaint on\nprocedural and substantive grounds. That pleading had been filed simply to correct an oversight\nin the drafting of the caption and liability allegations of the First Amended Complaint - the\nomission of Officer McClellan. The District Court had in any event treated McClellan as a party\nto the proceedings and had previously dismissed the action against him.\n\n                                               8\n\fto suicide’ (2) the custodial officer or officers knew or should have known of that\n\nvulnerability, and (3) those officers ‘acted with reckless indifference’ to the detainee’s\n\nparticular vulnerability.” Id. at 1023.\n\n       The District Court held that as to each prison official the Amended Complaint\n\n“suffers from the same defects as the original complaint. It contains boilerplate,\n\nconclusory language which we are not obliged to accept as true. The principal example\n\nof this conclusory language is that [the Defendants] ‘knew or should have known that\n\nKulp had a particular vulnerability to suicide and acted with deliberate indifference.’”\n\n(A. 62a, A. 72a).\n\n       Referring to the information each Prison employee is alleged to have received and\n\nto the action or inaction attributed to each of them, the Court concluded that those\n\nallegations were insufficient to permit the case to proceed:\n\n\n\n              As we observed in prior orders, the requirement of a particular vulnerability\n              to suicide requires that there be a strong likelihood of self-inflicted harm\n              rather than a mere possibility. Nothing alleged in the amended complaint\n              suggests a strong likelihood of suicide. Moreover, there are no allegations\n              in the amended complaint from which it could be concluded that\n              Defendants were deliberately indifferent. Indeed the factual allegations set\n              forth in the amended complaint reveal efforts by Defendants to provide\n              Kulp with care.\n\n(A. 63a, A. 72A-73a).\n\n       Colburn II, upon which the District Court relied, was in a different procedural\n\nposture from the present case. It concerned the granting of a summary judgment after full\n\n\n                                              9\n\fdiscovery had been taken. The present case is akin to Colburn I.\n\n       In Colburn I, the original complaint alleged in general terms that defendants knew,\n\nor should have known, that the detainee in question was a suicide risk. We observed that\n\n“[w]hile this allegation standing alone may not have met this court’s standard for a\n\nmodicum of factual specificity in civil rights complaints, plaintiff, in her memorandum in\n\nopposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss in the district court, buttressed her complaint\n\nallegation with [a number of facts] which could be asserted in an amended complaint.”\n\nColburn I at 670. The opinion listed the facts.\n\n       Like the complaint in Colburn I, as supplemented by the memorandum, the\n\nAmended Complaint in this case contains numerous facts which, when viewed in their\n\ntotality and supplemented by information obtained in discovery, might support an\n\ninference of liability on the part of some or all of the Prison employees. It is premature to\n\ndecide at this stage of the proceeding the full extent of each person’s knowledge and the\n\nentirety of his or her actions. As we stated in Colburn I, “[p]laintiff is therefore entitled\n\nto a reasonable amount of discovery to help her make the necessary showing to prove her\n\ncase.” Id. at 670.\n\n       The District Court here held the parents to a higher standard of pleading than is\n\nrequired. As we have stated:\n\n              The Defendants likewise argue on appeal that Alston’s complaint lacked\n              sufficient factual support. But a plaintiff need not plead facts. To\n              withstand a 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff need only make out a claim upon\n              which relief can be granted. If more facts are necessary to resolve or clarify\n              the disputed issues, the parties may avail themselves of the civil discovery\n\n                                              10\n\f              mechanisms under the Federal Rules.\n                                            …\n\n              The need for discovery before testing a complaint for factual sufficiency is\n              particularly acute for civil rights plaintiffs, who often face informational\n              disadvantages.\n                                            …\n\n              Because Alston’s complaint was dismissed before an opportunity for\n              discovery, any expectation of factual sufficiency was premature. It is a first\n              principle of federal civil procedure that litigants “are entitled to discovery\n              before being put to their proof.” Bennett v.
