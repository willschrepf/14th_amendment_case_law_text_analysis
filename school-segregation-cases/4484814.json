For over 30 years, Bar’s Products (Bars) and Bars Products\n\nInternational (BPI) shared the worldwide market for “Bar’s Leaks” brand automotive supplies.\n\nBars sold in the United States and Canada; BPI sold internationally. This relationship soured in\n\n2007 when Bars started selling products abroad under a different brand name, and BPI responded\n\nby promoting its products at a Las Vegas trade show. Bars sued BPI, alleging trademark\n\ninfringement and unfair competition; BPI countered with breach-of-contract and unfair-\n\ncompetition claims. The district court dismissed all of Bars’s claims but allowed a jury to\n\nconsider BPI’s counterclaims. The jury awarded BPI $1,560,195 for breach of contract and\n\n$974,849 for unfair competition. On appeal, Bars argues that the district court erred in denying\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nits motion for judgment as a matter of law on both of BPI’s counterclaims and by refusing to\n\ngrant Bars leave to amend its trademark claim. We AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       In 1947, Fred Barton developed a radiator stop-leak product and later established Bars to\n\nmarket it. Barton protected his invention through patents and trademarks, holding some in his\n\nindividual capacity and others through Bars or Barton’s wholly-owned company, Huki Lau.\n\nOver the next two decades, Barton built an international distribution chain by selling raw\n\nmaterials to companies licensed to produce and sell Bars’s signature brand of “Bar’s Leaks”\n\nproducts.\n\n       BPI began as one of Bars’s foreign licensees. In 1973, Barton, Huki Lau, and Bars\n\nexecuted a series of agreements to “sell, assign and transfer” to BPI “all foreign business in any\n\nand all countries foreign to the United States except Canada including all right, title and interest\n\nin any and all . . . foreign inventions, patents, trademarks . . . together with the good will of the\n\nforeign business.” Bars was a party to only one of those agreements; Barton or Huki Lau\n\nexecuted the rest in their own names.\n\n       Through these agreements, BPI gained control over the foreign distribution of Bar’s\n\nLeaks products outside of Canada. For the next 30 years Bars and BPI maintained a harmonious\n\nbusiness relationship. Bars sold BPI the raw ingredients to make Bar’s Leaks products and\n\nneither party encroached on the other’s territory. The two companies also shared a booth for\n\nmany years at the Automotive Aftermarket Products Expo (AAPEX) in Las Vegas, with BPI\n\nattending as Bars’s guest. At these conventions, Bars referred international buyers to BPI.\n\n       This relationship deteriorated in the early 2000s when Bars increased the price of raw\n\nmaterials and proposed to purchase back all of BPI’s assets and goodwill. When BPI refused,\n\n                                                -2-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nBars demanded a two-month lead time on all orders, which, when combined with the price\n\nincrease, prompted BPI to open its own plant to manufacture the ingredients necessary to\n\nproduce Bar’s Leaks products. Bars later purchased the rights to the “Rislone” brand and began\n\nselling automotive products internationally under that label in 2007. At trial, Bars’s President\n\nadmitted that some Rislone products it sold abroad were the “same thing” as what Bars sold\n\ndomestically. Moreover, some of those products referenced “Bar’s Leaks” or “Bar’s Products”\n\non their labels. This marked the first time Bars sold products outside the United States without\n\nBPI’s blessing.\n\n       BPI attended the Las Vegas products expo with its own independent booth for the first\n\ntime in 2010. Displeased, Bars filed the present lawsuit, asserting trademark infringement and\n\nunfair competition.     BPI counterclaimed for breach of contract and unfair competition,\n\nmaintaining that Bars breached the 1973 agreements by selling automotive products abroad.\n\n       The district court dismissed Bars’s trademark claim and refused leave to amend.\n\nFollowing three-and-a-half years of motion practice, Bars and BPI finally tried the case before a\n\njury. At the close of evidence, BPI moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on Bars’s remaining claims, which the court granted, and Bars does\n\nnot appeal. The district court denied Bars’s Rule 50 motion on BPI’s breach-of-contract and\n\nunfair-competition counterclaims.      The jury then returned a verdict for BPI on both\n\ncounterclaims and awarded it $1,560,195 in breach-of-contract damages and $974,849 as\n\ndamages for unfair competition. After the verdict, Bars renewed its motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law, or in the alternative for a new trial or remittitur, which the district court denied.\n\nBars appeals, taking issue with the district court’s denial of its Rule 50 motions and the court’s\n\nrefusal to grant it leave to amend its trademark claim.\n\n                                                -3-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n                                                II.\n\nA. Breach of Contract\n\n       Bars first argues that the district court should have granted its renewed motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on BPI’s breach-of-contract counterclaim. We review this decision\n\nde novo. Barnes v. City of Cincinnati, 401 F.3d 729, 736 (6th Cir. 2005). Judgment as a matter\n\nof law is appropriate only when, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party, “there is a complete absence of fact to support the verdict, so that no reasonable\n\njuror could have found for the nonmoving party.” Kiphart v. Saturn Corp., 251 F.3d 573, 581\n\n(6th Cir. 2001) (quoting Moore v. KUKA Welding Sys. & Robot Corp., 171 F.3d 1073, 1078 (6th\n\nCir. 1999)). Michigan law governs the substance of BPI’s breach-of-contract claim. See Wells\n\nv. 10-X Mfg. Co., 609 F.2d 248, 253 (6th Cir. 1979).\n\n       The district court denied Bars’s renewed motion because it concluded that sufficient\n\nevidence supported: (1) the existence of an enforceable contract; and (2) that Bars breached that\n\ncontract. We agree.\n\n       1. Scope of the 1973 Agreements\n\n       Bars argues that the district court erred by allowing the jury to consider all the 1973\n\ntransferring assignments as part of the “contract” that obligated Bars, even though Barton and\n\nHuki Lau, not Bars, signed many of those assignments. At trial and on appeal, Bars maintains it\n\nshould be bound only by the single agreement it signed.\n\n       The parol evidence rule forbids the introduction of evidence of prior or contemporaneous\n\nagreements to vary the terms of a written instrument that purports to be the “final expression of\n\n[the parties’] agreement.” Mich. Comp. Laws § 440.2202; United Precision Prods. Co. v. Avco\n\nCorp., 540 F. App’x 489, 493 (6th Cir. 2013) (applying Michigan law). But absent a finding that\n\n                                               -4-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nthe parties intended the document to represent the complete and final embodiment of their\n\nagreement, courts admit extrinsic evidence to explain the parties’ intent. See NAG Enters., Inc.\n\nv. All State Indus., Inc., 285 N.W.2d 770, 771 (Mich. 1979) (per curiam). And “[e]xtrinsic\n\nevidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations is admissible as it bears on this\n\nthreshold question of whether the written instrument is [the complete agreement between the\n\nparties].” Id.\n\n       Nothing in the single agreement Bars signed identifies the writing as the “final\n\nexpression” of the parties’ agreement. All the extrinsic evidence points in the other direction.\n\nBarton founded Bars and served as its president and majority shareholder for over 20 years until\n\njust before he made the assignments at issue. Barton also owned Huki Lau, which shared an\n\naddress with Bars in 1973. And during the period leading up to the 1973 agreements, Bars,\n\nBarton, and Huki Lau operated as a single entity: Bars sold product through license agreements\n\nthat Barton held in his individual capacity, using intellectual property that Barton or Huki Lau\n\nowned. A 1973 letter from Bars’s counsel to BPI—written after Barton sold his shares in Bars—\n\nacknowledges this reality. The letter references “proper Assignments from Frederic D. Barton,\n\nHuki Lau Inc. and [Bars] to [BPI],” and confirms that “[t]hese assignments are perfect and\n\neverything now appears to be in order for commencing transfer of all rights to [BPI].”\n\n       Despite all this, Bars claims that “BPI failed to submit any evidence that Barton had the\n\nauthority to enter into agreements on behalf of Bars.” Yet, as the district court noted, none of the\n\nsignatories testified at trial, meaning that BPI needed to rely on circumstantial evidence to show\n\nthat Bars intended to be bound by the Barton and Huki Lau assignments. That evidence strongly\n\nsuggests that the 1973 agreements were a package deal.\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       2. Breach\n\n       Bars argues that even considering all the agreements as a single contract, BPI produced\n\nno evidence of breach. At trial, BPI argued that Bars breached the contract by: (1) applying for\n\nforeign trademark registrations in countries where BPI owned the relevant trademarks; (2) selling\n\nproducts with the “Bar’s Leaks” trademark outside the U.S. and Canada; and (3) selling products\n\nunder the “Rislone” brand to customers outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\n       The jury awarded BPI $1,537,659 in damages for “sales of items other than Bar’s Leaks\n\noutside the United States and Canada.” This could only mean Rislone and the raw materials\n\nused to make Rislone, because those are the only products “other than Bar’s Leaks” that Bars\n\nsells. Yet Bars reasons that because it did not own Rislone in 1973, selling Rislone could only\n\nconstitute breach if the 1973 agreements include a non-compete provision or non-solicitation\n\ncovenant. Bars insists that BPI failed to establish either.\n\n       BPI disclaims ever arguing that the 1973 agreements contain a non-compete provision or\n\nimplied non-solicitation covenant. BPI maintains that it purchased “the exclusive rights to sell\n\nthe Bars’ product line in all countries (outside of the U.S. and Canada),” and Bars breached by\n\nselling automotive products abroad, whether labeled as “Bar’s Leaks” or “Rislone,” and\n\nregardless of whether those products existed in 1973.\n\n       The district court instructed the jury that it could construe the contract as including either\n\nan agreement that limits competition or an implied non-solicitation covenant. The general\n\nverdict form, however, asked only whether “Bars breached an enforceable contract.”\n\n       “When one of several claims submitted to the jury should not have been submitted,\n\n‘a general verdict . . . cannot stand.’” Doherty v. Am. Motors Corp., 728 F.2d 334, 344 (6th Cir.\n\n1984) (quoting Morrissey v. Nat’l Maritime Union of Am., 544 F.2d 19, 26 (2d Cir. 1976)).\n\n                                                -6-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nOtherwise “[t]here is no way to know that the invalid claim . . . was not the sole basis for the\n\nverdict.” Id. (quoting United Pilots Ass’n v. Halecki, 358 U.S. 613, 619 (1959)). Accordingly,\n\nBars is correct that if the district court erred in submitting to the jury either a non-competition or\n\nnon-solicitation theory of liability, a new trial is warranted.        See, e.g., Loesel v. City of\n\nFrankenmuth, 692 F.3d 452, 467–68 (6th Cir. 2012) (ordering a new trial where the jury\n\ninstructions presented alternative theories of liability, one of which was not properly submitted,\n\nand the jury returned a general verdict in favor of plaintiff); Virtual Maint., Inc. v. Prime\n\nComput., Inc., 11 F.3d 660, 667 (6th Cir. 1993) (same). We consider each theory in turn and\n\nconclude that the district court committed no error.\n\n               a. Non-Competition Theory\n\n       Bars argues that in the absence of a non-compete provision in the 1973 agreements, BPI\n\ncould have no tenable claim. According to Bars, non-compete agreements must be “expressly\n\nreserved in a contract,” and because the 1973 assignments did not do so, the district court ought\n\nto have ruled in favor of Bars on BPI’s non-competition theory of breach.\n\n       Before addressing the merits, BPI suggests that Bars waived this argument by failing to\n\nobject to the jury instructions. But because Bars argued that the agreements lack a non-compete\n\nagreement in multiple motions before the district court—including in its motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law before the court gave the pertinent instructions—Bars preserved this argument\n\nfor appeal. See K&T Enters., Inc. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 97 F.3d 171, 174–75 (6th Cir. 1996).\n\n       By framing our interpretative task narrowly—does the contract include an express non-\n\ncompetition provision—Bars invites the answer: clearly not. That, says BPI, is not the right\n\nquestion: The jury was not asked to find an express non-competition provision in the contract.\n\nThe district court instructed the jury that it could find the parties to have “entered into an\n\n                                                -7-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nagreement that limit[s] competition.” The question then becomes: could the jury have construed\n\nthe contract in a way that “limits competition.”\n\n       Contract interpretation is generally a question of law but becomes a question of fact if the\n\ncontract language is ambiguous. Klapp v. United Ins. Grp. Agency, 663 N.W.2d 447, 453–54\n\n(Mich. 2003) (citing Hewett Grocery Co. v. Biddle Purchasing Co., 286 N.W. 221 (Mich.\n\n1939)). The initial ambiguity determination is a question of law that we review de novo. Id. at\n\n451 (citing Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Nikkel, 596 N.W.2d 915 (Mich. 1999)). A contract is\n\nambiguous “if the language is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.” City of\n\nWyandotte v. Consol. Rail Corp., 262 F.3d 581, 585 (6th Cir. 2001) (quoting D’Avanzo v. Wise\n\n& Marsac, P.C., 565 N.W.2d 915, 918 (Mich. Ct. App. 1997)). Only if the trial court finds\n\ntextual ambiguity should it allow the fact-finder to consider extrinsic evidence such as the “the\n\nparties’ conduct, the statements of its representatives, and past practice.” Klapp, 663 N.W.2d at\n\n454 (quoting Penzien v. Dielectric Prods. Eng’g Co., 132 N.W.2d 130, 132 (Mich. 1965)).\n\n       At the outset, Bars faults the district court for allowing course-of-conduct evidence\n\nbefore finding the agreements ambiguous. The district court did err in this regard: the court\n\ninstructed the jury that it could “consider the conduct of the parties” only if it “find[s] the\n\ncontract is ambiguous.” Although the court’s instruction correctly states the trigger for allowing\n\nextrinsic evidence, it gets the actor wrong: the judge, not the jury, should make a finding of\n\nambiguity. See, e.g., Klapp, 663 N.W.2d at 451, 454. Nonetheless, “we will not set aside a jury\n\nverdict on the basis of a technically faulty jury instruction when the error is harmless.”\n\nBridgeport Music, Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc., 585 F.3d 267, 274 (6th Cir. 2009) (citing\n\nBarnes v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 201 F.3d 815, 822 (6th Cir. 2000)).\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       The 1973 agreements are “susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations,” and\n\ntherefore ambiguous. City of Wyandotte, 262 F.3d at 585 (quoting D’Avanzo, 565 N.W.2d at\n\n918). The 1973 agreements all include similar language transferring to BPI “all foreign business\n\nin any and all countries foreign to the United States except Canada, including all right . . . in any\n\nand all such [intellectual property] . . . including but not being limited to” specified foreign\n\ntrademarks, as “fully and entirely as the same would have been held by [Bars] had this\n\nassignment and sale not been made.” The agreements describe the business sold as “radiator and\n\ncooling system products.”\n\n       This language could reasonably be read to transfer not only the foreign rights in Bars’s\n\nautomotive and radiator cooling products circa 1973, but also the right to market Bars’s future\n\nproduct line of radiator and cooling products. The words “including but not being limited to”\n\nand “any and all foreign countries” clearly contemplate the transfer of intellectual property other\n\nthan what is described in the contract, making the transfer of associated future business a\n\nreasonable contract interpretation.\n\n       Bars resists a finding of ambiguity by focusing on the way the contracts describe the\n\n“foreign business” BPI sought to buy. All the 1973 agreements explain that Bars “is doing\n\nbusiness pertaining to radiator and cooling system products” and specify that BPI “is desirous of\n\nacquiring such business in all countries foreign to the United States except Canada.” According\n\nto Bars, the use of the present-tense verb “is” makes clear that the parties intended to transfer\n\nonly Bars’s foreign business and intellectual property as of 1973.\n\n       Bars’s argument has force, but the use of the present-tense verb does not bear the\n\ncontrolling weight that Bars assigns to it. “[L]egal drafters frequently use the present tense to\n\ncover the present and the future.” Multimatic, Inc. v. Faurecia Int. Sys. USA, Inc., 358 F. App’x\n\n                                                -9-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n643, 647 (6th Cir. 2009); see also In re Stratford of Tex., Inc., 635 F.2d 365, 369 (5th Cir. 1981)\n\n(“[T]he present tense of a verb may sometimes refer to the past and to the future as well as to the\n\npresent . . . [,] [f]urthermore, the present tense may be used when the time is actually indefinite.”\n\n(internal citation omitted)). And here, the use of the present-tense does little to resolve the\n\nambiguity present in the contract as a whole. First, that Bars would describe the nature of its\n\nbusiness in the present tense is unremarkable. Second, while one of the 1973 agreements\n\ntransfers “such foreign business,” clearly referencing the preamble, the others transfer “all\n\nforeign business,” without referring to the business that Bars “is doing.” Third, the contracts\n\ntransfer “all foreign business in any and all countries foreign to the United States . . . including\n\nbut not being limited to” the business associated with Bars’s existing intellectual property. Had\n\nthe parties intended to transfer only the business associated with Bars’s intellectual property\n\ncirca 1973, the language “any and all” and “including but not being limited to” would be\n\nredundant.\n\n       Because we find the 1973 agreements ambiguous, only harmless error resulted from\n\nletting the jury determine ambiguity. And given this ambiguity, the jury could properly consider\n\nextrinsic evidence to discern the parties’ intent. At trial, BPI found support for its reading of the\n\n1973 agreements in the parties’ course of conduct. First, Bars sent BPI a letter shortly after all\n\nthe agreements were executed stating that “[t]hese assignments are perfect and everything now\n\nappears to be in order for commencing transfer of all rights to [BPI].” Second, Bars sold no\n\nproducts outside the United States, Canada, or Mexico for over thirty years between 1973 and\n\n2007, and instead treated BPI as its exclusive international partner even as BPI’s presence\n\nexpanded beyond the markets that Bars serviced in 1973. Third, when Bars wanted to sell\n\nproducts in Mexico in 1998, it sought and obtained a license from BPI in exchange for the\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\npayment of licensing fees. From this conduct a reasonable juror could find that Bars granted BPI\n\nthe exclusive right to sell its current and future products abroad.\n\n               b. Implied Non-Solicitation Theory\n\n       Bars next argues that no reasonable juror could have found a breach of the implied non-\n\nsolicitation covenant.     “[U]nder Michigan law, the sale of a business along with its\n\naccompanying good will gives rise to a covenant precluding the seller from soliciting back to\n\nhimself that which he has sold.” Worgess Agency, Inc. v. Lane, 239 N.W.2d 417, 421 (Mich. Ct.\n\nApp. 1976).     Bars maintains that Michigan law requires proving solicitation of a “former\n\ncustomer,” and asserts that its only international customers in 1973 were the eight foreign\n\ndistributors to whom it sold raw materials. Because the jury heard no evidence that it solicited\n\none of those customers, Bars concludes that it could not have breached the implied covenant.\n\n       Bars’s argument is flawed in several respects. To begin, Bars cites no case that would\n\nrequire the district court (or this court) to find that Bars’s only customers as of 1973 were its\n\nforeign distributors. That Bars only sold through distributors does not mean that end-users are\n\nnot its customers as a matter of law. Many companies make products intended for mass\n\nconsumption but choose to sell through distributors. The implied covenant would be toothless if\n\nsuch a company could sell its entire business and goodwill, and then turn around and set up an\n\nidentical business so long as it reaches consumers through a different distribution chain. See\n\nGetter v. Levine, 24 N.W.2d 149, 152 (Mich. 1946) (noting seller of a business and its goodwill\n\nmay not start a new business and “represent the new business as a continuation of the old”);\n\nColton v. Duvall, 237 N.W. 48, 50 (Mich. 1931) (explaining that seller is “not at liberty to\n\ndestroy what he transferred or depreciate what he sold”).\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n        Bars’s argument that BPI was required to show solicitation of one of the 1973 distributors\n\nalso assumes that the 1973 agreements transferred only Bars’s then-existing foreign business.\n\nAs discussed above, however, the jury could construe the contract to transfer to BPI all foreign\n\nbusiness in radiator and cooling products, not just the business Bars was doing in 1973. And\n\nbecause the core of a Worgess claim is “soliciting back . . . that which [is] sold,” Worgess,\n\n239 N.W.2d at 421, this distinction matters. As the jury heard, Bars sold automotive products\n\nabroad under the Rislone brand, many of which were similar to or the same as products that BPI\n\nsold as “Bar’s Leaks.” The jury also heard evidence that, in some cases, Bars simply placed a\n\nRislone sticker over “Bar’s Leaks” products and displayed them at international trade shows.\n\nMoreover, some of the Rislone products sold abroad referenced “Bar’s Leaks” or “Bar’s\n\nProducts” on their labels. A reasonable juror could conclude that Bars “solicited back” the\n\nforeign business that it sold by selling substantially the same products under the Rislone brand\n\nname.\n\n               c. Alleged Scope and Duration Errors\n\n        Bars presents two final arguments—both flawed—for why the district court erred in\n\ndenying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on BPI’s breach-of-contract counterclaim.\n\nBars argues that even if the district court properly submitted the non-compete theory to the jury,\n\nthe court “erred by failing to impose a reasonable scope and duration on the alleged” agreements.\n\nAnd to the extent the jury found breach of a non-solicitation covenant, Bars maintains that any\n\ncovenant lasting decades is not supported by Worgess.\n\n        Bars’s first argument—that a perpetual worldwide non-compete is unreasonable—seems\n\nat first, well, reasonable. No one disputes that “[n]ever is a long time.” Wolverine Sign Works v.\n\nPowers, 227 N.W. 669, 670 (Mich. 1929). But Bars relies heavily on cases analyzing the\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nreasonableness of express non-compete clauses in employment or business-sale contracts. In\n\nsuch cases, the duration and geographic scope are specified, and the court analyzes the express\n\nterms to determine whether they are reasonable in light of any legitimate business interests.\n\nSee, e.g., St. Clair Med., P.C. v. Borgiel, 715 N.W.2d 914, 918–19 (Mich. Ct. App. 2006). BPI’s\n\nargument to the jury, however, was not that the 1973 agreements include an express non-\n\ncompete clause, but rather that Bars sold BPI the exclusive right to sell Bars’s radiator and\n\ncooling products abroad. Cases involving express non-compete clauses therefore provide little\n\ninstruction.\n\n       Even if we entertain Bars’s argument and analyze the 1973 agreements as we would an\n\nexpress non-compete, we would still not fault the district court for denying judgment as a matter\n\nof law. “Agreements not to compete are permissible under Michigan law as long as they are\n\nreasonable.”   Thermatool Corp. v. Borzym, 575 N.W.2d 334, 336 (Mich. Ct. App. 1998).\n\nThough such inquiry is “inherently fact-specific . . . [t]he reasonableness of a noncompete\n\nprovision is a question of law where relevant facts are undisputed.” Certified Restoration Dry\n\nCleaning Network, L.L.C. v. Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d 535, 547 (6th Cir. 2007) (internal citations\n\nand quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). In the business-sale context, “the restraint\n\nmay be as broad as the business covered by the agreement and of sufficient scope to prevent\n\ncompetition therewith.”     Owens v. Hatler, 129 N.W.2d 404, 406 (Mich. 1964); see also\n\nWoodward v. Cadillac Overall Supply Co., 240 N.W.2d 710, 714 (Mich. 1976) (noting that the\n\nreasonableness of non-competition agreements in the employer-employee context is “generally\n\nscrutinized more rigorously than the reasonableness of the covenant not to compete incident to\n\nthe sale of a business”).\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       Because the parties disputed almost every material fact regarding what the 1973\n\nagreements conveyed, the district court properly allowed the jury to decide the reasonableness of\n\nthe contract’s competition-limiting effect. See Certified Restoration, 511 F.3d at 547. Bars sold\n\nBPI “all foreign business in any and all countries foreign to the United States.” Given that a\n\nrestraint in the business-sale context may be “as broad as the business covered by the agreement\n\nand of sufficient scope to prevent competition therewith,” Bars has not convinced us that a\n\nrestraint extending to all foreign countries is unreasonable in these particular circumstances.\n\nOwens, 129 N.W.2d at 406; see also New World Sys. Corp. v. Jones, No. 06-11603, 2009 WL\n\n996954, at *11 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 14, 2009) (a non-competition agreement without any\n\ngeographic limitations “can be reasonable if the employer actually has legitimate business\n\ninterests throughout the world”); ACS Consultant Co. v. Williams, No. 06-11301, 2006 WL\n\n897559, at *7 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 6, 2006) (upholding agreement prohibiting competition in all\n\n50 states because plaintiff serviced all 50 states); Capaldi v. LiftAid Transp., L.L.C., No. 267981,\n\n2006 WL 3019799, at *4 (Mich. Ct. App. Oct. 24, 2006) (per curiam) (“A restriction that is not\n\nlimited in its geographic scope is not necessarily unreasonable.”).\n\n       Bars’s objection to the lack of a time limitation on the implied non-solicitation covenant\n\nis equally unconvincing. Bars latches onto language in Worgess stating that the covenant only\n\nlasts “for a sufficient length of time in order to allow [the buyer] to attract to itself and make its\n\nown that which [the seller] sold.” Worgess, 239 N.W.2d at 422. Bars accuses the district court\n\nof “punt[ing]” on the time-limit issue because it allowed the jury to “basically pick whatever\n\ntime limit it found reasonable.” But Worgess makes clear that the covenant “exists for no set\n\nlength of time,” and “is a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact.” Id. at 422\n\n(emphasis added). The Michigan Court of Appeals emphasized this point repeatedly. Id.\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       Of course, just because an issue is a question of fact does not mean the district court must\n\naccept anything the jury finds. Were we the factfinder, we might agree with Bars that an implied\n\ncovenant expired before Bars began selling Rislone. But respect for Worgess and respect for the\n\njury’s role prevents us from entering judgment as a matter of law unless “no reasonable juror”\n\ncould have found the implied covenant to still be in effect. Kiphart, 251 F.3d at 581 (quoting\n\nMoore, 171 F.3d at 1078). That is a high bar and one that Bars fails to clear.\n\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to BPI, both the non-compete and non-\n\nsolicitation theories submitted to the jury enjoy legal and evidentiary support. We accordingly\n\naffirm the district court’s judgment with respect to BPI’s breach-of-contract counterclaim.\n\nB. Unfair Competition\n\n       Bars next argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on BPI’s unfair-\n\ncompetition counterclaim because the claim relies on the same conduct underlying BPI’s breach-\n\nof-contract counterclaim. In the alternative, Bars asserts that BPI failed to prove damages\n\ncausally connected to any unfair conduct, thereby warranting reversal, remittitur, or a new trial\n\non damages.\n\n       Michigan law prohibits “any conduct that is fraudulent or deceptive and tends to mislead\n\nthe public.” ATCO Indus., Inc. v. Sentek Corp., Nos. 232055, 235398, 2003 WL 21582962, at *3\n\n(Mich. Ct. App. July 10, 2003) (per curiam) (citing Clairol, Inc. v Boston Discount Ctr. of\n\nBerkley, Inc., 608 F.2d 1114, 1120 (6th Cir. 1979)). As a tort, unfair competition requires breach\n\nof a “duty separate and distinct from breach of contract.” Haas v. Montgomery Ward & Co.,\n\n812 F.2d 1015, 1016 (6th Cir. 1987). A plaintiff that establishes unfair competition can recover\n\nonly for the “loss actually sustained by plaintiff as the direct and natural consequence of\n\n[defendant’s unfair] acts.” Liberty Oil Corp. v. Crowley, Milner & Co., 258 N.W. 241, 244\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n(Mich. 1935). “[D]amages which are uncertain or speculative cannot form the basis of recovery.”\n\nId.; see also Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Rosen, 108 F.2d 632, 636 (6th Cir. 1940) (applying\n\nLiberty Oil); Veteran Med. Prods., Inc. v. Bionix Dev. Corp., No. 1:05-cv-655, 2009 WL\n\n891724, at *10–14 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2009) (applying Liberty Oil and reversing verdict\n\nwhere defendant presented “no evidence from which a reasonable jury could begin to determine\n\nany amount of actual damages with reasonable certainty”).\n\n       The jury awarded BPI $974,849 in damages for unfair competition. In opposing Bars’s\n\nrenewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, BPI cited three acts that arguably show breach\n\nof a duty “separate and distinct” from breach of contract. The district court relied on these acts\n\nin denying Bars’s motion. First, the court credited testimony suggesting that Bars registered\n\ntrademarks in foreign countries where BPI owned the relevant marks. Second, the court cited\n\nevidence that Bars attempted to sell raw materials to Sonax—one of BPI’s European licensees—\n\nfor use in “Bar’s Leaks” products, and “conspired with others to sell products [in] countries\n\nwhere BPI held the trademarks of the products.” Third, the court concluded that Bars “may have\n\nattempted to deceive the public or those purchasing the products that [it] had the authority to sell\n\nsuch products outside the United States and Canada.”\n\n       Assuming, without deciding, that these acts constitute unfair competition under Michigan\n\nlaw, BPI failed to prove damages causally connected to that conduct. The district court properly\n\ninstructed the jury that BPI must prove damages “sustained . . . as a result of Bar’s unfair\n\ncompetition.” At trial, however, BPI failed to distinguish between breach-of-contract and unfair-\n\ncompetition damages at all. In fact, BPI did not even attempt to calculate its losses from the\n\nconduct that it claims was unfair. BPI’s damages model calculated lost profits due to Bars’s\n\ninternational sales of Bar’s Leaks, Rislone, and raw materials, but BPI’s position at trial and on\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nappeal is that these sales constitute breach of contract. Indeed, BPI’s damages expert testified\n\nthat his model assumed that Bars’s sale of Bar’s Leaks, Rislone, and raw materials outside the\n\nUnited States or Canada would “violate[] the contract” between BPI and Bars. At oral argument\n\nBPI’s counsel conceded that its expert made no attempt to distinguish between breach-of-\n\ncontract and unfair-competition damages.\n\n       Because BPI shouldered the burden of proving damages causally connected to its unfair-\n\ncompetition claim, its failure to do so is fatal. See Liberty Oil Corp., 258 N.W. at 244. BPI’s\n\nresponse, both in its brief and at oral argument, is to point out that the unfair-competition\n\ndamages are less than BPI’s total request for damages on both its breach-of-contract and unfair-\n\ncompetition claims.    True enough.     But that does not excuse BPI’s failure to prove with\n\nreasonable certainty damages causally connected to Bars’s unfair conduct. See Liberty Oil\n\nCorp., 258 N.W. at 244. The damages award is thus “beyond the maximum damages that the\n\njury reasonably could find to be compensatory” for any harm suffered by BPI as a result of\n\nBars’s unfair competition. See Champion v. Outlook Nashville, Inc., 380 F.3d 893, 905 (6th Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting Gregory v. Shelby Cty., 220 F.3d 433, 443 (6th Cir. 2000)); see also Liberty Oil\n\nCorp., 258 N.W. at 244. We therefore reverse the district court’s denial of Bars’s renewed\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law on BPI’s unfair-competition counterclaim.\n\nC. Bar’s Lanham Act Claim\n\n       The last appealed issue is whether the district court erred in dismissing Bars’s trademark-\n\ninfringement claim and denying its motion to amend. Because the district court denied leave to\n\namend on futility grounds, we review that denial de novo. See Evans v. Pearson Enters., Inc.,\n\n434 F.3d 839, 853 (6th Cir. 2006). Amendment is proper if Bars’s allegations, taken as true and\n\n\n\n                                               - 17 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nconstrued in the light most favorable to Bars, “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”\n\nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).\n\n       To state a claim for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, Bars needed to plead\n\nsufficient facts to establish that: (1) it owns a registered trademark; (2) the defendant used the\n\nmark in commerce; and (3) the use was likely to cause confusion. 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1); Hensley\n\nMfg., Inc. v. ProPride, Inc., 579 F.3d 603, 609 (6th Cir. 2009). Bars’s proposed amended\n\ncomplaint alleged that BPI displayed the “Bar’s Leaks” trademark at the AAPEX show in Las\n\nVegas. BPI agreed that Bars had shown the first and third factors, but disputed that its use of the\n\nmark at the show constituted “use in commerce” in the absence of proof of sales to U.S. or\n\nCanadian customers.\n\n       The district court denied Bars’s motion to amend. It allowed that BPI’s display of the\n\nBar’s Leaks mark at AAPEX “may . . . establish[] that [BPI] used the mark in commerce.” But\n\ngiven Bars’s admission that BPI attended AAPEX as Bars’s guest for many years, the court\n\ndetermined that BPI “had the authority to use the mark” at AAPEX. With this authority, the\n\ncourt concluded, BPI’s use of a separate booth alone could not constitute infringement. And\n\nbecause Bars did not allege any additional acts of infringement, such as the “use of the mark in\n\nany products sold within the United States and Canada,” the court deemed amendment futile.\n\n       Before addressing the merits, we must undertake the threshold question of how to\n\nconstrue the district court’s conclusion that BPI “had the authority to use the mark.” The court\n\ncited Allard Enterprises., Inc. v. Advanced Programming Resources, Inc., 249 F.3d 564 (6th Cir.\n\n2001), which stands for the principle that trademark rights obtained through registration are\n\nsubject to rights acquired by prior use. Id. at 572. But the prior-use doctrine has no bearing on\n\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nBars’s trademark-infringement claim. Bars was both the first actual user of the “Bar’s Leaks”\n\ntrademark and the first party to register the mark.\n\n       The court’s rationale is more properly grounded in the doctrine of “acquiescence.”\n\nAn affirmative defense to trademark infringement, acquiescence requires “a finding of conduct\n\non the plaintiff’s part that amounted to an assurance to the defendant, express or implied, that\n\nplaintiff would not assert his trademark rights against the defendant.” Elvis Presley Enters., Inc.\n\nv. Elvisly Yours, Inc., 936 F.2d 889, 894 (6th Cir. 1991) (quoting Sweetheart Plastics, Inc. v.\n\nDetroit Forming, Inc., 743 F.2d 1039, 1046 (4th Cir. 1984)).               Acquiescence requires\n\nunreasonable delay in enforcing trademark rights, prejudice to the defendant, and a showing, by\n\nwords or conduct, that the trademark holder “active[ly] consent[ed]” to use of the mark. What-\n\nA-Burger of Va., Inc. v. Whataburger, Inc. of Corpus Christi, Tex., 357 F.3d 441, 452 (4th Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 81 F.3d 455, 462 (4th Cir. 1996)).\n\nBPI asserted this defense in its answer and advances an acquiescence argument on appeal.\n\n       Courts should not dismiss based on an affirmative defense unless “the undisputed facts\n\nconclusively establish an affirmative defense as a matter of law,” Hensley Mfg., 579 F.3d at 613,\n\nfor example when “the plaintiff’s own allegations show that a defense exists that legally defeats\n\nthe claim for relief.” Marsh v. Genentech, Inc., 693 F.3d 546, 555 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting\n\n5B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur Miller, Mary Kay Kane & Richard Marcus, Federal Practice\n\n& Procedure § 1357 at 713 (3d ed. 2004)). Because acquiescence is a fact-bound defense that\n\nrequires “a qualitative examination of the parties’ words and conduct and an equitable evaluation\n\nof the length of the delay and the degree of prejudice to the defendant,” it is generally not\n\nsusceptible to resolution at the pleading stage. Hyson USA, Inc. v. Hyson 2U, Ltd., 821 F.3d 935,\n\n941 (7th Cir. 2016).\n\n                                               - 19 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n        Here, the allegations in Bars’s proposed amended complaint do not “conclusively\n\nestablish” the defense of acquiescence “as a matter of law.” Hensley Mfg., 579 F.3d at 613.\n\nThough Bars did allow BPI to be a “guest[]” at its AAPEX booth for “many years” before BPI\n\nattended separately, the complaint also alleged, in no uncertain terms, that BPI is “not authorized\n\nto use Plaintiff’s BARS Marks in any manner.” The complaint further describes how Bars sent\n\nBPI a letter prior to the AAPEX show informing BPI that “infringement” would result from\n\n“[BPI’s] use of the BARS Marks” at the show. At the motion to dismiss stage, the district court\n\nmust accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true. Logsdon v. Hains, 492 F.3d 334, 340\n\n(6th Cir. 2007) (citing Gazette v. City of Pontiac, 41 F.3d 1061, 1064 (6th Cir. 1994)).\n\n       Of course, the district court might have disregarded Bars’s statement disclaiming BPI’s\n\nauthority as conclusory or belied by other allegations in the complaint. But even if we disregard\n\nthat single averment, the complaint as a whole still fails to unambiguously establish\n\nacquiescence. For one thing, the complaint says nothing about whether BPI actually used the\n\n“Bar’s Leaks” trademark when BPI was a guest at Bars’s booth. The complaint states that Bars\n\nwas the “exhibitor” and that BPI was a “guest[] at the Plaintiff’s booth,” but is silent on whether\n\nBPI actually displayed or otherwise used the marks. At most, the complaint establishes that Bars\n\nallowed BPI to be physically present in Bars’s booth, where Bars displayed its own marks. For\n\nanother, even if Bars had affirmatively consented to BPI displaying the “Bar’s Leaks” mark,\n\nBars consented to such use in its own booth. It is certainly possible that to the extent inviting\n\nBPI can be construed as consent at all, it was contingent on BPI displaying its product side-by-\n\nside with Bars. See Just Add Water, Inc. v. Everything But Water, Inc., No. Civ. 3:04-CV-2085-\n\nH, 2005 WL 1206874, at *3 (N.D. Tex. May 18, 2005) (denying motion to dismiss on\n\nacquiescence grounds where plaintiff had previously agreed not to sue defendant for use outside\n\n                                               - 20 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nof Texas, because it was “possible that [p]laintiff’s acquiescence was contingent upon\n\n[d]efendant not using [the] mark in Texas,” which defendant had allegedly done). Finally, Bars\n\ninformed BPI prior to the show that it could not use the “Bar’s Leaks” mark. This suggests the\n\nquestion whether Bars revoked any prior consent, and if so, whether that revocation defeats\n\nBPI’s acquiescence defense.\n\n       In sum, the complaint allegations do not conclusively establish that Bars acquiesced to\n\nBPI’s use of the Bar’s Leaks trademark at AAPEX. It may be that BPI ultimately succeeds in\n\nestablishing acquiescence, but such a conclusion is not dictated by the complaint. Accordingly,\n\nwe reverse the district court’s denial of Bars’s motion for leave to amend.\n\n       One final point warrants brief discussion. Bars argues that the district court refused leave\n\nto amend on the alternative grounds that mere promotional use of a trademark, absent proof of\n\ninfringing sales, is not trademark infringement. But the district court did no such thing. The\n\ndistrict court simply held that because Bars consented to BPI’s display of the mark at AAPEX,\n\nBars would have to allege some other infringing conduct to state a claim. Because the district\n\ncourt erred in finding consent at the pleading stage, it had no occasion to address whether proof\n\nof infringing sales is necessary to state a trademark claim. We too express no view on that issue.\n\n                                                III.\n\n       For these reasons we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment in favor of BPI that denied\n\nBars’s post-verdict renewed motion on the breach-of-contract claim.\n\n       We agree that BPI could show no separate damages to support its unfair-competition\n\nclaim and thus REVERSE the district court’s judgment that denied Bars’s post-verdict renewed\n\nmotion on that claim.\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       We REVERSE the district court’s denial of Bars’s motion for leave to file an amended\n\ntrademark claim and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       JULIA SMITH GIBBONS, Circuit Judge, concurring. I concur in the majority opinion\n\nbut would say a bit more in connection with the remand of Bar’s infringement claim. The\n\nmajority notes that the district court had no occasion to address whether proof of infringing sales\n\nis necessary to state a trademark claim. But the district court may well have to address on\n\nremand whether the conduct here can constitute infringement.           Although our court has no\n\nauthority on point, the great weight of authority is that “mere advertising…standing alone, [does]\n\nnot constitute ‘use’ of the mark within the meaning of the Lahnam Act.” Buti v. Perosa, S.R.L.,\n\n139 F.3d 98, 103 (2d. Cir. 1998); see also Couture v. Playdom, Inc., 778 F.3d 1379, 1381 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2015); Int’l Bancorp, LLC v. Societe des Baines de Mer et du Cercle des Estrangers a\n\nMonaco, 329 F.3d 359, 361–66 (4th Cir. 2003); Sensient Techs. Corp. v. SensoryEffects Flavor\n\nCo., 613 F.3d 754, 759–63 (8th Cir. 2010); Guantanamera Cigar Co. v. Corporacion Habanos,\n\nS.A., 672 F. Supp. 2d 106, 110 (D.D.C. 2009). And it is uncertain whether noninfringing sales\n\nabroad can constitute use of the mark in commerce. Neither party has briefed the issue, and\n\nunder these circumstances, we elect not to consider it initially on appeal. Whether this issue is\n\nresolved at the pleading or proof stage of the litigation in the trial court, we leave it for another\n\nday.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 23 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n         SILER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. The issues raised on\n\nappeal are narrow. For that reason, I concur with the majority opinion in Sections II.A. and II.C.,\n\nbut I respectfully dissent as to Section II.B. Bar’s Products, Inc. (“Bars”) does not challenge as\n\ninadmissible the testimony of Bars Products International’s (“BPI”) damages expert. Bars also\n\ndoes not assert on appeal—or preserve through its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw—any prejudicial deficiency in the jury instructions on unfair competition.1 Instead, Bars\n\ncabins its appeal to whether the evidence overlaps between BPI’s counterclaims of breach of\n\ncontract and unfair competition. I would affirm the denial of judgment as a matter of law\n\nbecause the trial record contained evidence differentiating those two counterclaims. Under our\n\nstandard of review, the majority goes too far to suggest that reasonable minds could not separate\n\nthe evidence presented at trial.\n\n         Reversing a district court’s denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\nrequires a showing that “viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party,\n\ngiving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences, there is no genuine issue of material\n\nfact for the jury, and reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion in favor of the moving\n\nparty.” Balsley v. LFP, Inc., 691 F.3d 747, 757 (6th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). “[W]e may\n\nnot weigh the evidence, question the credibility of witnesses, or substitute our own judgment for\n\nthat of the jury.” Smith v. Rock-Tenn Servs., Inc., 813 F.3d 298, 306 (6th Cir. 2016) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n         1\n          Bars admitted at oral argument that it did not object to the jury instructions, suggesting that its motion\npractice preserved its legal theories. Our law is clear that Bars’s conduct amounts to waiver. See, e.g., Clarksville-\nMontgomery Cnty. School Sys. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 925 F.2d 993, 1006 (6th Cir. 1991) (“We first note that\nClarksville’s failure to object to a specific charge before and after the jury charge is given constitutes waiver of the\nobjection.” (citation omitted)); Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(1) (“A party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give\nan instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.”).\n\n                                                        - 24 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       The majority is correct that a plaintiff suffering damages from unfair competition can\n\nrecover only for the “loss actually sustained by plaintiff as the direct and natural consequence of\n\n[defendant’s unfair] acts.” Liberty Oil Corp. v. Crowley, Milner & Co., 258 N.W. 241, 244\n\n(Mich. 1935). But this court has also cited Liberty Oil for the proposition that only “some\n\nevidence” of “measured damages or loss of profits” is required. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v.\n\nRosen, 108 F.2d 632, 636–37 (6th Cir. 1940) (applying Liberty Oil). Although Socony-Vacuum\n\ndeclined to address what measure of evidence is sufficient to ascertain an exact damages amount,\n\nit nonetheless affirmed the judgment in the trial court because record evidence was present. Id.;\n\nsee also Skimin v. Fuelgas Co., 66 N.W.2d 666, 669 (Mich. 1954) (“The fact that damages\n\ncannot be measured easily or with mathematical certainty or absolute accuracy is no ground for\n\ndenying them.” (citation omitted)).\n\n       The trial record demonstrates that the jury heard evidence from fact witnesses and experts\n\nabout deceptive conduct and losses attributable to such conduct. Among other things, the BPI’s\n\nexpert testified that his damages models assumed “liability is found” and parsed “which sales\n\nattributed to the breach.” The expert provided various calculations depending on the legal theory\n\nasserted, accounting for product similarity and dissimilarity when including and excluding units.\n\nBPI’s counsel during oral argument characterized the damages between the counterclaims as\n\n“cumulative,” although not “apportioned.” Still, rather than concede that the expert failed to\n\ndistinguish between the counterclaims, as the majority contends, BPI’s counsel stated that the\n\njury “had ample information to segregate the damages from breach of contract and the damages\n\nfrom unfair competition.”\n\n       Bars fails to persuade that the record compels the singular conclusion that more\n\nparticularized evidence is required to prove unfair competition. Neither Bars nor the majority\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\ncites case law requiring a separate jury argument on damages for each cause of action, as\n\nopposed to one lump sum request. See Pa. R.R. Co. v. McKinley, 288 F.2d 262, 267 (6th Cir.\n\n1961) (declining to adopt a “procedural blueprint” for arguments about damages). And even if\n\nsuch case law was extant in some form, Bars did not preserve the argument that the jury was\n\nimproperly instructed on how to calculate damages. On a verdict form with separate line items\n\nfor each cause of action, the jury was asked, “State the amount of damages, if any, that you find\n\nwere caused by Plaintiff Bars competing unfairly with Defendants.” The district court reminded\n\nthe jury that “[b]reach of contract does not constitute unfair competition,” and that any\n\nconsideration of unfair competition should be resolved “separately from a breach of contract\n\nbetween the parties.” During deliberations, the jury took the instructions in earnest by requesting\n\na calculator and copies of expert trial exhibits.       Considering a request of $2,815,062 in\n\ndamages—in addition to future damages of $8,327,433—the jury awarded $974,849 in view of\n\nevidence presented at trial, none of which Bars argues on appeal was inadmissible.\n\n       The jury’s verdict on unfair competition should not be disturbed.           The trial court\n\nconcluded as much: “The Court finds that the jury’s damages award are within the range of\n\nevidence presented at trial in light of testimony presented by BPI’s fact and expert witnesses.”\n\nBar’s Prods. v. Bar’s Prods. Int’l, No. 10-14321, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130660, at *11 (E.D.\n\nMich. Sept. 29, 2015). On the record before us and standard of review to which we must adhere,\n\nwe should not reverse that conclusion. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent in part and would\n\naffirm the district court’s denial of judgment as a matter of law on Bars’s counterclaim for unfair\n\ncompetition.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\f",

For over 30 years, Bar’s Products (Bars) and Bars Products\n\nInternational (BPI) shared the worldwide market for “Bar’s Leaks” brand automotive supplies.\n\nBars sold in the United States and Canada; BPI sold internationally. This relationship soured in\n\n2007 when Bars started selling products abroad under a different brand name, and BPI responded\n\nby promoting its products at a Las Vegas trade show. Bars sued BPI, alleging trademark\n\ninfringement and unfair competition; BPI countered with breach-of-contract and unfair-\n\ncompetition claims. The district court dismissed all of Bars’s claims but allowed a jury to\n\nconsider BPI’s counterclaims. The jury awarded BPI $1,560,195 for breach of contract and\n\n$974,849 for unfair competition. On appeal, Bars argues that the district court erred in denying\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nits motion for judgment as a matter of law on both of BPI’s counterclaims and by refusing to\n\ngrant Bars leave to amend its trademark claim. We AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       In 1947, Fred Barton developed a radiator stop-leak product and later established Bars to\n\nmarket it. Barton protected his invention through patents and trademarks, holding some in his\n\nindividual capacity and others through Bars or Barton’s wholly-owned company, Huki Lau.\n\nOver the next two decades, Barton built an international distribution chain by selling raw\n\nmaterials to companies licensed to produce and sell Bars’s signature brand of “Bar’s Leaks”\n\nproducts.\n\n       BPI began as one of Bars’s foreign licensees. In 1973, Barton, Huki Lau, and Bars\n\nexecuted a series of agreements to “sell, assign and transfer” to BPI “all foreign business in any\n\nand all countries foreign to the United States except Canada including all right, title and interest\n\nin any and all . . . foreign inventions, patents, trademarks . . . together with the good will of the\n\nforeign business.” Bars was a party to only one of those agreements; Barton or Huki Lau\n\nexecuted the rest in their own names.\n\n       Through these agreements, BPI gained control over the foreign distribution of Bar’s\n\nLeaks products outside of Canada. For the next 30 years Bars and BPI maintained a harmonious\n\nbusiness relationship. Bars sold BPI the raw ingredients to make Bar’s Leaks products and\n\nneither party encroached on the other’s territory. The two companies also shared a booth for\n\nmany years at the Automotive Aftermarket Products Expo (AAPEX) in Las Vegas, with BPI\n\nattending as Bars’s guest. At these conventions, Bars referred international buyers to BPI.\n\n       This relationship deteriorated in the early 2000s when Bars increased the price of raw\n\nmaterials and proposed to purchase back all of BPI’s assets and goodwill. When BPI refused,\n\n                                                -2-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nBars demanded a two-month lead time on all orders, which, when combined with the price\n\nincrease, prompted BPI to open its own plant to manufacture the ingredients necessary to\n\nproduce Bar’s Leaks products. Bars later purchased the rights to the “Rislone” brand and began\n\nselling automotive products internationally under that label in 2007. At trial, Bars’s President\n\nadmitted that some Rislone products it sold abroad were the “same thing” as what Bars sold\n\ndomestically. Moreover, some of those products referenced “Bar’s Leaks” or “Bar’s Products”\n\non their labels. This marked the first time Bars sold products outside the United States without\n\nBPI’s blessing.\n\n       BPI attended the Las Vegas products expo with its own independent booth for the first\n\ntime in 2010. Displeased, Bars filed the present lawsuit, asserting trademark infringement and\n\nunfair competition.     BPI counterclaimed for breach of contract and unfair competition,\n\nmaintaining that Bars breached the 1973 agreements by selling automotive products abroad.\n\n       The district court dismissed Bars’s trademark claim and refused leave to amend.\n\nFollowing three-and-a-half years of motion practice, Bars and BPI finally tried the case before a\n\njury. At the close of evidence, BPI moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on Bars’s remaining claims, which the court granted, and Bars does\n\nnot appeal. The district court denied Bars’s Rule 50 motion on BPI’s breach-of-contract and\n\nunfair-competition counterclaims.      The jury then returned a verdict for BPI on both\n\ncounterclaims and awarded it $1,560,195 in breach-of-contract damages and $974,849 as\n\ndamages for unfair competition. After the verdict, Bars renewed its motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law, or in the alternative for a new trial or remittitur, which the district court denied.\n\nBars appeals, taking issue with the district court’s denial of its Rule 50 motions and the court’s\n\nrefusal to grant it leave to amend its trademark claim.\n\n                                                -3-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v.

Breach of Contract\n\n       Bars first argues that the district court should have granted its renewed motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law on BPI’s breach-of-contract counterclaim.

We agree.\n\n       1. Scope of the 1973 Agreements\n\n       Bars argues that the district court erred by allowing the jury to consider all the 1973\n\ntransferring assignments as part of the “contract” that obligated Bars, even though Barton and\n\nHuki Lau, not Bars, signed many of those assignments. At trial and on appeal, Bars maintains it\n\nshould be bound only by the single agreement it signed.\n\n       The parol evidence rule forbids the introduction of evidence of prior or contemporaneous\n\nagreements to vary the terms of a written instrument that purports to be the “final expression of\n\n[the parties’] agreement.” Mich. Comp. Laws § 440.2202; United Precision Prods. Co. v. Avco\n\nCorp., 540 F. App’x 489, 493 (6th Cir. 2013) (applying Michigan law).

Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nthe parties intended the document to represent the complete and final embodiment of their\n\nagreement, courts admit extrinsic evidence to explain the parties’ intent. See NAG Enters., Inc.\n\nv. All State Indus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2118816\"><a href=\"/opinion/2118816/nag-enterprises-inc-v-all-state-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 771 (Mich. 1979) (per curiam). And “[e]xtrinsic\n\nevidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations is admissible as it bears on this\n\nthreshold question of whether the written instrument is [the complete agreement between the\n\nparties].” Id.\n\n       Nothing in the single agreement Bars signed identifies the writing as the “final\n\nexpression” of the parties’ agreement. All the extrinsic evidence points in the other direction.\n\nBarton founded Bars and served as its president and majority shareholder for over 20 years until\n\njust before he made the assignments at issue. Barton also owned Huki Lau, which shared an\n\naddress with Bars in 1973. And during the period leading up to the 1973 agreements, Bars,\n\nBarton, and Huki Lau operated as a single entity: Bars sold product through license agreements\n\nthat Barton held in his individual capacity, using intellectual property that Barton or Huki Lau\n\nowned. A 1973 letter from Bars’s counsel to BPI—written after Barton sold his shares in Bars—\n\nacknowledges this reality. The letter references “proper Assignments from Frederic D. Barton,\n\nHuki Lau Inc. and [Bars] to [BPI],” and confirms that “[t]hese assignments are perfect and\n\neverything now appears to be in order for commencing transfer of all rights to [BPI].”\n\n       Despite all this, Bars claims that “BPI failed to submit any evidence that Barton had the\n\nauthority to enter into agreements on behalf of Bars.” Yet, as the district court noted, none of the\n\nsignatories testified at trial, meaning that BPI needed to rely on circumstantial evidence to show\n\nthat Bars intended to be bound by the Barton and Huki Lau assignments. That evidence strongly\n\nsuggests that the 1973 agreements were a package deal.\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       2. Breach\n\n       Bars argues that even considering all the agreements as a single contract, BPI produced\n\nno evidence of breach. At trial, BPI argued that Bars breached the contract by: (1) applying for\n\nforeign trademark registrations in countries where BPI owned the relevant trademarks; (2) selling\n\nproducts with the “Bar’s Leaks” trademark outside the U.S. and Canada; and (3) selling products\n\nunder the “Rislone” brand to customers outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\n       The jury awarded BPI $1,537,659 in damages for “sales of items other than Bar’s Leaks\n\noutside the United States and Canada.” This could only mean Rislone and the raw materials\n\nused to make Rislone, because those are the only products “other than Bar’s Leaks” that Bars\n\nsells. Yet Bars reasons that because it did not own Rislone in 1973, selling Rislone could only\n\nconstitute breach if the 1973 agreements include a non-compete provision or non-solicitation\n\ncovenant. Bars insists that BPI failed to establish either.\n\n       BPI disclaims ever arguing that the 1973 agreements contain a non-compete provision or\n\nimplied non-solicitation covenant. BPI maintains that it purchased “the exclusive rights to sell\n\nthe Bars’ product line in all countries (outside of the U.S. and Canada),” and Bars breached by\n\nselling automotive products abroad, whether labeled as “Bar’s Leaks” or “Rislone,” and\n\nregardless of whether those products existed in 1973.\n\n       The district court instructed the jury that it could construe the contract as including either\n\nan agreement that limits competition or an implied non-solicitation covenant.

Accordingly,\n\nBars is correct that if the district court erred in submitting to the jury either a non-competition or\n\nnon-solicitation theory of liability, a new trial is warranted.

We consider each theory in turn and\n\nconclude that the district court committed no error.\n\n               a. Non-Competition Theory\n\n       Bars argues that in the absence of a non-compete provision in the 1973 agreements, BPI\n\ncould have no tenable claim. According to Bars, non-compete agreements must be “expressly\n\nreserved in a contract,” and because the 1973 assignments did not do so, the district court ought\n\nto have ruled in favor of Bars on BPI’s non-competition theory of breach.\n\n       Before addressing the merits, BPI suggests that Bars waived this argument by failing to\n\nobject to the jury instructions. But because Bars argued that the agreements lack a non-compete\n\nagreement in multiple motions before the district court—including in its motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law before the court gave the pertinent instructions—Bars preserved this argument\n\nfor appeal. See K&T Enters., Inc. v. Zurich Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727247\"><a href=\"/opinion/727247/k-t-enterprises-inc-dba-dairy-queen-of-blissfield-and-tahani-khoury/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174–75 (6th Cir. 1996).\n\n       By framing our interpretative task narrowly—does the contract include an express non-\n\ncompetition provision—Bars invites the answer: clearly not. That, says BPI, is not the right\n\nquestion: The jury was not asked to find an express non-competition provision in the contract.\n\nThe district court instructed the jury that it could find the parties to have “entered into an\n\n                                                -7-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v.

Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       The 1973 agreements are “susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations,” and\n\ntherefore ambiguous. City of Wyandotte, 262 F.3d at 585 (quoting D’Avanzo, 565 N.W.2d at\n\n918). The 1973 agreements all include similar language transferring to BPI “all foreign business\n\nin any and all countries foreign to the United States except Canada, including all right . . . in any\n\nand all such [intellectual property] . . . including but not being limited to” specified foreign\n\ntrademarks, as “fully and entirely as the same would have been held by [Bars] had this\n\nassignment and sale not been made.” The agreements describe the business sold as “radiator and\n\ncooling system products.”\n\n       This language could reasonably be read to transfer not only the foreign rights in Bars’s\n\nautomotive and radiator cooling products circa 1973, but also the right to market Bars’s future\n\nproduct line of radiator and cooling products. The words “including but not being limited to”\n\nand “any and all foreign countries” clearly contemplate the transfer of intellectual property other\n\nthan what is described in the contract, making the transfer of associated future business a\n\nreasonable contract interpretation.\n\n       Bars resists a finding of ambiguity by focusing on the way the contracts describe the\n\n“foreign business” BPI sought to buy. All the 1973 agreements explain that Bars “is doing\n\nbusiness pertaining to radiator and cooling system products” and specify that BPI “is desirous of\n\nacquiring such business in all countries foreign to the United States except Canada.” According\n\nto Bars, the use of the present-tense verb “is” makes clear that the parties intended to transfer\n\nonly Bars’s foreign business and intellectual property as of 1973.\n\n       Bars’s argument has force, but the use of the present-tense verb does not bear the\n\ncontrolling weight that Bars assigns to it. “[L]egal drafters frequently use the present tense to\n\ncover the present and the future.” Multimatic, Inc. v. Faurecia Int. Sys. USA, Inc., 358 F. App’x\n\n                                                -9-\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v.

[,] [f]urthermore, the present tense may be used when the time is actually indefinite.”\n\n(internal citation omitted)). And here, the use of the present-tense does little to resolve the\n\nambiguity present in the contract as a whole. First, that Bars would describe the nature of its\n\nbusiness in the present tense is unremarkable. Second, while one of the 1973 agreements\n\ntransfers “such foreign business,” clearly referencing the preamble, the others transfer “all\n\nforeign business,” without referring to the business that Bars “is doing.” Third, the contracts\n\ntransfer “all foreign business in any and all countries foreign to the United States . . . including\n\nbut not being limited to” the business associated with Bars’s existing intellectual property. Had\n\nthe parties intended to transfer only the business associated with Bars’s intellectual property\n\ncirca 1973, the language “any and all” and “including but not being limited to” would be\n\nredundant.\n\n       Because we find the 1973 agreements ambiguous, only harmless error resulted from\n\nletting the jury determine ambiguity. And given this ambiguity, the jury could properly consider\n\nextrinsic evidence to discern the parties’ intent. At trial, BPI found support for its reading of the\n\n1973 agreements in the parties’ course of conduct. First, Bars sent BPI a letter shortly after all\n\nthe agreements were executed stating that “[t]hese assignments are perfect and everything now\n\nappears to be in order for commencing transfer of all rights to [BPI].” Second, Bars sold no\n\nproducts outside the United States, Canada, or Mexico for over thirty years between 1973 and\n\n2007, and instead treated BPI as its exclusive international partner even as BPI’s presence\n\nexpanded beyond the markets that Bars serviced in 1973. Third, when Bars wanted to sell\n\nproducts in Mexico in 1998, it sought and obtained a license from BPI in exchange for the\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\npayment of licensing fees. From this conduct a reasonable juror could find that Bars granted BPI\n\nthe exclusive right to sell its current and future products abroad.\n\n               b. Implied Non-Solicitation Theory\n\n       Bars next argues that no reasonable juror could have found a breach of the implied non-\n\nsolicitation covenant.     “[U]nder Michigan law, the sale of a business along with its\n\naccompanying good will gives rise to a covenant precluding the seller from soliciting back to\n\nhimself that which he has sold.” Worgess Agency, Inc. v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1309985\"><a href=\"/opinion/1309985/worgess-agency-inc-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421 (Mich. Ct.\n\nApp. 1976).     Bars maintains that Michigan law requires proving solicitation of a “former\n\ncustomer,” and asserts that its only international customers in 1973 were the eight foreign\n\ndistributors to whom it sold raw materials. Because the jury heard no evidence that it solicited\n\none of those customers, Bars concludes that it could not have breached the implied covenant.\n\n       Bars’s argument is flawed in several respects. To begin, Bars cites no case that would\n\nrequire the district court (or this court) to find that Bars’s only customers as of 1973 were its\n\nforeign distributors. That Bars only sold through distributors does not mean that end-users are\n\nnot its customers as a matter of law. Many companies make products intended for mass\n\nconsumption but choose to sell through distributors. The implied covenant would be toothless if\n\nsuch a company could sell its entire business and goodwill, and then turn around and set up an\n\nidentical business so long as it reaches consumers through a different distribution chain.

Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n        Bars’s argument that BPI was required to show solicitation of one of the 1973 distributors\n\nalso assumes that the 1973 agreements transferred only Bars’s then-existing foreign business.\n\nAs discussed above, however, the jury could construe the contract to transfer to BPI all foreign\n\nbusiness in radiator and cooling products, not just the business Bars was doing in 1973. And\n\nbecause the core of a Worgess claim is “soliciting back . . . that which [is] sold,” Worgess,\n\n239 N.W.2d at 421, this distinction matters. As the jury heard, Bars sold automotive products\n\nabroad under the Rislone brand, many of which were similar to or the same as products that BPI\n\nsold as “Bar’s Leaks.” The jury also heard evidence that, in some cases, Bars simply placed a\n\nRislone sticker over “Bar’s Leaks” products and displayed them at international trade shows.\n\nMoreover, some of the Rislone products sold abroad referenced “Bar’s Leaks” or “Bar’s\n\nProducts” on their labels. A reasonable juror could conclude that Bars “solicited back” the\n\nforeign business that it sold by selling substantially the same products under the Rislone brand\n\nname.\n\n               c. Alleged Scope and Duration Errors\n\n        Bars presents two final arguments—both flawed—for why the district court erred in\n\ndenying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on BPI’s breach-of-contract counterclaim.\n\nBars argues that even if the district court properly submitted the non-compete theory to the jury,\n\nthe court “erred by failing to impose a reasonable scope and duration on the alleged” agreements.\n\nAnd to the extent the jury found breach of a non-solicitation covenant, Bars maintains that any\n\ncovenant lasting decades is not supported by Worgess.\n\n        Bars’s first argument—that a perpetual worldwide non-compete is unreasonable—seems\n\nat first, well, reasonable. No one disputes that “[n]ever is a long time.” Wolverine Sign Works v.\n\nPowers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3494485\"><a href=\"/opinion/3524963/wolverine-sign-works-v-powers/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 670 (Mich. 1929).

Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nreasonableness of express non-compete clauses in employment or business-sale contracts. In\n\nsuch cases, the duration and geographic scope are specified, and the court analyzes the express\n\nterms to determine whether they are reasonable in light of any legitimate business interests.\n\nSee, e.g., St. Clair Med., P.C. v. Borgiel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2026165\"><a href=\"/opinion/2026165/st-clair-medical-pc-v-borgiel/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 918–19 (Mich. Ct. App. 2006). BPI’s\n\nargument to the jury, however, was not that the 1973 agreements include an express non-\n\ncompete clause, but rather that Bars sold BPI the exclusive right to sell Bars’s radiator and\n\ncooling products abroad. Cases involving express non-compete clauses therefore provide little\n\ninstruction.\n\n       Even if we entertain Bars’s argument and analyze the 1973 agreements as we would an\n\nexpress non-compete, we would still not fault the district court for denying judgment as a matter\n\nof law. “Agreements not to compete are permissible under Michigan law as long as they are\n\nreasonable.”   Thermatool Corp. v.

Were we the factfinder, we might agree with Bars that an implied\n\ncovenant expired before Bars began selling Rislone. But respect for Worgess and respect for the\n\njury’s role prevents us from entering judgment as a matter of law unless “no reasonable juror”\n\ncould have found the implied covenant to still be in effect. Kiphart, 251 F.3d at 581 (quoting\n\nMoore, 171 F.3d at 1078). That is a high bar and one that Bars fails to clear.\n\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to BPI, both the non-compete and non-\n\nsolicitation theories submitted to the jury enjoy legal and evidentiary support. We accordingly\n\naffirm the district court’s judgment with respect to BPI’s breach-of-contract counterclaim.\n\nB. Unfair Competition\n\n       Bars next argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on BPI’s unfair-\n\ncompetition counterclaim because the claim relies on the same conduct underlying BPI’s breach-\n\nof-contract counterclaim. In the alternative, Bars asserts that BPI failed to prove damages\n\ncausally connected to any unfair conduct, thereby warranting reversal, remittitur, or a new trial\n\non damages.\n\n       Michigan law prohibits “any conduct that is fraudulent or deceptive and tends to mislead\n\nthe public.” ATCO Indus., Inc. v.

Mich. Mar. 31, 2009) (applying Liberty Oil and reversing verdict\n\nwhere defendant presented “no evidence from which a reasonable jury could begin to determine\n\nany amount of actual damages with reasonable certainty”).\n\n       The jury awarded BPI $974,849 in damages for unfair competition. In opposing Bars’s\n\nrenewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, BPI cited three acts that arguably show breach\n\nof a duty “separate and distinct” from breach of contract. The district court relied on these acts\n\nin denying Bars’s motion. First, the court credited testimony suggesting that Bars registered\n\ntrademarks in foreign countries where BPI owned the relevant marks. Second, the court cited\n\nevidence that Bars attempted to sell raw materials to Sonax—one of BPI’s European licensees—\n\nfor use in “Bar’s Leaks” products, and “conspired with others to sell products [in] countries\n\nwhere BPI held the trademarks of the products.” Third, the court concluded that Bars “may have\n\nattempted to deceive the public or those purchasing the products that [it] had the authority to sell\n\nsuch products outside the United States and Canada.”\n\n       Assuming, without deciding, that these acts constitute unfair competition under Michigan\n\nlaw, BPI failed to prove damages causally connected to that conduct. The district court properly\n\ninstructed the jury that BPI must prove damages “sustained . . . as a result of Bar’s unfair\n\ncompetition.” At trial, however, BPI failed to distinguish between breach-of-contract and unfair-\n\ncompetition damages at all. In fact, BPI did not even attempt to calculate its losses from the\n\nconduct that it claims was unfair. BPI’s damages model calculated lost profits due to Bars’s\n\ninternational sales of Bar’s Leaks, Rislone, and raw materials, but BPI’s position at trial and on\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\nappeal is that these sales constitute breach of contract. Indeed, BPI’s damages expert testified\n\nthat his model assumed that Bars’s sale of Bar’s Leaks, Rislone, and raw materials outside the\n\nUnited States or Canada would “violate[] the contract” between BPI and Bars. At oral argument\n\nBPI’s counsel conceded that its expert made no attempt to distinguish between breach-of-\n\ncontract and unfair-competition damages.\n\n       Because BPI shouldered the burden of proving damages causally connected to its unfair-\n\ncompetition claim, its failure to do so is fatal. See Liberty Oil Corp., 258 N.W. at 244. BPI’s\n\nresponse, both in its brief and at oral argument, is to point out that the unfair-competition\n\ndamages are less than BPI’s total request for damages on both its breach-of-contract and unfair-\n\ncompetition claims.    True enough.     But that does not excuse BPI’s failure to prove with\n\nreasonable certainty damages causally connected to Bars’s unfair conduct. See Liberty Oil\n\nCorp., 258 N.W. at 244. The damages award is thus “beyond the maximum damages that the\n\njury reasonably could find to be compensatory” for any harm suffered by BPI as a result of\n\nBars’s unfair competition.

Bars’s proposed amended\n\ncomplaint alleged that BPI displayed the “Bar’s Leaks” trademark at the AAPEX show in Las\n\nVegas. BPI agreed that Bars had shown the first and third factors, but disputed that its use of the\n\nmark at the show constituted “use in commerce” in the absence of proof of sales to U.S. or\n\nCanadian customers.\n\n       The district court denied Bars’s motion to amend. It allowed that BPI’s display of the\n\nBar’s Leaks mark at AAPEX “may . . . establish[] that [BPI] used the mark in commerce.” But\n\ngiven Bars’s admission that BPI attended AAPEX as Bars’s guest for many years, the court\n\ndetermined that BPI “had the authority to use the mark” at AAPEX. With this authority, the\n\ncourt concluded, BPI’s use of a separate booth alone could not constitute infringement. And\n\nbecause Bars did not allege any additional acts of infringement, such as the “use of the mark in\n\nany products sold within the United States and Canada,” the court deemed amendment futile.\n\n       Before addressing the merits, we must undertake the threshold question of how to\n\nconstrue the district court’s conclusion that BPI “had the authority to use the mark.” The court\n\ncited Allard Enterprises., Inc. v.

Bars was both the first actual user of the “Bar’s Leaks”\n\ntrademark and the first party to register the mark.\n\n       The court’s rationale is more properly grounded in the doctrine of “acquiescence.”\n\nAn affirmative defense to trademark infringement, acquiescence requires “a finding of conduct\n\non the plaintiff’s part that amounted to an assurance to the defendant, express or implied, that\n\nplaintiff would not assert his trademark rights against the defendant.” Elvis Presley Enters., Inc.\n\nv.

But even if we disregard\n\nthat single averment, the complaint as a whole still fails to unambiguously establish\n\nacquiescence. For one thing, the complaint says nothing about whether BPI actually used the\n\n“Bar’s Leaks” trademark when BPI was a guest at Bars’s booth. The complaint states that Bars\n\nwas the “exhibitor” and that BPI was a “guest[] at the Plaintiff’s booth,” but is silent on whether\n\nBPI actually displayed or otherwise used the marks. At most, the complaint establishes that Bars\n\nallowed BPI to be physically present in Bars’s booth, where Bars displayed its own marks. For\n\nanother, even if Bars had affirmatively consented to BPI displaying the “Bar’s Leaks” mark,\n\nBars consented to such use in its own booth. It is certainly possible that to the extent inviting\n\nBPI can be construed as consent at all, it was contingent on BPI displaying its product side-by-\n\nside with Bars. See Just Add Water, Inc. v.

Finally, Bars\n\ninformed BPI prior to the show that it could not use the “Bar’s Leaks” mark. This suggests the\n\nquestion whether Bars revoked any prior consent, and if so, whether that revocation defeats\n\nBPI’s acquiescence defense.\n\n       In sum, the complaint allegations do not conclusively establish that Bars acquiesced to\n\nBPI’s use of the Bar’s Leaks trademark at AAPEX. It may be that BPI ultimately succeeds in\n\nestablishing acquiescence, but such a conclusion is not dictated by the complaint. Accordingly,\n\nwe reverse the district court’s denial of Bars’s motion for leave to amend.\n\n       One final point warrants brief discussion. Bars argues that the district court refused leave\n\nto amend on the alternative grounds that mere promotional use of a trademark, absent proof of\n\ninfringing sales, is not trademark infringement. But the district court did no such thing. The\n\ndistrict court simply held that because Bars consented to BPI’s display of the mark at AAPEX,\n\nBars would have to allege some other infringing conduct to state a claim. Because the district\n\ncourt erred in finding consent at the pleading stage, it had no occasion to address whether proof\n\nof infringing sales is necessary to state a trademark claim. We too express no view on that issue.\n\n                                                III.\n\n       For these reasons we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment in favor of BPI that denied\n\nBars’s post-verdict renewed motion on the breach-of-contract claim.\n\n       We agree that BPI could show no separate damages to support its unfair-competition\n\nclaim and thus REVERSE the district court’s judgment that denied Bars’s post-verdict renewed\n\nmotion on that claim.\n\n\n\n                                               - 21 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v.

Under our\n\nstandard of review, the majority goes too far to suggest that reasonable minds could not separate\n\nthe evidence presented at trial.\n\n         Reversing a district court’s denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\nrequires a showing that “viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party,\n\ngiving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences, there is no genuine issue of material\n\nfact for the jury, and reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion in favor of the moving\n\nparty.” Balsley v.

Our law is clear that Bars’s conduct amounts to waiver. See, e.g., Clarksville-\nMontgomery Cnty. School Sys. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555834\"><a href=\"/opinion/555834/clarksville-montgomery-county-school-system-v-united-states-gypsum/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1006 (6th Cir. 1991) (“We first note that\nClarksville’s failure to object to a specific charge before and after the jury charge is given constitutes waiver of the\nobjection.” (citation omitted)); Fed.

P. 51(c)(1) (“A party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give\nan instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.”).\n\n                                                        - 24 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\n       The majority is correct that a plaintiff suffering damages from unfair competition can\n\nrecover only for the “loss actually sustained by plaintiff as the direct and natural consequence of\n\n[defendant’s unfair] acts.” Liberty Oil Corp. v. Crowley, Milner & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3492367\"><a href=\"/opinion/3523090/oil-corp-v-crowley-milner-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244\n\n(Mich. 1935). But this court has also cited Liberty Oil for the proposition that only “some\n\nevidence” of “measured damages or loss of profits” is required. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v.\n\nRosen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1477876\"><a href=\"/opinion/1477876/socony-vacuum-oil-co-v-rosen/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 636–37 (6th Cir. 1940) (applying Liberty Oil). Although Socony-Vacuum\n\ndeclined to address what measure of evidence is sufficient to ascertain an exact damages amount,\n\nit nonetheless affirmed the judgment in the trial court because record evidence was present. Id.;\n\nsee also Skimin v. Fuelgas Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 (Mich. 1954) (“The fact that damages\n\ncannot be measured easily or with mathematical certainty or absolute accuracy is no ground for\n\ndenying them.” (citation omitted)).\n\n       The trial record demonstrates that the jury heard evidence from fact witnesses and experts\n\nabout deceptive conduct and losses attributable to such conduct. Among other things, the BPI’s\n\nexpert testified that his damages models assumed “liability is found” and parsed “which sales\n\nattributed to the breach.” The expert provided various calculations depending on the legal theory\n\nasserted, accounting for product similarity and dissimilarity when including and excluding units.\n\nBPI’s counsel during oral argument characterized the damages between the counterclaims as\n\n“cumulative,” although not “apportioned.” Still, rather than concede that the expert failed to\n\ndistinguish between the counterclaims, as the majority contends, BPI’s counsel stated that the\n\njury “had ample information to segregate the damages from breach of contract and the damages\n\nfrom unfair competition.”\n\n       Bars fails to persuade that the record compels the singular conclusion that more\n\nparticularized evidence is required to prove unfair competition. Neither Bars nor the majority\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\fCase No. 14-1611\nBar’s Products Inc. v. Bars Products International Inc., et al.\n\n\ncites case law requiring a separate jury argument on damages for each cause of action, as\n\nopposed to one lump sum request. See Pa. R.R. Co. v. McKinley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"253484\"><a href=\"/opinion/253484/pennsylvania-railroad-company-v-clarence-a-mckinley/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 267 (6th Cir.\n\n1961) (declining to adopt a “procedural blueprint” for arguments about damages). And even if\n\nsuch case law was extant in some form, Bars did not preserve the argument that the jury was\n\nimproperly instructed on how to calculate damages. On a verdict form with separate line items\n\nfor each cause of action, the jury was asked, “State the amount of damages, if any, that you find\n\nwere caused by Plaintiff Bars competing unfairly with Defendants.” The district court reminded\n\nthe jury that “[b]reach of contract does not constitute unfair competition,” and that any\n\nconsideration of unfair competition should be resolved “separately from a breach of contract\n\nbetween the parties.” During deliberations, the jury took the instructions in earnest by requesting\n\na calculator and copies of expert trial exhibits.       Considering a request of $2,815,062 in\n\ndamages—in addition to future damages of $8,327,433—the jury awarded $974,849 in view of\n\nevidence presented at trial, none of which Bars argues on appeal was inadmissible.\n\n       The jury’s verdict on unfair competition should not be disturbed.           The trial court\n\nconcluded as much: “The Court finds that the jury’s damages award are within the range of\n\nevidence presented at trial in light of testimony presented by BPI’s fact and expert witnesses.”\n\nBar’s Prods. v. Bar’s Prods. Int’l, No. 10-14321, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

On the record before us and standard of review to which we must adhere,\n\nwe should not reverse that conclusion. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent in part and would\n\naffirm the district court’s denial of judgment as a matter of law on Bars’s counterclaim for unfair\n\ncompetition.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 26 -\n\f</pre>",
