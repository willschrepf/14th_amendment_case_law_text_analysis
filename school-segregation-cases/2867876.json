Rising\nDepartment of Justice\n820 North French Street\nWilmington, DE 18901\n\nAttorney for Appellees\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nLEWIS, Circuit Judge.\n\nJerome K. Hamilton appeals from a district court order\ngranting a motion to dismiss his civil suit, litigated pro se.\nHamilton brought suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\nagainst Faith Levy, Pamela Faulkner, William Queener,\nmembers of the Multi-Disciplinary Team at the Gander Hill\nprison facility in Wilmington, Delaware (the \"MDT\ndefendants\"), and Frances Lewis, chairperson of the\nDelaware Department of Corrections Central Institutional\nClassification Committee (\"CICC\"). He alleges that the\nappellees violated his right to be free from cruel and\nunusual punishment, guaranteed by the Eighth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically,\nHamilton claims that these defendants knew of and\ndisregarded an excessive risk to his safety posed by other\ninmates.\n\nThis case requires us to determine whether the district\ncourt misapplied the Supreme Court's decision in Farmer v.\nBrennan, 114 S. Ct. 1970 (1994), in which the Court\nannounced the guidelines for determining \"deliberate\nindifference\" on the part of prison officials for purposes of\nEighth Amendment claims. We must also determine\nwhether the district court erred when it declined to allow\nHamilton to pursue discovery, denied his request for the\n\n                    2\n\fappointment of counsel and refused to permit him to\namend his complaint to add new defendants.\n\nFor the reasons explained below, we will reverse.\n\nI.\n\nHamilton has a long history of being assaulted\nthroughout the Delaware prison system. He has been\ntransferred out of the State of Delaware twice, and has\nbeen placed in protective custody on numerous occasions.\nWhile an explanation for each of Hamilton's violent clashes\nthroughout the prison system is absent from the record,\nthe fact that Hamilton's safety has been an ongoing concern\nis not in dispute.\n\nThe earliest evidence of violence against Hamilton dates\nback to February 14, 1976. On that day he was stabbed by\na fellow inmate while incarcerated in the Maximum\nSecurity Unit (\"MSU\") at the Delaware Correctional Center\nin Smyrna, Delaware (\"DCC\"). Over a year later, on May 8,\n1977, an inmate attacked Hamilton with a chair in the\nMSU. On August 1, 1977, he was assaulted in the MSU by\ntwenty inmates who stabbed him in the back, stomach and\narms. He also suffered severe lacerations to the head and\nface, which required his hospitalization at the Institution\nHospital at Gander Hill. For his own protection, Hamilton\nremained confined there for four months with no outside\nactivities whatsoever. During that time, Hamilton made an\neffort to return to the MSU, but due to threats by other\ninmates, he was placed in protective custody pursuant to\nthe \"Inmates Rule (31) Emergency Provisions\" procedure.\nAppellant's app. at 44a. Hamilton was later transferred out\nof the Delaware state prison system entirely and was held\nin federal custody in Leavenworth, Kansas. The stated\nreasons for Hamilton's transfer were to alleviate\novercrowding and because \"[Hamilton] had been assaulted\nand stabbed at the DCC and the staff feared for his safety.\"\nId. at 27a.\n\nAt some point between 1982 and 1984, Hamilton was\nreturned from federal custody to the custody of the State of\nDelaware, where he was again incarcerated at Gander Hill.\nThe assaults continued. On March 25, 1985, he was\n\n                    3\n\ftransferred to the general prison population at Sussex\nCorrectional Institution in Georgetown, Delaware. There, he\neventually notified officials that his \"life was in danger\" and\nthat he would \"be killed\" if he remained there. Prison\nofficials believed him. The following week, they\nrecommended that he be placed in protective custody back\nat Gander Hill. Hamilton was later transferred, on April 11,\n1986, from Gander Hill to DCC. Hamilton was informed\nthat the reason for his transfer was that \"it [was] felt that\n[he] may be in danger of physical harm should [he]\ncontinue to be housed [at Gander Hill].\" Id. at 17a. In a\ndocument prepared by a member of the MDT, it was\nexplained that \"[Hamilton] was moved because he required\nprotective custody in a more secure setting in that his life\nwas in danger at [Gander Hill].\" Id. at 47a. On May 21,\n1986, Hamilton was placed in protective custody at DCC.\n\nFor reasons not apparent from the record, and despite\nthe serious concerns described above, Hamilton was again\nreturned to Gander Hill at some point in 1986. At that\ntime, Hamilton cooperated with an official investigation of\ndrug trafficking that led to the arrest of officers and\ninmates at Gander Hill. Not surprisingly, Hamilton was\nthen labeled \"a snitch\" within certain circles of the prison\npopulation. Id. at 10a. This latest development required\nnumerous transfers of Hamilton into protective custody.\nFrances Lewis, CICC Chairperson, personally approved\ntransfers on November 16, 1988 and February 8, 1989, and\nHamilton was recommended for protective custody again on\nMay 11, 1989. Even up until November 30, 1989, the MDT\nacknowledged that Hamilton's need for protective custody\nhad not changed. In fact, while Hamilton was still in\nprotective custody at Gander Hill, the MDT recommended\non August 17, 1990, that he be transferred \"out of the\nbuilding\" to protective custody at another location. Id. at\n29a. Because there appeared to be no safe place for\nHamilton in the Delaware prisons, on September 4, 1990,\nprison officials decided that Hamilton would be transferred\nto Virginia to ensure his safety. Id. at 18a.\n\nOn December 12, 1991, Hamilton was temporarily\nreturned from Virginia to Gander Hill for the purpose of\nprosecuting two civil actions in the Delaware courts, one of\n\n                    4\n\fwhich was an action against Delaware prison officials.\nConcern for Hamilton's safety was again triggered, when,\non March 25, 1992, in a room at Gander Hill with several\ninmates present, a guard called Hamilton \"a good telling\nmother f_____g snitcher.\" Id. at 25a. A committee appointed\nto investigate this incident, apparently recognizing the risk\nto Hamilton's safety, concluded that \"comments of this\nnature [have] the potential of a major disturbance and\nrequires immediate action.\" Id. at 24a. The guard who made\nthe statement was later reprimanded.\n\nOn June 18, 1992, Levy, Faulkner and Queener\nconvened a MDT meeting at Gander Hill to review\nHamilton's security classification and consider his request\nto be placed in protective custody. The MDT made an\nadministrative summary of the reasons for Hamilton's\nearlier transfer to Virginia and for his return to Delaware.\nAfter reviewing Hamilton's history of being assaulted in\nprison, the MDT unanimously recommended that Hamilton\nbe placed in protective custody. But despite their own\nrecommendation, the MDT took no immediate action to\nprotect Hamilton. The MDT's report and recommendation\nwere forwarded to the CICC, chaired by Lewis. The CICC\nthereafter made a unanimous determination to take\"no\naction.\"\n\nConsequently, Hamilton remained in the general\npopulation. Less than two months following the CICC's \"no\naction\" determination, on August 5, 1992, Hamilton was\nassaulted by another prisoner. The prisoner who pleaded\nguilty to the assault stated that he committed the offense\nbecause Hamilton was \"a snitcher on inmates and officers\nat [Gander Hill].\" Appellant's br. at 22. As a result of the\nassault, Hamilton required surgery to repair two jaw\nfractures and currently has two metal plates in his both\nsides of his jaw.\n\nHamilton thereafter filed suit in district court, claiming\nthat prison officials violated state prison regulations and\nshowed a deliberate indifference to his safety, thereby\nviolating his constitutional right under the Eighth\nAmendment to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n                   5\n\fII.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of\nthe MDT defendants on the ground that they recommended\nthat Hamilton be placed in protective custody, and were\nwithout authority to effectuate that recommendation. The\ndistrict court also granted summary judgment in Lewis's\nfavor on the ground that the facts did not establish that\nshe was aware of the risk to Hamilton, and that a\nreasonable factfinder could not find otherwise. This appeal\nfollowed.\n\nThe district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nยงยง 1331 and 1342. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. ยง 1291. We exercise plenary review over a district\ncourt's order granting summary judgment. Public Interest\nResearch Group of New Jersey, Inc. v. Powell Duffryn\nTerminals, Inc., 913 F.2d 64, 76 (3d Cir. 1990).\"[W]e apply\nthe same test as the district court should have used\ninitially,\" id. at 76, to determine if there are any remaining\nissues of material fact that would enable Hamilton to\nprevail after giving him the benefit of every favorable\ninference that can be drawn from the record. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).\n\nIII.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and\nunusual punishment protects prisoners against the\n\"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\" Whitley v.\nAlbers, 475 U.S. 312, 219 (1986) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This constitutional limitation on punishment has\nbeen interpreted to impose a duty upon prison officials to\ntake reasonable measures \" `to protect prisoners from\nviolence at the hands of other prisoners.' \" Farmer v.\nBrennan, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1976 (1994) (quoting Cortes-\nQuinones v. Jimeniz-Nettleship, 842 F.2d 556, 558 (1st Cir.\n1988)). While \"[i]t is not . . . every injury suffered by one\nprisoner at the hands of another that translates into\nconstitutional liability for prison officials responsible for a\nvictim's safety,\" \"[b]eing violently assaulted in prison is\nsimply not `part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay\nfor their offenses against society.' \" Farmer, 114 S. Ct. at\n\n                    6\n\f1977 (quoting Rhodes v. Chapman, 45 U.S. 337, 345\n(1981)). Accordingly, \"[a] prison official's deliberate\nindifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to an\ninmate violates the Eighth Amendment.\" Id., at 1974.\n\nFor an inmate to prevail on an Eighth Amendment\nfailure-to-protect claim, two requirements must be met.\nFirst, the prisoner must demonstrate \"that he is\nincarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of\nserious harm.\" Id. at 1977. This element is satisfied when\nthe alleged \"punishment\" is \"objectively sufficiently\nserious.\" Id. Second, the prison officials involved must have\na sufficiently culpable state of mind. Id. at 1979 (\"[O]ur\ncases mandate inquiry into a prison official's state of mind\nwhen it is claimed that the official has inflicted cruel and\nunusual punishment.\"). Specifically, the inmate must show\nthat the official \"knows of and disregards an excessive risk\nto inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware\nof facts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exists, and [s]he must also\ndraw the inference.\" Id.\n\nConsequently, to survive summary judgment on an\nEighth Amendment claim asserted under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983,\na plaintiff is required to produce sufficient evidence of (1) a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm; (2) the defendants'\ndeliberate indifference to that risk; and (3) causation.\nLaMarca v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1526, 1535 (11th Cir. 1993).\n\nIV.\n\nA.\n\nIn its grant of summary judgment in favor of Lewis, the\ndistrict court found \"no credible evidence of record that\n[Hamilton] faced a substantial risk of serious harm from\nany inmate during his temporary classification to the\ngeneral population [at Gander Hill], or that [Lewis] had\nknowledge of such so as to justify characterizing her June\n24, 1992 classification decision as the infliction of\npunishment.\" Dist. ct. op. at 7.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the district court relied\nprimarily on Lewis's affidavit in which she explains her\n\n                    7\n\frefusal to place Hamilton in protective custody despite the\nMDT's recommendation to provide him with such\nprotection. She claimed that \"Hamilton was kept at [Gander\nHill] because there was no evidence of a problem there.\"\nShe further commented that \"[i]f valid evidence of a danger\nto plaintiff existed at [Gander Hill], the Committee would\nhave classified him appropriately.\" The district court\nconsidered Lewis's affidavit conclusive in determining that\nno material issues of fact existed for resolution at trial. Our\nreview of the record brings us to the opposite conclusion.\n\nThe district court erred in failing to acknowledge the\nMDT's recommendation that Hamilton should be placed in\nprotective custody as evidence that he faced a substantial\nrisk of serious harm. The MDT members, on June 18,\n1992, considered Hamilton's history of violent clashes\nthroughout the Delaware prison system, and acknowledged\nhis statement that \"protective custody concerns exist\nthroughout the state.\"1 The MDT members then concluded,\nunanimously, that Hamilton was in such danger as to\njustify isolating him from the general population in\nprotective custody. Because there is no indication in the\nrecord that the MDT's recommendation was unwarranted or\none-sided, we see no basis for the district court's\nconclusion that there was no evidence that Hamilton faced\na substantial risk of serious harm.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The district court concluded that Hamilton failed to initiate the\nclassification review proceeding in June, 1992, and that this militated\nagainst a finding of deliberate indifference on the part of Lewis. However,\nthe MDT Memorandum reveals that Hamilton did \"claim that the\nprotective custody concerns still exist throughout the state.\" Appellant's\napp. at 11a. We note that the district court's reasoning suggesting that\nHamilton was required to give advance notice of his safety concerns is\ninconsistent with the teachings of Farmer. There, while the plaintiff\nvoiced no concern about his placement in the general population where\nhe was assaulted, this fact was insufficient to support a grant of\nsummary judgment for the defendants. Farmer, 114 S. Ct. at 1984-85\n(\"[T]he District Court may have mistakenly thought that advance notice\nwas a necessary element of an Eighth Amendment claim. . . .\").\nAccordingly, in this case, the question of who initiated the June 18,\n1992 classification review will have no bearing on the question of Lewis's\nawareness of the risk posed to Hamilton.\n\n                    8\n\fYet, a showing that there was an excessive risk to\nHamilton's safety is alone insufficient to preclude summary\njudgment. Hamilton must also show that the harm he\nsuffered was caused by a prison official's deliberate\nindifference to his safety. Deliberate indifference can be\nshown when \"a prison official knows of and disregards an\nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety.\" Farmer, 114 S.\nCt. at 1979. We are therefore required to \"focus[on] what\na defendant's mental attitude actually was (or is), rather\nthan what it should have been (or should be).\" Id. at 1980.\nThe Court believed this subjective approach to be\nappropriate because it \"isolates those who inflict\npunishment.\" Id.\n\nIn this case, Lewis was made aware of a substantial risk\nto Hamilton's safety when she reviewed the MDT's\nunanimous recommendation to place Hamilton in protective\ncustody. Lewis never suggested that she was not in\npossession of the MDT recommendation or that the\nrecommendation was baseless. Indeed, it could be argued\nthat Lewis had good reason to believe that the MDT's fears\nwere well-founded since Lewis herself approved Hamilton\nfor protective custody on two prior occasions. Moreover,\nsince Lewis should be charged with knowledge of\nHamilton's known cooperation with prison officials and the\nsubsequent branding of Hamilton as a \"snitch,\" appellant's\napp. at 47a, a factfinder could infer that Lewis knew that\nthe threat to Hamilton's safety was imminent.\n\nA prison official's knowledge of a substantial risk is a\nquestion of fact and can, of course, be proved by\ncircumstantial evidence. Id. (\"Whether a prison official had\nthe requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question\nof fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways,\nincluding inference from circumstantial evidence . . . .\"); see\nWallis v. Baldwin, 70 F.3d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir. 1995)\n(existence of circumstantial evidence that prison officials\nwere aware of risk posed to prisoner by asbestos precluded\nsummary judgment). The Farmer Court explained in\nhypothetical terms the type of circumstantial evidence\nsufficient for a finding of actual knowledge on the part of a\nprison official:\n\n                    9\n\fif an Eighth Amendment plaintiff presents evidence\nshowing that a substantial risk of inmate attacks was\n`longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or expressly\nnoted by prison officials in the past,' and the\ncircumstances suggest that the defendant-official being\nsued had been exposed to information concerning the\nrisk and thus `must have known' about it, then such\nevidence could be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to\nfind that the defendant-official had actual knowledge of\nthe risk.\n\nFarmer, 114 S. Ct. at 1981-82.\n\nThe circumstantial evidence of record in this case, which\nis essentially identical to those hypothesized by the Farmer\nCourt, does not appear to have been considered by the\ndistrict court. However, these facts constitute sufficient\ncircumstantial evidence upon which a factfinder could\nconclude that Lewis \"must have known\" of the risk to\nHamilton's safety. Id. See id. at 1981 (\"[A] factfinder may\nconclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk\nfrom the very fact that the risk was obvious.\"). Accordingly,\nbased on the circumstantial evidence offered by Hamilton\nwhich demonstrates the existence of an obvious risk,\nLewis's decision to consciously disregard that risk\n(memorialized by the CICC \"no action\" decision), and\nHamilton's resulting injuries which occurred less than two\nmonths following the CICC's decision to take \"no action,\"\nwe conclude that summary judgment was improper as to\nLewis.\n\nB.\n\nMoreover, the record indicates that the MDT defendants\ntook no immediate action following its recommendation to\nthe CICC that Hamilton should be placed in protective\ncustody. It also took no action after that recommendation\nwas rejected. The district court found that Hamilton's\nEighth Amendment claim could not be maintained against\nthe MDT defendants. It reasoned that because the MDT\ndefendants were without authority to effectuate their own\nrecommendation that Hamilton be placed in protective\ncustody, they could not be found to have deliberately\n\n                    10\n\fdisregarded serious risks to his safety. In other words, the\ncourt found that the MDT's submission of the report to\nLewis amounted to a reasonable response to the risk\nHamilton faced, which would preclude liability against\nthem.\n\nThe Farmer Court specifically noted that\"prison officials\nwho actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or\nsafety may be found free from liability if they responded\nreasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not\naverted.\" Id. at 1982-83. If a prison official responds\nreasonably to a risk to an inmate's safety, he or she cannot\nbe found to have acted with a sufficiently culpable state of\nmind. Id. at 1983 (\"Whether one puts it in terms of duty or\ndeliberate indifference, prison officials who act reasonably\ncannot be found liable under the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause.\"); id. (\"A prison official's duty under\nthe Eighth Amendment is to ensure `reasonable safety.' \")\n(quoting Hellig v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993)). Here,\nwhile it appears that the MDT defendants acted reasonably\nin following the internal prison procedures by\nrecommending to the CICC that Hamilton be placed in\nprotective custody, the reasonableness of their actions\nfollowing the rejection of that recommendation remains a\nquestion.\n\nThe MDT defendants stated in their affidavits that they\n\"did everything they could\" with respect to ensuring\nHamilton's safety when they recommended he be placed in\nprotective custody. But the district court's refusal to\nconsider whether the MDT defendants could have taken\nfurther action failed to give Hamilton the benefit of all\nreasonable inferences, to which he is entitled, as the non-\nmovant. Indeed, Hamilton's counter-argument, asserted in\nhis pro se complaint, is that the MDT defendants could\nhave taken additional steps, such as place him in\nadministrative segregation. Because neither party presented\nconclusive evidence on this issue, there remains a genuine\nissue of material fact regarding whether the MDT's\nresponse to the risk Hamilton faced was reasonable.\nMatshushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,\n475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986) (to survive summary judgment,\nnon-movant must only show more than \"some metaphysical\n\n                    11\n\fdoubt as to the material facts\"); Big Apple BMW, Inc. v.\nBMW of North America, 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992)\n(\"To raise a genuine issue of material fact [the] opponent\nneed not match, item for item, each piece of evidence\nproffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent\nhas exceeded the `mere scintilla' threshold and has offered\na genuine issue of material fact, then the court cannot\ncredit the movant's version of events against the opponent\n. . . .\"); Ely v. Hall's Motor Transit Co., 590 F.2d 62 (3d Cir.\n1978) (any doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact will be resolved against the movant). The\nfailure of the MDT defendants to take additional steps\nbeyond the recommendation of protective custody could be\nviewed by a factfinder as the sort of deliberate indifference\nto inmate safety that the Constitution forbids.\n\nAccordingly, we will reverse the district court's grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the MDT defendants.\n\nV.\n\nHamilton also alleges that the district court erred by\ndenying his request for the appointment of counsel. In\ndenying Hamilton's request, the district court considered\nthe factors we announced in Tabron v. Grace, 6 F.3d 147,\n155-56 (3d Cir. 1993), for determining whether the\nappointment of counsel is warranted. We review the district\ncourt's refusal to appoint counsel to Hamilton for abuse of\ndiscretion. Id. at 155 n.4.\n\nIn Tabron we held that when deciding whether to appoint\ncounsel for indigent litigants, district courts should\nconsider the merits of the plaintiff's claim, the plaintiff's\nability to present his or her case, the difficulty of the legal\nissues, and the degree to which the case will require\nextensive factual investigation or turn on credibility\ndeterminations. Id. at 156.\n\nAfter weighing the various Tabron factors, the district\ncourt concluded that Hamilton could not demonstrate\n\"special circumstances indicat[ing] the likelihood of\nsubstantial prejudice to him resulting . . . from his probable\ninability without such assistance to present the facts and\nlegal issues to the court in a complex but arguably\n\n                     12\n\fmeritorious case.\" Smith-Bey v. Petsock, 741 F.2d 22, 26\n(3d Cir. 1984).\n\nWe are unable to agree with this conclusion for two\nreasons: first, the district court erred in concluding that\nHamilton did not have a colorable claim; second, the record\nindicates that Hamilton may be ill-equipped to represent\nhimself or to litigate this claim inasmuch as there is\nunrebutted medical evidence that he suffers from a\nparanoid delusional disorder. The district court's failure to\nconsider the weight of this fact demonstrates that more\nserious consideration should have been given to Hamilton's\nrequest for the appointment of counsel. We will therefore\nreverse on this issue and remand to the district court with\ninstructions to appoint counsel for Hamilton. See Tucker v.\nRandall, 948 F.2d 388, 391 (7th Cir. 1991) (appointment of\ncounsel appropriate when plaintiff presented colorable\nclaim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs\nresulting in permanent deformities).\n\nVI.\n\nWe do not believe that Hamilton's request for additional\ndiscovery and for leave to amend his complaint require\nextended discussion. The district court denied these\nrequests on the ground that each was a futile attempt to\nsalvage Hamilton's action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. As we\nhave explained above, the district court misconstrued\nFarmer, and Hamilton does have a colorable Eighth\nAmendment claim. We will, therefore, remand this issue to\nthe district court with instructions to permit Hamilton to\npursue full and reasonable discovery as is consistent with\nthe Farmer mandate relating to circumstantial evidence, as\ndescribed above. Because Hamilton's initial discovery\nrequest involved an effort to obtain the names of those\nofficials who were aware of the substantial risk to his\nsafety, and that request was erroneously denied, it is\nappropriate that Hamilton be allowed to amend his\ncomplaint as well.2 Small v. Lehman, 98 F.3d 762 (3d Cir.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Our reversal in this matter renders it unnecessary to reach Hamilton's\ncontention that the district court improperly converted appellees' motion\nto dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) to one of summary judgment.\n\n                    13\n\f1996) (courts should allow liberal amendment of pro se\ncomplaints).\n\nVII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the district\ncourt's order of November 2, 1994, granting summary\njudgment to the MDT defendants. We will also reverse the\ndistrict court's order of May 26, 1995, granting summary\njudgment to Lewis, and remand this case with instructions\nto appoint counsel for Hamilton,3 to permit him to\nundertake discovery and to permit him to amend his\ncomplaint.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\nClerk of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Judge Nygaard would not directly appoint counsel, but, believing that\nthe issue is best addressed by the district court in the first instance,\nwould remand the question for that court to exercise its discretion, as\nrequired by Tabron v.

He alleges that the\nappellees violated his right to be free from cruel and\nunusual punishment, guaranteed by the Eighth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically,\nHamilton claims that these defendants knew of and\ndisregarded an excessive risk to his safety posed by other\ninmates.\n\nThis case requires us to determine whether the district\ncourt misapplied the Supreme Court's decision in Farmer v.\nBrennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We must also determine\nwhether the district court erred when it declined to allow\nHamilton to pursue discovery, denied his request for the\n\n                    2\n\fappointment of counsel and refused to permit him to\namend his complaint to add new defendants.\n\nFor the reasons explained below, we will reverse.\n\nI.\n\nHamilton has a long history of being assaulted\nthroughout the Delaware prison system. He has been\ntransferred out of the State of Delaware twice, and has\nbeen placed in protective custody on numerous occasions.\nWhile an explanation for each of Hamilton's violent clashes\nthroughout the prison system is absent from the record,\nthe fact that Hamilton's safety has been an ongoing concern\nis not in dispute.\n\nThe earliest evidence of violence against Hamilton dates\nback to February 14, 1976. On that day he was stabbed by\na fellow inmate while incarcerated in the Maximum\nSecurity Unit (\"MSU\") at the Delaware Correctional Center\nin Smyrna, Delaware (\"DCC\"). Over a year later, on May 8,\n1977, an inmate attacked Hamilton with a chair in the\nMSU. On August 1, 1977, he was assaulted in the MSU by\ntwenty inmates who stabbed him in the back, stomach and\narms. He also suffered severe lacerations to the head and\nface, which required his hospitalization at the Institution\nHospital at Gander Hill. For his own protection, Hamilton\nremained confined there for four months with no outside\nactivities whatsoever. During that time, Hamilton made an\neffort to return to the MSU, but due to threats by other\ninmates, he was placed in protective custody pursuant to\nthe \"Inmates Rule (31) Emergency Provisions\" procedure.\nAppellant's app. at 44a. Hamilton was later transferred out\nof the Delaware state prison system entirely and was held\nin federal custody in Leavenworth, Kansas. The stated\nreasons for Hamilton's transfer were to alleviate\novercrowding and because \"[Hamilton] had been assaulted\nand stabbed at the DCC and the staff feared for his safety.\"\nId. at 27a.\n\nAt some point between 1982 and 1984, Hamilton was\nreturned from federal custody to the custody of the State of\nDelaware, where he was again incarcerated at Gander Hill.\nThe assaults continued. On March 25, 1985, he was\n\n                    3\n\ftransferred to the general prison population at Sussex\nCorrectional Institution in Georgetown, Delaware. There, he\neventually notified officials that his \"life was in danger\" and\nthat he would \"be killed\" if he remained there. Prison\nofficials believed him. The following week, they\nrecommended that he be placed in protective custody back\nat Gander Hill. Hamilton was later transferred, on April 11,\n1986, from Gander Hill to DCC. Hamilton was informed\nthat the reason for his transfer was that \"it [was] felt that\n[he] may be in danger of physical harm should [he]\ncontinue to be housed [at Gander Hill].\" Id. at 17a. In a\ndocument prepared by a member of the MDT, it was\nexplained that \"[Hamilton] was moved because he required\nprotective custody in a more secure setting in that his life\nwas in danger at [Gander Hill].\" Id. at 47a. On May 21,\n1986, Hamilton was placed in protective custody at DCC.\n\nFor reasons not apparent from the record, and despite\nthe serious concerns described above, Hamilton was again\nreturned to Gander Hill at some point in 1986. At that\ntime, Hamilton cooperated with an official investigation of\ndrug trafficking that led to the arrest of officers and\ninmates at Gander Hill. Not surprisingly, Hamilton was\nthen labeled \"a snitch\" within certain circles of the prison\npopulation. Id. at 10a. This latest development required\nnumerous transfers of Hamilton into protective custody.\nFrances Lewis, CICC Chairperson, personally approved\ntransfers on November 16, 1988 and February 8, 1989, and\nHamilton was recommended for protective custody again on\nMay 11, 1989. Even up until November 30, 1989, the MDT\nacknowledged that Hamilton's need for protective custody\nhad not changed. In fact, while Hamilton was still in\nprotective custody at Gander Hill, the MDT recommended\non August 17, 1990, that he be transferred \"out of the\nbuilding\" to protective custody at another location. Id. at\n29a. Because there appeared to be no safe place for\nHamilton in the Delaware prisons, on September 4, 1990,\nprison officials decided that Hamilton would be transferred\nto Virginia to ensure his safety. Id. at 18a.\n\nOn December 12, 1991, Hamilton was temporarily\nreturned from Virginia to Gander Hill for the purpose of\nprosecuting two civil actions in the Delaware courts, one of\n\n                    4\n\fwhich was an action against Delaware prison officials.\nConcern for Hamilton's safety was again triggered, when,\non March 25, 1992, in a room at Gander Hill with several\ninmates present, a guard called Hamilton \"a good telling\nmother f_____g snitcher.\" Id. at 25a. A committee appointed\nto investigate this incident, apparently recognizing the risk\nto Hamilton's safety, concluded that \"comments of this\nnature [have] the potential of a major disturbance and\nrequires immediate action.\" Id. at 24a. The guard who made\nthe statement was later reprimanded.\n\nOn June 18, 1992, Levy, Faulkner and Queener\nconvened a MDT meeting at Gander Hill to review\nHamilton's security classification and consider his request\nto be placed in protective custody. The MDT made an\nadministrative summary of the reasons for Hamilton's\nearlier transfer to Virginia and for his return to Delaware.\nAfter reviewing Hamilton's history of being assaulted in\nprison, the MDT unanimously recommended that Hamilton\nbe placed in protective custody. But despite their own\nrecommendation, the MDT took no immediate action to\nprotect Hamilton. The MDT's report and recommendation\nwere forwarded to the CICC, chaired by Lewis. The CICC\nthereafter made a unanimous determination to take\"no\naction.\"\n\nConsequently, Hamilton remained in the general\npopulation. Less than two months following the CICC's \"no\naction\" determination, on August 5, 1992, Hamilton was\nassaulted by another prisoner. The prisoner who pleaded\nguilty to the assault stated that he committed the offense\nbecause Hamilton was \"a snitcher on inmates and officers\nat [Gander Hill].\" Appellant's br. at 22. As a result of the\nassault, Hamilton required surgery to repair two jaw\nfractures and currently has two metal plates in his both\nsides of his jaw.\n\nHamilton thereafter filed suit in district court, claiming\nthat prison officials violated state prison regulations and\nshowed a deliberate indifference to his safety, thereby\nviolating his constitutional right under the Eighth\nAmendment to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n                   5\n\fII.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of\nthe MDT defendants on the ground that they recommended\nthat Hamilton be placed in protective custody, and were\nwithout authority to effectuate that recommendation. The\ndistrict court also granted summary judgment in Lewis's\nfavor on the ground that the facts did not establish that\nshe was aware of the risk to Hamilton, and that a\nreasonable factfinder could not find otherwise. This appeal\nfollowed.\n\nThe district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nยงยง 1331 and 1342. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. ยง 1291.

Accordingly, \"[a] prison official's deliberate\nindifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to an\ninmate violates the Eighth Amendment.\" Id., at 1974.\n\nFor an inmate to prevail on an Eighth Amendment\nfailure-to-protect claim, two requirements must be met.\nFirst, the prisoner must demonstrate \"that he is\nincarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of\nserious harm.\" Id. at 1977. This element is satisfied when\nthe alleged \"punishment\" is \"objectively sufficiently\nserious.\" Id. Second, the prison officials involved must have\na sufficiently culpable state of mind. Id. at 1979 (\"[O]ur\ncases mandate inquiry into a prison official's state of mind\nwhen it is claimed that the official has inflicted cruel and\nunusual punishment.\"). Specifically, the inmate must show\nthat the official \"knows of and disregards an excessive risk\nto inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware\nof facts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exists, and [s]he must also\ndraw the inference.\" Id.\n\nConsequently, to survive summary judgment on an\nEighth Amendment claim asserted under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983,\na plaintiff is required to produce sufficient evidence of (1) a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm; (2) the defendants'\ndeliberate indifference to that risk; and (3) causation.\nLaMarca v. Turner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609212\"><a href=\"/opinion/609212/anthony-lamarca-martin-saunders-and-edwin-johnson-individually-and-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1535 (11th Cir. 1993).\n\nIV.\n\nA.\n\nIn its grant of summary judgment in favor of Lewis, the\ndistrict court found \"no credible evidence of record that\n[Hamilton] faced a substantial risk of serious harm from\nany inmate during his temporary classification to the\ngeneral population [at Gander Hill], or that [Lewis] had\nknowledge of such so as to justify characterizing her June\n24, 1992 classification decision as the infliction of\npunishment.\" Dist. ct. op. at 7.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the district court relied\nprimarily on Lewis's affidavit in which she explains her\n\n                    7\n\frefusal to place Hamilton in protective custody despite the\nMDT's recommendation to provide him with such\nprotection. She claimed that \"Hamilton was kept at [Gander\nHill] because there was no evidence of a problem there.\"\nShe further commented that \"[i]f valid evidence of a danger\nto plaintiff existed at [Gander Hill], the Committee would\nhave classified him appropriately.\" The district court\nconsidered Lewis's affidavit conclusive in determining that\nno material issues of fact existed for resolution at trial. Our\nreview of the record brings us to the opposite conclusion.\n\nThe district court erred in failing to acknowledge the\nMDT's recommendation that Hamilton should be placed in\nprotective custody as evidence that he faced a substantial\nrisk of serious harm. The MDT members, on June 18,\n1992, considered Hamilton's history of violent clashes\nthroughout the Delaware prison system, and acknowledged\nhis statement that \"protective custody concerns exist\nthroughout the state.\"1 The MDT members then concluded,\nunanimously, that Hamilton was in such danger as to\njustify isolating him from the general population in\nprotective custody. Because there is no indication in the\nrecord that the MDT's recommendation was unwarranted or\none-sided, we see no basis for the district court's\nconclusion that there was no evidence that Hamilton faced\na substantial risk of serious harm.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The district court concluded that Hamilton failed to initiate the\nclassification review proceeding in June, 1992, and that this militated\nagainst a finding of deliberate indifference on the part of Lewis. However,\nthe MDT Memorandum reveals that Hamilton did \"claim that the\nprotective custody concerns still exist throughout the state.\" Appellant's\napp. at 11a. We note that the district court's reasoning suggesting that\nHamilton was required to give advance notice of his safety concerns is\ninconsistent with the teachings of Farmer. There, while the plaintiff\nvoiced no concern about his placement in the general population where\nhe was assaulted, this fact was insufficient to support a grant of\nsummary judgment for the defendants. Farmer, 114 S. Ct. at 1984-85\n(\"[T]he District Court may have mistakenly thought that advance notice\nwas a necessary element of an Eighth Amendment claim. . . .\").\nAccordingly, in this case, the question of who initiated the June 18,\n1992 classification review will have no bearing on the question of Lewis's\nawareness of the risk posed to Hamilton.\n\n                    8\n\fYet, a showing that there was an excessive risk to\nHamilton's safety is alone insufficient to preclude summary\njudgment. Hamilton must also show that the harm he\nsuffered was caused by a prison official's deliberate\nindifference to his safety. Deliberate indifference can be\nshown when \"a prison official knows of and disregards an\nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety.\" Farmer, 114 S.\nCt. at 1979. We are therefore required to \"focus[on] what\na defendant's mental attitude actually was (or is), rather\nthan what it should have been (or should be).\" Id. at 1980.\nThe Court believed this subjective approach to be\nappropriate because it \"isolates those who inflict\npunishment.\" Id.\n\nIn this case, Lewis was made aware of a substantial risk\nto Hamilton's safety when she reviewed the MDT's\nunanimous recommendation to place Hamilton in protective\ncustody. Lewis never suggested that she was not in\npossession of the MDT recommendation or that the\nrecommendation was baseless. Indeed, it could be argued\nthat Lewis had good reason to believe that the MDT's fears\nwere well-founded since Lewis herself approved Hamilton\nfor protective custody on two prior occasions. Moreover,\nsince Lewis should be charged with knowledge of\nHamilton's known cooperation with prison officials and the\nsubsequent branding of Hamilton as a \"snitch,\" appellant's\napp. at 47a, a factfinder could infer that Lewis knew that\nthe threat to Hamilton's safety was imminent.\n\nA prison official's knowledge of a substantial risk is a\nquestion of fact and can, of course, be proved by\ncircumstantial evidence. Id. (\"Whether a prison official had\nthe requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question\nof fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways,\nincluding inference from circumstantial evidence . . . .\"); see\nWallis v. Baldwin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708225\"><a href=\"/opinion/708225/95-cal-daily-op-serv-8809-95-daily-journal-dar-15420-clarence/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1074</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1077 (9th Cir. 1995)\n(existence of circumstantial evidence that prison officials\nwere aware of risk posed to prisoner by asbestos precluded\nsummary judgment). The Farmer Court explained in\nhypothetical terms the type of circumstantial evidence\nsufficient for a finding of actual knowledge on the part of a\nprison official:\n\n                    9\n\fif an Eighth Amendment plaintiff presents evidence\nshowing that a substantial risk of inmate attacks was\n`longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or expressly\nnoted by prison officials in the past,' and the\ncircumstances suggest that the defendant-official being\nsued had been exposed to information concerning the\nrisk and thus `must have known' about it, then such\nevidence could be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to\nfind that the defendant-official had actual knowledge of\nthe risk.\n\nFarmer, 114 S. Ct. at 1981-82.\n\nThe circumstantial evidence of record in this case, which\nis essentially identical to those hypothesized by the Farmer\nCourt, does not appear to have been considered by the\ndistrict court. However, these facts constitute sufficient\ncircumstantial evidence upon which a factfinder could\nconclude that Lewis \"must have known\" of the risk to\nHamilton's safety. Id. See id. at 1981 (\"[A] factfinder may\nconclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk\nfrom the very fact that the risk was obvious.\"). Accordingly,\nbased on the circumstantial evidence offered by Hamilton\nwhich demonstrates the existence of an obvious risk,\nLewis's decision to consciously disregard that risk\n(memorialized by the CICC \"no action\" decision), and\nHamilton's resulting injuries which occurred less than two\nmonths following the CICC's decision to take \"no action,\"\nwe conclude that summary judgment was improper as to\nLewis.\n\nB.\n\nMoreover, the record indicates that the MDT defendants\ntook no immediate action following its recommendation to\nthe CICC that Hamilton should be placed in protective\ncustody. It also took no action after that recommendation\nwas rejected. The district court found that Hamilton's\nEighth Amendment claim could not be maintained against\nthe MDT defendants. It reasoned that because the MDT\ndefendants were without authority to effectuate their own\nrecommendation that Hamilton be placed in protective\ncustody, they could not be found to have deliberately\n\n                    10\n\fdisregarded serious risks to his safety. In other words, the\ncourt found that the MDT's submission of the report to\nLewis amounted to a reasonable response to the risk\nHamilton faced, which would preclude liability against\nthem.\n\nThe Farmer Court specifically noted that\"prison officials\nwho actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or\nsafety may be found free from liability if they responded\nreasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not\naverted.\" Id. at 1982-83. If a prison official responds\nreasonably to a risk to an inmate's safety, he or she cannot\nbe found to have acted with a sufficiently culpable state of\nmind. Id. at 1983 (\"Whether one puts it in terms of duty or\ndeliberate indifference, prison officials who act reasonably\ncannot be found liable under the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause.\"); id. (\"A prison official's duty under\nthe Eighth Amendment is to ensure `reasonable safety.' \")\n(quoting Hellig v.

Here,\nwhile it appears that the MDT defendants acted reasonably\nin following the internal prison procedures by\nrecommending to the CICC that Hamilton be placed in\nprotective custody, the reasonableness of their actions\nfollowing the rejection of that recommendation remains a\nquestion.\n\nThe MDT defendants stated in their affidavits that they\n\"did everything they could\" with respect to ensuring\nHamilton's safety when they recommended he be placed in\nprotective custody. But the district court's refusal to\nconsider whether the MDT defendants could have taken\nfurther action failed to give Hamilton the benefit of all\nreasonable inferences, to which he is entitled, as the non-\nmovant. Indeed, Hamilton's counter-argument, asserted in\nhis pro se complaint, is that the MDT defendants could\nhave taken additional steps, such as place him in\nadministrative segregation. Because neither party presented\nconclusive evidence on this issue, there remains a genuine\nissue of material fact regarding whether the MDT's\nresponse to the risk Hamilton faced was reasonable.\nMatshushita Electric Industrial Co. v.

In\ndenying Hamilton's request, the district court considered\nthe factors we announced in Tabron v. Grace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654205\"><a href=\"/opinion/654205/harvey-tabron-v-lt-grace-lieutenant-major-price-correct-officer-gross/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n155-56 (3d Cir. 1993), for determining whether the\nappointment of counsel is warranted. We review the district\ncourt's refusal to appoint counsel to Hamilton for abuse of\ndiscretion. Id. at 155 n.4.\n\nIn Tabron we held that when deciding whether to appoint\ncounsel for indigent litigants, district courts should\nconsider the merits of the plaintiff's claim, the plaintiff's\nability to present his or her case, the difficulty of the legal\nissues, and the degree to which the case will require\nextensive factual investigation or turn on credibility\ndeterminations. Id. at 156.\n\nAfter weighing the various Tabron factors, the district\ncourt concluded that Hamilton could not demonstrate\n\"special circumstances indicat[ing] the likelihood of\nsubstantial prejudice to him resulting . . . from his probable\ninability without such assistance to present the facts and\nlegal issues to the court in a complex but arguably\n\n                     12\n\fmeritorious case.\" Smith-Bey v.

The district court's failure to\nconsider the weight of this fact demonstrates that more\nserious consideration should have been given to Hamilton's\nrequest for the appointment of counsel. We will therefore\nreverse on this issue and remand to the district court with\ninstructions to appoint counsel for Hamilton. See Tucker v.\nRandall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571306\"><a href=\"/opinion/571306/billy-b-tucker-v-sheriff-randall-and-lieutenant-speenburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (7th Cir. 1991) (appointment of\ncounsel appropriate when plaintiff presented colorable\nclaim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs\nresulting in permanent deformities).\n\nVI.\n\nWe do not believe that Hamilton's request for additional\ndiscovery and for leave to amend his complaint require\nextended discussion. The district court denied these\nrequests on the ground that each was a futile attempt to\nsalvage Hamilton's action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. As we\nhave explained above, the district court misconstrued\nFarmer, and Hamilton does have a colorable Eighth\nAmendment claim. We will, therefore, remand this issue to\nthe district court with instructions to permit Hamilton to\npursue full and reasonable discovery as is consistent with\nthe Farmer mandate relating to circumstantial evidence, as\ndescribed above. Because Hamilton's initial discovery\nrequest involved an effort to obtain the names of those\nofficials who were aware of the substantial risk to his\nsafety, and that request was erroneously denied, it is\nappropriate that Hamilton be allowed to amend his\ncomplaint as well.2 Small v.
