Reinhard, Judge.\n\n\nSubmitted July 14, 1999/*--Decided August 11, 2000\n\n\n\n  Before HARLINGTON WOOD, JR., COFFEY and RIPPLE, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n  RIPPLE, Circuit Judge. Anthony DeWalt, an\nIllinois prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks\ncompensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 1983 against five individuals employed at\nthe Dixon Correctional Center (\"Dixon\") for\nalleged violations of his First, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendment rights. Mr. DeWalt claims\nthat various defendants used racially insulting\nand sexually explicit language when speaking to\nhim, engaged in a racially motivated and\nretaliatory conspiracy to get him fired from his\nprison job, retaliated against him in a variety\nof other ways for filing a grievance against a\nprison guard, used excessive force in illegally\npunishing him, and ignored his complaints of\ndiscrimination and retaliation. The district\ncourt dismissed Mr. DeWalt’s complaint for\nfailure to state a claim. We affirm in part and\nreverse in part.\n\nI\nBACKGROUND\n  Anthony DeWalt’s problems at Dixon began on\nAugust 8, 1997, when Correctional Officer Young,\na prison guard, approached him while he was\nworking at his job cleaning the building that\nhouses the prison school./1 Officer Young made a\nseries of sexually suggestive and racially\n\fderogatory comments to him regarding certain\nfemale teachers at the prison school. Mr. DeWalt\nfiled a grievance against Officer Young based on\nthe incident. Mr. DeWalt’s decision to file the\ngrievance set off a wave of retaliation by the\ndefendants and other prison employees.\n\n  During the following week, Officer Young went to\nCarol Biester, an administrator at the prison\nschool, and suggested to her that Mr. DeWalt was\ntrying to initiate an intimate relationship with\na teacher at the prison school. Ms. Biester, in\nresponse, instructed Mr. DeWalt in an abrasive\nand insulting manner not to enter the teacher’s\nclassroom.\n\n  Shortly thereafter, on August 14, Officer Young\nordered Mr. DeWalt to clean the teacher’s\nclassroom, and Mr. DeWalt did so. Officer Young,\nhowever, submitted a disciplinary report charging\nMr. DeWalt with entering the classroom in\ncontravention of Ms. Biester’s orders. Based on\nOfficer Young’s disciplinary report, Ms. Biester\nremoved Mr. DeWalt from his job. Mr. DeWalt\nchallenged Officer Young’s disciplinary report\ninternally, but the prison’s Adjustment Committee\nfound Mr. DeWalt guilty of the disciplinary\nviolation on August 26, 1997. As a result, Mr.\nDeWalt was permanently reassigned from his job at\nthe prison school.\n\n  At about the same time Mr. DeWalt lost his\nprison job, Dan Murray, a prison administrator,\ntook him aside, informed him that he had heard\nOfficer Young’s allegations about Mr. DeWalt’s\ninterest in the teacher, and proceeded to berate\nMr. DeWalt in racially derogatory terms for\ngetting into trouble and for pursuing prison\nteachers. Several weeks later, Mr. Murray refused\nto reassign Mr. DeWalt to a new prison job,\ndespite the warden’s instructions to do so.\n\n  Over the next few weeks, Mr. DeWalt received two\nmore groundless disciplinary reports from other\nprison staff members who are not defendants in\nthe present case. The prison guard who gave Mr.\nDeWalt the second of these reports informed Mr.\nDeWalt that Ms. Biester and Officer Young had\nenlisted a number of prison staff members to give\nMr. DeWalt disciplinary reports whenever possible\nbecause Mr. DeWalt had filed a grievance against\nOfficer Young.\n\n  Finally, in early November 1997, Correctional\nOfficer Smith, another prison guard, issued Mr.\nDeWalt a disciplinary report. He informed Mr.\nDeWalt that he was receiving the disciplinary\nreport because he had filed a grievance against\nOfficer Young and because correctional officers\n\"stick together.\" R.11. As Mr. DeWalt walked\n\faway, he told Officer Smith that his actions were\nunprofessional, whereupon Officer Smith jumped up\nand shoved Mr. DeWalt toward the doorway and into\nthe door frame. Mr. DeWalt suffered bruising on\nhis back where he hit the door frame; the prison\nmedical staff, however, did not note any visible\ninjury and did not order X-rays.\n\n  Throughout this time period, Mr. DeWalt wrote\nseveral letters to Dixon’s warden, Lamark Carter,\ncomplaining about several of the incidents\ndescribed above. Mr. Carter offered Mr. DeWalt a\njob in another part of the prison; however, it\nappears that Mr. Carter took no other actions.\n\n  Liberally construed, see Hudson v. McHugh, 148\nF.3d 859, 864 (7th Cir. 1998), Mr. DeWalt’s\ncomplaint alleges the following claims: (1) that\nOfficer Young and Mr. Murray violated the Eighth\nand Fourteenth Amendments by using racial\nepithets and making racially derogatory and\nsexually explicit statements when speaking to Mr.\nDeWalt; (2) that Officer Young, acting alone and\nin conspiracy with Ms. Biester, violated the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments by taking various\nactions to have Mr. DeWalt removed from his job\nat the prison school because of his race and\nbecause he had filed a grievance against Officer\nYoung; (3) that Officer Young, Ms. Biester, and\nOfficer Smith violated the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments by retaliating against Mr. DeWalt for\ncomplaining about Officer Young’s actions; (4)\nthat Officer Smith violated the Eighth Amendment\nby using excessive force to impose illegal\npunishment; (5) that Mr. Carter violated the\nFirst, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments by\nfailing to remedy or prevent the allegedly\nillegal actions taken by Officer Young, Ms.\nBiester, and Mr. Murray; and (6) that Officer\nSmith violated the Fourteenth Amendment by\nfabricating disciplinary charges. The district\ncourt, addressing some but not all these claims,\ndismissed Mr. DeWalt’s complaint sua sponte in\nits entirety under 28 U.S.C. sec.\n1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim.\nMr. DeWalt now appeals./2\n\nII\nANALYSIS\nA. Standard of Review\n\n  This court has not yet identified the proper\nstandard of review for dismissals under 28 U.S.C.\nsec. 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), which provides that a\ndistrict court must dismiss the case of a\nplaintiff proceeding in forma pauperis if the\naction \"fails to state a claim on which relief\nmay be granted.\" See Mathis v. New York Life Ins.\nCo., 133 F.3d 546, 547 (7th Cir. 1998) (per\ncuriam) (noting that the question of the proper\n\fstandard of review is an open one in this\ncircuit). It is well-established, however, that\nwe review de novo dismissals for failure to state\na claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6). We see no reason to treat dismissals\nunder sec. 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) differently. Cf.\nSanders v. Sheahan, 198 F.3d 626, 626 (7th Cir.\n1999) (reaching the same conclusion with respect\nto dismissals for failure to state a claim under\n28 U.S.C. sec. 1915A(b)(1)). Moreover, the\ncircuits that have addressed this issue agree\nthat de novo review is the proper standard of\nreview. See Perkins v. Kansas Dep’t of\nCorrections, 165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir. 1999);\nBarren v. Harrington, 152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th\nCir. 1998) (per curiam), cert. denied, 525 U.S.\n1154 (1999); McGore v. Wrigglesworth, 114 F.3d\n601, 604 (6th Cir. 1997); Mitchell v. Farcass,\n112 F.3d 1483, 1486 (11th Cir. 1997).\nAccordingly, we conclude that dismissals under\nsec. 1915(e) (2)(B)(ii) will be reviewed de novo\nin the same manner as dismissals under Rule\n12(b)(6).\n\n  In evaluating whether a plaintiff’s complaint\nfails to state a claim, a court must take the\nplaintiff’s factual allegations as true and draw\nall reasonable inferences in his favor. See\nStrasburger v. Board of Educ., 143 F.3d 351, 359\n(7th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1069\n(1999). A complaint should be dismissed for\nfailure to state a claim only if \"no relief could\nbe granted ’under any set of facts that could be\nproved consistent with the allegations.’\" Nance\nv. Vieregge, 147 F.3d 589, 590 (7th Cir.)\n(quoting Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69,\n73 (1984)), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 973 (1998).\nAccordingly, a plaintiff need not plead\nparticular legal theories or particular facts in\norder to state a claim. See Bennett v. Schmidt,\n153 F.3d 516, 518-19 (7th Cir. 1998); Nance, 147\nF.3d at 590. All that is required is \"a short and\nplain statement of the claim that will give the\ndefendant fair notice of what the plaintiff’s\nclaim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\"\nLeatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics\nIntelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163,\n168 (1993) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); Kyle\nv. Morton High Sch., 144 F.3d 448, 454 (7th Cir.\n1998).\n\nB. Racist and Sexually Explicit\nStatements\n\n  Although the district court did not address\nspecifically Mr. DeWalt’s allegations concerning\nOfficer Young’s and Mr. Murray’s use of sexually\nexplicit language, the district court did explain\nits rejection of Mr. DeWalt’s claim regarding\n\ftheir use of racially derogatory language. The\ncourt reasoned that such language does not\ndeprive a person of any constitutionally\nprotected rights.\n\n  Precedent from this circuit as well as others\nsupports the district court’s conclusion. The use\nof racially derogatory language, while\nunprofessional and deplorable, does not violate\nthe Constitution. See Patton v. Przybylski, 822\nF.2d 697, 700 (7th Cir. 1987); accord Williams v.\nBramer, 180 F.3d 699, 706 (5th Cir.), clarified\non rehearing, 186 F.3d 633 (5th Cir. 1999).\nStanding alone, simple verbal harassment does not\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment, deprive\na prisoner of a protected liberty interest or\ndeny a prisoner equal protection of the laws./3\nSee Ivey v. Wilson, 832 F.2d 950, 955 (6th Cir.\n1987) (per curiam) (Eighth Amendment); Patton,\n822 F.2d at 700 (due process); Williams, 180 F.3d\nat 705-06 (equal protection). See generally\nShabazz v. Cole, 69 F. Supp. 2d 177, 199-201 (D.\nMass. 1999) (collecting cases). Accordingly, Mr.\nDeWalt’s claims that Officer Young and Mr. Murray\nviolated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights by directing racially derogatory and\nsexually explicit language at him were properly\ndismissed.\n\nC.  Removal of Mr. DeWalt from his Job\n  The district court rejected Mr. DeWalt’s claim\nconcerning the loss of his job at the prison\nschool on two grounds. First, the court noted\nthat Illinois prisoners have no right to hold a\nparticular prison job, or any job at all for that\nmatter. It concluded, therefore, that Mr. DeWalt\ncould not base a sec. 1983 claim on the loss of\nhis prison job. Alternatively, the district court\nheld that Mr. DeWalt could not pursue a sec. 1983\ndamages claim based on the loss of his prison job\nbecause Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641 (1997),\nprecludes damages actions challenging\ndisciplinary sanctions that have not been\noverturned through some other means.\n\n1.\n\n  In ruling that Mr. DeWalt could not base a sec.\n1983 claim on the loss of a job to which he had\nno entitlement, the district court collapsed an\nimportant distinction between procedural due\nprocess claims and other sorts of constitutional\nclaims. To establish a procedural due process\nviolation, a prisoner must demonstrate that the\nstate deprived him of a liberty or property\ninterest created either by state law or the Due\nProcess Clause itself. See Sandin v. Conner, 515\nU.S. 472, 483-84 (1995) (summarizing Supreme\nCourt precedent on procedural due process claims\nby prisoners); Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491-\n\f94 (1980) (recognizing liberty interest arising\ndirectly from Due Process Clause); Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555-57 (1974)\n(recognizing that prisoners might enjoy\nprocedural due process protections and that state\nlaw could create protected liberty interests);\nBoard of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576-77\n(1972) (discussing the property interest\nrequirement for procedural due process claims).\nAs the district court recognized, this court, in\nWallace v. Robinson, 940 F.2d 243 (7th Cir. 1991)\n(en banc), determined that neither Illinois law\nnor the Due Process Clause itself affords\nprisoners a liberty or property interest in their\njobs. Accordingly, to the extent that Mr. DeWalt\nalleges a procedural due process claim, the\ndistrict court was correct to dismiss the claim.\n\n  Mr. DeWalt alleges more than a procedural due\nprocess claim, however. He also alleges a\nFourteenth Amendment equal protection claim and a\nFirst Amendment retaliation claim, to which the\nliberty/property interest requirement for\nprocedural due process claims does not apply. See\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 487 n.11; Higgason v. Farley,\n83 F.3d 807, 810 (7th Cir. 1996) (per curiam).\nFor example, if prison officials were to allocate\nT.V. time, visitation privileges, prison jobs, or\nany of the other privileges prisoners enjoy, on\nan otherwise illegal or discriminatory basis,\ntheir actions would be unconstitutional even\nthough such privileges do not constitute liberty\nor property interests. See, e.g., Babcock v.\nWhite, 102 F.3d 267, 274-75 (7th Cir. 1996)\n(retaliatory transfer); Black v. Lane, 824 F.2d\n561, 562 (7th Cir. 1987) (racial discrimination\nwith respect to prison job); Bentley v. Beck, 625\nF.2d 70, 70-71 (5th Cir. Unit B 1980) (per\ncuriam) (same). Accordingly, the fact that Mr.\nDeWalt does not have a liberty or property\ninterest in his former prison job does not\nforeclose his equal protection and retaliation\nclaims arising from the loss of that job.\n\n2.\n\n  Thus, we are faced squarely with the issue\nwhether Mr. DeWalt may bring his sec. 1983 action\n(based on his equal protection and retaliation\nclaims) when the underlying disciplinary sanction\nhas not been overturned or invalidated. Today, we\njoin the Second Circuit and hold that a prisoner\nmay bring a sec. 1983 claim \"challenging the\nconditions of [his] confinement where [he] is\nunable to challenge the conditions through a\npetition for federal habeas corpus.\" Jenkins v.\nHaubert, 179 F.3d 19, 21 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\na.   Statutory framework\n\f  Because Mr. DeWalt’s claim involves both sec.\n1983 and the federal habeas statute, we begin our\nanalysis by looking at both statutes. Section\n1983 provides:\n\nEvery person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any\nState or Territory or the District of Columbia,\nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen\nof the United States or other person within the\njurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any\nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to the\nparty injured in any action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress .\n. . .\n\n42 U.S.C. sec. 1983. By its terms, sec. 1983 does\nnot require a plaintiff to exhaust state remedies\nbefore bringing a cause of action. This\nrequirement, however, was imposed statutorily for\nprisoners in 1996, when Congress enacted the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"). That Act\nprohibits a prisoner from bringing a sec. 1983\naction \"until such administrative remedies as are\navailable are exhausted.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n1997e(a).\n\n  The federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. sec. 2254,\nprovides an avenue to challenge unconstitutional\nconfinement by state authorities. It states in\nrelevant part:\n\n  (a) The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a\ncircuit judge, or a district court shall\nentertain an application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant\nto the judgment of a State court only on the\nground that he is in custody in violation of the\nConstitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates.\n\n  (b)(1) An application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant\nto the judgment of a State court shall not be\ngranted unless it appears that--\n\n  (A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies\navailable in the courts of the State; or\n\n  (B)(i) there is an absence of available State\ncorrective process; or\n\n  (ii) circumstances exist that render such\nprocess ineffective to protect the rights of the\napplicant.\n\n28 U.S.C. sec. 2254.\n\n  A tension between these two statutes arises when\n\fa prisoner, one \"in custody,\" challenges an\naspect of his confinement not through the tool of\nhabeas corpus, but through a sec. 1983 action,\neither for injunctive relief or damages. Because\nthe statutes do not address their overlap and\nresulting conflict, the task of discerning\ncongressional intent has fallen on the courts. We\nturn now to that case law.\n\nb.   Supreme Court case law\n\n  The Supreme Court first considered whether sec.\n1983 could be used to bring actions relating to a\nplaintiff’s conviction or sentence in Preiser v.\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973). In Preiser,\nseveral prisoners sought injunctive relief under\nsec. 1983 to have restored good time credits that\nthey had lost as a result of a prison\ndisciplinary action. The Court concluded that\nsec. 1983 could not be used to pursue such relief\nbecause Congress had designated the federal\nhabeas statute as the exclusive federal remedy\nfor state prisoners who challenge the fact or\nduration of their confinement and seek immediate\nor speedier release. See id. at 489-90.\n\"Congress,\" it stated, \"has determined that\nhabeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state\nprisoners attacking the validity of the fact or\nlength of their confinement, and that specific\ndetermination must override the general terms of\nsec. 1983.\" Id. at 490. The Court also clarified\nwhen sec. 1983 relief would be available to\nprisoners: \"[A] sec. 1983 action is a proper\nremedy for a state prisoner who is making a\nconstitutional challenge to the conditions of his\nprison life, but not to the fact or length of his\ncustody.\" Id. at 499.\n\n  Just over twenty years later, in Heck v.\nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), the Supreme Court\ntook up a question left unanswered by Preiser:\nwhether a plaintiff may bring a sec. 1983 claim\nfor damages that challenges the underlying\nconviction or sentence. The Court analogized such\nclaims to malicious prosecution actions and\nopined that a sec. 1983 action should not be\navailable to challenge a conviction or sentence\nunless the conviction or sentence already has\nbeen invalidated. See id. at 484-87. Accordingly,\nthe Court held:\n\n[I]n order to recover damages for allegedly\nunconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or\nfor other harm caused by actions whose\nunlawfulness would render a conviction or\nsentence invalid, a sec. 1983 plaintiff must\nprove that the conviction or sentence has been\nreversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive\norder, declared invalid by a state tribunal\nauthorized to make such determination, or called\n\finto question by a federal court’s issuance of a\nwrit of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. sec. 2254. A\nclaim for damages bearing that relationship to a\nconviction or sentence that has not been so\ninvalidated is not cognizable under sec. 1983.\n\nId. at 486-87 (footnote omitted).\n\n  In his concurring opinion, Justice Souter noted\nthe difficulty presented by such a broad reading\nof Heck. However, he concluded that the Court’s\nopinion could be read \"as saying nothing more\nthan that now, after enactment of the habeas\nstatute and because of it, prison inmates seeking\nsec. 1983 damages in federal court for\nunconstitutional conviction or confinement must\nsatisfy a requirement analogous to the malicious-\nprosecution tort’s favorable-termination\nrequirement.\" 512 U.S. at 500. \"That,\" continued\nJustice Souter,\n\nwould be a sensible way to read the opinion, in\npart because the alternative would needlessly\nplace at risk the rights of those outside the\nintersection of sec. 1983 and the habeas statute,\nindividuals not \"in custody\" for habeas purposes.\nIf these individuals . . . were required to show\nthe prior invalidation of their convictions or\nsentences in order to obtain sec. 1983 damages\nfor unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,\nthe result would be to deny any federal forum for\nclaiming a deprivation of federal rights to those\nwho cannot first obtain a favorable state ruling.\nThe reason, of course, is that individuals not\n\"in custody\" cannot invoke federal habeas\njurisdiction, the only statutory mechanism\nbesides sec. 1983 by which individuals may sue\nstate officials in federal court for violating\nfederal rights. That would be an untoward result.\n\nId./4\n\n  Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641 (1997),\nextended the Heck rule to sec. 1983 damages\nclaims challenging the loss of good time credits\nin prison disciplinary actions (when the fact or\nduration of confinement was implicated). Making\nno distinction between claims challenging a\nconviction or sentence and claims challenging\nprison disciplinary decisions, the Court\nconcluded that a state prisoner’s claim for\ndamages based on allegations that necessarily\nimplied the invalidity of the punishment imposed\n(i.e., loss of good time credits) was not\ncognizable under sec. 1983 because the prison\ndisciplinary decision had not been invalidated.\nSee id. at 648.\n\n  Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1 (1998), is the\nSupreme Court’s most recent pronouncement in this\n\farena. In that case, the Court ruled that the\nexpiration of a habeas petitioner’s sentence\nrendered moot a challenge to the revocation of\nhis parole since the action no longer presented\nan Article III case or controversy. Concerned\nwith the fact that, as a consequence of the\nCourt’s ruling, the petitioner may have lacked a\nremedy for any unconstitutional actions taken in\nrevoking his parole, the concurring and\ndissenting Justices in Spencer took the\nopportunity to clarify their positions regarding\nthe scope of the Heck rule. Justice Souter,\njoined by Justices O’Connor, Ginsburg, and\nBreyer, wrote: \"The better view, then, is that a\nformer prisoner, no longer ’in custody,’ may\nbring a sec. 1983 action establishing the\nunconstitutionality of a conviction or\nconfinement without being bound to satisfy a\nfavorable-termination requirement that it would\nbe impossible as a matter of law for him to\nsatisfy.\" Id. at 990 (Souter, J., concurring).\nJustice Ginsburg reiterated her agreement in her\nseparate concurrence: \"I have come to agree with\nJustice Souter’s reasoning: Individuals without\nrecourse to the habeas statute because they are\nnot ’in custody’ (people merely fined or whose\nsentences have been fully served, for example)\nfit within sec. 1983’s ’broad reach.’\" Id.\n(Ginsburg, J., concurring). Justice Stevens also\naccepted Justice Souter’s position: \"Given the\nCourt’s holding that petitioner does not have a\nremedy under the habeas statute, it is perfectly\nclear, as Justice Souter explains, that he may\nbring an action under sec. 1983.\" Id. at 992 n.8\n(Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\nc.   Court of Appeals case law\n\n  In Jenkins v. Haubert, 179 F.3d. 19 (2d Cir.\n1999), the Second Circuit faced the task of\napplying Preiser and its progeny to a prisoner’s\nchallenge to conditions of his confinement, but\nnot its fact or duration. The prisoner in Jenkins\nclaimed violations of his constitutional rights\nwith respect to prison disciplinary hearings. As\na result of the hearings, Jenkins was sentenced\nto thirty days \"keeplock,\" a type of\nadministrative detention in which the prisoner is\nconfined to his cell. Jenkins then filed a sec.\n1983 action challenging his hearings. The\ndistrict court held that Jenkins’ sec. 1983\naction was not cognizable under the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Edwards because the\ndisciplinary penalty had not been overturned. The\nSecond Circuit reversed. After carefully\nreviewing both the statutes and the Supreme Court\ncase law, the Second Circuit concluded that\n\"nothing in Supreme Court precedent requires that\nthe Heck rule be applied to a challenge by a\nprisoner to a term of disciplinary segregation.\n\fMoreover, we find that to apply the Heck rule in\nsuch circumstances would contravene the\npronouncement of five Justices that some federal\nremedy--either habeas corpus or sec. 1983-- must\nbe available.\" Id. at 27.\n\nd.   Application\n\n  We believe the Second Circuit appropriately\nreconciled the statutory schemes and therefore\nadopt the reasoning of the Second Circuit as it\napplies to Mr. DeWalt’s claims regarding his\nconditions of confinement. First, we agree that\nthe Supreme Court never has addressed whether\nHeck’s favorable-termination requirement bars a\nprisoner’s challenge under sec. 1983 to an\nadministrative sanction that does not affect the\nlength of confinement. In Preiser, the Court\nclearly limited its holding to actions involving\nthe \"heart\" of habeas--the fact or duration of\nimprisonment. The Court in Heck characterized the\ncase as lying at \"the intersection\" of sec. 2254\nand sec. 1983, and held that \"[e]ven a prisoner\nwho has fully exhausted available state remedies\"\ncould not bring a cause of action under sec. 1983\n\"unless . . . the conviction or sentence is . . .\ninvalidated . . . by the grant of a writ of\nhabeas corpus.\" Id. at 489. The court in Edwards\nsimply extended Heck to administrative\nproceedings that affect the length of confinement\nand, therefore, for which habeas is available.\nFinally, Spencer speaks only to the effect of\nsubsequent release on a habeas petition; the\ndiscussion of sec. 1983 is limited to dictum and\nthe concurring opinions. The Court simply never\nhas \"announced that the Heck rule bars a\nprisoner’s challenge under sec. 1983 to an\nadministrative or disciplinary sanction that does\nnot affect the overall length of confinement.\"\nJenkins, 179 F.3d at 27.\n\n  Furthermore, we, like the Second Circuit in\nJenkins, are hesitant to apply the Heck rule in\nsuch a way as would contravene the pronouncement\nof five sitting Justices. See id. The concurring\nand dissenting opinions in Spencer reveal that\nfive justices now hold the view that a sec. 1983\naction must be available to challenge\nconstitutional wrongs where federal habeas is not\navailable. Although this perspective originally\nhad been a minority view, it is not after\nSpencer. Justice Ginsburg has \"come to agree with\nJustice Souter’s reasoning: Individuals without\nrecourse to the habeas statute because they are\nnot ’in custody’ (people merely fined or whose\nsentences have been fully served, for example)\nfit within sec. 1983’s ’broad reach.’\" Spencer,\n523 U.S. at 21 (Ginsburg, J., concurring)./5\n\n  In the absence of binding Supreme Court\n\fprecedent, and in light of the guidance offered\nby the concurrences in Heck and Spencer, we turn\nto Mr. DeWalt’s claims. Unlike the plaintiffs in\nPreiser, Heck, and Edwards, Mr. DeWalt’s case\ndoes not \"lie at the intersection\" of sections\n2254 and 1983. Mr. DeWalt does not challenge the\nfact or duration of his confinement, but only a\ncondition of his confinement--the loss of his\nprison job. Consequently, under our precedent,\nMr. DeWalt may not pursue a habeas action. See\nPischke v. Litsher, 178 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir.)\n(holding that habeas is the proper vehicle for\npresenting a claim \"if but only if the prisoner\nis seeking to ’get out’ of custody in some\nmeaningful sense\"), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 380\n(1999); Graham v. Broglin, 922 F.2d 379, 381 (7th\nCir. 1991) (stating that if a prisoner is\nchallenging \"merely the conditions of his\nconfinement his proper remedy is under the civil\nrights law\"). Because federal habeas relief is\nnot available to Mr. DeWalt, the language of sec.\n1983 and the Court’s decision in Preiser dictate\nthat he be able to proceed on his sec. 1983\naction. In Preiser, the Court held that the more\nspecific federal habeas statute must necessarily\nsupersede the more general sec. 1983 statute to\neffectuate \"explicit congressional intent.\" 411\nU.S. at 489; see also Heck, 512 U.S. at 497-98\n(Souter, J., concurring). In this case, where\nhabeas is not applicable, the requirements of the\nhabeas statute do not supersede the explicit\nright to proceed under sec. 1983. Consequently,\nMr. DeWalt may proceed with his sec. 1983 action\nwithout first seeking to invalidate the state\ncourt action through habeas.\n\n  We are aware that our decisions in Anderson v.\nCounty of Montgomery, 111 F.3d 494 (7th Cir.\n1997), and Stone-Bey v. Barnes, 120 F.3d 718 (7th\nCir. 1997), precluded plaintiffs from pursuing\nsec. 1983 actions when federal habeas was not\navailable or when the prisoner had not first\navailed himself of that option. However, we note\nthat both of these cases preceded Spencer.\nIndeed, our more recent cases have questioned the\nviability of Anderson and Stone-Bey in light of\nthe Justices’ reluctance to apply the Heck rule\nto situations in which habeas relief is not\navailable. See Hoard v. Reddy, 175 F.3d 531, 533\n(7th Cir.) (\"[T]here is probably an exception to\nthe rule of Heck for cases in which no route\nother than a damages action under section 1983 is\nopen to the person to challenge his\nconviction.\"), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 411\n(1999); Carr v. O’Leary, 167 F.3d 1124, 1127 (7th\nCir. 1999) (\"With Carr unable to get the\ndisciplinary sanction reversed, five Justices\nwould not consider the sanction a bar to a\nsection 1983 suit even though that suit calls\ninto question the validity of the sanction.\");\n\fSylvester v. Hanks, 140 F.3d 713, 714 (7th Cir.\n1998) (questioning whether Heck would preclude a\nsec. 1983 action to review placement in\nsegregation given that \"few states afford\ncollateral review of prison disciplinary\nhearings\"). Our decision today necessitates that\nwe overrule Anderson and Stone-Bey to the extent\nthey take the contrary position./6\n\n  To summarize, we hold today that the\nunavailability of federal habeas relief does not\npreclude a prisoner from bringing a sec. 1983\naction to challenge a condition of his\nconfinement that results from a prison\ndisciplinary action.\n\n3.\n\n  Having determined that a dismissal is not\njustified on either of the grounds the district\ncourt gave for dismissing Mr. DeWalt’s claims\nregarding the loss of his prison job, we turn to\nwhether Mr. DeWalt’s allegations state a claim on\nwhich relief can be granted. As noted above, Mr.\nDeWalt alleges that Officer Young, with help from\nMs. Biester, worked to remove him from his prison\njob because of his race and because he filed a\ngrievance against Officer Young.\n\n  We consider Mr. DeWalt’s allegations of racial\ndiscrimination first. Unless it is narrowly\ntailored to serve a compelling state interest,\nracial discrimination by state actors violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson\nCo., 488 U.S. 469, 493-94 (1989). A plaintiff\nasserting an equal protection violation must\nestablish that a state actor has treated him\ndifferently than persons of a different race and\nthat the state actor did so purposefully. See\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-42 (1976);\nIndianapolis Minority Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v.\nWiley, 187 F.3d 743, 752 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n  Although his complaint is less than pellucid,\nMr. DeWalt certainly alleges that he was\ndiscriminated against because of his race, and\nnothing in his complaint negates the possibility\nthat he could establish an equal protection\nviolation. We conclude that Mr. DeWalt’s\nallegation that he was removed from his job\nbecause of his race states a claim on which\nrelief can be granted.\n\n  We come to the same conclusion with regard to\nMr. DeWalt’s allegations of retaliation. An act\ntaken in retaliation for the exercise of a\nconstitutionally protected right violates the\nConstitution. See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd.\nof Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 283-84 (1977);\n\fMatzker v. Herr, 748 F.2d 1142, 1150 (7th Cir.\n1984), limited on other grounds, Salazar v. City\nof Chicago, 940 F.2d 233, 240-41 (7th Cir. 1991).\nPrisoners have a constitutional right of access\nto the courts that, by necessity, includes the\nright to pursue the administrative remedies that\nmust be exhausted before a prisoner can seek\nrelief in court. See Preiser, 411 U.S. at 493.\nThus, a prison official may not retaliate against\na prisoner because that prisoner filed a\ngrievance. See Babcock, 102 F.3d at 274-75;\nBlack, 22 F.3d at 1402-03; see also Higgason, 83\nF.3d at 810 (retaliation for filing lawsuit);\nMurphy v. Lane, 833 F.2d 106, 108-09 (7th Cir.\n1987) (per curiam) (same). This is so even if the\nadverse action does not independently violate the\nConstitution. See Babcock, 102 F.3d at 275. \"To\nstate a cause of action for retaliatory\ntreatment, a complaint need only allege a\nchronology of events from which retaliation may\nbe inferred.\" Black, 22 F.3d at 1399 (citations\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n  The allegations made in Mr. DeWalt’s complaint\ncertainly present a chronology from which\nretaliation can be inferred. According to Mr.\nDeWalt, it was only shortly after he filed a\ngrievance against Officer Young that Officer\nYoung and Ms. Biester acted to have him removed\nfrom his prison job. Moreover, Mr. DeWalt can\npoint to statements by two other prison staff\nmembers admitting that there was a concerted\neffort by certain prison staff, including Officer\nYoung and Ms. Biester, to retaliate against Mr.\nDeWalt. Thus, we conclude that Mr. DeWalt’s\nallegation that he was removed from his job in\nretaliation for filing a grievance states a claim\non which relief can be granted.\n\nD. Retaliation Against Mr. DeWalt for\nReporting Misconduct\n\n  Mr. DeWalt also alleges that Officer Young, Ms.\nBiester, and Officer Smith took various other\nactions (filing false disciplinary reports,\nencouraging others to do the same, attempting to\nhave Mr. DeWalt transferred to another prison) in\nretaliation for his filing of a grievance against\nOfficer Young. The district court, however, did\nnot specifically consider these allegations. Our\nreview of the allegations persuades us that Mr.\nDeWalt has stated sufficiently a claim for\nretaliation.\n\n  Again, Mr. DeWalt’s allegations adequately set\nforth a chronology of events from which\nretaliation may be inferred. See Black, 22 F.3d\nat 1399. To begin with, the alleged retaliatory\nactions began almost immediately after Mr. DeWalt\nfiled the grievance against Officer Young,\n\fsuggesting a causal relationship. Likewise, Mr.\nDeWalt’s claim that a prison guard informed him\nthat several staff members, including Officer\nYoung and Ms. Biester, were plotting to report\nhim for disciplinary violations whenever possible\nalso supports his claim. The same is true of Mr.\nDeWalt’s allegation that, on several occasions in\nthe weeks and months after he filed the grievance\nagainst Officer Young, he received unjustified\ndisciplinary reports from other staff members,\nculminating in the incident involving Officer\nSmith in November. That incident, too, suggests\nMr. DeWalt was the subject of retaliation in that\nOfficer Smith allegedly told Mr. DeWalt that he\nwas giving him a disciplinary report precisely\nbecause Mr. DeWalt had filed a grievance against\nOfficer Young. Accordingly, we conclude that it\nwould be improper to dismiss Mr. DeWalt’s\nretaliation claims for failure to state a claim.\n\nE.   Officer Smith’s Use of Force\n\n  The district court dismissed Mr. DeWalt’s\nexcessive force claim because Mr. DeWalt’s\ncomplaint did not establish that Officer Smith’s\nuse of force (shoving Mr. DeWalt into a door\nframe) was motivated by something other than a\ngood faith effort to maintain or restore\ndiscipline. Accordingly, the court reasoned, Mr.\nDeWalt had failed to show that the force Officer\nSmith employed was excessive. We agree that Mr.\nDeWalt’s excessive force claim must be dismissed,\nthough for slightly different reasons than those\narticulated by the district court.\n\n  The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the\nEighth Amendment prohibits the \"unnecessary and\nwanton infliction of pain\" on prisoners. See\nHudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 5 (1992);\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102-03 (1976).\nWhat constitutes an \"unnecessary and wanton\ninfliction of pain,\" however, \"varies according\nto the nature of the alleged constitutional\nviolation.\" Hudson, 503 U.S. at 5. In excessive\nforce cases, \"the core judicial inquiry\" is\n\"whether force was applied in a good-faith effort\nto maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously\nand sadistically to cause harm.\" Id. at 6-7. A\ncourt should examine a variety of factors in\nconducting this inquiry, including the need for\nan application of force, the relationship between\nthat need and the force applied, the threat\nreasonably perceived by the responsible officers,\nthe efforts made to temper the severity of the\nforce employed, and the extent of the injury\nsuffered by the prisoner. See id. at 7. With\nregard to the last of these factors, while\nsignificant injury is not required, a claim\nordinarily cannot be predicated upon a de minimis\nuse of physical force. See id. at 9-10. Thus, not\n\fevery push or shove by a prison guard violates a\nprisoner’s constitutional rights. See id. at 9\n(citing Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d\nCir. 1973)).\n\n  Officer Smith’s simple act of shoving Mr. DeWalt\nqualifies as the kind of de minimis use of force\nthat does not constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment. Compare Lunsford v. Bennett, 17 F.3d\n1574, 1582 (7th Cir. 1994) (pouring a bucket of\nwater on prisoner and causing the bucket to hit\nhim in the head characterized as de minimis),\nwith Thomas v. Stalter, 20 F.3d 298, 301-02 (7th\nCir. 1994) (punching a prisoner with a closed\nfist, while held down by other officers,\nqualified as more than de minimis). The shove was\na single and isolated act, unaccompanied by\nfurther uses of force. Moreover, the bruising Mr.\nDeWalt allegedly suffered does not appear to have\nbeen particularly serious. Although we certainly\ndo not condone the unjustified use of force by\nprison guards, Mr. DeWalt’s allegations regarding\nOfficer Smith’s use of force against him fall\nshort of what is required to state a claim for\nexcessive force under the Eighth Amendment.\nAccordingly, the district court did not err in\ndismissing Mr. DeWalt’s excessive force claim.\n\nF.   Warden Lamark Carter\n\n  The district court did not specifically address\nMr. DeWalt’s claim against Mr. Carter, but it is\nclear that his claim against Mr. Carter was\nproperly dismissed. Mr. DeWalt’s claim, that Mr.\nCarter failed to remedy or prevent the illegal\nactions taken by Officer Young, Ms. Biester, and\nMr. Murray, is, at bottom, a claim that Mr.\nCarter failed to protect Mr. DeWalt from, and\ntherefore condoned, the discrimination and\nretaliation he allegedly experienced. See Gentry\nv. Duckworth, 65 F.3d 555, 561 (7th Cir. 1995);\nsee also Bohen v. City of East Chicago, Ind., 799\nF.2d 1180, 1189-92 (7th Cir. 1986) (Posner, J.,\nconcurring)./7\n\n  To succeed on his claims, Mr. DeWalt must prove\nthat Mr. Carter acted intentionally, or at least\nwith deliberate indifference. See Babcock, 102\nF.3d at 275; Nabozny, 92 F.3d at 453-54. In his\ncomplaint, however, Mr. DeWalt specifically\nalleges that Mr. Carter acted negligently.\nNegligence, even gross negligence, does not rise\nto the level of deliberate indifference, see\nNabozny, 92 F.3d at 454, and therefore does not\nsatisfy the state of mind requirement for either\nof the constitutional violations Mr. DeWalt\nalleges. Cf. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n833-38 (1994) (discussing deliberate indifference\nin the Eighth Amendment context). In fact, an\nallegation of negligence is inconsistent with the\n\fclaims Mr. DeWalt pursues and will support a\ndismissal for failure to state a claim. Cf.\nAntonelli v. Sheahan, 81 F.3d 1422, 1429 (7th\nCir. 1996). Accordingly, because Mr. DeWalt\nalleges Mr. Carter acted negligently, Mr.\nDeWalt’s claim against Mr. Carter was properly\ndismissed./8\nConclusion\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and\nreverse and remand in part the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED and REMANDED in part\n\n\n\n/* After an examination of the briefs and the\nrecord, we have concluded that oral argument is\nunnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the\nbriefs and the record. See Fed. R. App. P.\n34(a)(2). Only the appellant has filed a brief\nbecause this court previously had granted a\nmotion for an order of non-involvement based upon\nlack of service in the trial court. The\ndefendants-appellees further declined our\ninvitation to submit a brief.\n\n/1 The facts here and throughout the opinion are\ntaken from Mr. DeWalt’s complaint and materials\nattached to it. We accept them as true and\nconstrue them in the light most favorable to Mr.\nDeWalt. See Hentosh v. Herman M. Finch Univ. of\nHealth Sciences/ The Chicago Med. Sch., 167 F.3d\n1170, 1173 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n/2 Mr. DeWalt has abandoned his claim that Officer\nSmith fabricated a disciplinary report because he\nfailed to address it in his appellate brief. See\nDuncan v. State of Wisconsin Dep’t of Health &\nFamily Servs., 166 F.3d 930, 934 (7th Cir. 1999).\nWe also decline to review an Eighth Amendment\nclaim Mr. DeWalt raises for the first time on\nappeal regarding the alleged failure of Officer\nSmith and another officer to provide him with\nmedical care after Officer Smith shoved him. See\nWeigel v. Target Stores, 122 F.3d 461, 464 (7th\nCir. 1997).\n\n/3 This does not mean, however, that the use of\nracially derogatory language is without legal\nsignificance. Such language is strong evidence of\nracial animus, an essential element of any equal\nprotection claim. See Williams, 180 F.3d at 706;\nBell v. City of Milwaukee, 746 F.2d 1205, 1259\n(7th Cir. 1984). Thus, although the use of\nracially derogatory language, by itself, does not\nviolate the Constitution, it can be quite\nimportant evidence of a constitutional violation.\n\f/4 Justice Scalia responded to Justice Souter by\nstating that \"the principle barring collateral\nattacks--a longstanding and deeply rooted feature\nof both the common law and our own jurisprudence-\n-is not rendered inapplicable by the fortuity\nthat a convicted criminal is no longer\nincarcerated.\" Id. at 490 n.10. However, \"the\nfortuity\" of release was not at issue in Heck.\n\n/5 We note that the Supreme Court has expressly\ndisapproved of the practice of relying on\nstatements in separate opinions to determine\nwhether a case has been overruled. See Agostini\nv. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 217 (1997); cf. State\nOil v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20 (approving this\ncourt’s decision not to treat a case as overruled\ndespite the weakening of its foundation). Here,\nhowever, we rely on separate opinions not to\noverrule precedent, but to help guide us in\ndeciding an open question.\n\n/6 This opinion has been circulated to all judges in\nactive service under the provisions of Circuit\nRule 40(e). No judge in active service favored a\nrehearing en banc.\n\n/7 Mr. DeWalt’s claim encompasses two distinct\nconstitutional violations. On the one hand, to\nthe extent Mr. Carter failed to protect Mr.\nDeWalt from discrimination, Mr. DeWalt’s claim is\nan equal protection claim requiring him to show\nthat Mr. Carter purposefully discriminated\nagainst him based on his membership in a\ndefinable class, namely, based on his race. See\nIndianapolis Minority Contractors, 187 F.3d at\n752; Nabozny v. Podlesny, 92 F.3d 446, 453-54\n(7th Cir. 1996). On the other hand, to the extent\nMr. Carter failed to protect Mr. DeWalt from\nretaliation, Mr. DeWalt’s claim is a retaliation\nclaim requiring him to prove that Mr. Carter\npurposefully retaliated against him because he\nexercised a constitutionally protected right,\nnamely, because he filed grievances complaining\nof his mistreatment. See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at\n287; Babcock, 102 F.3d at 275.\n\n/8 Mr. DeWalt also suggests that Mr. Carter failed\nto remedy or protect him from certain Eighth\nAmendment violations by Officer Young, Ms.\nBiester, and Mr. Murray. Because Mr. DeWalt\ncannot state an Eighth Amendment claim against\nany of these defendants, however, we will not\naddress this possible claim. In any event, such a\nclaim would fail for the same reason his other\nclaims against Mr. Carter fail. See Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 833-38 (negligence insufficient to state\nEighth Amendment claim).\n\f",

Reinhard, Judge.\n\n\nSubmitted July 14, 1999/*--Decided August 11, 2000\n\n\n\n  Before HARLINGTON WOOD, JR., COFFEY and RIPPLE, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n  RIPPLE, Circuit Judge. Anthony DeWalt, an\nIllinois prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks\ncompensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 1983 against five individuals employed at\nthe Dixon Correctional Center (\"Dixon\") for\nalleged violations of his First, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendment rights. Mr. DeWalt claims\nthat various defendants used racially insulting\nand sexually explicit language when speaking to\nhim, engaged in a racially motivated and\nretaliatory conspiracy to get him fired from his\nprison job, retaliated against him in a variety\nof other ways for filing a grievance against a\nprison guard, used excessive force in illegally\npunishing him, and ignored his complaints of\ndiscrimination and retaliation. The district\ncourt dismissed Mr. DeWalt’s complaint for\nfailure to state a claim. We affirm in part and\nreverse in part.\n\nI\nBACKGROUND\n  Anthony DeWalt’s problems at Dixon began on\nAugust 8, 1997, when Correctional Officer Young,\na prison guard, approached him while he was\nworking at his job cleaning the building that\nhouses the prison school./1 Officer Young made a\nseries of sexually suggestive and racially\n\fderogatory comments to him regarding certain\nfemale teachers at the prison school. Mr. DeWalt\nfiled a grievance against Officer Young based on\nthe incident. Mr. DeWalt’s decision to file the\ngrievance set off a wave of retaliation by the\ndefendants and other prison employees.\n\n  During the following week, Officer Young went to\nCarol Biester, an administrator at the prison\nschool, and suggested to her that Mr. DeWalt was\ntrying to initiate an intimate relationship with\na teacher at the prison school. Ms. Biester, in\nresponse, instructed Mr. DeWalt in an abrasive\nand insulting manner not to enter the teacher’s\nclassroom.\n\n  Shortly thereafter, on August 14, Officer Young\nordered Mr. DeWalt to clean the teacher’s\nclassroom, and Mr. DeWalt did so. Officer Young,\nhowever, submitted a disciplinary report charging\nMr. DeWalt with entering the classroom in\ncontravention of Ms. Biester’s orders. Based on\nOfficer Young’s disciplinary report, Ms. Biester\nremoved Mr. DeWalt from his job. Mr. DeWalt\nchallenged Officer Young’s disciplinary report\ninternally, but the prison’s Adjustment Committee\nfound Mr. DeWalt guilty of the disciplinary\nviolation on August 26, 1997. As a result, Mr.\nDeWalt was permanently reassigned from his job at\nthe prison school.\n\n  At about the same time Mr. DeWalt lost his\nprison job, Dan Murray, a prison administrator,\ntook him aside, informed him that he had heard\nOfficer Young’s allegations about Mr. DeWalt’s\ninterest in the teacher, and proceeded to berate\nMr. DeWalt in racially derogatory terms for\ngetting into trouble and for pursuing prison\nteachers. Several weeks later, Mr. Murray refused\nto reassign Mr. DeWalt to a new prison job,\ndespite the warden’s instructions to do so.\n\n  Over the next few weeks, Mr. DeWalt received two\nmore groundless disciplinary reports from other\nprison staff members who are not defendants in\nthe present case. The prison guard who gave Mr.\nDeWalt the second of these reports informed Mr.\nDeWalt that Ms. Biester and Officer Young had\nenlisted a number of prison staff members to give\nMr. DeWalt disciplinary reports whenever possible\nbecause Mr. DeWalt had filed a grievance against\nOfficer Young.\n\n  Finally, in early November 1997, Correctional\nOfficer Smith, another prison guard, issued Mr.\nDeWalt a disciplinary report. He informed Mr.\nDeWalt that he was receiving the disciplinary\nreport because he had filed a grievance against\nOfficer Young and because correctional officers\n\"stick together.\" R.11. As Mr. DeWalt walked\n\faway, he told Officer Smith that his actions were\nunprofessional, whereupon Officer Smith jumped up\nand shoved Mr. DeWalt toward the doorway and into\nthe door frame. Mr. DeWalt suffered bruising on\nhis back where he hit the door frame; the prison\nmedical staff, however, did not note any visible\ninjury and did not order X-rays.\n\n  Throughout this time period, Mr. DeWalt wrote\nseveral letters to Dixon’s warden, Lamark Carter,\ncomplaining about several of the incidents\ndescribed above. Mr. Carter offered Mr. DeWalt a\njob in another part of the prison; however, it\nappears that Mr. Carter took no other actions.\n\n  Liberally construed, see Hudson v.

Accordingly, Mr.\nDeWalt’s claims that Officer Young and Mr. Murray\nviolated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment\nrights by directing racially derogatory and\nsexually explicit language at him were properly\ndismissed.\n\nC.  Removal of Mr. DeWalt from his Job\n  The district court rejected Mr. DeWalt’s claim\nconcerning the loss of his job at the prison\nschool on two grounds. First, the court noted\nthat Illinois prisoners have no right to hold a\nparticular prison job, or any job at all for that\nmatter. It concluded, therefore, that Mr. DeWalt\ncould not base a sec. 1983 claim on the loss of\nhis prison job. Alternatively, the district court\nheld that Mr. DeWalt could not pursue a sec. 1983\ndamages claim based on the loss of his prison job\nbecause Edwards v.

To establish a procedural due process\nviolation, a prisoner must demonstrate that the\nstate deprived him of a liberty or property\ninterest created either by state law or the Due\nProcess Clause itself.

Today, we\njoin the Second Circuit and hold that a prisoner\nmay bring a sec. 1983 claim \"challenging the\nconditions of [his] confinement where [he] is\nunable to challenge the conditions through a\npetition for federal habeas corpus.\" Jenkins v.\nHaubert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764670\"><a href=\"/opinion/764670/eric-jenkins-v-lt-haubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\na.   Statutory framework\n\f  Because Mr. DeWalt’s claim involves both sec.\n1983 and the federal habeas statute, we begin our\nanalysis by looking at both statutes. Section\n1983 provides:\n\nEvery person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any\nState or Territory or the District of Columbia,\nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen\nof the United States or other person within the\njurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any\nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to the\nparty injured in any action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress .\n. . .\n\n42 U.S.C. sec. 1983. By its terms, sec. 1983 does\nnot require a plaintiff to exhaust state remedies\nbefore bringing a cause of action. This\nrequirement, however, was imposed statutorily for\nprisoners in 1996, when Congress enacted the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"). That Act\nprohibits a prisoner from bringing a sec. 1983\naction \"until such administrative remedies as are\navailable are exhausted.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n1997e(a).\n\n  The federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. sec. 2254,\nprovides an avenue to challenge unconstitutional\nconfinement by state authorities. It states in\nrelevant part:\n\n  (a) The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a\ncircuit judge, or a district court shall\nentertain an application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant\nto the judgment of a State court only on the\nground that he is in custody in violation of the\nConstitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates.\n\n  (b)(1) An application for a writ of habeas\ncorpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant\nto the judgment of a State court shall not be\ngranted unless it appears that--\n\n  (A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies\navailable in the courts of the State; or\n\n  (B)(i) there is an absence of available State\ncorrective process; or\n\n  (ii) circumstances exist that render such\nprocess ineffective to protect the rights of the\napplicant.\n\n28 U.S.C. sec. 2254.\n\n  A tension between these two statutes arises when\n\fa prisoner, one \"in custody,\" challenges an\naspect of his confinement not through the tool of\nhabeas corpus, but through a sec. 1983 action,\neither for injunctive relief or damages. Because\nthe statutes do not address their overlap and\nresulting conflict, the task of discerning\ncongressional intent has fallen on the courts. We\nturn now to that case law.\n\nb.   Supreme Court case law\n\n  The Supreme Court first considered whether sec.\n1983 could be used to bring actions relating to a\nplaintiff’s conviction or sentence in Preiser v.\nRodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108772\"><a href=\"/opinion/108772/preiser-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). In Preiser,\nseveral prisoners sought injunctive relief under\nsec. 1983 to have restored good time credits that\nthey had lost as a result of a prison\ndisciplinary action. The Court concluded that\nsec. 1983 could not be used to pursue such relief\nbecause Congress had designated the federal\nhabeas statute as the exclusive federal remedy\nfor state prisoners who challenge the fact or\nduration of their confinement and seek immediate\nor speedier release. See id. at 489-90.\n\"Congress,\" it stated, \"has determined that\nhabeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state\nprisoners attacking the validity of the fact or\nlength of their confinement, and that specific\ndetermination must override the general terms of\nsec. 1983.\" Id. at 490. The Court also clarified\nwhen sec. 1983 relief would be available to\nprisoners: \"[A] sec. 1983 action is a proper\nremedy for a state prisoner who is making a\nconstitutional challenge to the conditions of his\nprison life, but not to the fact or length of his\ncustody.\" Id. at 499.\n\n  Just over twenty years later, in Heck v.\nHumphrey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994), the Supreme Court\ntook up a question left unanswered by Preiser:\nwhether a plaintiff may bring a sec. 1983 claim\nfor damages that challenges the underlying\nconviction or sentence. The Court analogized such\nclaims to malicious prosecution actions and\nopined that a sec. 1983 action should not be\navailable to challenge a conviction or sentence\nunless the conviction or sentence already has\nbeen invalidated. See id. at 484-87. Accordingly,\nthe Court held:\n\n[I]n order to recover damages for allegedly\nunconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or\nfor other harm caused by actions whose\nunlawfulness would render a conviction or\nsentence invalid, a sec. 1983 plaintiff must\nprove that the conviction or sentence has been\nreversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive\norder, declared invalid by a state tribunal\nauthorized to make such determination, or called\n\finto question by a federal court’s issuance of a\nwrit of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. sec. 2254. A\nclaim for damages bearing that relationship to a\nconviction or sentence that has not been so\ninvalidated is not cognizable under sec. 1983.\n\nId. at 486-87 (footnote omitted).\n\n  In his concurring opinion, Justice Souter noted\nthe difficulty presented by such a broad reading\nof Heck. However, he concluded that the Court’s\nopinion could be read \"as saying nothing more\nthan that now, after enactment of the habeas\nstatute and because of it, prison inmates seeking\nsec. 1983 damages in federal court for\nunconstitutional conviction or confinement must\nsatisfy a requirement analogous to the malicious-\nprosecution tort’s favorable-termination\nrequirement.\" 512 U.S. at 500. \"That,\" continued\nJustice Souter,\n\nwould be a sensible way to read the opinion, in\npart because the alternative would needlessly\nplace at risk the rights of those outside the\nintersection of sec. 1983 and the habeas statute,\nindividuals not \"in custody\" for habeas purposes.\nIf these individuals . . . were required to show\nthe prior invalidation of their convictions or\nsentences in order to obtain sec. 1983 damages\nfor unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,\nthe result would be to deny any federal forum for\nclaiming a deprivation of federal rights to those\nwho cannot first obtain a favorable state ruling.\nThe reason, of course, is that individuals not\n\"in custody\" cannot invoke federal habeas\njurisdiction, the only statutory mechanism\nbesides sec. 1983 by which individuals may sue\nstate officials in federal court for violating\nfederal rights. That would be an untoward result.\n\nId./4\n\n  Edwards v.

Concerned\nwith the fact that, as a consequence of the\nCourt’s ruling, the petitioner may have lacked a\nremedy for any unconstitutional actions taken in\nrevoking his parole, the concurring and\ndissenting Justices in Spencer took the\nopportunity to clarify their positions regarding\nthe scope of the Heck rule. Justice Souter,\njoined by Justices O’Connor, Ginsburg, and\nBreyer, wrote: \"The better view, then, is that a\nformer prisoner, no longer ’in custody,’ may\nbring a sec. 1983 action establishing the\nunconstitutionality of a conviction or\nconfinement without being bound to satisfy a\nfavorable-termination requirement that it would\nbe impossible as a matter of law for him to\nsatisfy.\" Id. at 990 (Souter, J., concurring).\nJustice Ginsburg reiterated her agreement in her\nseparate concurrence: \"I have come to agree with\nJustice Souter’s reasoning: Individuals without\nrecourse to the habeas statute because they are\nnot ’in custody’ (people merely fined or whose\nsentences have been fully served, for example)\nfit within sec. 1983’s ’broad reach.’\" Id.\n(Ginsburg, J., concurring). Justice Stevens also\naccepted Justice Souter’s position: \"Given the\nCourt’s holding that petitioner does not have a\nremedy under the habeas statute, it is perfectly\nclear, as Justice Souter explains, that he may\nbring an action under sec. 1983.\" Id. at 992 n.8\n(Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\nc.   Court of Appeals case law\n\n  In Jenkins v. Haubert, 179 F.3d. 19 (2d Cir.\n1999), the Second Circuit faced the task of\napplying Preiser and its progeny to a prisoner’s\nchallenge to conditions of his confinement, but\nnot its fact or duration. The prisoner in Jenkins\nclaimed violations of his constitutional rights\nwith respect to prison disciplinary hearings. As\na result of the hearings, Jenkins was sentenced\nto thirty days \"keeplock,\" a type of\nadministrative detention in which the prisoner is\nconfined to his cell. Jenkins then filed a sec.\n1983 action challenging his hearings. The\ndistrict court held that Jenkins’ sec. 1983\naction was not cognizable under the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Edwards because the\ndisciplinary penalty had not been overturned. The\nSecond Circuit reversed. After carefully\nreviewing both the statutes and the Supreme Court\ncase law, the Second Circuit concluded that\n\"nothing in Supreme Court precedent requires that\nthe Heck rule be applied to a challenge by a\nprisoner to a term of disciplinary segregation.\n\fMoreover, we find that to apply the Heck rule in\nsuch circumstances would contravene the\npronouncement of five Justices that some federal\nremedy--either habeas corpus or sec. 1983-- must\nbe available.\" Id. at 27.\n\nd.   Application\n\n  We believe the Second Circuit appropriately\nreconciled the statutory schemes and therefore\nadopt the reasoning of the Second Circuit as it\napplies to Mr. DeWalt’s claims regarding his\nconditions of confinement. First, we agree that\nthe Supreme Court never has addressed whether\nHeck’s favorable-termination requirement bars a\nprisoner’s challenge under sec. 1983 to an\nadministrative sanction that does not affect the\nlength of confinement. In Preiser, the Court\nclearly limited its holding to actions involving\nthe \"heart\" of habeas--the fact or duration of\nimprisonment. The Court in Heck characterized the\ncase as lying at \"the intersection\" of sec. 2254\nand sec. 1983, and held that \"[e]ven a prisoner\nwho has fully exhausted available state remedies\"\ncould not bring a cause of action under sec. 1983\n\"unless . . . the conviction or sentence is . . .\ninvalidated . . . by the grant of a writ of\nhabeas corpus.\" Id. at 489. The court in Edwards\nsimply extended Heck to administrative\nproceedings that affect the length of confinement\nand, therefore, for which habeas is available.\nFinally, Spencer speaks only to the effect of\nsubsequent release on a habeas petition; the\ndiscussion of sec. 1983 is limited to dictum and\nthe concurring opinions. The Court simply never\nhas \"announced that the Heck rule bars a\nprisoner’s challenge under sec. 1983 to an\nadministrative or disciplinary sanction that does\nnot affect the overall length of confinement.\"\nJenkins, 179 F.3d at 27.\n\n  Furthermore, we, like the Second Circuit in\nJenkins, are hesitant to apply the Heck rule in\nsuch a way as would contravene the pronouncement\nof five sitting Justices. See id. The concurring\nand dissenting opinions in Spencer reveal that\nfive justices now hold the view that a sec. 1983\naction must be available to challenge\nconstitutional wrongs where federal habeas is not\navailable. Although this perspective originally\nhad been a minority view, it is not after\nSpencer. Justice Ginsburg has \"come to agree with\nJustice Souter’s reasoning: Individuals without\nrecourse to the habeas statute because they are\nnot ’in custody’ (people merely fined or whose\nsentences have been fully served, for example)\nfit within sec. 1983’s ’broad reach.’\" Spencer,\n523 U.S. at 21 (Ginsburg, J., concurring)./5\n\n  In the absence of binding Supreme Court\n\fprecedent, and in light of the guidance offered\nby the concurrences in Heck and Spencer, we turn\nto Mr. DeWalt’s claims. Unlike the plaintiffs in\nPreiser, Heck, and Edwards, Mr. DeWalt’s case\ndoes not \"lie at the intersection\" of sections\n2254 and 1983. Mr. DeWalt does not challenge the\nfact or duration of his confinement, but only a\ncondition of his confinement--the loss of his\nprison job. Consequently, under our precedent,\nMr. DeWalt may not pursue a habeas action. See\nPischke v.

Because federal habeas relief is\nnot available to Mr. DeWalt, the language of sec.\n1983 and the Court’s decision in Preiser dictate\nthat he be able to proceed on his sec. 1983\naction. In Preiser, the Court held that the more\nspecific federal habeas statute must necessarily\nsupersede the more general sec. 1983 statute to\neffectuate \"explicit congressional intent.\" 411\nU.S. at 489; see also Heck, 512 U.S. at 497-98\n(Souter, J., concurring). In this case, where\nhabeas is not applicable, the requirements of the\nhabeas statute do not supersede the explicit\nright to proceed under sec. 1983.

Our decision today necessitates that\nwe overrule Anderson and Stone-Bey to the extent\nthey take the contrary position./6\n\n  To summarize, we hold today that the\nunavailability of federal habeas relief does not\npreclude a prisoner from bringing a sec. 1983\naction to challenge a condition of his\nconfinement that results from a prison\ndisciplinary action.\n\n3.\n\n  Having determined that a dismissal is not\njustified on either of the grounds the district\ncourt gave for dismissing Mr. DeWalt’s claims\nregarding the loss of his prison job, we turn to\nwhether Mr. DeWalt’s allegations state a claim on\nwhich relief can be granted. As noted above, Mr.\nDeWalt alleges that Officer Young, with help from\nMs. Biester, worked to remove him from his prison\njob because of his race and because he filed a\ngrievance against Officer Young.\n\n  We consider Mr. DeWalt’s allegations of racial\ndiscrimination first. Unless it is narrowly\ntailored to serve a compelling state interest,\nracial discrimination by state actors violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493-94 (1989). A plaintiff\nasserting an equal protection violation must\nestablish that a state actor has treated him\ndifferently than persons of a different race and\nthat the state actor did so purposefully. See\nWashington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239-42 (1976);\nIndianapolis Minority Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v.\nWiley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765660\"><a href=\"/opinion/765660/indianapolis-minority-contractors-association-incorporated-an-indiana-not/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 752 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n  Although his complaint is less than pellucid,\nMr. DeWalt certainly alleges that he was\ndiscriminated against because of his race, and\nnothing in his complaint negates the possibility\nthat he could establish an equal protection\nviolation. We conclude that Mr. DeWalt’s\nallegation that he was removed from his job\nbecause of his race states a claim on which\nrelief can be granted.\n\n  We come to the same conclusion with regard to\nMr. DeWalt’s allegations of retaliation. An act\ntaken in retaliation for the exercise of a\nconstitutionally protected right violates the\nConstitution. See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd.\nof Educ. v.

See Preiser, 411 U.S. at 493.\nThus, a prison official may not retaliate against\na prisoner because that prisoner filed a\ngrievance. See Babcock, 102 F.3d at 274-75;\nBlack, 22 F.3d at 1402-03; see also Higgason, 83\nF.3d at 810 (retaliation for filing lawsuit);\nMurphy v.

This is so even if the\nadverse action does not independently violate the\nConstitution. See Babcock, 102 F.3d at 275. \"To\nstate a cause of action for retaliatory\ntreatment, a complaint need only allege a\nchronology of events from which retaliation may\nbe inferred.\" Black, 22 F.3d at 1399 (citations\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n  The allegations made in Mr. DeWalt’s complaint\ncertainly present a chronology from which\nretaliation can be inferred. According to Mr.\nDeWalt, it was only shortly after he filed a\ngrievance against Officer Young that Officer\nYoung and Ms. Biester acted to have him removed\nfrom his prison job. Moreover, Mr. DeWalt can\npoint to statements by two other prison staff\nmembers admitting that there was a concerted\neffort by certain prison staff, including Officer\nYoung and Ms. Biester, to retaliate against Mr.\nDeWalt. Thus, we conclude that Mr. DeWalt’s\nallegation that he was removed from his job in\nretaliation for filing a grievance states a claim\non which relief can be granted.\n\nD. Retaliation Against Mr. DeWalt for\nReporting Misconduct\n\n  Mr. DeWalt also alleges that Officer Young, Ms.\nBiester, and Officer Smith took various other\nactions (filing false disciplinary reports,\nencouraging others to do the same, attempting to\nhave Mr. DeWalt transferred to another prison) in\nretaliation for his filing of a grievance against\nOfficer Young. The district court, however, did\nnot specifically consider these allegations. Our\nreview of the allegations persuades us that Mr.\nDeWalt has stated sufficiently a claim for\nretaliation.\n\n  Again, Mr. DeWalt’s allegations adequately set\nforth a chronology of events from which\nretaliation may be inferred. See Black, 22 F.3d\nat 1399. To begin with, the alleged retaliatory\nactions began almost immediately after Mr. DeWalt\nfiled the grievance against Officer Young,\n\fsuggesting a causal relationship. Likewise, Mr.\nDeWalt’s claim that a prison guard informed him\nthat several staff members, including Officer\nYoung and Ms. Biester, were plotting to report\nhim for disciplinary violations whenever possible\nalso supports his claim. The same is true of Mr.\nDeWalt’s allegation that, on several occasions in\nthe weeks and months after he filed the grievance\nagainst Officer Young, he received unjustified\ndisciplinary reports from other staff members,\nculminating in the incident involving Officer\nSmith in November. That incident, too, suggests\nMr. DeWalt was the subject of retaliation in that\nOfficer Smith allegedly told Mr. DeWalt that he\nwas giving him a disciplinary report precisely\nbecause Mr. DeWalt had filed a grievance against\nOfficer Young. Accordingly, we conclude that it\nwould be improper to dismiss Mr. DeWalt’s\nretaliation claims for failure to state a claim.\n\nE.   Officer Smith’s Use of Force\n\n  The district court dismissed Mr. DeWalt’s\nexcessive force claim because Mr. DeWalt’s\ncomplaint did not establish that Officer Smith’s\nuse of force (shoving Mr. DeWalt into a door\nframe) was motivated by something other than a\ngood faith effort to maintain or restore\ndiscipline. Accordingly, the court reasoned, Mr.\nDeWalt had failed to show that the force Officer\nSmith employed was excessive. We agree that Mr.\nDeWalt’s excessive force claim must be dismissed,\nthough for slightly different reasons than those\narticulated by the district court.\n\n  The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the\nEighth Amendment prohibits the \"unnecessary and\nwanton infliction of pain\" on prisoners. See\nHudson v. McMillian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1992);\nEstelle v.

In excessive\nforce cases, \"the core judicial inquiry\" is\n\"whether force was applied in a good-faith effort\nto maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously\nand sadistically to cause harm.\" Id. at 6-7. A\ncourt should examine a variety of factors in\nconducting this inquiry, including the need for\nan application of force, the relationship between\nthat need and the force applied, the threat\nreasonably perceived by the responsible officers,\nthe efforts made to temper the severity of the\nforce employed, and the extent of the injury\nsuffered by the prisoner. See id. at 7. With\nregard to the last of these factors, while\nsignificant injury is not required, a claim\nordinarily cannot be predicated upon a de minimis\nuse of physical force. See id. at 9-10. Thus, not\n\fevery push or shove by a prison guard violates a\nprisoner’s constitutional rights. See id. at 9\n(citing Johnson v. Glick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312370\"><a href=\"/opinion/312370/australia-johnson-v-a-glick-warden-of-manhattan-house-of-detention-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1033 (2d\nCir. 1973)).\n\n  Officer Smith’s simple act of shoving Mr. DeWalt\nqualifies as the kind of de minimis use of force\nthat does not constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment.

State of Wisconsin Dep’t of Health &\nFamily Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761279\"><a href=\"/opinion/761279/daniel-p-duncan-v-state-of-wisconsin-department-of-health-and-family/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 934 (7th Cir. 1999).\nWe also decline to review an Eighth Amendment\nclaim Mr. DeWalt raises for the first time on\nappeal regarding the alleged failure of Officer\nSmith and another officer to provide him with\nmedical care after Officer Smith shoved him. See\nWeigel v. Target Stores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744803\"><a href=\"/opinion/744803/shirley-weigel-v-target-stores-a-division-of-dayton-hudson-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 464 (7th\nCir. 1997).\n\n/3 This does not mean, however, that the use of\nracially derogatory language is without legal\nsignificance. Such language is strong evidence of\nracial animus, an essential element of any equal\nprotection claim. See Williams, 180 F.3d at 706;\nBell v. City of Milwaukee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443256\"><a href=\"/opinion/443256/patrick-bell-sr-etc-v-city-of-milwaukee-howard-johnson-and-edwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1259\n(7th Cir. 1984). Thus, although the use of\nracially derogatory language, by itself, does not\nviolate the Constitution, it can be quite\nimportant evidence of a constitutional violation.\n\f/4 Justice Scalia responded to Justice Souter by\nstating that \"the principle barring collateral\nattacks--a longstanding and deeply rooted feature\nof both the common law and our own jurisprudence-\n-is not rendered inapplicable by the fortuity\nthat a convicted criminal is no longer\nincarcerated.\" Id. at 490 n.10. However, \"the\nfortuity\" of release was not at issue in Heck.\n\n/5 We note that the Supreme Court has expressly\ndisapproved of the practice of relying on\nstatements in separate opinions to determine\nwhether a case has been overruled. See Agostini\nv. Felton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118133\"><a href=\"/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 217 (1997); cf. State\nOil v. Khan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118149\"><a href=\"/opinion/118149/state-oil-co-v-khan/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (approving this\ncourt’s decision not to treat a case as overruled\ndespite the weakening of its foundation). Here,\nhowever, we rely on separate opinions not to\noverrule precedent, but to help guide us in\ndeciding an open question.\n\n/6 This opinion has been circulated to all judges in\nactive service under the provisions of Circuit\nRule 40(e). No judge in active service favored a\nrehearing en banc.\n\n/7 Mr. DeWalt’s claim encompasses two distinct\nconstitutional violations. On the one hand, to\nthe extent Mr. Carter failed to protect Mr.\nDeWalt from discrimination, Mr. DeWalt’s claim is\nan equal protection claim requiring him to show\nthat Mr. Carter purposefully discriminated\nagainst him based on his membership in a\ndefinable class, namely, based on his race. See\nIndianapolis Minority Contractors, 187 F.3d at\n752; Nabozny v. Podlesny, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723958\"><a href=\"/opinion/723958/jamie-s-nabozny-v-mary-podlesny-william-davis-thomas-blauert/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453-54\n(7th Cir. 1996). On the other hand, to the extent\nMr. Carter failed to protect Mr. DeWalt from\nretaliation, Mr. DeWalt’s claim is a retaliation\nclaim requiring him to prove that Mr. Carter\npurposefully retaliated against him because he\nexercised a constitutionally protected right,\nnamely, because he filed grievances complaining\nof his mistreatment. See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at\n287; Babcock, 102 F.3d at 275.\n\n/8 Mr. DeWalt also suggests that Mr. Carter failed\nto remedy or protect him from certain Eighth\nAmendment violations by Officer Young, Ms.\nBiester, and Mr. Murray. Because Mr. DeWalt\ncannot state an Eighth Amendment claim against\nany of these defendants, however, we will not\naddress this possible claim. In any event, such a\nclaim would fail for the same reason his other\nclaims against Mr. Carter fail. See Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 833-38 (negligence insufficient to state\nEighth Amendment claim).\n\f</pre>",
