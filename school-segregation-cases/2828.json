We hope that this\r\n\nopinion will  bring the matter  to a close,  for a decade  of\r\n\nlitigation about a single, narrow event is enough.\r\n\n                             I.\r\n\n     The case  began  in February  1988 when  Walter  Biggins\r\n\nbrought suit in district  court against his former  employer,\r\n\nHazen \r                 Paper \r                       Company, and its two principals, Robert Hazen, the\r\n\npresident, and his cousin, Thomas Hazen, the treasurer.   The\r\n\ncompany \r                   is \r                      a \r                        small but successful maker of specialty papers of\r\n\nvarious \r                   kinds.  Biggins joined the company in 1977, at age 52,\r\n\nand \r               served \r                      as its technical director for about nine years.  He\r\n\nhad no written employment contract.\r\n\n     During his employ,  Biggins developed a superior  water-\r\n\nbased paper coating  that increased the company's sales.   He\r\n\nsought a  larger  salary, was  given  a small  increase,  but\r\n\nremained unsatisfied and sought a further increase.   Biggins\r\n\nlater  claimed that  in 1984  Thomas Hazen  had promised  him\r\n\ncompany stock instead of a further raise; Thomas Hazen denied\r\n\nmaking any such promise.\r\n\n     Biggins, during  his  employ by  the company,  was  also\r\n\ninvolved \r                    in \r                       two different ventures with his sons.  When Thomas\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nHazen learned of this, he sought a confidentiality  agreement\r\n\nfrom Biggins, limiting his outside activities during, and for\r\n\na \r             limited \r                     time \r                         after, \r                                his employment with the company.  Biggins\r\n\nrefused to sign, except in exchange for the stock he said had\r\n\nbeen promised.  He  was discharged in June 1986--a few  weeks\r\n\nbefore  his  rights under  the  company  pension  plan  would\r\n\notherwise have vested.\r\n\n     Biggins then  sued  the company  and the  Hazen  cousins\r\n\n(collectively \"the Hazens\") in an eight-count complaint.  The\r\n\nfirst two counts charged  the Hazens with age  discrimination\r\n\nunder the  ADEA and  interference with  pension rights  under\r\n\nERISA.1  The remaining claims, of limited importance to  this\r\n\nappeal (except  for the  contract claim),  were for  wrongful\r\n\ndeprivation \r                       of \r                         property, \r                                   wrongful discharge, fraud, conversion,\r\n\nbreach of contract and  violation of the Massachusetts  Civil\r\n\nRights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, SS 11H and 11I.\r\n\n     In \r                   substance, Biggins claimed under the first two counts,\r\n\nrespectively,\r                         that he had been fired on account of his age--he\r\n\nwas \r               replaced \r                        with a younger man--and to prevent the vesting of\r\n\nhis \r               pension. \r                         \r                        In \r                           additional counts, he also sought the value of\r\n\nthe \r               stock \r                    allegedly \r                              promised by Thomas Hazen and the benefit of\r\n\nthe \r               paper-coating formula and method, which Biggins claimed to\r\n\nown. \r                 \r                 The \r                    gravamen \r                             of \r                                the remaining counts was that he had been\r\n\n  \r              \r               \r                \r                 \r                  \r                   \r                    \r                     \r                     1ADEA \r                          is \r                             the \r                                 Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29\r\nU.S.C. S  621, et seq. and  ERISA is the Employee  Retirement\r\nIncome Security Act, 29 U.S.C. S 1001 et seq.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nwrongfully \r                      discharged in violation of various rights protected\r\n\nunder state law.\r\n\n     In  its verdict,  the  jury  largely  accepted  Biggins'\r\n\nposition, apart from  his claim to ownership of the  formula,\r\n\nwhich it rejected.  On  the ADEA claim, the jury awarded  him\r\n\naround $560,000; the ERISA award was $100,000, later adjusted\r\n\ndownward to  $93,000 on  appeal.   The  fraud award  for  the\r\n\nallegedly \r                     promised stock was about $315,000.  Biggins was also\r\n\nawarded just  under $267,000  for discharge  in violation  of\r\n\ncontract.   On two other  counts, only  nominal damages  were\r\n\nawarded.\r\n\n     Because the jury found  that the age discrimination  was\r\n\nwillful, the award on the ADEA count would normally have been\r\n\ndoubled, \r                    see\r                        \r                       29 \r                          U.S.C. \r                                 S \r                                   626(b), but the district court granted\r\n\njudgment  n.o.v. in  favor  of the  Hazens  on the  issue  of\r\n\nwillfulness. \r                         In other respects, the district court upheld the\r\n\njury verdict against various post-trial motions.  We  reserve\r\n\nfor later discussion the issue of attorney's fees, which  the\r\n\ndistrict court also addressed.\r\n\n     On appeal, a  panel of this court affirmed the  district\r\n\ncourt \r                 with \r                     several \r                             exceptions.  Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 953\r\n\nF.2d \r                1405 \r                     (1st Cir. 1992).  Two are pertinent here: first, the\r\n\npanel found  that the evidence  on the  ADEA count  supported\r\n\ndamages \r                   (before \r                          doubling) of only about $420,000, but the panel\r\n\nalso \r                reinstated \r                          the \r                              willfulness finding and doubled the reduced\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\naward to about $840,000.  Id. at 1416.  Second, the panel set\r\n\naside the  contract  claim  verdict for  lack  of  sufficient\r\n\nevidence to establish a contract.  Id. at 1421-24.    \r\n\n     The \r                    Supreme \r                            Court then granted certiorari and vacated the\r\n\npanel \r                 decision on the ADEA count.  Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,\r\n\n507 U.S. 604 (1993).  The Court held that the panel had  been\r\n\nmistaken in relying  upon the ERISA  violation to supply  the\r\n\nwrongful motive for the ADEA violation; it said that pensions\r\n\nmight \r                 often \r                       correlate with age but a firing to prevent pension\r\n\nvesting \r                   did \r                       not itself amount to a firing based upon age.  Id.\r\n\nat 611-13.\r\n\n     The  Supreme Court  remanded the  case to  the panel  to\r\n\nreconsider \r                      whether the jury had sufficient evidence to find an\r\n\nADEA violation once the ERISA violation was put to one  side.\r\n\n507 U.S. at 614.  On remand, the original panel  reconsidered\r\n\nthe \r               ADEA \r                    claim.  In a second opinion in October 1993, it ruled\r\n\nthat \r                even \r                     disregarding the ERISA violation, enough evidence of\r\n\nage  discrimination remained  to  sustain the  ADEA  verdict,\r\n\nreduced and then doubled as before.\r\n\n     The \r                    Hazens \r                           then petitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing\r\n\ninter \r                 alia \r                      that the panel had misconstrued a pertinent Supreme\r\n\nCourt decision issued shortly after its remand in this  case,\r\n\nHicks  v. St. Mary's  Honor Center, 113  S. Ct. 2742  (1993).\r\n\nAfter soliciting memoranda,  the en banc  court in June  1994\r\n\nordered a  new trial on the  ADEA count, concluding that  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nverdict \r                   on \r                      this \r                          count \r                                had been contaminated by the same mistake\r\n\nthat had led the  Supreme Court to vacate the original  panel\r\n\ndecision.\r\n\n     Biggins  unsuccessfully   sought  rehearing   and   then\r\n\npetitioned the Supreme Court for review, arguing that the  en\r\n\nbanc court had  no power to  order a new  trial and that  the\r\n\ndecision to do so violated the Supreme Court's mandate.   The\r\n\nSupreme \r                   Court \r                        denied \r                               cert\r                                   iorari.  In re Biggins, 115 S. Ct. 614\r\n\n(1994). \r                    \r                    In \r                       April 1996, the district court held a new two-week\r\n\njury \r                trial \r                      on the ADEA count.  The jury returned a verdict for\r\n\nthe Hazens.  \r\n\n     After \r                      various \r                             post-trial \r                                        motions, Biggins filed the appeal\r\n\nnow \r               before \r                      us; a cross-appeal was filed by the Hazens relating\r\n\nonly \r                to \r                   attorney's fees.  We begin with the attacks by Biggins\r\n\nupon the  en banc court's  remand for a  new trial, and  then\r\n\naddress his claims of error in the second trial.   Attorney's\r\n\nfees \r                issues, \r                        raised \r                              by \r                                 the Hazens' cross-appeal, are considered\r\n\nat the close. \r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     Biggins' challenge to the en banc order requiring a  new\r\n\ntrial \r                 is, \r                    strictly \r                             speaking, addressed to the wrong bench.  The\r\n\narguments  that  the remand  was  unlawful  or  unsound  were\r\n\npresented to the en  banc court in a petition for  rehearing,\r\n\nrejected \r                    there, \r                           and \r                              then \r                                   presented in a petition for certiorari\r\n\nwhich the Supreme Court denied.

DeJesus,\r\n\n752 F.2d 640, 642-43 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\n\n     Nevertheless, it may be helpful to explain why  Biggins'\r\n\narguments  relating to  authority of  the en  banc court  are\r\n\nmistaken. \r                      \r                     His \r                         constitutional argument amounts to this:  first,\r\n\nthe  Seventh  Amendment  prohibits  any  federal  court  from\r\n\nreexamining jury findings \"otherwise . . . than according  to\r\n\nthe \r               rules \r                     of \r                        common law\"; and second, in Biggins' view, the en\r\n\nbanc court's new trial order overturned the jury findings  of\r\n\nage  discrimination--without   any  identified  legal   error\r\n\ncommitted by the district court.\r\n\n     This \r                     last \r                         qualification \r                                       is critical.  Where there is legal\r\n\nerror, appeals courts often overturn jury verdicts, and order\r\n\nnew \r               trials \r                      or even dismissal.  This occurs, for example, where\r\n\nevidence \r                    has \r                       been \r                            wrongly admitted, or where an instruction was\r\n\nmistaken,  or  even  where the  evidence  did  not  permit  a\r\n\nreasonable jury to reach the verdict rendered.

The court's appraisal, as noted\r\n\nearlier, was that the jury was potentially misled by the same\r\n\nerror that the  Supreme Court identified  in the first  panel\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\ndecision, namely, a belief that the wrongful motive  (pension\r\n\ninterference) that gave rise to an ERISA violation by  itself\r\n\nconstituted \r                       wrongful motive under ADEA.  Whether or not the en\r\n\nbanc\r                \r                court's \r                        assessment of prejudice was invincibly supported,\r\n\nthe \r               en \r                  banc \r                       court was free under the Seventh Amendment to make\r\n\nthat judgment.2\r\n\n     Biggins' \r                         other challenge to the en banc court's authority\r\n\nis also wide of  the mark.  He  argues that when the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt \r                 remanded the case to this court, it precluded this court\r\n\nfrom taking  any action other than  an up-or-down vote as  to\r\n\nwhether enough evidence remained to support the ADEA verdict.\r\n\nTherefore, says Biggins,  the en banc court has violated  the\r\n\nSupreme Court's mandate.   \r\n\n     Of course, a higher  court's mandate must be  respected,\r\n\nSprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 168 (1939),  but\r\n\nthe issue here is the scope of the mandate.  Where as  here a\r\n\njudgment is vacated and the matter remanded, Hazen Paper Co.,\r\n\n507 U.S. at 617, the lower court must undo the judgment  just\r\n\nvacated and  cannot normally revisit  a legal issue  actually\r\n\ndecided \r                   by \r                      the reviewing court.  But after that, the situation\r\n\nis less rigid than Biggins assumes.\r\n\n          2The concern did not come out of the blue.  Biggins\r\nhad relied in  his complaint upon the deprivation of  pension\r\nbenefits \r                    as \r                       an act of age discrimination and had made the same\r\nargument on appeal.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     On remand, courts are often confronted with issues  that\r\n\nwere never considered by the remanding court.  And\r\n\n               the   mandate  of   an  appellate   court\r\n     forecloses  the  lower  court  from   reconsidering\r\n     matters  determined  in  the  appellate  court,  it\r\n     `leaves \r                        to \r                           the [lower] court any issue not expressly\r\n     or \r                   impliedly \r                             disposed of on appeal.'

United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. 1986).\r\n\n            ing, mandates require respect for what the higher\r                 although\r            Broadly \r                   speak\r\n\ncourt decided, not for what it did not decide.3      \r\n\n     Here, the en banc court concluded that the contamination\r\n\nof the ADEA verdict required a new trial, even assuming  that\r\n\nthe remaining evidence might otherwise support a verdict  for\r\n\nBiggins on  that claim.  Whether  this judgment was right  or\r\n\nwrong--and we cannot revisit it--the contamination issue  had\r\n\ncertainly not been addressed in the Supreme Court's  opinion.\r\n\nAnd when Biggins made his mandate argument on certiorari, the\r\n\nSupreme Court denied the petition.\r\n\n                            III.\r\n\n     The \r                    next \r                         claim of error presents the most difficult issue\r\n\nin the case.  Prior to the start of the second trial, motions\r\n\nin \r              limine \r                     were filed by both sides.

Specifically,  Biggins\r\n\nasked that the Hazens  be precluded at trial from showing  or\r\n\narguing (and we quote):\r\n\n     --   that \r                          the \r                              plaintiff was not fired, but left\r\n          work voluntarily,\r\n     --   and/or  that  the  plaintiff  was   fired\r\n          because he was a disloyal employee,\r\n     --   and/or that  the  plaintiff's  disloyalty\r\n          created a  need  for  the  defendants  to\r\n          dictate  that   he  sign  a   restrictive\r\n          agreement.\r\n\n     In a  second in limine  motion, Biggins  asked that  the\r\n\nHazens also be precluded from showing or arguing that Biggins\r\n\nwas seeking additional compensation when, in Spring 1986,  he\r\n\nconditioned his signing  of the confidentiality agreement  on\r\n\nbeing given stock.  Biggins claimed that the first trial  had\r\n\ndetermined \r                      that \r                           he \r                             had \r                                 been promised the stock in 1984 and that\r\n\nthe \r               company \r                       had been found liable for fraud in withholding the\r\n\nstock.\r\n\n     The district judge rejected both in limine motions after\r\n\nan \r              oral \r                   hearing, expressing some doubt but concluding that the\r\n\nen \r              banc \r                   court had intended a full new trial on the ADEA count.\r\n\nThe \r               judge \r                     said (and Biggins readily agreed) that it could make\r\n\nthe new  trial an empty  gesture if the  jury were told  that\r\n\nBiggins \r                   was \r                       an \r                         innocent \r                                  victim who had been fired by the Hazens\r\n\nas  part of  an effort  to defraud  Biggins.   The court  did\r\n\ninstruct  the jury that  Biggins had been  fired and had  not\r\n\nresigned.\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                        -10-\r\r\n\n     Collateral estoppel, now often called issue  preclusion,\r\n\nprevents a party  from relitigating at a second trial  issues\r\n\ndetermined between  the  same  parties by  an  earlier  final\r\n\njudgment--sub\r                        ject to various limitations.

But the limitations  have\r\n\nbeen slowly diluted  over time and most are irrelevant  here.\r\n\nNor do the Hazens dispute  that the jury verdict in favor  of\r\n\nBiggins at the  first trial is now  final except on the  ADEA\r\n\ncount.\r\n\n     The \r                    Hazens' \r                            main argument against collateral estoppel has\r\n\nbeen \r                that \r                     the \"issues\" in the two cases were different because\r\n\nnothing in the first trial validly determined that the Hazens\r\n\nhad \r               been \r                    motivated by age in firing Biggins (since the Supreme\r\n\nCourt had vacated this claim).   This won't wash.  True,  age\r\n\nmotivation is usually the ultimate issue under the ADEA;  but\r\n\ncollateral estoppel is no longer limited to ultimate  issues:\r\n\nnecessary intermediate findings can  now be used to  preclude\r\n\nrelitigation.\r                          Grella v.

But in this  case\r\n\nthe special verdict  form and reasonable inference  indicates\r\n\nthat several \"facts\"  were determined by  the jury on  counts\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                        -11-\r\r\n\nother \r                 than \r                      ADEA: \r                           (1) \r                               that Biggins was fired, (2) that the stock\r\n\nhad been promised to him, and  (3) that (in the words of  the\r\n\nverdict form) \"defendants wrongfully discharged plaintiff  in\r\n\norder to deprive plaintiff of the promised stock compensation\r\n\n. . . .\"\r\n\n     At \r                   the \r                       new \r                          trial, \r                                 the \r                                     jury was instructed that Biggins had\r\n\nbeen  fired, so that is out of  the case.  But on the  second\r\n\nissue Biggins says  that the Hazens relitigated the issue  of\r\n\nwhether \r                   they \r                       had \r                           promised him stock, and that appears to be the\r\n\ncase.   A  good  argument can  be  made that  under  standard\r\n\ncollateral estoppel doctrine, the Hazens should not have been\r\n\nallowed \r                   to \r                      relitigate the issue whether \"in fact\" Thomas Hazen\r\n\nhad promised the stock  to Biggins, a point about which  both\r\n\nBiggins and Hazen told largely inconsistent stories.\r\n\n     Yet \r                    if \r                       there \r                            was \r                                error, \r                                       we regard it as harmless.  Whether\r\n\nthe stock was  promised has little relevance to the  question\r\n\nwhether the  Hazens engaged in  age discrimination when  they\r\n\nfired Biggins.   Biggins argues that the Hazens purported  to\r\n\nfire him  because  he  refused to  sign  the  confidentiality\r\n\nagreement \r                     and \r                        therefore\r                                  \r                                  the stock promise was relevant, Biggins\r\n\nhaving \r                  offered \r                          to \r                            sign \r                                 in exchange for the promised stock.  But\r\n\nBiggins' \r                    refusal to sign does not vanish as a plausible motive\r\n\nfor the  Hazens,  regardless  of whether  stock  was  wrongly\r\n\nwithheld.\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                        -12-\r\r\n\n     Obviously  the Hazens  wanted to  relitigate the  stock-\r\n\npromise issue, and Biggins to foreclose relitigation, because\r\n\nthe Hazens look  worse--from the standpoint of  character--if\r\n\nthey were welshing on a promise and Biggins looks worse if he\r\n\nwere making  new  demands.   But  character evidence  is  not\r\n\nnormally admissible  to show conformity  therewith.  Fed.  R.\r\n\nEvid. \r                 404(a).  Thus, the permissible use of the evidence about\r\n\nthe promise  was very limited  so far as  the ADEA claim  was\r\n\nconcerned; properly used,  it added  useful context,  nothing\r\n\nmore.\r\n\n     Turning to the third \"fact\" in issue, we reject Biggins'\r\n\nclaim  that the jury  should have been  told that the  Hazens\r\n\nfraudulently discharged Biggins  to deprive  him of  promised\r\n\nstock. \r                   \r                   How \r                      such \r                           an \r                              instruction would be understood is unclear:\r\n\nthe Hazens say that (by supplying a different motive) it cuts\r\n\nagainst Biggins'  current  claim that  he was  discharged  on\r\n\naccount \r                   of \r                      age; \r                          on \r                             the \r                                 other hand, Biggins would obviously have\r\n\nliked the  new jury to hear  the terms \"fraud\" and  \"wrongful\r\n\ndischarge\" as a dual motive.\r\n\n     The \r                    problem \r                            the \r                               jury \r                                    confronted on retrial was to sort out\r\n\nany age discrimination motive in the tangle of other possible\r\n\nmotivations,  including  perceived  disloyalty,  compensation\r\n\nquarrels, and the like.  We think that it would badly distort\r\n\nmatters to tell the jury  that in carrying out this task,  it\r\n\nmust accept that the Hazens' motivation in firing Biggins was\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                        -13-\r\r\n\nwrongful or fraudulent.   The glare from such an  instruction\r\n\nwould distort any effort to distinguish shadows or shades  in\r\n\nthe Hazens' actual motivation.  See Fed. R.

We thus need not decide\r\n\nwhether, even on  the opposite assumption, it would make  any\r\n\nsense to reverse here.   After all, the issues have now  been\r\n\nrelitigated, collateral estoppel  is a  doctrine of  judicial\r\n\neconomy, \r                    and \r                        one \r                           might \r                                 wonder whether--assuming no other error-\r\n\n-such \r                 an \r                    objective would be served by a third trial.

Only the contract claim  and one of the  six\r\n\nclaimed \r                   trial errors require any discussion; the other alleged\r\n\nerrors \r                  are \r                      fairly \r                            raised \r                                   but are answered by the Hazens and are\r\n\nof no general interest.\r\n\n         4Biggins also argues that the second jury should  have\r\nbeen told that at the prior  trial, Biggins had been found to  be\r\nloyal.  There is no indication from the special verdict that  the\r\nfirst jury made a generic finding of \"loyalty.\"\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                        -14-\r\r\n\n     Biggins' \r                         strongest \r                                  claim \r                                        of error, which we do address, is\r\n\nthat \r                the \r                    district court on retrial erred by excluding evidence\r\n\nof \r              his \r                  pension \r                         status \r                                and the Hazens' effort to deprive Biggins\r\n\nof  his unvested  pension  plan  benefits  upon  termination.\r\n\nBiggins \r                   says \r                       that \r                            without this information, the jury was misled\r\n\nby the  Hazens' effort  at the  second trial  to portray  the\r\n\ncompany \r                   as \r                      a \r                       generous \r                                employer willing to provide such benefits\r\n\nfor Biggins.\r\n\n     The \r                    Hazens \r                           argue \r                                that \r                                     the attempted pension termination is\r\n\nirrelevant: \r                       they \r                           say \r                               that Biggins can collect only once for the\r\n\nwrongful  termination  of his  pension,  and  this  loss  was\r\n\ncompensated \r                       by the earlier award on the ERISA count.  But that\r\n\nis  beside the point:   facts underlying  one claim could  be\r\n\npertinent to  a different  claim, regardless  of whether  the\r\n\nformer \r                  claim \r                        had been satisfied.  Still, the Hazens also argue\r\n\nthat \r                in \r                   this \r                        instance the Supreme Court expressly decided that\r\n\ninterference with pension vesting is not age discrimination.\r\n\n     Actually, \r                          the Supreme Court reserved the possibility that\r\n\npension  evidence might  occasionally be  relevant where  the\r\n\nemployer is shown consciously  to equate pension status  with\r\n\nage, Hazen Paper  Co., 507 U.S. at  612-613; but that is  not\r\n\nBiggins' argument here.  Rather, what Biggins wanted the jury\r\n\nto infer from  the pension interference  finding is that  the\r\n\nHazens are  not as nice as they claim to be.  Again, this  is\r\n\nlargely \r                   forbidden character evidence, although the trial court\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                        -15-\r\r\n\nhas some latitude since  the evidence can also be treated  as\r\n\ncontext.\r\n\n     Still,  in regard  to  age discrimination,  the  Hazens'\r\n\ngenerosity vel  non  is at  best  marginally relevant.    The\r\n\ndistrict  court had every  reason to worry,  in light of  the\r\n\nSupreme Court and en banc decisions, that undue attention  to\r\n\npension termination would prompt yet another reversal.   Even\r\n\nif \r              some \r                   narrow \r                         path \r                              could have been followed--e.g., by limiting\r\n\ninstructions--the district court was within its discretion in\r\n\ndeclining to do so.   See United States v. Houlihan, 92  F.3d\r\n\n1297 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 963 (1997).\r\n\n     Biggins' other claim relates to his post-verdict motion.\r\n\nFollowing the second trial, Biggins filed a motion to  reopen\r\n\nthe adverse judgment on the contract claim, relying upon Fed.\r\n\nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(6), which permits the court to undo a  final\r\n\njudgment.    His  claim was  that  a  recent  state  decision\r\n\nundermined \r                      the \r                         panel's \r                                 earlier rejection of the contract claim.\r\n\nThe district court denied the motion.\r\n\n     To understand this Rule 60(b) claim, one must return  to\r\n\nthe \r               original \r                       proceedings.  In the first trial, the jury awarded\r\n\nBiggins \r                   about \r                        $267,000 \r                                 on his breach of contract claim; Biggins\r\n\nclaimed that the  company's \"employee  handbook\" comprised  a\r\n\ncontract  under  Jackson  v.  Action  for  Boston   Community\r\n\nDevelopment, Inc.,  525  N.E.2d 411  (Mass. 1988),  and  that\r\n\nprotections it afforded against discharge had been denied  to\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                        -16-\r\r\n\nhim.   Jackson had  held that \"on  proper proof, a  personnel\r\n\nmanual can be shown to form the basis of [such] an express or\r\n\nimplied contract.\"  525 N.E.2d at 414.  \r\n\n     On the first  appeal, the panel  set aside the  contract\r\n\nclaim award.  The panel noted that there was no evidence that\r\n\nthe  handbook  had  been  incorporated  into  a  contract  by\r\n\nnegotiation or that either Biggins or the company had treated\r\n\nthe handbook as a contract  between them.  953 F.2d at  1423.\r\n\nThe \r               panel \r                     held that a judgment n.o.v. should have been granted\r\n\nand \r               vacated \r                       the \r                          award. \r                                  \r                                  That disposition, like the several jury\r\n\nawards to  Biggins that were  not further  challenged by  the\r\n\nHazens, became final.\r\n\n     In the  Rule 60(b) motion,  Biggins argued  that a  more\r\n\nrecent decision of the state's highest court, O'Brien v.  New\r\n\nEngland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, 664 N.E.2d 843  (Mass.\r\n\n1996), conflicts  with the panel's  earlier treatment of  the\r\n\ncontract \r                    issue in 1992.  We agree that the panel's disposition\r\n\nof the contract  claim might have been different had  O'Brien\r\n\nbeen \r                decided \r                        earlier: \r                                 \r                                 its tone and language are more favorable\r\n\nto such  recoveries than Jackson.   While there is no  direct\r\n\ncontradiction, O'Brien is  a gradual  extension of  precedent\r\n\n(Jackson\r                    \r                    was \r                       itself \r                              an \r                                 extension of an earlier case) typical of\r\n\ncommon-law jurisprudence.  \r\n\n     Yet the case law is  very hostile to using a mistake  of\r\n\nstate \r                 law, \r                      still less a change in state common law, as grounds\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                        -17-\r\r\n\nfor a motion to reopen a final judgment under Rule  60(b)(6).\r\n\n  though                               cf. Polites v.  United\r\n\nStates\r                 , \r                   364 \r                       U.S. 426, 433 (1960), there is good sense--as well\r\n\nas much precedent--to make this the rarest of possibilities.5\r            Al       the door is not quite closed, \r\n\nDecisions constantly  are  being  made by  judges  which,  if\r\n\nreassessed in light of later precedent, might have been  made\r\n\ndifferently; but a final judgment normally ends the quarrel.\r\n\n     Indeed, the common  law could not safely develop if  the\r\n\nlatest \r                  evolution in doctrine became the standard for measuring\r\n\npreviously \r                      resolved \r                              claims.  The finality of judgments protects\r\n\nagainst \r                   this \r                        kind of retroactive lawmaking.  Admittedly, there\r\n\nis some arbitrariness  (e.g., \"new law\"  is applied in  cases\r\n\nstill \r                 on \r                    direct \r                          appeal); \r                                   but, by the same token, Jackson itself\r\n\nhad not been decided  when the Hazens first handed out  their\r\n\nemployee handbook.\r\n\n     Biggins says that the abuse of discretion standard under\r\n\nRule 60(b) should not shield the district court in this case,\r\n\nsince  that  court may  have  thought  itself  disabled  from\r\n\nreconsidering the panel's holding on the contract award.  But\r\n\nabsent extraordinary circumstances, we would think it dubious\r\n\npractice \r                    to \r                       reopen a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) solely\r\n\nbecause of later precedent pointing in a different direction.\r\n\n  \r              \r               \r                \r                 \r                  \r                   \r                    \r                     \r                     5Se\r                        e, e.g., Batta v.

To understand the  issues\r\n\nrequires \r                    us \r                       to retrace several steps, beginning again with the\r\n\nfirst  trial.  After  that trial, the  district court in  two\r\n\nstages \r                  awarded Biggins a total of about $207,000 in fees (plus\r\n\ncosts), reflecting Biggins' success on both the ADEA and  the\r\n\nERISA claims. \r\n\n     Attorney's \r                           fees \r                               are \r                                   mandatory for the successful plaintiff\r\n\nunder the ADEA and  permissible under ERISA, see 29 U.S.C.  S\r\n\n626(b); \r                   29 \r                      U.S.C. S 1140; as to the latter, the district court\r\n\nexercised its discretion in favor of an award.  No such  fees\r\n\nwere available  for the  common-law claims  on which  Biggins\r\n\nrecovered substantial damages, namely, fraud and discharge in\r\n\nviolation of contract.  The award for the two federal  claims\r\n\nwas based upon straight time and upon hourly rates not now in\r\n\nissue.\r\n\n     After   the   first   panel   opinion,   Biggins--having\r\n\nsuccessfully defended his  verdicts on both federal  claims--\r\n\nsought an additional  award of attorney's fees and costs  for\r\n\nappellate work.   In March  1992, the  panel awarded  Biggins\r\n\nadditional fees of  just under $72,000.   There followed  the\r\n\nSupreme Court remand of  the ADEA claim and the second  panel\r\n\n                            -19-\r                                        -19-\r\r\n\nopinion where Biggins, again successful on that claim, sought\r\n\nfurther attorney's fees in November 1993.\r\n\n     However, \r                         in \r                            June 1994, the en banc court vacated the ADEA\r\n\naward, ordering a new trial.  In a companion order, the panel\r\n\ndeclined \r                    to \r                       award any additional fees for the first appeal, as\r\n\nsought by Biggins,  and said that  the remainder of  Biggins'\r\n\napplication for additional fees had been rendered moot by the\r\n\nen banc order.  The case then returned to the district  court\r\n\nwhere the new trial occurred in April 1996.  \r\n\n     After \r                      the \r                          second \r                                trial, \r                                       Biggins sought to execute judgment\r\n\non \r              the \r                  prior \r                        awards of attorney's fees (just over $207,000 for\r\n\nthe \r               first \r                     trial \r                          and \r                              almost  $72,000 for the first appeal).  The\r\n\nHazens, by contrast, moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5)  to\r\n\nreopen the  judgment and reduce  the previously awarded  fees\r\n\nbecause \r                   Biggins was no longer the prevailing party on the ADEA\r\n\nclaim. \r                   \r                   In \r                     July \r                          1996, \r                                the district court resolved the matter in\r\n\na detailed memorandum, pointing  out that he was  \"intimately\r\n\nfamiliar\" with the case.\r\n\n     The district judge  agreed with the Hazens that the  fee\r\n\naward resulting  from the first  trial should be  reexamined,\r\n\nsince \r                 one \r                     predicate (the ADEA award) had now been undone.

He concluded that subtracting  the\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                        -20-\r\r\n\nADEA claim from the first trial would not have  substantially\r\n\nreduced \r                   the \r                       amount of time needed to prepare and try the ERISA\r\n\nclaim on which Biggins had conclusively prevailed.  He  ruled\r\n\nthat  a 20  percent reduction  was warranted  and awarded  80\r\n\npercent of the original $207,000 figure to cover the original\r\n\ntrial.\r\n\n     The \r                    district \r                             court declined to alter the panel's award of\r\n\nalmost $72,000 for the first appeal; that appeal, it will  be\r\n\nremembered, had resulted in affirmance of the ADEA and  ERISA\r\n\nawards, \r                   but \r                       the \r                          ADEA \r                               award had later been undone.  The district\r\n\ncourt \r                 said \r                      that this court had likely considered the matter of\r\n\na \r             reduction \r                       when it remanded for a new trial, and in any case,\r\n\nthat award was the court of appeals' business.\r\n\n     Accordingly, \r                             the \r                                district court entered a revised judgment\r\n\ncovering \r                    the \r                        entire attorney's fees award in both courts.  The\r\n\ntotal is about $237,700, apart  from costs.  It is from  this\r\n\njudgment that the  Hazens have now cross-appealed,  objecting\r\n\nboth \r                to \r                   the \r                      modesty \r                              of \r                                 the 20 percent reduction in the district\r\n\ncourt fee and the refusal to reduce at all the amount awarded\r\n\nby this court for appellate work.\r\n\n     The district  judge's refusal to  order more  than a  20\r\n\npercent reduction is easily sustained.  Most of this case has\r\n\nfocused throughout on a central event, Biggins' firing, in an\r\n\neffort  to  appraise  the  Hazens'  reason  or  reasons;  but\r\n\nmotivation had to be discerned through examination of several\r\n\n                            -21-\r                                        -21-\r\r\n\ncontroversies\r                         that had enveloped the parties and led up to the\r\n\nfiring, including Biggins' other ventures and claim to  stock\r\n\nownership.\r\n\n     A \r                  trial \r                        of \r                           the firing and related background events would\r\n\nhave been  quite extensive,  and probably  pretty similar  in\r\n\ncontour, even  if Biggins  had brought  only one  of the  two\r\n\nfederal \r                   claims. \r                            \r                           Indeed, \r                                   the second trial was nominally limited\r\n\nto  the  ADEA  claim,  but  its  duration  and  breadth  were\r\n\nconsiderable.   The commonality  of issues  has already  been\r\n\nnoted, in the Hazens' favor, sustaining their evidence as  to\r\n\nbackground matters in the second trial.\r\n\n     In \r                   all \r                       events, \r                              the \r                                  Hazens make no effort to show in detail\r\n\nthat \r                the \r                    20 \r                      percent \r                              reduction understates the time savings from\r\n\n(hypothetically) eliminating the  ADEA claim  from the  first\r\n\ntrial.  Instead, they rely mainly upon doctrine, namely, that\r\n\nwhere \r\n\n     a plaintiff has  achieved only  partial or  limited\r\n     success, \r                         the \r                             product of hours reasonably expended on\r\n     the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly\r\n     rate may be an  excessive amount. . . . even  where\r\n     the plaintiff's claims were interrelated . . . .  \r\n\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 436 (1983).  \r\n\n     We \r                   say \r                       \"mainly\" \r                               because \r                                       the Hazens also try to make use of\r\n\nBiggins' earlier attempt, in resisting a remand, to  minimize\r\n\nthe importance of the ERISA claim in the first trial.  It  is\r\n\ntrue \r                that \r                     Biggins called the claim little more than \"a blip on\r\n\nthe screen\" but, of course, the en banc court disagreed  with\r\n\n                            -22-\r                                        -22-\r\r\n\nhim.  Catching up counsel on past rhetoric is sometimes fair,\r\n\nbut \r               not \r                   in \r                      the present situation where the  blip  argument was\r\n\nso clearly unsuccessful exaggeration.\r\n\n     This  brings us  back  to Hensley.    Of course,  it  is\r\n\nsometimes \r                     appropriate \r                                to \r                                   discount for failed or non-compensable\r\n\nclaims \r                  where \r                        they \r                            cannot \r                                   be neatly segregated from a successful\r\n\ncompensable one.  But  the district court did discount by  20\r\n\npercent for the failed  ADEA claim; and it took the  original\r\n\n$207,000 \r                    award as already reduced to account for time spent on\r\n\nstate claims that would not have been needed for the  federal\r\n\nclaims.  The former adjustment is obvious; and if the  latter\r\n\nassumption is an error, the Hazens have not shown it.\r\n\n     Finally, \r                         we \r                            come \r                                to \r                                   the \r                                       district court's refusal to reduce\r\n\nthe award of almost $72,000 made by this court for the  first\r\n\nappeal. \r                    \r                    Biggins \r                           says \r                                that this award is no longer open because\r\n\nthe Hazens did  not ask for  a reduction at  the time of  the\r\n\nremand; \r                   the \r                       Hazens say, we think with some justification, that\r\n\nsuch a reduction request would have been premature since  the\r\n\npossibility remained that Biggins would still prevail on  the\r\n\nADEA claim at the second trial.\r\n\n     But this  court is not  inclined to  reopen its  earlier\r\n\n$72,000 award.  In theory, the Hazens have a claim that  time\r\n\nspent on  the first  appeal  as to  the ADEA  issue--among  a\r\n\nconsiderable number of other issues--ought to be  subtracted.\r\n\nBut \r               one \r                   may \r                      doubt, \r                             at \r                                least here, whether much discernable cost\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                        -23-\r\r\n\nis added  by writing  more pages  in an  appellate brief,  to\r\n\naddress one more issue with which counsel is already familiar\r\n\nafter an extensive trial.  \r\n\n     In \r                   refusing \r                            to \r                              reopen \r                                     the earlier award, we also take into\r\n\naccount two  other factors: that  the original panel  earlier\r\n\nrefused \r                   to \r                     enlarge \r                             Biggins' award, despite his offer of further\r\n\ntime \r                records, and that this panel has no intention of making a\r\n\nfurther  award to  Biggins  for time  he  has just  spent  in\r\n\ndefending \r                     his \r                        attorney's \r                                   fee judgment (although it too could be\r\n\nthe \r               subject \r                       of an award in this court's discretion).

We hope that this opinion will bring the matter to a close, for a decade of litigation about a single, narrow event is enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case began in February 1988 when Walter Biggins brought suit in district court against his former employer, Hazen Paper Company, and its two principals, Robert Hazen, the president, and his cousin, Thomas Hazen, the treasurer.  The company is a small but successful maker of specialty papers of various kinds.  Biggins joined the company in 1977, at age 52, and served as its technical director for about nine years.  He had no written employment contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his employ, Biggins developed a superior waterbased paper coating that increased the company's sales.  He sought a larger salary, was given a small increase, but remained unsatisfied and sought a further increase.  Biggins later claimed that in 1984 Thomas Hazen had promised him company stock instead of a further raise;  Thomas Hazen denied making any such promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins, during his employ by the company, was also involved in two different ventures with his sons.  When Thomas Hazen learned of this, he sought a confidentiality agreement from Biggins, limiting his outside activities during, and for a limited time after, his employment with the company.  Biggins refused to sign, except in exchange for the stock he said had been promised.  He was discharged in June 1986--a few weeks before his rights under the company pension plan would otherwise have vested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins then sued the company and the Hazen cousins (collectively \"the Hazens\") in an eight-count complaint.  The first two counts charged the Hazens with age discrimination under the ADEA and interference with pension rights under ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The remaining claims, of limited importance to this appeal (except for the contract claim), were for wrongful deprivation of property, wrongful discharge, fraud, conversion, breach of contract and violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H and 11I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, Biggins claimed under the first two counts, respectively, that he had been fired on account of his age--he was replaced with a younger man--and to prevent the vesting of his pension.  In additional counts, he also sought the value of the stock allegedly promised by Thomas Hazen and the benefit of the paper-coating formula and method, which Biggins claimed to own.  The gravamen of the remaining counts was that he had been wrongfully discharged in violation of various rights protected under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its verdict, the jury largely accepted Biggins' position, apart from his claim to ownership of the formula, which it rejected.  On the ADEA claim, the jury awarded him around $560,000;  the ERISA award was $100,000, later adjusted downward to $93,000 on appeal.  The fraud award for the allegedly promised stock was about $315,000.  Biggins was also awarded just under $267,000 for discharge in violation of contract.  On two other counts, only nominal damages were awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury found that the age discrimination was willful, the award on the ADEA count would normally have been doubled, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b), but the district court granted judgment n.o.v. in favor of the Hazens on the issue of willfulness.  In other respects, the district court upheld the jury verdict against various post-trial motions.  We reserve for later discussion the issue of attorney's fees, which the district court also addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, a panel of this court affirmed the district court with several exceptions.  Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., 953 F.2d 1405 (1st Cir.1992).  Two are pertinent here:  first, the panel found that the evidence on the ADEA count supported damages (before doubling) of only about $420,000, but the panel also reinstated the willfulness finding and doubled the reduced award to about $840,000.  Id. at 1416.   Second, the panel set aside the contract claim verdict for lack of sufficient evidence to establish a contract.  Id. at 1421-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court then granted certiorari and vacated the panel decision on the ADEA count.  Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993).  The Court held that the panel had been mistaken in relying upon the ERISA violation to supply the wrongful motive for the ADEA violation;  it said that pensions might often correlate with age but a firing to prevent pension vesting did not itself amount to a firing based upon age.  Id. at 611-13, 113 S.Ct. at 1706-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court remanded the case to the panel to reconsider whether the jury had sufficient evidence to find an ADEA violation once the ERISA violation was put to one side.  507 U.S. at 614, 113 S.Ct. at 1708.   On remand, the original panel reconsidered the ADEA claim.  In a second opinion in October 1993, it ruled that even disregarding the ERISA violation, enough evidence of age discrimination remained to sustain the ADEA verdict, reduced and then doubled as before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hazens then petitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing inter alia that the panel had misconstrued a pertinent Supreme Court decision issued shortly after its remand in this case, St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).  After soliciting memoranda, the en banc court in June 1994 ordered a new trial on the ADEA count, concluding that the verdict on this count had been contaminated by the same mistake that had led the Supreme Court to vacate the original panel decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins unsuccessfully sought rehearing and then petitioned the Supreme Court for review, arguing that the en banc court had no power to order a new trial and that the decision to do so violated the Supreme Court's mandate.  The Supreme Court denied certiorari.  In re Biggins, 513 U.S. 1013, 115 S.Ct. 614, 130 L.Ed.2d 523 (1994).  In April 1996, the district court held a new two-week jury trial on the ADEA count.  The jury returned a verdict for the Hazens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After various post-trial motions, Biggins filed the appeal now before us;  a cross-appeal was filed by the Hazens relating only to attorney's fees.  We begin with the attacks by Biggins upon the en banc court's remand for a new trial, and then address his claims of error in the second trial.  Attorney's fees issues, raised by the Hazens' cross-appeal, are considered at the close.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins' challenge to the en banc order requiring a new trial is, strictly speaking, addressed to the wrong bench.  The arguments that the remand was unlawful or unsound were presented to the en banc court in a petition for rehearing, rejected there, and then presented in a petition for certiorari which the Supreme Court denied.  It is not open to the panel, in the normal case, to reconsider issues decided earlier in the same case by the en banc court.  See United States v. DeJesus, 752 F.2d 640, 642-43 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, it may be helpful to explain why Biggins' arguments relating to authority of the en banc court are mistaken.  His constitutional argument amounts to this:  first, the Seventh Amendment prohibits any federal court from reexamining jury findings \"otherwise ... than according to the rules of common law\";  and second, in Biggins' view, the en banc court's new trial order overturned the jury findings of age discrimination--without any identified legal error committed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This last qualification is critical.  Where there is legal error, appeals courts often overturn jury verdicts, and order new trials or even dismissal.  This occurs, for example, where evidence has been wrongly admitted, or where an instruction was mistaken, or even where the evidence did not permit a reasonable jury to reach the verdict rendered.

The court's appraisal, as noted earlier, was that the jury was potentially misled by the same error that the Supreme Court identified in the first panel decision, namely, a belief that the wrongful motive (pension interference) that gave rise to an ERISA violation by itself constituted wrongful motive under ADEA.  Whether or not the en banc court's assessment of prejudice was invincibly supported, the en banc court was free under the Seventh Amendment to make that judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins' other challenge to the en banc court's authority is also wide of the mark.  He argues that when the Supreme Court remanded the case to this court, it precluded this court from taking any action other than an up-or-down vote as to whether enough evidence remained to support the ADEA verdict.  Therefore, says Biggins, the en banc court has violated the Supreme Court's mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a higher court's mandate must be respected, Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 168, 59 S.Ct. 777, 780-81, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939), but the issue here is the scope of the mandate.  Where as here a judgment is vacated and the matter remanded, Hazen Paper Co., 507 U.S. at 617, 113 S.Ct. at 1710, the lower court must undo the judgment just vacated and cannot normally revisit a legal issue actually decided by the reviewing court.  But after that, the situation is less rigid than Biggins assumes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, courts are often confronted with issues that were never considered by the remanding court.  And</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>although the mandate of an appellate court forecloses the lower court from reconsidering matters determined in the appellate court, it 'leaves to the [lower] court any issue not expressly or impliedly disposed of on appeal.'

Whether this judgment was right or wrong--and we cannot revisit it--the contamination issue had certainly not been addressed in the Supreme Court's opinion.  And when Biggins made his mandate argument for certiorari, the Supreme Court denied the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next claim of error presents the most difficult issue in the case.  Prior to the start of the second trial, motions in limine were filed by both sides.  One such motion, filed by Biggins, invoked collateral estoppel and asked that the Hazens be barred from relitigating issues decided in the first trial on counts other than the ADEA claim.  Specifically, Biggins asked that the Hazens be precluded at trial from showing or arguing (and we quote):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- that the plaintiff was not fired, but left work voluntarily,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- and/or that the plaintiff was fired because he was a disloyal employee,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- and/or that the plaintiff's disloyalty created a need for the defendants to dictate that he sign a restrictive agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a second in limine motion, Biggins asked that the Hazens also be precluded from showing or arguing that Biggins was seeking additional compensation when, in Spring 1986, he conditioned his signing of the confidentiality agreement on being given stock.  Biggins claimed that the first trial had determined that he had been promised the stock in 1984 and that the company had been found liable for fraud in withholding the stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge rejected both in limine motions after an oral hearing, expressing some doubt but concluding that the en banc court had intended a full new trial on the ADEA count.  The judge said (and Biggins readily agreed) that it could make the new trial an empty gesture if the jury were told that Biggins was an innocent victim who had been fired by the Hazens as part of an effort to defraud Biggins.  The court did instruct the jury that Biggins had been fired and had not resigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collateral estoppel, now often called issue preclusion, prevents a party from relitigating at a second trial issues determined between the same parties by an earlier final judgment--subject to various limitations.  Lundborg v. Phoenix Leasing, Inc., 91 F.3d 265, 271 (1st Cir.1996);  Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 27 (1982).  But the limitations have been slowly diluted over time and most are irrelevant here.  Nor do the Hazens dispute that the jury verdict in favor of Biggins at the first trial is now final except on the ADEA count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hazens' main argument against collateral estoppel has been that the \"issues\" in the two cases were different because nothing in the first trial validly determined that the Hazens had been motivated by age in firing Biggins (since the Supreme Court had vacated this claim).  This won't wash.  True, age motivation is usually the ultimate issue under the ADEA;  but collateral estoppel is no longer limited to ultimate issues:  necessary intermediate findings can now be used to preclude relitigation.  Grella v. Salem Five Cent Savings Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30-31 (1st Cir.1994);  Restatement (Second), Judgments &#167; 27, comment j.  (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Often it is very difficult to prove that the initial trial necessarily decided an intermediate issue.  But in this case the special verdict form and reasonable inference indicates that several \"facts\" were determined by the jury on counts other than ADEA:  (1) that Biggins was fired, (2) that the stock had been promised to him, and (3) that (in the words of the verdict form) \"defendants wrongfully discharged plaintiff in order to deprive plaintiff of the promised stock compensation....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the new trial, the jury was instructed that Biggins had been fired, so that is out of the case.  But on the second issue Biggins says that the Hazens relitigated the issue of whether they had promised him stock, and that appears to be the case.  A good argument can be made that under standard collateral estoppel doctrine, the Hazens should not have been allowed to relitigate the issue whether \"in fact\" Thomas Hazen had promised the stock to Biggins, a point about which both Biggins and Hazen told largely inconsistent stories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet if there was error, we regard it as harmless.  Whether the stock was promised has little relevance to the question whether the Hazens engaged in age discrimination when they fired Biggins.  Biggins argues that the Hazens purported to fire him because he refused to sign the confidentiality agreement and therefore the stock promise was relevant, Biggins having offered to sign in exchange for the promised stock.  But Biggins' refusal to sign does not vanish as a plausible motive for the Hazens, regardless of whether stock was wrongly withheld.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously the Hazens wanted to relitigate the stock-promise issue, and Biggins to foreclose relitigation, because the Hazens look worse--from the standpoint of character--if they were welshing on a promise and Biggins looks worse if he were making new demands.  But character evidence is not normally admissible to show conformity therewith.  Fed.R.Evid. 404(a).  Thus, the permissible use of the evidence about the promise was very limited so far as the ADEA claim was concerned;  properly used, it added useful context, nothing more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the third \"fact\" in issue, we reject Biggins' claim that the jury should have been told that the Hazens fraudulently discharged Biggins to deprive him of promised stock.  How such an instruction would be understood is unclear:  the Hazens say that (by supplying a different motive) it cuts against Biggins' current claim that he was discharged on account of age;  on the other hand, Biggins would obviously have liked the new jury to hear the terms \"fraud\" and \"wrongful discharge\" as a dual motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem the jury confronted on retrial was to sort out any age discrimination motive in the tangle of other possible motivations, including perceived disloyalty, compensation quarrels, and the like.  We think that it would badly distort matters to tell the jury that in carrying out this task, it must accept that the Hazens' motivation in firing Biggins was wrongful or fraudulent.  The glare from such an instruction would distort any effort to distinguish shadows or shades in the Hazens' actual motivation.  See Fed.R.Evid. 403.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, there was no prejudicial error in this challenged refusal to apply collateral estoppel.  We thus need not decide whether, even on the opposite assumption, it would make any sense to reverse here.  After all, the issues have now been relitigated, collateral estoppel is a doctrine of judicial economy, and one might wonder whether--assuming no other error-such an objective would be served by a third trial.  Cf. Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 476 n. 5 (1st Cir.1994) (court of appeals will not review denial of summary judgment motion after a full trial and an adverse jury verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the two large claims of error--the attack on the en banc order and the collateral estoppel claim--Biggins makes six shorter claims of trial error and also seeks to resurrect the contract claim found insufficient by the first panel opinion.  Only the contract claim and one of the six claimed trial errors require any discussion;  the other alleged errors are fairly raised but are answered by the Hazens and are of no general interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins' strongest claim of error, which we do address, is that the district court on retrial erred by excluding evidence of his pension status and the Hazens' effort to deprive Biggins of his unvested pension plan benefits upon termination.  Biggins says that without this information, the jury was misled by the Hazens' effort at the second trial to portray the company as a generous employer willing to provide such benefits for Biggins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hazens argue that the attempted pension termination is irrelevant:  they say that Biggins can collect only once for the wrongful termination of his pension, and this loss was compensated by the earlier award on the ERISA count.  But that is beside the point:  facts underlying one claim could be pertinent to a different claim, regardless of whether the former claim had been satisfied.  Still, the Hazens also argue that in this instance the Supreme Court expressly decided that interference with pension vesting is not age discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Actually, the Supreme Court reserved the possibility that pension evidence might occasionally be relevant where the employer is shown consciously to equate pension status with age, Hazen Paper Co., 507 U.S. at 612-13, 113 S.Ct. at 1707-08;  but that is not Biggins' argument here.  Rather, what Biggins wanted the jury to infer from the pension interference finding is that the Hazens are not as nice as they claim to be.  Again, this is largely forbidden character evidence, although the trial court has some latitude since the evidence can also be treated as context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, in regard to age discrimination, the Hazens' generosity vel non is at best marginally relevant.  The district court had every reason to worry, in light of the Supreme Court and en banc decisions, that undue attention to pension termination would prompt yet another reversal.  Even if some narrow path could have been followed--e.g., by limiting instructions--the district court was within its discretion in declining to do so.  See United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 963, 136 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins' other claim relates to his post-verdict motion.  Following the second trial, Biggins filed a motion to reopen the adverse judgment on the contract claim, relying upon Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), which permits the court to undo a final judgment.  His claim was that a recent state decision undermined the panel's earlier rejection of the contract claim.  The district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand this Rule 60(b) claim, one must return to the original proceedings.  In the first trial, the jury awarded Biggins about $267,000 on his breach of contract claim;  Biggins claimed that the company's \"employee handbook\" comprised a contract under Jackson v. Action for Boston Community Development, Inc., 403 Mass. 8, 525 N.E.2d 411 (1988), and that protections it afforded against discharge had been denied to him.  Jackson had held that \"on proper proof, a personnel manual can be shown to form the basis of [such] an express or implied contract.\"  525 N.E.2d at 414.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first appeal, the panel set aside the contract claim award.  The panel noted that there was no evidence that the handbook had been incorporated into a contract by negotiation or that either Biggins or the company had treated the handbook as a contract between them.  953 F.2d at 1423.   The panel held that a judgment n.o.v. should have been granted and vacated the award.  That disposition, like the several jury awards to Biggins that were not further challenged by the Hazens, became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Rule 60(b) motion, Biggins argued that a more recent decision of the state's highest court, O'Brien v. New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, 422 Mass. 686, 664 N.E.2d 843 (1996), conflicts with the panel's earlier treatment of the contract issue in 1992.  We agree that the panel's disposition of the contract claim might have been different had O'Brien been decided earlier:  its tone and language are more favorable to such recoveries than Jackson.   While there is no direct contradiction, O'Brien is a gradual extension of precedent (Jackson was itself an extension of an earlier case) typical of common-law jurisprudence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the case law is very hostile to using a mistake of state law, still less a change in state common law, as grounds for a motion to reopen a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6).  Although the door is not quite closed, cf.  Polites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426, 433, 81 S.Ct. 202, 206-07, 5 L.Ed.2d 173 (1960), there is good sense--as well as much precedent--to make this the rarest of possibilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Decisions constantly are being made by judges which, if reassessed in light of later precedent, might have been made differently;  but a final judgment normally ends the quarrel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the common law could not safely develop if the latest evolution in doctrine became the standard for measuring previously resolved claims.  The finality of judgments protects against this kind of retroactive lawmaking.  Admittedly, there is some arbitrariness (e.g., \"new law\" is applied in cases still on direct appeal);  but, by the same token, Jackson itself had not been decided when the Hazens first handed out their employee handbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins says that the abuse of discretion standard under Rule 60(b) should not shield the district court in this case, since that court may have thought itself disabled from reconsidering the panel's holding on the contract award.  But absent extraordinary circumstances, we would think it dubious practice to reopen a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) solely because of later precedent pointing in a different direction.  The fact that a different claim in this case is still alive does not comprise an extraordinary circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hazens' cross-appeal is a challenge to the district court's award of attorney's fees.  To understand the issues requires us to retrace several steps, beginning again with the first trial.  After that trial, the district court in two stages awarded Biggins a total of about $207,000 in fees (plus costs), reflecting Biggins' success on both the ADEA and the ERISA claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attorney's fees are mandatory for the successful plaintiff under the ADEA and permissible under ERISA, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b);  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1140;  as to the latter, the district court exercised its discretion in favor of an award.  No such fees were available for the common-law claims on which Biggins recovered substantial damages, namely, fraud and discharge in violation of contract.  The award for the two federal claims was based upon straight time and upon hourly rates not now in issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first panel opinion, Biggins--having successfully defended his verdicts on both federal claims--sought an additional award of attorney's fees and costs for appellate work.  In March 1992, the panel awarded Biggins additional fees of just under $72,000.  There followed the Supreme Court remand of the ADEA claim and the second panel opinion where Biggins, again successful on that claim, sought further attorney's fees in November 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in June 1994, the en banc court vacated the ADEA award, ordering a new trial.  In a companion order, the panel declined to award any additional fees for the first appeal, as sought by Biggins, and said that the remainder of Biggins' application for additional fees had been rendered moot by the en banc order.  The case then returned to the district court where the new trial occurred in April 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the second trial, Biggins sought to execute judgment on the prior awards of attorney's fees (just over $207,000 for the first trial and almost $72,000 for the first appeal).  The Hazens, by contrast, moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) to reopen the judgment and reduce the previously awarded fees because Biggins was no longer the prevailing party on the ADEA claim.  In July 1996, the district court resolved the matter in a detailed memorandum, pointing out that he was \"intimately familiar\" with the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge agreed with the Hazens that the fee award resulting from the first trial should be reexamined, since one predicate (the ADEA award) had now been undone.  See Mother Goose Nursery Schools, Inc. v. Sendak, 770 F.2d 668, 676 (7th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1102, 106 S.Ct. 884, 88 L.Ed.2d 919 (1986).  But the district judge disagreed with the Hazens that a drastic reduction was warranted.  He concluded that subtracting the ADEA claim from the first trial would not have substantially reduced the amount of time needed to prepare and try the ERISA claim on which Biggins had conclusively prevailed.  He ruled that a 20 percent reduction was warranted and awarded 80 percent of the original $207,000 figure to cover the original trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to alter the panel's award of almost $72,000 for the first appeal;  that appeal, it will be remembered, had resulted in affirmance of the ADEA and ERISA awards, but the ADEA award had later been undone.  The district court said that this court had likely considered the matter of a reduction when it remanded for a new trial, and in any case, that award was the court of appeals' business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court entered a revised judgment covering the entire attorney's fees award in both courts.  The total is about $237,700, apart from costs.  It is from this judgment that the Hazens have now cross-appealed, objecting both to the modesty of the 20 percent reduction in the district court fee and the refusal to reduce at all the amount awarded by this court for appellate work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge's refusal to order more than a 20 percent reduction is easily sustained.  Most of this case has focused throughout on a central event, Biggins' firing, in an effort to appraise the Hazens' reason or reasons;  but motivation had to be discerned through examination of several controversies that had enveloped the parties and led up to the firing, including Biggins' other ventures and claim to stock ownership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial of the firing and related background events would have been quite extensive, and probably pretty similar in contour, even if Biggins had brought only one of the two federal claims.  Indeed, the second trial was nominally limited to the ADEA claim, but its duration and breadth were considerable.  The commonality of issues has already been noted, in the Hazens' favor, sustaining their evidence as to background matters in the second trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the Hazens make no effort to show in detail that the 20 percent reduction understates the time savings from (hypothetically) eliminating the ADEA claim from the first trial.  Instead, they rely mainly upon doctrine, namely, that where</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount .... even where the plaintiff's claims were interrelated....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We say \"mainly\" because the Hazens also try to make use of Biggins' earlier attempt, in resisting a remand, to minimize the importance of the ERISA claim in the first trial.  It is true that Biggins called the claim little more than \"a blip on the screen\" but, of course, the en banc court disagreed with him.  Catching up counsel on past rhetoric is sometimes fair, but not in the present situation where the \"blip\" argument was so clearly unsuccessful exaggeration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us back to Hensley.   Of course, it is sometimes appropriate to discount for failed or non-compensable claims where they cannot be neatly segregated from a successful compensable one.  But the district court did discount by 20 percent for the failed ADEA claim;  and it took the original $207,000 award as already reduced to account for time spent on state claims that would not have been needed for the federal claims.  The former adjustment is obvious;  and if the latter assumption is an error, the Hazens have not shown it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we come to the district court's refusal to reduce the award of almost $72,000 made by this court for the first appeal.  Biggins says that this award is no longer open because the Hazens did not ask for a reduction at the time of the remand;  the Hazens say, we think with some justification, that such a reduction request would have been premature since the possibility remained that Biggins would still prevail on the ADEA claim at the second trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this court is not inclined to reopen its earlier $72,000 award.  In theory, the Hazens have a claim that time spent on the first appeal as to the ADEA issue--among a considerable number of other issues--ought to be subtracted.  But one may doubt, at least here, whether much discernable cost is added by writing more pages in an appellate brief, to address one more issue with which counsel is already familiar after an extensive trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In refusing to reopen the earlier award, we also take into account two other factors:  that the original panel earlier refused to enlarge Biggins' award, despite his offer of further time records, and that this panel has no intention of making a further award to Biggins for time he has just spent in defending his attorney's fee judgment (although it too could be the subject of an award in this court's discretion).  From our standpoint, this case is now over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> ADEA is the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 621, et seq. and ERISA is the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 et seq</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The concern did not come out of the blue.

We hope that this opinion will bring the matter to a close, for a decade of litigation about a single, narrow event is enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case began in February 1988 when Walter Biggins brought suit in district court against his former employer, Hazen Paper Company, and its two principals, Robert Hazen, the president, and his cousin, Thomas Hazen, the treasurer.  The company is a small but successful maker of specialty papers of various kinds.  Biggins joined the company in 1977, at age 52, and served as its technical director for about nine years.  He had no written employment contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his employ, Biggins developed a superior waterbased paper coating that increased the company's sales.  He sought a larger salary, was given a small increase, but remained unsatisfied and sought a further increase.  Biggins later claimed that in 1984 Thomas Hazen had promised him company stock instead of a further raise;  Thomas Hazen denied making any such promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins, during his employ by the company, was also involved in two different ventures with his sons.  When Thomas Hazen learned of this, he sought a confidentiality agreement from Biggins, limiting his outside activities during, and for a limited time after, his employment with the company.  Biggins refused to sign, except in exchange for the stock he said had been promised.  He was discharged in June 1986--a few weeks before his rights under the company pension plan would otherwise have vested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins then sued the company and the Hazen cousins (collectively \"the Hazens\") in an eight-count complaint.  The first two counts charged the Hazens with age discrimination under the ADEA and interference with pension rights under ERISA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The remaining claims, of limited importance to this appeal (except for the contract claim), were for wrongful deprivation of property, wrongful discharge, fraud, conversion, breach of contract and violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H and 11I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, Biggins claimed under the first two counts, respectively, that he had been fired on account of his age--he was replaced with a younger man--and to prevent the vesting of his pension.  In additional counts, he also sought the value of the stock allegedly promised by Thomas Hazen and the benefit of the paper-coating formula and method, which Biggins claimed to own.  The gravamen of the remaining counts was that he had been wrongfully discharged in violation of various rights protected under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its verdict, the jury largely accepted Biggins' position, apart from his claim to ownership of the formula, which it rejected.  On the ADEA claim, the jury awarded him around $560,000;  the ERISA award was $100,000, later adjusted downward to $93,000 on appeal.  The fraud award for the allegedly promised stock was about $315,000.  Biggins was also awarded just under $267,000 for discharge in violation of contract.  On two other counts, only nominal damages were awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury found that the age discrimination was willful, the award on the ADEA count would normally have been doubled, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b), but the district court granted judgment n.o.v. in favor of the Hazens on the issue of willfulness.  In other respects, the district court upheld the jury verdict against various post-trial motions.  We reserve for later discussion the issue of attorney's fees, which the district court also addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, a panel of this court affirmed the district court with several exceptions.  Biggins v. Hazen Paper Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576200\"><a href=\"/opinion/576200/walter-f-biggins-v-the-hazen-paper-company-walter-f-biggins-v-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1405</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992).  Two are pertinent here:  first, the panel found that the evidence on the ADEA count supported damages (before doubling) of only about $420,000, but the panel also reinstated the willfulness finding and doubled the reduced award to about $840,000.  Id. at 1416.   Second, the panel set aside the contract claim verdict for lack of sufficient evidence to establish a contract.  Id. at 1421-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court then granted certiorari and vacated the panel decision on the ADEA count.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span> (1993).  The Court held that the panel had been mistaken in relying upon the ERISA violation to supply the wrongful motive for the ADEA violation;  it said that pensions might often correlate with age but a firing to prevent pension vesting did not itself amount to a firing based upon age.  Id. at 611-13, 113 S.Ct. at 1706-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court remanded the case to the panel to reconsider whether the jury had sufficient evidence to find an ADEA violation once the ERISA violation was put to one side.  507 U.S. at 614, 113 S.Ct. at 1708.   On remand, the original panel reconsidered the ADEA claim.  In a second opinion in October 1993, it ruled that even disregarding the ERISA violation, enough evidence of age discrimination remained to sustain the ADEA verdict, reduced and then doubled as before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hazens then petitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing inter alia that the panel had misconstrued a pertinent Supreme Court decision issued shortly after its remand in this case, St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span> (1993).  After soliciting memoranda, the en banc court in June 1994 ordered a new trial on the ADEA count, concluding that the verdict on this count had been contaminated by the same mistake that had led the Supreme Court to vacate the original panel decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins unsuccessfully sought rehearing and then petitioned the Supreme Court for review, arguing that the en banc court had no power to order a new trial and that the decision to do so violated the Supreme Court's mandate.  The Supreme Court denied certiorari.  In re Biggins, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></span> (1994).  In April 1996, the district court held a new two-week jury trial on the ADEA count.  The jury returned a verdict for the Hazens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After various post-trial motions, Biggins filed the appeal now before us;  a cross-appeal was filed by the Hazens relating only to attorney's fees.  We begin with the attacks by Biggins upon the en banc court's remand for a new trial, and then address his claims of error in the second trial.  Attorney's fees issues, raised by the Hazens' cross-appeal, are considered at the close.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins' challenge to the en banc order requiring a new trial is, strictly speaking, addressed to the wrong bench.  The arguments that the remand was unlawful or unsound were presented to the en banc court in a petition for rehearing, rejected there, and then presented in a petition for certiorari which the Supreme Court denied.  It is not open to the panel, in the normal case, to reconsider issues decided earlier in the same case by the en banc court.  See United States v. DeJesus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446665\"><a href=\"/opinion/446665/united-states-v-edward-dejesus-united-states-of-america-v-veronica/\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 642-43 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, it may be helpful to explain why Biggins' arguments relating to authority of the en banc court are mistaken.  His constitutional argument amounts to this:  first, the Seventh Amendment prohibits any federal court from reexamining jury findings \"otherwise ... than according to the rules of common law\";  and second, in Biggins' view, the en banc court's new trial order overturned the jury findings of age discrimination--without any identified legal error committed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This last qualification is critical.  Where there is legal error, appeals courts often overturn jury verdicts, and order new trials or even dismissal.  This occurs, for example, where evidence has been wrongly admitted, or where an instruction was mistaken, or even where the evidence did not permit a reasonable jury to reach the verdict rendered.  See 9A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2540 (2d ed.1995);  11 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2805 (2d ed.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The en banc court did find prejudicial legal error in the conduct of the original trial.  The court's appraisal, as noted earlier, was that the jury was potentially misled by the same error that the Supreme Court identified in the first panel decision, namely, a belief that the wrongful motive (pension interference) that gave rise to an ERISA violation by itself constituted wrongful motive under ADEA.  Whether or not the en banc court's assessment of prejudice was invincibly supported, the en banc court was free under the Seventh Amendment to make that judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins' other challenge to the en banc court's authority is also wide of the mark.  He argues that when the Supreme Court remanded the case to this court, it precluded this court from taking any action other than an up-or-down vote as to whether enough evidence remained to support the ADEA verdict.  Therefore, says Biggins, the en banc court has violated the Supreme Court's mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a higher court's mandate must be respected, Sprague v. Ticonic Nat'l Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103201\"><a href=\"/opinion/103201/sprague-v-ticonic-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103201\"><a href=\"/opinion/103201/sprague-v-ticonic-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span> (1939), but the issue here is the scope of the mandate.  Where as here a judgment is vacated and the matter remanded, Hazen Paper Co., 507 U.S. at 617, 113 S.Ct. at 1710, the lower court must undo the judgment just vacated and cannot normally revisit a legal issue actually decided by the reviewing court.  But after that, the situation is less rigid than Biggins assumes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, courts are often confronted with issues that were never considered by the remanding court.

Whether this judgment was right or wrong--and we cannot revisit it--the contamination issue had certainly not been addressed in the Supreme Court's opinion.  And when Biggins made his mandate argument for certiorari, the Supreme Court denied the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next claim of error presents the most difficult issue in the case.  Prior to the start of the second trial, motions in limine were filed by both sides.  One such motion, filed by Biggins, invoked collateral estoppel and asked that the Hazens be barred from relitigating issues decided in the first trial on counts other than the ADEA claim.  Specifically, Biggins asked that the Hazens be precluded at trial from showing or arguing (and we quote):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- that the plaintiff was not fired, but left work voluntarily,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- and/or that the plaintiff was fired because he was a disloyal employee,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- and/or that the plaintiff's disloyalty created a need for the defendants to dictate that he sign a restrictive agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a second in limine motion, Biggins asked that the Hazens also be precluded from showing or arguing that Biggins was seeking additional compensation when, in Spring 1986, he conditioned his signing of the confidentiality agreement on being given stock.  Biggins claimed that the first trial had determined that he had been promised the stock in 1984 and that the company had been found liable for fraud in withholding the stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge rejected both in limine motions after an oral hearing, expressing some doubt but concluding that the en banc court had intended a full new trial on the ADEA count.  The judge said (and Biggins readily agreed) that it could make the new trial an empty gesture if the jury were told that Biggins was an innocent victim who had been fired by the Hazens as part of an effort to defraud Biggins.  The court did instruct the jury that Biggins had been fired and had not resigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collateral estoppel, now often called issue preclusion, prevents a party from relitigating at a second trial issues determined between the same parties by an earlier final judgment--subject to various limitations.

But the limitations have been slowly diluted over time and most are irrelevant here.  Nor do the Hazens dispute that the jury verdict in favor of Biggins at the first trial is now final except on the ADEA count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hazens' main argument against collateral estoppel has been that the \"issues\" in the two cases were different because nothing in the first trial validly determined that the Hazens had been motivated by age in firing Biggins (since the Supreme Court had vacated this claim).  This won't wash.  True, age motivation is usually the ultimate issue under the ADEA;  but collateral estoppel is no longer limited to ultimate issues:  necessary intermediate findings can now be used to preclude relitigation.  Grella v. Salem Five Cent Savings Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684074\"><a href=\"/opinion/684074/paul-j-grella-trustee-v-salem-five-cent-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 30-31 (1st Cir.1994);  Restatement (Second), Judgments &#167; 27, comment j.  (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Often it is very difficult to prove that the initial trial necessarily decided an intermediate issue.  But in this case the special verdict form and reasonable inference indicates that several \"facts\" were determined by the jury on counts other than ADEA:  (1) that Biggins was fired, (2) that the stock had been promised to him, and (3) that (in the words of the verdict form) \"defendants wrongfully discharged plaintiff in order to deprive plaintiff of the promised stock compensation....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the new trial, the jury was instructed that Biggins had been fired, so that is out of the case.  But on the second issue Biggins says that the Hazens relitigated the issue of whether they had promised him stock, and that appears to be the case.  A good argument can be made that under standard collateral estoppel doctrine, the Hazens should not have been allowed to relitigate the issue whether \"in fact\" Thomas Hazen had promised the stock to Biggins, a point about which both Biggins and Hazen told largely inconsistent stories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet if there was error, we regard it as harmless.  Whether the stock was promised has little relevance to the question whether the Hazens engaged in age discrimination when they fired Biggins.  Biggins argues that the Hazens purported to fire him because he refused to sign the confidentiality agreement and therefore the stock promise was relevant, Biggins having offered to sign in exchange for the promised stock.  But Biggins' refusal to sign does not vanish as a plausible motive for the Hazens, regardless of whether stock was wrongly withheld.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously the Hazens wanted to relitigate the stock-promise issue, and Biggins to foreclose relitigation, because the Hazens look worse--from the standpoint of character--if they were welshing on a promise and Biggins looks worse if he were making new demands.  But character evidence is not normally admissible to show conformity therewith.  Fed.R.Evid. 404(a).  Thus, the permissible use of the evidence about the promise was very limited so far as the ADEA claim was concerned;  properly used, it added useful context, nothing more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the third \"fact\" in issue, we reject Biggins' claim that the jury should have been told that the Hazens fraudulently discharged Biggins to deprive him of promised stock.  How such an instruction would be understood is unclear:  the Hazens say that (by supplying a different motive) it cuts against Biggins' current claim that he was discharged on account of age;  on the other hand, Biggins would obviously have liked the new jury to hear the terms \"fraud\" and \"wrongful discharge\" as a dual motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem the jury confronted on retrial was to sort out any age discrimination motive in the tangle of other possible motivations, including perceived disloyalty, compensation quarrels, and the like.  We think that it would badly distort matters to tell the jury that in carrying out this task, it must accept that the Hazens' motivation in firing Biggins was wrongful or fraudulent.  The glare from such an instruction would distort any effort to distinguish shadows or shades in the Hazens' actual motivation.  See Fed.R.Evid. 403.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, there was no prejudicial error in this challenged refusal to apply collateral estoppel.  We thus need not decide whether, even on the opposite assumption, it would make any sense to reverse here.  After all, the issues have now been relitigated, collateral estoppel is a doctrine of judicial economy, and one might wonder whether--assuming no other error-such an objective would be served by a third trial.  Cf. Lama v. Borras, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195226\"><a href=\"/opinion/195226/lama-romero-v-asociacion/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 476 n. 5 (1st Cir.1994) (court of appeals will not review denial of summary judgment motion after a full trial and an adverse jury verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the two large claims of error--the attack on the en banc order and the collateral estoppel claim--Biggins makes six shorter claims of trial error and also seeks to resurrect the contract claim found insufficient by the first panel opinion.  Only the contract claim and one of the six claimed trial errors require any discussion;  the other alleged errors are fairly raised but are answered by the Hazens and are of no general interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins' strongest claim of error, which we do address, is that the district court on retrial erred by excluding evidence of his pension status and the Hazens' effort to deprive Biggins of his unvested pension plan benefits upon termination.  Biggins says that without this information, the jury was misled by the Hazens' effort at the second trial to portray the company as a generous employer willing to provide such benefits for Biggins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hazens argue that the attempted pension termination is irrelevant:  they say that Biggins can collect only once for the wrongful termination of his pension, and this loss was compensated by the earlier award on the ERISA count.  But that is beside the point:  facts underlying one claim could be pertinent to a different claim, regardless of whether the former claim had been satisfied.  Still, the Hazens also argue that in this instance the Supreme Court expressly decided that interference with pension vesting is not age discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Actually, the Supreme Court reserved the possibility that pension evidence might occasionally be relevant where the employer is shown consciously to equate pension status with age, Hazen Paper Co., 507 U.S. at 612-13, 113 S.Ct. at 1707-08;  but that is not Biggins' argument here.  Rather, what Biggins wanted the jury to infer from the pension interference finding is that the Hazens are not as nice as they claim to be.  Again, this is largely forbidden character evidence, although the trial court has some latitude since the evidence can also be treated as context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, in regard to age discrimination, the Hazens' generosity vel non is at best marginally relevant.  The district court had every reason to worry, in light of the Supreme Court and en banc decisions, that undue attention to pension termination would prompt yet another reversal.  Even if some narrow path could have been followed--e.g., by limiting instructions--the district court was within its discretion in declining to do so.  See United States v. Houlihan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Following the second trial, Biggins filed a motion to reopen the adverse judgment on the contract claim, relying upon Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), which permits the court to undo a final judgment.  His claim was that a recent state decision undermined the panel's earlier rejection of the contract claim.  The district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand this Rule 60(b) claim, one must return to the original proceedings.  In the first trial, the jury awarded Biggins about $267,000 on his breach of contract claim;  Biggins claimed that the company's \"employee handbook\" comprised a contract under Jackson v. Action for Boston Community Development, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2221330\"><a href=\"/opinion/2221330/jackson-v-action-for-boston-community-development-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2221330\"><a href=\"/opinion/2221330/jackson-v-action-for-boston-community-development-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span> (1988), and that protections it afforded against discharge had been denied to him.  Jackson had held that \"on proper proof, a personnel manual can be shown to form the basis of [such] an express or implied contract.\"  525 N.E.2d at 414.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first appeal, the panel set aside the contract claim award.  The panel noted that there was no evidence that the handbook had been incorporated into a contract by negotiation or that either Biggins or the company had treated the handbook as a contract between them.  953 F.2d at 1423.   The panel held that a judgment n.o.v. should have been granted and vacated the award.  That disposition, like the several jury awards to Biggins that were not further challenged by the Hazens, became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Rule 60(b) motion, Biggins argued that a more recent decision of the state's highest court, O'Brien v. New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></span> (1996), conflicts with the panel's earlier treatment of the contract issue in 1992.  We agree that the panel's disposition of the contract claim might have been different had O'Brien been decided earlier:  its tone and language are more favorable to such recoveries than Jackson.   While there is no direct contradiction, O'Brien is a gradual extension of precedent (Jackson was itself an extension of an earlier case) typical of common-law jurisprudence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the case law is very hostile to using a mistake of state law, still less a change in state common law, as grounds for a motion to reopen a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6).  Although the door is not quite closed, cf.  Polites v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106134\"><a href=\"/opinion/106134/polites-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 433, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106134\"><a href=\"/opinion/106134/polites-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span> (1960), there is good sense--as well as much precedent--to make this the rarest of possibilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Decisions constantly are being made by judges which, if reassessed in light of later precedent, might have been made differently;  but a final judgment normally ends the quarrel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the common law could not safely develop if the latest evolution in doctrine became the standard for measuring previously resolved claims.  The finality of judgments protects against this kind of retroactive lawmaking.  Admittedly, there is some arbitrariness (e.g., \"new law\" is applied in cases still on direct appeal);  but, by the same token, Jackson itself had not been decided when the Hazens first handed out their employee handbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biggins says that the abuse of discretion standard under Rule 60(b) should not shield the district court in this case, since that court may have thought itself disabled from reconsidering the panel's holding on the contract award.  But absent extraordinary circumstances, we would think it dubious practice to reopen a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) solely because of later precedent pointing in a different direction.  The fact that a different claim in this case is still alive does not comprise an extraordinary circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hazens' cross-appeal is a challenge to the district court's award of attorney's fees.  To understand the issues requires us to retrace several steps, beginning again with the first trial.  After that trial, the district court in two stages awarded Biggins a total of about $207,000 in fees (plus costs), reflecting Biggins' success on both the ADEA and the ERISA claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attorney's fees are mandatory for the successful plaintiff under the ADEA and permissible under ERISA, see 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(b);  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1140;  as to the latter, the district court exercised its discretion in favor of an award.  No such fees were available for the common-law claims on which Biggins recovered substantial damages, namely, fraud and discharge in violation of contract.  The award for the two federal claims was based upon straight time and upon hourly rates not now in issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first panel opinion, Biggins--having successfully defended his verdicts on both federal claims--sought an additional award of attorney's fees and costs for appellate work.  In March 1992, the panel awarded Biggins additional fees of just under $72,000.  There followed the Supreme Court remand of the ADEA claim and the second panel opinion where Biggins, again successful on that claim, sought further attorney's fees in November 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in June 1994, the en banc court vacated the ADEA award, ordering a new trial.  In a companion order, the panel declined to award any additional fees for the first appeal, as sought by Biggins, and said that the remainder of Biggins' application for additional fees had been rendered moot by the en banc order.  The case then returned to the district court where the new trial occurred in April 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the second trial, Biggins sought to execute judgment on the prior awards of attorney's fees (just over $207,000 for the first trial and almost $72,000 for the first appeal).  The Hazens, by contrast, moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) to reopen the judgment and reduce the previously awarded fees because Biggins was no longer the prevailing party on the ADEA claim.  In July 1996, the district court resolved the matter in a detailed memorandum, pointing out that he was \"intimately familiar\" with the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge agreed with the Hazens that the fee award resulting from the first trial should be reexamined, since one predicate (the ADEA award) had now been undone.  See Mother Goose Nursery Schools, Inc. v. Sendak, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457108\"><a href=\"/opinion/457108/mother-goose-nursery-schools-inc-an-indiana-not-for-profit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 676 (7th Cir.1985), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></span> (1986).  But the district judge disagreed with the Hazens that a drastic reduction was warranted.  He concluded that subtracting the ADEA claim from the first trial would not have substantially reduced the amount of time needed to prepare and try the ERISA claim on which Biggins had conclusively prevailed.  He ruled that a 20 percent reduction was warranted and awarded 80 percent of the original $207,000 figure to cover the original trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to alter the panel's award of almost $72,000 for the first appeal;  that appeal, it will be remembered, had resulted in affirmance of the ADEA and ERISA awards, but the ADEA award had later been undone.  The district court said that this court had likely considered the matter of a reduction when it remanded for a new trial, and in any case, that award was the court of appeals' business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court entered a revised judgment covering the entire attorney's fees award in both courts.  The total is about $237,700, apart from costs.  It is from this judgment that the Hazens have now cross-appealed, objecting both to the modesty of the 20 percent reduction in the district court fee and the refusal to reduce at all the amount awarded by this court for appellate work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge's refusal to order more than a 20 percent reduction is easily sustained.  Most of this case has focused throughout on a central event, Biggins' firing, in an effort to appraise the Hazens' reason or reasons;  but motivation had to be discerned through examination of several controversies that had enveloped the parties and led up to the firing, including Biggins' other ventures and claim to stock ownership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial of the firing and related background events would have been quite extensive, and probably pretty similar in contour, even if Biggins had brought only one of the two federal claims.  Indeed, the second trial was nominally limited to the ADEA claim, but its duration and breadth were considerable.  The commonality of issues has already been noted, in the Hazens' favor, sustaining their evidence as to background matters in the second trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the Hazens make no effort to show in detail that the 20 percent reduction understates the time savings from (hypothetically) eliminating the ADEA claim from the first trial.  Instead, they rely mainly upon doctrine, namely, that where</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount .... even where the plaintiff's claims were interrelated....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hensley v.

It is true that Biggins called the claim little more than \"a blip on the screen\" but, of course, the en banc court disagreed with him.  Catching up counsel on past rhetoric is sometimes fair, but not in the present situation where the \"blip\" argument was so clearly unsuccessful exaggeration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us back to Hensley.   Of course, it is sometimes appropriate to discount for failed or non-compensable claims where they cannot be neatly segregated from a successful compensable one.  But the district court did discount by 20 percent for the failed ADEA claim;  and it took the original $207,000 award as already reduced to account for time spent on state claims that would not have been needed for the federal claims.  The former adjustment is obvious;  and if the latter assumption is an error, the Hazens have not shown it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we come to the district court's refusal to reduce the award of almost $72,000 made by this court for the first appeal.  Biggins says that this award is no longer open because the Hazens did not ask for a reduction at the time of the remand;  the Hazens say, we think with some justification, that such a reduction request would have been premature since the possibility remained that Biggins would still prevail on the ADEA claim at the second trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this court is not inclined to reopen its earlier $72,000 award.  In theory, the Hazens have a claim that time spent on the first appeal as to the ADEA issue--among a considerable number of other issues--ought to be subtracted.
