Ct. No. RCR 22225\n ___________________________________ )\n\n\n        In a bench trial before the Superior Court of San Bernardino County, defendant\nJohn Lee Cunningham was convicted of the first degree murders of Wayne Sonke, David\nSmith, and Jose Silva. (Pen. Code, §§ 187, subd. (a), 189.1) The trial court found true\nthe special circumstance allegations that defendant committed multiple murders and that\nthe murders of Sonke and Smith took place during the commission of a burglary and a\nrobbery. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3), (17)(A) and 17(G).) The court also found defendant\nguilty of one count of second degree burglary (§ 459), three counts of second degree\nrobbery (§ 211), one count of arson (§ 451, subd. (d)), and one count of possession of a\nfirearm by a felon (former § 12021, subd. (a)). The court further found true various\nsentencing enhancement allegations—that defendant personally used a firearm in the\ncommission of the murders, robberies, and burglary (former § 12022.5, subd. (a)), had\npreviously been convicted of various felonies (§ 667), and had served prior prison terms\nfor felony convictions (§ 667.5).\n\n1       All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise noted.\n\f       A jury was sworn for the penalty phase and returned a verdict of death. After\nconducting an automatic review and declining defendant‘s request to modify the jury‘s\nverdict (§ 190.4, subd. (e)), the trial court sentenced him to death for the three first degree\nmurders with special circumstances, as well as to a determinate term of 16 years for the\nremaining counts and allegations.\n       This appeal is automatic. (§ 1239, subd. (b).) We affirm the judgment in its\nentirety.\n                                         I. FACTS\n\n       A. The Guilt Phase\n       Defendant went to Surplus Office Sales (SOS) in Ontario, California, around\nclosing time on the afternoon of Saturday, June 27, 1992, and robbed the three remaining\nemployees at gunpoint. He then bound the victims, herded them into a bathroom, and\nshot them each at least once in the head. Afterward, he set fire to the building before\nfleeing the scene. He was arrested a month later while on the run from police. Defendant\nsubsequently confessed to the murders, burglary, and robberies, and participated in a\nvideotaped reenactment of the crimes.\n       Waiving his right to a jury, defendant‘s bench trial extended over 10 non-\ncontiguous court days. In addition to the prosecution‘s guilt phase evidence, the trial\ncourt considered the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing and at pretrial\nproceedings concerning defendant‘s motion to suppress his multiple confessions.\n\n            1. The prosecution’s case\n\n               a) The crimes\n       Around 4:00 p.m. on June 27, 1992, members of the Ontario Fire Department\nresponding to a call at SOS found an inactive fire in the office portion of the building and\nthree homicide victims in a hallway bathroom. An autopsy revealed that SOS employee\nJose Silva died from two gunshot wounds to the head, assistant manager David Smith\n\n                                              2\n\fdied from multiple gunshot wounds to the head and neck, and store manager Wayne\nSonke died from a single gunshot wound to the head. More than $1,000 in cash had been\ntaken from the store‘s cash register and petty cash box.\n       Michael Ray, the owner of SOS, had employed defendant in the early and mid-\n1980s at two other businesses. About a month before the murders, Ray returned a phone\ncall from defendant asking about work. Ray had not heard from him for three or four\nyears. Defendant also made unannounced visits to SOS on June 20 and 24, a week and a\nfew days before the murders respectively.\n       About 8:30 p.m. on the evening of the murders, defendant called SOS employee\nEvelyn Eriksen at home to ask how she was. Defendant told her he had been playing\npoker with some friends since about noon that day. Later, defendant took Alana Costello,\nhis girlfriend at the time, to the movies and a motel room. Costello was surprised\nbecause defendant was not steadily employed and had been under ―stress‖ trying to find\nenough money for them to move into a bigger apartment. That evening, defendant was\n―much more close-mouthed‖ than usual and acting ―very stressed, very tense, very\nwrapped up in himself.‖ According to Costello, defendant generally was distant and\nremoved, had difficulty sleeping, and would wake up in the middle of the night from bad\ndreams. He had borrowed her Ruger .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle and modified it by\nsawing off part of the stock and barrel. A few days after the murders, Costello noticed\nthe rifle was missing.\n\n              b) Defendant’s subsequent flight and capture\n       On June 30, defendant called Diana Jamison, a former girlfriend. Jamison told\ndefendant that his parole officer had come to her house looking for him. In a later\ntelephone conversation, defendant told Jamison he was on the run because someone,\nperhaps the Mexican Mafia, was after him. Around the same time, defendant called\nJamison upset and crying, saying ―something very terrible had happened‖ and he wanted\n\n\n                                             3\n\fto come back and ―do the right thing.‖ Jamison told defendant to turn himself in.\nAccording to Jamison, defendant had trouble sleeping; he would often wake up in the\nmiddle of the night in a cold sweat, and mentioned dreams of being tortured by women\nand children from his time in Vietnam. Defendant had tried to seek counseling at a\nveteran‘s center.\n       On July 1, Costello received a telephone call from defendant asking her to join\nhim in Nevada. Meeting up at the Las Vegas airport, the two traveled by car to Atlantic\nCity, New Jersey, then drove southwest through Arkansas before heading north. Along\nthe way, defendant placed an Ohio license plate on the car and registered under false\nnames at motels. He never discussed why he had left California and when Costello\nasked, he did not want to talk about it. After seeing how anxious defendant became when\npolice cars passed them, she concluded that he was running from the law.\n       On July 23, law enforcement officers stopped defendant‘s car in Deadwood, South\nDakota after being advised he was in the region and wanted as a murder suspect.\nDefendant and Costello were both taken into custody and defendant was arrested for\nviolating his parole. Police seized a Ruger .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle, a box\ncontaining 31 cartridges for a .22-caliber long rifle, and a magazine loaded with 10\nrounds of .22-caliber ammunition.\n\n              c) Defendant’s statements to law enforcement officers and videotaped\n                 reenactment of the crimes\n       Over the following two days, Ontario Police Department Detectives Gregory\nNottingham and Pat Ortiz interrogated defendant four times. Each interrogation was\naudiotaped or videotaped. On each occasion, the recording equipment was in plain view.\n       At their first meeting the morning of July 24, after approximately six minutes of\npreliminary introductions and questions, Detective Nottingham read defendant his rights\npursuant to Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S. 436 (Miranda). After defendant\nconfirmed that he understood these rights, Nottingham proceeded to ask defendant about\n\n                                             4\n\fhis relationships with Costello and Jamison, as well as about his military and employment\nbackground and his prior robbery arrest. In discussing these subjects, defendant\nrecounted working for Michael Ray at a facility in Long Beach in 1979 and going to SOS\nin Ontario in early June 1992 to visit Eriksen and to look for a job.\n       Defendant then volunteered, ―I know what you guys are getting at. . . . I also want\nyou to know that the reason why I‘m so calm is because I‘m where I belong. . . . I know\nwhy you‘re here in my dreams and that‘s all.‖ When asked to clarify, defendant replied,\n―You know as well as I do that I committed an armed robbery in Ontario‖ at ―Mike‘s\ncompany.‖ When asked for further clarification, defendant reiterated, ―I committed an\narmed robbery,‖ and asked, ―Should I have somebody here talking for me, is this the way\nit‘s supposed to be done?‖ Detective Nottingham reread defendant his Miranda rights\nand asked if he understood them. Defendant stated, ―I do understand.‖\n       In response to the detectives‘ subsequent questions, defendant gave an\noccasionally rambling account of his activities on June 27, describing how he chose to\nrob SOS, how the robbery, murders, and arson occurred, and his subsequent actions. He\nadmitted entering SOS with the intention to steal money, binding the hands of the three\nvictims with duct tape, returning to the bathroom to shoot them, and then using gasoline\nto set the building on fire. These confessions were interspersed with references to\ndefendant‘s dreams, things he claimed to have done during his military service in\nVietnam, and expressions of relief at being caught.\n       The detectives interrogated defendant two more times the afternoon of July 24,\nand again the following morning. No additional Miranda advisements were given.\nDefendant told the detectives he had altered two military personnel forms found in his car\nbecause he was looking for work and wanted to ―look[] better‖ and ―cover‖ for time\nwhen he had been incarcerated. He also indicated he had ―ripped off a shipment‖ as a\nnarcotics courier and asked at one point to be placed in protective custody. One of the\n\n\n                                             5\n\fdetectives also made references to the victims‘ families, stating that once lawyers got\ninvolved in a case, it would get ―a lot more complicated.‖\n       Between July 27 and July 31, the detectives spoke with prosecutors working on\nthe case and played the interview tapes for them. Because the quality of the tapes was\npoor, the prosecutors suggested a videotaped reenactment at the crime scene and told the\ndetectives that the reenactment should be done before an arrest warrant was filed. On\nJuly 31, Wesley Lewis, a correctional sergeant at Folsom Prison where defendant was\nbeing held on his parole violation, interviewed defendant to determine whether he would\nbe willing to participate in the reenactment. Defendant indicated that he would be\n―happy‖ to cooperate ―if it would get me out of here any sooner or quicker.‖\n       On August 2, defendant conducted a reenactment of the crimes, which two\ndetectives observed and videotaped. Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights before\nstarting the reenactment, and affirmed that he understood these rights and wished to talk\nto law enforcement officers.\n       In the video, defendant described how on the day of the murders he first went to\nSOS shortly after noon and stayed for about a half-hour talking with the three victims.\nHe then left and returned after 3:00 p.m. ―to take all the money . . . so I could leave the\nstate.‖ He reentered SOS with the shortened .22-caliber rifle concealed in a paper bag.\nAt gunpoint, defendant ordered the three victims to follow him through the hallway to the\nfront lobby, where he forced Sonke to give him the money from the cash register.\n       When defendant asked Sonke where the rest of the money was, Sonke indicated it\nwas in an office down the hall. Defendant made all the victims go with him to that\nlocation and Sonke opened a filing cabinet with some keys, but did not remove anything.\nDefendant took the keys and made the victims enter the women‘s bathroom, where he\ntold them to lie down on the floor and be quiet. He left all three victims with their hands\nbound behind them with heavy duty tape he had purchased weeks before, but also\nclaimed he had only planned the robbery earlier that day when he decided to return to\n                                              6\n\fSOS. Defendant then took the money from the cash drawer in the filing cabinet, returned\nto the bathroom, and shot the three men.\n       Retrieving a can of gasoline from his car, defendant went back inside to set fire to\nthe building. When he reentered the bathroom, Silva and Sonke were not moving but\nSmith was attempting to break loose of his bonds. Defendant shot Smith again, poured\ngasoline along the hallway, and ignited it with a match. He then removed a key from\ninside the front door and exited, locking the door from the outside. He drove to a\nfreeway overpass to watch the building for a minute or so until a fire truck arrived.\n\n          2. The defense case\n       In his opening argument during the guilt phase, defense counsel described\ndefendant‘s experiences in Vietnam, stating that because of posttraumatic stress disorder,\nthere were periods in his life when defendant ―lost time.‖ With respect to the murders,\ncounsel claimed these were not crimes defendant wanted to commit, and that the only\nway law enforcement officers were able to connect defendant to them was by virtue of\ndefendant‘s cooperation. Counsel cross-examined prosecution witnesses, but presented\nno guilt phase witnesses or other evidence on defendant‘s behalf.\n       During closing argument, counsel contended defendant committed the charged\noffenses because he was experiencing a buildup of pressure caused by a mix of\nhelplessness and fear. In conclusion, counsel argued, ―from everything we know John\nCunningham wished to take responsibility for this particular crime, and he did.‖\n\n       B. The Penalty Phase\n       Defendant‘s requests to absent himself from the penalty phase were denied. A\njury was selected and heard evidence for 34 court days over the course of five months.\nThe prosecution presented testimony relating to the circumstances surrounding the\ncrimes, the effect of the murders on those connected to the victims, and defendant‘s prior\nfelony convictions. Defendant presented extensive testimony to document his abusive\n\n\n                                             7\n\fchildhood, his traumatic combat experiences in Vietnam, and the effects of posttraumatic\nstress disorder on Vietnam-era veterans. He also presented testimony that attempted to\ndiscredit some of the prior crimes evidence.\n\n          1. The prosecution’s case in aggravation\n\n              a) The circumstances surrounding the murders\n       The prosecution presented the testimony of many of the same witnesses who\ntestified during the preliminary hearing and the bench trial to demonstrate the\ncircumstances surrounding the burglary, robberies, murders, and arson. Also presented\nwere the videotapes and transcripts of defendant‘s July 1992 interviews and August 1992\nreenactment and stipulations regarding the collection of crime scene evidence.\n\n              b) Prior crimes\n       On April 24, 1976, Herta Gill was a cashier at the Vineland Drive-In in the City of\nIndustry, California, when at about 9:00 p.m., defendant robbed her at gunpoint of all the\nmoney in her register. He was apprehended a short time later while in possession of a\nfirearm and the stolen cash. After pleading guilty to felony robbery and admitting to\npersonally using a handgun, defendant was sentenced to one year in county jail and then\nplaced on probation.\n       On April 5, 1982, Michelle I. was 14 years old and alone at her home in La\nMirada, California, when defendant sexually assaulted her. Defendant, then a family\nfriend, entered the home on the pretense his car had broken down, but after appearing to\nuse the phone asked Michelle to give him a ―blow job.‖ When she refused, defendant\nforced her onto her knees. When she began screaming, defendant struck her in the face\nwith a closed fist, threatened further physical violence if she continued to scream, and\ndragged her by the hair to the sofa, where he forced her to perform oral sex on him for\napproximately 10 minutes. Before leaving, defendant said he had killed his ex-wife and\nher lover and warned he would ―come back‖ to do the same to Michelle if she told\n\n                                               8\n\fanyone what had happened. Michelle nonetheless reported the incident to her family and\nthe police and testified at the subsequent trial. Defendant was convicted of felony\nforcible oral copulation with a minor and sentenced to state prison.\n       In April 1987, Samira S. was 15 years old and living with her mother and younger\nsister in Paramount, California, when defendant, a family friend, moved in. Within two\nor three weeks, he began fondling and kissing Samira when they were alone. She would\ntell him to stop, but defendant would continue touching different parts of her body.\nSubsequently, defendant forced Samira to perform oral sex on him, slapping her when\nshe did not perform to his satisfaction. Samira thereafter engaged in oral sex with\ndefendant once or twice a week between April and September of 1987. If she resisted,\ndefendant would get angry and slap her. Defendant repeatedly tried to convince Samira\nto have sexual intercourse with him but she refused. Nevertheless, he would put Vaseline\nor baby oil on his penis and partially penetrate her vagina. Defendant also asked to take\nnaked photographs of Samira, but she refused. Sometimes defendant would give Samira\nmoney and buy her gifts. He also caused her to be truant from her summer school\ncourses. In September or October of 1987, Samira told a friend from church and a school\ncounselor about defendant‘s sexual assaults. He was convicted of two counts of oral\ncopulation with a minor and sentenced to state prison.\n\n              c) Victim impact evidence\n       The prosecution introduced the testimony of family members of the victims who\ntestified about qualities of their loved one and how each learned about the murders. Jose\nSilva was the youngest of 10 children and was raised by his older sister Josefina after\ntheir mother died. He regularly attended family functions and had a one-year-old son at\nthe time of his death. David Smith had been married to his wife Mimi for 10 years when\nhe died and had a daughter named Tiffany. His half brother described Smith as someone\nwho loved the outdoors and as ―a very gentle soul.‖ Wayne Sonke had five adult\n\n\n                                             9\n\fchildren and five grandchildren at the time of his death. His daughter Lois Backe\ndescribed being at her mother‘s house waiting for Sonke to return home from work when\nthe fire department called asking for Sonke and saying that the alarms had gone off at\nSOS. After her father still had not returned or called home, Backe drove to SOS. A\npolice officer on the scene told her there had been a triple homicide and asked Backe to\ndescribe her father. She later had to give the news of his murder to her youngest brother\nand mother.\n\n          2. The defense’s case in mitigation\n\n              a) Family and social history\n       Ronald Forbush, a defense investigator, researched defendant‘s personal and\nsocial history and interviewed various relatives. Defendant‘s parents Vivian and Maurice\nCunningham divorced when defendant was approximately two years old. Vivian had a\nprior marriage at age 14, two subsequent marriages, and apparently worked at some point\nas a prostitute. Maurice subsequently remarried as well. As a result, defendant had two\nolder brothers, Sam and W.C., and several half siblings and stepbrothers and stepsisters.\nAt the time of the trial, defendant‘s parents were deceased, and his brother Sam was in\nHuntsville State Prison in Texas.\n       Vivian‘s younger half sister Carolyn M. testified that Vivian was dishonest; at\nvarious times she had lied about a brother having died, about being in a car accident, and\nabout her middle son (W.C.) having died. Carolyn also recounted one evening when she\nwas in seventh grade and Vivian and Maurice were living in the same house as the rest of\nthe family when Carolyn awoke to find Maurice sexually molesting her.\n       Defendant‘s brother W.C. testified their mother and father both had problems with\nalcohol. One time, when W.C. was under 10 years old, Vivian, intoxicated, called him\ninto her bedroom and sexually fondled him. After he left, she called the other two\nbrothers into the room one by one. Vivian‘s sexual abuse may have been recurring.\n\n\n                                             10\n\fMaurice and Gene Collins, a stepfather, physically abused the boys. One time, after a\nviolent confrontation with Collins in which Vivian stabbed him with a fork, she\nabandoned her three sons (then ages five, seven, and nine) for several weeks and they\nwere forced to steal food to survive. Eventually, the boys were placed in an orphanage\nfor approximately a year. Later they were flown to California to live with Maurice, his\nsecond wife Betty, and her children from a previous marriage. W.C. believed that his\nfather sexually abused his stepsister, although Maurice never molested W.C. or, to the\nbest of W.C.‘s knowledge, defendant or their brother Sam.\n       One of defendant‘s stepbrothers testified that Maurice was a heavy drinker who\noften became violent with Betty and the children. Maurice also sexually molested the\nstepbrother so often he ―couldn‘t count the times.‖ Once when he was in seventh grade,\nthe stepbrother told his mother Betty about the molestation. She cried but never did\nanything to stop it.\n       Diana Jamison, one of defendant‘s former girlfriends, testified she got the\nimpression from defendant that his mother, Vivian, was very promiscuous when he was a\nyoung boy and had many different men coming in and out of her life. Defendant also\nalluded to having been sexually molested by his father, but would not discuss any details\nwith Jamison.\n       Some of the sexual abuse detailed by the above witnesses was confirmed or\nalluded to by defendant in his interviews with Thomas Williams, one of the defense‘s\npenalty phase psychologists.\n\n              b) Military background\n       After defendant graduated from high school, he enlisted in the United States\nArmy. According to relevant military files and records, defendant was court-martialed\nvarious times for being absent without leave (AWOL) between May 1969 and March\n1970. In May 1970, defendant was sent to Vietnam for approximately 11 months where\n\n\n                                            11\n\fhe was promoted three times, ultimately to sergeant. As a result of his service in the\nVietnam War, defendant received several commendations.\n       While in Vietnam, defendant engaged in reconnaissance missions with units that\nwould travel through the jungles for periods of five to 14 days scouting and securing\nareas believed to be infiltrated by the Viet Cong or North Vietnamese Army. The units\nset up claymore mines for mechanical ambushes and engaged in several firefights in\nwhich enemy troops or sympathizers were killed or captured. Defendant at one time\noperated in a ―free fire zone,‖ meaning that the soldiers had permission to kill any enemy\ncombatants in that area. Sometimes a unit would happen upon empty enemy bunkers or\nmass enemy graves; other times it found ―blood trails‖ left by the enemy dragging their\nwounded or dead soldiers away from combat scenes. If a unit encountered an enemy\nvillage in an uncontrolled area not authorized for settlement, standard operating\nprocedure was to evacuate the people and set the buildings on fire. Once, defendant\nrequired medical attention due to heat exhaustion. Another time, he was hospitalized for\na malaria infection.\n       Nineteen veterans who served in defendant‘s reconnaissance platoons testified\nabout their daily activities and various missions in Vietnam. Some of the veterans who\ntestified characterized defendant as a ―good soldier‖ but also as a ―loner‖ who generally\nkept to himself. Others did not specifically remember defendant. Three veterans,\nincluding one who allegedly knew defendant the best, for various reasons were unable to\nattend the trial and testify.\n       Many of the veterans who testified suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD), flashbacks, depression, or other problems as a result of their service in Vietnam.\nThese veterans explained they often had problems adjusting to life after Vietnam, and\nmany of those adjustment problems remained with them throughout their lives. They had\ntrouble sleeping, were regularly afflicted by nightmares, and experienced problems with\nanxiety, hypervigilance, and being easily startled by innocuous sounds (such as a car\n                                            12\n\fbackfire or a motorcycle) or simple sights (like a tree stump). One witness compared the\nexperience of suffering from PTSD to ―carrying a demon around at times.‖ However,\nnone had committed any felonies or crimes of violence after they returned home.\n       Cross-examination further revealed that other than the death of a medic from a\nmortar accident on base, there were no casualties or fatalities in any of defendant‘s\nplatoons. Defendant was never captured or tortured by the enemy, and none of his units\never destroyed a village in a manner that killed women and children. Defendant did not\nparticipate in long-range reconnaissance patrols or Special Forces. Although the\nreconnaissance platoons rarely took prisoners, on one occasion, defendant‘s unit took 30\nto 50 prisoners, including women and children who were sympathetic to the enemy, but\nnone of the prisoners were bound or mistreated in any way.\n       After Vietnam, defendant was stationed for the remainder of his three-year tour at\nFort Hood, Texas, where he was court-martialed four different times for being AWOL.\nUltimately, he was demoted from his sergeant rank and honorably discharged as a\nprivate.\n\n              c) Psychological evidence concerning posttraumatic stress disorder\n       G. Robert Baker and Thomas Williams testified for the defense as experts on\nPTSD, among other topics. Baker was a psychologist with the Department of Veterans\nAffairs and clinical coordinator for the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder. Williams was a psychologist who specialized in working with trauma victims\nand training individuals involved in treating veterans. Both served in Vietnam in the\nMarines Corps.\n       Baker and Williams described PTSD as a reaction to unusual and frightful events\noutside the normal range of human experiences, such as those experienced in war zones.\nThe symptoms of PTSD include nightmares, intrusive and unwanted thoughts and\nimages, flashbacks, avoidance and dissociative behaviors, depression, psychiatric\n\n\n                                            13\n\fnumbing, social isolation, disassociation from and distrust of others, anxiety, sleep\ndisorders, anger management problems, hypervigilance, adrenalin- or sensation-seeking\nbehaviors, memory impairment, and concentration difficulties. Although there is no cure\nfor PTSD, the symptoms can be treated and individuals can be taught how to manage\nthem.\n        Williams explained symptoms such as flashbacks or nightmares could happen at\nany time depending on the particular individual and his experiences. However, certain\nstimuli would be expected to trigger them. Military training in particular sensitized\nsoldiers to various stimuli and caused them to react quickly to perceived danger. PTSD\nmay also be retriggered by secondary traumatic experiences, or compounded by\npreceding ones. According to Baker, although soldiers suffering from PTSD might be\nexpected to avoid events such as fireworks displays, which can trigger combat memories,\nthey might still carry guns, which would likewise trigger combat memories, because guns\nwere a source of protection. Recurrence of malaria symptoms also can act as a PTSD\ntrigger, although malaria infections themselves, which were common in Vietnam, did not\ncause PTSD. Baker also explained the concept of ―survivor guilt‖ and how soldiers who\nsuffered from PTSD often exaggerated their combat roles.\n        Both experts explained how the Vietnam conflict presented unique difficulties for\nmany reasons—most of the soldiers were very young, the war had no front lines, there\nwere no clearly defined objectives other than killing people, it was often unclear who was\nthe enemy, there were no safe areas in light of the guerrilla nature of the war, there was\nno winning strategy, the primary goal was survival, there was little unit cohesion because\nsoldiers were constantly being replaced, the jungle environment made living conditions\ndifficult, and neither the Vietnamese civilian population nor the American public\nappreciated the soldiers. These factors made it more difficult to treat Vietnam War\nveterans suffering from PTSD. In particular, the social isolation Vietnam veterans felt\nupon returning home prevented them from seeking treatment. In defendant‘s case, the\n                                             14\n\fisolation was exacerbated because he did not have a loving and supportive family or\nreligion to turn to upon his return. Present-day treatments for PTSD, moreover, were not\navailable to veterans in the early 1970s, as the disorder was not well understood at that\ntime.\n        Based on his review of defendant‘s records, Baker opined defendant was involved\nin the type of combat that could produce PTSD. However, he never met or evaluated\ndefendant for PTSD. Baker explained how individuals are screened for PTSD and the\nimportance of confirming the truthfulness of reported personal histories in rendering a\ndiagnosis, as malingering—feigning the symptoms of a disorder—can apply to someone\nclaiming to suffer from PTSD.\n        Williams positively diagnosed defendant as having PTSD. This diagnosis was\nbased on his interviews of defendant for three days in May and June of 1995, and his\nreview of the videotapes of defendant‘s interviews with the detectives and the\nreenactment, charts of the daily activities of defendant‘s Vietnam units, statements of\nfamily members and the veterans who served with defendant, and the penalty phase\ntestimony of various witnesses. Williams did not, however, meet with any of the\nwitnesses from the case.\n        In his interviews with Williams, defendant said when his mother abandoned him\nand his brothers, their electricity and water were turned off and they had to steal food to\neat and use neighbors‘ swimming pools to bathe. Defendant further claimed he broke\ninto other people‘s homes to observe what normal childhood and family life was like. He\ntold Williams that he was isolated in the orphanage. He alluded to being sexually\nmolested by his mother once, and told Williams that he was once sexually fondled by his\nfather, had personally observed his father having sex with his half sister at least once, and\n―quite frequently‖ heard his stepbrother screaming as Maurice sodomized him. Although\ndefendant refused to give details of the alleged molestation by his mother, saying ―he was\ngoing to take that to his grave,‖ Williams felt the brother‘s reported sexual abuse by\n                                             15\n\fVivian and the literature on sexual abuse—which stated generally all the children are\nsexually abused within a family that has sexual abuse—corroborated defendant‘s claim of\nabuse by his mother. Williams further noted that observing sexual abuse could cause\nPTSD.\n        Williams opined defendant‘s PTSD was caused by childhood neglect and sexual\nabuse, as well as combat experiences in Vietnam. Defendant most likely developed\nPTSD when he was about nine years old, and then was retraumatized in Vietnam, which\ncontributed to his then-current PTSD. Although he believed defendant had PTSD when\nhe robbed Gill and committed the sexual offenses against Michelle I. and Samira S.,\nWilliams could not say whether defendant was going through a dissociative episode when\nhe committed those offenses. Williams conceded child molestation, robbery, and murder\nwere not part of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Although Williams found defendant to\nhave an ―[i]nability to delay sexual gratification and generally poor sexual adjustment,‖\nhe did not consider defendant a pedophile or sex addict.\n        Defendant told Williams he had always had an active ―fantasy life,‖ had difficulty\nat times distinguishing fantasy from reality, and relied on dreams for memory. When\nrelating stories about Vietnam, defendant was not sure whether they really happened or\nnot. Williams believed this was dissociative behavior indicative of PTSD. It was clear to\nWilliams defendant‘s Vietnam service was very important to him, ―a cornerstone in his\nlife.‖ Williams acknowledged defendant made inaccurate or untrue claims about his\nmilitary background and Vietnam experiences during the police interviews. He also was\naware defendant had altered a form regarding his military experience, listing training and\nawards he did not receive and operations in which he did not participate, and deleting\nreferences to his AWOLs. Williams agreed falsification of military records might\nindicate a ―factitious‖ PTSD disorder or malingering, and it was also possible defendant‘s\nfalse Vietnam stories were unrelated to PTSD and only ―embellishments of war stories.‖\n\n\n                                            16\n\f       Based on his review of autopsy photographs and defendant‘s statements to law\nenforcement officers, Williams opined defendant ―dissociated‖ at some point during the\nSOS killings. As a result of this altered state of mind, although defendant knew robbery\nwas wrong at the time, he did not ―really internally believe[]‖ he had committed the\nmurders until he participated in the reenactment. In support of this conclusion, Williams\ncited defendant‘s claim he felt like he was standing behind himself watching the crimes\nhappen, his shooting the victims even though they were bound with tape and he already\nhad the money, his viewing Smith as a threat when Smith broke his bonds, defendant‘s\nreference to ―the LT‖ or lieutenant instructing soldiers ―to always burn the village, never\nleave anyone behind, kill everyone,‖ and the physical distress defendant manifested in the\nvideo reenactment of the crime. Although defendant did not refer to his dreams during\nthe reenactment as he had done in the first interview, Williams still felt defendant was\n―drifting‖ during the reenactment. Williams also related some of defendant‘s behaviors\nto experiences defendant had had in Vietnam, such as arming himself with a gun, using\nduct tape, and shooting the victims in the head even if they might already have been dead.\nHe conceded, however, a person who intentionally makes a decision to injure another or\nrob someone in order to take money would ―probably‖ not be acting due to PTSD.\n       Defendant also took a self-administered and unsupervised test called the\nDissociation Experiences Scale (DES). Based on the DES, Williams concluded\ndefendant had a high level of dissociative experiences. Another self-administered and\nunsupervised test, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI-2),\nindicated defendant was distrustful and moody, had poor social skills, and was not\nmalingering. Two subscales within the MMPI-2 scored defendant positive for PTSD.\nHowever, defendant declined to answer five questions out of 568, which prompted the\ntesting service to state ―the pattern of his item omission should be carefully noted.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f              d) Prior crimes\n       Daniel and Olivia Negron knew Samira S. and her mother through church. While\ndefendant was residing in Samira‘s home, the Negrons attended social functions during\nwhich Samira sat on defendant‘s lap and appeared to be ―very flirtatious with‖ and\n―coming on‖ to him in an inappropriate manner.\n       Damarie H., Samira‘s aunt, stayed at Samira‘s home for approximately six\nmonths, during which time defendant was sleeping on the sofa. Damarie noticed Samira\ndid not shy away from the attention she received from defendant. Concerned about their\nrelationship, she asked Samira if ―anything was going on‖ with defendant. Samira\nbecame defensive, saying her mother was ―starting to get on her case about the same\nthing.‖ Samira told her aunt defendant was ―very nice‖ and she cared for him, and tried\nto imply there was something going on between defendant and her mother. According to\nDamarie, Samira was not always truthful. Although Samira bruised easily as a result of\nhaving lupus, Damarie did not recall seeing any bruises on her during the time defendant\nwas staying with them.\n       Deputy Sheriff Pierre Nadeau interviewed Samira in October 1987. When asked\nabout bruising around her eyes and swelling on the back of her head, Samira told Nadeau\nshe had been injured fighting with her mother. When Deputy Sheriff Goran interviewed\nSamira, she never mentioned defendant had slapped her, but said she was afraid to say no\nto defendant because other men had previously slapped or beat her for refusing sex.\nWhen Dr. Kerry English examined Samira, she also did not tell him that defendant had\nslapped her. Although she indicated defendant had twice attempted to have sexual\nintercourse with her, she stated defendant stopped because it was painful for her.\n\n          3. The prosecution’s rebuttal in aggravation\n       Detective Nottingham testified defendant told him during the Deadwood, South\nDakota, interview that he had spent two years in Vietnam and served in the Special\n\n\n                                            18\n\fForces. Nottingham further explained how he found the original and altered forms\nrelating to defendant‘s military record.\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n          1. Pretrial shackling\n       Defendant claims he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due\nprocess and a fair trial when he was ―repeatedly and unnecessarily‖ restrained during\npretrial proceedings without an adequate showing of manifest need and without\nemploying less restrictive alternatives. He argues the shackling rendered his trial\nstructurally unsound and resulted in prejudice. This claim is meritless.\n\n              a) Background\n       During the initial hearing on defendant‘s motion to suppress his statements to law\nenforcement officers, defense counsel objected to defendant‘s being shackled in the\ncourtroom. The trial court ordered defendant‘s waist chains removed and his hands\nplaced in regular handcuffs in front of his body. After counsel continued to object to the\nhandcuffs, the prosecutor placed on the record various reasons justifying the shackling,\nincluding that defendant was being tried for three capital murders and had specialized\nmilitary training. The court ultimately ruled the ―limited restraints‖ would remain for\npurposes of the current proceedings.\n       At the next hearing, defense counsel objected to any shackling of defendant,\nindicating defendant would ―waive all appearances if he has to go through this shackling\nbusiness.‖ The court stated it was willing to order defendant not be restrained in the\ncourtroom and to be restrained only during transit in the public halls of the courthouse, a\nroutine security measure in the San Bernardino courthouse not limited to defendant. The\nprosecutor concurred and the court ordered defendant ―not be shackled in the courtroom.‖\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f       Defendant subsequently filed a motion objecting to the use of restraints in the\nholding areas of the courthouse, where he might be kept for several hours before a court\nappearance, and further requesting the case be transferred back to the Rancho\nCucamonga courthouse, where the preliminary hearing had been held and where in-\ntransit shackling apparently was not required. The trial court ultimately ordered that\ndefendant not be restrained in the holding facilities or the courtroom. However, it found\nthe standard procedure of shackling prisoners during public transit between the holding\ncell and the courtroom to be a reasonable security precaution and denied without\nprejudice the request to transfer the case to Rancho Cucamonga.\n       Later, defendant appeared in court to personally waive his presence at that and all\nfuture pretrial hearings. Although his legs were shackled at the time, the court assured\ndefendant the shackles would be removed in the courtroom if he chose to participate in\nthe proceedings. After defendant waived his presence, counsel asked he not be\ntransported to court again until the penalty phase jury trial or transfer of the case to\nRancho Cucamonga.\n       The balance of pretrial proceedings as well as the guilt phase bench trial took\nplace in San Bernardino. Thereafter, defendant filed a written request to have the penalty\nphase tried in Rancho Cucamonga with jurors from its West End Judicial District. The\ntrial court denied the request in part, ordering that jury selection occur in San Bernardino\nbut that the panel be drawn exclusively from the West End. Defendant was ordered to\npersonally appear to address jury selection issues but his counsel objected, claiming that\nthe court‘s promises concerning shackling had not been kept and again objecting to the\nin-transit shackling. The court overruled the objection, finding it had accommodated\ndefendant throughout the proceedings. Subsequent pre-penalty-phase proceedings and\nthe initial portion of jury selection (primarily hardship excusals and challenges for cause\nbased on the juror questionnaires) took place in San Bernardino, but the remainder of jury\n\n\n                                              20\n\fselection and the penalty phase trial took place in Rancho Cucamonga, after which there\nwere no further shackling objections.\n\n              b) Analysis\n       No defendant ―may be subjected, before conviction, to any more restraint than is\nnecessary for his [or her] detention to answer the charge.‖ (§ 688.) However, an\nappellate court will not overturn a trial court‘s decision to restrain a defendant ―absent ‗a\nshowing of a manifest abuse of discretion.‘ ‖ (People v. Wallace (2008) 44 Cal.4th 1032,\n1050 (Wallace).)\n       The jurisprudence on shackling primarily concerns situations that might prejudice\na jury. Such cases hold that under state law, in light of the potential harm to the\nconstitutional presumption of innocence and right to be present and participate in one‘s\ndefense, ― ‗[a] defendant cannot be subjected to physical restraints of any kind in the\ncourtroom while in the jury‘s presence, unless there is a showing of a manifest need for\nsuch restraints.‘ ‖ (Wallace, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1050, quoting People v. Duran\n(1976) 16 Cal.3d 282, 290–291; see People v. Harrington (1871) 42 Cal. 165, 168–169;\nsee also Deck v. Missouri (2005) 544 U.S. 622, 624.)\n       Defendant incorrectly assumes the propriety of shackling a defendant while in\ntransit through the public hallways of a courthouse to attend a pretrial hearing, the factual\nscenario presented here, should be assessed under the same standards used to determine\nwhether a defendant can be shackled while in the courtroom. Not so. The considerations\nof public safety and the need for restraints are different during prisoner transport than\nwhen a defendant is seated in a secured courtroom. We have long observed that a\ndefendant may be restrained while in transit between a jail and the courtroom without\nreference to any particularized showing of need. (See, e.g., People v. Ross (1967) 67\nCal.2d 64, 72 [―It was a reasonable practice for the sheriff to keep prisoners handcuffed\nwhile in transit, and the fact that the handcuffs were removed inside the courtroom rather\n\n\n                                             21\n\fthan outside added to the security.‖]; People v. Metzger (1904) 143 Cal. 447, 449 [―In\nmany cases it is proper, and it is often necessary as a precaution, to manacle a prisoner to\nsecure his safe conduct and guard against an escape while on the way from the jail to the\ncourtroom.‖]); see also People v. Hardy (1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 180; accord, People v.\nJacobs (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1135, 1140–1141; People v. Du Bose (1970) 10\nCal.App.3d 544, 549–550; U. S. v. Leach (8th Cir. 1970) 429 F.2d 956, 962.].)\n       Accordingly, we see no abuse of discretion in the use of physical restraints during\ndefendant‘s transit through the public hallways of the San Bernardino courthouse without\nany particularized showing of need. The shackling was a reasonable and limited\nprecaution taken to retain custody of an accused and was no more restraint than was\nnecessary for his detention. The in-transit physical restraints in no way affected the\nconduct or outcome of the trial, whether before judge or jury, nor did they impinge upon\nthe presumption of innocence or defendant‘s right to present a defense.\n       In his reply, defendant argues that given the necessity of shackling him for\ntransport through the halls to his courtroom in San Bernardino, ―the unreasonable burden\nplaced on this defendant should have been ameliorated by moving the proceeding to a\ndifferent courtroom or to Rancho Cucamonga.‖ He cites no authority to support this\nproposition, nor are we aware of any. As noted, defendant‘s shackling for security during\ntransport was a limited and reasonable imposition. The trial court was not required to\nmove the proceedings to a different courtroom or to the Rancho Cucamonga courthouse\nsimply to obviate this precaution.\n\n          2. Waiver of the right to be present at pretrial and guilt phase\n             proceedings\n       Defendant claims the trial court violated his state and federal constitutional rights\nto due process and a fair trial when it excused him from numerous pretrial proceedings\nand the guilt phase of his trial based on a waiver of his personal presence that allegedly\nwas coerced by ―painful, excessive, and unnecessary shackling.‖ He additionally\n\n                                             22\n\fcontends the trial court violated sections 977 and 1043 by accepting involuntary waivers\nof his right to be personally present at the guilt phase of his capital murder trial without\nadequate justification.\n\n              a) Constitutional right to be present\n       ―Under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to be personally present at\nany proceeding in which his appearance is necessary to prevent ‗interference with [his]\nopportunity for effective cross-examination.‘ [Citations.] Due process guarantees the\nright to be present at any ‗stage . . . that is critical to [the] outcome‘ and where the\ndefendant‘s ‗presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure.‘ ‖ (People v.\nButler (2009) 46 Cal.4th 847, 861.) The state constitutional right to be present at trial,\nwhich is guaranteed by article I of the California Constitution, ― ‗is generally coextensive\nwith the federal due process right.‘ ‖ (Butler, at p. 861.) As a matter of both federal and\nstate constitutional law, however, a defendant may validly waive his or her right to be\npresent during a critical stage of the trial, provided the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and\nvoluntary. (People v. Moon (2005) 37 Cal.4th 1, 20–21 (Moon); People v. Jackson\n(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1164, 1210 (Jackson).)\n       Defendant premises his challenge to the voluntariness of his right to be present\nwaivers entirely on the argument that the waivers were induced and coerced by improper\nshackling. He contends he was forced to waive his presence ―simply because he could\nnot endure the effects of the wrist, waist and leg chains every day for more than eight\nhours a day.‖ (Italics added.) The record demonstrates, however, that the trial court\nrelieved defendant of all physical restraints in the courtroom and holding cell prior to any\nevidentiary hearings or critical phases of the postarraignment proceedings. Thereafter,\ndefendant remained subjected to physical restraints only for the time it took to transport\nhim to and from the holding cell and the courtroom. Having concluded that this limited\nin-transit shackling was not an abuse of the trial court‘s discretion, we further conclude\n\n\n                                              23\n\fthe use of restraints in transit did not improperly coerce defendant to waive his presence\nat the pretrial and guilt phase proceedings, particularly as the court permitted him to\nremain completely unrestrained in the courtroom.\n         An analogous situation was presented in People v. Price (1991) 1 Cal.4th 324\n(Price). After a hearing outside the presence of the jury during which the evidence\nestablished the defendant had committed multiple acts and threats of violence against\nofficers at the jail or while being transported to court, the court ordered he be secured to\nhis chair in the courtroom by a single belly chain not visible to the jury. The defendant\nthen stated ―he would rather be absent from the trial than appear before the jury in chains.\nThe trial court allowed defendant to leave the courtroom and return to the jail, after\ninforming defendant that his leaving would be construed as a voluntary waiver of\npresence. After giving the matter further thought, the court directed jail officers to bring\ndefendant back to the courtroom, but defendant refused to dress in civilian clothing for\nthe court appearance. The court then concluded that defendant had effectively waived his\npresence. The remainder of the guilt phase proceeded in his absence.‖ (Id. at pp. 404–\n405.)\n         On appeal, we found ―no constitutional infirmity in the trial court‘s decisions . . .\nto accept defendant‘s actions as a voluntary waiver and to proceed with the guilt phase in\ndefendant‘s absence.‖ (Price, supra, 1 Cal.4th at p. 405.) Similarly here, we find no\nconstitutional infirmity in defendant‘s waivers of his right to be present at pretrial\nproceedings and the guilt phase, even assuming such waivers were motivated in part by\nconcerns about the in-transit shackling that would have accompanied his appearing in\ncourt.\n\n                b) Statutory right to be present\n         The issue of statutory error is another matter. As we have previously\nacknowledged, ―defendant‘s statutory ability to waive his presence in a capital case is\n\n\n                                               24\n\fmore circumscribed than the associated ability to waive his constitutional right.‖ (People\nv. Rundle (2008) 43 Cal.4th 76, 135 (Rundle); see also Jackson, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p.\n1211.) Specifically, section 977 requires any defendant charged with a felony to ―be\npersonally present at the arraignment, at the time of plea, during the preliminary hearing,\nduring those portions of the trial when evidence is taken before the trier of fact, and at the\ntime of the imposition of sentence. The accused shall be personally present at all other\nproceedings unless he or she shall, with leave of court, execute in open court, a written\nwaiver of his or her right to be personally present, as provided by paragraph (2).‖ (§ 977,\nsubd. (b)(1), italics added.) Section 1043 provides that a felony defendant ―shall be\npersonally present at the trial‖ (id., subd. (a)), but that the trial may continue in a\ndefendant‘s absence if the defendant (1) persists in disruptive behavior after being\nwarned (id., subd. (b)(1)); (2) is voluntarily absent in ―[a]ny prosecution for an offense\nwhich is not punishable by death‖ (id., subd. (b)(2), italics added); or (3) has waived his\nrights ―in accordance with Section 977‖ (id., subd. (d)). Read together, the statutes\nprovide that a capital defendant cannot voluntarily waive his right to be present during\nthe proceedings listed in section 977, including those portions of the trial in which\nevidence is taken, and he may not be removed from the courtroom pursuant to section\n1043 unless he has been disruptive or threatens to be disruptive.\n       Defendant correctly contends his absence during the guilt phase violated sections\n977 and 1043. However, assuming defendant has not forfeited his claim of statutory\nerror by failing to raise it below (see Rundle, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 135), the error does\nnot warrant reversal of the judgment because it is not reasonably probable the result of\nthe trial would have been more favorable to defendant absent the error. (See People v.\nWeaver (2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 968.) Defendant fails to explain how he could have\neffectively assisted counsel in subjecting the prosecution‘s case to meaningful adversarial\ntesting. We therefore conclude the violations of sections 977 and 1043 were harmless.\n(See, e.g., Moon, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 21.)\n                                               25\n\f        Relying upon Hicks v. Oklahoma (1980) 447 U.S. 343, 346, defendant also\ncontends the statutory violation deprived him of his federal constitutional procedural due\nprocess rights because the ―arbitrary‖ violation of section 977 and section 1043 allegedly\ndeprived him of a state-created ―liberty interest‖ in the proper application of state law.\nWe have previously rejected this exact argument. (See Rundle, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p.\n136.)\n\n           3. Waiver of the right to a guilt phase jury\n        Defendant claims the ―wanton infliction of pain‖ caused by the daily courthouse\nshackling not only coerced a waiver of his right to be present at the guilt phase, but also\nresulted in the involuntary waiver of his right to a jury trial at the guilt phase in order to\navoid the alleged ―embarrassment and prejudice‖ attendant to being tried by a jury while\nhe was not present. He argues the failure to obtain a knowing and intelligent waiver of\nhis right to a jury trial violated his state and federal constitutional right to due process and\nrequires the reversal of his conviction. As with his claim concerning the waiver of his\nright to be present, this claim is without merit.\n        At a pretrial status conference, the prosecutor informed the court he had discussed\nwith defense counsel the possibility of having a bench trial for the guilt phase. Defense\ncounsel confirmed, stating ―I am inclined to agree to recommend to my client that if he‘s\nagreeable, then we‘re agreeable to a court trial on the guilt phase[, although w]e would\nstill want a jury trial in the penalty phase.‖ At the next status conference, defense counsel\nconfirmed defendant had filed a written waiver of his right to a jury trial of the guilt\nphase, stating, ―[W]e don‘t wish to have a jury decide [the issue of defendant‘s guilt or\ninnocence,] just the court.‖ The court indicated a personal appearance by defendant was\nrequired for the waiver to be effective.\n        Defendant subsequently appeared in person via closed-circuit television to waive\nhis right to a guilt phase jury trial. In response to questioning by the court, defendant\n\n\n                                              26\n\findicated he understood (1) he had an absolute right to a jury trial in both the guilt and\npenalty phases of his trial, (2) in a jury trial, if one of the 12 jurors was not convinced\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty, the jury could not return a guilty\nverdict, (3) if he waived his right to a jury trial, instead of 12 people deciding the issue of\nhis guilt or innocence, the judge alone would make that decision, and (4) it could be\neasier for the prosecution to convince only one person, as opposed to 12, that defendant\nwas guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant nevertheless stated he wished to waive\nhis right to a jury trial for the guilt phase, confirming he had discussed the issue with his\ncounsel, who concurred in the waiver.\n       As relevant here, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:\n―In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public\ntrial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been\ncommitted . . . .‖ (See also Cal. Const., art. I, § 16 (―Trial by jury is an inviolate right and\nshall be secured to all . . . .‖].) Although trial by jury is a fundamental constitutional\nright, a criminal defendant may waive the right. (See Adams v. United States (1942) 317\nU.S. 269, 275; see also Cal. Const., art. I, § 16.) However, ―[a]s with the waiver . . . of\nseveral other constitutional rights . . . long . . . recognized as fundamental, [in order to be\nvalid] a defendant‘s waiver of the right to jury trial must be knowing and intelligent, that\nis, ‗ ― ‗made with a full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the\nconsequences of the decision to abandon it,‘ ‖ ‘ as well as voluntary, ‗ ― ‗in the sense that\nit was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or\ndeception.‘ ‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Collins (2001) 26 Cal.4th 297, 305.)\n       The conclusion defendant‘s waiver of a guilt phase jury was knowing, intelligent,\nand voluntary is supported by his clear express waiver, made in open court, with\ncounsel‘s consent and agreement, and after a full explanation from the court of the right\nand the consequences of the waiver. Conversely, the record does not support defendant‘s\ncontention that his waiver was induced by the ―inhumane courtroom restraints in the San\n                                              27\n\fBernardino County Courthouse.‖ Having been relieved of all physical restraints in the\ncourtroom and holding cell well before the guilt phase commenced, defendant would\nhave been restrained during the trial only for the time it took to transport him to and from\nthe holding cell and the courtroom. Having concluded this limited in-transit shackling\nwas not an abuse of the trial court‘s discretion and did not improperly coerce defendant to\nwaive his right to be present, we further conclude it did not improperly coerce\ndefendant‘s waiver of his right to a jury trial for the guilt phase, particularly as he was\npermitted to remain completely unrestrained while in the courtroom.\n\n           4. The guilt phase bench trial as tantamount to a “slow plea of guilty”\n       Defendant claims defense counsel failed to mount a defense at the guilt phase—\npresenting no affirmative witnesses, evidence, or defenses and conceding defendant‘s\nguilt on all the charges—and contends this failure was the ―functional equivalent of a\nslow plea of guilty‖ that denied defendant his state and federal constitutional rights to\nenter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea following a full advisement of rights and\nexpress waiver of those rights. Respondent argues that defendant forfeited this claim by\nrepeatedly rejecting the trial court‘s offers to set aside the guilt phase verdict and grant\nhim a new guilt phase trial with or without a jury, or, in the alternative, that defendant is\nbarred from raising it under the doctrine of invited error. We need not decide the\nforfeiture and invited error issues, however, because even assuming the claim has not\nbeen forfeited and is not barred, it lacks merit.\n       In In re Mosley (1970) 1 Cal.3d 913, we stated that if a defendant‘s stipulation to\nsubmit a case for decision on the basis of the transcripts of the preliminary hearing is, in\nthe circumstances of the particular case, ―tantamount to a plea of guilty,‖ it must be\naccompanied by Boykin-Tahl advice and waivers, that is, the advisement and express\npersonal waiver of three specific constitutional rights—the rights to a jury trial, to\nconfront and cross-examine witnesses, and against self-incrimination. (Mosley, at p. 924;\n\n\n                                              28\n\fid. at p. 925 & p. 926, fn. 10; see Boykin v. Alabama (1969) 395 U.S. 238; In re Tahl\n(1969) 1 Cal.3d 122.) The phrase ― ‗tantamount to a plea of guilty‘ ‖ was used ―to\nexplain [the] extension of the Boykin-Tahl requirements to submissions in which the guilt\nof the defendant was apparent on the basis of the evidence presented at the preliminary\nhearing and in which conviction was a foregone conclusion if no defense was offered.‖\n(Bunnell v. Superior Court (1975) 13 Cal.3d 592, 602 (Bunnell).)2 We have further\nsuggested that ―a ‗slow plea‘ of guilty‖ may occur where a defendant submits the issue of\nhis or her guilt of the charged offense on the basis of the police report (In re Jennings\n(2004) 34 Cal.4th 254, 265, fn. 5) or ―other documentation‖ (People v. Watson (2007) 42\nCal.4th 822, 826, fn. 3), or where a defendant in a capital case submits the issue of\npenalty on the transcript of prior proceedings (People v. Robertson (1989) 48 Cal.3d 18,\n39 (Robertson)).\n       In Robertson, we explained that ―submission‖ within the meaning of the slow plea\ndoctrine ―is defined by the rights a defendant surrenders.‖ (Robertson, supra, 48 Cal.3d\nat p. 40.) ―Although the parties may reserve the right to present additional evidence, the\nessential components of a submission are waiver of a jury trial and, with respect to the\nwitnesses who testified in the prior proceedings, waiver of the right to confrontation in\nthe present proceeding. [Citations.] When the submission is a ‗slow plea‘ or ‗tantamount\nto a plea of guilty,‘ the defendant also gives up his privilege against self-incrimination.‖\n(Ibid.; see Wright, supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 495 [―If the submission does not amount to a\nslow plea of guilty, there is no involuntary confession of guilt.‖].)\n       Defendant‘s stipulation to a bench trial for the guilt phase in this case was not\ntantamount to a plea of guilty. (See Robertson, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 40; People v.\n\n2      In Bunnell, as a matter of judicial policy we mandated Boykin-Tahl advisements\nand waivers in all cases submitted for decision on the basis of the transcript of the\npreliminary hearing. (Bunnell, supra, 13 Cal.3d at p. 605.) But unless the submission\nwas tantamount to a plea of guilty, a Bunnell error requires reversal only if the error was\nprejudicial to the defendant. (People v. Wright (1987) 43 Cal.3d 487, 494–495 (Wright).)\n                                             29\n\fHendricks (1987) 43 Cal.3d 584, 592–594; Wright, supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 497.) Although\nin agreeing to the stipulation defendant gave up his right to a jury trial, he was advised of\nand personally waived this right. In so stipulating he did not give up the right to\nconfrontation and cross-examination or to remain silent. To the contrary, defendant\nenjoyed a full court trial during which he confronted, cross-examined, and attempted to\nimpeach the prosecution witnesses, and exercised his right against self-incrimination by\nnot taking the witness stand. Having fully exercised these rights, there was no need for\ndefendant to waive them. Additionally, defense counsel conceded neither guilt nor the\nnecessary elements of the various offenses, but rather required the prosecution to prove\nevery element of every crime through the testimony of 16 witnesses and attempted to\nraise reasonable doubt in various areas. As counsel stated in closing argument, although\ndefendant may have wished to take responsibility for the crimes, ―failing a settlement that\nI can live with, as a lawyer I must contest the charges.‖\n\n          5. The admission of defendant’s statements to law enforcement officers\n             and his videotaped reenactment\n       Defendant claims the trial court erred in admitting in both the guilt and penalty\nphases of the trial the contents of his custodial interrogations and his videotaped\nreenactment at the SOS store, in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights to\ndue process, to be free from self-incrimination, and to be subjected to custodial\ninterrogation only with the assistance of counsel. According to defendant, law\nenforcement officers deliberately violated Miranda, supra, 384 U.S. 436, ignored an\nunambiguous request for counsel, and used a variety of coercive tactics that, when\nconsidered in their totality, demonstrate his statements were involuntary. He argues that\nas a result, the incriminating statements were the product of repeated and intentional\nviolations of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution, and that the\nallegedly erroneous admission of the confessions was prejudicial.\n\n                                             30\n\f       As discussed below, we conclude defendant understood the Miranda warnings he\nwas given, validly waived his Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent and to an attorney,\nand made uncoerced statements to law enforcement officers. We therefore reject\ndefendant‘s arguments regarding his taped statements and the video reenactment.\n\n              a) Background\n       The prosecution first sought to introduce defendant‘s various interviews and the\nvideo reenactment during the preliminary hearing. Defense counsel objected. At a\nhearing on the issue, a magistrate judge found the detectives did not violate Miranda,\nsupra, 384 U.S. 436, did not make any false statements inducing the confessions, and did\nnot improperly fail to clarify a request for counsel. The judge further concluded\ndefendant was properly advised of and knew his rights, and the statements and the video\nreenactment were made freely and voluntarily.\n       Before the guilt phase, defense counsel moved to suppress the custodial\nstatements, any resulting admissions, and the video reenactment. The trial court held an\nevidentiary hearing at which evidence was presented concerning defendant‘s previous\ninterrogations by law enforcement officers in April 1982 and January 1988 in connection\nwith charges of oral copulation with Michelle I. and child molestation of Samira S.,\nrespectively. In each instance, defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and asked if\nhe understood them, whether he wanted to talk about the case, and whether he wanted a\nlawyer; in each instance defendant agreed to talk to the officers without a lawyer and\neither wrote down his responses to the waiver questions or signed a waiver statement.\n       Ontario Police Department detectives testified about an exchange that occurred\nduring the preliminary six minutes of their initial meeting with defendant in Deadwood,\nSouth Dakota before they gave him the first Miranda warning. After introductions and\ngeneral questions about defendant‘s welfare, defendant asked detectives whether his\ngirlfriend, Costello, was in jail. Detective Ortiz responded, ―She‘s in our custody. She‘s\n\n\n                                            31\n\fsafeguarded.‖3 When defendant claimed that Costello was ―not involved in any of this‖\nand ―shouldn‘t be in custody,‖ the detectives responded, ―[T]hat‘s what we need to find\nout from you. . . . And this is your opportunity, okay . . . . We both have [the] suspicion\n. . . that . . . she didn‘t have nothing [sic] to do with anything that happened before . . .\nyou started running. But basically we wanted to find out from you.‖ They also related\narriving at Folsom Prison to transport defendant to the video reenactment. The trial court\nadditionally considered the preliminary hearing testimony of three law enforcement\nofficers who were involved in the traffic stop and arrest of defendant.\n       Finally, several police officers testified concerning the department‘s practice at the\ntime of defendant‘s interrogations of deliberately omitting the ―express waiver‖ question\nfrom Ontario Police Department form 4.17, from which Miranda advisements were read.\nThat question asked whether, having the Miranda rights in mind, the suspect wished to\ntalk to about the case. The practice of omitting this question was based on police\ntraining, information gleaned from prosecutors, and confirmation from the courts\nindicating such waiver was unnecessary. In October 1992, after defendant was\ninterrogated, the San Bernardino County District Attorney‘s Office issued a\nmemorandum advising the department to ask the express waiver question in their\ninterrogations.\n       With respect to the motion to suppress, the trial court found the detectives‘\ncomments during the first six minutes of the initial Deadwood interview, prior to giving a\nMiranda admonition about Costello being ―in custody‖ and ―safeguarded,‖ to which\ndefendant responded by protesting Costello‘s innocence, constituted psychological\ninducement or ―softening up‖ likely to evoke incriminating statements. Therefore,\ndefendant‘s responses during that time had been obtained in violation of Miranda. As to\nhis later statements after the first Miranda admonition, the court found by a\n\n3     It appears that Costello in fact was staying at a hotel with a law enforcement\nmatron.\n                                               32\n\fpreponderance of the evidence under the totality of the circumstances that defendant\nunderstood his constitutional rights, and his implied waiver of those rights ―was\nvoluntary and was a result of his own desire to make statements‖ and not the product of\nthe prior improper influences. The trial court also found that: (1) defendant‘s\nincriminating statements were not induced by improper police conduct; (2) there was no\nbad faith intent to violate his Miranda rights, as the detectives had a good faith belief that\nthe practice of not obtaining an express waiver was lawful; (3) defendant‘s ambiguous\ncomment about having ―someone here to talk for me‖ did not constitute an invocation of\nthe right to counsel; and (4) no further Miranda advisements were required for the\nsecond, third and fourth Deadwood interviews because their purpose was merely to\nbriefly clarify matters covered in the first interrogation.\n       With respect to the video reenactment, the court found (1) Sergeant Lewis‘s\ninquiry at Folsom Prison concerning whether defendant was willing to cooperate with\nauthorities in an ―ongoing investigation of a murder in a warehouse‖ was not a custodial\ninterrogation requiring a Miranda warning, and nothing Lewis said or did improperly\ninduced defendant‘s agreement to cooperate; (2) later, more specific questioning by the\ndetectives who went to the prison to retrieve defendant for the reenactment was improper\nbecause an affirmative answer to the question whether defendant remained willing ―to\nreenact the crimes,‖ in and of itself, would be incriminating, but this one question did not\ninfluence defendant‘s previous agreement to cooperate; and (3) the reenactment was\nvalidly conducted after a full Miranda advisement with an express waiver.\n       Consequently, the court ruled defendant‘s multiple statements and confessions\nwere admissible in the prosecution‘s case-in-chief during both the guilt and penalty\nphases of the trial, with the exception of the first six minutes of the initial interview and\nthe in-prison questioning of defendant specifically about reenacting the crimes.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f              b) Analysis\n       Defendant advances various arguments in support of the proposition the trial court\nerred in failing to suppress his statements to law enforcement officers and the video\nreenactment as obtained in contravention of his constitutional right against compelled\nself-incrimination. None of these arguments are persuasive.\n\n                  (1) Alleged deliberate violation of Miranda\n       Defendant argues his custodial statements should have been suppressed because\nthey were obtained after a deliberate violation of Miranda, supra, 384 U.S. 436. This\ndeliberate violation allegedly occurred when, during the first interview, Detectives\nNottingham and Ortiz intentionally declined to seek an express waiver of defendant‘s\nright to silence after giving the Miranda advisement.\n       In general, if a custodial suspect, having heard and understood a full explanation\nof his or her Miranda rights, then makes an uncompelled and uncoerced decision to talk,\nhe or she has thereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived them. (Colorado\nv. Spring (1987) 479 U.S. 564, 574.) Law enforcement officers are not required to obtain\nan express waiver of a suspect‘s Miranda rights prior to a custodial interview. (See\nNorth Carolina v. Butler (1979) 441 U.S. 369, 373 (Butler) [―An express written or oral\nstatement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong\nproof of the validity of that waiver, but is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to\nestablish waiver.‖].) Rather, a valid waiver of Miranda rights may, as here, be inferred\nfrom the defendant‘s words and actions. (Butler, at p. 373.) As the detectives who\ninterrogated defendant were not required to obtain an express waiver of the right to\nsilence from him, the intentional failure to do so was not a deliberate Miranda violation\nrequiring the suppression of his subsequent statements.\n\n                  (2) Alleged coercion of defendant’s custodial statements\n       Alternatively, defendant contends his incriminating custodial statements were\ninvoluntary in light of a combination of other factors, including his compromised mental\n                                              34\n\fstate, the detectives‘ use of deception, and their implied promise to help his companion,\nCostello.\n       The test for the voluntariness of a custodial statement is whether the statement is\n― ‗the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice‘ ‖ or whether the\ndefendant‘s ― ‗will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically\nimpaired‘ ‖ by coercion. (Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973) 412 U.S. 218, 225.) No\nsingle factor is dispositive; ―rather courts consider the totality of [the] circumstances.‖\n(People v. Williams (1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 661 (Williams); see People v. Neal (2003) 31\nCal.4th 63, 79 (Neal).) Relevant considerations include ― ‗the crucial element of police\ncoercion [citation]; the length of the interrogation [citation]; its location [citation]; its\ncontinuity‘ as well as ‗the defendant‘s maturity [citation]; education [citation]; physical\ncondition [citation]; and mental health.‘ ‖ (Williams, at p. 660; see Neal, at p. 84\n[appellate review entails ― ‗inquiry into all the circumstances,‘ including ‗evaluation of\n[defendant‘s] age, experience, education, background, and intelligence‘ ‖].)\n       ―In assessing allegedly coercive police tactics, ‗[t]he courts have prohibited only\nthose psychological ploys which, under all the circumstances, are so coercive that they\ntend to produce a statement that is both involuntary and unreliable.‘ ‖ (People v. Smith\n(2007) 40 Cal.4th 483, 501; see, e.g., People v. Kendrick (1961) 56 Cal.2d 71, 84\n(Kendrick) [―a confession has been held involuntary and inadmissible where it was\nobtained as a result of . . . such inducements as a promise to do for an accused all that\ncould be done [citation] or to protect the accused‘s family from retaliation [citation] or a\nstatement that if the accused confessed the punishment would be lighter [citation] or that\nit would be better for him to confess [citation] or by threats to hold the accused‘s\nmother‖].)\n       Additionally, although coercive police conduct is a necessary predicate, such\nconduct does not compel a finding that the resulting statement is involuntary. (People v.\nJablonski (2006) 37 Cal.4th 774, 814 (Jablonski).) A confession is involuntary only if\n                                               35\n\fthe coercive police conduct at issue and the defendant‘s statement are causally related.\n(Colorado v. Connelly (1986) 479 U.S. 157, 164, fn. 2, & 167; Jablonski, at p. 814 [The\npolice misconduct ― ‗must be . . . the ―proximate cause‖ of the statement in question, and\nnot merely a cause in fact.‘ ‖]; see, e.g., People v. Guerra (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1067, 1095–\n1096 [the defendant‘s statements were not coerced by false threats of arrest; the sole\ncause appearing in the record for his cooperation during the interview was the desire to\nexculpate himself]; Williams, supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 661 [promises of leniency were ―not\nthe motivating cause of [the] defendant‘s admissions‖].)\n       Here, even assuming, as the trial court found, the detectives engaged in improper\n―softening up‖ at the outset of the first interview by claiming defendant‘s companion,\nCostello, was in custody and implying defendant could exonerate her by speaking to\nthem, the totality of the circumstances of the interrogation support the conclusion\ndefendant‘s statements given after he was later advised of his Miranda rights were\nvoluntary and not the product of psychological inducement. The detectives‘ comments\nconcerning Costello were relatively brief, lasting only three-to-four minutes of the\npreliminary six minutes of the interview and fell ―far short of a threat to arrest‖ Costello\nunless defendant confessed. (Kendrick, supra, 56 Cal.2d at p. 86.) Importantly, the\ncomments were immediately followed by the first of two Miranda advisements given to\ndefendant, following both of which defendant stated unequivocally he understood the\nrights read to him and continued to talk to the detectives and to answer their questions.\n(Cf. People v. Honeycutt (1977) 20 Cal.3d 150, 158, 160 [a half-hour of ―clever\nsoftening-up, . . . disparagement of the victim and ingratiating conversation‖ induced the\ndefendant to agree to talk about the homicide well before being advised of his Miranda\nrights].)\n       During the interview, defendant indicated several times that, for various personal\nreasons, he had decided beforehand to talk to the detectives about the case. Defendant‘s\npre-interview decision is the sole reason appearing in the record for his cooperation. It\n                                             36\n\fthus does not appear the detectives‘ alleged attempts at softening up defendant overcame\nhis will to resist or his ability to freely determine whether he wanted to talk to the\ndetectives, such that it could be said the short discussion regarding Costello was the\nproximate cause of defendant‘s later incriminating statements.\n       We further note neither the length nor physical circumstances of the interrogation\nappear to have been coercive; the initial interview was spread over a four-hour period\nwith the detectives offering defendant both food and drink. Nor was the tone of the\nquestioning as evidenced in the transcript particularly harsh or accusatory.\n       Additionally, at the time of the interview, defendant was ―a man of mature years\nwith an extensive criminal history.‖ (Jablonski, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 815.) In his 42\nyears, he had had extensive prior contacts with law enforcement and the criminal justice\nsystem, including having served two prior prison terms and one prior county jail term. In\nconnection with his felony convictions, defendant twice had been interviewed by law\nenforcement officers, during which he was advised of and executed express written\nwaivers of his Miranda rights.\n       Finally, with respect to defendant‘s mental state, it does not appear the detectives\nexploited any psychiatric problems in order to produce the incriminating statements.\nBefore interviewing him, the detectives inquired about defendant‘s general welfare and\nmental state, and in response he expressed no concerns regarding his well-being or\ntreatment, stating he had slept 24 hours straight.\n       Defendant nevertheless argues his soft-spoken nature, various references to\ndreams and experiences in the Vietnam War, and ―consistently vague‖ responses\ndemonstrate his fragile mental state during the interview. We disagree. A fair\nassessment of the interview in its entirety shows defendant responded to the detectives‘\ninquiries while exhibiting normal emotions to be expected of a murder suspect facing his\naccusers and reliving the details of a horrible crime. That a murder suspect is soft-spoken\nis less an indication of mental illness than an understandable and expected reaction of a\n                                              37\n\fperson confronted with committing such horrendous crimes. Nor does the circumstance\ndefendant may have dreamed about the homicides and their likely ramifications\nnecessarily show the existence of mental defect. Although he became emotional at times,\ndefendant also took considerable time to weigh his responses before answering the\ndetectives‘ questions. Some answers may have required clarification, but they were\ngenerally responsive. We note the detectives believed the references to Vietnam were\ndefendant‘s attempt to build a defense.\n       Lastly, defendant‘s incriminating statements were not rendered involuntary by any\nmental disease or defect. Even if some of defendant‘s behavior was irrational or bizarre,\nthere is no evidence his ―abilities to reason or comprehend or resist were in fact so\ndisabled that he was incapable of free or rational choice.‖ (In re Cameron (1968) 68\nCal.2d 487, 498; see, e.g., People v. Frye (1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 988 (Frye) [defendant‘s\nconsumption of alcohol did not so impair his reasoning that ―he was incapable of freely\nand rationally choosing to waive his rights and speak with the officers‖]; People v.\nMayfield (1993) 5 Cal.4th 142, 204 [defendant, who throughout the lengthy interview\nsounded lucid, spoke clearly if somewhat slowly, and at times ―engaged in animated,\njocular, prideful, indignant or defiant conversation‖ with the detectives, was not mentally\nimpaired when he made his audiotaped statement].)\n\n                 (3) Failure to terminate the interrogation after defendant allegedly\n                     invoked his right to counsel\n       Defendant contends his incriminating statements should have been suppressed\nbecause detectives ignored an unambiguous request for an attorney. He claims he\ninvoked his right to counsel during the first interview when he stated, ―I committed an\narmed robbery yes. Should I have somebody here talking for me, is this the way it‘s\nsupposed to be?‖ We conclude defendant‘s vague question did not qualify as an\nunequivocal invocation of the right to counsel requiring the cessation of questioning.\n\n\n                                             38\n\f       Once a defendant has waived his or her right to counsel, as defendant impliedly\ndid at the outset of the interview, if that defendant has a change of heart and subsequently\ninvokes the right to counsel during questioning, officers must cease interrogation unless\nthe defendant‘s counsel is present or the defendant initiates further exchanges,\ncommunications, or conversations. (See Edwards v. Arizona (1981) 451 U.S. 477, 484–\n485.) For a statement to qualify as an invocation of the right to an attorney, however, the\ndefendant ―must unambiguously request counsel. . . . [H]e must articulate his desire to\nhave counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the\ncircumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.‖ (Davis v.\nUnited States (1994) 512 U.S. 452, 459 (Davis).) ―[A] reviewing court—like the trial\ncourt in the first instance—must ask whether, in light of the circumstances, a reasonable\nofficer would have understood a defendant‘s reference to an attorney to be an\nunequivocal and unambiguous request for counsel, without regard to the defendant‘s\nsubjective ability or capacity to articulate his or her desire for counsel, and with no\nfurther requirement imposed upon the officers to ask clarifying questions of the\ndefendant.‖ (People v. Gonzalez (2005) 34 Cal.4th 1111, 1125 (Gonzalez); see People v.\nWilliams (2010) 49 Cal.4th 405, 428 [―[T]he question of ambiguity in an asserted\ninvocation must include a consideration of the communicative aspect of the invocation—\nwhat would a listener understand to be the defendant‘s meaning.‖].)\n       Here, before the disputed exchange, defendant volunteered, ―I know what you\nguys are getting at. . . . I also want you to know that the reason why I‘m so calm is\nbecause I‘m where I belong.‖ When asked to clarify what he meant, defendant replied,\n―You know as well as I do that I committed an armed robbery in Ontario‖ at ―Mike‘s\ncompany.‖ When Detective Ortiz indicated he wanted additional clarification, defendant\nreiterated, ―I committed an armed robbery yes,‖ and then asked, ―Should I have\nsomebody here talking for me, is this the way it‘s supposed to be?‖ Far from\nunambiguously requesting counsel, defendant appeared to be expressing frustration at the\n                                             39\n\fdetectives‘ attempts to clarify his initial statements regarding the armed robbery. At\nmost, a reasonable officer could have understood defendant‘s inquiry as an indication he\nmight want an attorney, in which case the detectives still would not have been required to\nterminate the interrogation. (See Davis, supra, 512 U.S. at p. 459 [―[I]f a suspect makes\na reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in\nlight of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be invoking\nthe right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning.‖].)\n       Defendant complains the detectives should have asked questions to clarify whether\nhe was invoking his right to counsel. There is no requirement law enforcement officers\ninterrupt an interrogation to ask clarifying questions following a suspect‘s ambiguous or\nequivocal responses that might or might not be construed as an invocation of the right to\nan attorney. (Davis, supra, 512 U.S. at pp. 461–462; see People v. Farnam (2002) 28\nCal.4th 107, 181.) We again note defendant had extensive prior contacts with the police,\nincluding two interviews in which he expressly waived his right to counsel. The\ndetectives in this case ―could reasonably have assumed that defendant was capable of\nmaking an unequivocal request for counsel if he so desired.‖ (Gonzalez, supra, 34\nCal.4th at p. 1127.) Moreover, after defendant‘s question and before the resumption of\nquestioning, defendant was again advised of his Miranda rights, expressly stated he\nunderstood them, and continued to talk to the detectives rather than invoke his right to\ncounsel or to silence. Later in the interview, defendant specifically confirmed the intent\nto waive his right to counsel when he stated he did not want to fight the case, did not need\na lawyer, did not ―believe in the routine of lawyers, or courts and all that,‖ and did not\nfeel a lawyer could do anything for him.\n       Considering the totality of the circumstances, ―[s]hould I have somebody here\ntalking for me‖ was not an unambiguous request for counsel requiring detectives to cease\ninterrogating defendant. (See, e.g., Gonzalez, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 1126 [defendant‘s\nconditional statement that he wanted a lawyer ―if he was going to be charged‖ was not an\n                                             40\n\finvocation of right to counsel]; People v. Crittenden (1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 124, 128–131\n(Crittenden) [defendant‘s query—― ‗Did you say I could have a lawyer?‘ ‖—was a\nclarification of rights rather than an unambiguous invocation]; People v. Johnson (1993)\n6 Cal.4th 1, 27 [defendant‘s statements that ― ‗Maybe I ought to talk to my lawyer, you\nmight be bluffing, you might not have enough to charge murder‘ ‖ and that his mother\nwould secure ― ‗a high price[d]‘ lawyer‖ was not an invocation].)\n\n                 (4) Failure to suppress the videotaped reenactment\n       Finally, defendant raises various additional challenges to the admission of the\nvideotaped reenactment of the crimes. First, relying on People v. Bonillas (1989) 48\nCal.3d 757, and People v. Thompson (1980) 27 Cal.3d 303, defendant claims the\nreenactment should have been suppressed because the detectives took advantage of a\npostarrest delay in his arraignment, suggesting had his arraignment not been delayed,\ncounsel would have been appointed and likely would have advised defendant not to\nparticipate in the reenactment. Bonillas and Thompson, however, involved defendants\nwho had been arrested for the crimes that later formed the basis for their arraignments.\n(See Bonillas, at p. 787; Thompson, at p. 328.) In this case, defendant was arrested in\nSouth Dakota and returned to Folsom Prison for a parole violation unrelated to the SOS\ncrimes. No arrest warrant for the SOS homicides had issued before the reenactment.\nAccordingly, Bonillas and Thompson are inapposite.\n       In the alternative, defendant argues his Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached\nwhen he became the focus of the SOS investigation and the delay violated his right to\ncounsel regardless of the fact he was arrested and confined for a parole violation.\nHowever, ―[a] criminal defendant‘s right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth\nAmendment does not exist until the state initiates adversary judicial criminal\nproceedings, such as by formal charge or indictment.‖ (People v. DePriest (2007) 42\nCal.4th 1, 33 (DePriest); see Frye, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 987; see also People v.\n\n\n                                            41\n\fHuggins (2006) 38 Cal.4th 175, 244–245.) Moreover, the ―right to counsel is ‗offense\nspecific‘ ‖ and ―may be asserted only as to those offenses for which criminal proceedings\nhave formally begun.‖ (DePriest, supra, at p. 33; People v. Webb (1993) 6 Cal.4th 494,\n527.) Before the reenactment, there were no adversarial judicial proceedings, formal\ncharges, or indictment pending in connection with the SOS crimes. Thus, defendant‘s\nright to the assistance of counsel for those offenses had not attached at the time of the\nreenactment.\n       Defendant relies on Escobedo v. Illinois (1964) 378 U.S. 478, 490–491 to argue\nthe right to counsel attached when he became the focus of the detectives‘ investigation.\nDefendant‘s reliance on Escobedo is misplaced. As we have previously explained, the\nhigh court has made clear the right to counsel at issue there was related to the Fifth\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination and prophylactic measures available to\nsuspects undergoing custodial interrogation, and not the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel. (DePriest, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 34, fn. 9.) Moreover, the ―focus‖ rule\ndefendant urges that might once have applied in the context of the right against self-\nincrimination, has since been repudiated. (See, e.g., Stansbury v. California (1994) 511\nU.S. 318, 326.)\n       Finally, defendant claims the reenactment should have been suppressed because\nhis cooperation was improperly induced by Sergeant Lewis‘s ―promise‖ that he would be\ntransferred out of Folsom Prison. The record belies this claim. As the trial court found,\nLewis simply asked defendant whether he was willing to cooperate with an ongoing\ninvestigation and if so, detectives would be picking him up that weekend. Despite\ndefendant‘s concerns about being placed in administrative segregation and a high security\nunit, Lewis specifically testified that no promises concerning defendant‘s housing\nsituation at the prison were made to induce his cooperation. Additionally, any prior\nsoftening up regarding Costello that might have occurred during the initial interview was\n\n\n                                             42\n\fnot a factor at the time of the reenactment, as Costello had long been cleared of any\nsuspected wrongdoing. The reenactment thus was properly admitted.\n\n          6. Cumulative prejudice\n       Defendant contends that even if the alleged errors at the guilt phase of the trial\nwere individually harmless, they were cumulatively prejudicial. We have found a single\nerror, a violation of defendant‘s statutory right to be present, and, assuming the issue was\nnot forfeited, concluded that error was harmless. There are no additional errors to\ncumulate and therefore no cumulative prejudice.\n\n       B. Penalty Phase Issues\n\n          1. Jury selection issues\n\n              a) Exclusion of Hispanic jurors from the penalty phase jury.\n       Defendant alleges that the jury selection procedures utilized in the Rancho\nCucamonga District of the San Bernardino County Superior Court systematically\nexcluded Hispanics and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the jury\nvenire. As a result, he contends, his penalty phase jury was not composed of a\nrepresentative cross-section of the community, depriving him of his right to due process\nand a fair trial before an impartial jury in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution and article I, section 16 of the California\nConstitution. The error, he argues, is structural, requiring automatic reversal.\n       We conclude the trial court did not err in denying defendant‘s motion to quash, as\ndefendant failed to make a prima facie showing of the systematic exclusion of Hispanic\njurors. This claim therefore is without merit.\n\n                  (1) Background\n       During penalty phase jury selection, defendant filed a motion to quash the jury\npanel on the ground Hispanics were systematically excluded from those summoned for\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\fservice in the Rancho Cucamonga District. The trial court conducted a hearing on the\nmotion, in which the following evidence was presented.\n       Shirley Stoudt, the Deputy Jury Commissioner of San Bernardino County Superior\nCourt, testified concerning how potential jurors were summoned from a master list\ncompiled from Department of Motor Vehicles and Registrar of Voters records, and then\nprocessed according to statutory exemptions as well as the California Rules of Court.\nThe jury commissioner‘s office was not aware of the race, religion, or ethnic background\nof the jurors when excusing or exempting them for service and, according to Stoudt, did\nnothing to keep any minority group off the jury panels. A voluntary countywide survey\nof potential jurors showed 4.3 percent were excused for language difficulties and 1.78\npercent were excused for lack of citizenship. Although these figures included all\nlanguages and noncitizens and the individuals were not asked to state their ethnic or\nracial background, she estimated that Hispanics and Spanish-speaking individuals would\nhave constituted a larger percentage of these groups than other ethnicities.\n       Julia Arias, a politically active elementary school teacher and community leader\nwho grew up in Fontana and Rancho Cucamonga, testified concerning her childhood,\neducation, and religious upbringing and the racial discrimination her family faced.4 Arias\nfelt Hispanics were underrepresented on juries because they were forced to refuse jury\nservice in order to preserve their ―meager pay‖ and because they were unaware of the\nimportance of exercising their right to vote. She then read various statistics from the\nWeeks study (discussed below) and suggested the court read the survey ―more carefully‖\nto find out what was happening to her community. John Weeks, Ph.D.,5 was retained by\n\n\n4      The trial court permitted Arias to give a narrative statement rather than respond to\nquestions from defense counsel.\n\n5     A professor of geography and director of the International Population Center at\nSan Diego State University, Weeks had previously qualified as an expert witness in\ndemography and statistics in more than 50 cases.\n                                            44\n\fthe defense to conduct a demographic survey of jurors reporting for jury duty in San\nBernardino County. Of 574 potential jurors for the Rancho Cucamonga District surveyed\nover the course of five weeks, 16.9 percent indicated they were Hispanic. Weeks\ncompared this to the 23.1 percent he estimated to be Hispanics in the ―juror eligible‖\npopulation in the Rancho Cucamonga District in 1995. Weeks geometrically\nextrapolated the 23.1 percent figure from 1980 and 1990 census data and from\nprojections of the ethnic makeup of every county in the state for 2000 and 2010 by the\nCalifornia Department of Finance, Demographic Research Unit. Based on these figures,\nWeeks found there was an ―absolute disparity‖6 of 6.2 percent between the number of\nHispanics reporting for jury duty and the number of eligible Hispanics residing in the\njudicial district. Dividing the absolute disparity of 6.2 percent by the community percent\nof 23.1, he concluded there was a ―relative disparity‖7 of 27 percent. Thus, according to\nWeeks, there were 27 percent fewer Hispanics in the Rancho Cucamonga jury pool than\nwould be expected from the demographics of the community. Dividing the results by\ngender, he further found an absolute disparity of 7.2 percent and relative disparity of 30\npercent for male Hispanics.8\n\n\n6      ― ‗Absolute disparity‘ is the difference between the underrepresented group‘s\npercentage in the jury-eligible population and the group‘s percentage in the actual jury\nvenire.‖ (People v. Anderson (2001) 25 Cal.4th 543, 564, fn. 6 (Anderson).)\n\n7       Relative or ― ‗comparative disparity‘ measures the percentage by which the\nnumber of group members in the actual venire falls short of the number of group\nmembers one would expect from the overall ‗eligible population‘ ‖ of the group who are\neligible for jury service. (Anderson, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 564, fn. 6; People v. Ramirez\n(2006) 39 Cal.4th 398, 441 (Ramirez); People v. Sanders (1990) 51 Cal.3d 471, 492, fn. 5\n(Sanders).) In this case, 6.2 percent divided by 23.1 percent is 26.8 percent.\n\n8      However, Weeks admitted on cross-examination that based solely on 1990 census\ndata, Hispanics comprised 18.7 percent of the jury-eligible population, which translated\nto an absolute disparity of Hispanic jurors of only 1.8 percent and a relative disparity of\n10 percent.\n                                            45\n\f        Relying on the above disparities, Weeks concluded there was ―a substantive and a\nstatistically significant underrepresentation of Hispanics showing up for jury duty in the\nRancho Cucamonga District courthouse.‖ The biggest alleged cause of the disparity was\nlack of follow-up by the jury commissioner‘s office for unserved jury summonses.\nWeeks also criticized the summons form for stating ―do not forward,‖ for prominently\ninviting excusal requests, and for not explicitly asking for address corrections. He\nbelieved this disadvantaged Hispanics who were more ―residentially mobile‖ than non-\nHispanics. Based on Weeks‘s opinions, defendant argued the court could end the\nsystematic discrimination and disenfranchisement of Hispanics in San Bernardino County\nby prohibiting the removal of jurors except for the reasons authorized under Code of\nCivil Procedure section 203,9 by preventing jury clerks from removing jurors without\njudicial authorization, and by taking measures to ensure adequate follow-up of jurors who\ninitially fail to appear for jury service. Weeks claimed that San Diego County had made\n―some remedies‖ in this regard, which increased the number of Hispanics on its master\nlist.\n        The trial court denied defendant‘s motion to quash the jury venire, ruling there\nwas no underrepresentation of Hispanics by significant numbers due to systematic\nexclusion in the jury selection process.\n\n9      Code of Civil Procedure section 203, subdivision (a), provides in part: ―All\npersons are eligible and qualified to be prospective trial jurors, except the following:\n       ―(1) Persons who are not citizens of the United States.\n       ―(2) Persons who are less than 18 years of age.\n       ―(3) Persons who are not domiciliaries of the State of California . . . .\n       ―(4) Persons who are not residents of the jurisdiction wherein they are summoned\nto serve.\n       ―(5) Persons who have been convicted of malfeasance in office or a felony, and\nwhose civil rights have not been restored.\n       ―(6) Persons who are not possessed of sufficient knowledge of the English\nlanguage . . . .\n       ―(7) Persons who are serving as grand or trial jurors in any court of this state.\n       ―(8) Persons who are the subject of conservatorship.‖\n                                             46\n\f                  (2) Analysis\n       ―In order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement,\nthe defendant must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a ‗distinctive‘ group\nin the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries\nare selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the\ncommunity; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the\ngroup in the jury-selection process.‖ (Duren v. Missouri (1979) 439 U.S. 357, 364.)\nDefendant ―satisfied the first prong of this test, because Hispanics are a ‗distinctive‘ or\ncognizable group.‖ (Ramirez, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 445; see Castaneda v. Partida\n(1977) 430 U.S. 482, 495.) With respect to the second prong, however, he failed to show\nthe representation of Hispanic jurors was unfair and unreasonable compared to their\nnumbers in the community.\n       Respondent contends the most reliable figures provided by defense expert Weeks,\nbased solely on 1990 census data, demonstrated an absolute disparity of Hispanic jurors\nof only 1.8 percent and a relative disparity of only 10 percent. But even assuming the\nstatistical disparities Weeks calculated based on extrapolations for 1995 were credible—\nan absolute disparity of 6.2 percent and a relative disparity of 27 percent for all\nHispanics, and an absolute disparity of 7.2 percent and relative disparity of 30 percent for\nmale Hispanics—defendant still failed to satisfy the second prong because such\ndisparities are not constitutionally significant. (See, e.g., People v. Burgener (2003) 29\nCal.4th 833, 856 (Burgener) [expressing uncertainty as to whether an absolute disparity\nof 10.7 percent, which produced a relative disparity of 65 percent, satisfied the second\nprong of the Duren test]; People v. Ramos (1997) 15 Cal.4th 1133, 1156 [concluding an\nabsolute disparity between 2.7 and 4.3 percent and a comparative disparity between 23.5\nand 37.4 percent was not constitutionally significant]; People v. Bell (1989) 49 Cal.3d\n502, 528, fn.15 [finding it was ―far from clear‖ that a 5 percent absolute disparity was\nsufficient]; see also Swain v. Alabama (1965) 380 U.S. 202, 208–209 [10 percent\n\n                                             47\n\fabsolute disparity inadequate]; U. S. v. Cannady (9th Cir. 1995) 54 F.3d 544, 548\n[―absolute disparities below 7.7% are insubstantial and constitutionally permissible‖].)\n       Even had defendant demonstrated a constitutionally significant disparity, he still\nwould have failed to satisfy the third prong of the test. ―A defendant does not discharge\nthe burden of demonstrating that the underrepresentation was due to systematic exclusion\nmerely by offering statistical evidence of a disparity. A defendant must show, in\naddition, that the disparity is the result of an improper feature of the jury selection\nprocess.‖ (Burgener, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 857.)\n       The Rancho Cucamonga District master list used in this case was derived from\nDepartment of Motor Vehicle‘s and voter registration lists. We have held that such a list\n― ‗ ―shall be considered inclusive of a representative cross-section of the population‖ ‘\nwhere it is properly nonduplicative.‖ (People v. Ochoa (2001) 26 Cal.4th 398, 427\n(Ochoa); see, e.g., Code Civ. Proc. § 197, subd. (b) [a master jury list assembled from\nlists of registered voters and driver‘s license holders, ―when substantially purged of\nduplicate names, shall be considered inclusive of a representative cross section of the\npopulation‖].) There is no suggestion that the master list was duplicative in any way.\n       As shown by the jury commissioner‘s testimony, moreover, juror excusals were\nbased on race-neutral reasons provided by statute and the California Rules of Court.\nIndeed, the excusal forms did not even indicate the prospective juror‘s race. The excusal\ncategories of non-citizenship and lack of understanding of English encompassed all\nethnicities and national origins, not simply Hispanics or Spanish-speaking individuals.\n―Where, as here, a county‘s jury selection criteria are neutral with respect to the\ndistinctive group, the defendant must identify some aspect of the manner in which those\ncriteria are applied that is not only the probable cause of the disparity but also\nconstitutionally impermissible.‖ (Burgener, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 858; see Sanders,\nsupra, 51 Cal.3d at pp. 492–493 [―Evidence that ‗race/class neutral jury selection\nprocesses may nonetheless operate to permit the de facto exclusion of a higher percentage\n                                              48\n\fof a particular class of jurors than would result from a random draw‘ is insufficient to\nmake out a prima facie case.‖].) Defendant failed to do so in this case.\n       Julia Arias, the community activist who testified for the defense, suggested\nHispanics were underrepresented because they were unaware of the importance of voting.\nHowever, ―the failure of a particular group to register to vote in proportion to its share of\nthe population cannot constitute improper exclusion attributable to the state.‖ (Ochoa,\nsupra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 427.) Arias also speculated Hispanics were forced to refuse jury\nservice in order to avoid losing the ―meager pay‖ they received in their employment.\nAnd defense expert John Weeks suggested, without citation to evidence, that Hispanics in\nRancho Cucamonga were ―residentially mobile‖ because they had low incomes, were\nunlikely to own homes and were transient as renters, and consequently more difficult to\nsummon for jury duty. However, ―[s]peculation as to the source of the disparity is\ninsufficient to show systematic exclusion [citation], as is evidence the disparity is\nunlikely to be a product of chance [citation] or has endured for some time [citation].‖\n(Burgener, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 858.)\n       Finally, Weeks opined San Bernardino County could have remedied the alleged\ndisparity in Hispanic jurors by following up on unserved summonses, soliciting address\ncorrections, and making the excusal form less prominent. Even assuming he was correct,\nmerely pointing to a remedy is not enough. (Ochoa, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 428.) The\nUnited States Constitution, while forbidding the exclusion of members of a cognizable\nclass of jurors, ― ‗ ―does not require that venires created by a neutral selection procedure\nbe supplemented to achieve the goal of selection from a representative cross-section of\nthe population.‖ ‘ [Citation.] So long as the state uses criteria that are neutral with\nrespect to the underrepresented group, the state‘s failure to adopt other measures to\nincrease the group‘s representation cannot satisfy Duren‘s third prong.‖ (Burgener,\nsupra, 29 Cal.4th at pp. 857–858.)\n\n\n                                             49\n\f       As defendant did not satisfy his burden under the second and third prongs of\nDuren, a prima facie case of underrepresentation and systematic exclusion of Hispanic\njurors was not made. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant‘s motion to\nquash the venire.\n\n              b) Exclusion of life-inclined juror for cause\n       Defendant claims the trial court erroneously excluded Prospective Juror G.P. for\ncause based solely on his written answers to a jury questionnaire and without any\nopportunity for voir dire. He contends that if G.P. had been given the opportunity to\nrespond to questions in person, the court could have clarified whether he was qualified to\nserve on a capital jury. As a result of the allegedly improper removal of this prospective\njuror, defendant argues he was subjected to ―a tribunal organized to return a verdict of\ndeath‖ in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution and article I, sections 15 and 16 of the California Constitution.\n       To the extent defendant asserts error in the court‘s ruling on challenges for cause\nbased solely on the jurors‘ responses to the questionnaires without voir dire, the claim is\nforfeited because he stipulated to this procedure. On the merits, we conclude the court\ndid not err in excusing Prospective Juror G.P. for cause based on his juror questionnaire,\nin which he stated an inability to impose the death penalty in a contested penalty phase.\n\n                    (1) Background\n       Before jury selection for the penalty phase, defendant moved for sequestered voir\ndire of prospective jurors.10 The trial court denied the request for individual voir dire of\nall jurors but acknowledged that oral or questionnaire responses might warrant\nsequestered voir dire of particular jurors on particular issues.\n\n\n\n10      Code of Civil Procedure section 223 provides that ―[v]oir dire of any prospective\njurors shall, where practicable, occur in the presence of the other jurors in all criminal\ncases, including death penalty cases.‖\n                                              50\n\f       Thereafter, the trial court proposed ruling on stipulated dismissals, followed by\nchallenges for cause based solely on questionnaire responses, noting that denial of any\nchallenge would be without prejudice, allowing counsel the opportunity to individually\nquestion the juror. ―Regular‖ voir dire would then be conducted on the rest of the panel.\nDefense counsel endorsed this procedure as ―the next best thing‖ to sequestered voir dire\nof the entire jury panel and commented on ―[t]he beauty of the Court‘s procedure‖ in\nprotecting against potential jurors who may ―pollute the panel.‖ As the time for jury\nselection neared, defendant personally appeared in court and expressly agreed to this\nprocedure, which the court, pursuant to the parties‘ stipulation, then utilized.\n       Both the prosecution and defense moved to exclude for cause various prospective\njurors solely on the basis of their questionnaire responses. Prospective Juror G.P. was\namong those whom the prosecutor challenged. In his questionnaire, when asked whether\nhe had ―any philosophical, religious, or moral feelings that would make it difficult or\nimpossible for you to sit in judgment of another person,‖ G.P. wrote ―being educated and\nraised in the strict Catholic teachings and standards, I find it hard to be a judge of another\nperson. I was taught that God is the only rightful judge.‖ Although he also wrote, ―I\nhave no problem in judging as to whether or not a person is guilty or has done wrong,‖ he\nindicated that he did ―have a problem as to whether or not punishment or appropriate\npunishment is right or wrong.‖ Despite his generally enjoying jury service ―because the\nlaw has always been fascinating‖ to him, G.P. reiterated, ―[i]t just so happens that\nsentencing someone is against my beliefs.‖\n       Prospective Juror G.P. further wrote he would be greatly influenced by the\nCatholic Church‘s opposition to the death penalty, writing ―I have always been taught to\ntry to understand why people become the way they are and that one might always forgive\nand that one might never lose hope. Somehow these teachings have become my own and\nhave influenced my decision in life.‖ G.P. reaffirmed he ―strongly‖ opposed the death\npenalty, opining it served only an economic purpose and was part of a system that ―has\n                                             51\n\flost all hope. That should not be the case in any system.‖ When asked ―what types of\ncrime, if any, deserve the death penalty,‖ he answered, ―I couldn‘t think of one.‖ G.P.\nalso wrote life in prison without parole served no purpose other than draining the\neconomy and he would ―only agree to it if it is the only solution for a person not to\ncommit harm to society again.‖\n       Prospective Juror G.P. indicated he would ―have to hear the case first‖ to know\nwhether he could impose life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. He\nalso stated it was ―very possible‖ to see himself rejecting the death penalty and choosing\nlife without possibility of parole ―because of my beliefs,‖ but rejecting life without the\npossibility of parole and choosing the death penalty was ―a possibility‖ only if the\ndefendant ―himself requests it and if he is sound in mind and body.‖\n       The defense argued that although Prospective Juror G.P. expressed a preference\nfor life without the possibility of parole, his responses also indicated he would be willing\nto listen to the case before selecting a punishment. The prosecution responded that G.P.‘s\nanswers demonstrated his religious beliefs, which taught him the death penalty was\nimproper, would override this willingness. Defense counsel did not ask to question G.P.\nin order to clarify his qualification to serve on a capital jury. Without conducting voir\ndire of G.P., the court granted the challenge for cause, finding his strong religious beliefs\ncombined with his strong opposition to the death penalty indicated he would be\n―substantially impaired in seriously considering the death penalty as an option.‖\n\n                  (2) Analysis\n       Defendant argues the trial court erred in failing to conduct voir dire to clarify\nProspective Juror G.P.‘s views on capital punishment and in granting the prosecutor‘s\nchallenge based on his juror questionnaire responses alone. However, defendant forfeited\nthis claim when he expressly agreed to that procedure. Defendant, moreover, did not\nrequest individual voir dire of Prospective Juror G.P. before the court ruled on the\n\n\n                                             52\n\fprosecutor‘s challenge for cause, instead opposing the challenge by arguing that G.P.‘s\nquestionnaire responses indicated he could be a fair juror. (People v. Cook (2007) 40\nCal.4th 1334, 1342 (Cook) [defendant who agreed to ― ‗submit on the questionnaire‘ ‖\nchallenges for cause to certain prospective jurors and waived any further questioning,\nforfeited right to complain on appeal of the court‘s failure to interrogate that prospective\njuror]; cf. People v. Stewart (2004) 33 Cal.4th 425, 452 (Stewart) [finding error where\ntrial court acted without the parties‘ prior agreement in granting several prosecution\nchallenges for cause solely on the basis of the questionnaire responses, despite earlier\nassurances that it would conduct further oral voir dire to address any ambiguous\nresponses and despite the defendant‘s repeated objections to the procedure].)\n       Alternatively, defendant contends the trial court erred in excluding Prospective\nJuror G.P. for cause simply because he expressed strong opposition to the death penalty\nin his questionnaire. A prospective juror‘s personal views concerning the death penalty\ndo not necessarily afford a basis for excusing the juror for bias in a capital case. (See\nUttecht v. Brown (2007) 551 U.S. 1, 6 [― ‗[A] man who opposes the death penalty, no less\nthan one who favors it, can make the discretionary judgment entrusted to him by the\nState.‘ ‖].) Rather, ―[t]o achieve the constitutional imperative of impartiality, the law\npermits a prospective juror to be challenged for cause only if his or her views in favor of\nor against capital punishment ‗would ―prevent or substantially impair the performance of\nhis [or her] duties as a juror‖ ‘ in accordance with the court‘s instructions and the juror‘s\noath.‖ (People v. Blair (2005) 36 Cal.4th 686, 741, quoting Wainwright v. Witt (1985)\n469 U.S. 412, 424; see Witherspoon v. Illinois (1968) 391 U.S. 510.) Under this\nstandard, a prospective juror is properly excluded in a capital case if he or she is unable to\nfollow the trial court‘s instruction and ―conscientiously consider all of the sentencing\nalternatives, including the death penalty where appropriate.‖ (People v. McWhorter\n(2009) 47 Cal.4th 318, 340; see People v. Jenkins (2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 987 (Jenkins).)\n\n\n                                              53\n\f       A trial court‘s ruling on a challenge for cause based solely on a juror‘s responses\non a written questionnaire is subject to de novo review by this court. (People v. Avila\n(2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 529 (Avila).) We review the record to determine whether the trial\ncourt had sufficient information regarding Prospective Juror G.P.‘s state of mind to\npermit it to reliably determine whether his views on the death penalty would prevent or\nsubstantially impair the performance of his duties in this case. (Stewart, supra, 33\nCal.4th at p. 445; see also Avila, at p. 531 [―a prospective juror in a capital case may be\ndischarged for cause based solely on his or her answers to the written questionnaire if it is\nclear from the answers that he or she is unwilling to temporarily set aside his or her own\nbeliefs and follow the law‖].)\n       In Cook, supra, 40 Cal.4th at pages 1343–1344, and Avila, supra, 38 Cal.4th at\npage 532, we upheld the trial court‘s orders excusing prospective jurors whose\nquestionnaire answers showed they could not impose the death penalty even though they\nalso responded they could set aside their personal feelings and follow the law. The\nsituation before us presents a similar dichotomy.\n       In his questionnaire, Prospective Juror G.P. stated he had strong religious beliefs\nthat made it difficult for him to judge someone else because he was taught God is the\nonly rightful judge, and although he had no problem judging another person on the issue\nof guilt, he had a problem with deciding the appropriate punishment. Significantly, G.P.\nstated unequivocally he was strongly opposed to the death penalty, which he saw as\neconomically motivated and as part of a system that had ―lost all hope,‖ and he could not\nthink of a single crime deserving the death penalty. Although G.P. stated it was a\n―possibility‖ he could choose the death penalty in an appropriate case, the example he\ngave was a case in which the defendant was competent and requested it. However, in\nanother response, G.P. implied he would not make up his mind on punishment until he\nheard the case.\n\n\n                                             54\n\f       We conclude Prospective Juror G.P.‘s strong religious beliefs and opposition to\ncapital punishment amply support the conclusion he would have been prevented or\nsubstantially impaired from performing his duties in this particular case. His express\nreluctance to sit in judgment of someone on the issue of punishment made him\nparticularly unqualified to serve on defendant‘s jury, as G.P. was being considered for\nservice on a penalty phase jury that would only be deciding the appropriate punishment\nfor defendant. Although stating somewhat ambiguously he would have to hear the case\nfirst to know whether he could realistically impose either death or life without the\npossibility of parole, G.P. repeatedly expressed his opposition to the death penalty for all\ncrimes, with a possible exception for a case in which a competent defendant exercised his\nright to a jury trial in order to request to be executed. The trial court therefore did not err\nby excusing Prospective Juror G.P. for cause based on his responses to the jury\nquestionnaire.\n\n              c) Prosecutor’s use of peremptory challenges to strike African-American\n                 jurors\n       Defendant claims the prosecutor improperly exercised four of his six peremptory\nchallenges against African-Americans—Prospective Jurors D.W., A.L., S.A.-M., and\nA.C.—during penalty phase jury selection. (See Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79;\nPeople v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d. 258 (Wheeler).) He argues the trial court erred in\nfailing to find a prima facie case of discrimination based on the four challenges and\nabdicated its duty to conduct a sincere evaluation of the prosecutor‘s reasons for excusing\nthose potential jurors. Their improper removal, he contends, requires automatic reversal\nof the judgment.\n       This claim fails for several reasons. First, defendant failed to make a sufficient\nrecord demonstrating Prospective Juror A.L. was a member of a cognizable class.\nSecond, defendant forfeited any Batson/Wheeler claim regarding Prospective Jurors S.A.-\nM. and A.C. by failing to object to their excusal prior to the swearing of the jury and\n\n                                              55\n\falternates. Finally, as to Prospective Juror D.W., the trial court correctly ruled defendant\nfailed to make a prima facie showing the prosecutor excused the juror for reasons of race.\n\n                 (1) Background\n       After the prosecutor exercised his first peremptory challenge against a non-\nAfrican-American juror, defense counsel made a premature Batson/Wheeler motion. He\nargued prospectively that if the prosecutor were to exercise a peremptory challenge\nagainst any African-American jurors, a prima facie case of discrimination would be\nestablished because (1) of the prosecutor‘s six for-cause challenges denied by the court,\n―approximately [50] percent of those persons were [B]lack,‖ and (2) the prosecutor had\ndevoted an inordinate amount of time—approximately 75 to 80 percent of the voir dire\ntranscript pages—questioning African-American jurors.11 The prosecutor objected to\nwhat he considered defense counsel‘s attempts to intimidate him in his exercise of\nperemptory challenges. After additional discussion, the court found, considering the\nexplanations offered for the prosecutor‘s challenges for cause to minority and non-\nminority jurors, there had been no attempt to systematically exclude minority jurors.\n       After voir dire continued, the prosecutor exercised his second peremptory\nchallenge against Prospective Juror D.W. Defense counsel objected: ―Batson challenge.\nShe‘s a correctional officer. She was one he picked on for no good reason just to ask a\nlot of questions.‖ The trial court denied the challenge, concluding defendant had not\nmade a prima facie showing of a systematic pattern of exclusion of minority jurors. It\ninvited the prosecutor to place his reasons for exercising the challenge on the record,\nnoting, however, he was under no obligation to do so. The prosecutor declined the\ninvitation, stating he would provide an explanation for each minority juror for whom he\n\n\n\n11     Defense counsel did not restrict his Batson/Wheeler objections to African-\nAmericans or other racial groups. He also filed a written Batson/Wheeler motion arguing\nthat Vietnam veterans were a cognizable class.\n                                             56\n\fexercised a peremptory challenge at the end of jury selection. The court thereafter\nexcused D.W.\n       The prosecutor exercised his third peremptory challenge against Prospective Juror\nA.L. Defense counsel objected: ―Batson again.‖ The court excused A.L. without\nexplicitly ruling on defendant‘s challenge.\n       The prosecutor exercised his fourth peremptory challenge against Prospective\nJuror S.A.-M. Defense counsel stated: ―I‘ll wait till he does one more, then I‘ll do that.\nI‘m going to make a motion. So we don‘t have to argue it each time.‖ The trial court\nresponded: ―All right. For the record, the court notes that there was a challenge for\ncause as to [S.A.-M.] and she did indicate an attitude that was definitely leaning against\nthe death penalty, although probably not sufficient, the court found, to grant a challenge\nfor cause. But certainly it‘s a basis for an exercise of the peremptory challenge.‖\n       The prosecutor exercised his fifth challenge against Prospective Juror A.C.\nDefense counsel made no objection, and the trial court excused A.C. Subsequently, the\nparties accepted 12 jurors after the prosecutor exercised his sixth and final peremptory\nchallenge without any further Batson/Wheeler objections. During the selection of the\nalternate jurors, the defendant made no Batson/Wheeler objections. Thereafter, six\nalternate jurors were chosen.\n       After the jurors and alternate jurors were sworn, the prosecutor asked whether\nthere was a Batson/Wheeler motion still pending. The trial court and defense counsel\nindicated it had been denied, referring to the colloquy that occurred in connection with\nProspective Juror D.W. The prosecutor, defense counsel, and the court all noted the\nprosecution thereafter had exercised peremptory challenges against two other African-\nAmerican prospective jurors, S.A.-M. and A.C. Defense counsel then stated, ―I don‘t\nbelieve I said anything when he did that. The court confirmed, ―Correct. You didn‘t\nrenew or make another motion.‖ Defense counsel affirmed, ―I had made the motion.\n\n\n                                              57\n\fYou had denied it. And I guess the reasons for my not doing it again will have to go with\nme to the federal habeas or whatever.‖\n       The prosecutor then asked for the opportunity to ―go on the record‖ regarding the\nthree challenges. The trial court granted this request, but first stated: ―[E]ven after the\ntwo additional challenges[,] the Court is still satisfied that there is not a . . . prima facie\ndemonstration to the Court of any systematic or attempted systematic exclusion of\n[B]lack jurors by the prosecution, particularly with regard to the last two peremptories of\n[B]lack jurors. [¶] The responses in the questionnaire, and the responses of the jurors\norally, in the Court‘s view, provided adequate non-racial basis for the peremptory\nchallenges. And if the motion had been renewed, it would have been denied again at that\npoint, again on the basis that there was not a prima facie showing. [¶] [The c]ourt will\nalso note that the jury that the prosecution passed on that was actually sworn does include\ntwo [B]lack jurors. Which is, again, additional evidence to the Court that there was not\nan attempt to systematically exclude [B]lacks.‖12\n       Thereafter, the prosecutor explained he excused Prospective Juror D.W. because\nshe was argumentative during voir dire and had used defensive body language. D.W.\nalso linked her job as a prison guard with the possibility of becoming a psychologist who\ncounseled inmates, which was problematic from the prosecutor‘s perspective because\ndefendant‘s penalty phase specifically involved psychological and psychiatric testimony.\nD.W. further described herself as being ―on the opposite end of the spectrum‖ of\nProspective Juror D.P.,13 which indicated to the prosecutor D.W. would tend to always\n\n12     In allowing the prosecutor to make a record of his race-neutral reasons for\nexcusing the jurors in question, even though finding no prima facie case of\ndiscrimination, the trial court followed the ―better practice.‖ (People v. Bonilla (2007) 41\nCal.4th 313, 343, fn.13 (Bonilla) [noting that such information assists the reviewing court\nin assessing the ruling on appeal].)\n\n13    During voir dire, Prospective Juror D.P. had expressed negative views about\n―counselors, therapists, whatever you want to call them, psychologists, psychiatrists,‖ as\n                                               58\n\fbelieve such testimony. And when the prosecutor asked D.W. about rolling her eyes\nwhile D.P. was speaking during voir dire, D.W. at first admitted to doing so, but then\nlater approached the prosecutor during a break, in violation of a court order not to discuss\nthe case, and told him she was just batting her eyes rather than rolling them. This\nbehavior, coupled with animosity in D.W.‘s voice, concerned the prosecutor.\n       With respect to Prospective Juror A.C., the prosecutor first noted she failed to\nwrite responses to many of the questions regarding her views on the death penalty. She\nfurther expressed ―severe‖ reservations about the death penalty during voir dire and was\n―dishonest‖ in recounting she had heard on the news about a recent execution in\nCalifornia, which never occurred.\n       Finally, concerning Prospective Juror S.A.-M., the prosecutor explained he\nexcused her due to her ―serious reservations about the use of the death penalty.‖\nResponses in the juror questionnaire indicated her religious beliefs taught her not to judge\nothers and she would not consider imposing the death penalty on a combat veteran. She\nalso had a relative who was killed by a deputy sheriff in Los Angeles and her family\nwanted criminal charges brought against the sheriff‘s department. This potential bias\nagainst law enforcement concerned the prosecutor as well. And despite S.A.-M.‘s\nrecognition there were ―probably circumstances where the death penalty could be\nimposed,‖ she wrote she hoped never to be part of such a decision. Such reservations\nabout the death penalty, which were further developed during voir dire, led the prosecutor\nto believe S.A.-M. would not be an appropriate juror for defendant‘s case.\n       Defense counsel did not respond to or comment on the explanations volunteered\nby the prosecutor. Having denied defendant‘s Batson/Wheeler motion regarding\n\nwell as skepticism about two psychological experts evaluating someone over a short time\nand suddenly claiming to know ―what was wrong with this person.‖ D.P. also stated an\nexpert‘s credentials ―doesn‘t mean squat‖ if they have only spent a few hours, days, or\nweeks talking with the person they are evaluating. D.P. further admitted she was\n―opinionated.‖\n                                            59\n\fProspective Juror D.W. for failure to make a prima facie showing of discrimination, the\ntrial court did not evaluate or otherwise render any further ruling on the prosecutor‘s\nexplanations, merely stating ―all right‖ and then calling a recess.\n\n                 (2) Analysis\n                     (a) Prospective Juror A.L.\n       Respondent argues defendant forfeited any claim of error with respect to\nProspective Juror A.L. by failing to articulate a clear Batson/Wheeler objection. (See\nPeople v. Lewis (2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 481.) In objecting to the prosecutor‘s peremptory\nchallenge of A.L., defense counsel simply stated ―Batson again.‖ Although defendant\nassumes on appeal that A.L. was one of four African-American prospective jurors against\nwhom the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges, the record fails to disclose what\ncognizable class defendant was asserting as the basis for his Batson/Wheeler objection to\nthe peremptory challenge of A.L.\n       It is true, as defendant notes in his reply, his first Batson/Wheeler objection\nconcerned an African-American prospective juror, D.W. But defendant did not provide\nany factual basis for the objection regarding A.L. or make any record as to what\ncognizable class A.L. allegedly belonged to. A.L. was never identified as African-\nAmerican during voir dire, and in fact self-identified as ―Caucasian,‖ ―Danish,‖ and\n―Dane‖ in his jury questionnaire. Nor was A.L. identified as African-American in any of\nthe Batson/Wheeler discussions contained in the record. To the contrary, in their\ndiscussion following the swearing of the jury, the court, defense counsel, and the\nprosecutor all stated that there had been three African-American prospective jurors\nexcused by the prosecution and identified those three jurors as D.W., S.A-M., and A.C.\nDefense counsel, moreover, did not restrict his Batson/Wheeler motions to racial groups;\nhe also attempted to argue that Vietnam veterans were a cognizable class. The failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                             60\n\fclearly articulate the Batson/Wheeler objection to the peremptory challenge against A.L.\nforfeited the issue for appeal.\n                      (b) Prospective Jurors S.A.-M. and A.C.\n       Respondent contends defendant also forfeited a claim of Batson/Wheeler error\nwith respect to Prospective Jurors S.A.-M. and A.C. by failing to make a Batson/Wheeler\nobjection. In order to preserve a Batson/Wheeler claim based on the prosecutor‘s\nperemptory challenges, the defendant must make a timely objection. (People v.\nMcDermott (2002) 28 Cal.4th 946, 969.) To be timely, a Batson/Wheeler objection must\nbe made before the jury is sworn. (See People v. Howard (1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1154;\nPeople v. Thompson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 134, 179.)\n       When the prosecutor exercised his fourth peremptory challenge against S.A.-M.,\nan African-American prospective juror, defense counsel indicated he was ―going to make\na motion,‖ but would wait until the prosecutor ―does one more.‖ However, he did not\nobject when the prosecutor exercised his next peremptory challenge against A.C., another\nAfrican-American prospective juror, nor did he make a motion before the jurors and\nalternates were sworn in and the venire excused. After the jurors and alternate jurors\nwere sworn and the prosecutor asked whether there was a Batson/Wheeler motion still\npending, defense counsel agreed with the trial court he had not renewed or made new\nBatson/Wheeler motions with respect to S.A.-M. and A.C., stating: ―I guess the reasons\nfor my not doing it again will have to go with me to the federal habeas or whatever.‖\n(Italics added.) Defense counsel also did not discuss or contest the prosecutor‘s\nvolunteered explanations for the two challenges. In light of the lack of a timely, or even\nuntimely, objection, any claim of Batson/Wheeler error regarding Prospective Jurors\nS.A.-M. and A.C. was forfeited.\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\f                      (c) Prospective Juror D.W.\n       Defendant did make a timely, clearly articulated Batson/Wheeler objection with\nrespect to the prosecutor‘s peremptory challenge against Prospective Juror D.W. The\napplicable law is well settled. While a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise\nperemptory challenges for almost any reason at all, ―[b]oth the state and federal\nConstitutions prohibit the use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors\nbased on race . . . .‖ (Bonilla, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 341.)\n       A three-stage procedure applies to the evaluation of Batson/Wheeler motions.\n―First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case ‗by showing that the totality of the\nrelevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.‘ [Citations.] Second,\nonce the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the ‗burden shifts to the State to\nexplain adequately the racial exclusion‘ by offering permissible race-neutral justifications\nfor the strikes. [Citations.] Third, ‗[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial\ncourt must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful\nracial discrimination.‘ ‖ (Johnson v. California (2005) 545 U.S. 162, 168, fn. omitted.)\n       This subclaim involves only the first of these three stages—whether defendant\nmade out a prima facie case of racial discrimination. Although the prosecutor\nsubsequently volunteered his reasons for challenging D.W., ―the trial court did not\nevaluate the prosecutor‘s stated reasons, either explicitly or implicitly.‖ (People v.\nSattiewhite (2014) 59 Cal.4th 446, 469.) Rather, the court expressly ruled defendant had\nnot made a prima facie case before the prosecution‘s recitation of reasons and denied the\nBatson/Wheeler motion on this basis. The trial court merely allowed the prosecution ―to\npreserve for the record its reason for those excusals.‖\n       Nevertheless, in finding defendant failed to make a prima facie case of racial\ndiscrimination, the trial court appears to have used an incorrect standard, finding ―no\nsystematic pattern of exclusion,‖ rather than no inference of discriminatory purpose.\n(See, e.g., Avila, supra, 38 Cal.4th at pp. 554–555 [trial court was under the mistaken\n\n                                              62\n\fimpression that only pattern of discrimination through multiple excusals could make\nprima facie showing].) We therefore independently review the record to ― ‗resolve the\nlegal question whether the record supports an inference that the prosecutor excused a\njuror on the basis of race.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 554.)\n       Certain types of evidence are relevant in determining whether a defendant has\ncarried his burden of showing an inference of discriminatory excusal, such as whether the\nprosecutor ―struck most or all of the members of the identified group from the venire or\nused a disproportionate number of his peremptories against the group,‖ whether the\nexcused jurors had little in common other than their membership in the group, and\nwhether the prosecutor engaged in ―desultory voir dire‖ or no questioning at all.\n(Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at pp. 280–281.) Although a ―defendant need not be a\nmember of the excluded group,‖ it is significant if he is and if, in addition, his victims are\nmembers of the group to which the majority of the remaining jurors belong. (Id. at p.\n281; see People v. Kelly (2007) 42 Cal.4th 763, 779–780.)\n       Defendant argues the prosecutor used a disproportionate number—four of six—of\nhis peremptory challenges to excuse African-Americans from the jury pool. The record\ndoes not support defendant‘s claim. In selecting a jury for the penalty phase, the\nprosecutor exercised a total of eight peremptory challenges to potential jurors—six\nduring the selection of the 12 jurors and two during the selection of the six alternate\njurors—only three of which were used to remove African-Americans D.W., S.A.-M., and\nA.C. As noted, the record does not support defendant‘s contention that Prospective Juror\nA.L. was African-American.\n       The prosecutor, moreover, passed two African-American prospective jurors who\nultimately were seated on the jury. (People v. Clark (2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 906\n[―Although the circumstance that the jury included a member of the identified group is\nnot dispositive [citation], ‗it is an indication of good faith in exercising peremptories . . .‘\nand an appropriate factor to consider in assessing a [Batson/Wheeler] motion.‖].) The\n                                                  63\n\fprosecutor‘s use of three of eight (or 38 percent) of his peremptory challenges to excuse\nAfrican-American prospective jurors, particularly where the other two African-American\nprospective jurors were passed and seated on the jury, ―does not support an inference of\nbias.‖ (People v. Cornwell (2005) 37 Cal.4th 50, 70.)\n       Moreover, the prosecutor engaged in more than a desultory voir dire of\nProspective Juror D.W. Indeed, defendant complains that no juror was publicly\nquestioned by the prosecution ―more relentlessly‖ than D.W. However, the thoroughness\nof the prosecutor‘s probing of D.W. was not outside the norm and does not support an\ninference of racial bias.\n       We discern at least one race-neutral reason for excusing Prospective Juror D.W.\nthat is ―apparent from and ‗clearly established‘ in the record.‖ (People v. Scott (June 8,\n2015, S064858) __ Cal.4th __ [at p. 20].) The defense case for the penalty phase would\nrely heavily on psychological testimony concerning PTSD resulting from defendant‘s\nabusive childhood and experiences in Vietnam. Not only did D.W. express a strong\nreceptivity toward such testimony, stating such experts ―would be necessary,‖ she also\nindicated she wanted to ―lateral over into prison counseling.‖ This was a legitimate race-\nneutral reason for excusing D.W. (See, e.g., Avila, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 556 [a juror\nwho indicated she worked closely with psychologists and psychiatrists as a nurse in a\npsychiatric ward and valued their opinions provided a reason other than racial bias for the\nprosecutor‘s challenge]; People v. Gutierrez (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1083, 1124 [prosecutor‘s\nbelief that the prospective juror would place too much weight on the opinion testimony of\nmental health experts could justify the peremptory challenge].)\n       Based on our independent review of the record of voir dire, we conclude the\ntotality of the relevant facts does not support inferring the prosecutor challenged\nProspective Juror D.W. because of her race. The trial court therefore did not err in\ndenying defendant‘s Batson/Wheeler motion for failure to establish a prima facie case.\n\n\n                                             64\n\f              d) Denial of a continuance prior to jury selection\n       Defendant claims the trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for a\ncontinuance of the penalty phase based on publicity surrounding the April 1995 bombing\nof the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. He contends the denial of this request\ncaused voir dire to be conducted shortly after the bombing in ―an unduly prejudicial\natmosphere‖ and thus violated his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\n       Before the beginning of jury selection in the penalty phase, defendant moved for a\ncontinuance from May until September 1995, arguing there was good cause in light of\n―the difficulty of selecting a fair and impartial jury in this case, due to the interconnection\nof some of the major issues in [defendant‘s] life, and of those persons accused of the\nbombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.‖ He pointed to the circumstance that\nTimothy McVeigh, one of the Oklahoma City bombing suspects, was an army veteran\nwho might also raise a PTSD defense. Defendant also argued future delays might occur\nbecause one of the defense experts was working with trauma victims in Oklahoma City.\nThe trial court, noting among other circumstances that McVeigh had fought in the Gulf\nWar while defendant was a Vietnam War veteran, found no similarities between\ndefendant‘s case and the Oklahoma City bombing. Concluding the events in Oklahoma\nwould have no significant impact on jury selection in this case, the trial court denied\ndefendant‘s request for a continuance.\n       A continuance may be granted only on the moving party‘s showing of good cause.\n(§ 1050, subd. (e).) ―The granting or denial of a motion for continuance rests within the\nsound discretion of the trial court.‖ (People v. Mickey (1991) 54 Cal.3d 612, 660.) In\nlight of the lack of any relationship or similarity between the Oklahoma City bombing\nand defendant‘s case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding there was no\nshowing of good cause for a continuance.\n       The publicity from the Oklahoma City bombing, which differed drastically from\nthe SOS murders in both kind and degree, had no bearing on defendant‘s case. Timothy\n\n                                              65\n\fMcVeigh detonated a 3,000- to 6,000-pound bomb, killing 168 people, including 19\nchildren and eight law enforcement officials. (U. S. v. McVeigh (10th Cir. 1998) 153\nF.3d 1166, 1177.) By comparison, defendant shot and killed three adult victims with\nwhom he was acquainted during the commission of a burglary and robbery of a company\nfor which he once worked. The Oklahoma City bombing was politically motivated with\nthe goal of inciting a general uprising against the government (ibid.), whereas defendant‘s\nmurders were financially motivated. The only concrete common feature argued by\ndefense counsel, that defendant and McVeigh were both Army veterans, does not\nwithstand scrutiny. McVeigh was not a veteran of the Vietnam War, and defendant‘s\njury would hear defense testimony that the Vietnam conflict had many significant\ncharacteristics not present in other conflicts and that generated unique problems for\nVietnam War veterans.\n       Not only were the supposed connections between the cases tenuous at best, the\npossibility of an unavailable witness and the notion that a separate tragedy would have a\nprejudicial effect on a jury trying this case were pure speculation. Moreover, voir dire\nexists exactly to explore issues of prejudice such as these. In sum, the court‘s ruling\nclearly was not manifestly erroneous or arbitrary.\n\n          2. Failure to sua sponte appoint a second attorney\n       Defendant contends the trial court violated his rights under the Sixth and Eighth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California\nConstitution by failing to appoint, sua sponte, a second qualified attorney to assist\ndefense counsel in his case. As defendant acknowledges, ― ‗[t]he appointment of a\nsecond counsel in a capital case is not an absolute right protected by either the state or the\nfederal Constitution.‘ ‖ (People v. Williams (2006) 40 Cal.4th 287, 300.) It is true that\nby statute, California trial courts have the authority to appoint a second attorney to\nrepresent a capital defendant. (§ 987, subd. (d).) However, no sua sponte duty to appoint\n\n\n                                             66\n\fadditional counsel can be derived from a statutory provision granting only discretionary\nauthority to the trial court to do so upon a written request and supporting affidavit by\nprimary counsel. ―Indeed, under the statute, the trial court lacks any specific authority to\nappoint a second attorney in the absence of a request from the first attorney and the\nmaking of a factual record sufficient to support such an appointment. To the extent that\ndefendant‘s argument is that the trial courts have inherent power to appoint a second\nattorney, no authority supporting that proposition is cited.‖ (People v. Padilla (1995) 11\nCal.4th 891, 928.) Accordingly, defendant‘s claim that the court erred in not appointing a\nsecond attorney in the absence of such a request fails.\n\n          3. Admission of photographic and videotape crime scene evidence\n       Defendant claims five photographs of the victims previously admitted in the guilt\nphase, as well as a silent videotape of the crime scene, should have been excluded in the\npenalty phase as irrelevant (see Evid. Code, § 350) and more prejudicial than probative\n(see id., § 352). The photographs depicted the victims‘ bodies as they were found on the\nfloor in the restroom, with close-ups of their bound hands. The video depicted the\nfreeway next to SOS and the SOS parking lot, and a forensic expert walking around the\nbuilding, hallways, and warehouse filming the register on the office desk, the lobby, and\na ceiling-to-floor view of the interior of the women‘s bathroom, including the victims‘\nbodies and at least one bullet casing. Defendant argues the failure to exclude these\nexhibits denied him due process of law under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution and article I, sections 7, 15, 17 and 24 of\nthe California Constitution.\n       As a preliminary matter, defendant has forfeited any claim that three of the five\ncrime scene photographs were erroneously admitted. Although defendant moved to\nexclude five photographs and argued his objection at the hearing, at the time the trial\ncourt formally admitted the challenged evidence defense counsel withdrew his objection\n\n\n                                             67\n\fto one of the photographs and affirmatively stipulated to the admission of two others.\n(See, e.g., People v. Cook (2006) 39 Cal.4th 566, 609.)\n        With respect to the remaining two photographs and the 30-second portion of the\ncrime scene videotape depicting the victims in the bathroom, the trial court did not abuse\nits discretion by admitting this evidence. ― ‗A trial court‘s decision to admit photographs\nunder Evidence Code section 352 will be upheld on appeal unless the prejudicial effect of\nsuch photographs clearly outweighs their probative value.‘ [Citations.] Notably,\nhowever, the discretion to exclude photographs under Evidence Code section 352 is\nmuch narrower at the penalty phase than at the guilt phase. This is so because the\nprosecution has the right to establish the circumstances of the crime, including its\ngruesome consequences [citation], and because the risk of an improper guilt finding\nbased on visceral reactions is no longer present.‖ (Bonilla, supra, 41 Cal.4th at pp. 353–\n354.)\n        The two crime scene photographs and videotape were relevant to the penalty phase\nof the trial. They show the circumstances of the crime, which included premeditation and\ndeliberation on defendant‘s part as evidenced by his binding the victims‘ hands behind\ntheir backs with duct tape he had bought a week or two before committing the crimes.\nThey further corroborated defendant‘s custodial statements to law enforcement officers,\nincluding that he had shot Smith several more times upon discovering he had broken free\nfrom his bindings (one of the photographs and the videotape depicts broken strands of\nduct tape on Smith‘s wrists). Finally, as in the guilt phase, the forensic pathologist used\nthe photographs to assist the trier of fact in understanding her testimony. The admitted\nphotographs and videotape also were not cumulative; only five photographs and 30\nseconds of videotape were admitted.\n        Nor were the photographs or videotape substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative. ―As we have previously noted, ‗ ―murder is seldom pretty, and pictures,\ntestimony and physical evidence in such a case are always unpleasant.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v.\n                                             68\n\fRoldan (2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 713.) Likewise in this case. But as unpleasant as these\nphotographs and videotape may be, they demonstrate the real-life consequences of\ndefendant‘s actions. The prosecution was entitled to have the penalty phase jury consider\nthose consequences. The trial court‘s exercise of discretion to admit them was neither\nstatutory nor constitutional error.\n\n           4. Denial of automatic application for modification of death verdict\n       Defendant claims the trial court erred in denying his automatic application for\nmodification of the death verdict pursuant to section 190.4, subdivision (e). This claim,\namounting to no more than a disagreement with the trial court‘s assessment of the\nevidence, lacks merit.\n       Section 190.4, subdivision (e), provides for an automatic application for\nmodification of a finding or verdict imposing death in every case in which the jury has\nreturned such a finding or verdict. ―Pursuant to section 190.4, in ruling upon an\napplication for modification of a verdict imposing the death penalty, the trial court must\nreweigh independently the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and\nthen determine whether, in its independent judgment, the weight of the evidence supports\nthe jury‘s verdict.‖ (Crittenden, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 150.) The statute thus requires the\ncourt to make an independent determination concerning the propriety of the death\npenalty. The court must state the reasons for its ruling on the record, but need not\ndescribe every detail supporting its ruling so long as the statement of reasons is sufficient\nto allow meaningful appellate review. (People v. Lewis and Oliver (2006) 39 Cal.4th\n970, 1064.)\n       ―On appeal, we independently review the trial court‘s ruling after reviewing the\nrecord, but we do not determine the penalty de novo.‖ (People v. Steele (2002) 27\nCal.4th 1230, 1267 (Steele).) Where the record shows the trial court properly performed\nits duty under section 190.4, subdivision (e), to conduct an independent reweighing of the\n\n\n                                             69\n\faggravating and mitigating evidence, the court‘s ruling will be upheld. (People v. Abilez\n(2007) 41 Cal.4th 472, 530 (Abilez).)\n       Here, the trial court expressly recognized its duty to independently review and\nreweigh the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine whether\nthe sentence imposed was proportionate to defendant‘s culpability. It reviewed in detail\nthe aggravating and mitigating factors listed in section 190.3. For example, it considered\nin aggravation the circumstances of the crime, including the ―high-degree of cold-\nblooded callousness‖ exhibited by the killings, defendant‘s prior felony convictions,\nincluding the extent to which they involved attempted use of force or violence and\nimplied threats thereof, and defendant‘s maturity and life experiences at the time of the\ncrimes, including his prior prison and parole terms. In mitigation, it considered the lack\nof more numerous acts of violence by defendant in light of his mature age, defendant‘s\ntraumatic childhood, including the physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and\nabandonment he experienced, his decorated service to the country and traumatic war\nexperiences in Vietnam, and the testimony of defendant‘s experts concerning PTSD both\ngenerally and as related to defendant. It ultimately found the weight of the mitigating\ncircumstances had been ―greatly attenuated‖ by the intervening 20 years between\ndefendant‘s service in Vietnam and the SOS crimes, as well as defendant‘s criminal\nconvictions and acts of violence that culminated in the present offenses. The court then\nstated its independent judgment that the circumstances in aggravation outweighed the\ncircumstances in mitigation and the substantial weight of the evidence supported the\njury‘s verdict of death.\n       Defendant essentially argues the trial court erred because it failed to find his\nchildhood problems, Vietnam experiences, and mental health issues to be as significant or\nweighty as it should have. As is apparent, however, ―the trial court applied the correct\nstandard and properly conducted an independent reweighing of the aggravating and\nmitigating evidence. That it did not find defendant‘s proffered mitigating evidence as\n                                             70\n\fpersuasive as he would have liked does not undermine this conclusion.‖ (Abilez, supra,\n41 Cal.4th at p. 530; see Steele, supra, 27 Cal.4th at pp. 1267–1268.) The court‘s refusal\nto modify the verdict is consistent with both the law and the evidence. We therefore\nconclude the trial court properly performed its duty under section 190.4, subdivision (e).\n\n          5. Penalty of death as disproportionate to defendant’s individual\n             culpability\n       Defendant claims his death sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of the state and federal Constitutions because the penalty is grossly\ndisproportionate to his individual culpability in committing the crimes. ― ‗To determine\nwhether a sentence is cruel or unusual as applied to a particular defendant, a reviewing\ncourt must examine the circumstances of the offense, including its motive, the extent of\nthe defendant‘s involvement in the crime, the manner in which the crime was committed,\nand the consequences of the defendant‘s acts. The court must also consider the personal\ncharacteristics of the defendant, including age, prior criminality, and mental capabilities.\n[Citation.] If the court concludes that the penalty imposed is ―grossly disproportionate to\nthe defendant‘s individual culpability‖ [citation], or, stated another way, that the\npunishment ― ‗ ―shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human\ndignity‖ ‘ ‖ [citation], the court must invalidate the sentence as unconstitutional.‘ ‖\n(Steele, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1269.)\n       Defendant received a death sentence for three burglary and robbery murders\ncommitted by him alone, purely for financial gain. Although the three victims\ncooperated fully with defendant‘s demands and offered no resistance, he nevertheless\nshot and killed them one by one. He also had an extensive prior criminal record\nincluding prior prison and jail terms. Defendant attempts to mitigate his personal\nculpability by citing his traumatic childhood and Vietnam War experiences and resulting\nPTSD. We agree with the trial court that these circumstances ultimately did not affect\ndefendant‘s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his\n\n                                             71\n\fconduct to the requirements of the law. Defendant‘s actions at the time of the murders\nshowed a rational, logical, intelligent, and calculated thought process, and his efforts to\ndestroy evidence and to avoid capture by fleeing across the country amply demonstrate\nhis awareness of the wrongfulness of his actions.\n       In light of the evidence and relevant considerations, we conclude defendant‘s\nsentence is not disproportionate to his personal culpability, nor does it shock the\nconscience.\n\n       C. Challenges to California’s Death Penalty Scheme\n       Defendant raises a number of challenges to the constitutionality of California‘s\ndeath penalty scheme, based upon the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments\nof the United States Constitution. As he acknowledges, we have previously considered\nand consistently rejected these contentions in prior cases. Presented with no reasons that\ncompel reconsideration, we adhere to those decisions as follows.\n       Section 190.2 is not impermissibly overbroad. Specifically, the various special\ncircumstances are not so numerous as to fail to perform the constitutionally required\nnarrowing function, and the special circumstances are not unduly broad or expansive,\neither on their face or as interpreted by this court. (E.g., Jenkins, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p.\n1050; see also Brown v. Sanders (2006) 546 U.S. 212, 221 [recognizing that the special\ncircumstances listed in section 190.2 are designed to satisfy the narrowing requirement].)\n       Section 190.3, factor (a), does not, on its face or as interpreted and applied, permit\nthe ― ‗arbitrary and capricious‘ ‖ or ― ‗wanton and freakish‘ ‖ imposition of a sentence of\ndeath. (E.g., People v. Brasure (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1037, 1066; see Tuilaepa v. California\n(1994) 512 U.S. 967, 976 [―The circumstances of the crime are a traditional subject for\nconsideration by the sentencer, and an instruction to consider the circumstances is neither\nvague nor otherwise improper under our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.‖].)\n\n\n\n\n                                              72\n\f       Neither the federal nor the state Constitution requires the penalty phase jury to\nmake unanimous findings concerning the particular aggravating circumstances, find the\ntruth of every fact supporting all aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, or find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors and\ndeath is the appropriate sentence. (E.g., People v. Howard (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1000, 1031;\nPeople v. Fairbank (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1223, 1255.) The United States Supreme Court‘s\ndecisions interpreting the Sixth Amendment‘s jury trial guarantee (see Cunningham v.\nCalifornia (2007) 549 U.S. 270; United States v. Booker (2005) 543 U.S. 220; Blakely v.\nWashington (2004) 542 U.S. 296; Ring v. Arizona (2002) 536 U.S. 584; Apprendi v. New\nJersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466) do not alter these conclusions. (E.g., People v. Bramit\n(2009) 46 Cal.4th 1221, 1250 & fn. 22.)\n       Written or other specific findings by the jury regarding the aggravating factors are\nnot constitutionally required. (E.g., People v. Friend (2009) 47 Cal.4th 1, 90.)\n       Intercase proportionality review is not constitutionally required. (Moon, supra, 37\nCal.4th at p. 48; see Pulley v. Harris (1984) 465 U.S. 37, 50–51.)\n       The use of adjectives such as ―extreme‖ in section 190.3, factors (d) and (g), or\n―substantial‖ in section 190.3, factor (g), do not serve as improper barriers to the\nconsideration of mitigating evidence. (E.g., People v. Cruz (2008) 44 Cal.4th 636, 681.)\n       The trial court was ―not required to instruct the jury as to which of the listed\nsentencing factors are aggravating, which are mitigating, and which could be either‖\nmitigating or aggravating, depending upon the jury‘s appraisal of the evidence. (People\nv. Manriquez (2005) 37 Cal.4th 547, 590, italics added; see People v. Hillhouse (2002) 27\nCal.4th 469, 509 [―The aggravating or mitigating nature of the factors is self-evident\nwithin the context of each case.‖].)\n       Because capital defendants are not similarly situated to noncapital defendants,\nCalifornia‘s death penalty law does not deny capital defendants equal protection by not\n\n\n                                             73\n\fproviding certain procedural protections afforded to noncapital defendants. (E.g., People\nv. Cruz, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 681.)\n       We reject the argument that the use of capital punishment ―as regular punishment‖\nviolates international norms of humanity and decency and hence violates the Eighth\nAmendment of the United States Constitution. ―California does not employ capital\npunishment in such a manner. The death penalty is available only for the crime of first\ndegree murder, and only when a special circumstance is found true; furthermore,\nadministration of the penalty is governed by constitutional and statutory provisions\ndifferent from those applying to ‗regular punishment‘ for felonies.‖ (People v.\nDemetrulias (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1, 43–44.)\n       Lastly, we find no state or federal constitutional violation when the asserted\ndefects in California‘s death penalty scheme are considered collectively. (People v.\nLucero (2000) 23 Cal.4th 692, 741.)\n\n\n\n\n                                            74\n\f                                   DISPOSITION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed in its entirety.\n\n\n                                               WERDEGAR, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

Ct. No. RCR 22225\n ___________________________________ )\n\n\n        In a bench trial before the Superior Court of San Bernardino County, defendant\nJohn Lee Cunningham was convicted of the first degree murders of Wayne Sonke, David\nSmith, and Jose Silva. (Pen. Code, §§ 187, subd. (a), 189.1) The trial court found true\nthe special circumstance allegations that defendant committed multiple murders and that\nthe murders of Sonke and Smith took place during the commission of a burglary and a\nrobbery. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3), (17)(A) and 17(G).) The court also found defendant\nguilty of one count of second degree burglary (§ 459), three counts of second degree\nrobbery (§ 211), one count of arson (§ 451, subd. (d)), and one count of possession of a\nfirearm by a felon (former § 12021, subd. (a)). The court further found true various\nsentencing enhancement allegations—that defendant personally used a firearm in the\ncommission of the murders, robberies, and burglary (former § 12022.5, subd. (a)), had\npreviously been convicted of various felonies (§ 667), and had served prior prison terms\nfor felony convictions (§ 667.5).\n\n1       All further statutory references are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise noted.\n\f       A jury was sworn for the penalty phase and returned a verdict of death. After\nconducting an automatic review and declining defendant‘s request to modify the jury‘s\nverdict (§ 190.4, subd. (e)), the trial court sentenced him to death for the three first degree\nmurders with special circumstances, as well as to a determinate term of 16 years for the\nremaining counts and allegations.\n       This appeal is automatic. (§ 1239, subd. (b).) We affirm the judgment in its\nentirety.\n                                         I. FACTS\n\n       A. The Guilt Phase\n       Defendant went to Surplus Office Sales (SOS) in Ontario, California, around\nclosing time on the afternoon of Saturday, June 27, 1992, and robbed the three remaining\nemployees at gunpoint. He then bound the victims, herded them into a bathroom, and\nshot them each at least once in the head. Afterward, he set fire to the building before\nfleeing the scene. He was arrested a month later while on the run from police. Defendant\nsubsequently confessed to the murders, burglary, and robberies, and participated in a\nvideotaped reenactment of the crimes.\n       Waiving his right to a jury, defendant‘s bench trial extended over 10 non-\ncontiguous court days. In addition to the prosecution‘s guilt phase evidence, the trial\ncourt considered the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing and at pretrial\nproceedings concerning defendant‘s motion to suppress his multiple confessions.\n\n            1. The prosecution’s case\n\n               a) The crimes\n       Around 4:00 p.m. on June 27, 1992, members of the Ontario Fire Department\nresponding to a call at SOS found an inactive fire in the office portion of the building and\nthree homicide victims in a hallway bathroom. An autopsy revealed that SOS employee\nJose Silva died from two gunshot wounds to the head, assistant manager David Smith\n\n                                              2\n\fdied from multiple gunshot wounds to the head and neck, and store manager Wayne\nSonke died from a single gunshot wound to the head. More than $1,000 in cash had been\ntaken from the store‘s cash register and petty cash box.\n       Michael Ray, the owner of SOS, had employed defendant in the early and mid-\n1980s at two other businesses. About a month before the murders, Ray returned a phone\ncall from defendant asking about work. Ray had not heard from him for three or four\nyears. Defendant also made unannounced visits to SOS on June 20 and 24, a week and a\nfew days before the murders respectively.\n       About 8:30 p.m. on the evening of the murders, defendant called SOS employee\nEvelyn Eriksen at home to ask how she was. Defendant told her he had been playing\npoker with some friends since about noon that day. Later, defendant took Alana Costello,\nhis girlfriend at the time, to the movies and a motel room. Costello was surprised\nbecause defendant was not steadily employed and had been under ―stress‖ trying to find\nenough money for them to move into a bigger apartment. That evening, defendant was\n―much more close-mouthed‖ than usual and acting ―very stressed, very tense, very\nwrapped up in himself.‖ According to Costello, defendant generally was distant and\nremoved, had difficulty sleeping, and would wake up in the middle of the night from bad\ndreams. He had borrowed her Ruger .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle and modified it by\nsawing off part of the stock and barrel. A few days after the murders, Costello noticed\nthe rifle was missing.\n\n              b) Defendant’s subsequent flight and capture\n       On June 30, defendant called Diana Jamison, a former girlfriend. Jamison told\ndefendant that his parole officer had come to her house looking for him. In a later\ntelephone conversation, defendant told Jamison he was on the run because someone,\nperhaps the Mexican Mafia, was after him. Around the same time, defendant called\nJamison upset and crying, saying ―something very terrible had happened‖ and he wanted\n\n\n                                             3\n\fto come back and ―do the right thing.‖ Jamison told defendant to turn himself in.\nAccording to Jamison, defendant had trouble sleeping; he would often wake up in the\nmiddle of the night in a cold sweat, and mentioned dreams of being tortured by women\nand children from his time in Vietnam. Defendant had tried to seek counseling at a\nveteran‘s center.\n       On July 1, Costello received a telephone call from defendant asking her to join\nhim in Nevada. Meeting up at the Las Vegas airport, the two traveled by car to Atlantic\nCity, New Jersey, then drove southwest through Arkansas before heading north. Along\nthe way, defendant placed an Ohio license plate on the car and registered under false\nnames at motels. He never discussed why he had left California and when Costello\nasked, he did not want to talk about it. After seeing how anxious defendant became when\npolice cars passed them, she concluded that he was running from the law.\n       On July 23, law enforcement officers stopped defendant‘s car in Deadwood, South\nDakota after being advised he was in the region and wanted as a murder suspect.\nDefendant and Costello were both taken into custody and defendant was arrested for\nviolating his parole. Police seized a Ruger .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle, a box\ncontaining 31 cartridges for a .22-caliber long rifle, and a magazine loaded with 10\nrounds of .22-caliber ammunition.\n\n              c) Defendant’s statements to law enforcement officers and videotaped\n                 reenactment of the crimes\n       Over the following two days, Ontario Police Department Detectives Gregory\nNottingham and Pat Ortiz interrogated defendant four times. Each interrogation was\naudiotaped or videotaped. On each occasion, the recording equipment was in plain view.\n       At their first meeting the morning of July 24, after approximately six minutes of\npreliminary introductions and questions, Detective Nottingham read defendant his rights\npursuant to Miranda v. Arizona (1966) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miranda). After defendant\nconfirmed that he understood these rights, Nottingham proceeded to ask defendant about\n\n                                             4\n\fhis relationships with Costello and Jamison, as well as about his military and employment\nbackground and his prior robbery arrest. In discussing these subjects, defendant\nrecounted working for Michael Ray at a facility in Long Beach in 1979 and going to SOS\nin Ontario in early June 1992 to visit Eriksen and to look for a job.\n       Defendant then volunteered, ―I know what you guys are getting at. . . . I also want\nyou to know that the reason why I‘m so calm is because I‘m where I belong. . . . I know\nwhy you‘re here in my dreams and that‘s all.‖ When asked to clarify, defendant replied,\n―You know as well as I do that I committed an armed robbery in Ontario‖ at ―Mike‘s\ncompany.‖ When asked for further clarification, defendant reiterated, ―I committed an\narmed robbery,‖ and asked, ―Should I have somebody here talking for me, is this the way\nit‘s supposed to be done?‖ Detective Nottingham reread defendant his Miranda rights\nand asked if he understood them. Defendant stated, ―I do understand.‖\n       In response to the detectives‘ subsequent questions, defendant gave an\noccasionally rambling account of his activities on June 27, describing how he chose to\nrob SOS, how the robbery, murders, and arson occurred, and his subsequent actions. He\nadmitted entering SOS with the intention to steal money, binding the hands of the three\nvictims with duct tape, returning to the bathroom to shoot them, and then using gasoline\nto set the building on fire. These confessions were interspersed with references to\ndefendant‘s dreams, things he claimed to have done during his military service in\nVietnam, and expressions of relief at being caught.\n       The detectives interrogated defendant two more times the afternoon of July 24,\nand again the following morning. No additional Miranda advisements were given.\nDefendant told the detectives he had altered two military personnel forms found in his car\nbecause he was looking for work and wanted to ―look[] better‖ and ―cover‖ for time\nwhen he had been incarcerated. He also indicated he had ―ripped off a shipment‖ as a\nnarcotics courier and asked at one point to be placed in protective custody. One of the\n\n\n                                             5\n\fdetectives also made references to the victims‘ families, stating that once lawyers got\ninvolved in a case, it would get ―a lot more complicated.‖\n       Between July 27 and July 31, the detectives spoke with prosecutors working on\nthe case and played the interview tapes for them. Because the quality of the tapes was\npoor, the prosecutors suggested a videotaped reenactment at the crime scene and told the\ndetectives that the reenactment should be done before an arrest warrant was filed. On\nJuly 31, Wesley Lewis, a correctional sergeant at Folsom Prison where defendant was\nbeing held on his parole violation, interviewed defendant to determine whether he would\nbe willing to participate in the reenactment. Defendant indicated that he would be\n―happy‖ to cooperate ―if it would get me out of here any sooner or quicker.‖\n       On August 2, defendant conducted a reenactment of the crimes, which two\ndetectives observed and videotaped. Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights before\nstarting the reenactment, and affirmed that he understood these rights and wished to talk\nto law enforcement officers.\n       In the video, defendant described how on the day of the murders he first went to\nSOS shortly after noon and stayed for about a half-hour talking with the three victims.\nHe then left and returned after 3:00 p.m. ―to take all the money . . . so I could leave the\nstate.‖ He reentered SOS with the shortened .22-caliber rifle concealed in a paper bag.\nAt gunpoint, defendant ordered the three victims to follow him through the hallway to the\nfront lobby, where he forced Sonke to give him the money from the cash register.\n       When defendant asked Sonke where the rest of the money was, Sonke indicated it\nwas in an office down the hall. Defendant made all the victims go with him to that\nlocation and Sonke opened a filing cabinet with some keys, but did not remove anything.\nDefendant took the keys and made the victims enter the women‘s bathroom, where he\ntold them to lie down on the floor and be quiet. He left all three victims with their hands\nbound behind them with heavy duty tape he had purchased weeks before, but also\nclaimed he had only planned the robbery earlier that day when he decided to return to\n                                              6\n\fSOS. Defendant then took the money from the cash drawer in the filing cabinet, returned\nto the bathroom, and shot the three men.\n       Retrieving a can of gasoline from his car, defendant went back inside to set fire to\nthe building. When he reentered the bathroom, Silva and Sonke were not moving but\nSmith was attempting to break loose of his bonds. Defendant shot Smith again, poured\ngasoline along the hallway, and ignited it with a match. He then removed a key from\ninside the front door and exited, locking the door from the outside. He drove to a\nfreeway overpass to watch the building for a minute or so until a fire truck arrived.\n\n          2. The defense case\n       In his opening argument during the guilt phase, defense counsel described\ndefendant‘s experiences in Vietnam, stating that because of posttraumatic stress disorder,\nthere were periods in his life when defendant ―lost time.‖ With respect to the murders,\ncounsel claimed these were not crimes defendant wanted to commit, and that the only\nway law enforcement officers were able to connect defendant to them was by virtue of\ndefendant‘s cooperation. Counsel cross-examined prosecution witnesses, but presented\nno guilt phase witnesses or other evidence on defendant‘s behalf.\n       During closing argument, counsel contended defendant committed the charged\noffenses because he was experiencing a buildup of pressure caused by a mix of\nhelplessness and fear. In conclusion, counsel argued, ―from everything we know John\nCunningham wished to take responsibility for this particular crime, and he did.‖\n\n       B. The Penalty Phase\n       Defendant‘s requests to absent himself from the penalty phase were denied. A\njury was selected and heard evidence for 34 court days over the course of five months.\nThe prosecution presented testimony relating to the circumstances surrounding the\ncrimes, the effect of the murders on those connected to the victims, and defendant‘s prior\nfelony convictions. Defendant presented extensive testimony to document his abusive\n\n\n                                             7\n\fchildhood, his traumatic combat experiences in Vietnam, and the effects of posttraumatic\nstress disorder on Vietnam-era veterans. He also presented testimony that attempted to\ndiscredit some of the prior crimes evidence.\n\n          1. The prosecution’s case in aggravation\n\n              a) The circumstances surrounding the murders\n       The prosecution presented the testimony of many of the same witnesses who\ntestified during the preliminary hearing and the bench trial to demonstrate the\ncircumstances surrounding the burglary, robberies, murders, and arson. Also presented\nwere the videotapes and transcripts of defendant‘s July 1992 interviews and August 1992\nreenactment and stipulations regarding the collection of crime scene evidence.\n\n              b) Prior crimes\n       On April 24, 1976, Herta Gill was a cashier at the Vineland Drive-In in the City of\nIndustry, California, when at about 9:00 p.m., defendant robbed her at gunpoint of all the\nmoney in her register. He was apprehended a short time later while in possession of a\nfirearm and the stolen cash. After pleading guilty to felony robbery and admitting to\npersonally using a handgun, defendant was sentenced to one year in county jail and then\nplaced on probation.\n       On April 5, 1982, Michelle I. was 14 years old and alone at her home in La\nMirada, California, when defendant sexually assaulted her. Defendant, then a family\nfriend, entered the home on the pretense his car had broken down, but after appearing to\nuse the phone asked Michelle to give him a ―blow job.‖ When she refused, defendant\nforced her onto her knees. When she began screaming, defendant struck her in the face\nwith a closed fist, threatened further physical violence if she continued to scream, and\ndragged her by the hair to the sofa, where he forced her to perform oral sex on him for\napproximately 10 minutes. Before leaving, defendant said he had killed his ex-wife and\nher lover and warned he would ―come back‖ to do the same to Michelle if she told\n\n                                               8\n\fanyone what had happened. Michelle nonetheless reported the incident to her family and\nthe police and testified at the subsequent trial. Defendant was convicted of felony\nforcible oral copulation with a minor and sentenced to state prison.\n       In April 1987, Samira S. was 15 years old and living with her mother and younger\nsister in Paramount, California, when defendant, a family friend, moved in. Within two\nor three weeks, he began fondling and kissing Samira when they were alone. She would\ntell him to stop, but defendant would continue touching different parts of her body.\nSubsequently, defendant forced Samira to perform oral sex on him, slapping her when\nshe did not perform to his satisfaction. Samira thereafter engaged in oral sex with\ndefendant once or twice a week between April and September of 1987. If she resisted,\ndefendant would get angry and slap her. Defendant repeatedly tried to convince Samira\nto have sexual intercourse with him but she refused. Nevertheless, he would put Vaseline\nor baby oil on his penis and partially penetrate her vagina. Defendant also asked to take\nnaked photographs of Samira, but she refused. Sometimes defendant would give Samira\nmoney and buy her gifts. He also caused her to be truant from her summer school\ncourses. In September or October of 1987, Samira told a friend from church and a school\ncounselor about defendant‘s sexual assaults. He was convicted of two counts of oral\ncopulation with a minor and sentenced to state prison.\n\n              c) Victim impact evidence\n       The prosecution introduced the testimony of family members of the victims who\ntestified about qualities of their loved one and how each learned about the murders. Jose\nSilva was the youngest of 10 children and was raised by his older sister Josefina after\ntheir mother died. He regularly attended family functions and had a one-year-old son at\nthe time of his death. David Smith had been married to his wife Mimi for 10 years when\nhe died and had a daughter named Tiffany. His half brother described Smith as someone\nwho loved the outdoors and as ―a very gentle soul.‖ Wayne Sonke had five adult\n\n\n                                             9\n\fchildren and five grandchildren at the time of his death. His daughter Lois Backe\ndescribed being at her mother‘s house waiting for Sonke to return home from work when\nthe fire department called asking for Sonke and saying that the alarms had gone off at\nSOS. After her father still had not returned or called home, Backe drove to SOS. A\npolice officer on the scene told her there had been a triple homicide and asked Backe to\ndescribe her father. She later had to give the news of his murder to her youngest brother\nand mother.\n\n          2. The defense’s case in mitigation\n\n              a) Family and social history\n       Ronald Forbush, a defense investigator, researched defendant‘s personal and\nsocial history and interviewed various relatives. Defendant‘s parents Vivian and Maurice\nCunningham divorced when defendant was approximately two years old. Vivian had a\nprior marriage at age 14, two subsequent marriages, and apparently worked at some point\nas a prostitute. Maurice subsequently remarried as well. As a result, defendant had two\nolder brothers, Sam and W.C., and several half siblings and stepbrothers and stepsisters.\nAt the time of the trial, defendant‘s parents were deceased, and his brother Sam was in\nHuntsville State Prison in Texas.\n       Vivian‘s younger half sister Carolyn M. testified that Vivian was dishonest; at\nvarious times she had lied about a brother having died, about being in a car accident, and\nabout her middle son (W.C.) having died. Carolyn also recounted one evening when she\nwas in seventh grade and Vivian and Maurice were living in the same house as the rest of\nthe family when Carolyn awoke to find Maurice sexually molesting her.\n       Defendant‘s brother W.C. testified their mother and father both had problems with\nalcohol. One time, when W.C. was under 10 years old, Vivian, intoxicated, called him\ninto her bedroom and sexually fondled him. After he left, she called the other two\nbrothers into the room one by one. Vivian‘s sexual abuse may have been recurring.\n\n\n                                             10\n\fMaurice and Gene Collins, a stepfather, physically abused the boys. One time, after a\nviolent confrontation with Collins in which Vivian stabbed him with a fork, she\nabandoned her three sons (then ages five, seven, and nine) for several weeks and they\nwere forced to steal food to survive. Eventually, the boys were placed in an orphanage\nfor approximately a year. Later they were flown to California to live with Maurice, his\nsecond wife Betty, and her children from a previous marriage. W.C. believed that his\nfather sexually abused his stepsister, although Maurice never molested W.C. or, to the\nbest of W.C.‘s knowledge, defendant or their brother Sam.\n       One of defendant‘s stepbrothers testified that Maurice was a heavy drinker who\noften became violent with Betty and the children. Maurice also sexually molested the\nstepbrother so often he ―couldn‘t count the times.‖ Once when he was in seventh grade,\nthe stepbrother told his mother Betty about the molestation. She cried but never did\nanything to stop it.\n       Diana Jamison, one of defendant‘s former girlfriends, testified she got the\nimpression from defendant that his mother, Vivian, was very promiscuous when he was a\nyoung boy and had many different men coming in and out of her life. Defendant also\nalluded to having been sexually molested by his father, but would not discuss any details\nwith Jamison.\n       Some of the sexual abuse detailed by the above witnesses was confirmed or\nalluded to by defendant in his interviews with Thomas Williams, one of the defense‘s\npenalty phase psychologists.\n\n              b) Military background\n       After defendant graduated from high school, he enlisted in the United States\nArmy. According to relevant military files and records, defendant was court-martialed\nvarious times for being absent without leave (AWOL) between May 1969 and March\n1970. In May 1970, defendant was sent to Vietnam for approximately 11 months where\n\n\n                                            11\n\fhe was promoted three times, ultimately to sergeant. As a result of his service in the\nVietnam War, defendant received several commendations.\n       While in Vietnam, defendant engaged in reconnaissance missions with units that\nwould travel through the jungles for periods of five to 14 days scouting and securing\nareas believed to be infiltrated by the Viet Cong or North Vietnamese Army. The units\nset up claymore mines for mechanical ambushes and engaged in several firefights in\nwhich enemy troops or sympathizers were killed or captured. Defendant at one time\noperated in a ―free fire zone,‖ meaning that the soldiers had permission to kill any enemy\ncombatants in that area. Sometimes a unit would happen upon empty enemy bunkers or\nmass enemy graves; other times it found ―blood trails‖ left by the enemy dragging their\nwounded or dead soldiers away from combat scenes. If a unit encountered an enemy\nvillage in an uncontrolled area not authorized for settlement, standard operating\nprocedure was to evacuate the people and set the buildings on fire. Once, defendant\nrequired medical attention due to heat exhaustion. Another time, he was hospitalized for\na malaria infection.\n       Nineteen veterans who served in defendant‘s reconnaissance platoons testified\nabout their daily activities and various missions in Vietnam. Some of the veterans who\ntestified characterized defendant as a ―good soldier‖ but also as a ―loner‖ who generally\nkept to himself. Others did not specifically remember defendant. Three veterans,\nincluding one who allegedly knew defendant the best, for various reasons were unable to\nattend the trial and testify.\n       Many of the veterans who testified suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD), flashbacks, depression, or other problems as a result of their service in Vietnam.\nThese veterans explained they often had problems adjusting to life after Vietnam, and\nmany of those adjustment problems remained with them throughout their lives. They had\ntrouble sleeping, were regularly afflicted by nightmares, and experienced problems with\nanxiety, hypervigilance, and being easily startled by innocuous sounds (such as a car\n                                            12\n\fbackfire or a motorcycle) or simple sights (like a tree stump). One witness compared the\nexperience of suffering from PTSD to ―carrying a demon around at times.‖ However,\nnone had committed any felonies or crimes of violence after they returned home.\n       Cross-examination further revealed that other than the death of a medic from a\nmortar accident on base, there were no casualties or fatalities in any of defendant‘s\nplatoons. Defendant was never captured or tortured by the enemy, and none of his units\never destroyed a village in a manner that killed women and children. Defendant did not\nparticipate in long-range reconnaissance patrols or Special Forces. Although the\nreconnaissance platoons rarely took prisoners, on one occasion, defendant‘s unit took 30\nto 50 prisoners, including women and children who were sympathetic to the enemy, but\nnone of the prisoners were bound or mistreated in any way.\n       After Vietnam, defendant was stationed for the remainder of his three-year tour at\nFort Hood, Texas, where he was court-martialed four different times for being AWOL.\nUltimately, he was demoted from his sergeant rank and honorably discharged as a\nprivate.\n\n              c) Psychological evidence concerning posttraumatic stress disorder\n       G. Robert Baker and Thomas Williams testified for the defense as experts on\nPTSD, among other topics. Baker was a psychologist with the Department of Veterans\nAffairs and clinical coordinator for the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder. Williams was a psychologist who specialized in working with trauma victims\nand training individuals involved in treating veterans. Both served in Vietnam in the\nMarines Corps.\n       Baker and Williams described PTSD as a reaction to unusual and frightful events\noutside the normal range of human experiences, such as those experienced in war zones.\nThe symptoms of PTSD include nightmares, intrusive and unwanted thoughts and\nimages, flashbacks, avoidance and dissociative behaviors, depression, psychiatric\n\n\n                                            13\n\fnumbing, social isolation, disassociation from and distrust of others, anxiety, sleep\ndisorders, anger management problems, hypervigilance, adrenalin- or sensation-seeking\nbehaviors, memory impairment, and concentration difficulties. Although there is no cure\nfor PTSD, the symptoms can be treated and individuals can be taught how to manage\nthem.\n        Williams explained symptoms such as flashbacks or nightmares could happen at\nany time depending on the particular individual and his experiences. However, certain\nstimuli would be expected to trigger them. Military training in particular sensitized\nsoldiers to various stimuli and caused them to react quickly to perceived danger. PTSD\nmay also be retriggered by secondary traumatic experiences, or compounded by\npreceding ones. According to Baker, although soldiers suffering from PTSD might be\nexpected to avoid events such as fireworks displays, which can trigger combat memories,\nthey might still carry guns, which would likewise trigger combat memories, because guns\nwere a source of protection. Recurrence of malaria symptoms also can act as a PTSD\ntrigger, although malaria infections themselves, which were common in Vietnam, did not\ncause PTSD. Baker also explained the concept of ―survivor guilt‖ and how soldiers who\nsuffered from PTSD often exaggerated their combat roles.\n        Both experts explained how the Vietnam conflict presented unique difficulties for\nmany reasons—most of the soldiers were very young, the war had no front lines, there\nwere no clearly defined objectives other than killing people, it was often unclear who was\nthe enemy, there were no safe areas in light of the guerrilla nature of the war, there was\nno winning strategy, the primary goal was survival, there was little unit cohesion because\nsoldiers were constantly being replaced, the jungle environment made living conditions\ndifficult, and neither the Vietnamese civilian population nor the American public\nappreciated the soldiers. These factors made it more difficult to treat Vietnam War\nveterans suffering from PTSD. In particular, the social isolation Vietnam veterans felt\nupon returning home prevented them from seeking treatment. In defendant‘s case, the\n                                             14\n\fisolation was exacerbated because he did not have a loving and supportive family or\nreligion to turn to upon his return. Present-day treatments for PTSD, moreover, were not\navailable to veterans in the early 1970s, as the disorder was not well understood at that\ntime.\n        Based on his review of defendant‘s records, Baker opined defendant was involved\nin the type of combat that could produce PTSD. However, he never met or evaluated\ndefendant for PTSD. Baker explained how individuals are screened for PTSD and the\nimportance of confirming the truthfulness of reported personal histories in rendering a\ndiagnosis, as malingering—feigning the symptoms of a disorder—can apply to someone\nclaiming to suffer from PTSD.\n        Williams positively diagnosed defendant as having PTSD. This diagnosis was\nbased on his interviews of defendant for three days in May and June of 1995, and his\nreview of the videotapes of defendant‘s interviews with the detectives and the\nreenactment, charts of the daily activities of defendant‘s Vietnam units, statements of\nfamily members and the veterans who served with defendant, and the penalty phase\ntestimony of various witnesses. Williams did not, however, meet with any of the\nwitnesses from the case.\n        In his interviews with Williams, defendant said when his mother abandoned him\nand his brothers, their electricity and water were turned off and they had to steal food to\neat and use neighbors‘ swimming pools to bathe. Defendant further claimed he broke\ninto other people‘s homes to observe what normal childhood and family life was like. He\ntold Williams that he was isolated in the orphanage. He alluded to being sexually\nmolested by his mother once, and told Williams that he was once sexually fondled by his\nfather, had personally observed his father having sex with his half sister at least once, and\n―quite frequently‖ heard his stepbrother screaming as Maurice sodomized him. Although\ndefendant refused to give details of the alleged molestation by his mother, saying ―he was\ngoing to take that to his grave,‖ Williams felt the brother‘s reported sexual abuse by\n                                             15\n\fVivian and the literature on sexual abuse—which stated generally all the children are\nsexually abused within a family that has sexual abuse—corroborated defendant‘s claim of\nabuse by his mother. Williams further noted that observing sexual abuse could cause\nPTSD.\n        Williams opined defendant‘s PTSD was caused by childhood neglect and sexual\nabuse, as well as combat experiences in Vietnam. Defendant most likely developed\nPTSD when he was about nine years old, and then was retraumatized in Vietnam, which\ncontributed to his then-current PTSD. Although he believed defendant had PTSD when\nhe robbed Gill and committed the sexual offenses against Michelle I. and Samira S.,\nWilliams could not say whether defendant was going through a dissociative episode when\nhe committed those offenses. Williams conceded child molestation, robbery, and murder\nwere not part of the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Although Williams found defendant to\nhave an ―[i]nability to delay sexual gratification and generally poor sexual adjustment,‖\nhe did not consider defendant a pedophile or sex addict.\n        Defendant told Williams he had always had an active ―fantasy life,‖ had difficulty\nat times distinguishing fantasy from reality, and relied on dreams for memory. When\nrelating stories about Vietnam, defendant was not sure whether they really happened or\nnot. Williams believed this was dissociative behavior indicative of PTSD. It was clear to\nWilliams defendant‘s Vietnam service was very important to him, ―a cornerstone in his\nlife.‖ Williams acknowledged defendant made inaccurate or untrue claims about his\nmilitary background and Vietnam experiences during the police interviews. He also was\naware defendant had altered a form regarding his military experience, listing training and\nawards he did not receive and operations in which he did not participate, and deleting\nreferences to his AWOLs. Williams agreed falsification of military records might\nindicate a ―factitious‖ PTSD disorder or malingering, and it was also possible defendant‘s\nfalse Vietnam stories were unrelated to PTSD and only ―embellishments of war stories.‖\n\n\n                                            16\n\f       Based on his review of autopsy photographs and defendant‘s statements to law\nenforcement officers, Williams opined defendant ―dissociated‖ at some point during the\nSOS killings. As a result of this altered state of mind, although defendant knew robbery\nwas wrong at the time, he did not ―really internally believe[]‖ he had committed the\nmurders until he participated in the reenactment. In support of this conclusion, Williams\ncited defendant‘s claim he felt like he was standing behind himself watching the crimes\nhappen, his shooting the victims even though they were bound with tape and he already\nhad the money, his viewing Smith as a threat when Smith broke his bonds, defendant‘s\nreference to ―the LT‖ or lieutenant instructing soldiers ―to always burn the village, never\nleave anyone behind, kill everyone,‖ and the physical distress defendant manifested in the\nvideo reenactment of the crime. Although defendant did not refer to his dreams during\nthe reenactment as he had done in the first interview, Williams still felt defendant was\n―drifting‖ during the reenactment. Williams also related some of defendant‘s behaviors\nto experiences defendant had had in Vietnam, such as arming himself with a gun, using\nduct tape, and shooting the victims in the head even if they might already have been dead.\nHe conceded, however, a person who intentionally makes a decision to injure another or\nrob someone in order to take money would ―probably‖ not be acting due to PTSD.\n       Defendant also took a self-administered and unsupervised test called the\nDissociation Experiences Scale (DES). Based on the DES, Williams concluded\ndefendant had a high level of dissociative experiences. Another self-administered and\nunsupervised test, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI-2),\nindicated defendant was distrustful and moody, had poor social skills, and was not\nmalingering. Two subscales within the MMPI-2 scored defendant positive for PTSD.\nHowever, defendant declined to answer five questions out of 568, which prompted the\ntesting service to state ―the pattern of his item omission should be carefully noted.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f              d) Prior crimes\n       Daniel and Olivia Negron knew Samira S. and her mother through church. While\ndefendant was residing in Samira‘s home, the Negrons attended social functions during\nwhich Samira sat on defendant‘s lap and appeared to be ―very flirtatious with‖ and\n―coming on‖ to him in an inappropriate manner.\n       Damarie H., Samira‘s aunt, stayed at Samira‘s home for approximately six\nmonths, during which time defendant was sleeping on the sofa. Damarie noticed Samira\ndid not shy away from the attention she received from defendant. Concerned about their\nrelationship, she asked Samira if ―anything was going on‖ with defendant. Samira\nbecame defensive, saying her mother was ―starting to get on her case about the same\nthing.‖ Samira told her aunt defendant was ―very nice‖ and she cared for him, and tried\nto imply there was something going on between defendant and her mother. According to\nDamarie, Samira was not always truthful. Although Samira bruised easily as a result of\nhaving lupus, Damarie did not recall seeing any bruises on her during the time defendant\nwas staying with them.\n       Deputy Sheriff Pierre Nadeau interviewed Samira in October 1987. When asked\nabout bruising around her eyes and swelling on the back of her head, Samira told Nadeau\nshe had been injured fighting with her mother. When Deputy Sheriff Goran interviewed\nSamira, she never mentioned defendant had slapped her, but said she was afraid to say no\nto defendant because other men had previously slapped or beat her for refusing sex.\nWhen Dr. Kerry English examined Samira, she also did not tell him that defendant had\nslapped her. Although she indicated defendant had twice attempted to have sexual\nintercourse with her, she stated defendant stopped because it was painful for her.\n\n          3. The prosecution’s rebuttal in aggravation\n       Detective Nottingham testified defendant told him during the Deadwood, South\nDakota, interview that he had spent two years in Vietnam and served in the Special\n\n\n                                            18\n\fForces. Nottingham further explained how he found the original and altered forms\nrelating to defendant‘s military record.\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n          1. Pretrial shackling\n       Defendant claims he was denied his state and federal constitutional rights to due\nprocess and a fair trial when he was ―repeatedly and unnecessarily‖ restrained during\npretrial proceedings without an adequate showing of manifest need and without\nemploying less restrictive alternatives. He argues the shackling rendered his trial\nstructurally unsound and resulted in prejudice. This claim is meritless.\n\n              a) Background\n       During the initial hearing on defendant‘s motion to suppress his statements to law\nenforcement officers, defense counsel objected to defendant‘s being shackled in the\ncourtroom. The trial court ordered defendant‘s waist chains removed and his hands\nplaced in regular handcuffs in front of his body. After counsel continued to object to the\nhandcuffs, the prosecutor placed on the record various reasons justifying the shackling,\nincluding that defendant was being tried for three capital murders and had specialized\nmilitary training. The court ultimately ruled the ―limited restraints‖ would remain for\npurposes of the current proceedings.\n       At the next hearing, defense counsel objected to any shackling of defendant,\nindicating defendant would ―waive all appearances if he has to go through this shackling\nbusiness.‖ The court stated it was willing to order defendant not be restrained in the\ncourtroom and to be restrained only during transit in the public halls of the courthouse, a\nroutine security measure in the San Bernardino courthouse not limited to defendant. The\nprosecutor concurred and the court ordered defendant ―not be shackled in the courtroom.‖\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f       Defendant subsequently filed a motion objecting to the use of restraints in the\nholding areas of the courthouse, where he might be kept for several hours before a court\nappearance, and further requesting the case be transferred back to the Rancho\nCucamonga courthouse, where the preliminary hearing had been held and where in-\ntransit shackling apparently was not required. The trial court ultimately ordered that\ndefendant not be restrained in the holding facilities or the courtroom. However, it found\nthe standard procedure of shackling prisoners during public transit between the holding\ncell and the courtroom to be a reasonable security precaution and denied without\nprejudice the request to transfer the case to Rancho Cucamonga.\n       Later, defendant appeared in court to personally waive his presence at that and all\nfuture pretrial hearings. Although his legs were shackled at the time, the court assured\ndefendant the shackles would be removed in the courtroom if he chose to participate in\nthe proceedings. After defendant waived his presence, counsel asked he not be\ntransported to court again until the penalty phase jury trial or transfer of the case to\nRancho Cucamonga.\n       The balance of pretrial proceedings as well as the guilt phase bench trial took\nplace in San Bernardino. Thereafter, defendant filed a written request to have the penalty\nphase tried in Rancho Cucamonga with jurors from its West End Judicial District. The\ntrial court denied the request in part, ordering that jury selection occur in San Bernardino\nbut that the panel be drawn exclusively from the West End. Defendant was ordered to\npersonally appear to address jury selection issues but his counsel objected, claiming that\nthe court‘s promises concerning shackling had not been kept and again objecting to the\nin-transit shackling. The court overruled the objection, finding it had accommodated\ndefendant throughout the proceedings. Subsequent pre-penalty-phase proceedings and\nthe initial portion of jury selection (primarily hardship excusals and challenges for cause\nbased on the juror questionnaires) took place in San Bernardino, but the remainder of jury\n\n\n                                              20\n\fselection and the penalty phase trial took place in Rancho Cucamonga, after which there\nwere no further shackling objections.\n\n              b) Analysis\n       No defendant ―may be subjected, before conviction, to any more restraint than is\nnecessary for his [or her] detention to answer the charge.‖ (§ 688.) However, an\nappellate court will not overturn a trial court‘s decision to restrain a defendant ―absent ‗a\nshowing of a manifest abuse of discretion.‘ ‖ (People v. Wallace (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1050 (Wallace).)\n       The jurisprudence on shackling primarily concerns situations that might prejudice\na jury. Such cases hold that under state law, in light of the potential harm to the\nconstitutional presumption of innocence and right to be present and participate in one‘s\ndefense, ― ‗[a] defendant cannot be subjected to physical restraints of any kind in the\ncourtroom while in the jury‘s presence, unless there is a showing of a manifest need for\nsuch restraints.‘ ‖ (Wallace, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1050, quoting People v.

Not so. The considerations\nof public safety and the need for restraints are different during prisoner transport than\nwhen a defendant is seated in a secured courtroom. We have long observed that a\ndefendant may be restrained while in transit between a jail and the courtroom without\nreference to any particularized showing of need. (See, e.g., People v.

The shackling was a reasonable and limited\nprecaution taken to retain custody of an accused and was no more restraint than was\nnecessary for his detention. The in-transit physical restraints in no way affected the\nconduct or outcome of the trial, whether before judge or jury, nor did they impinge upon\nthe presumption of innocence or defendant‘s right to present a defense.\n       In his reply, defendant argues that given the necessity of shackling him for\ntransport through the halls to his courtroom in San Bernardino, ―the unreasonable burden\nplaced on this defendant should have been ameliorated by moving the proceeding to a\ndifferent courtroom or to Rancho Cucamonga.‖ He cites no authority to support this\nproposition, nor are we aware of any. As noted, defendant‘s shackling for security during\ntransport was a limited and reasonable imposition. The trial court was not required to\nmove the proceedings to a different courtroom or to the Rancho Cucamonga courthouse\nsimply to obviate this precaution.\n\n          2. Waiver of the right to be present at pretrial and guilt phase\n             proceedings\n       Defendant claims the trial court violated his state and federal constitutional rights\nto due process and a fair trial when it excused him from numerous pretrial proceedings\nand the guilt phase of his trial based on a waiver of his personal presence that allegedly\nwas coerced by ―painful, excessive, and unnecessary shackling.‖ He additionally\n\n                                             22\n\fcontends the trial court violated sections 977 and 1043 by accepting involuntary waivers\nof his right to be personally present at the guilt phase of his capital murder trial without\nadequate justification.\n\n              a) Constitutional right to be present\n       ―Under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to be personally present at\nany proceeding in which his appearance is necessary to prevent ‗interference with [his]\nopportunity for effective cross-examination.‘ [Citations.] Due process guarantees the\nright to be present at any ‗stage . . . that is critical to [the] outcome‘ and where the\ndefendant‘s ‗presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure.‘ ‖ (People v.\nButler (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625727\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625727/people-v-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 861.) The state constitutional right to be present at trial,\nwhich is guaranteed by article I of the California Constitution, ― ‗is generally coextensive\nwith the federal due process right.‘ ‖ (Butler, at p. 861.) As a matter of both federal and\nstate constitutional law, however, a defendant may validly waive his or her right to be\npresent during a critical stage of the trial, provided the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and\nvoluntary. (People v. Moon (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630004\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630004/people-v-moon/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20–21 (Moon); People v.

He contends he was forced to waive his presence ―simply because he could\nnot endure the effects of the wrist, waist and leg chains every day for more than eight\nhours a day.‖ (Italics added.) The record demonstrates, however, that the trial court\nrelieved defendant of all physical restraints in the courtroom and holding cell prior to any\nevidentiary hearings or critical phases of the postarraignment proceedings. Thereafter,\ndefendant remained subjected to physical restraints only for the time it took to transport\nhim to and from the holding cell and the courtroom. Having concluded that this limited\nin-transit shackling was not an abuse of the trial court‘s discretion, we further conclude\n\n\n                                              23\n\fthe use of restraints in transit did not improperly coerce defendant to waive his presence\nat the pretrial and guilt phase proceedings, particularly as the court permitted him to\nremain completely unrestrained in the courtroom.\n         An analogous situation was presented in People v. Price (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1237936\"><a href=\"/opinion/1237936/people-v-price/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Price). After a hearing outside the presence of the jury during which the evidence\nestablished the defendant had committed multiple acts and threats of violence against\nofficers at the jail or while being transported to court, the court ordered he be secured to\nhis chair in the courtroom by a single belly chain not visible to the jury. The defendant\nthen stated ―he would rather be absent from the trial than appear before the jury in chains.\nThe trial court allowed defendant to leave the courtroom and return to the jail, after\ninforming defendant that his leaving would be construed as a voluntary waiver of\npresence. After giving the matter further thought, the court directed jail officers to bring\ndefendant back to the courtroom, but defendant refused to dress in civilian clothing for\nthe court appearance. The court then concluded that defendant had effectively waived his\npresence. The remainder of the guilt phase proceeded in his absence.‖ (Id. at pp. 404–\n405.)\n         On appeal, we found ―no constitutional infirmity in the trial court‘s decisions . . .\nto accept defendant‘s actions as a voluntary waiver and to proceed with the guilt phase in\ndefendant‘s absence.‖ (Price, supra, 1 Cal.4th at p. 405.) Similarly here, we find no\nconstitutional infirmity in defendant‘s waivers of his right to be present at pretrial\nproceedings and the guilt phase, even assuming such waivers were motivated in part by\nconcerns about the in-transit shackling that would have accompanied his appearing in\ncourt.\n\n                b) Statutory right to be present\n         The issue of statutory error is another matter. As we have previously\nacknowledged, ―defendant‘s statutory ability to waive his presence in a capital case is\n\n\n                                               24\n\fmore circumscribed than the associated ability to waive his constitutional right.‖ (People\nv. Rundle (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633881\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633881/people-v-rundle/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 135 (Rundle); see also Jackson, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p.\n1211.) Specifically, section 977 requires any defendant charged with a felony to ―be\npersonally present at the arraignment, at the time of plea, during the preliminary hearing,\nduring those portions of the trial when evidence is taken before the trier of fact, and at the\ntime of the imposition of sentence. The accused shall be personally present at all other\nproceedings unless he or she shall, with leave of court, execute in open court, a written\nwaiver of his or her right to be personally present, as provided by paragraph (2).‖ (§ 977,\nsubd. (b)(1), italics added.) Section 1043 provides that a felony defendant ―shall be\npersonally present at the trial‖ (id., subd. (a)), but that the trial may continue in a\ndefendant‘s absence if the defendant (1) persists in disruptive behavior after being\nwarned (id., subd. (b)(1)); (2) is voluntarily absent in ―[a]ny prosecution for an offense\nwhich is not punishable by death‖ (id., subd. (b)(2), italics added); or (3) has waived his\nrights ―in accordance with Section 977‖ (id., subd. (d)). Read together, the statutes\nprovide that a capital defendant cannot voluntarily waive his right to be present during\nthe proceedings listed in section 977, including those portions of the trial in which\nevidence is taken, and he may not be removed from the courtroom pursuant to section\n1043 unless he has been disruptive or threatens to be disruptive.\n       Defendant correctly contends his absence during the guilt phase violated sections\n977 and 1043. However, assuming defendant has not forfeited his claim of statutory\nerror by failing to raise it below (see Rundle, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 135), the error does\nnot warrant reversal of the judgment because it is not reasonably probable the result of\nthe trial would have been more favorable to defendant absent the error. (See People v.\nWeaver (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633370\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633370/people-v-weaver/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 968.) Defendant fails to explain how he could have\neffectively assisted counsel in subjecting the prosecution‘s case to meaningful adversarial\ntesting. We therefore conclude the violations of sections 977 and 1043 were harmless.\n(See, e.g., Moon, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 21.)\n                                               25\n\f        Relying upon Hicks v.

(See Rundle, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p.\n136.)\n\n           3. Waiver of the right to a guilt phase jury\n        Defendant claims the ―wanton infliction of pain‖ caused by the daily courthouse\nshackling not only coerced a waiver of his right to be present at the guilt phase, but also\nresulted in the involuntary waiver of his right to a jury trial at the guilt phase in order to\navoid the alleged ―embarrassment and prejudice‖ attendant to being tried by a jury while\nhe was not present. He argues the failure to obtain a knowing and intelligent waiver of\nhis right to a jury trial violated his state and federal constitutional right to due process and\nrequires the reversal of his conviction. As with his claim concerning the waiver of his\nright to be present, this claim is without merit.\n        At a pretrial status conference, the prosecutor informed the court he had discussed\nwith defense counsel the possibility of having a bench trial for the guilt phase. Defense\ncounsel confirmed, stating ―I am inclined to agree to recommend to my client that if he‘s\nagreeable, then we‘re agreeable to a court trial on the guilt phase[, although w]e would\nstill want a jury trial in the penalty phase.‖ At the next status conference, defense counsel\nconfirmed defendant had filed a written waiver of his right to a jury trial of the guilt\nphase, stating, ―[W]e don‘t wish to have a jury decide [the issue of defendant‘s guilt or\ninnocence,] just the court.‖ The court indicated a personal appearance by defendant was\nrequired for the waiver to be effective.\n        Defendant subsequently appeared in person via closed-circuit television to waive\nhis right to a guilt phase jury trial. In response to questioning by the court, defendant\n\n\n                                              26\n\findicated he understood (1) he had an absolute right to a jury trial in both the guilt and\npenalty phases of his trial, (2) in a jury trial, if one of the 12 jurors was not convinced\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty, the jury could not return a guilty\nverdict, (3) if he waived his right to a jury trial, instead of 12 people deciding the issue of\nhis guilt or innocence, the judge alone would make that decision, and (4) it could be\neasier for the prosecution to convince only one person, as opposed to 12, that defendant\nwas guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant nevertheless stated he wished to waive\nhis right to a jury trial for the guilt phase, confirming he had discussed the issue with his\ncounsel, who concurred in the waiver.\n       As relevant here, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:\n―In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public\ntrial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been\ncommitted . . . .‖ (See also Cal. Const., art. I, § 16 (―Trial by jury is an inviolate right and\nshall be secured to all . . . .‖].) Although trial by jury is a fundamental constitutional\nright, a criminal defendant may waive the right. (See Adams v. United States (1942) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103735\"><a href=\"/opinion/103735/adams-v-united-states-ex-rel-mccann/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275; see also Cal. Const., art. I, § 16.)

Conversely, the record does not support defendant‘s\ncontention that his waiver was induced by the ―inhumane courtroom restraints in the San\n                                              27\n\fBernardino County Courthouse.‖ Having been relieved of all physical restraints in the\ncourtroom and holding cell well before the guilt phase commenced, defendant would\nhave been restrained during the trial only for the time it took to transport him to and from\nthe holding cell and the courtroom. Having concluded this limited in-transit shackling\nwas not an abuse of the trial court‘s discretion and did not improperly coerce defendant to\nwaive his right to be present, we further conclude it did not improperly coerce\ndefendant‘s waiver of his right to a jury trial for the guilt phase, particularly as he was\npermitted to remain completely unrestrained while in the courtroom.\n\n           4. The guilt phase bench trial as tantamount to a “slow plea of guilty”\n       Defendant claims defense counsel failed to mount a defense at the guilt phase—\npresenting no affirmative witnesses, evidence, or defenses and conceding defendant‘s\nguilt on all the charges—and contends this failure was the ―functional equivalent of a\nslow plea of guilty‖ that denied defendant his state and federal constitutional rights to\nenter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea following a full advisement of rights and\nexpress waiver of those rights. Respondent argues that defendant forfeited this claim by\nrepeatedly rejecting the trial court‘s offers to set aside the guilt phase verdict and grant\nhim a new guilt phase trial with or without a jury, or, in the alternative, that defendant is\nbarred from raising it under the doctrine of invited error.

Although\nin agreeing to the stipulation defendant gave up his right to a jury trial, he was advised of\nand personally waived this right. In so stipulating he did not give up the right to\nconfrontation and cross-examination or to remain silent. To the contrary, defendant\nenjoyed a full court trial during which he confronted, cross-examined, and attempted to\nimpeach the prosecution witnesses, and exercised his right against self-incrimination by\nnot taking the witness stand. Having fully exercised these rights, there was no need for\ndefendant to waive them. Additionally, defense counsel conceded neither guilt nor the\nnecessary elements of the various offenses, but rather required the prosecution to prove\nevery element of every crime through the testimony of 16 witnesses and attempted to\nraise reasonable doubt in various areas. As counsel stated in closing argument, although\ndefendant may have wished to take responsibility for the crimes, ―failing a settlement that\nI can live with, as a lawyer I must contest the charges.‖\n\n          5. The admission of defendant’s statements to law enforcement officers\n             and his videotaped reenactment\n       Defendant claims the trial court erred in admitting in both the guilt and penalty\nphases of the trial the contents of his custodial interrogations and his videotaped\nreenactment at the SOS store, in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights to\ndue process, to be free from self-incrimination, and to be subjected to custodial\ninterrogation only with the assistance of counsel. According to defendant, law\nenforcement officers deliberately violated Miranda, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ignored an\nunambiguous request for counsel, and used a variety of coercive tactics that, when\nconsidered in their totality, demonstrate his statements were involuntary. He argues that\nas a result, the incriminating statements were the product of repeated and intentional\nviolations of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution, and that the\nallegedly erroneous admission of the confessions was prejudicial.\n\n                                             30\n\f       As discussed below, we conclude defendant understood the Miranda warnings he\nwas given, validly waived his Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent and to an attorney,\nand made uncoerced statements to law enforcement officers. We therefore reject\ndefendant‘s arguments regarding his taped statements and the video reenactment.\n\n              a) Background\n       The prosecution first sought to introduce defendant‘s various interviews and the\nvideo reenactment during the preliminary hearing. Defense counsel objected. At a\nhearing on the issue, a magistrate judge found the detectives did not violate Miranda,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, did not make any false statements inducing the confessions, and did\nnot improperly fail to clarify a request for counsel. The judge further concluded\ndefendant was properly advised of and knew his rights, and the statements and the video\nreenactment were made freely and voluntarily.\n       Before the guilt phase, defense counsel moved to suppress the custodial\nstatements, any resulting admissions, and the video reenactment. The trial court held an\nevidentiary hearing at which evidence was presented concerning defendant‘s previous\ninterrogations by law enforcement officers in April 1982 and January 1988 in connection\nwith charges of oral copulation with Michelle I. and child molestation of Samira S.,\nrespectively. In each instance, defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and asked if\nhe understood them, whether he wanted to talk about the case, and whether he wanted a\nlawyer; in each instance defendant agreed to talk to the officers without a lawyer and\neither wrote down his responses to the waiver questions or signed a waiver statement.\n       Ontario Police Department detectives testified about an exchange that occurred\nduring the preliminary six minutes of their initial meeting with defendant in Deadwood,\nSouth Dakota before they gave him the first Miranda warning. After introductions and\ngeneral questions about defendant‘s welfare, defendant asked detectives whether his\ngirlfriend, Costello, was in jail. Detective Ortiz responded, ―She‘s in our custody. She‘s\n\n\n                                            31\n\fsafeguarded.‖3 When defendant claimed that Costello was ―not involved in any of this‖\nand ―shouldn‘t be in custody,‖ the detectives responded, ―[T]hat‘s what we need to find\nout from you. . . . And this is your opportunity, okay . . . . We both have [the] suspicion\n. . . that . . . she didn‘t have nothing [sic] to do with anything that happened before . . .\nyou started running. But basically we wanted to find out from you.‖ They also related\narriving at Folsom Prison to transport defendant to the video reenactment. The trial court\nadditionally considered the preliminary hearing testimony of three law enforcement\nofficers who were involved in the traffic stop and arrest of defendant.\n       Finally, several police officers testified concerning the department‘s practice at the\ntime of defendant‘s interrogations of deliberately omitting the ―express waiver‖ question\nfrom Ontario Police Department form 4.17, from which Miranda advisements were read.\nThat question asked whether, having the Miranda rights in mind, the suspect wished to\ntalk to about the case. The practice of omitting this question was based on police\ntraining, information gleaned from prosecutors, and confirmation from the courts\nindicating such waiver was unnecessary. In October 1992, after defendant was\ninterrogated, the San Bernardino County District Attorney‘s Office issued a\nmemorandum advising the department to ask the express waiver question in their\ninterrogations.\n       With respect to the motion to suppress, the trial court found the detectives‘\ncomments during the first six minutes of the initial Deadwood interview, prior to giving a\nMiranda admonition about Costello being ―in custody‖ and ―safeguarded,‖ to which\ndefendant responded by protesting Costello‘s innocence, constituted psychological\ninducement or ―softening up‖ likely to evoke incriminating statements. Therefore,\ndefendant‘s responses during that time had been obtained in violation of Miranda. As to\nhis later statements after the first Miranda admonition, the court found by a\n\n3     It appears that Costello in fact was staying at a hotel with a law enforcement\nmatron.\n                                               32\n\fpreponderance of the evidence under the totality of the circumstances that defendant\nunderstood his constitutional rights, and his implied waiver of those rights ―was\nvoluntary and was a result of his own desire to make statements‖ and not the product of\nthe prior improper influences. The trial court also found that: (1) defendant‘s\nincriminating statements were not induced by improper police conduct; (2) there was no\nbad faith intent to violate his Miranda rights, as the detectives had a good faith belief that\nthe practice of not obtaining an express waiver was lawful; (3) defendant‘s ambiguous\ncomment about having ―someone here to talk for me‖ did not constitute an invocation of\nthe right to counsel; and (4) no further Miranda advisements were required for the\nsecond, third and fourth Deadwood interviews because their purpose was merely to\nbriefly clarify matters covered in the first interrogation.\n       With respect to the video reenactment, the court found (1) Sergeant Lewis‘s\ninquiry at Folsom Prison concerning whether defendant was willing to cooperate with\nauthorities in an ―ongoing investigation of a murder in a warehouse‖ was not a custodial\ninterrogation requiring a Miranda warning, and nothing Lewis said or did improperly\ninduced defendant‘s agreement to cooperate; (2) later, more specific questioning by the\ndetectives who went to the prison to retrieve defendant for the reenactment was improper\nbecause an affirmative answer to the question whether defendant remained willing ―to\nreenact the crimes,‖ in and of itself, would be incriminating, but this one question did not\ninfluence defendant‘s previous agreement to cooperate; and (3) the reenactment was\nvalidly conducted after a full Miranda advisement with an express waiver.\n       Consequently, the court ruled defendant‘s multiple statements and confessions\nwere admissible in the prosecution‘s case-in-chief during both the guilt and penalty\nphases of the trial, with the exception of the first six minutes of the initial interview and\nthe in-prison questioning of defendant specifically about reenacting the crimes.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f              b) Analysis\n       Defendant advances various arguments in support of the proposition the trial court\nerred in failing to suppress his statements to law enforcement officers and the video\nreenactment as obtained in contravention of his constitutional right against compelled\nself-incrimination. None of these arguments are persuasive.\n\n                  (1) Alleged deliberate violation of Miranda\n       Defendant argues his custodial statements should have been suppressed because\nthey were obtained after a deliberate violation of Miranda, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. This\ndeliberate violation allegedly occurred when, during the first interview, Detectives\nNottingham and Ortiz intentionally declined to seek an express waiver of defendant‘s\nright to silence after giving the Miranda advisement.\n       In general, if a custodial suspect, having heard and understood a full explanation\nof his or her Miranda rights, then makes an uncompelled and uncoerced decision to talk,\nhe or she has thereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived them. (Colorado\nv. Spring (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111798\"><a href=\"/opinion/111798/colorado-v-spring/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574.) Law enforcement officers are not required to obtain\nan express waiver of a suspect‘s Miranda rights prior to a custodial interview. (See\nNorth Carolina v. Butler (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110065\"><a href=\"/opinion/110065/north-carolina-v-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373 (Butler) [―An express written or oral\nstatement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong\nproof of the validity of that waiver, but is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to\nestablish waiver.‖].) Rather, a valid waiver of Miranda rights may, as here, be inferred\nfrom the defendant‘s words and actions. (Butler, at p. 373.) As the detectives who\ninterrogated defendant were not required to obtain an express waiver of the right to\nsilence from him, the intentional failure to do so was not a deliberate Miranda violation\nrequiring the suppression of his subsequent statements.\n\n                  (2) Alleged coercion of defendant’s custodial statements\n       Alternatively, defendant contends his incriminating custodial statements were\ninvoluntary in light of a combination of other factors, including his compromised mental\n                                              34\n\fstate, the detectives‘ use of deception, and their implied promise to help his companion,\nCostello.\n       The test for the voluntariness of a custodial statement is whether the statement is\n― ‗the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice‘ ‖ or whether the\ndefendant‘s ― ‗will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically\nimpaired‘ ‖ by coercion.

Defendant‘s\npre-interview decision is the sole reason appearing in the record for his cooperation. It\n                                             36\n\fthus does not appear the detectives‘ alleged attempts at softening up defendant overcame\nhis will to resist or his ability to freely determine whether he wanted to talk to the\ndetectives, such that it could be said the short discussion regarding Costello was the\nproximate cause of defendant‘s later incriminating statements.\n       We further note neither the length nor physical circumstances of the interrogation\nappear to have been coercive; the initial interview was spread over a four-hour period\nwith the detectives offering defendant both food and drink. Nor was the tone of the\nquestioning as evidenced in the transcript particularly harsh or accusatory.\n       Additionally, at the time of the interview, defendant was ―a man of mature years\nwith an extensive criminal history.‖ (Jablonski, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 815.) In his 42\nyears, he had had extensive prior contacts with law enforcement and the criminal justice\nsystem, including having served two prior prison terms and one prior county jail term. In\nconnection with his felony convictions, defendant twice had been interviewed by law\nenforcement officers, during which he was advised of and executed express written\nwaivers of his Miranda rights.\n       Finally, with respect to defendant‘s mental state, it does not appear the detectives\nexploited any psychiatric problems in order to produce the incriminating statements.\nBefore interviewing him, the detectives inquired about defendant‘s general welfare and\nmental state, and in response he expressed no concerns regarding his well-being or\ntreatment, stating he had slept 24 hours straight.\n       Defendant nevertheless argues his soft-spoken nature, various references to\ndreams and experiences in the Vietnam War, and ―consistently vague‖ responses\ndemonstrate his fragile mental state during the interview. We disagree. A fair\nassessment of the interview in its entirety shows defendant responded to the detectives‘\ninquiries while exhibiting normal emotions to be expected of a murder suspect facing his\naccusers and reliving the details of a horrible crime. That a murder suspect is soft-spoken\nis less an indication of mental illness than an understandable and expected reaction of a\n                                              37\n\fperson confronted with committing such horrendous crimes. Nor does the circumstance\ndefendant may have dreamed about the homicides and their likely ramifications\nnecessarily show the existence of mental defect. Although he became emotional at times,\ndefendant also took considerable time to weigh his responses before answering the\ndetectives‘ questions. Some answers may have required clarification, but they were\ngenerally responsive. We note the detectives believed the references to Vietnam were\ndefendant‘s attempt to build a defense.\n       Lastly, defendant‘s incriminating statements were not rendered involuntary by any\nmental disease or defect. Even if some of defendant‘s behavior was irrational or bizarre,\nthere is no evidence his ―abilities to reason or comprehend or resist were in fact so\ndisabled that he was incapable of free or rational choice.‖ (In re Cameron (1968) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498; see, e.g., People v.

We again note defendant had extensive prior contacts with the police,\nincluding two interviews in which he expressly waived his right to counsel. The\ndetectives in this case ―could reasonably have assumed that defendant was capable of\nmaking an unequivocal request for counsel if he so desired.‖ (Gonzalez, supra, 34\nCal.4th at p. 1127.) Moreover, after defendant‘s question and before the resumption of\nquestioning, defendant was again advised of his Miranda rights, expressly stated he\nunderstood them, and continued to talk to the detectives rather than invoke his right to\ncounsel or to silence. Later in the interview, defendant specifically confirmed the intent\nto waive his right to counsel when he stated he did not want to fight the case, did not need\na lawyer, did not ―believe in the routine of lawyers, or courts and all that,‖ and did not\nfeel a lawyer could do anything for him.\n       Considering the totality of the circumstances, ―[s]hould I have somebody here\ntalking for me‖ was not an unambiguous request for counsel requiring detectives to cease\ninterrogating defendant.

First, relying on People v. Bonillas (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and People v.

Bonillas and Thompson, however, involved defendants\nwho had been arrested for the crimes that later formed the basis for their arraignments.\n(See Bonillas, at p. 787; Thompson, at p. 328.) In this case, defendant was arrested in\nSouth Dakota and returned to Folsom Prison for a parole violation unrelated to the SOS\ncrimes. No arrest warrant for the SOS homicides had issued before the reenactment.\nAccordingly, Bonillas and Thompson are inapposite.\n       In the alternative, defendant argues his Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached\nwhen he became the focus of the SOS investigation and the delay violated his right to\ncounsel regardless of the fact he was arrested and confined for a parole violation.\nHowever, ―[a] criminal defendant‘s right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth\nAmendment does not exist until the state initiates adversary judicial criminal\nproceedings, such as by formal charge or indictment.‖ (People v. DePriest (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2517841\"><a href=\"/opinion/2517841/people-v-depriest/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (DePriest); see Frye, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 987; see also People v.\n\n\n                                            41\n\fHuggins (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575903\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575903/people-v-huggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244–245.) Moreover, the ―right to counsel is ‗offense\nspecific‘ ‖ and ―may be asserted only as to those offenses for which criminal proceedings\nhave formally begun.‖ (DePriest, supra, at p. 33; People v. Webb (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1122530\"><a href=\"/opinion/1122530/people-v-webb/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n527.) Before the reenactment, there were no adversarial judicial proceedings, formal\ncharges, or indictment pending in connection with the SOS crimes. Thus, defendant‘s\nright to the assistance of counsel for those offenses had not attached at the time of the\nreenactment.\n       Defendant relies on Escobedo v. Illinois (1964) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106883\"><a href=\"/opinion/106883/escobedo-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490–491 to argue\nthe right to counsel attached when he became the focus of the detectives‘ investigation.\nDefendant‘s reliance on Escobedo is misplaced. As we have previously explained, the\nhigh court has made clear the right to counsel at issue there was related to the Fifth\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination and prophylactic measures available to\nsuspects undergoing custodial interrogation, and not the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel. (DePriest, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 34, fn. 9.) Moreover, the ―focus‖ rule\ndefendant urges that might once have applied in the context of the right against self-\nincrimination, has since been repudiated. (See, e.g., Stansbury v. California (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117843\"><a href=\"/opinion/117843/stansbury-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326.)\n       Finally, defendant claims the reenactment should have been suppressed because\nhis cooperation was improperly induced by Sergeant Lewis‘s ―promise‖ that he would be\ntransferred out of Folsom Prison. The record belies this claim. As the trial court found,\nLewis simply asked defendant whether he was willing to cooperate with an ongoing\ninvestigation and if so, detectives would be picking him up that weekend. Despite\ndefendant‘s concerns about being placed in administrative segregation and a high security\nunit, Lewis specifically testified that no promises concerning defendant‘s housing\nsituation at the prison were made to induce his cooperation. Additionally, any prior\nsoftening up regarding Costello that might have occurred during the initial interview was\n\n\n                                             42\n\fnot a factor at the time of the reenactment, as Costello had long been cleared of any\nsuspected wrongdoing. The reenactment thus was properly admitted.\n\n          6. Cumulative prejudice\n       Defendant contends that even if the alleged errors at the guilt phase of the trial\nwere individually harmless, they were cumulatively prejudicial. We have found a single\nerror, a violation of defendant‘s statutory right to be present, and, assuming the issue was\nnot forfeited, concluded that error was harmless. There are no additional errors to\ncumulate and therefore no cumulative prejudice.\n\n       B. Penalty Phase Issues\n\n          1. Jury selection issues\n\n              a) Exclusion of Hispanic jurors from the penalty phase jury.\n       Defendant alleges that the jury selection procedures utilized in the Rancho\nCucamonga District of the San Bernardino County Superior Court systematically\nexcluded Hispanics and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the jury\nvenire. As a result, he contends, his penalty phase jury was not composed of a\nrepresentative cross-section of the community, depriving him of his right to due process\nand a fair trial before an impartial jury in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution and article I, section 16 of the California\nConstitution. The error, he argues, is structural, requiring automatic reversal.\n       We conclude the trial court did not err in denying defendant‘s motion to quash, as\ndefendant failed to make a prima facie showing of the systematic exclusion of Hispanic\njurors. This claim therefore is without merit.\n\n                  (1) Background\n       During penalty phase jury selection, defendant filed a motion to quash the jury\npanel on the ground Hispanics were systematically excluded from those summoned for\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\fservice in the Rancho Cucamonga District. The trial court conducted a hearing on the\nmotion, in which the following evidence was presented.\n       Shirley Stoudt, the Deputy Jury Commissioner of San Bernardino County Superior\nCourt, testified concerning how potential jurors were summoned from a master list\ncompiled from Department of Motor Vehicles and Registrar of Voters records, and then\nprocessed according to statutory exemptions as well as the California Rules of Court.\nThe jury commissioner‘s office was not aware of the race, religion, or ethnic background\nof the jurors when excusing or exempting them for service and, according to Stoudt, did\nnothing to keep any minority group off the jury panels. A voluntary countywide survey\nof potential jurors showed 4.3 percent were excused for language difficulties and 1.78\npercent were excused for lack of citizenship. Although these figures included all\nlanguages and noncitizens and the individuals were not asked to state their ethnic or\nracial background, she estimated that Hispanics and Spanish-speaking individuals would\nhave constituted a larger percentage of these groups than other ethnicities.\n       Julia Arias, a politically active elementary school teacher and community leader\nwho grew up in Fontana and Rancho Cucamonga, testified concerning her childhood,\neducation, and religious upbringing and the racial discrimination her family faced.4 Arias\nfelt Hispanics were underrepresented on juries because they were forced to refuse jury\nservice in order to preserve their ―meager pay‖ and because they were unaware of the\nimportance of exercising their right to vote. She then read various statistics from the\nWeeks study (discussed below) and suggested the court read the survey ―more carefully‖\nto find out what was happening to her community. John Weeks, Ph.D.,5 was retained by\n\n\n4      The trial court permitted Arias to give a narrative statement rather than respond to\nquestions from defense counsel.\n\n5     A professor of geography and director of the International Population Center at\nSan Diego State University, Weeks had previously qualified as an expert witness in\ndemography and statistics in more than 50 cases.\n                                            44\n\fthe defense to conduct a demographic survey of jurors reporting for jury duty in San\nBernardino County. Of 574 potential jurors for the Rancho Cucamonga District surveyed\nover the course of five weeks, 16.9 percent indicated they were Hispanic. Weeks\ncompared this to the 23.1 percent he estimated to be Hispanics in the ―juror eligible‖\npopulation in the Rancho Cucamonga District in 1995. Weeks geometrically\nextrapolated the 23.1 percent figure from 1980 and 1990 census data and from\nprojections of the ethnic makeup of every county in the state for 2000 and 2010 by the\nCalifornia Department of Finance, Demographic Research Unit. Based on these figures,\nWeeks found there was an ―absolute disparity‖6 of 6.2 percent between the number of\nHispanics reporting for jury duty and the number of eligible Hispanics residing in the\njudicial district. Dividing the absolute disparity of 6.2 percent by the community percent\nof 23.1, he concluded there was a ―relative disparity‖7 of 27 percent. Thus, according to\nWeeks, there were 27 percent fewer Hispanics in the Rancho Cucamonga jury pool than\nwould be expected from the demographics of the community. Dividing the results by\ngender, he further found an absolute disparity of 7.2 percent and relative disparity of 30\npercent for male Hispanics.8\n\n\n6      ― ‗Absolute disparity‘ is the difference between the underrepresented group‘s\npercentage in the jury-eligible population and the group‘s percentage in the actual jury\nvenire.‖ (People v. Anderson (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623304\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623304/people-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564, fn. 6 (Anderson).)\n\n7       Relative or ― ‗comparative disparity‘ measures the percentage by which the\nnumber of group members in the actual venire falls short of the number of group\nmembers one would expect from the overall ‗eligible population‘ ‖ of the group who are\neligible for jury service. (Anderson, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 564, fn. 6; People v. Ramirez\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600470\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600470/people-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441 (Ramirez); People v.

In this case, 6.2 percent divided by 23.1 percent is 26.8 percent.\n\n8      However, Weeks admitted on cross-examination that based solely on 1990 census\ndata, Hispanics comprised 18.7 percent of the jury-eligible population, which translated\nto an absolute disparity of Hispanic jurors of only 1.8 percent and a relative disparity of\n10 percent.\n                                            45\n\f        Relying on the above disparities, Weeks concluded there was ―a substantive and a\nstatistically significant underrepresentation of Hispanics showing up for jury duty in the\nRancho Cucamonga District courthouse.‖ The biggest alleged cause of the disparity was\nlack of follow-up by the jury commissioner‘s office for unserved jury summonses.\nWeeks also criticized the summons form for stating ―do not forward,‖ for prominently\ninviting excusal requests, and for not explicitly asking for address corrections. He\nbelieved this disadvantaged Hispanics who were more ―residentially mobile‖ than non-\nHispanics. Based on Weeks‘s opinions, defendant argued the court could end the\nsystematic discrimination and disenfranchisement of Hispanics in San Bernardino County\nby prohibiting the removal of jurors except for the reasons authorized under Code of\nCivil Procedure section 203,9 by preventing jury clerks from removing jurors without\njudicial authorization, and by taking measures to ensure adequate follow-up of jurors who\ninitially fail to appear for jury service. Weeks claimed that San Diego County had made\n―some remedies‖ in this regard, which increased the number of Hispanics on its master\nlist.\n        The trial court denied defendant‘s motion to quash the jury venire, ruling there\nwas no underrepresentation of Hispanics by significant numbers due to systematic\nexclusion in the jury selection process.\n\n9      Code of Civil Procedure section 203, subdivision (a), provides in part: ―All\npersons are eligible and qualified to be prospective trial jurors, except the following:\n       ―(1) Persons who are not citizens of the United States.\n       ―(2) Persons who are less than 18 years of age.\n       ―(3) Persons who are not domiciliaries of the State of California . . . .\n       ―(4) Persons who are not residents of the jurisdiction wherein they are summoned\nto serve.\n       ―(5) Persons who have been convicted of malfeasance in office or a felony, and\nwhose civil rights have not been restored.\n       ―(6) Persons who are not possessed of sufficient knowledge of the English\nlanguage . . . .\n       ―(7) Persons who are serving as grand or trial jurors in any court of this state.\n       ―(8) Persons who are the subject of conservatorship.‖\n                                             46\n\f                  (2) Analysis\n       ―In order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement,\nthe defendant must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a ‗distinctive‘ group\nin the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries\nare selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the\ncommunity; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the\ngroup in the jury-selection process.‖ (Duren v. Missouri (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364.)\nDefendant ―satisfied the first prong of this test, because Hispanics are a ‗distinctive‘ or\ncognizable group.‖ (Ramirez, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 445; see Castaneda v.

With respect to the second prong, however, he failed to show\nthe representation of Hispanic jurors was unfair and unreasonable compared to their\nnumbers in the community.\n       Respondent contends the most reliable figures provided by defense expert Weeks,\nbased solely on 1990 census data, demonstrated an absolute disparity of Hispanic jurors\nof only 1.8 percent and a relative disparity of only 10 percent. But even assuming the\nstatistical disparities Weeks calculated based on extrapolations for 1995 were credible—\nan absolute disparity of 6.2 percent and a relative disparity of 27 percent for all\nHispanics, and an absolute disparity of 7.2 percent and relative disparity of 30 percent for\nmale Hispanics—defendant still failed to satisfy the second prong because such\ndisparities are not constitutionally significant.

(b) [a master jury list assembled from\nlists of registered voters and driver‘s license holders, ―when substantially purged of\nduplicate names, shall be considered inclusive of a representative cross section of the\npopulation‖].) There is no suggestion that the master list was duplicative in any way.\n       As shown by the jury commissioner‘s testimony, moreover, juror excusals were\nbased on race-neutral reasons provided by statute and the California Rules of Court.\nIndeed, the excusal forms did not even indicate the prospective juror‘s race. The excusal\ncategories of non-citizenship and lack of understanding of English encompassed all\nethnicities and national origins, not simply Hispanics or Spanish-speaking individuals.\n―Where, as here, a county‘s jury selection criteria are neutral with respect to the\ndistinctive group, the defendant must identify some aspect of the manner in which those\ncriteria are applied that is not only the probable cause of the disparity but also\nconstitutionally impermissible.‖ (Burgener, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 858; see Sanders,\nsupra, 51 Cal.3d at pp. 492–493 [―Evidence that ‗race/class neutral jury selection\nprocesses may nonetheless operate to permit the de facto exclusion of a higher percentage\n                                              48\n\fof a particular class of jurors than would result from a random draw‘ is insufficient to\nmake out a prima facie case.‖].) Defendant failed to do so in this case.\n       Julia Arias, the community activist who testified for the defense, suggested\nHispanics were underrepresented because they were unaware of the importance of voting.\nHowever, ―the failure of a particular group to register to vote in proportion to its share of\nthe population cannot constitute improper exclusion attributable to the state.‖ (Ochoa,\nsupra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 427.) Arias also speculated Hispanics were forced to refuse jury\nservice in order to avoid losing the ―meager pay‖ they received in their employment.\nAnd defense expert John Weeks suggested, without citation to evidence, that Hispanics in\nRancho Cucamonga were ―residentially mobile‖ because they had low incomes, were\nunlikely to own homes and were transient as renters, and consequently more difficult to\nsummon for jury duty. However, ―[s]peculation as to the source of the disparity is\ninsufficient to show systematic exclusion [citation], as is evidence the disparity is\nunlikely to be a product of chance [citation] or has endured for some time [citation].‖\n(Burgener, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 858.)\n       Finally, Weeks opined San Bernardino County could have remedied the alleged\ndisparity in Hispanic jurors by following up on unserved summonses, soliciting address\ncorrections, and making the excusal form less prominent. Even assuming he was correct,\nmerely pointing to a remedy is not enough. (Ochoa, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 428.) The\nUnited States Constitution, while forbidding the exclusion of members of a cognizable\nclass of jurors, ― ‗ ―does not require that venires created by a neutral selection procedure\nbe supplemented to achieve the goal of selection from a representative cross-section of\nthe population.‖ ‘ [Citation.] So long as the state uses criteria that are neutral with\nrespect to the underrepresented group, the state‘s failure to adopt other measures to\nincrease the group‘s representation cannot satisfy Duren‘s third prong.‖ (Burgener,\nsupra, 29 Cal.4th at pp. 857–858.)\n\n\n                                             49\n\f       As defendant did not satisfy his burden under the second and third prongs of\nDuren, a prima facie case of underrepresentation and systematic exclusion of Hispanic\njurors was not made. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant‘s motion to\nquash the venire.\n\n              b) Exclusion of life-inclined juror for cause\n       Defendant claims the trial court erroneously excluded Prospective Juror G.P. for\ncause based solely on his written answers to a jury questionnaire and without any\nopportunity for voir dire. He contends that if G.P. had been given the opportunity to\nrespond to questions in person, the court could have clarified whether he was qualified to\nserve on a capital jury. As a result of the allegedly improper removal of this prospective\njuror, defendant argues he was subjected to ―a tribunal organized to return a verdict of\ndeath‖ in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution and article I, sections 15 and 16 of the California Constitution.\n       To the extent defendant asserts error in the court‘s ruling on challenges for cause\nbased solely on the jurors‘ responses to the questionnaires without voir dire, the claim is\nforfeited because he stipulated to this procedure. On the merits, we conclude the court\ndid not err in excusing Prospective Juror G.P. for cause based on his juror questionnaire,\nin which he stated an inability to impose the death penalty in a contested penalty phase.\n\n                    (1) Background\n       Before jury selection for the penalty phase, defendant moved for sequestered voir\ndire of prospective jurors.10 The trial court denied the request for individual voir dire of\nall jurors but acknowledged that oral or questionnaire responses might warrant\nsequestered voir dire of particular jurors on particular issues.\n\n\n\n10      Code of Civil Procedure section 223 provides that ―[v]oir dire of any prospective\njurors shall, where practicable, occur in the presence of the other jurors in all criminal\ncases, including death penalty cases.‖\n                                              50\n\f       Thereafter, the trial court proposed ruling on stipulated dismissals, followed by\nchallenges for cause based solely on questionnaire responses, noting that denial of any\nchallenge would be without prejudice, allowing counsel the opportunity to individually\nquestion the juror. ―Regular‖ voir dire would then be conducted on the rest of the panel.\nDefense counsel endorsed this procedure as ―the next best thing‖ to sequestered voir dire\nof the entire jury panel and commented on ―[t]he beauty of the Court‘s procedure‖ in\nprotecting against potential jurors who may ―pollute the panel.‖ As the time for jury\nselection neared, defendant personally appeared in court and expressly agreed to this\nprocedure, which the court, pursuant to the parties‘ stipulation, then utilized.\n       Both the prosecution and defense moved to exclude for cause various prospective\njurors solely on the basis of their questionnaire responses. Prospective Juror G.P. was\namong those whom the prosecutor challenged. In his questionnaire, when asked whether\nhe had ―any philosophical, religious, or moral feelings that would make it difficult or\nimpossible for you to sit in judgment of another person,‖ G.P. wrote ―being educated and\nraised in the strict Catholic teachings and standards, I find it hard to be a judge of another\nperson. I was taught that God is the only rightful judge.‖ Although he also wrote, ―I\nhave no problem in judging as to whether or not a person is guilty or has done wrong,‖ he\nindicated that he did ―have a problem as to whether or not punishment or appropriate\npunishment is right or wrong.‖ Despite his generally enjoying jury service ―because the\nlaw has always been fascinating‖ to him, G.P. reiterated, ―[i]t just so happens that\nsentencing someone is against my beliefs.‖\n       Prospective Juror G.P. further wrote he would be greatly influenced by the\nCatholic Church‘s opposition to the death penalty, writing ―I have always been taught to\ntry to understand why people become the way they are and that one might always forgive\nand that one might never lose hope. Somehow these teachings have become my own and\nhave influenced my decision in life.‖ G.P. reaffirmed he ―strongly‖ opposed the death\npenalty, opining it served only an economic purpose and was part of a system that ―has\n                                             51\n\flost all hope. That should not be the case in any system.‖ When asked ―what types of\ncrime, if any, deserve the death penalty,‖ he answered, ―I couldn‘t think of one.‖ G.P.\nalso wrote life in prison without parole served no purpose other than draining the\neconomy and he would ―only agree to it if it is the only solution for a person not to\ncommit harm to society again.‖\n       Prospective Juror G.P. indicated he would ―have to hear the case first‖ to know\nwhether he could impose life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. He\nalso stated it was ―very possible‖ to see himself rejecting the death penalty and choosing\nlife without possibility of parole ―because of my beliefs,‖ but rejecting life without the\npossibility of parole and choosing the death penalty was ―a possibility‖ only if the\ndefendant ―himself requests it and if he is sound in mind and body.‖\n       The defense argued that although Prospective Juror G.P. expressed a preference\nfor life without the possibility of parole, his responses also indicated he would be willing\nto listen to the case before selecting a punishment. The prosecution responded that G.P.‘s\nanswers demonstrated his religious beliefs, which taught him the death penalty was\nimproper, would override this willingness. Defense counsel did not ask to question G.P.\nin order to clarify his qualification to serve on a capital jury. Without conducting voir\ndire of G.P., the court granted the challenge for cause, finding his strong religious beliefs\ncombined with his strong opposition to the death penalty indicated he would be\n―substantially impaired in seriously considering the death penalty as an option.‖\n\n                  (2) Analysis\n       Defendant argues the trial court erred in failing to conduct voir dire to clarify\nProspective Juror G.P.‘s views on capital punishment and in granting the prosecutor‘s\nchallenge based on his juror questionnaire responses alone. However, defendant forfeited\nthis claim when he expressly agreed to that procedure. Defendant, moreover, did not\nrequest individual voir dire of Prospective Juror G.P. before the court ruled on the\n\n\n                                             52\n\fprosecutor‘s challenge for cause, instead opposing the challenge by arguing that G.P.‘s\nquestionnaire responses indicated he could be a fair juror.

(People v. Avila\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515784\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515784/people-v-avila/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (Avila).) We review the record to determine whether the trial\ncourt had sufficient information regarding Prospective Juror G.P.‘s state of mind to\npermit it to reliably determine whether his views on the death penalty would prevent or\nsubstantially impair the performance of his duties in this case. (Stewart, supra, 33\nCal.4th at p. 445; see also Avila, at p. 531 [―a prospective juror in a capital case may be\ndischarged for cause based solely on his or her answers to the written questionnaire if it is\nclear from the answers that he or she is unwilling to temporarily set aside his or her own\nbeliefs and follow the law‖].)\n       In Cook, supra, 40 Cal.4th at pages 1343–1344, and Avila, supra, 38 Cal.4th at\npage 532, we upheld the trial court‘s orders excusing prospective jurors whose\nquestionnaire answers showed they could not impose the death penalty even though they\nalso responded they could set aside their personal feelings and follow the law. The\nsituation before us presents a similar dichotomy.\n       In his questionnaire, Prospective Juror G.P. stated he had strong religious beliefs\nthat made it difficult for him to judge someone else because he was taught God is the\nonly rightful judge, and although he had no problem judging another person on the issue\nof guilt, he had a problem with deciding the appropriate punishment. Significantly, G.P.\nstated unequivocally he was strongly opposed to the death penalty, which he saw as\neconomically motivated and as part of a system that had ―lost all hope,‖ and he could not\nthink of a single crime deserving the death penalty. Although G.P. stated it was a\n―possibility‖ he could choose the death penalty in an appropriate case, the example he\ngave was a case in which the defendant was competent and requested it. However, in\nanother response, G.P. implied he would not make up his mind on punishment until he\nheard the case.\n\n\n                                             54\n\f       We conclude Prospective Juror G.P.‘s strong religious beliefs and opposition to\ncapital punishment amply support the conclusion he would have been prevented or\nsubstantially impaired from performing his duties in this particular case. His express\nreluctance to sit in judgment of someone on the issue of punishment made him\nparticularly unqualified to serve on defendant‘s jury, as G.P. was being considered for\nservice on a penalty phase jury that would only be deciding the appropriate punishment\nfor defendant. Although stating somewhat ambiguously he would have to hear the case\nfirst to know whether he could realistically impose either death or life without the\npossibility of parole, G.P. repeatedly expressed his opposition to the death penalty for all\ncrimes, with a possible exception for a case in which a competent defendant exercised his\nright to a jury trial in order to request to be executed. The trial court therefore did not err\nby excusing Prospective Juror G.P. for cause based on his responses to the jury\nquestionnaire.\n\n              c) Prosecutor’s use of peremptory challenges to strike African-American\n                 jurors\n       Defendant claims the prosecutor improperly exercised four of his six peremptory\nchallenges against African-Americans—Prospective Jurors D.W., A.L., S.A.-M., and\nA.C.—during penalty phase jury selection. (See Batson v. Kentucky (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\nPeople v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d. 258 (Wheeler).) He argues the trial court erred in\nfailing to find a prima facie case of discrimination based on the four challenges and\nabdicated its duty to conduct a sincere evaluation of the prosecutor‘s reasons for excusing\nthose potential jurors. Their improper removal, he contends, requires automatic reversal\nof the judgment.\n       This claim fails for several reasons. First, defendant failed to make a sufficient\nrecord demonstrating Prospective Juror A.L. was a member of a cognizable class.\nSecond, defendant forfeited any Batson/Wheeler claim regarding Prospective Jurors S.A.-\nM. and A.C. by failing to object to their excusal prior to the swearing of the jury and\n\n                                              55\n\falternates. Finally, as to Prospective Juror D.W., the trial court correctly ruled defendant\nfailed to make a prima facie showing the prosecutor excused the juror for reasons of race.\n\n                 (1) Background\n       After the prosecutor exercised his first peremptory challenge against a non-\nAfrican-American juror, defense counsel made a premature Batson/Wheeler motion. He\nargued prospectively that if the prosecutor were to exercise a peremptory challenge\nagainst any African-American jurors, a prima facie case of discrimination would be\nestablished because (1) of the prosecutor‘s six for-cause challenges denied by the court,\n―approximately [50] percent of those persons were [B]lack,‖ and (2) the prosecutor had\ndevoted an inordinate amount of time—approximately 75 to 80 percent of the voir dire\ntranscript pages—questioning African-American jurors.11 The prosecutor objected to\nwhat he considered defense counsel‘s attempts to intimidate him in his exercise of\nperemptory challenges. After additional discussion, the court found, considering the\nexplanations offered for the prosecutor‘s challenges for cause to minority and non-\nminority jurors, there had been no attempt to systematically exclude minority jurors.\n       After voir dire continued, the prosecutor exercised his second peremptory\nchallenge against Prospective Juror D.W. Defense counsel objected: ―Batson challenge.\nShe‘s a correctional officer. She was one he picked on for no good reason just to ask a\nlot of questions.‖ The trial court denied the challenge, concluding defendant had not\nmade a prima facie showing of a systematic pattern of exclusion of minority jurors. It\ninvited the prosecutor to place his reasons for exercising the challenge on the record,\nnoting, however, he was under no obligation to do so. The prosecutor declined the\ninvitation, stating he would provide an explanation for each minority juror for whom he\n\n\n\n11     Defense counsel did not restrict his Batson/Wheeler objections to African-\nAmericans or other racial groups. He also filed a written Batson/Wheeler motion arguing\nthat Vietnam veterans were a cognizable class.\n                                             56\n\fexercised a peremptory challenge at the end of jury selection. The court thereafter\nexcused D.W.\n       The prosecutor exercised his third peremptory challenge against Prospective Juror\nA.L. Defense counsel objected: ―Batson again.‖ The court excused A.L. without\nexplicitly ruling on defendant‘s challenge.\n       The prosecutor exercised his fourth peremptory challenge against Prospective\nJuror S.A.-M. Defense counsel stated: ―I‘ll wait till he does one more, then I‘ll do that.\nI‘m going to make a motion. So we don‘t have to argue it each time.‖ The trial court\nresponded: ―All right. For the record, the court notes that there was a challenge for\ncause as to [S.A.-M.] and she did indicate an attitude that was definitely leaning against\nthe death penalty, although probably not sufficient, the court found, to grant a challenge\nfor cause. But certainly it‘s a basis for an exercise of the peremptory challenge.‖\n       The prosecutor exercised his fifth challenge against Prospective Juror A.C.\nDefense counsel made no objection, and the trial court excused A.C. Subsequently, the\nparties accepted 12 jurors after the prosecutor exercised his sixth and final peremptory\nchallenge without any further Batson/Wheeler objections. During the selection of the\nalternate jurors, the defendant made no Batson/Wheeler objections. Thereafter, six\nalternate jurors were chosen.\n       After the jurors and alternate jurors were sworn, the prosecutor asked whether\nthere was a Batson/Wheeler motion still pending. The trial court and defense counsel\nindicated it had been denied, referring to the colloquy that occurred in connection with\nProspective Juror D.W. The prosecutor, defense counsel, and the court all noted the\nprosecution thereafter had exercised peremptory challenges against two other African-\nAmerican prospective jurors, S.A.-M. and A.C. Defense counsel then stated, ―I don‘t\nbelieve I said anything when he did that. The court confirmed, ―Correct. You didn‘t\nrenew or make another motion.‖ Defense counsel affirmed, ―I had made the motion.\n\n\n                                              57\n\fYou had denied it. And I guess the reasons for my not doing it again will have to go with\nme to the federal habeas or whatever.‖\n       The prosecutor then asked for the opportunity to ―go on the record‖ regarding the\nthree challenges. The trial court granted this request, but first stated: ―[E]ven after the\ntwo additional challenges[,] the Court is still satisfied that there is not a . . . prima facie\ndemonstration to the Court of any systematic or attempted systematic exclusion of\n[B]lack jurors by the prosecution, particularly with regard to the last two peremptories of\n[B]lack jurors. [¶] The responses in the questionnaire, and the responses of the jurors\norally, in the Court‘s view, provided adequate non-racial basis for the peremptory\nchallenges. And if the motion had been renewed, it would have been denied again at that\npoint, again on the basis that there was not a prima facie showing. [¶] [The c]ourt will\nalso note that the jury that the prosecution passed on that was actually sworn does include\ntwo [B]lack jurors. Which is, again, additional evidence to the Court that there was not\nan attempt to systematically exclude [B]lacks.‖12\n       Thereafter, the prosecutor explained he excused Prospective Juror D.W. because\nshe was argumentative during voir dire and had used defensive body language.

And when the prosecutor asked D.W. about rolling her eyes\nwhile D.P. was speaking during voir dire, D.W. at first admitted to doing so, but then\nlater approached the prosecutor during a break, in violation of a court order not to discuss\nthe case, and told him she was just batting her eyes rather than rolling them. This\nbehavior, coupled with animosity in D.W.‘s voice, concerned the prosecutor.\n       With respect to Prospective Juror A.C., the prosecutor first noted she failed to\nwrite responses to many of the questions regarding her views on the death penalty. She\nfurther expressed ―severe‖ reservations about the death penalty during voir dire and was\n―dishonest‖ in recounting she had heard on the news about a recent execution in\nCalifornia, which never occurred.\n       Finally, concerning Prospective Juror S.A.-M., the prosecutor explained he\nexcused her due to her ―serious reservations about the use of the death penalty.‖\nResponses in the juror questionnaire indicated her religious beliefs taught her not to judge\nothers and she would not consider imposing the death penalty on a combat veteran. She\nalso had a relative who was killed by a deputy sheriff in Los Angeles and her family\nwanted criminal charges brought against the sheriff‘s department. This potential bias\nagainst law enforcement concerned the prosecutor as well. And despite S.A.-M.‘s\nrecognition there were ―probably circumstances where the death penalty could be\nimposed,‖ she wrote she hoped never to be part of such a decision. Such reservations\nabout the death penalty, which were further developed during voir dire, led the prosecutor\nto believe S.A.-M. would not be an appropriate juror for defendant‘s case.\n       Defense counsel did not respond to or comment on the explanations volunteered\nby the prosecutor. Having denied defendant‘s Batson/Wheeler motion regarding\n\nwell as skepticism about two psychological experts evaluating someone over a short time\nand suddenly claiming to know ―what was wrong with this person.‖ D.P. also stated an\nexpert‘s credentials ―doesn‘t mean squat‖ if they have only spent a few hours, days, or\nweeks talking with the person they are evaluating.

In objecting to the prosecutor‘s peremptory\nchallenge of A.L., defense counsel simply stated ―Batson again.‖ Although defendant\nassumes on appeal that A.L. was one of four African-American prospective jurors against\nwhom the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges, the record fails to disclose what\ncognizable class defendant was asserting as the basis for his Batson/Wheeler objection to\nthe peremptory challenge of A.L.\n       It is true, as defendant notes in his reply, his first Batson/Wheeler objection\nconcerned an African-American prospective juror, D.W. But defendant did not provide\nany factual basis for the objection regarding A.L. or make any record as to what\ncognizable class A.L. allegedly belonged to. A.L. was never identified as African-\nAmerican during voir dire, and in fact self-identified as ―Caucasian,‖ ―Danish,‖ and\n―Dane‖ in his jury questionnaire. Nor was A.L. identified as African-American in any of\nthe Batson/Wheeler discussions contained in the record. To the contrary, in their\ndiscussion following the swearing of the jury, the court, defense counsel, and the\nprosecutor all stated that there had been three African-American prospective jurors\nexcused by the prosecution and identified those three jurors as D.W., S.A-M., and A.C.\nDefense counsel, moreover, did not restrict his Batson/Wheeler motions to racial groups;\nhe also attempted to argue that Vietnam veterans were a cognizable class.

In order to preserve a Batson/Wheeler claim based on the prosecutor‘s\nperemptory challenges, the defendant must make a timely objection.

After the jurors and alternate jurors\nwere sworn and the prosecutor asked whether there was a Batson/Wheeler motion still\npending, defense counsel agreed with the trial court he had not renewed or made new\nBatson/Wheeler motions with respect to S.A.-M. and A.C., stating: ―I guess the reasons\nfor my not doing it again will have to go with me to the federal habeas or whatever.‖\n(Italics added.) Defense counsel also did not discuss or contest the prosecutor‘s\nvolunteered explanations for the two challenges. In light of the lack of a timely, or even\nuntimely, objection, any claim of Batson/Wheeler error regarding Prospective Jurors\nS.A.-M. and A.C. was forfeited.\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\f                      (c) Prospective Juror D.W.\n       Defendant did make a timely, clearly articulated Batson/Wheeler objection with\nrespect to the prosecutor‘s peremptory challenge against Prospective Juror D.W. The\napplicable law is well settled. While a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise\nperemptory challenges for almost any reason at all, ―[b]oth the state and federal\nConstitutions prohibit the use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors\nbased on race . . . .‖ (Bonilla, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 341.)\n       A three-stage procedure applies to the evaluation of Batson/Wheeler motions.\n―First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case ‗by showing that the totality of the\nrelevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.‘ [Citations.] Second,\nonce the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the ‗burden shifts to the State to\nexplain adequately the racial exclusion‘ by offering permissible race-neutral justifications\nfor the strikes. [Citations.] Third, ‗[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial\ncourt must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful\nracial discrimination.‘ ‖ (Johnson v.

Although the prosecutor\nsubsequently volunteered his reasons for challenging D.W., ―the trial court did not\nevaluate the prosecutor‘s stated reasons, either explicitly or implicitly.‖ (People v.\nSattiewhite (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 469.) Rather, the court expressly ruled defendant had\nnot made a prima facie case before the prosecution‘s recitation of reasons and denied the\nBatson/Wheeler motion on this basis. The trial court merely allowed the prosecution ―to\npreserve for the record its reason for those excusals.‖\n       Nevertheless, in finding defendant failed to make a prima facie case of racial\ndiscrimination, the trial court appears to have used an incorrect standard, finding ―no\nsystematic pattern of exclusion,‖ rather than no inference of discriminatory purpose.\n(See, e.g., Avila, supra, 38 Cal.4th at pp. 554–555 [trial court was under the mistaken\n\n                                              62\n\fimpression that only pattern of discrimination through multiple excusals could make\nprima facie showing].) We therefore independently review the record to ― ‗resolve the\nlegal question whether the record supports an inference that the prosecutor excused a\njuror on the basis of race.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 554.)\n       Certain types of evidence are relevant in determining whether a defendant has\ncarried his burden of showing an inference of discriminatory excusal, such as whether the\nprosecutor ―struck most or all of the members of the identified group from the venire or\nused a disproportionate number of his peremptories against the group,‖ whether the\nexcused jurors had little in common other than their membership in the group, and\nwhether the prosecutor engaged in ―desultory voir dire‖ or no questioning at all.\n(Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at pp. 280–281.) Although a ―defendant need not be a\nmember of the excluded group,‖ it is significant if he is and if, in addition, his victims are\nmembers of the group to which the majority of the remaining jurors belong.

The record\ndoes not support defendant‘s claim. In selecting a jury for the penalty phase, the\nprosecutor exercised a total of eight peremptory challenges to potential jurors—six\nduring the selection of the 12 jurors and two during the selection of the six alternate\njurors—only three of which were used to remove African-Americans D.W., S.A.-M., and\nA.C. As noted, the record does not support defendant‘s contention that Prospective Juror\nA.L. was African-American.\n       The prosecutor, moreover, passed two African-American prospective jurors who\nultimately were seated on the jury.

Indeed, defendant complains that no juror was publicly\nquestioned by the prosecution ―more relentlessly‖ than D.W. However, the thoroughness\nof the prosecutor‘s probing of D.W. was not outside the norm and does not support an\ninference of racial bias.\n       We discern at least one race-neutral reason for excusing Prospective Juror D.W.\nthat is ―apparent from and ‗clearly established‘ in the record.‖ (People v. Scott (June 8,\n2015, S064858) __ Cal.4th __ [at p. 20].) The defense case for the penalty phase would\nrely heavily on psychological testimony concerning PTSD resulting from defendant‘s\nabusive childhood and experiences in Vietnam. Not only did D.W. express a strong\nreceptivity toward such testimony, stating such experts ―would be necessary,‖ she also\nindicated she wanted to ―lateral over into prison counseling.‖ This was a legitimate race-\nneutral reason for excusing D.W. (See, e.g., Avila, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 556 [a juror\nwho indicated she worked closely with psychologists and psychiatrists as a nurse in a\npsychiatric ward and valued their opinions provided a reason other than racial bias for the\nprosecutor‘s challenge]; People v.

The trial court therefore did not err in\ndenying defendant‘s Batson/Wheeler motion for failure to establish a prima facie case.\n\n\n                                             64\n\f              d) Denial of a continuance prior to jury selection\n       Defendant claims the trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for a\ncontinuance of the penalty phase based on publicity surrounding the April 1995 bombing\nof the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. He contends the denial of this request\ncaused voir dire to be conducted shortly after the bombing in ―an unduly prejudicial\natmosphere‖ and thus violated his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\n       Before the beginning of jury selection in the penalty phase, defendant moved for a\ncontinuance from May until September 1995, arguing there was good cause in light of\n―the difficulty of selecting a fair and impartial jury in this case, due to the interconnection\nof some of the major issues in [defendant‘s] life, and of those persons accused of the\nbombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.‖ He pointed to the circumstance that\nTimothy McVeigh, one of the Oklahoma City bombing suspects, was an army veteran\nwho might also raise a PTSD defense. Defendant also argued future delays might occur\nbecause one of the defense experts was working with trauma victims in Oklahoma City.\nThe trial court, noting among other circumstances that McVeigh had fought in the Gulf\nWar while defendant was a Vietnam War veteran, found no similarities between\ndefendant‘s case and the Oklahoma City bombing. Concluding the events in Oklahoma\nwould have no significant impact on jury selection in this case, the trial court denied\ndefendant‘s request for a continuance.\n       A continuance may be granted only on the moving party‘s showing of good cause.\n(§ 1050, subd. (e).) ―The granting or denial of a motion for continuance rests within the\nsound discretion of the trial court.‖ (People v. Mickey (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1226896\"><a href=\"/opinion/1226896/people-v-mickey/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 660.) In\nlight of the lack of any relationship or similarity between the Oklahoma City bombing\nand defendant‘s case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding there was no\nshowing of good cause for a continuance.\n       The publicity from the Oklahoma City bombing, which differed drastically from\nthe SOS murders in both kind and degree, had no bearing on defendant‘s case. Timothy\n\n                                              65\n\fMcVeigh detonated a 3,000- to 6,000-pound bomb, killing 168 people, including 19\nchildren and eight law enforcement officials. (U. S. v. McVeigh (10th Cir. 1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"156859\"><a href=\"/opinion/156859/united-states-v-mcveigh/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1177.) By comparison, defendant shot and killed three adult victims with\nwhom he was acquainted during the commission of a burglary and robbery of a company\nfor which he once worked. The Oklahoma City bombing was politically motivated with\nthe goal of inciting a general uprising against the government (ibid.), whereas defendant‘s\nmurders were financially motivated. The only concrete common feature argued by\ndefense counsel, that defendant and McVeigh were both Army veterans, does not\nwithstand scrutiny. McVeigh was not a veteran of the Vietnam War, and defendant‘s\njury would hear defense testimony that the Vietnam conflict had many significant\ncharacteristics not present in other conflicts and that generated unique problems for\nVietnam War veterans.\n       Not only were the supposed connections between the cases tenuous at best, the\npossibility of an unavailable witness and the notion that a separate tragedy would have a\nprejudicial effect on a jury trying this case were pure speculation. Moreover, voir dire\nexists exactly to explore issues of prejudice such as these. In sum, the court‘s ruling\nclearly was not manifestly erroneous or arbitrary.\n\n          2. Failure to sua sponte appoint a second attorney\n       Defendant contends the trial court violated his rights under the Sixth and Eighth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California\nConstitution by failing to appoint, sua sponte, a second qualified attorney to assist\ndefense counsel in his case. As defendant acknowledges, ― ‗[t]he appointment of a\nsecond counsel in a capital case is not an absolute right protected by either the state or the\nfederal Constitution.‘ ‖ (People v. Williams (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2543191\"><a href=\"/opinion/2543191/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300.) It is true that\nby statute, California trial courts have the authority to appoint a second attorney to\nrepresent a capital defendant. (§ 987, subd. (d).) However, no sua sponte duty to appoint\n\n\n                                             66\n\fadditional counsel can be derived from a statutory provision granting only discretionary\nauthority to the trial court to do so upon a written request and supporting affidavit by\nprimary counsel. ―Indeed, under the statute, the trial court lacks any specific authority to\nappoint a second attorney in the absence of a request from the first attorney and the\nmaking of a factual record sufficient to support such an appointment. To the extent that\ndefendant‘s argument is that the trial courts have inherent power to appoint a second\nattorney, no authority supporting that proposition is cited.‖ (People v. Padilla (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127353\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127353/people-v-padilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 928.) Accordingly, defendant‘s claim that the court erred in not appointing a\nsecond attorney in the absence of such a request fails.\n\n          3. Admission of photographic and videotape crime scene evidence\n       Defendant claims five photographs of the victims previously admitted in the guilt\nphase, as well as a silent videotape of the crime scene, should have been excluded in the\npenalty phase as irrelevant (see Evid. Code, § 350) and more prejudicial than probative\n(see id., § 352). The photographs depicted the victims‘ bodies as they were found on the\nfloor in the restroom, with close-ups of their bound hands. The video depicted the\nfreeway next to SOS and the SOS parking lot, and a forensic expert walking around the\nbuilding, hallways, and warehouse filming the register on the office desk, the lobby, and\na ceiling-to-floor view of the interior of the women‘s bathroom, including the victims‘\nbodies and at least one bullet casing. Defendant argues the failure to exclude these\nexhibits denied him due process of law under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution and article I, sections 7, 15, 17 and 24 of\nthe California Constitution.\n       As a preliminary matter, defendant has forfeited any claim that three of the five\ncrime scene photographs were erroneously admitted. Although defendant moved to\nexclude five photographs and argued his objection at the hearing, at the time the trial\ncourt formally admitted the challenged evidence defense counsel withdrew his objection\n\n\n                                             67\n\fto one of the photographs and affirmatively stipulated to the admission of two others.\n(See, e.g., People v. Cook (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581358\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581358/people-v-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 609.)\n        With respect to the remaining two photographs and the 30-second portion of the\ncrime scene videotape depicting the victims in the bathroom, the trial court did not abuse\nits discretion by admitting this evidence. ― ‗A trial court‘s decision to admit photographs\nunder Evidence Code section 352 will be upheld on appeal unless the prejudicial effect of\nsuch photographs clearly outweighs their probative value.‘ [Citations.] Notably,\nhowever, the discretion to exclude photographs under Evidence Code section 352 is\nmuch narrower at the penalty phase than at the guilt phase. This is so because the\nprosecution has the right to establish the circumstances of the crime, including its\ngruesome consequences [citation], and because the risk of an improper guilt finding\nbased on visceral reactions is no longer present.‖ (Bonilla, supra, 41 Cal.4th at pp. 353–\n354.)\n        The two crime scene photographs and videotape were relevant to the penalty phase\nof the trial. They show the circumstances of the crime, which included premeditation and\ndeliberation on defendant‘s part as evidenced by his binding the victims‘ hands behind\ntheir backs with duct tape he had bought a week or two before committing the crimes.\nThey further corroborated defendant‘s custodial statements to law enforcement officers,\nincluding that he had shot Smith several more times upon discovering he had broken free\nfrom his bindings (one of the photographs and the videotape depicts broken strands of\nduct tape on Smith‘s wrists). Finally, as in the guilt phase, the forensic pathologist used\nthe photographs to assist the trier of fact in understanding her testimony. The admitted\nphotographs and videotape also were not cumulative; only five photographs and 30\nseconds of videotape were admitted.\n        Nor were the photographs or videotape substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative. ―As we have previously noted, ‗ ―murder is seldom pretty, and pictures,\ntestimony and physical evidence in such a case are always unpleasant.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v.\n                                             68\n\fRoldan (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2546413\"><a href=\"/opinion/2546413/people-v-roldan/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713.) Likewise in this case. But as unpleasant as these\nphotographs and videotape may be, they demonstrate the real-life consequences of\ndefendant‘s actions. The prosecution was entitled to have the penalty phase jury consider\nthose consequences. The trial court‘s exercise of discretion to admit them was neither\nstatutory nor constitutional error.\n\n           4. Denial of automatic application for modification of death verdict\n       Defendant claims the trial court erred in denying his automatic application for\nmodification of the death verdict pursuant to section 190.4, subdivision (e). This claim,\namounting to no more than a disagreement with the trial court‘s assessment of the\nevidence, lacks merit.\n       Section 190.4, subdivision (e), provides for an automatic application for\nmodification of a finding or verdict imposing death in every case in which the jury has\nreturned such a finding or verdict. ―Pursuant to section 190.4, in ruling upon an\napplication for modification of a verdict imposing the death penalty, the trial court must\nreweigh independently the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and\nthen determine whether, in its independent judgment, the weight of the evidence supports\nthe jury‘s verdict.‖ (Crittenden, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 150.) The statute thus requires the\ncourt to make an independent determination concerning the propriety of the death\npenalty. The court must state the reasons for its ruling on the record, but need not\ndescribe every detail supporting its ruling so long as the statement of reasons is sufficient\nto allow meaningful appellate review.

(People v. Abilez\n(2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599854\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599854/people-v-abilez/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (Abilez).)\n       Here, the trial court expressly recognized its duty to independently review and\nreweigh the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine whether\nthe sentence imposed was proportionate to defendant‘s culpability. It reviewed in detail\nthe aggravating and mitigating factors listed in section 190.3. For example, it considered\nin aggravation the circumstances of the crime, including the ―high-degree of cold-\nblooded callousness‖ exhibited by the killings, defendant‘s prior felony convictions,\nincluding the extent to which they involved attempted use of force or violence and\nimplied threats thereof, and defendant‘s maturity and life experiences at the time of the\ncrimes, including his prior prison and parole terms. In mitigation, it considered the lack\nof more numerous acts of violence by defendant in light of his mature age, defendant‘s\ntraumatic childhood, including the physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and\nabandonment he experienced, his decorated service to the country and traumatic war\nexperiences in Vietnam, and the testimony of defendant‘s experts concerning PTSD both\ngenerally and as related to defendant. It ultimately found the weight of the mitigating\ncircumstances had been ―greatly attenuated‖ by the intervening 20 years between\ndefendant‘s service in Vietnam and the SOS crimes, as well as defendant‘s criminal\nconvictions and acts of violence that culminated in the present offenses. The court then\nstated its independent judgment that the circumstances in aggravation outweighed the\ncircumstances in mitigation and the substantial weight of the evidence supported the\njury‘s verdict of death.\n       Defendant essentially argues the trial court erred because it failed to find his\nchildhood problems, Vietnam experiences, and mental health issues to be as significant or\nweighty as it should have. As is apparent, however, ―the trial court applied the correct\nstandard and properly conducted an independent reweighing of the aggravating and\nmitigating evidence. That it did not find defendant‘s proffered mitigating evidence as\n                                             70\n\fpersuasive as he would have liked does not undermine this conclusion.‖ (Abilez, supra,\n41 Cal.4th at p. 530; see Steele, supra, 27 Cal.4th at pp. 1267–1268.) The court‘s refusal\nto modify the verdict is consistent with both the law and the evidence. We therefore\nconclude the trial court properly performed its duty under section 190.4, subdivision (e).\n\n          5. Penalty of death as disproportionate to defendant’s individual\n             culpability\n       Defendant claims his death sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of the state and federal Constitutions because the penalty is grossly\ndisproportionate to his individual culpability in committing the crimes. ― ‗To determine\nwhether a sentence is cruel or unusual as applied to a particular defendant, a reviewing\ncourt must examine the circumstances of the offense, including its motive, the extent of\nthe defendant‘s involvement in the crime, the manner in which the crime was committed,\nand the consequences of the defendant‘s acts. The court must also consider the personal\ncharacteristics of the defendant, including age, prior criminality, and mental capabilities.\n[Citation.] If the court concludes that the penalty imposed is ―grossly disproportionate to\nthe defendant‘s individual culpability‖ [citation], or, stated another way, that the\npunishment ― ‗ ―shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human\ndignity‖ ‘ ‖ [citation], the court must invalidate the sentence as unconstitutional.‘ ‖\n(Steele, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1269.)\n       Defendant received a death sentence for three burglary and robbery murders\ncommitted by him alone, purely for financial gain. Although the three victims\ncooperated fully with defendant‘s demands and offered no resistance, he nevertheless\nshot and killed them one by one. He also had an extensive prior criminal record\nincluding prior prison and jail terms. Defendant attempts to mitigate his personal\nculpability by citing his traumatic childhood and Vietnam War experiences and resulting\nPTSD. We agree with the trial court that these circumstances ultimately did not affect\ndefendant‘s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his\n\n                                             71\n\fconduct to the requirements of the law. Defendant‘s actions at the time of the murders\nshowed a rational, logical, intelligent, and calculated thought process, and his efforts to\ndestroy evidence and to avoid capture by fleeing across the country amply demonstrate\nhis awareness of the wrongfulness of his actions.\n       In light of the evidence and relevant considerations, we conclude defendant‘s\nsentence is not disproportionate to his personal culpability, nor does it shock the\nconscience.\n\n       C. Challenges to California’s Death Penalty Scheme\n       Defendant raises a number of challenges to the constitutionality of California‘s\ndeath penalty scheme, based upon the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments\nof the United States Constitution. As he acknowledges, we have previously considered\nand consistently rejected these contentions in prior cases. Presented with no reasons that\ncompel reconsideration, we adhere to those decisions as follows.\n       Section 190.2 is not impermissibly overbroad. Specifically, the various special\ncircumstances are not so numerous as to fail to perform the constitutionally required\nnarrowing function, and the special circumstances are not unduly broad or expansive,\neither on their face or as interpreted by this court.

The death penalty is available only for the crime of first\ndegree murder, and only when a special circumstance is found true; furthermore,\nadministration of the penalty is governed by constitutional and statutory provisions\ndifferent from those applying to ‗regular punishment‘ for felonies.‖ (People v.\nDemetrulias (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633509\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633509/people-v-demetrulias/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43–44.)\n       Lastly, we find no state or federal constitutional violation when the asserted\ndefects in California‘s death penalty scheme are considered collectively.
