Introduction\n\n      The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (the Department) appeals the\n\ntrial court’s partial denial of its plea to the jurisdiction in the wrongful death\n\nlawsuit filed against it by Appellee Bonnie Ledbetter, Individually and as\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of John Ledbetter, and Freddie Ledbetter, Callie\n\nLedbetter, Amber Bogusch, Ashley Ledbetter, and John Ledbetter, Jr.\n\n(collectively, Ledbetter). The Department contends in one issue that the trial\n\ncourt erred by denying the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction because there is\n\nno evidence that the use of tangible personal property proximately caused John\n\nLedbetter’s death. We affirm.\n\n                             II. Procedural History\n\n      Ledbetter filed this suit in June 2010. She alleges in her fifth amended\n\npetition that her son John Ledbetter (John) died while in the Department’s\n\ncustody and that the Department is liable for his death because the Department’s\n\nemployees used or misused a transport van, handcuffs, and restraints. More\n\nspecifically, Ledbetter alleges that on June 27, 2008, John was not coherent and\n\nvomited in his cell. Department correctional officers transported John by van to\n\nanother prison facility for evaluation and did not call for an ambulance so that\n\nJohn could be taken to a hospital. Prior to laying John on the backseat of the\n\nvan, the officers placed him in handcuffs and belly and ankle cuffs with a chain\n\nrunning between his hands, belly chain, and ankles.       Ledbetter alleges that,\n\nbecause of the restraints, John ―could not move him self as needed to take care\n\n\n                                        4\n\fof himself when vomiting.‖ Ledbetter further alleges that ―[w]hen John arrived at\n\nthe Robertson Unit, the nurses immediately saw that John was not breathing and\n\nstarted CPR[,] but it was too late. The misuse of the restraints, which were\n\nplaced on John by employees, agents and servants of [the Department] . . . [was]\n\na direct and proximate cause of John’s death.‖ ―John died because he aspirated\n\nvomit.‖\n\n      The Department filed its plea to the jurisdiction in September 2011, and the\n\ntrial court conducted a hearing in February 2012. The appellate record does not\n\ncontain a written response by Ledbetter, but we note that there are several\n\nwitness statements attached to Ledbetter’s fifth amended petition. The trial court\n\ngranted the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction in part as to Ledbetter’s\n\nallegations concerning the use or misuse of the transport van but also denied the\n\nplea to the jurisdiction in part. As to the partial denial, the trial court’s order\n\nstates that ―[t]he case will proceed under the Texas Tort Claims Act solely\n\npredicated upon the alleged use or misuse of restraints.‖       This interlocutory\n\nappeal by the Department followed.2 See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann.\n\n§ 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp. 2012).\n\n                            III. Standard of Review\n\n      Whether the trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law\n\nthat we review de novo. Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT-Davy, 74\n\n      2\n      Ledbetter has not appealed the trial court’s partial grant of the\nDepartment’s plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                        5\n\fS.W.3d 849, 855 (Tex. 2002). A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea that\n\nchallenges the trial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nBlue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000). It is used to defeat a cause of action\n\nwithout regard to whether the claims asserted have merit. Id.\n\n      The plaintiff has the burden of alleging facts that affirmatively establish the\n\ntrial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction. Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd.,\n\n852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993). We construe the pleadings liberally in favor of\n\nthe plaintiff, look to the pleader’s intent, and accept the pleadings’ factual\n\nallegations as true. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217,\n\n226 (Tex. 2004). If, as in this case, a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the\n\nexistence of jurisdictional facts, we consider relevant evidence submitted by the\n\nparties that is necessary to resolve the jurisdictional issues. Id. at 227; Bland, 34\n\nS.W.3d at 555.\n\n      The plea to the jurisdiction standard generally mirrors that of a traditional\n\nmotion for summary judgment. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228; see Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n166a(c).   The governmental unit is required to meet the summary judgment\n\nstandard of proof for its assertion that the trial court lacks jurisdiction. Miranda,\n\n133 S.W.3d at 228. Once the governmental unit meets its burden, the plaintiff is\n\nthen required to show there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional\n\nissue. Id. We take as true all evidence favorable to the nonmovant, and we\n\nindulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the nonmovant’s\n\nfavor. Wise Reg’l Health Sys. v. Brittain, 268 S.W.3d 799, 805 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\n\n                                          6\n\fWorth 2008, no pet.) (citing Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228).             If the evidence\n\ncreates a fact question regarding jurisdiction, the trial court must deny the plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction and leave its resolution to the factfinder. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at\n\n227–28. But if the evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the\n\njurisdictional issue, the trial court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter\n\nof law. Id. at 228.\n\n                               IV. Sovereign Immunity\n\n      The Department asserts that it is entitled to sovereign immunity from suit.\n\nUnless waived by the State, sovereign immunity from suit defeats a trial court’s\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.    Id. at 225–26.     Relevant to this case, section\n\n101.021(2) of the Tort Claims Act waives immunity only for personal injury and\n\ndeath ―caused by a condition or use of tangible personal or real property if the\n\ngovernmental unit would, were it a private person, be liable to the claimant\n\naccording to Texas law.‖ Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.021(2) (West\n\n2011). Conversely, the Tort Claims Act does not waive sovereign immunity if the\n\nState would not be liable to the claimant under Texas law if it were a private\n\nperson. Id.; see City of Fort Worth v. Robinson, 300 S.W.3d 892, 897 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 2009, no pet.). Thus, the Tort Claims Act creates a unique\n\nstatutory scheme in which immunity from liability and immunity from suit are\n\ncoextensive. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 224; see also Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\nAnn. § 101.021(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      At issue in this case is causation. The Department argues that Ledbetter\n\nhas not pleaded and offered evidence that the use of tangible personal property\n\ncaused John’s death.      Ledbetter responds that John died as a result of the\n\nofficers’ use of restraints because ―the application of the restraints onto an\n\nunconscious and vomiting John led directly to his inability to clear his airways\n\nand ultimately his death.‖\n\n      ―Section 101.021(2) requires that for immunity to be waived, personal\n\ninjury or death must be proximately caused by the condition or use of tangible\n\nproperty.‖   Dallas Cnty. Mental Health & Mental Retardation v. Bossley, 968\n\nS.W.2d 339, 343 (Tex.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1017 (1998). To satisfy this\n\nrequirement, there must be ―a nexus between the use of tangible property and\n\nthe plaintiff’s injuries.‖ Tex. Tech Univ. Health Scis. Ctr. v. Ward, 280 S.W.3d\n\n345, 352 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2008, pet. denied) (citing Dallas Area Rapid\n\nTransit v. Whitley, 104 S.W.3d 540, 542–43 (Tex. 2003)). Ledbetter’s pleadings\n\nare clearly sufficient to allege that the use of the restraints caused John’s death.\n\nAmong other things, Ledbetter alleges that the ―misuse of the restraints . . . were\n\na direct and proximate cause of John’s death,‖ that the Department\n\n―[a]ffirmatively us[ed] . . . the restraining devices to restrain John Ledbetter while\n\nhe was vomiting without a way to allow him to protect himself and without\n\nprotecting him,‖ and that ―John died because he aspirated vomit.‖ We thus focus\n\non whether the Department’s evidence negated causation as a matter of law and,\n\nif so, whether Ledbetter presented evidence that the alleged misuse of the\n\n\n                                          8\n\frestraining devices caused John’s death. See id.; see also Bossley, 968 S.W.2d\n\nat 343; Brittain, 268 S.W.3d at 805.\n\n                     V. Plea to the Jurisdiction Evidence\n\n      The record before the trial court at the hearing on the Department’s plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction consisted of Ledbetter’s fifth amended petition, the witness\n\nstatements attached to Ledbetter’s fifth amended petition, the Department’s plea\n\nto the jurisdiction, and the autopsy report attached to the Department’s plea.\n\nBecause we assume the truth of the nonmovant’s evidence when reviewing a\n\nplea to the jurisdiction, Brittain, 268 S.W.3d at 805, we summarize the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to Ledbetter, the nonmovant.\n\n      Sergeant D. Pierce’s written statement provides that an officer escorted\n\nJohn into the medical department at approximately 10 p.m. on June 27, 2008,\n\nbecause John had been ―removing his clothes on several occasions and walking\n\naround the dayroom.‖ The nurse on duty said that nothing could be done for\n\nJohn until a psychological evaluation could be conducted the next morning, but\n\nJohn was moved to a segregated cell. In ordering John to pack his belongings to\n\nbe moved, Sergeant Pierce noted that John seemed confused. At approximately\n\n4 a.m. the next morning, Sergeant Pierce saw that John ―had thrown up on the\n\nfloor with a brown coffee type substance,‖ was lying on his bunk, and was\n\nnonresponsive. Sergeant Pierce wrote that John ―was just lying there shaking\n\nand moving his arms and head around.‖ Sergeant Pierce then called to have\n\nJohn transported to the Robertson Unit for evaluation, and officers placed John\n\n\n                                        9\n\fonto a gurney for the transport and temporarily took him to the medical\n\ndepartment.\n\n      Sergeant Pierce also wrote the following in his witness statement:\n\n      While in Medical, I had Officer Skeens remove [John’s] shirt due to\n      the liquids on it and he was placed in transport restraints. [John]\n      was awake and breathing at this time[;] he was shaking and moving\n      his head around. He was not talking or making any noises. . . .\n      When [the transport van] arrived, I along with Officer Skeens\n      assisted [John] into the side doors of the transport Van. I had\n      control of [John]’s upper body and Officer Skeens had control of\n      [John]’s legs and he was lifted from the gurney to the backseat of\n      the transport Van. At this time I was inside the Van and placed\n      [John] in a lying down position on his left side due to [his] not being\n      able to sit up on his own and throwing up at this time. [John] was\n      still moving his head and shaking at this time. The transport team\n      left for the Robertson Unit with all three Officers in the front cab area\n      due to space limitations with [John] laying down on the only seat in\n      the middle section and the need to transport [him] in an urgent\n      manner.\n\n      Officer J. Martinez wrote in his statement that he retrieved restraints after\n\nbeing notified that John would be transferred to Robertson Unit and that he and\n\nother officers ―applied the transport restraints.‖ According to Officer Martinez’s\n\nstatement, John was placed into the transport van ―on his side to prevent choking\n\ndue to his prior vomiting.‖ The transport van departed at 4:20 a.m., arrived at the\n\nRobertson Unit at 4:22 a.m., and pulled up to the Robertson Unit Medical\n\nDepartment at approximately 4:25 a.m. Officer Martinez wrote that John was\n\nmoaning and shaking upon arrival but that he was no longer moaning when the\n\nofficers opened the van doors.      During transport, John ―had rolled himself in\n\nbetween the seat where he was lying on his side.‖ Officer Martinez checked\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fJohn’s pulse and ―observed it to be very faint.‖ Officer Martinez also helped\n\nmove John to a gurney and watched as nurses began CPR.\n\n       Nurse R. Mayfield’s written statement provides that John was ―face down\n\nbetween [the] seat and cage‖ when she first saw him. Nurse Mayfield called the\n\nambulance, and officers removed John from the van and placed him on a gurney.\n\nNurse Mayfield wrote that John’s ―face and head was purple, pupils fixed and\n\ndilated.‖\n\n       Nurse G. Perales wrote in her statement that she heard officers say that\n\nJohn was not breathing and that she ―jumped [onto the] gurney and started chest\n\ncompression.‖ Nurse Perales also wrote:\n\n       Told my supervisor to get Ambubag from under gurney to give air.\n       Airway clear. [Nurse] Mayfield, LVN pushing gurney down hallway\n       toward ER Room. More Security arrived. Assisting with CPR.\n       Airway suctioned out. O2 applied with Ambubag at 10 L/M. Patient\n       not responding. Skin cold and purple. No pulse or respiration\n       noted. Ambulance had been called. CPR continued. Paramedics\n       arrived. MD called at HMC and given report told to stop CPR. CPR\n       in progress X 30 minutes approx. Heart monitors showing no\n       cardiac activity. Paramedics applied their heart monitors and\n       nothing was seen. Hear[t] not responding. CPR was ordered by\n       HMC Doctor to be discontinued. End of CPR rescue efforts.\n\n       Nurse C. Williamson’s statement reflects that John was ―lying face down\n\nbetween the seat and the cage‖ in the transport van when she first saw him. He\n\nwas transferred from the van to the gurney by the officers, and someone called\n\nEMS. Nurse Williamson also wrote: ―[John’s] color was purple on head and\n\nface, pupils were fixed, above nipple line color was lightly red/purple and\n\nmottled.‖ John had no pulse three minutes later, but nurses continued CPR until\n\n\n                                      11\n\fthe paramedics arrived. The paramedics assessed John’s condition after they\n\narrived and contacted Dr. Maloney who told them to stop CPR.3\n\n      The last written statement attached to Ledbetter’s petition is by inmate\n\nJesus Ezpinoza. Ezpinoza wrote that the officers were not trying to help John\n\ndespite his requests for help and that they only offered him a cup of water.\n\nEzpinoza further stated that the ―officers finally got him some medical attention\n\n[when] he was drooling out green stuff from his mouth.‖ Ezpinoza wrote that\n\nJohn was trembling when he initially walked into his cell but that his ―bones were\n\ntr[e]mbling‖ when the officers carried him out to the gurney.\n\n      The Department’s only evidence is the autopsy report. The listed findings\n\ninclude that John was ―pronounced dead in infirmary following episode of\n\ndisorientation, vomiting, and convulsions (by history)‖ and that John had severe\n\natherosclerotic coronary artery disease, severe pulmonary edema and\n\ncongestion, cardiomegaly, and arteriolonephrosclerosis. The medical examiner\n\nlisted the causes of death as ―congestive heart failure due to hypertensive and\n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease‖ and chronic hepatitis. The autopsy report\n\nalso stated that John’s airways were ―patent, containing no foreign objects or\n\nmaterial.‖\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      John was pronounced dead at 5:03 a.m.             His hand restraints were\nremoved at 7:02 a.m.\n\n\n                                        12\n\f                                   VI. Analysis\n\n      The Department contends that the trial court lacks subject matter\n\njurisdiction because Ledbetter failed to plead and prove that the use of restraints\n\ncaused John’s death and thereby failed to establish a waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity under the Tort Claims Act. Specifically, the Department argues that the\n\nautopsy report establishes that John died from heart failure and that Ledbetter\n\nhas presented no evidence tending to show that John died of asphyxiation as a\n\nresult of being restrained while vomiting.\n\n      We conclude that the evidence in the plea to the jurisdiction record does\n\nnot conclusively disprove causation.         Although the autopsy report does not\n\ninclude aspiration as an immediate or secondary cause of John’s death, we are\n\nrequired to review the evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, indulging\n\nevery reasonable inference and resolving any doubts in her favor. See Brittain,\n\n268 S.W.3d at 805. Considered in that light, evidence other than the autopsy\n\nreport shows that John may have asphyxiated and that the restraints could have\n\nbeen a proximate cause of John’s death. John was vomiting when placed into\n\nthe transport van and was restrained while in the van. Sergeant Pierce wrote in\n\nhis statement that John was placed ―in a lying down position‖ in the transport van\n\nbecause he could not sit up on his own and was ―throwing up at this time.‖\n\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, a reasonable\n\ninference may be drawn that John was vomiting after he was placed in the van.\n\nAlthough Officer Martinez’s statement provides that John was placed on his side\n\n\n                                         13\n\fto prevent choking, there is no evidence that John did not continue vomiting en\n\nroute to the Robertson Unit as no one rode in the back of the van with John to\n\nobserve his condition during the transport. In addition, all three nurses noted\n\nthat, upon arrival at the Robertson Unit, John’s coloring was purple.      Nurse\n\nPerales wrote in her statement that she was called by Nurse Mayfield to help\n\nwhile the officers were removing John from the van. She heard them say, ―He is\n\nnot breathing.‖ She then ―jumped up gurney and started chest compression‖ and\n\ntold her supervisor to give John air. She then wrote that John’s airway was clear,\n\nall of this occurring as Nurse Perales was continuing CPR and as Nurse Mayfield\n\nwas pushing the gurney toward the emergency room. John’s airway was then\n\nsuctioned.\n\n      Applying the appropriate standard of review, Nurse Perales’s statements\n\nthat John’s airway was clear and was suctioned out do not conclusively negate\n\nthe possibility that John’s airway was obstructed when Nurse Perales began\n\nCPR upon John’s arrival at the Robertson Unit. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at\n\n228; Brittain, 268 S.W.3d at 805. The Department relies on the statement in the\n\nautopsy report that John’s airway was open, clear, and ―contain[ed] no foreign\n\nobjects or material,‖ but the suctioning of John’s airway would explain the\n\nmedical examiner’s failure to find obstructions in John’s airway when he\n\nperformed the autopsy later that day.       Thus, in the absence of affirmative\n\nevidence offered by the Department that John’s physical symptoms upon arrival\n\nat the Robertson Unit were not consistent with asphyxiation, the evidence does\n\n\n                                       14\n\fnot conclusively disprove Ledbetter’s theory that John asphyxiated on vomit as a\n\nresult of being restrained in the transport van.\n\n         Applying the appropriate standard of review and thus reviewing the plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, we hold that the\n\nevidence does not conclusively show that the Department’s use of restraints was\n\nnot a proximate cause of John’s death. See generally Brittain, 268 S.W.3d at\n\n808 (―The causation requirement in section 101.021(2) is one of proximate\n\ncause-not a heightened standard such as sole cause.‖). Although the evidence\n\narguably preponderates against a conclusion that the restraints proximately\n\ncaused John’s death in that he was apparently suffering from a cardiac event\n\nprior to being restrained and was determined to have died as a result of\n\ncongestive heart failure, the evidence does not conclusively negate the use of\n\nrestraints as a proximate cause of John’s death and is likewise conflicting as to\n\nwhether the Department’s use of restraints was, although not the sole cause, a\n\nproximate cause of John’s death. The trial court therefore did not err by denying\n\nthe Department’s plea to the jurisdiction. We overrule the Department’s sole\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                                  VII.

Introduction\n\n      The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (the Department) appeals the\n\ntrial court’s partial denial of its plea to the jurisdiction in the wrongful death\n\nlawsuit filed against it by Appellee Bonnie Ledbetter, Individually and as\n\nRepresentative of the Estate of John Ledbetter, and Freddie Ledbetter, Callie\n\nLedbetter, Amber Bogusch, Ashley Ledbetter, and John Ledbetter, Jr.\n\n(collectively, Ledbetter). The Department contends in one issue that the trial\n\ncourt erred by denying the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction because there is\n\nno evidence that the use of tangible personal property proximately caused John\n\nLedbetter’s death. We affirm.\n\n                             II. Procedural History\n\n      Ledbetter filed this suit in June 2010. She alleges in her fifth amended\n\npetition that her son John Ledbetter (John) died while in the Department’s\n\ncustody and that the Department is liable for his death because the Department’s\n\nemployees used or misused a transport van, handcuffs, and restraints. More\n\nspecifically, Ledbetter alleges that on June 27, 2008, John was not coherent and\n\nvomited in his cell. Department correctional officers transported John by van to\n\nanother prison facility for evaluation and did not call for an ambulance so that\n\nJohn could be taken to a hospital. Prior to laying John on the backseat of the\n\nvan, the officers placed him in handcuffs and belly and ankle cuffs with a chain\n\nrunning between his hands, belly chain, and ankles.       Ledbetter alleges that,\n\nbecause of the restraints, John ―could not move him self as needed to take care\n\n\n                                        4\n\fof himself when vomiting.‖ Ledbetter further alleges that ―[w]hen John arrived at\n\nthe Robertson Unit, the nurses immediately saw that John was not breathing and\n\nstarted CPR[,] but it was too late. The misuse of the restraints, which were\n\nplaced on John by employees, agents and servants of [the Department] . . . [was]\n\na direct and proximate cause of John’s death.‖ ―John died because he aspirated\n\nvomit.‖\n\n      The Department filed its plea to the jurisdiction in September 2011, and the\n\ntrial court conducted a hearing in February 2012. The appellate record does not\n\ncontain a written response by Ledbetter, but we note that there are several\n\nwitness statements attached to Ledbetter’s fifth amended petition. The trial court\n\ngranted the Department’s plea to the jurisdiction in part as to Ledbetter’s\n\nallegations concerning the use or misuse of the transport van but also denied the\n\nplea to the jurisdiction in part. As to the partial denial, the trial court’s order\n\nstates that ―[t]he case will proceed under the Texas Tort Claims Act solely\n\npredicated upon the alleged use or misuse of restraints.‖       This interlocutory\n\nappeal by the Department followed.2 See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann.\n\n§ 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp. 2012).\n\n                            III. Standard of Review\n\n      Whether the trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law\n\nthat we review de novo. Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT-Davy, 74\n\n      2\n      Ledbetter has not appealed the trial court’s partial grant of the\nDepartment’s plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 855 (Tex. 2002). A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea that\n\nchallenges the trial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nBlue, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1449865\"><a href=\"/opinion/1449865/bland-independent-school-dist-v-blue/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554 (Tex. 2000). It is used to defeat a cause of action\n\nwithout regard to whether the claims asserted have merit. Id.\n\n      The plaintiff has the burden of alleging facts that affirmatively establish the\n\ntrial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction. Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1515115\"><a href=\"/opinion/1515115/tex-assn-of-business-v-air-control-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 446 (Tex. 1993). We construe the pleadings liberally in favor of\n\nthe plaintiff, look to the pleader’s intent, and accept the pleadings’ factual\n\nallegations as true. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894512\"><a href=\"/opinion/894512/texas-dept-parks-and-wildlife-v-miranda/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n226 (Tex. 2004). If, as in this case, a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the\n\nexistence of jurisdictional facts, we consider relevant evidence submitted by the\n\nparties that is necessary to resolve the jurisdictional issues. Id. at 227; Bland, 34\n\nS.W.3d at 555.\n\n      The plea to the jurisdiction standard generally mirrors that of a traditional\n\nmotion for summary judgment. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228; see Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n166a(c).   The governmental unit is required to meet the summary judgment\n\nstandard of proof for its assertion that the trial court lacks jurisdiction. Miranda,\n\n133 S.W.3d at 228. Once the governmental unit meets its burden, the plaintiff is\n\nthen required to show there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional\n\nissue. Id. We take as true all evidence favorable to the nonmovant, and we\n\nindulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the nonmovant’s\n\nfavor. Wise Reg’l Health Sys. v. Brittain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1488091\"><a href=\"/opinion/1488091/wise-regional-health-systems-v-brittain/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 805 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\n\n                                          6\n\fWorth 2008, no pet.) (citing Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228).             If the evidence\n\ncreates a fact question regarding jurisdiction, the trial court must deny the plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction and leave its resolution to the factfinder. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at\n\n227–28. But if the evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the\n\njurisdictional issue, the trial court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter\n\nof law. Id. at 228.\n\n                               IV. Sovereign Immunity\n\n      The Department asserts that it is entitled to sovereign immunity from suit.\n\nUnless waived by the State, sovereign immunity from suit defeats a trial court’s\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction.    Id. at 225–26.     Relevant to this case, section\n\n101.021(2) of the Tort Claims Act waives immunity only for personal injury and\n\ndeath ―caused by a condition or use of tangible personal or real property if the\n\ngovernmental unit would, were it a private person, be liable to the claimant\n\naccording to Texas law.‖ Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 101.021(2) (West\n\n2011). Conversely, the Tort Claims Act does not waive sovereign immunity if the\n\nState would not be liable to the claimant under Texas law if it were a private\n\nperson. Id.; see City of Fort Worth v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761327\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761327/city-of-fort-worth-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 897 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 2009, no pet.). Thus, the Tort Claims Act creates a unique\n\nstatutory scheme in which immunity from liability and immunity from suit are\n\ncoextensive. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 224; see also Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\nAnn. § 101.021(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      At issue in this case is causation. The Department argues that Ledbetter\n\nhas not pleaded and offered evidence that the use of tangible personal property\n\ncaused John’s death.      Ledbetter responds that John died as a result of the\n\nofficers’ use of restraints because ―the application of the restraints onto an\n\nunconscious and vomiting John led directly to his inability to clear his airways\n\nand ultimately his death.‖\n\n      ―Section 101.021(2) requires that for immunity to be waived, personal\n\ninjury or death must be proximately caused by the condition or use of tangible\n\nproperty.‖   Dallas Cnty. Mental Health & Mental Retardation v. Bossley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1652488\"><a href=\"/opinion/1652488/dallas-cty-mental-health-and-mental-retardation-v-bossley/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 (Tex.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998). To satisfy this\n\nrequirement, there must be ―a nexus between the use of tangible property and\n\nthe plaintiff’s injuries.‖ Tex. Tech Univ. Health Scis. Ctr. v. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">345</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2008, pet. denied) (citing Dallas Area Rapid\n\nTransit v. Whitley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1616022\"><a href=\"/opinion/1616022/dallas-area-rapid-transit-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 542–43 (Tex. 2003)). Ledbetter’s pleadings\n\nare clearly sufficient to allege that the use of the restraints caused John’s death.\n\nAmong other things, Ledbetter alleges that the ―misuse of the restraints . . . were\n\na direct and proximate cause of John’s death,‖ that the Department\n\n―[a]ffirmatively us[ed] . . . the restraining devices to restrain John Ledbetter while\n\nhe was vomiting without a way to allow him to protect himself and without\n\nprotecting him,‖ and that ―John died because he aspirated vomit.‖ We thus focus\n\non whether the Department’s evidence negated causation as a matter of law and,\n\nif so, whether Ledbetter presented evidence that the alleged misuse of the\n\n\n                                          8\n\frestraining devices caused John’s death. See id.; see also Bossley, 968 S.W.2d\n\nat 343; Brittain, 268 S.W.3d at 805.\n\n                     V. Plea to the Jurisdiction Evidence\n\n      The record before the trial court at the hearing on the Department’s plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction consisted of Ledbetter’s fifth amended petition, the witness\n\nstatements attached to Ledbetter’s fifth amended petition, the Department’s plea\n\nto the jurisdiction, and the autopsy report attached to the Department’s plea.\n\nBecause we assume the truth of the nonmovant’s evidence when reviewing a\n\nplea to the jurisdiction, Brittain, 268 S.W.3d at 805, we summarize the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to Ledbetter, the nonmovant.\n\n      Sergeant D. Pierce’s written statement provides that an officer escorted\n\nJohn into the medical department at approximately 10 p.m. on June 27, 2008,\n\nbecause John had been ―removing his clothes on several occasions and walking\n\naround the dayroom.‖ The nurse on duty said that nothing could be done for\n\nJohn until a psychological evaluation could be conducted the next morning, but\n\nJohn was moved to a segregated cell. In ordering John to pack his belongings to\n\nbe moved, Sergeant Pierce noted that John seemed confused. At approximately\n\n4 a.m. the next morning, Sergeant Pierce saw that John ―had thrown up on the\n\nfloor with a brown coffee type substance,‖ was lying on his bunk, and was\n\nnonresponsive. Sergeant Pierce wrote that John ―was just lying there shaking\n\nand moving his arms and head around.‖ Sergeant Pierce then called to have\n\nJohn transported to the Robertson Unit for evaluation, and officers placed John\n\n\n                                        9\n\fonto a gurney for the transport and temporarily took him to the medical\n\ndepartment.\n\n      Sergeant Pierce also wrote the following in his witness statement:\n\n      While in Medical, I had Officer Skeens remove [John’s] shirt due to\n      the liquids on it and he was placed in transport restraints. [John]\n      was awake and breathing at this time[;] he was shaking and moving\n      his head around. He was not talking or making any noises. . . .\n      When [the transport van] arrived, I along with Officer Skeens\n      assisted [John] into the side doors of the transport Van. I had\n      control of [John]’s upper body and Officer Skeens had control of\n      [John]’s legs and he was lifted from the gurney to the backseat of\n      the transport Van. At this time I was inside the Van and placed\n      [John] in a lying down position on his left side due to [his] not being\n      able to sit up on his own and throwing up at this time. [John] was\n      still moving his head and shaking at this time. The transport team\n      left for the Robertson Unit with all three Officers in the front cab area\n      due to space limitations with [John] laying down on the only seat in\n      the middle section and the need to transport [him] in an urgent\n      manner.\n\n      Officer J. Martinez wrote in his statement that he retrieved restraints after\n\nbeing notified that John would be transferred to Robertson Unit and that he and\n\nother officers ―applied the transport restraints.‖ According to Officer Martinez’s\n\nstatement, John was placed into the transport van ―on his side to prevent choking\n\ndue to his prior vomiting.‖ The transport van departed at 4:20 a.m., arrived at the\n\nRobertson Unit at 4:22 a.m., and pulled up to the Robertson Unit Medical\n\nDepartment at approximately 4:25 a.m. Officer Martinez wrote that John was\n\nmoaning and shaking upon arrival but that he was no longer moaning when the\n\nofficers opened the van doors.      During transport, John ―had rolled himself in\n\nbetween the seat where he was lying on his side.‖ Officer Martinez checked\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fJohn’s pulse and ―observed it to be very faint.‖ Officer Martinez also helped\n\nmove John to a gurney and watched as nurses began CPR.\n\n       Nurse R. Mayfield’s written statement provides that John was ―face down\n\nbetween [the] seat and cage‖ when she first saw him. Nurse Mayfield called the\n\nambulance, and officers removed John from the van and placed him on a gurney.\n\nNurse Mayfield wrote that John’s ―face and head was purple, pupils fixed and\n\ndilated.‖\n\n       Nurse G. Perales wrote in her statement that she heard officers say that\n\nJohn was not breathing and that she ―jumped [onto the] gurney and started chest\n\ncompression.‖ Nurse Perales also wrote:\n\n       Told my supervisor to get Ambubag from under gurney to give air.\n       Airway clear. [Nurse] Mayfield, LVN pushing gurney down hallway\n       toward ER Room. More Security arrived. Assisting with CPR.\n       Airway suctioned out. O2 applied with Ambubag at 10 L/M. Patient\n       not responding. Skin cold and purple. No pulse or respiration\n       noted. Ambulance had been called. CPR continued. Paramedics\n       arrived. MD called at HMC and given report told to stop CPR. CPR\n       in progress X 30 minutes approx. Heart monitors showing no\n       cardiac activity. Paramedics applied their heart monitors and\n       nothing was seen. Hear[t] not responding. CPR was ordered by\n       HMC Doctor to be discontinued. End of CPR rescue efforts.\n\n       Nurse C. Williamson’s statement reflects that John was ―lying face down\n\nbetween the seat and the cage‖ in the transport van when she first saw him. He\n\nwas transferred from the van to the gurney by the officers, and someone called\n\nEMS. Nurse Williamson also wrote: ―[John’s] color was purple on head and\n\nface, pupils were fixed, above nipple line color was lightly red/purple and\n\nmottled.‖ John had no pulse three minutes later, but nurses continued CPR until\n\n\n                                      11\n\fthe paramedics arrived. The paramedics assessed John’s condition after they\n\narrived and contacted Dr. Maloney who told them to stop CPR.3\n\n      The last written statement attached to Ledbetter’s petition is by inmate\n\nJesus Ezpinoza. Ezpinoza wrote that the officers were not trying to help John\n\ndespite his requests for help and that they only offered him a cup of water.\n\nEzpinoza further stated that the ―officers finally got him some medical attention\n\n[when] he was drooling out green stuff from his mouth.‖ Ezpinoza wrote that\n\nJohn was trembling when he initially walked into his cell but that his ―bones were\n\ntr[e]mbling‖ when the officers carried him out to the gurney.\n\n      The Department’s only evidence is the autopsy report. The listed findings\n\ninclude that John was ―pronounced dead in infirmary following episode of\n\ndisorientation, vomiting, and convulsions (by history)‖ and that John had severe\n\natherosclerotic coronary artery disease, severe pulmonary edema and\n\ncongestion, cardiomegaly, and arteriolonephrosclerosis. The medical examiner\n\nlisted the causes of death as ―congestive heart failure due to hypertensive and\n\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease‖ and chronic hepatitis. The autopsy report\n\nalso stated that John’s airways were ―patent, containing no foreign objects or\n\nmaterial.‖\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      John was pronounced dead at 5:03 a.m.             His hand restraints were\nremoved at 7:02 a.m.\n\n\n                                        12\n\f                                   VI. Analysis\n\n      The Department contends that the trial court lacks subject matter\n\njurisdiction because Ledbetter failed to plead and prove that the use of restraints\n\ncaused John’s death and thereby failed to establish a waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity under the Tort Claims Act. Specifically, the Department argues that the\n\nautopsy report establishes that John died from heart failure and that Ledbetter\n\nhas presented no evidence tending to show that John died of asphyxiation as a\n\nresult of being restrained while vomiting.\n\n      We conclude that the evidence in the plea to the jurisdiction record does\n\nnot conclusively disprove causation.         Although the autopsy report does not\n\ninclude aspiration as an immediate or secondary cause of John’s death, we are\n\nrequired to review the evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, indulging\n\nevery reasonable inference and resolving any doubts in her favor. See Brittain,\n\n268 S.W.3d at 805. Considered in that light, evidence other than the autopsy\n\nreport shows that John may have asphyxiated and that the restraints could have\n\nbeen a proximate cause of John’s death. John was vomiting when placed into\n\nthe transport van and was restrained while in the van. Sergeant Pierce wrote in\n\nhis statement that John was placed ―in a lying down position‖ in the transport van\n\nbecause he could not sit up on his own and was ―throwing up at this time.‖\n\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, a reasonable\n\ninference may be drawn that John was vomiting after he was placed in the van.\n\nAlthough Officer Martinez’s statement provides that John was placed on his side\n\n\n                                         13\n\fto prevent choking, there is no evidence that John did not continue vomiting en\n\nroute to the Robertson Unit as no one rode in the back of the van with John to\n\nobserve his condition during the transport. In addition, all three nurses noted\n\nthat, upon arrival at the Robertson Unit, John’s coloring was purple.      Nurse\n\nPerales wrote in her statement that she was called by Nurse Mayfield to help\n\nwhile the officers were removing John from the van. She heard them say, ―He is\n\nnot breathing.‖ She then ―jumped up gurney and started chest compression‖ and\n\ntold her supervisor to give John air. She then wrote that John’s airway was clear,\n\nall of this occurring as Nurse Perales was continuing CPR and as Nurse Mayfield\n\nwas pushing the gurney toward the emergency room. John’s airway was then\n\nsuctioned.\n\n      Applying the appropriate standard of review, Nurse Perales’s statements\n\nthat John’s airway was clear and was suctioned out do not conclusively negate\n\nthe possibility that John’s airway was obstructed when Nurse Perales began\n\nCPR upon John’s arrival at the Robertson Unit. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at\n\n228; Brittain, 268 S.W.3d at 805. The Department relies on the statement in the\n\nautopsy report that John’s airway was open, clear, and ―contain[ed] no foreign\n\nobjects or material,‖ but the suctioning of John’s airway would explain the\n\nmedical examiner’s failure to find obstructions in John’s airway when he\n\nperformed the autopsy later that day.       Thus, in the absence of affirmative\n\nevidence offered by the Department that John’s physical symptoms upon arrival\n\nat the Robertson Unit were not consistent with asphyxiation, the evidence does\n\n\n                                       14\n\fnot conclusively disprove Ledbetter’s theory that John asphyxiated on vomit as a\n\nresult of being restrained in the transport van.\n\n         Applying the appropriate standard of review and thus reviewing the plea to\n\nthe jurisdiction evidence in the light most favorable to Ledbetter, we hold that the\n\nevidence does not conclusively show that the Department’s use of restraints was\n\nnot a proximate cause of John’s death. See generally Brittain, 268 S.W.3d at\n\n808 (―The causation requirement in section 101.021(2) is one of proximate\n\ncause-not a heightened standard such as sole cause.‖). Although the evidence\n\narguably preponderates against a conclusion that the restraints proximately\n\ncaused John’s death in that he was apparently suffering from a cardiac event\n\nprior to being restrained and was determined to have died as a result of\n\ncongestive heart failure, the evidence does not conclusively negate the use of\n\nrestraints as a proximate cause of John’s death and is likewise conflicting as to\n\nwhether the Department’s use of restraints was, although not the sole cause, a\n\nproximate cause of John’s death. The trial court therefore did not err by denying\n\nthe Department’s plea to the jurisdiction. We overrule the Department’s sole\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                                  VII. Conclusion\n\n         Having overruled the Department’s sole issue, we affirm the trial court’s\n\norder.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    ANNE GARDNER\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: GARDNER, MCCOY, and MEIER, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: December 21, 2012\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f</pre>",
