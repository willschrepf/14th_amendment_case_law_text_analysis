The latest Court Order, from which the United States appeals, is reported, Boyd v. Pointe Coupee Parish School Board, 332 F.Supp. 994 (D.C.La.1971).  The District Court denied an application for supplemental relief, on the ground that the school system had become unitary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As of the entry of the Order, eight of the ten schools in the system did not meet Singleton ratio requirements (419 F.2d 1211 en banc (5 Cir., 1970)).  In one attendance area there was an all black school and another that was virtually all white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, therefore, must hold that the Pointe Coupee school system had not attained unitary status and that the Order of the District Court in this respect must be reversed, Ellis v. Board of Public Instruction of Orange County, Florida, 5 Cir., 1970, 423 F.2d 203; Mays v. Board of Public Instruction of Sarasota County, Florida, 4 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 809; Lemon v. Bossier Parish School, 5 Cir., 1971, 444 F.2d 1400; Beaumont Independent School v.

There was a mass exodus of white students to private schools.  Public school attendance during the ensuing years has been as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <pre> Year    White  Black\n ----    -----  -----\n1968-69  2375   3643\n1969-70   680   No\n                statistics\n1970-71  1232   3857\n1971-72  1234   3688\n1972-73  1535   3715\n1973-74  1573   3606\n1974-75  1605   3546</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, from the attendance low of 680 in 1969-70, white enrollment in five years has increased by approximately 250%, although it yet remains 770 below what it was when the desegregation process was begun.  In any event, progress is obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statistics supplied for 1974-75 reveal the presence of three all black schools: LaBarre Elementary, 104 to 0; Rosenwald High, 1253 to 0; and St. Alma Elementary, 137 to 0.  The other six schools are well integrated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Upper Pointe Coupee School, Grades K to 12, current statistics indicate that thirty classes are all black and thirteen are totally white, or almost so.
