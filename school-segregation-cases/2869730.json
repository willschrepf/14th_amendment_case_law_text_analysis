The sanctions imposed on Torres did not\nrevoke any good-time credits or otherwise affect the fact or\nlength of his confinement; he was placed in disciplinary\ndetention for 15 days and administrative custody for 120\ndays. Yet the District Court ruled that his due process\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. For habeas purposes, \"custody\" includes not only incarceration, but\nalso other restraints on liberty, such as parole. See, e.g., Jones v.\nCunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 242-43 (1963).\n\n                                2\n\n\nclaim was not cognizable under S 1983 because of the\n\"favorable termination rule\" announced in Heck v.\nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), and extended to prison\ndisciplinary sanctions that alter the duration of a prisoner’s\nincarceration in Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641 (1997).\nUnder that rule, a S 1983 plaintiff cannot seek damages for\nharm caused by actions the unlawfulness of which would\nnecessarily render the fact or length of his confinement\ninvalid, unless he can prove that the conviction, sentence,\nor prison disciplinary sanction that resulted from those\nactions has been reversed, invalidated, or called into\nquestion by a grant of federal habeas corpus relief (in other\nwords, terminated favorably to the plaintiff). Heck, 512 U.S.\nat 486-87; Edwards, 520 U.S. at 646-48.\n\nTorres’s appeal presents a question that neither the\nSupreme Court nor our Court has decided: whether\nsomeone no longer in custody (and thus unable to petition\nfor a writ of habeas corpus) can seek damages under\nS 1983 for an allegedly unconstitutional prison disciplinary\nsanction that did not affect the fact or length of his\nconfinement. We hold that the favorable termination rule\ndoes not apply to claims that implicate only the conditions,\nand not the fact or duration, of a prisoner’s incarceration.\nWe thus hold that the District Court erred in ruling that\nTorres’s due process claim is not cognizable underS 1983.\n\nNonetheless, we affirm the District Court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on a different ground. The sanctions\nimposed on Torres were within the scope of his sentence\nand, under Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995), and our\n\frecent decision in Fraise v. Terhune, 283 F.3d 506 (3d Cir.\n2002), did not impinge a liberty interest protected by the\nConstitution’s Due Process Clause.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural History\n\nOn July 14, 1993, Torres, a former inmate at New\nJersey’s Bayside State Prison (\"BSP\"), appeared before the\nBSP Classification Committee (the \"Committee\") while still\nin prison. The Committee informed Torres that it had\ngranted him \"Full Minimum Status,\" which in this instance\nmeant placement in a minimum security prison for a work\n\n                                3\n\n\ndetail. That minimum security prison, known as the Farm\nUnit, is located outside the walls surrounding the main\nprison at BSP.\n\nAfter leaving the Committee, Torres, a paranoid\nschizophrenic, entered a delusional state and became\nconvinced that placement in the Farm Unit would harm\nhim. He asked defendant Percy Garner, the prison guard\nescorting him from the Committee hearing, if he could\nreturn to the Committee and ask for reconsideration of his\nreassignment. After his request was denied, Torres\ninformed Garner that if he was reassigned to the Farm Unit\nhe would try to escape. Garner authored a disciplinary\nreport based on Torres’s statement, charging him with\nviolating New Jersey Administrative Code S 10A:4-\n4.1(a)*.102 (attempting to plan an escape). As a result,\nTorres was placed in pre-hearing detention. He\nsubsequently requested and received a consultation with\ndefendant Lisa Little, the staff psychologist, who\ndetermined that he was mentally fit for the general prison\npopulation.\n\nOn July 19, 1993, defendant Lance Meehan, a hearing\nofficer, conducted a disciplinary hearing with regard to the\nescape charge against Torres. Meehan found Torres guilty\nof attempting to plan an escape, sentenced him to 15 days\nof disciplinary detention and 120 days of administrative\nsegregation, and referred him for a psychological\nevaluation. Meehan did not revoke any of Torres’s good-\ntime credits.\n\nTorres appealed Meehan’s decision to defendants E.\nCalvin Neubert and Conrad Dilks, the Prison\nAdministrators, who affirmed it. Torres did not appeal to\nthe New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, as\npermitted under New Jersey Court Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). 2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Because of the strong state interest in internal prison administration,\nsee, e.g., Pernsley v. Harris, 474 U.S. 965, 966-67 (1985) (Burger,\nRehnquist, and O’Connor, JJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari);\nHarris v. Pernsley, 758 F.2d 83 (3d Cir. 1985) (Adams, Hunter, Weis,\nGarth & Becker, JJ., dissenting from denial of petition for rehearing en\nbanc), and because Torres failed to complete state appellate review\n\fprocedures before bringing his S 1983 action, Judge Roth would abstain\n\n                                4\n\n\nOn December 12, 1993, Torres was released from\ncustody. A year and a half later, he filed a pro se S 1983\naction in the United States District Court for the District of\nNew Jersey, alleging that the defendants acted unlawfully\nin connection with the disciplinary decision.3 He\nsubsequently retained counsel and filed an amended\ncomplaint on June 24, 1996. In that complaint, Torres\nalleged that William Fauver (the Commissioner of the New\nJersey Department of Corrections), Meehan, Neubert, and\nDilks violated his right to due process because he was\nfound guilty of the disciplinary charge and sanctioned even\nthough the charge was not supported by substantial\nevidence. He also alleged Eighth Amendment violations that\nare not pertinent here.\n\nOn January 16, 1998, the defendants moved for\nsummary judgment. On September 29, 1998, the District\nCourt granted summary judgment in favor of Fauver,\nMeehan, Neubert, and Dilks on Torres’s due process claim,\nand denied Torres’s cross-motion for summary judgment\nagainst Meehan. The Court relied on Edwards v. Balisok,\n520 U.S. 641 (1997), to find that Torres’s claim was not\ncognizable because its success necessarily would imply the\ninvalidity of the disciplinary decision to place him in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nfrom providing a federal forum for Torres’s due process claim. See\nYounger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971); O’Neill v. City of Philadelphia, 32\nF.3d 785 (3d Cir. 1994). She does not, however, disagree with the panel’s\nanalysis of the merits.\n\nJudges Ambro and Fuentes believe that the comity concerns\nunderlying Younger abstention do not apply because the State willingly\nsubmitted to federal-court jurisdiction at every stage of this litigation,\nand never asked any federal court to abstain from adjudicating Torres’s\nclaims. See Morales v. Trans World Airlines, 504 U.S. 374, 381 n.1\n(1992); Swisher v. Brady, 438 U.S. 204, 213 n.11 (1978); Winston v.\nChildren and Youth Services of Delaware County, 948 F.2d 1380, 1384-\n85 (3d Cir. 1991); McLaughlin v. Pernsley, 876 F.2d 308, 314 n.5 (1989).\n\n3. Because Torres filed the current lawsuit before Congress enacted the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat.\n1321 (1996), the PLRA’s requirement that prisoners must exhaust\navailable administrative remedies before challenging prison conditions\nunder S 1983, see 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a), did not bar his suit.\n\n                                5\n\n\ndetention and administrative segregation. In addition, the\nCourt dismissed Torres’s Eighth Amendment claims against\nall of the defendants except Neubert and Dilks. After\nfurther discovery, on June 29, 1999, the Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Neubert and Dilks on the\nremaining claims. Torres filed a timely notice of appeal, and\n\fwe subsequently appointed pro bono counsel for him.4\n\nTorres’s sole claim on appeal is that the District Court\nerred in concluding that the favorable termination rule bars\na former prisoner from using S 1983 to challenge a prison\ndisciplinary sanction that did not affect the length of his\nconfinement. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.S 1291.\n\nII. Standard of Review\n\nWe must review the record to determine whether the\nDistrict Court properly concluded that there was no\ngenuine issue of material fact and that the defendants were\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Bushman v. Halm,\n798 F.2d 651, 656 (3d Cir. 1986). We exercise plenary\nreview over the District Court’s choice and interpretation of\nlegal precepts as well as its application of those precepts to\nthe historical facts. Orvosh v. Program of Group Ins. for\nSalaried Employees of Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 222 F.3d\n123, 129 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nIII. Section 1983 and Prison Disciplinary Sanctions\n\nWhether Torres’s due process claim is cognizable under\nS 1983 raises two separate questions: whether the favorable\ntermination rule applies to prison disciplinary sanctions\nthat do not affect the fact or length of a prisoner’s\nconfinement, and, more generally, whether the rule applies\nto persons who cannot seek habeas relief. Only if both\nquestions are answered affirmatively does the favorable\ntermination rule bar Torres’s claim; if the answer to either\nquestion is no, his claim is cognizable.\n\nWith respect to the first question, the Supreme Court has\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. We acknowledge with appreciation the able and zealous pro bono\nrepresentation of Torres by Philip N. Yannella, Esquire.\n\n                                6\n\n\nconsistently distinguished between claims that necessarily\nimplicate the fact or duration of confinement (which it has\nrepeatedly held are subject to the favorable termination\nrule) and claims that relate only to the conditions of\nincarceration (which it has not suggested are subject to the\nfavorable termination rule). Edwards v. Balisok , 520 U.S.\n641, 646-48 (1997); Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486-\n87 (1994); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 499 (1973).\nThis line of cases instructs, and all but one of the circuit\ncourts to consider the issue have held, that both current\nand former prisoners can use S 1983 to raise claims\nrelating only to the conditions, and not the fact or duration,\nof their confinement without satisfying the favorable\ntermination rule. Because Torres raises such a claim (and\nthus the answer to the first question above is no), we need\nnot consider the second, broader question of whether the\nfavorable termination rule applies to persons unable to\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus.5\n\f_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. In Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1 (1998), five Justices announced in\ndicta that they would hold that the favorable termination rule applies\nonly to prisoners who can assert their claims in a habeas proceeding.\nThe issue in Spencer was whether a prisoner’s habeas petition, which\nsought to invalidate an order revoking his parole, still presented an\nArticle III case or controversy after his reincarceration ended. Eight\nJustices held that it did not. 523 U.S. at 7, 14-18. In an attempt to\ndemonstrate an injury-in-fact, the prisoner argued that his habeas\npetition could not be moot because, if it were, Heck’s favorable\ntermination rule would bar him from bringing a S 1983 action, and he\nwould be left without any federal forum in which he could seek redress\nfor the parole revocation. Id. at 17. The opinion of the Court dismissed\nthe prisoner’s contention as \"a great non sequitur, unless one believes\n(as we do not) that a S 1983 action for damages must always and\neverywhere be available.\" Id.\n\nHowever, five Justices--four in a concurrence, one in a dissent--\nexpressly rejected the majority’s \"great non sequitur\" dictum and said\nthat the favorable termination rule applies \"only[to] inmates seeking\nS 1983 damages for unconstitutional conviction or confinement.\" Id. at\n20-21 (Souter, J., concurring, joined by O’Connor, Ginsburg & Breyer,\nJJ.) (emphases added); id. at 25 n.8 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (agreeing\nwith Justice Souter’s position). Current and former prisoners who cannot\nseek habeas relief, they said, can bring a S 1983 claim without satisfying\nthe favorable termination rule even if they are challenging the legality of\ntheir conviction or the fact or duration of their confinement. Id. at 21.\n\n                                7\n\n\nA.\n\nIn Preiser, the first case to address the overlap between\nS 1983 and the federal habeas laws, state prisoners\ndeprived of good-time credits as a result of disciplinary\nproceedings sought restoration of the credits, which would\nhave resulted in their immediate release, underS 1983. 411\nU.S. at 476-77. The Supreme Court held that in light of the\nspecific federal remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. S 2254, the\nprisoners’ request for injunctive relief was not cognizable\nunder the broad language of S 1983. Id. at 489-90, 500.\nThe Court explained that \"state prisoners attacking the\nvalidity of the fact or length of their confinement\" must\nproceed in federal court under the habeas laws, which\nexpressly require exhaustion of adequate state remedies,\nand may not use S 1983 to circumvent this requirement.6\nId. at 489-90. However, the Court emphasized that \"a\nS 1983 action is a proper remedy for a state prisoner who\nis making a constitutional challenge to the conditions of his\nprison life, but not to the fact or length of his custody.\" Id.\nat 499.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSince Spencer, the Second and Seventh Circuits have adopted this\nposition. DeWalt v. Carter, 224 F.3d 607, 617-18 (7th Cir. 2000) (relying\non Spencer to overrule Anderson v. County of Montgomery, 111 F.3d 494,\n499 (7th Cir. 1997), which held that Heck barred a former prisoner from\nchallenging his conviction in a S 1983 suit even if he could not seek\n\fhabeas relief); Leather v. Eyck, 180 F.3d 420, 424 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding\nthat Heck did not bar a plaintiff who was convicted and fined--but not\nimprisoned--from alleging selective prosecution under S 1983 because he\nwas never in custody and thus could not seek habeas relief). But see\nRandell v. Johnson, 227 F.3d 300, 300-01 (5th Cir. 2000) (per curiam)\n(holding that Heck barred a former prisoner from alleging under S 1983\nthat he was improperly made to serve two sentences for the same offense\nbecause he was not given credit for his initial prison stay); Figueroa v.\nRivera, 147 F.3d 77, 80-81 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding that Heck barred the\nheirs of a prisoner who died in custody from challenging his conviction\nand imprisonment under S 1983).\n\nAs noted, this case does not require us to consider the broader\nquestion of whether a S 1983 remedy must be available where habeas\nrelief is not.\n\n6. Section 1983 plaintiffs need not exhaust state remedies. Patsy v. Bd.\nof Regents of Fla., 457 U.S. 496, 501 (1982).\n\n                                8\n\n\nDamages are not available in habeas proceedings, so\nPreiser left open whether a prisoner can use aS 1983\ndamages action to challenge the constitutionality of his\nconviction. The Supreme Court addressed this issue in\nHeck, where a state prisoner sought damages--but not\nspeedier release--under S 1983, alleging that his conviction\nwas obtained through unlawful investigatory practices and\nthe destruction of exculpatory evidence. 512 U.S. at 479. It\nheld that the prisoner had no cause of action underS 1983\nbecause the success of his suit would effectively invalidate\nhis underlying conviction and sentence. Id. at 486-87, 490.\nThe Court reasoned that the prisoner’s action was\nanalogous to the common-law tort of malicious prosecution,\nan essential element of which is that the prosecution\nterminated in the accused’s favor. Id. at 484. This\nrequirement eliminates the potential for conflicting\nresolutions arising from parallel civil and criminal\nproceedings, and prevents a prisoner from mounting a\ncollateral attack on his conviction. Id. (citations omitted).\n\nThe Heck Court concluded that the principle that civil\ntort actions cannot be used to undermine \"outstanding\ncriminal judgments applies to S 1983 damages actions that\nnecessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of\nhis conviction or confinement, just as it has always applied\nto actions for malicious prosecution.\" Id. at 486. Heck thus\nadopted the favorable termination rule: if the success of a\nS 1983 damages suit \"would necessarily imply the invalidity\nof his conviction or sentence,\" the plaintiff ’s claim is\ncognizable only if he can prove that his conviction or\nsentence was reversed, invalidated, or called into question\nby a grant of federal habeas corpus relief. Id. at 486-87\n(emphasis added).7 On the other hand, \"if the district court\ndetermines that the plaintiff ’s action, even if successful,\nwill not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding\ncriminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f7. Stated from a statute-of-limitations perspective, \"a S 1983 cause of\naction for damages attributable to an unconstitutional conviction or\nsentence does not accrue until the conviction or sentence has been\ninvalidated.\" Id. at 489-90.\n\n                                9\n\n\nbe allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to\nthe suit.\" Id. at 487 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original).8\n\nIn Edwards, the Supreme Court applied Heck’s favorable\ntermination rule to prison disciplinary sanctions that affect\nthe duration of a prisoner’s incarceration. The case involved\na state prisoner who lost 30 days of good-time credits and\nwas placed in restrictive settings (isolation for 10 days,\nsegregation for 20) after a hearing officer found him guilty\nof violating prison rules. 520 U.S. at 643. Alleging that the\nofficer was biased against him and dishonestly suppressed\nexculpatory evidence, the prisoner sought declaratory relief\nand damages9 under S 1983. Id. at 643, 647. In contrast to\nHeck, where the prisoner directly attacked the\nconstitutionality of his conviction, the prisoner in Edwards\ndid not seek restoration of his good-time credits, and thus\ndid not request relief that would alter the term of his\nconfinement. Id. at 643-44. Nevertheless, the Court held\nthat his claims were not cognizable under S 1983 because\n\"[t]he principal procedural defect\" he alleged (the bias of the\nhearing oficer) \"would, if established, necessarily imply the\ninvalidity of the deprivation of his good-time credits.\" Id. at\n646-48. Importantly, nothing in Edwards indicates that the\nfavorable termination rule would have applied if the\nprisoner’s sanction had not affected the duration of his\nconfinement. Indeed, the Court carefully framed the\nquestion presented as \"whether a claim for damages and\ndeclaratory relief brought by a state prisoner challenging\nthe validity of the procedures used to deprive him of good-\ntime credits is cognizable under S 1983.\" Id. at 643.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Foreshadowing his Spencer opinion, see supra note 5, Justice Souter,\njoined by three other Justices, concurred in the judgment to caution that\nthe Court’s broadly worded decision should not be read to impose a\nfavorable termination requirement on persons who cannot seek habeas\nrelief, lest those persons be rendered unable to redress a violation of\ntheir federal constitutional rights in any federal forum. Id. at 500-03.\n\n9. The prisoner also requested an injunction designed to bar prison\nofficials from suppressing evidence in the future, but the Supreme Court\ndid not consider this issue because it was neither raised before it nor\nconsidered by the lower courts. Id. at 648-49.\n\n                                10\n\n\nB.\n\nOther circuit courts’ decisions and a recent ruling by our\nCourt show that the favorable termination rule does not\napply to prison disciplinary sanctions that affect only the\n\fconditions, and not the fact or duration, of a prisoner’s\nconfinement. In Brown v. Plaut, 131 F.3d 163 (D.C. Cir.\n1997), the D.C. Circuit held that a prisoner could seek\ndamages under S 1983 for allegedly being placed in\nadministrative segregation without due process. 10 Id. at\n167-68. The Court explained that \"[t]he [Supreme] Court\nhas never deviated from Preiser’s clear line between\nchallenges to the fact or length of custody and challenges to\nthe conditions of confinement.\" Id. at 168. It noted that\nEdwards \"repeatedly characteriz[ed] the plaintiff ’s claim as\none that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the\ndeprivation of his good-time credits\" and that Heck\n\"observed that the damages action in that case was in effect\nan attack on the fact or length of confinement.\" Id. (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted); see also\nAnyanwutaku v. Moore, 151 F.3d 1053, 1055-56 (D.C. Cir.\n1998) (holding that a prisoner’s claim that prison officials\nmiscalculated his parole eligibility date was cognizable\nunder S 1983 because \"D.C. parole decisions are entirely\ndiscretionary\" and the success of the claim thus would not\nnecessarily accelerate the prisoner’s release). 11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. The plaintiff was a former prisoner, Brown, 131 F.3d at 165, but that\ndid not factor into the D.C. Circuit’s analysis.\n\n11. The D.C. Circuit also noted that the Supreme Court’s 1995 opinion\nin Sandin (which we discuss below) did not question a prisoner’s use of\nS 1983 to challenge disciplinary proceedings that affected only the\nconditions of his confinement. Brown, 131 F.3d at 168. However, the\ndisciplinary sanction in Sandin was expunged, albeit before the prisoner\nbrought his S 1983 action. 515 U.S. at 476. In addition, the D.C. Circuit\nreasoned that Heck was distinguishable because the former prisoner was\nchallenging a decision that \"bears little resemblance to a judicial\nproceeding.\" Brown, 131 F.3d at 168. Because decisions to place inmates\nin administrative segregation are subject to greatly relaxed procedural\nrequirements, they \"would almost certainly be accorded no collateral\nestoppel effect,\" and thus \"hardly need[ ] to be insulated from collateral\nattack.\" Id. However, the same could be said of the disciplinary sanction\nin Edwards, which the D.C. Circuit did not distinguish on this point.\n\n                                11\n\n\nSimilarly, in Jenkins v. Haubert, 179 F.3d 19 (2d Cir.\n1999), the Second Circuit held that a prisoner could seek\ndamages and injunctive relief under S 1983 for being\nsentenced to \"keeplock,\" a particularly strict form of\nadministrative segregation, allegedly in violation of due\nprocess.12 Id. at 20-21. The Court agreed with the D.C.\nCircuit that Heck and Edwards do not bar a prisoner from\nusing S 1983 to challenge a prison disciplinary sanction\nthat did not affect the fact or length of his confinement. Id.\nat 27. The Second Circuit explained that Preiser \"assumed\"\nthat prisoners could challenge being placed in disciplinary\nsegregation under S 1983, and that neither Heck nor\nEdwards suggested that the favorable termination rule\napplies when the fact or duration of a prisoner’s\nincarceration is not implicated.13 Id.\n\fThe Seventh Circuit joined the Second and D.C. Circuits\nin DeWalt v. Carter, 224 F.3d 607 (7th Cir. 2000), holding\nthat a state prisoner could seek damages under S 1983 for\nbeing subjected to a disciplinary sanction that cost him his\nprison job, allegedly based on his race and in retaliation for\nactivities protected by the First Amendment. Id. at 611,\n613. The Court explained that, unlike Preiser , Heck, and\nEdwards, the prisoner’s claims did not relate to the fact or\nduration of his confinement.14Id. at 616-17; accord Sheldon\nv. Hundley, 83 F.3d 231, 234 (8th Cir. 1996) (stating in\ndicta that \"prisoners who challenge disciplinary rulings that\ndo not lengthen their sentence are probably outside the\nhabeas statute and able to seek damages under S 1983\nwithout showing favorable termination\").\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. As in Brown, the Jenkins plaintiff was a former prisoner, 179 F.3d at\n20, but the Second Circuit held that the same analysis applies\nregardless whether a S 1983 plaintiff remains in custody. Id. at 21.\n\n13. While the Second Circuit also relied on the dicta in Spencer, it noted\nthat its holding was fully supported by the D.C. Circuit’s reasoning in\nBrown. Jenkins, 179 F.2d at 27.\n\n14. DeWalt, relying in part on the dicta in Spencer, overruled Stone-Bey\nv. Barnes, 120 F.3d 718, 721 (7th Cir. 1997), which held that, under\nHeck and Edwards, the favorable termination rule applies to prison\ndisciplinary sanctions even though they do not affect the fact or length\nof a prisoner’s confinement. DeWalt, 224 F.3d at 617-18.\n\n                                12\n\n\nMost recently, we held in Leamer v. Fauver, No. 98-6007,\n2002 WL 624068 (3d Cir. Apr. 19, 2002), that a sex\noffender incarcerated indefinitely at a specialized treatment\ncenter could bring a S 1983 suit alleging that state officials\nviolated his constitutional rights by placing him on\nrestrictive status and depriving him of therapy. 15 Id. at *7-9.\nWe explained that the favorable termination rule applies\nonly if a prisoner’s claim necessarily implicates the fact or\nduration of his confinement. Id. at *7. Although the\ndisciplinary sanction prevented the offender from obtaining\ntreatment that might expedite his release, it did not\nnecessarily affect the length of his incarceration, and thus\nHeck and Edwards did not apply. Id. at *7-8.16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. Our research reveals that only one circuit court continues to insist\nthat the favorable termination rule applies to claims that implicate only\nthe conditions of a prisoner’s confinement. In Huey v. Stine, 230 F.3d\n226 (6th Cir. 2000), the Sixth Circuit held that Heck and Edwards\nbarred a prisoner from alleging under S 1983 that his Eighth Amendment\nrights were violated when he was put in detention and stripped of\nprivileges for thirty days. Id. at 228, 230. Relying on its prior\nunpublished opinions, the Court failed to consider whether it mattered\nthat the disciplinary measures at issue did not affect the duration of the\nprisoner’s incarceration. Id. at 228-29. The Sixth Circuit did not explain\nwhy it disagreed with every other court of appeals to address this issue.\nWe believe that Huey’s extension of Heck and Edwards to claims that\n\frelate only to prison conditions is unwarranted. The Supreme Court has\nnever questioned Preiser’s statement, see 411 U.S. at 499, that prisoners\ncan challenge the conditions of their confinement under S 1983, and the\nprimary concern underlying Heck and Edwards (the possibility that\nprisoners will use S 1983 to attack collaterally the fact or duration of\ntheir confinement) does not apply when the underlying disciplinary\nsanction relates only to the conditions of a prisoner’s incarceration.\n\n16. Cf. Neal v. Shimoda, 131 F.3d 818, 824 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that\nprisoners could use S 1983 to challenge being compelled to participate in\na sex offender treatment program as a prerequisite for parole eligibility);\nGeorgevich v. Strauss, 772 F.2d 1078, 1087 (3d Cir. 1985) (en banc)\n(holding that prisoners can contest parole procedures under S 1983\nwhere the success of their claims would not necessarily affect \"the actual\nduration of [their] confinement\").\n\n                                13\n\n\nC.\n\nIn this context, we hold that Torres’s due process claim\nis cognizable under S 1983. Preiser concluded that a\nprisoner may use S 1983 to attack \"the conditions of his\nprison life,\" 411 U.S. at 499, and both Heck and Edwards\nadhered to \"Preiser’s clear line between challenges to the\nfact or length of custody and challenges to the conditions of\nconfinement.\" Brown, 131 F.3d at 168. The favorable\ntermination rule does not apply when a prisoner’sS 1983\nclaims can implicate only the conditions, and not the fact\nor duration, of his confinement. This is regardless whether\nhe remains in custody, as in Leamer, 2002 WL 624068, at\n*7, and DeWalt, 224 F.3d at 616-17, or is no longer in\ncustody, as in Jenkins, 179 F.3d at 27, and Brown, 131\nF.3d at 168. Torres’s claim challenges the procedures by\nwhich he was sentenced to disciplinary detention and\nadministrative segregation. Because these punishments did\nnot alter the length of his incarceration, the success of his\nclaim would not \"necessarily imply the invalidity of \" the\nfact or duration of his confinement. Edwards, 520 U.S. at\n646; Heck, 512 U.S. at 486-87. Thus the District Court\nerred in concluding that the favorable termination rule\nbarred Torres from proceeding under S 1983.\n\nIV. No Violation of Protected Liberty Interest\n\nAlthough Torres’s due process claim is cognizable under\nS 1983, to survive summary judgment he had to present\nevidence that he suffered a violation of a liberty interest\nprotected by the Constitution’s Due Process Clause.\nBecause he did not, we affirm.\n\nA protected liberty interest in avoiding prison disciplinary\nsanctions can arise either from the Due Process Clause\nitself or from state law. Asquith v. Dep’t of Corrections, 186\nF.3d 407, 409 (3d Cir. 1999) (citation omitted). No liberty\ninterest traced from the Due Process Clause is implicated if\n\"the conditions or degree of confinement to which a\nprisoner is subjected [are] within the sentence imposed\nupon him\" and do not otherwise violate the Constitution.\n\fFraise v. Terhune, 283 F.3d 506, 522 (3d Cir. 2002)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In other\n\n                                14\n\n\nwords, where there is no state-created liberty interest, the\nDue Process Clause applies only if the restraints at issue\nexceed the prisoner’s sentence \"in such an unexpected\nmanner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process\nClause of [their] own force\" and do not violate any other\nconstitutional provision. Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472,\n484 (1995). Because disciplinary detention and\n\"administrative segregation [are] the sort[s] of confinement\nthat inmates should reasonably anticipate receiving at\nsome point in their incarceration,\" Torres’s transfer to \"less\namenable and more restrictive quarters\" did not implicate a\nliberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. Hewitt\nv. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 468 (1983); Fraise , 283 F.3d at\n522.\n\nNor was Torres deprived of any state-created liberty\ninterest. In Sandin, the Supreme Court sharply curtailed\nthe situations in which the negative implications of\nmandatory language in state laws or regulations can create\na protected liberty interest in the prison context. The case\ninvolved a prisoner’s claim that Hawaii prison officials\ndeprived him of due process when they charged him with\nmisconduct and, following a hearing, placed him in\ndisciplinary segregation in the \"Special Holding Unit\" for 30\ndays. Id. at 475-76. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\nconcluded that because a prison regulation in Hawaii\nrequired that substantial evidence must support a\nmisconduct charge, the prisoner was deprived of a\nprotected liberty interest if he was put in segregation\npursuant to a decision lacking such evidentiary support. Id.\nat 476-77. The Supreme Court reversed, explaining that the\nfocus must be on the nature of the deprivation, not merely\non the language of state laws and regulations. Id. at 481-\n84. The Court explained that mandatory language in a state\nlaw or regulation can create a protected liberty interest only\nif the alleged deprivation \"imposes atypical and significant\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents\nof prison life.\" Id. at 484. The Court determined that\nbecause the plaintiff ’s confinement \"mirrored those\nconditions imposed upon inmates in administrative\nsegregation and protective custody,\" and because inmates\nin the general population at the plaintiff ’s prison\nexperienced \"significant amounts of ‘lockdown time,’ \" the\n\n                                15\n\n\nprisoner was not deprived of a protected liberty interest. Id.\nat 486.\n\nSandin instructs that whether the restraint at issue\n\"imposes atypical and significant hardship\" depends on the\nparticular state in which the plaintiff is incarcerated. Id. We\nrecently held in Fraise that New Jersey prisoners were not\n\fdeprived of a protected liberty interest when they were\nplaced in the \"Security Threat Group Management Unit\"\n(\"STGMU\"), an especially harsh form of administrative\ndetention \"designed to isolate and rehabilitate gang\nmembers.\"17 283 F.3d at 509, 522-23. Prisoners placed in\nthe STGMU were consigned to \"maximum custody\" until\nthey completed a \"three-phase behavior modification and\neducation program,\" in which they learned, inter alia, non-\nviolent methods of conflict resolution. Id. at 511. If a\nprisoner refused to renounce his affiliation with all\n\"security threat groups,\" he would remain in the STGMU\nindefinitely. Id. at 511. Among other restrictions, inmates\ntransferred to the STGMU were allowed just five hours per\nweek outside their cells, were strip-searched every time\nthey exited or reentered their cells, could shower or shave\nonly every third day, were banned from regular prison\nprograms, and were prohibited from corresponding with\nany other inmate. Id. at 523 n.1 (Rendell, J., dissenting).\nWe held that these \"additional restrictions\" did \"not impose\nan atypical and significant hardship in relation to the\nordinary incidents of prison life,\" and thus did not implicate\na protected liberty interest. Id. at 522-23 (citations omitted).18\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. Judge Rendell dissented on a different issue, but agreed with the\nmajority’s analysis of the due process issue. Id. at 530 n.13 (Rendell, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n18. Cf. Leamer, 2002 WL 624068, at *9-10 (holding that sex offender had\na protected liberty interest in obtaining treatment that was \"mandated\nand promised\" by New Jersey’s \"unique statutory scheme\" for\nincarcerating sex offenders, was \"an inherent and integral element of the\nscheme,\" and was \"inextricably linked\" to the duration of his\nconfinement); Shoats v. Horn, 213 F.3d 140, 144 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding\nthat a Pennsylvania prisoner who was kept in administrative custody for\neight years and denied contact with any humans aside from corrections\nofficers during that period--a form of \"permanent solitary confinement\"\nthat the State conceded was virtually \"unique\" within its prison system--\nwas deprived of a protected liberty interest).\n\n                                16\n\n\nUnder Sandin and Fraise, we cannot say that Torres has\nalleged \"the type of atypical, significant deprivation in\nwhich a State might conceivably create a liberty interest.\"\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 486. \"Sandin instructs that placement\nin administrative confinement will generally not create a\nliberty interest.\" Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 224 (3d\nCir. 2000) (citation omitted). Torres was placed in\ndisciplinary detention for 15 days and administrative\nsegregation for 120 days in a State where prisoners have no\nprotected liberty interest in being free of indefinite\nconfinement in the STGMU. See Fraise, 283 F.3d at 522-\n23; cf. Griffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706-08 (3d Cir.\n1997) (holding that a Pennsylvania prisoner did not have a\nprotected liberty interest in avoiding being placed in\nadministrative custody for 15 months because such lengthy\nstays were not atypical in Pennsylvania’s penal system).\nTherefore, Torres was not deprived of a protected liberty\n\finterest, and we affirm the District Court’s grant of\nsummary judgment for that reason.\n\nConclusion\n\nBecause Torres’s due process claim implicated only the\nconditions, and not the fact or duration, of his confinement,\nthe District Court erred in ruling that the claim was not\ncognizable under S 1983. However, summary judgment was\nappropriate because Torres was not deprived of a protected\nliberty interest. We therefore affirm.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                17\n\f",

The sanctions imposed on Torres did not\nrevoke any good-time credits or otherwise affect the fact or\nlength of his confinement; he was placed in disciplinary\ndetention for 15 days and administrative custody for 120\ndays. Yet the District Court ruled that his due process\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1.

Heck, 512 U.S.\nat 486-87; Edwards, 520 U.S. at 646-48.\n\nTorres’s appeal presents a question that neither the\nSupreme Court nor our Court has decided: whether\nsomeone no longer in custody (and thus unable to petition\nfor a writ of habeas corpus) can seek damages under\nS 1983 for an allegedly unconstitutional prison disciplinary\nsanction that did not affect the fact or length of his\nconfinement. We hold that the favorable termination rule\ndoes not apply to claims that implicate only the conditions,\nand not the fact or duration, of a prisoner’s incarceration.\nWe thus hold that the District Court erred in ruling that\nTorres’s due process claim is not cognizable underS 1983.\n\nNonetheless, we affirm the District Court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on a different ground.

Factual and Procedural History\n\nOn July 14, 1993, Torres, a former inmate at New\nJersey’s Bayside State Prison (\"BSP\"), appeared before the\nBSP Classification Committee (the \"Committee\") while still\nin prison. The Committee informed Torres that it had\ngranted him \"Full Minimum Status,\" which in this instance\nmeant placement in a minimum security prison for a work\n\n                                3\n\n\ndetail. That minimum security prison, known as the Farm\nUnit, is located outside the walls surrounding the main\nprison at BSP.\n\nAfter leaving the Committee, Torres, a paranoid\nschizophrenic, entered a delusional state and became\nconvinced that placement in the Farm Unit would harm\nhim. He asked defendant Percy Garner, the prison guard\nescorting him from the Committee hearing, if he could\nreturn to the Committee and ask for reconsideration of his\nreassignment. After his request was denied, Torres\ninformed Garner that if he was reassigned to the Farm Unit\nhe would try to escape. Garner authored a disciplinary\nreport based on Torres’s statement, charging him with\nviolating New Jersey Administrative Code S 10A:4-\n4.1(a)*.102 (attempting to plan an escape). As a result,\nTorres was placed in pre-hearing detention. He\nsubsequently requested and received a consultation with\ndefendant Lisa Little, the staff psychologist, who\ndetermined that he was mentally fit for the general prison\npopulation.\n\nOn July 19, 1993, defendant Lance Meehan, a hearing\nofficer, conducted a disciplinary hearing with regard to the\nescape charge against Torres.

Because Torres filed the current lawsuit before Congress enacted the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat.\n1321 (1996), the PLRA’s requirement that prisoners must exhaust\navailable administrative remedies before challenging prison conditions\nunder S 1983, see 42 U.S.C. S 1997e(a), did not bar his suit.\n\n                                5\n\n\ndetention and administrative segregation. In addition, the\nCourt dismissed Torres’s Eighth Amendment claims against\nall of the defendants except Neubert and Dilks. After\nfurther discovery, on June 29, 1999, the Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Neubert and Dilks on the\nremaining claims. Torres filed a timely notice of appeal, and\n\fwe subsequently appointed pro bono counsel for him.4\n\nTorres’s sole claim on appeal is that the District Court\nerred in concluding that the favorable termination rule bars\na former prisoner from using S 1983 to challenge a prison\ndisciplinary sanction that did not affect the length of his\nconfinement. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.S 1291.\n\nII.

Section 1983 and Prison Disciplinary Sanctions\n\nWhether Torres’s due process claim is cognizable under\nS 1983 raises two separate questions: whether the favorable\ntermination rule applies to prison disciplinary sanctions\nthat do not affect the fact or length of a prisoner’s\nconfinement, and, more generally, whether the rule applies\nto persons who cannot seek habeas relief. Only if both\nquestions are answered affirmatively does the favorable\ntermination rule bar Torres’s claim; if the answer to either\nquestion is no, his claim is cognizable.\n\nWith respect to the first question, the Supreme Court has\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. We acknowledge with appreciation the able and zealous pro bono\nrepresentation of Torres by Philip N. Yannella, Esquire.\n\n                                6\n\n\nconsistently distinguished between claims that necessarily\nimplicate the fact or duration of confinement (which it has\nrepeatedly held are subject to the favorable termination\nrule) and claims that relate only to the conditions of\nincarceration (which it has not suggested are subject to the\nfavorable termination rule).

Because Torres raises such a claim (and\nthus the answer to the first question above is no), we need\nnot consider the second, broader question of whether the\nfavorable termination rule applies to persons unable to\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus.5\n\f_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. In Spencer v. Kemna, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), five Justices announced in\ndicta that they would hold that the favorable termination rule applies\nonly to prisoners who can assert their claims in a habeas proceeding.\nThe issue in Spencer was whether a prisoner’s habeas petition, which\nsought to invalidate an order revoking his parole, still presented an\nArticle III case or controversy after his reincarceration ended. Eight\nJustices held that it did not. 523 U.S. at 7, 14-18. In an attempt to\ndemonstrate an injury-in-fact, the prisoner argued that his habeas\npetition could not be moot because, if it were, Heck’s favorable\ntermination rule would bar him from bringing a S 1983 action, and he\nwould be left without any federal forum in which he could seek redress\nfor the parole revocation. Id. at 17. The opinion of the Court dismissed\nthe prisoner’s contention as \"a great non sequitur, unless one believes\n(as we do not) that a S 1983 action for damages must always and\neverywhere be available.\" Id.\n\nHowever, five Justices--four in a concurrence, one in a dissent--\nexpressly rejected the majority’s \"great non sequitur\" dictum and said\nthat the favorable termination rule applies \"only[to] inmates seeking\nS 1983 damages for unconstitutional conviction or confinement.\" Id. at\n20-21 (Souter, J., concurring, joined by O’Connor, Ginsburg & Breyer,\nJJ.) (emphases added); id. at 25 n.8 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (agreeing\nwith Justice Souter’s position). Current and former prisoners who cannot\nseek habeas relief, they said, can bring a S 1983 claim without satisfying\nthe favorable termination rule even if they are challenging the legality of\ntheir conviction or the fact or duration of their confinement. Id. at 21.\n\n                                7\n\n\nA.\n\nIn Preiser, the first case to address the overlap between\nS 1983 and the federal habeas laws, state prisoners\ndeprived of good-time credits as a result of disciplinary\nproceedings sought restoration of the credits, which would\nhave resulted in their immediate release, underS 1983. 411\nU.S. at 476-77. The Supreme Court held that in light of the\nspecific federal remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. S 2254, the\nprisoners’ request for injunctive relief was not cognizable\nunder the broad language of S 1983. Id. at 489-90, 500.\nThe Court explained that \"state prisoners attacking the\nvalidity of the fact or length of their confinement\" must\nproceed in federal court under the habeas laws, which\nexpressly require exhaustion of adequate state remedies,\nand may not use S 1983 to circumvent this requirement.6\nId. at 489-90. However, the Court emphasized that \"a\nS 1983 action is a proper remedy for a state prisoner who\nis making a constitutional challenge to the conditions of his\nprison life, but not to the fact or length of his custody.\" Id.\nat 499.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSince Spencer, the Second and Seventh Circuits have adopted this\nposition.

Section 1983 plaintiffs need not exhaust state remedies. Patsy v. Bd.\nof Regents of Fla., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110753\"><a href=\"/opinion/110753/patsy-v-board-of-regents-of-fla/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501 (1982).\n\n                                8\n\n\nDamages are not available in habeas proceedings, so\nPreiser left open whether a prisoner can use aS 1983\ndamages action to challenge the constitutionality of his\nconviction. The Supreme Court addressed this issue in\nHeck, where a state prisoner sought damages--but not\nspeedier release--under S 1983, alleging that his conviction\nwas obtained through unlawful investigatory practices and\nthe destruction of exculpatory evidence. 512 U.S. at 479. It\nheld that the prisoner had no cause of action underS 1983\nbecause the success of his suit would effectively invalidate\nhis underlying conviction and sentence. Id. at 486-87, 490.\nThe Court reasoned that the prisoner’s action was\nanalogous to the common-law tort of malicious prosecution,\nan essential element of which is that the prosecution\nterminated in the accused’s favor. Id. at 484. This\nrequirement eliminates the potential for conflicting\nresolutions arising from parallel civil and criminal\nproceedings, and prevents a prisoner from mounting a\ncollateral attack on his conviction. Id. (citations omitted).\n\nThe Heck Court concluded that the principle that civil\ntort actions cannot be used to undermine \"outstanding\ncriminal judgments applies to S 1983 damages actions that\nnecessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of\nhis conviction or confinement, just as it has always applied\nto actions for malicious prosecution.\" Id. at 486. Heck thus\nadopted the favorable termination rule: if the success of a\nS 1983 damages suit \"would necessarily imply the invalidity\nof his conviction or sentence,\" the plaintiff ’s claim is\ncognizable only if he can prove that his conviction or\nsentence was reversed, invalidated, or called into question\nby a grant of federal habeas corpus relief. Id. at 486-87\n(emphasis added).7 On the other hand, \"if the district court\ndetermines that the plaintiff ’s action, even if successful,\nwill not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding\ncriminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should\n_________________________________________________________________\n\f7. Stated from a statute-of-limitations perspective, \"a S 1983 cause of\naction for damages attributable to an unconstitutional conviction or\nsentence does not accrue until the conviction or sentence has been\ninvalidated.\" Id. at 489-90.\n\n                                9\n\n\nbe allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to\nthe suit.\" Id. at 487 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original).8\n\nIn Edwards, the Supreme Court applied Heck’s favorable\ntermination rule to prison disciplinary sanctions that affect\nthe duration of a prisoner’s incarceration. The case involved\na state prisoner who lost 30 days of good-time credits and\nwas placed in restrictive settings (isolation for 10 days,\nsegregation for 20) after a hearing officer found him guilty\nof violating prison rules. 520 U.S. at 643. Alleging that the\nofficer was biased against him and dishonestly suppressed\nexculpatory evidence, the prisoner sought declaratory relief\nand damages9 under S 1983. Id. at 643, 647. In contrast to\nHeck, where the prisoner directly attacked the\nconstitutionality of his conviction, the prisoner in Edwards\ndid not seek restoration of his good-time credits, and thus\ndid not request relief that would alter the term of his\nconfinement. Id. at 643-44. Nevertheless, the Court held\nthat his claims were not cognizable under S 1983 because\n\"[t]he principal procedural defect\" he alleged (the bias of the\nhearing oficer) \"would, if established, necessarily imply the\ninvalidity of the deprivation of his good-time credits.\" Id. at\n646-48. Importantly, nothing in Edwards indicates that the\nfavorable termination rule would have applied if the\nprisoner’s sanction had not affected the duration of his\nconfinement. Indeed, the Court carefully framed the\nquestion presented as \"whether a claim for damages and\ndeclaratory relief brought by a state prisoner challenging\nthe validity of the procedures used to deprive him of good-\ntime credits is cognizable under S 1983.\" Id. at 643.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Foreshadowing his Spencer opinion, see supra note 5, Justice Souter,\njoined by three other Justices, concurred in the judgment to caution that\nthe Court’s broadly worded decision should not be read to impose a\nfavorable termination requirement on persons who cannot seek habeas\nrelief, lest those persons be rendered unable to redress a violation of\ntheir federal constitutional rights in any federal forum. Id. at 500-03.\n\n9. The prisoner also requested an injunction designed to bar prison\nofficials from suppressing evidence in the future, but the Supreme Court\ndid not consider this issue because it was neither raised before it nor\nconsidered by the lower courts. Id. at 648-49.\n\n                                10\n\n\nB.\n\nOther circuit courts’ decisions and a recent ruling by our\nCourt show that the favorable termination rule does not\napply to prison disciplinary sanctions that affect only the\n\fconditions, and not the fact or duration, of a prisoner’s\nconfinement. In Brown v. Plaut, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184384\"><a href=\"/opinion/184384/brown-ernest-v-plaut-william-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir.\n1997), the D.C. Circuit held that a prisoner could seek\ndamages under S 1983 for allegedly being placed in\nadministrative segregation without due process. 10 Id. at\n167-68. The Court explained that \"[t]he [Supreme] Court\nhas never deviated from Preiser’s clear line between\nchallenges to the fact or length of custody and challenges to\nthe conditions of confinement.\" Id. at 168. It noted that\nEdwards \"repeatedly characteriz[ed] the plaintiff ’s claim as\none that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the\ndeprivation of his good-time credits\" and that Heck\n\"observed that the damages action in that case was in effect\nan attack on the fact or length of confinement.\" Id.

Cir.\n1998) (holding that a prisoner’s claim that prison officials\nmiscalculated his parole eligibility date was cognizable\nunder S 1983 because \"D.C. parole decisions are entirely\ndiscretionary\" and the success of the claim thus would not\nnecessarily accelerate the prisoner’s release). 11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. The plaintiff was a former prisoner, Brown, 131 F.3d at 165, but that\ndid not factor into the D.C. Circuit’s analysis.\n\n11. The D.C. Circuit also noted that the Supreme Court’s 1995 opinion\nin Sandin (which we discuss below) did not question a prisoner’s use of\nS 1983 to challenge disciplinary proceedings that affected only the\nconditions of his confinement. Brown, 131 F.3d at 168. However, the\ndisciplinary sanction in Sandin was expunged, albeit before the prisoner\nbrought his S 1983 action. 515 U.S. at 476. In addition, the D.C. Circuit\nreasoned that Heck was distinguishable because the former prisoner was\nchallenging a decision that \"bears little resemblance to a judicial\nproceeding.\" Brown, 131 F.3d at 168. Because decisions to place inmates\nin administrative segregation are subject to greatly relaxed procedural\nrequirements, they \"would almost certainly be accorded no collateral\nestoppel effect,\" and thus \"hardly need[ ] to be insulated from collateral\nattack.\" Id. However, the same could be said of the disciplinary sanction\nin Edwards, which the D.C. Circuit did not distinguish on this point.\n\n                                11\n\n\nSimilarly, in Jenkins v. Haubert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764670\"><a href=\"/opinion/764670/eric-jenkins-v-lt-haubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir.\n1999), the Second Circuit held that a prisoner could seek\ndamages and injunctive relief under S 1983 for being\nsentenced to \"keeplock,\" a particularly strict form of\nadministrative segregation, allegedly in violation of due\nprocess.12 Id. at 20-21. The Court agreed with the D.C.\nCircuit that Heck and Edwards do not bar a prisoner from\nusing S 1983 to challenge a prison disciplinary sanction\nthat did not affect the fact or length of his confinement. Id.\nat 27. The Second Circuit explained that Preiser \"assumed\"\nthat prisoners could challenge being placed in disciplinary\nsegregation under S 1983, and that neither Heck nor\nEdwards suggested that the favorable termination rule\napplies when the fact or duration of a prisoner’s\nincarceration is not implicated.13 Id.\n\fThe Seventh Circuit joined the Second and D.C.

Apr. 19, 2002), that a sex\noffender incarcerated indefinitely at a specialized treatment\ncenter could bring a S 1983 suit alleging that state officials\nviolated his constitutional rights by placing him on\nrestrictive status and depriving him of therapy. 15 Id. at *7-9.\nWe explained that the favorable termination rule applies\nonly if a prisoner’s claim necessarily implicates the fact or\nduration of his confinement. Id. at *7. Although the\ndisciplinary sanction prevented the offender from obtaining\ntreatment that might expedite his release, it did not\nnecessarily affect the length of his incarceration, and thus\nHeck and Edwards did not apply. Id. at *7-8.16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. Our research reveals that only one circuit court continues to insist\nthat the favorable termination rule applies to claims that implicate only\nthe conditions of a prisoner’s confinement. In Huey v. Stine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770852\"><a href=\"/opinion/770852/joseph-t-huey-v-daniel-stine-correctional-officer-ionia-maximum/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2000), the Sixth Circuit held that Heck and Edwards\nbarred a prisoner from alleging under S 1983 that his Eighth Amendment\nrights were violated when he was put in detention and stripped of\nprivileges for thirty days. Id. at 228, 230. Relying on its prior\nunpublished opinions, the Court failed to consider whether it mattered\nthat the disciplinary measures at issue did not affect the duration of the\nprisoner’s incarceration. Id. at 228-29. The Sixth Circuit did not explain\nwhy it disagreed with every other court of appeals to address this issue.\nWe believe that Huey’s extension of Heck and Edwards to claims that\n\frelate only to prison conditions is unwarranted. The Supreme Court has\nnever questioned Preiser’s statement, see 411 U.S. at 499, that prisoners\ncan challenge the conditions of their confinement under S 1983, and the\nprimary concern underlying Heck and Edwards (the possibility that\nprisoners will use S 1983 to attack collaterally the fact or duration of\ntheir confinement) does not apply when the underlying disciplinary\nsanction relates only to the conditions of a prisoner’s incarceration.\n\n16. Cf. Neal v. Shimoda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749366\"><a href=\"/opinion/749366/97-cal-daily-op-serv-9274-97-daily-journal-dar-14953-aj-neal-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 824 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that\nprisoners could use S 1983 to challenge being compelled to participate in\na sex offender treatment program as a prerequisite for parole eligibility);\nGeorgevich v. Strauss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458549\"><a href=\"/opinion/458549/anthony-georgevich-on-his-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-the-class-he/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1087 (3d Cir. 1985) (en banc)\n(holding that prisoners can contest parole procedures under S 1983\nwhere the success of their claims would not necessarily affect \"the actual\nduration of [their] confinement\").\n\n                                13\n\n\nC.\n\nIn this context, we hold that Torres’s due process claim\nis cognizable under S 1983. Preiser concluded that a\nprisoner may use S 1983 to attack \"the conditions of his\nprison life,\" 411 U.S. at 499, and both Heck and Edwards\nadhered to \"Preiser’s clear line between challenges to the\nfact or length of custody and challenges to the conditions of\nconfinement.\" Brown, 131 F.3d at 168. The favorable\ntermination rule does not apply when a prisoner’sS 1983\nclaims can implicate only the conditions, and not the fact\nor duration, of his confinement. This is regardless whether\nhe remains in custody, as in Leamer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">624068</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n*7, and DeWalt, 224 F.3d at 616-17, or is no longer in\ncustody, as in Jenkins, 179 F.3d at 27, and Brown, 131\nF.3d at 168. Torres’s claim challenges the procedures by\nwhich he was sentenced to disciplinary detention and\nadministrative segregation. Because these punishments did\nnot alter the length of his incarceration, the success of his\nclaim would not \"necessarily imply the invalidity of \" the\nfact or duration of his confinement. Edwards, 520 U.S. at\n646; Heck, 512 U.S. at 486-87. Thus the District Court\nerred in concluding that the favorable termination rule\nbarred Torres from proceeding under S 1983.\n\nIV. No Violation of Protected Liberty Interest\n\nAlthough Torres’s due process claim is cognizable under\nS 1983, to survive summary judgment he had to present\nevidence that he suffered a violation of a liberty interest\nprotected by the Constitution’s Due Process Clause.\nBecause he did not, we affirm.\n\nA protected liberty interest in avoiding prison disciplinary\nsanctions can arise either from the Due Process Clause\nitself or from state law. Asquith v. Dep’t of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765509\"><a href=\"/opinion/765509/william-eugene-asquith-v-department-of-corrections-volunteers-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 409 (3d Cir. 1999) (citation omitted). No liberty\ninterest traced from the Due Process Clause is implicated if\n\"the conditions or degree of confinement to which a\nprisoner is subjected [are] within the sentence imposed\nupon him\" and do not otherwise violate the Constitution.\n\fFraise v. Terhune, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776906\"><a href=\"/opinion/776906/jael-fraise-v-jack-terhune-commissioner-alexander-kettles-v-james-barbo/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (3d Cir. 2002)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In other\n\n                                14\n\n\nwords, where there is no state-created liberty interest, the\nDue Process Clause applies only if the restraints at issue\nexceed the prisoner’s sentence \"in such an unexpected\nmanner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process\nClause of [their] own force\" and do not violate any other\nconstitutional provision. Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n484 (1995). Because disciplinary detention and\n\"administrative segregation [are] the sort[s] of confinement\nthat inmates should reasonably anticipate receiving at\nsome point in their incarceration,\" Torres’s transfer to \"less\namenable and more restrictive quarters\" did not implicate a\nliberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. Hewitt\nv. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 468 (1983); Fraise , 283 F.3d at\n522.\n\nNor was Torres deprived of any state-created liberty\ninterest. In Sandin, the Supreme Court sharply curtailed\nthe situations in which the negative implications of\nmandatory language in state laws or regulations can create\na protected liberty interest in the prison context. The case\ninvolved a prisoner’s claim that Hawaii prison officials\ndeprived him of due process when they charged him with\nmisconduct and, following a hearing, placed him in\ndisciplinary segregation in the \"Special Holding Unit\" for 30\ndays. Id. at 475-76. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\nconcluded that because a prison regulation in Hawaii\nrequired that substantial evidence must support a\nmisconduct charge, the prisoner was deprived of a\nprotected liberty interest if he was put in segregation\npursuant to a decision lacking such evidentiary support. Id.\nat 476-77. The Supreme Court reversed, explaining that the\nfocus must be on the nature of the deprivation, not merely\non the language of state laws and regulations. Id. at 481-\n84. The Court explained that mandatory language in a state\nlaw or regulation can create a protected liberty interest only\nif the alleged deprivation \"imposes atypical and significant\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents\nof prison life.\" Id. at 484. The Court determined that\nbecause the plaintiff ’s confinement \"mirrored those\nconditions imposed upon inmates in administrative\nsegregation and protective custody,\" and because inmates\nin the general population at the plaintiff ’s prison\nexperienced \"significant amounts of ‘lockdown time,’ \" the\n\n                                15\n\n\nprisoner was not deprived of a protected liberty interest. Id.\nat 486.\n\nSandin instructs that whether the restraint at issue\n\"imposes atypical and significant hardship\" depends on the\nparticular state in which the plaintiff is incarcerated. Id. We\nrecently held in Fraise that New Jersey prisoners were not\n\fdeprived of a protected liberty interest when they were\nplaced in the \"Security Threat Group Management Unit\"\n(\"STGMU\"), an especially harsh form of administrative\ndetention \"designed to isolate and rehabilitate gang\nmembers.\"17 283 F.3d at 509, 522-23. Prisoners placed in\nthe STGMU were consigned to \"maximum custody\" until\nthey completed a \"three-phase behavior modification and\neducation program,\" in which they learned, inter alia, non-\nviolent methods of conflict resolution. Id. at 511. If a\nprisoner refused to renounce his affiliation with all\n\"security threat groups,\" he would remain in the STGMU\nindefinitely. Id. at 511. Among other restrictions, inmates\ntransferred to the STGMU were allowed just five hours per\nweek outside their cells, were strip-searched every time\nthey exited or reentered their cells, could shower or shave\nonly every third day, were banned from regular prison\nprograms, and were prohibited from corresponding with\nany other inmate. Id. at 523 n.1 (Rendell, J., dissenting).\nWe held that these \"additional restrictions\" did \"not impose\nan atypical and significant hardship in relation to the\nordinary incidents of prison life,\" and thus did not implicate\na protected liberty interest. Id. at 522-23 (citations omitted).18\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. Judge Rendell dissented on a different issue, but agreed with the\nmajority’s analysis of the due process issue. Id. at 530 n.13 (Rendell, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n18. Cf.
