The District\nCourt dismissed Fair Wind’s trade dress and unjust\nenrichment claims, and subsequently awarded Defendants\nfees under Virgin Islands law. Fair Wind challenges both the\ndismissal of its claims and the award of attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n                             2\n\f        The District Court properly concluded that Fair Wind\nfailed to state claims for trade dress infringement and unjust\nenrichment. As to the former claim, Fair Wind has failed to\nadequately explain what “dress” it seeks to protect, and its\ntrade dress, as pleaded, is functional in nature. As to the latter\nclaim, Fair Wind has not pleaded with sufficient particularity\nin what manner Defendants have been unjustly enriched. We\ntherefore affirm the dismissal of both claims.\n\n        However, we agree with Fair Wind that the District\nCourt improperly awarded fees for the entirety of the\nlitigation under Virgin Islands law. While it would have been\nappropriate for the District Court to award reasonable fees\naccrued defending the territorial law claims, an award for the\nportion of the fees accrued defending the Lanham Act claim\nwas appropriate only to the extent that this was an\n“exceptional” case. 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a). The District Court\ndid not decide whether this case was an “exceptional” one.\nWe therefore remand the fee dispute for further proceedings.\nIn the wake of new Supreme Court precedent, we take this\nopportunity to amend our recently-abrogated jurisprudence on\nthe standard for finding “exceptionality” under § 35(a) of the\nLanham Act.\n                               I.\n\n                               A.\n\n       The complaint alleges the following facts, which we\nassume to be true and construe in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-80\n(2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\f       Fair Wind is a Michigan corporation that owns sailing\nschools throughout the United States, including one in St.\nThomas, Virgin Islands. The St. Thomas school exclusively\nuses catamarans. 1\n\n       In July 2007, Fair Wind hired Larry Bouffard as a\ncaptain and sailing instructor for its St. Thomas school.\nBouffard entered into a contract with Fair Wind, which\ncontained a provision precluding Bouffard from joining a Fair\nWind competitor within 20 miles of the St. Thomas school for\ntwo years after the end of his employment with Fair Wind. A\npopular instructor, Bouffard stayed with Fair Wind for over\nthree years.\n\n       In June 2010, Bouffard introduced Dempster to Fair\nWind as a potential instructor and captain. Relying on\nBouffard’s assurance that Dempster was qualified for the\npost, Fair Wind hired Dempster for a probationary two-week\nperiod.    Fair Wind was dissatisfied with Dempster’s\nperformance, and declined to retain Dempster at the end of\nthose two weeks.\n\n       Shortly after Fair Wind terminated Dempster, Bouffard\nresigned. At or about this time, however, Dempster and\nBouffard decided to open a sailing school together in St.\nThomas. By the following winter, Dempster and Bouffard’s\n\n1\n For our landlocked readers, a catamaran is a boat “with twin\nhulls and usually a deck or superstructure connecting the\nhulls.”     Catamaran Definition, Merriam-Webster.com,\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catamaran (last\nvisited July 9, 2014).\n\n\n\n\n                             4\n\fschool, VISS, was up and running, in direct competition with\nFair Wind. Opening VISS violated Bouffard’s two-year non-\ncompete agreement with Fair Wind.\n\n       Since its inception, VISS has copied Fair Wind’s St.\nThomas school in several respects. VISS employs 45-foot\ncatamarans, the same boats used by Fair Wind. VISS also\nuses teaching curriculum and itineraries identical to those\nused by Fair Wind, and employs the same procedures for\nstudent feedback. The marketing on VISS’s website is\nidentical to Fair Wind’s marketing. Additionally, the VISS\nwebsite contains a picture of a catamaran belonging to Fair\nWind, includes “student testimonials” from students who took\nclasses with Dempster while he worked for Fair Wind, and\nmentions Bouffard’s experience teaching “[o]ver the last\nyear,” presumably in reference to his time teaching at Fair\nWind. First Am. Compl. ¶ 32.\n\n       Fair Wind alleges that “[s]ince VISS began competing\nwith Fair Wind, Fair Wind has lost considerable business and\nreputation.” Id. ¶ 35. It also alleges that “Dempster and\nVISS have been enriched by their improper and unjustified\nconduct.” Id. ¶ 48.\n\n                             B.\n\n       Fair Wind filed an action against Dempster and VISS\nin the District Court of the Virgin Islands. The complaint, as\namended shortly thereafter, alleged three claims against\nDempster and Fair Wind: (1) a “trade dress” infringement\nclaim under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act; (2) a common-law\ntortious interference claim; and (3) a common-law unjust\nenrichment claim. VISS filed a motion to partially dismiss\n\n\n\n\n                              5\n\fthe complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, arguing that Fair Wind failed to state claims\nfor trade dress infringement or unjust enrichment.\n\n        The District Court concluded that Fair Wind had failed\nto state claims for either trade dress infringement or unjust\nenrichment. As to the trade dress claim, the District Court\nconcluded that the complaint had several dispositive flaws.\nFirst, the District Court explained that Fair Wind had failed to\nallege facts about its business that “amount[ed] to its trade\ndress.” Fair Wind Sailing, Inc. v. Dempster, No. 2011-55,\n2013 WL 1091310, at *4 (D.V.I. Mar. 15, 2013). “Without\nknowing the precise product features that Fair Wind seeks to\nprotect” as trade dress, the District Court “struggle[d] to\nundertake a productive Rule 12(b)(6) analysis.” Id. Second,\nassuming that the product features at issue amounted to a\ntrade dress, the Court determined that the complaint was\n“devoid of any allegations that [these features were]\ninherently distinctive or ha[d] acquired any secondary\nmeaning.” Id. at *4-5. Third, the District Court determined\nthat the product features comprising Fair Wind’s alleged trade\ndress were “functional” and therefore fell beyond the\nprotections of the Lanham Act. Id. at *5-6. With respect to\nthe unjust enrichment claim, the District Court concluded that\nFair Wind had failed to “allege any facts to support the first\nelement required for an unjust enrichment claim—that the\ndefendant was enriched.” Id. at *7. Accordingly, the District\nCourt granted VISS’s motion to dismiss in its entirety. In\nresponse, Fair Wind voluntarily dismissed its remaining claim\nfor tortious interference, making the judgment final and\nappealable. See Camesi v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 729\nF.3d 239, 246 (3d Cir. 2013).\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\f       Thereafter, Defendants moved for $41,783 in\nattorneys’ fees under § 35(a) of the Lanham Act and Title 5,\nsection 541 of the Virgin Islands Code. This constituted the\n“total amount of legal fees incurred by Defendants in this\nmatter” over the course of the litigation. App. 64. Relying\nsolely on the Virgin Islands fee statute, the District Court\nconcluded that Defendants were entitled to a “fair and\nreasonable award of attorney’s fees” for their effort defending\nthe entirety of this case. Fair Wind Sailing, Inc. v. Dempster,\nNo. 2011-55, 2014 WL 886832, at *1 (D.V.I. Mar. 6, 2014).\nAfter concluding that a portion of the fees sought was\nunreasonably expended, the District Court awarded\nDefendants fees in the amount of $36,347. Id. at *3.\n\n       Fair Wind filed separate, timely appeals of both the\ndismissal order and the fees order, which were subsequently\nconsolidated for disposition. 2\n\n                              II.\n\n       We first consider Fair Wind’s trade dress claim. Like\nthe District Court, we conclude that Fair Wind has failed to\nproperly state a claim for trade dress infringement. We\ntherefore affirm the District Court’s dismissal of the claim. 3\n\n2\n The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1367(a). We have appellate jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n3\n In deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), courts\nmust “accept all factual allegations as true, construe the\ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and\ndetermine whether, under any reasonable reading of the\n\n\n\n\n                              7\n\f       Section 43(a) of the federal Lanham Trademark Act\nsets forth the standard for infringement of unregistered\ntrademarks. It provides in relevant part that:\n\n       (1) Any person who, on or in connection with\n       any goods or services, or any container for\n       goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name,\n       symbol, or device, or any combination thereof,\n       or any false designation of origin, false or\n       misleading description of fact, or false or\n       misleading representation of fact, which — (A)\n       is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake,\n       or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or\n       association of such person with another person,\n       or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of\n       his or her goods, services, or commercial\n       activities by another person, or (B) in\n       commercial        advertising      or     promotion,\n       misrepresents the nature, characteristics,\n       qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or\n       another person’s goods, services, or commercial\n       activities, shall be liable in a civil action by any\n\n\n\ncomplaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.” Phillips v.\nCnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “Threadbare recitals of the\nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory\nstatements, do not suffice.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. “A claim\nhas facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content\nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. (citing\nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n\f       person who believes that he or she is or is likely\n       to be damaged by such act.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1).         Section 43(a) protects from\ndeceptive imitation not only a business’s trademarks, but also\nits “trade dress.” 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(3); Two Pesos, Inc. v.\nTaco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S.763, 776 (1992) (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring). “Trade dress has been defined as the total image\nor overall appearance of a product, and includes, but is not\nlimited to, such features as size, shape, color or color\ncombinations, texture, graphics, or even a particular sales\ntechnique.” Rose Art Indus., Inc. v. Swanson, 235 F.3d 165,\n171 (3d Cir. 2000). In short, trade dress is the overall look of\na product or business. See, e.g., Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S.\nat 765 (the decor of a restaurant); Am. Greetings Corp. v.\nDan-Dee Imports, Inc., 807 F.2d 1136, 1140 (3d Cir. 1986) (a\nline of teddy bears with “tummy graphics”); see also Bristol-\nMyers Squibb Co. v. McNeil-P.P.C., Inc., 973 F.2d 1033,\n1037 (2d Cir. 1992) (graphics and arrangement of elements\non a box of Excedrin).\n\n        “The purpose of trade dress protection is to ‘secure the\nowner of the trade dress the goodwill of his business and to\nprotect the ability of consumers to distinguish among\ncompeting producers.’”        McNeil Nutritionals, LLC v.\nHeartland Sweeteners, LLC, 511 F.3d 350, 357 (3d Cir. 2007)\n(quoting Shire US Inc. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 329 F.3d 348, 353\n(3d Cir. 2003)). Trade dress protection does not shield\nbusinesses from plagiarism. See Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth\nCentury Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 36 (2003). Indeed,\n“[t]rade dress protection must subsist with the recognition\nthat in many instances there is no prohibition against copying\ngoods and products.” TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Mktg. Displays,\n\n\n\n\n                               9\n\fInc., 532 U.S. 23, 29 (2001); see also Thomas & Betts Corp.\nv. Panduit Corp., 65 F.3d 654, 657 (7th Cir. 1995) (“Copying\nis not only good, it is a federal right—a necessary\ncomplement to the patent system’s grant of limited\nmonopolies.”).     Thus, the law does not afford every\ncombination of visual elements exclusive legal rights.\nInstead, “trade dress protection extends only to incidental,\narbitrary or ornamental product features which identify the\nproduct’s source.” Shire US, 329 F.3d at 353.\n\n          A plaintiff must prove three elements to establish trade\ndress infringement under the Lanham Act: “(1) the allegedly\ninfringing design is nonfunctional; (2) the design is inherently\ndistinctive or has acquired secondary meaning; and (3)\nconsumers are likely to confuse the source of the plaintiff’s\nproduct with that of the defendant’s product.” McNeil\nNutritionals, 511 F.3d at 357. In addition to satisfying these\nthree elements, it is the plaintiff’s duty to “articulat[e] the\nspecific elements which comprise its distinct dress.” See\nLandscape Forms, Inc. v. Columbia Cascade Co., 113 F.3d\n373, 381 (2d Cir. 1997); see also 1 J. Thomas McCarthy,\nMcCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 8:3 (4th\ned. 2014) (“[T]he discrete elements which make up the [trade\ndress claim] should be separated out and identified in a\nlist.”). 4 This allows the district court to ensure that the claim\n\n4\n  For example, in Rose Art Industries, the plaintiff claimed\nthat the following elements comprised its trade dress:\n\n       (1) a prominent band that is either straight or\n       wavy and often black in color that cuts across\n       the middle of the front of the package,\n       extending to the sides with the words\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fis not “pitched at an improper level of generality, i.e., the\nclaimant [does not] seek[] protection for an unprotectable\nstyle, theme or idea.” Landscape Forms, 113 F.3d at 381.\nEven before it reaches the question of protectability, however,\na district court should scrutinize a plaintiff’s description of its\ntrade dress to ensure itself that the plaintiff seeks protection\n\n\n       “CRAYONS” or “WASHABLE MARKERS”\n       or other descriptive term in white letters\n       imprinted on the band (the “Band and Letter\n       feature”); (2) a yellow background on the top of\n       the package with a contrasting background\n       color (either red, purple, pink, or a combination\n       of purple fading to red) on the bottom of the\n       package; and (3) a prominent display of the\n       Rose Art logo in golden yellow (either foil or\n       print) or red, either with or without a rainbow\n       “swish” design behind the logo on the front of\n       the package. In addition, in its presentation to\n       the District Court, Rose Art included three other\n       elements in its claim of infringement: (1) the\n       statement “since 1923”; (2) the statement on the\n       front of the package that the product is\n       “Certified Non–Toxic;” and (3) the sentence\n       inviting consumer comments, “Rose Art invites\n       your comments and questions about this\n       product. Please write to Rose Art Industries,\n       Inc., Consumer Affairs, 6 Regent St.,\n       Livingston, NJ 07039 or call 1–800–\n       CRAYONS.”\n\n235 F.3d at 169.\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\fof visual elements of its business. As the Sixth Circuit has\nnoted, “any ‘thing’ that dresses a good can constitute trade\ndress.” Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. v. Am. Eagle\nOutfitters, Inc., 280 F.3d 619, 630 (6th Cir. 2002). However,\nthe “thing” must “dress[] a good.” Id. That is, the alleged\ntrade dress must create some visual impression on consumers.\nOtherwise, there is simply no “dress” to protect.\n\n       According to Fair Wind, its trade dress is “the\ncombination of its choice to solely employ catamaran\nvessels” and its “unique teaching curriculum, student\ntestimonials, and registered domain name,” which “all\ncombine to identify Fair Wind’s uniquely configured business\nto the general public.” Appellant’s Br. at 20-21. 5 By its own\nterms, then, Fair Wind’s “trade dress” is simply a hodgepodge\nof unconnected pieces of its business, which together do not\ncomprise any sort of composite visual effect. Fair Wind is\nnot arguing that VISS stole Fair Wind’s “look” in order to\nlure away customers. In fact, several of the elements of Fair\n\n5\n   Although Fair Wind asserts in its briefs on appeal that\nVISS’s domain name is nearly identical to Fair Wind’s, the\ncomplaint makes no such allegation, nor can one reasonably\ninfer such an allegation. While the complaint mentions\nVISS’s domain name, see First Am. Compl. ¶ 5, it never\ndiscusses Fair Wind’s web address. Because we cannot\nconsider allegations outside the complaint, the similarity in\nthe parties’ domain names cannot play a part in our analysis.\nIn any event, the fact that the parties have similar web\naddresses, even if properly pleaded, does not alter our\nconclusion that Fair Wind has failed to allege a cognizable\ntrade dress.\n\n\n\n\n                             12\n\fWind’s trade dress—such as the teaching curriculum—are not\nclearly visual aspects of the business at all. 6 Rather, Fair\nWind asserts that Defendants have harmed Fair Wind “by\ncopying every material element of Fair Wind’s business and\npresenting [it to] the public.” Id. at 15. This claim has little\nto do with trade dress.\n\n       Perhaps realizing its failure to plead a cognizable trade\ndress, Fair Wind pivoted at oral argument, placing its “web\ndesign” at the center of the trade dress claim. But the\ncomplaint does not enumerate what specific elements of its\nwebsite comprise a distinctive trade dress or that its site has\nany distinctive ornamental features. Cf. Xuan-Thao N.\nNguyen, Should It Be a Free for All? The Challenge of\nExtending Trade Dress Protection to the Look and Feel of\nWeb Sites in the Evolving Internet, 49 Am. U. L. Rev. 1233,\n1236, 1240 (2000) (arguing that a combination of a website’s\n“color, graphics, animations, designs, layout, [and] text” may\nqualify for trade dress protection).\n\n       Indeed, Fair Wind has failed to allege any facts at all\nrelating to the substance of its own website. True, the\n\n6\n We do not suggest that the curriculum of a sailing school, if\npart of, for example, an overall look of a schoolhouse or a\nwebsite, could not be part of a business’s trade dress. Cf.\nFuddruckers, Inc. v. Doc’s B.R. Others, Inc., 826 F.2d 837,\n841 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that a menu, in combination with\nother aspects of a restaurant’s decor, can constitute\nprotectable trade dress). But the complaint does not in any\nway indicate that Fair Wind’s curriculum creates any kind of\nvisual impression. It is not even clear from the complaint that\nFair Wind’s curriculum is something that can be seen.\n\n\n\n\n                              13\n\fcomplaint suggests that VISS’s website contains a picture of a\nFair Wind catamaran, as well as student feedback\nmechanisms, curriculum, and itineraries identical to those\nused by Fair Wind. First. Am. Compl. ¶ 29. But the fact that\nVISS has copied aspects of Fair Wind’s business and placed\nthem on its website says nothing about the content of Fair\nWind’s website, let alone whether Fair Wind’s website has a\ncomposite look that might constitute a trade dress.\n\n      Because Fair Wind has failed to give Defendants\nadequate notice of what overall look it wishes to protect, its\ntrade dress claim cannot survive Defendants’ motion to\ndismiss. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n\n        But even assuming that Fair Wind had adequately\nstated the overall design it seeks to protect, its alleged “trade\ndress” is clearly functional, and therefore not protectable. A\nfunctional feature is one that is “essential to the use or\npurpose of the article,” “affects the cost or quality of the\narticle,” or one that, if kept from competitors, would put them\nat a “significant non-reputation-related disadvantage.”\nTrafFix, 532 U.S. at 33.            By contrast, a feature is\nnonfunctional where it “is unrelated to the consumer demand\n. . . and serves merely to identify the source of the product”\nor business. Prufrock Ltd., Inc. v. Lasater, 781 F.2d 129, 133\n(8th Cir. 1986). Student feedback procedures, catamarans,\nteaching itineraries, and curriculum all affect the quality of\nFair Wind’s business. They play a critical role in the\nconsumer demand for Fair Wind’s services, rather than\nmerely identifying Fair Wind as the source of the sailing\ninstruction. Cf. TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 32 (holding that the\ndual-spring design was not protectable because it had a\npurpose “beyond serving the purpose of informing consumers\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fthat the sign stands are made by” the plaintiff). Thus, Fair\nWind’s alleged dress is plainly functional.\n\n       Rather than argue that the particular features of its\n“trade dress” are nonfunctional, Fair Wind argues that the\nvarious functional aspects of its business combine to create\nsomething nonfunctional. Fair Wind’s argument rests on\nClicks Billiards, Inc. v. Sixshooters, Inc., where the Ninth\nCircuit concluded that the sum of particular functional\nelements in a pool hall, such as its counters and lighting,\ncould amount to a nonfunctional look. See 251 F.3d 1252,\n1261-62 (9th Cir. 2001). The Clicks court explained, “[t]he\nfact that individual elements of the trade dress may be\nfunctional does not necessarily mean that the trade dress as a\nwhole is functional; rather, functional elements that are\nseparately unprotectable can be protected together as part of\ntrade dress.” Id. at 1259 (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also id. at 1261 (“To be sure, many of these elements,\nconsidered in isolation, may be functional. The issue,\nhowever, is whether, taken as a whole, the overall look and\nfeel of the establishment is functional.”). The plaintiff in\nClicks offered evidence that its “composite tapestry of visual\neffects” had become associated with its pool halls and not\nothers. See id. at 1259, 1261-62. Thus, the Ninth Circuit\nconcluded that the plaintiff’s trade dress claim should survive\nsummary judgment.\n\n       In stark contrast to the plaintiff in Clicks, Fair Wind\nhas not explained how the identified functional elements\nachieve a nonfunctional “composite tapestry of visual\neffects.” Id. at 1259. Fair Wind has not suggested, in its\ncomplaint or elsewhere, that its business has a distinctive\nappearance at all. Clicks is therefore inapposite.\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\f       In sum, Fair Wind has failed to allege a cognizable\ntrade dress. Moreover, to the extent that the complaint\nalleges that Fair Wind’s boats, curriculum, itineraries, and\nstudent feedback procedures are its trade dress, that trade\ndress is functional, and therefore not protectable. Fair Wind’s\nclaim does not hold water.\n\n                             III.\n\n        Fair Wind next argues that the District Court\nimproperly dismissed its unjust enrichment claim by\nemploying too exacting a pleading standard. Specifically, the\nDistrict Court concluded that Fair Wind had failed to properly\nplead that Defendants had been enriched by their conduct.\nWe agree with the District Court that Fair Wind has failed to\nstate a claim for unjust enrichment. We therefore affirm.\n\n       To recover for unjust enrichment under Virgin Islands\nlaw, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant was\nenriched, (2) the enrichment was at the plaintiff’s expense,\nand (3) the circumstances were such that, in equity and good\nconscience, the defendant should return the money or\nproperty to the plaintiff. Martin v. Martin, 54 V.I. 379, 393-\n94 (V.I. 2010).        To state the obvious, a defendant’s\nenrichment is critical to the success of an unjust enrichment\nclaim. See Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust\nEnrichment § 1 cmt. d. (“Restitution is concerned with the\nreceipt of benefits that yield a measurable increase in the\nrecipient’s wealth.”).\n\n       The premise of Fair Wind’s unjust enrichment claim is\nthat Defendants gained, and Fair Wind lost, by Defendants\n“trading on Fair Wind’s trade dress, proprietary information\n\n\n\n\n                              16\n\fand trade secrets.” First Am. Compl. ¶ 50. As the District\nCourt noted, however, the complaint contains no facts\nconcerning in what respect Defendants were enriched, other\nthan the conclusory assertion that “Dempster and VISS have\nbeen enriched by their improper and unjustified conduct.” Id.\nat ¶ 48.\n\n        At the pleadings stage, it is often not possible for a\nplaintiff to recount with specificity to what extent a defendant\nwas enriched by her misconduct. That is what discovery is\nfor. At the same time, however, Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure requires a plaintiff to plead some\nfactual allegations in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\nSee Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557; Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.\nPleading the “mere elements” of a cause of action will not do.\nPhillips, 515 F.3d at 233. Here, Fair Wind has failed to even\nallege that Defendants’ business accrued additional profits by\npoaching Fair Wind’s proprietary information and trade\nsecrets. That may have satisfied Rule 8(a)(2)’s fairly lenient\nnotice-pleading standard. See id. at 234. But the bald\nassertion that Defendants “have been enriched” does not.\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the District Court’s dismissal\nof Fair Wind’s unjust enrichment claim.\n\n                              IV.\n\n       We next address the District Court’s award of\nattorneys’ fees to the Defendants in the amount of $36,347. 7\n\n7\n  “We exercise plenary review over legal issues relating to the\nappropriate standard under which to evaluate an application\nfor attorneys’ fees. . . . We review the reasonableness of the\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fAfter reducing Defendants’ fee award by roughly $5,000 for\nexcessive billing and vague time entries, the District Court\nawarded Defendants the remainder of their hours billed for\nthe entirety of the litigation, relying solely on Title 5, section\n541 of the Virgin Islands Code. See Fair Wind Sailing, Inc.,\n2014 WL 886832, at *1-3. The District Court did not attempt\nto segregate which fees were accrued defending the federal\nclaim, nor did it discuss the Lanham Act as a basis for a fee\naward. Id.\n\n                               A.\n\n        Section 541 provides in relevant part that “there shall\nbe allowed to the prevailing party in the judgment such sums\nas the court in its discretion may fix by way of indemnity for\nhis attorney’s fees in maintaining the action or defenses\nthereto.” V.I. Code Ann. tit. 5, § 541(b). However, section\n541 does not permit a district court to award the prevailing\nparty all of its attorneys’ fees where the case includes both\nterritorial and federal causes of action. Rather, “[i]n awarding\nfees to a prevailing party under section 541, . . . the court\nmust subtract fees and costs associated with federal claims, as\nsection 541 is only applicable to fees for the litigant who\nsucceeds in pursuing [or defending] Virgin Islands territorial\nclaims.” Figueroa v. Buccaneer Hotel Inc., 188 F.3d 172,\n183 (3d Cir. 1999) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\nDistrict Court’s award of attorneys’ fees for abuse of\ndiscretion.” Nat’l Amusements Inc. v. Borough of Palmyra,\n716 F.3d 57, 64 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting People Against\nPolice Violence v. City of Pittsburgh, 520 F.3d 226, 231 (3d\nCir. 2008)).\n\n\n\n\n                               18\n\f       Defendants do not dispute that the District Court failed\nto “subtract fees and costs associated with” Fair Wind’s\nfederal claim. Id. They nonetheless insist that “the District\nCourt correctly chose to award Defendants . . . fees solely\nunder Section [541] . . . as the attorneys’ fees expended in\ndefending all three of [Fair Wind’s] causes of action were\ninextricably intertwined.” Appellees’ Supplemental Br. at 9.\nDefendants “cit[e] . . . defense counsel’s timesheets” as\nevidence that “the fees incurred defending against Plaintiff’s\nclaims for trade dress infringement, tortious interference with\ncontract and unjust enrichment were ‘inextricably\nintertwined.’” Id. at 23.\n\n        We have never approved of section 541 fees where the\nterritorial and federal claims are “inextricably intertwined.”\nAcknowledging that we have not endorsed this argument,\nDefendants rely on a Ninth Circuit opinion, Gracie v. Gracie,\n217 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2000), for their proposed exception to\nthe Figueroa rule. There, the Ninth Circuit held that “a party\ncannot recover legal fees incurred in litigating non-Lanham\nAct claims unless the Lanham Act claims and non-Lanham\nAct claims are so intertwined that it is impossible to\ndifferentiate between work done on claims.” Id. at 1069\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Despite Defendants’ insistence that the fees incurred\ndefending the territorial law and federal law claims cannot be\nsegregated, the District Court made no such finding. Unless\nand until it does, we see no reason to decide when, if ever, the\n“inextricably intertwined” exception to the Figueroa rule\nmight apply. See Gracie, 217 F.3d at 1070 (“[T]he\nimpossibility of making an exact apportionment does not\nrelieve the district court of its duty to make some attempt to\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fadjust the fee award         in    an   effort   to   reflect   an\napportionment.”).\n\n       Moreover, we remain unconvinced that where federal\nand territorial claims are “inextricably intertwined,” it\nnecessarily makes sense to award fees to the prevailing party\nfor the entirety of the litigation under section 541. The rule\nproposed by Defendants, it seems to us, would encourage\nparties to obfuscate time entries. Indeed, the fact that\nDefendants cite their own time entries as evidence that the\nclaims were inextricably intertwined lends credence to that\nconcern.     Moreover, Defendants’ proposed rule seems\nparticularly inequitable in a case, such as this one, where the\nmajority of the parties’ energy was spent litigating the federal\nclaim, not the territorial claims.\n\n       In sum, the District Court should have attempted to\napportion the fees incurred defending the territorial and\nfederal claims.\n\n                              B.\n\n       Once the time spent on the federal and territorial\nclaims is apportioned, the question remains whether\nDefendants may recover fees spent defending the federal\nclaim at all. As it happens, Fair Wind’s sole federal claim\nwas brought under the Lanham Act, § 35(a) of which permits\nthe recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees only “in\nexceptional cases.” 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a). Defendants argue\nthat this case meets the standard for exceptionality, and that\nthey are therefore entitled to reasonable fees expended on the\nentirety of the litigation.\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\f        As we have explained elsewhere, “Congress added the\nattorney’s fee provision of § 35(a) to the Lanham Act in 1975\nin response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Fleischmann\nDistilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714 (1967),\nholding that attorney’s fees were not available in trademark\ncases under the Lanham Act absent express statutory\nauthority.” Securacomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom Inc.,\n224 F.3d 273, 279 (3d Cir. 2000). However, while “the\nstatute now expressly provides for an award of attorney’s fees\nat the discretion of the court in ‘exceptional cases,’ 15 U.S.C.\n§ 1117(a), it does not define an ‘exceptional case[].’” Id. at\n279-80 (alteration in original).\n\n      Our case law requires a district court to engage in a\n“two-step process” before determining that a case is\n“exceptional” under § 35(a):\n\n       First, the District Court must decide whether the\n       defendant engaged in any culpable conduct. We\n       have listed bad faith, fraud, malice, and\n       knowing infringement as non-exclusive\n       examples of the sort of culpable conduct that\n       could support a fee award. Moreover, the\n       culpable conduct may relate not only to the\n       circumstances of the Lanham Act violation, but\n       also to the way the losing party handled himself\n       during the litigation. Second, if the District\n       Court finds culpable conduct, it must decide\n       whether the circumstances are “exceptional”\n       enough to warrant a fee award.\n\nGreen v. Fornario, 486 F.3d 100, 103 (3d Cir. 2007) (internal\ncitation omitted). The requirement that a district court find\n\n\n\n\n                              21\n\fculpability before awarding attorneys’ fees under the Lanham\nAct has been in place in this Circuit for over two decades.\nSee Ferrero U.S.A., Inc. v. Ozak Trading, Inc., 952 F.2d 44,\n48 (3d Cir. 1991) (holding that awarding fees under § 35(a) is\ninappropriate absent an “explicit finding . . . that [the losing\nparty] acted willfully or in bad faith”).\n\n       While this action was on appeal, the Supreme Court\nhanded down Octane Fitness, LLC v. Icon Health & Fitness,\nInc., 134 S.Ct. 1749 (2014), analyzing when a district court\nmay award fees under § 285 of the Patent Act. Like § 35(a)\nof the Lanham Act, § 285 provides that “[t]he court in\nexceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the\nprevailing party.” 35 U.S.C. § 285.\n\n        Prior to Octane Fitness, the Federal Circuit took the\nposition that “a case is ‘exceptional’ only if a district court\neither finds litigation-related misconduct of an independently\nsanctionable magnitude or determines that the litigation was\nboth ‘brought in subjective bad faith’ and ‘objectively\nbaseless.’” Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 1756 (quoting\nBrooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F.3d\n1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2005)). The Octane Fitness Court\nrejected this standard, embracing a definition of “exceptional”\nfar more expansive than the one articulated by the Federal\nCircuit in Brooks. Looking to the plain meaning of the term,\nthe Court explained that “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one\nthat stands out from others with respect to the substantive\nstrength of a party’s litigating position (considering both the\ngoverning law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable\nmanner in which the case was litigated.” Id. at 1756. Thus, it\nis within a court’s discretion to find a case “exceptional”\nbased upon “the governing law and the facts of the case,”\n\n\n\n\n                              22\n\firrespective of whether the losing party is culpable. For\nexample, “a case presenting . . . exceptionally meritless\nclaims may sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to\nwarrant a fee award.” Id. at 1757. This is so even if the\nlosing party’s conduct did not suggest “bad faith, fraud,\nmalice, [or] knowing infringement.” Green, 486 F.3d at 103.\n\n        While Octane Fitness directly concerns the scope of a\ndistrict court’s discretion to award fees for “exceptional” case\nunder § 285 of the Patent Act, the case controls our\ninterpretation of § 35(a) of the Lanham Act. Not only is §\n285 identical to § 35(a), but Congress referenced § 285 in\npassing § 35(a). See S. Rep. No. 93–1400, at 2 (1974),\nreprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7132, 7133; see also\nSecuracomm Consulting, 224 F.3d at 281. Thus, we have\n“look[ed] to the interpretation of the patent statute for\nguidance” in interpreting § 35(a). Id. Moreover, in its\nexplication of the word “exceptional,” the Octane Fitness\nCourt relied in part on the D.C. Circuit’s holding that the term\n“exceptional,” as used in § 35(a) of the Lanham Act, means\n“uncommon” or “not run-of-the-mill.” Octane Fitness, 134\nS. Ct. at 1756 (quoting Noxell Corp. v. Firehouse No. 1 Bar-\nB-Que Rest., 771 F.2d 521, 526 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). In so\ndoing, the Octane Fitness Court noted that the Lanham Act\nfee provision is “identical” to § 285 of the Patent Act. Id. We\nbelieve that the Court was sending a clear message that it was\ndefining “exceptional” not just for the fee provision in the\nPatent Act, but for the fee provision in the Lanham Act as\nwell.\n\n      We therefore import Octane Fitness’s definition of\n“exceptionality” into our interpretation of § 35(a) of the\nLanham Act. Under Octane Fitness, a district court may find\n\n\n\n\n                              23\n\fa case “exceptional,” and therefore award fees to the\nprevailing party, when (a) there is an unusual discrepancy in\nthe merits of the positions taken by the parties or (b) the\nlosing party has litigated the case in an “unreasonable\nmanner.” Id.; cf. Green, 486 F.3d at 103 (noting that a district\ncourt may award fees as a result of either the circumstances of\nthe Lanham Act violation or the way in which the losing party\nlitigated the claim). Whether litigation positions or litigation\ntactics are “exceptional” enough to merit attorneys’ fees must\nbe determined by district courts “in the case-by-case exercise\nof their discretion, considering the totality of the\ncircumstances.”      Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 1756.\nImportantly, that discretion is not cabined by a threshold\nrequirement that the losing party acted culpably. The losing\nparty’s blameworthiness may well play a role in a district\ncourt’s analysis of the “exceptionality” of a case, but Octane\nFitness has eliminated the first step in our two-step test for\nawarding fees under § 35(a) of the Lanham Act.\n\n         The parties ask us to decide whether this case merits\nattorneys’ fees under § 35(a) of the Lanham Act. We decline\nto do so. With its unparalleled knowledge of the litigation\nand the parties, the District Court is better suited to make that\nassessment in the first instance. See Securacomm Consulting,\n224 F.3d at 279. We therefore remand to the District Court,\nso that it may determine whether fees are appropriate under\nthis slightly altered standard for awarding fees in Lanham Act\ncases. 8\n                                V.\n\n\n8\n We similarly decline to reach the “reasonableness” of the\nDistrict Court’s fee award.\n\n\n\n\n                               24\n\f         We affirm the District Court’s dismissal of Fair\nWind’s trade dress and unjust enrichment claims. However,\nwe vacate the District Court’s award of attorneys’ fees. On\nremand, the District Court must determine whether this case\nis an “exceptional” one under § 35(a) of the Lanham Act. If\nit is, the Court may award reasonable fees for the entirety of\nthe litigation. If it is not, the Court must subtract from its\naward any fees accrued by Defendants in litigating the\nLanham Act claim.\n\n\n\n\n                             25\n\f",

The District\nCourt dismissed Fair Wind’s trade dress and unjust\nenrichment claims, and subsequently awarded Defendants\nfees under Virgin Islands law. Fair Wind challenges both the\ndismissal of its claims and the award of attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n                             2\n\f        The District Court properly concluded that Fair Wind\nfailed to state claims for trade dress infringement and unjust\nenrichment. As to the former claim, Fair Wind has failed to\nadequately explain what “dress” it seeks to protect, and its\ntrade dress, as pleaded, is functional in nature. As to the latter\nclaim, Fair Wind has not pleaded with sufficient particularity\nin what manner Defendants have been unjustly enriched. We\ntherefore affirm the dismissal of both claims.\n\n        However, we agree with Fair Wind that the District\nCourt improperly awarded fees for the entirety of the\nlitigation under Virgin Islands law. While it would have been\nappropriate for the District Court to award reasonable fees\naccrued defending the territorial law claims, an award for the\nportion of the fees accrued defending the Lanham Act claim\nwas appropriate only to the extent that this was an\n“exceptional” case. 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a). The District Court\ndid not decide whether this case was an “exceptional” one.\nWe therefore remand the fee dispute for further proceedings.\nIn the wake of new Supreme Court precedent, we take this\nopportunity to amend our recently-abrogated jurisprudence on\nthe standard for finding “exceptionality” under § 35(a) of the\nLanham Act.\n                               I.\n\n                               A.\n\n       The complaint alleges the following facts, which we\nassume to be true and construe in the light most favorable to\nthe plaintiff. See Ashcroft v.

The St. Thomas school exclusively\nuses catamarans. 1\n\n       In July 2007, Fair Wind hired Larry Bouffard as a\ncaptain and sailing instructor for its St. Thomas school.\nBouffard entered into a contract with Fair Wind, which\ncontained a provision precluding Bouffard from joining a Fair\nWind competitor within 20 miles of the St. Thomas school for\ntwo years after the end of his employment with Fair Wind. A\npopular instructor, Bouffard stayed with Fair Wind for over\nthree years.\n\n       In June 2010, Bouffard introduced Dempster to Fair\nWind as a potential instructor and captain. Relying on\nBouffard’s assurance that Dempster was qualified for the\npost, Fair Wind hired Dempster for a probationary two-week\nperiod.    Fair Wind was dissatisfied with Dempster’s\nperformance, and declined to retain Dempster at the end of\nthose two weeks.\n\n       Shortly after Fair Wind terminated Dempster, Bouffard\nresigned. At or about this time, however, Dempster and\nBouffard decided to open a sailing school together in St.\nThomas. By the following winter, Dempster and Bouffard’s\n\n1\n For our landlocked readers, a catamaran is a boat “with twin\nhulls and usually a deck or superstructure connecting the\nhulls.”     Catamaran Definition, Merriam-Webster.com,\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catamaran (last\nvisited July 9, 2014).\n\n\n\n\n                             4\n\fschool, VISS, was up and running, in direct competition with\nFair Wind. Opening VISS violated Bouffard’s two-year non-\ncompete agreement with Fair Wind.\n\n       Since its inception, VISS has copied Fair Wind’s St.\nThomas school in several respects. VISS employs 45-foot\ncatamarans, the same boats used by Fair Wind. VISS also\nuses teaching curriculum and itineraries identical to those\nused by Fair Wind, and employs the same procedures for\nstudent feedback. The marketing on VISS’s website is\nidentical to Fair Wind’s marketing. Additionally, the VISS\nwebsite contains a picture of a catamaran belonging to Fair\nWind, includes “student testimonials” from students who took\nclasses with Dempster while he worked for Fair Wind, and\nmentions Bouffard’s experience teaching “[o]ver the last\nyear,” presumably in reference to his time teaching at Fair\nWind. First Am. Compl. ¶ 32.\n\n       Fair Wind alleges that “[s]ince VISS began competing\nwith Fair Wind, Fair Wind has lost considerable business and\nreputation.” Id. ¶ 35. It also alleges that “Dempster and\nVISS have been enriched by their improper and unjustified\nconduct.” Id. ¶ 48.\n\n                             B.\n\n       Fair Wind filed an action against Dempster and VISS\nin the District Court of the Virgin Islands. The complaint, as\namended shortly thereafter, alleged three claims against\nDempster and Fair Wind: (1) a “trade dress” infringement\nclaim under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act; (2) a common-law\ntortious interference claim; and (3) a common-law unjust\nenrichment claim. VISS filed a motion to partially dismiss\n\n\n\n\n                              5\n\fthe complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, arguing that Fair Wind failed to state claims\nfor trade dress infringement or unjust enrichment.\n\n        The District Court concluded that Fair Wind had failed\nto state claims for either trade dress infringement or unjust\nenrichment. As to the trade dress claim, the District Court\nconcluded that the complaint had several dispositive flaws.\nFirst, the District Court explained that Fair Wind had failed to\nallege facts about its business that “amount[ed] to its trade\ndress.” Fair Wind Sailing, Inc. v. Dempster, No. 2011-55,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1091310</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (D.V.I. Mar. 15, 2013). “Without\nknowing the precise product features that Fair Wind seeks to\nprotect” as trade dress, the District Court “struggle[d] to\nundertake a productive Rule 12(b)(6) analysis.” Id. Second,\nassuming that the product features at issue amounted to a\ntrade dress, the Court determined that the complaint was\n“devoid of any allegations that [these features were]\ninherently distinctive or ha[d] acquired any secondary\nmeaning.” Id. at *4-5. Third, the District Court determined\nthat the product features comprising Fair Wind’s alleged trade\ndress were “functional” and therefore fell beyond the\nprotections of the Lanham Act. Id. at *5-6. With respect to\nthe unjust enrichment claim, the District Court concluded that\nFair Wind had failed to “allege any facts to support the first\nelement required for an unjust enrichment claim—that the\ndefendant was enriched.” Id. at *7. Accordingly, the District\nCourt granted VISS’s motion to dismiss in its entirety. In\nresponse, Fair Wind voluntarily dismissed its remaining claim\nfor tortious interference, making the judgment final and\nappealable. See Camesi v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med.

This constituted the\n“total amount of legal fees incurred by Defendants in this\nmatter” over the course of the litigation. App. 64. Relying\nsolely on the Virgin Islands fee statute, the District Court\nconcluded that Defendants were entitled to a “fair and\nreasonable award of attorney’s fees” for their effort defending\nthe entirety of this case.

Mar. 6, 2014).\nAfter concluding that a portion of the fees sought was\nunreasonably expended, the District Court awarded\nDefendants fees in the amount of $36,347. Id. at *3.\n\n       Fair Wind filed separate, timely appeals of both the\ndismissal order and the fees order, which were subsequently\nconsolidated for disposition. 2\n\n                              II.\n\n       We first consider Fair Wind’s trade dress claim. Like\nthe District Court, we conclude that Fair Wind has failed to\nproperly state a claim for trade dress infringement. We\ntherefore affirm the District Court’s dismissal of the claim. 3\n\n2\n The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1367(a).

Thomas McCarthy,\nMcCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 8:3 (4th\ned. 2014) (“[T]he discrete elements which make up the [trade\ndress claim] should be separated out and identified in a\nlist.”). 4 This allows the district court to ensure that the claim\n\n4\n  For example, in Rose Art Industries, the plaintiff claimed\nthat the following elements comprised its trade dress:\n\n       (1) a prominent band that is either straight or\n       wavy and often black in color that cuts across\n       the middle of the front of the package,\n       extending to the sides with the words\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fis not “pitched at an improper level of generality, i.e., the\nclaimant [does not] seek[] protection for an unprotectable\nstyle, theme or idea.” Landscape Forms, 113 F.3d at 381.\nEven before it reaches the question of protectability, however,\na district court should scrutinize a plaintiff’s description of its\ntrade dress to ensure itself that the plaintiff seeks protection\n\n\n       “CRAYONS” or “WASHABLE MARKERS”\n       or other descriptive term in white letters\n       imprinted on the band (the “Band and Letter\n       feature”); (2) a yellow background on the top of\n       the package with a contrasting background\n       color (either red, purple, pink, or a combination\n       of purple fading to red) on the bottom of the\n       package; and (3) a prominent display of the\n       Rose Art logo in golden yellow (either foil or\n       print) or red, either with or without a rainbow\n       “swish” design behind the logo on the front of\n       the package. In addition, in its presentation to\n       the District Court, Rose Art included three other\n       elements in its claim of infringement: (1) the\n       statement “since 1923”; (2) the statement on the\n       front of the package that the product is\n       “Certified Non–Toxic;” and (3) the sentence\n       inviting consumer comments, “Rose Art invites\n       your comments and questions about this\n       product.

Eagle\nOutfitters, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776545\"><a href=\"/opinion/776545/abercrombie-fitch-stores-inc-v-american-eagle-outfitters-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 630 (6th Cir. 2002). However,\nthe “thing” must “dress[] a good.” Id. That is, the alleged\ntrade dress must create some visual impression on consumers.\nOtherwise, there is simply no “dress” to protect.\n\n       According to Fair Wind, its trade dress is “the\ncombination of its choice to solely employ catamaran\nvessels” and its “unique teaching curriculum, student\ntestimonials, and registered domain name,” which “all\ncombine to identify Fair Wind’s uniquely configured business\nto the general public.” Appellant’s Br. at 20-21. 5 By its own\nterms, then, Fair Wind’s “trade dress” is simply a hodgepodge\nof unconnected pieces of its business, which together do not\ncomprise any sort of composite visual effect. Fair Wind is\nnot arguing that VISS stole Fair Wind’s “look” in order to\nlure away customers. In fact, several of the elements of Fair\n\n5\n   Although Fair Wind asserts in its briefs on appeal that\nVISS’s domain name is nearly identical to Fair Wind’s, the\ncomplaint makes no such allegation, nor can one reasonably\ninfer such an allegation. While the complaint mentions\nVISS’s domain name, see First Am. Compl. ¶ 5, it never\ndiscusses Fair Wind’s web address. Because we cannot\nconsider allegations outside the complaint, the similarity in\nthe parties’ domain names cannot play a part in our analysis.\nIn any event, the fact that the parties have similar web\naddresses, even if properly pleaded, does not alter our\nconclusion that Fair Wind has failed to allege a cognizable\ntrade dress.\n\n\n\n\n                             12\n\fWind’s trade dress—such as the teaching curriculum—are not\nclearly visual aspects of the business at all. 6 Rather, Fair\nWind asserts that Defendants have harmed Fair Wind “by\ncopying every material element of Fair Wind’s business and\npresenting [it to] the public.” Id. at 15. This claim has little\nto do with trade dress.\n\n       Perhaps realizing its failure to plead a cognizable trade\ndress, Fair Wind pivoted at oral argument, placing its “web\ndesign” at the center of the trade dress claim. But the\ncomplaint does not enumerate what specific elements of its\nwebsite comprise a distinctive trade dress or that its site has\nany distinctive ornamental features. Cf. Xuan-Thao N.\nNguyen, Should It Be a Free for All? The Challenge of\nExtending Trade Dress Protection to the Look and Feel of\nWeb Sites in the Evolving Internet, 49 Am. U. L. Rev. 1233,\n1236, 1240 (2000) (arguing that a combination of a website’s\n“color, graphics, animations, designs, layout, [and] text” may\nqualify for trade dress protection).\n\n       Indeed, Fair Wind has failed to allege any facts at all\nrelating to the substance of its own website. True, the\n\n6\n We do not suggest that the curriculum of a sailing school, if\npart of, for example, an overall look of a schoolhouse or a\nwebsite, could not be part of a business’s trade dress.

Others, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492734\"><a href=\"/opinion/492734/fuddruckers-inc-and-freddie-fuddruckers-franchising-inc-a-texas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n841 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that a menu, in combination with\nother aspects of a restaurant’s decor, can constitute\nprotectable trade dress). But the complaint does not in any\nway indicate that Fair Wind’s curriculum creates any kind of\nvisual impression. It is not even clear from the complaint that\nFair Wind’s curriculum is something that can be seen.\n\n\n\n\n                              13\n\fcomplaint suggests that VISS’s website contains a picture of a\nFair Wind catamaran, as well as student feedback\nmechanisms, curriculum, and itineraries identical to those\nused by Fair Wind. First. Am. Compl. ¶ 29. But the fact that\nVISS has copied aspects of Fair Wind’s business and placed\nthem on its website says nothing about the content of Fair\nWind’s website, let alone whether Fair Wind’s website has a\ncomposite look that might constitute a trade dress.\n\n      Because Fair Wind has failed to give Defendants\nadequate notice of what overall look it wishes to protect, its\ntrade dress claim cannot survive Defendants’ motion to\ndismiss. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n\n        But even assuming that Fair Wind had adequately\nstated the overall design it seeks to protect, its alleged “trade\ndress” is clearly functional, and therefore not protectable. A\nfunctional feature is one that is “essential to the use or\npurpose of the article,” “affects the cost or quality of the\narticle,” or one that, if kept from competitors, would put them\nat a “significant non-reputation-related disadvantage.”\nTrafFix, 532 U.S. at 33.            By contrast, a feature is\nnonfunctional where it “is unrelated to the consumer demand\n. . . and serves merely to identify the source of the product”\nor business. Prufrock Ltd., Inc. v. Lasater, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463270\"><a href=\"/opinion/463270/prufrock-ltd-inc-v-dan-lasater-allan-roberts-garland-streett-dixie/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133\n(8th Cir. 1986). Student feedback procedures, catamarans,\nteaching itineraries, and curriculum all affect the quality of\nFair Wind’s business. They play a critical role in the\nconsumer demand for Fair Wind’s services, rather than\nmerely identifying Fair Wind as the source of the sailing\ninstruction. Cf. TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 32 (holding that the\ndual-spring design was not protectable because it had a\npurpose “beyond serving the purpose of informing consumers\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fthat the sign stands are made by” the plaintiff). Thus, Fair\nWind’s alleged dress is plainly functional.\n\n       Rather than argue that the particular features of its\n“trade dress” are nonfunctional, Fair Wind argues that the\nvarious functional aspects of its business combine to create\nsomething nonfunctional. Fair Wind’s argument rests on\nClicks Billiards, Inc. v. Sixshooters, Inc., where the Ninth\nCircuit concluded that the sum of particular functional\nelements in a pool hall, such as its counters and lighting,\ncould amount to a nonfunctional look.

The Clicks court explained, “[t]he\nfact that individual elements of the trade dress may be\nfunctional does not necessarily mean that the trade dress as a\nwhole is functional; rather, functional elements that are\nseparately unprotectable can be protected together as part of\ntrade dress.” Id. at 1259 (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also id. at 1261 (“To be sure, many of these elements,\nconsidered in isolation, may be functional. The issue,\nhowever, is whether, taken as a whole, the overall look and\nfeel of the establishment is functional.”). The plaintiff in\nClicks offered evidence that its “composite tapestry of visual\neffects” had become associated with its pool halls and not\nothers. See id. at 1259, 1261-62. Thus, the Ninth Circuit\nconcluded that the plaintiff’s trade dress claim should survive\nsummary judgment.\n\n       In stark contrast to the plaintiff in Clicks, Fair Wind\nhas not explained how the identified functional elements\nachieve a nonfunctional “composite tapestry of visual\neffects.” Id. at 1259. Fair Wind has not suggested, in its\ncomplaint or elsewhere, that its business has a distinctive\nappearance at all. Clicks is therefore inapposite.\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\f       In sum, Fair Wind has failed to allege a cognizable\ntrade dress. Moreover, to the extent that the complaint\nalleges that Fair Wind’s boats, curriculum, itineraries, and\nstudent feedback procedures are its trade dress, that trade\ndress is functional, and therefore not protectable. Fair Wind’s\nclaim does not hold water.\n\n                             III.\n\n        Fair Wind next argues that the District Court\nimproperly dismissed its unjust enrichment claim by\nemploying too exacting a pleading standard. Specifically, the\nDistrict Court concluded that Fair Wind had failed to properly\nplead that Defendants had been enriched by their conduct.\nWe agree with the District Court that Fair Wind has failed to\nstate a claim for unjust enrichment. We therefore affirm.\n\n       To recover for unjust enrichment under Virgin Islands\nlaw, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant was\nenriched, (2) the enrichment was at the plaintiff’s expense,\nand (3) the circumstances were such that, in equity and good\nconscience, the defendant should return the money or\nproperty to the plaintiff. Martin v. Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">V.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393-\n94 (V.I. 2010).        To state the obvious, a defendant’s\nenrichment is critical to the success of an unjust enrichment\nclaim. See Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust\nEnrichment § 1 cmt. d. (“Restitution is concerned with the\nreceipt of benefits that yield a measurable increase in the\nrecipient’s wealth.”).\n\n       The premise of Fair Wind’s unjust enrichment claim is\nthat Defendants gained, and Fair Wind lost, by Defendants\n“trading on Fair Wind’s trade dress, proprietary information\n\n\n\n\n                              16\n\fand trade secrets.” First Am. Compl. ¶ 50. As the District\nCourt noted, however, the complaint contains no facts\nconcerning in what respect Defendants were enriched, other\nthan the conclusory assertion that “Dempster and VISS have\nbeen enriched by their improper and unjustified conduct.” Id.\nat ¶ 48.\n\n        At the pleadings stage, it is often not possible for a\nplaintiff to recount with specificity to what extent a defendant\nwas enriched by her misconduct. That is what discovery is\nfor. At the same time, however, Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure requires a plaintiff to plead some\nfactual allegations in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\nSee Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557; Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.\nPleading the “mere elements” of a cause of action will not do.\nPhillips, 515 F.3d at 233. Here, Fair Wind has failed to even\nallege that Defendants’ business accrued additional profits by\npoaching Fair Wind’s proprietary information and trade\nsecrets. That may have satisfied Rule 8(a)(2)’s fairly lenient\nnotice-pleading standard. See id. at 234. But the bald\nassertion that Defendants “have been enriched” does not.\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the District Court’s dismissal\nof Fair Wind’s unjust enrichment claim.\n\n                              IV.\n\n       We next address the District Court’s award of\nattorneys’ fees to the Defendants in the amount of $36,347. 7\n\n7\n  “We exercise plenary review over legal issues relating to the\nappropriate standard under which to evaluate an application\nfor attorneys’ fees. . . .

Id. They nonetheless insist that “the District\nCourt correctly chose to award Defendants . . . fees solely\nunder Section [541] . . . as the attorneys’ fees expended in\ndefending all three of [Fair Wind’s] causes of action were\ninextricably intertwined.” Appellees’ Supplemental Br. at 9.\nDefendants “cit[e] . . . defense counsel’s timesheets” as\nevidence that “the fees incurred defending against Plaintiff’s\nclaims for trade dress infringement, tortious interference with\ncontract and unjust enrichment were ‘inextricably\nintertwined.’” Id. at 23.\n\n        We have never approved of section 541 fees where the\nterritorial and federal claims are “inextricably intertwined.”\nAcknowledging that we have not endorsed this argument,\nDefendants rely on a Ninth Circuit opinion, Gracie v. Gracie,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769338\"><a href=\"/opinion/769338/carley-gracie-an-individual-gracie-usa-a-california-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2000), for their proposed exception to\nthe Figueroa rule. There, the Ninth Circuit held that “a party\ncannot recover legal fees incurred in litigating non-Lanham\nAct claims unless the Lanham Act claims and non-Lanham\nAct claims are so intertwined that it is impossible to\ndifferentiate between work done on claims.” Id. at 1069\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Despite Defendants’ insistence that the fees incurred\ndefending the territorial law and federal law claims cannot be\nsegregated, the District Court made no such finding. Unless\nand until it does, we see no reason to decide when, if ever, the\n“inextricably intertwined” exception to the Figueroa rule\nmight apply. See Gracie, 217 F.3d at 1070 (“[T]he\nimpossibility of making an exact apportionment does not\nrelieve the district court of its duty to make some attempt to\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fadjust the fee award         in    an   effort   to   reflect   an\napportionment.”).\n\n       Moreover, we remain unconvinced that where federal\nand territorial claims are “inextricably intertwined,” it\nnecessarily makes sense to award fees to the prevailing party\nfor the entirety of the litigation under section 541. The rule\nproposed by Defendants, it seems to us, would encourage\nparties to obfuscate time entries. Indeed, the fact that\nDefendants cite their own time entries as evidence that the\nclaims were inextricably intertwined lends credence to that\nconcern.     Moreover, Defendants’ proposed rule seems\nparticularly inequitable in a case, such as this one, where the\nmajority of the parties’ energy was spent litigating the federal\nclaim, not the territorial claims.\n\n       In sum, the District Court should have attempted to\napportion the fees incurred defending the territorial and\nfederal claims.\n\n                              B.\n\n       Once the time spent on the federal and territorial\nclaims is apportioned, the question remains whether\nDefendants may recover fees spent defending the federal\nclaim at all. As it happens, Fair Wind’s sole federal claim\nwas brought under the Lanham Act, § 35(a) of which permits\nthe recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees only “in\nexceptional cases.” 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a). Defendants argue\nthat this case meets the standard for exceptionality, and that\nthey are therefore entitled to reasonable fees expended on the\nentirety of the litigation.\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\f        As we have explained elsewhere, “Congress added the\nattorney’s fee provision of § 35(a) to the Lanham Act in 1975\nin response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Fleischmann\nDistilling Corp. v.

Moreover, the\n       culpable conduct may relate not only to the\n       circumstances of the Lanham Act violation, but\n       also to the way the losing party handled himself\n       during the litigation.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014), analyzing when a district court\nmay award fees under § 285 of the Patent Act. Like § 35(a)\nof the Lanham Act, § 285 provides that “[t]he court in\nexceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the\nprevailing party.” 35 U.S.C. § 285.\n\n        Prior to Octane Fitness, the Federal Circuit took the\nposition that “a case is ‘exceptional’ only if a district court\neither finds litigation-related misconduct of an independently\nsanctionable magnitude or determines that the litigation was\nboth ‘brought in subjective bad faith’ and ‘objectively\nbaseless.’” Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 1756 (quoting\nBrooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788814\"><a href=\"/opinion/788814/brooks-furniture-manufacturing-inc-v-dutailier-international-inc-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2005)). The Octane Fitness Court\nrejected this standard, embracing a definition of “exceptional”\nfar more expansive than the one articulated by the Federal\nCircuit in Brooks. Looking to the plain meaning of the term,\nthe Court explained that “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one\nthat stands out from others with respect to the substantive\nstrength of a party’s litigating position (considering both the\ngoverning law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable\nmanner in which the case was litigated.” Id. at 1756. Thus, it\nis within a court’s discretion to find a case “exceptional”\nbased upon “the governing law and the facts of the case,”\n\n\n\n\n                              22\n\firrespective of whether the losing party is culpable. For\nexample, “a case presenting . . . exceptionally meritless\nclaims may sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to\nwarrant a fee award.” Id. at 1757. This is so even if the\nlosing party’s conduct did not suggest “bad faith, fraud,\nmalice, [or] knowing infringement.” Green, 486 F.3d at 103.\n\n        While Octane Fitness directly concerns the scope of a\ndistrict court’s discretion to award fees for “exceptional” case\nunder § 285 of the Patent Act, the case controls our\ninterpretation of § 35(a) of the Lanham Act. Not only is §\n285 identical to § 35(a), but Congress referenced § 285 in\npassing § 35(a). See S. Rep. No. 93–1400, at 2 (1974),\nreprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7132, 7133; see also\nSecuracomm Consulting, 224 F.3d at 281. Thus, we have\n“look[ed] to the interpretation of the patent statute for\nguidance” in interpreting § 35(a). Id. Moreover, in its\nexplication of the word “exceptional,” the Octane Fitness\nCourt relied in part on the D.C. Circuit’s holding that the term\n“exceptional,” as used in § 35(a) of the Lanham Act, means\n“uncommon” or “not run-of-the-mill.” Octane Fitness, 134\nS. Ct. at 1756 (quoting Noxell Corp. v. Firehouse No. 1 Bar-\nB-Que Rest., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457684\"><a href=\"/opinion/457684/noxell-corporation-v-firehouse-no-1-bar-b-que-restaurant-dba-san/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). In so\ndoing, the Octane Fitness Court noted that the Lanham Act\nfee provision is “identical” to § 285 of the Patent Act. Id. We\nbelieve that the Court was sending a clear message that it was\ndefining “exceptional” not just for the fee provision in the\nPatent Act, but for the fee provision in the Lanham Act as\nwell.\n\n      We therefore import Octane Fitness’s definition of\n“exceptionality” into our interpretation of § 35(a) of the\nLanham Act. Under Octane Fitness, a district court may find\n\n\n\n\n                              23\n\fa case “exceptional,” and therefore award fees to the\nprevailing party, when (a) there is an unusual discrepancy in\nthe merits of the positions taken by the parties or (b) the\nlosing party has litigated the case in an “unreasonable\nmanner.” Id.; cf. Green, 486 F.3d at 103 (noting that a district\ncourt may award fees as a result of either the circumstances of\nthe Lanham Act violation or the way in which the losing party\nlitigated the claim). Whether litigation positions or litigation\ntactics are “exceptional” enough to merit attorneys’ fees must\nbe determined by district courts “in the case-by-case exercise\nof their discretion, considering the totality of the\ncircumstances.”      Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 1756.\nImportantly, that discretion is not cabined by a threshold\nrequirement that the losing party acted culpably. The losing\nparty’s blameworthiness may well play a role in a district\ncourt’s analysis of the “exceptionality” of a case, but Octane\nFitness has eliminated the first step in our two-step test for\nawarding fees under § 35(a) of the Lanham Act.\n\n         The parties ask us to decide whether this case merits\nattorneys’ fees under § 35(a) of the Lanham Act. We decline\nto do so. With its unparalleled knowledge of the litigation\nand the parties, the District Court is better suited to make that\nassessment in the first instance. See Securacomm Consulting,\n224 F.3d at 279. We therefore remand to the District Court,\nso that it may determine whether fees are appropriate under\nthis slightly altered standard for awarding fees in Lanham Act\ncases. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>\n                                <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"page\">8</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n We similarly decline to reach the “reasonableness” of the\nDistrict Court’s fee award.\n\n\n\n\n                               24\n\f         We affirm the District Court’s dismissal of Fair\nWind’s trade dress and unjust enrichment claims.
