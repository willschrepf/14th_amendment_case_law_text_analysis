The plaintiff is a\n\nmunicipal waterworks; the defendants are upstream drainage districts\n\nand their trustees.    The plaintiff provides drinking water to central\n\nIowans and is suing for money damages and other remedies to recover its\n\ncosts to remove nitrates from Raccoon River water.            The case was\n\nbrought in federal court.    Our role is simply to answer the following\n\nquestions of Iowa law certified by that court.\n\n      Question 1: As a matter of Iowa law, does the doctrine of implied\n\nimmunity of drainage districts as applied in cases such as Fisher v.\n\nDallas County, 369 N.W.2d 426 (Iowa 1985), grant drainage districts\n\nunqualified immunity from all of the damage claims set forth in the\n\ncomplaint (docket no. 2)?\n\n      Answer: Yes. As explained below, drainage districts have a\n\nlimited, targeted role—to facilitate the drainage of farmland in order to\n\nmake it more productive. Accordingly, Iowa law has immunized drainage\n\ndistricts from damages claims for over a century.       This immunity was\n\nreaffirmed unanimously by our court just over four years ago.\n\n      Question 2: As a matter of Iowa law, does the doctrine of implied\n\nimmunity grant drainage districts unqualified immunity from equitable\n\nremedies and claims other than mandamus?\n\n      Answer: Yes. Again, Iowa precedent, reaffirmed unanimously by\n\nour court just four years ago, recognizes that drainage districts are\n\nimmune from injunctive relief claims other than mandamus.\n\n      Question 3: As a matter of Iowa law, can the plaintiff assert\n\nprotections afforded by the Iowa Constitution’s inalienable rights, due\n\f                                           4\n\nprocess, equal protection, and takings clauses against drainage districts\n\nas alleged in the complaint?\n\n       Answer: No. Although            these      constitutional       clauses       are\n\nfundamental to our freedom in Iowa, they exist to protect citizens against\n\noverreaching      government.          Generally,     one    subdivision      of   state\n\ngovernment cannot sue another subdivision of state government under\n\nthese clauses. And even if they could, an increased need to treat nitrates\n\ndrawn from river water to meet standards for kitchen tap water would\n\nnot amount to a constitutional violation.\n\n       Question 4: As a matter of Iowa law, does the plaintiff have a\n\nproperty interest that may be the subject of a claim under the Iowa\n\nConstitution’s takings clause as alleged in the complaint?\n\n       Answer: No,      for   the    reasons     discussed     in   the    answer     to\n\nQuestion 3.\n\n       In the balance of this opinion, we will explain our reasoning behind\n\nthese answers. We emphasize that our decision does not relate to other\n\nmatters raised in the federal court litigation, including claims brought\n\nunder federal law.\n\n       I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n       To provide context for the certified questions, we adopt this\n\ndiscussion from the federal court’s certification order.                  See Foley v.\n\nArgosy Gaming Co., 688 N.W.2d 244, 246 (Iowa 2004) (“We restrict our\n\ndiscussion to the facts provided with the certified questions.”). 1\n\n       A. The Des Moines Water Works. Plaintiff, the Board of Water\n\nWorks Trustees of the City of Des Moines, Iowa, also known as the\n\n       1We  reiterate the certifying court’s disclaimer that no judicial fact-finding has\noccurred. The factual background is drawn from allegations of the pleadings that were\nadmitted or denied for lack of information.\n\f                                                5\n\nDes Moines Water Works (DMWW), is a municipal water utility under\n\nIowa Code chapter 388 (2015) 2 that provides drinking water to an\n\nestimated half-million Iowans in the Des Moines area, both by direct\n\nservice and wholesale service to other utilities and districts.                      DMWW\n\nobtains its water primarily from the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\n\nThe Raccoon River drains about 2.3 million acres from portions of\n\nseventeen Iowa counties, including Buena Vista, Sac, and Calhoun. It\n\nflows approximately 186 miles from its origin in Buena Vista County to\n\nits confluence          with   the    Des      Moines   River, south         of    downtown\n\nDes Moines.\n\n        Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) as amended in 1996,\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 300f–300j (2012), DMWW is obligated to meet the maximum\n\ncontaminant level standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency\n\n(EPA) in the water it serves to consumers. The SDWA is the key federal\n\nlaw for protecting public water supplies from harmful contaminants.\n\nSection 300g–1, as amended in 1996, directs the EPA to select\n\ncontaminants for regulatory consideration based on occurrence, health\n\neffects, and meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 300g–1(b).        For each contaminant that the EPA determines requires\n\nregulation, the EPA must set a nonenforceable maximum contaminant\n\nlevel goal at a level that avoids known or anticipated adverse health\n\neffects and that allows an adequate margin of safety.                             Id. § 300g–\n\n1(b)(4)(A). The EPA must then set an enforceable standard, a maximum\n\ncontaminant level (MCL), as close to the goal as is feasible, using the best\n\ntechnology, treatment techniques, or other means available and taking\n\ncosts    into      consideration.        Id.    § 300g–1(b)(4)(B).      The        maximum\n\n        2All   references are to the 2015 Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\f                                   6\n\ncontaminant level for nitrate, promulgated in 2012 and currently in\n\nforce, is 10 mg/L, close to the equivalent of ten parts per million. See\n\nEPA,     Table   of   Regulated     Drinking     Water    Contaminants,\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/table-regulated-\n\ndrinking-water-contaminants (last visited Jan. 12, 2017).    Nitrate is a\n\nsoluble ion of nitrogen, found in soil, which only leaves the soil when\n\ndrawn out by the flow of water. See id. The health risks associated with\n\nnitrate contamination in drinking water include blue baby syndrome and\n\npotential endocrine disruption impacts. Id.\n\n       In its complaint filed in federal court, DMWW states that from\n\n1995 to 2014, nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon River at the DMWW\n\nintake points exceeded the 10 mg/L standard for drinking water at least\n\n1636 days, or twenty-four percent of the time. In 2013 and 2014, the\n\naverage nitrate concentration in the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers was\n\n11.98 mg/L, the third highest average in the last forty years. Similarly,\n\nin September, October, November, and December 2014, the average\n\nnitrate concentration was 11.89 mg/L, 13.23 mg/L, 13.43 mg/L, and\n\n12.56 mg/L, respectively.\n\n       DMWW states that it utilizes three water treatment plants to\n\nprocess source water into drinking water. These three treatment plants,\n\nthe McMullen Plant, the Saylorville Plant, and the Fleur Plant, all draw\n\nwater from the Raccoon River. DMWW has managed excess nitrates in\n\nthe source water it processes in several ways.    At the Fleur Plant, a\n\nfraction of the water undergoes an ion exchange process to remove\n\nnitrates and then is blended with filtered water to stay below the EPA’s\n\n10 mg/L standard. In addition to drawing water from the Raccoon River,\n\nthe McMullen Plant draws water from Crystal Lake, a river-influenced\n\nsurface water source managed to provide reduced-nitrogen water\n\f                                          7\n\nthrough natural biologic processes.           DMWW also can blend the water\n\nfrom the McMullen Plant with nitrate-free water drawn from a reservoir\n\nused as an emergency backup water source. The Saylorville Plant is the\n\nonly plant operated by DMWW that has a limited capacity to remove\n\nnitrates.\n\n       Additionally, DMWW has an ion exchange nitrate-removal facility\n\nthat it operates as needed at a cost of approximately $4000–$7000 per\n\nday. 3 DMWW utilized its nitrate removal continuously due to excessive\n\nnitrate levels until March 10, 2015. The continuous operation for a total\n\nof ninety-six days is the longest in the history of the facility’s operation\n\nduring the winter season. DMWW states that, due to the age and limited\n\ncapacity of the existing nitrate-removal facility, it will need to design and\n\nconstruct a new nitrate-removal facility with a fifty-million-gallon-per-day\n\ncapacity at a cost of between $76 million and $183.5 million before 2020.\n\nOperation and maintenance costs will be in addition to the initial\n\nestimated capital cost.\n\n       B. The Drainage Districts. Drainage districts were instituted in\n\nIowa to allow wetlands to be turned into productive farmland.                    The\n\npurpose of drainage districts in Iowa can be traced back to the late\n\n1800s and early 1900s. See Swamp Land Act of 1850, ch. 84, 9 Stat.\n\n519 (codified at 43 U.S.C. §§ 982–984 (2012)); Hatch, Holbrook & Co. v.\n\nPottawattamie County, 43 Iowa 442 (1876); Iowa Const. art. I, § 18 (as\n\namended in 1908). Vast areas of flatland could not be farmed due to\n\ninadequate drainage.        Iowa Code chapter 468 and Iowa Constitution\n\n\n       3It is unclear from DMWW’s filings whether this nitrate-removal facility is\nlocated at one of its water treatment plants or treats water received from all plants.\nDMWW indicates that its nitrate-removal facility removes nitrates from its finished\nwater.\n\f                                     8\n\narticle I, section 18 govern drainage districts. Drainage districts enable\n\nproperty owners to jointly fund drainage improvements. See Fisher, 369\n\nN.W.2d at 428–29.\n\n            The right of a landowner to place tiles in swales or\n      ditches to carry the water from ponds upon and onto lower\n      lands . . . is necessary . . . in order that low and swampy\n      lands may be reclaimed, and a denial thereof would be\n      productive of incalculable mischief.\n\nDorr v. Simmerson, 127 Iowa 551, 553, 103 N.W. 806, 807 (1905). To\n\nestablish a drainage district, at least two landowners must petition for its\n\ncreation. Iowa Code § 468.6. The affairs of the drainage district are then\n\nmanaged by the county board of supervisors in a representative capacity.\n\nSee, e.g., id. §§ 468.37, .89, .231, .232, .617. The board determines what\n\nimprovements are needed.       Id. § 468.126(1)(a).   If the cost exceeds\n\n$50,000, a hearing is required to determine advisability of expenditure,\n\nand an appeal is allowed. Id. § 468.126(1)(c). Improvements exceeding a\n\ncertain amount can be stopped by a majority of landowners in the\n\ndistrict through a process called remonstrance. Id. § 468.126(4)(c).\n\n      Drainage districts “have only such         [limited] power    as the\n\nlegislature grants them.” Reed v. Muscatine Louisa Drainage Dist. #13,\n\n263 N.W.2d 548, 551 (Iowa 1978). Iowa’s legislature concluded drainage\n\nfrom agricultural and other lands shall be presumed to benefit the\n\npublic:\n\n            1. The drainage of surface waters from agricultural\n      lands and all other lands, including state-owned lakes and\n      wetlands, or the protection of such lands from overflow shall\n      be presumed to be a public benefit and conducive to the\n      public health, convenience, and welfare.\n            2. The provisions of this subchapter and all other laws\n      for the drainage and protection from overflow of agricultural\n      or overflow lands shall be liberally construed to promote\n      leveeing, ditching, draining and reclamation of wet, swampy,\n      and overflow lands.\n\f                                      9\n\nIowa Code § 468.2(1)–(2).\n\n      The thirteen defendant drainage districts in this case are located in\n\nthe North Raccoon watershed and the Des Moines Lobe geographic\n\nformation.   The primary purpose of their drainage infrastructure is to\n\nremove water from agricultural lands.       Private subsurface tiles convey\n\nwater to other subsurface tiles, pipe, subsurface ditches, and channels\n\ncreated and maintained by the defendants, which in turn convey water to\n\nstreams and rivers, and ultimately the Raccoon River.\n\n      C. Procedural Background.           The defendants filed motions for\n\nsummary      judgment    seeking   dismissal   of   DMWW’s    federal     court\n\ncomplaint on several grounds, including the immunities enjoyed by\n\ndrainage districts under Iowa law. After the summary judgment motions\n\nwere briefed and argued, the federal court instructed the parties to meet,\n\nconfer, and come to an agreement on the identification and description of\n\nstate law issues that could be certified to the Iowa Supreme Court and\n\nalso instructed the parties to explain whether they believed these issues\n\nshould be certified.    The parties filed a joint certification report.    The\n\nparties agreed on the wording of the four questions, but disagreed as to\n\nwhether the questions should be certified.            The DMWW favored\n\ncertification. The defendants argued against certification as unnecessary\n\nbecause controlling precedent answered the questions.\n\n      D. The DMWW’s Claims. DMWW’s complaint alleges ten causes\n\nof action: Count I for violation of various federal statutes known as the\n\nClean Water Act; Count II for violation of Iowa Code section 455B.186 (“A\n\npollutant shall not be disposed of by dumping, depositing, or discharging\n\nsuch pollutant into any water of the state . . . .”); Count III for public\n\nnuisance; Count IV for statutory nuisance; Count V for private nuisance;\n\nCount VI for trespass; Count VII for negligence; Count VIII for taking\n\f                                    10\n\nwithout just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the\n\nUnited States Constitution as made applicable by the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment and article I, section 18 of the Iowa Constitution; Count IX\n\nfor violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the due\n\nprocess and equal protection clauses of the Iowa Constitution; and\n\nCount X for permanent, prospective injunctive relief.\n\n        DMWW essentially argues that the defendants are responsible for\n\nthe increased nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon River.          DMWW\n\nalleges it may be forced to construct a new, high-capacity nitrate-removal\n\nfacility, to comply with the SDWA.           DMWW’s state and federal\n\nconstitutional liability theories are based on its claim that the drainage\n\ndistricts are responsible for the increased level of nitrates in the source\n\nwater the DMWW must process.\n\n        Against this backdrop, we turn to the certified questions,\n\nbeginning with the threshold issue of whether we should elect to answer\n\nthem.\n\n        II. Our Discretion to Answer Certified Questions.\n\n        The DMWW and the certifying federal court urge us to answer the\n\nfour certified questions. The drainage districts, however, argue that we\n\nshould decline to answer the questions on grounds that controlling\n\nprecedent is determinative. “Iowa Code section 684A.1 allows this court\n\nto answer questions of Iowa law certified to us by a federal court that\n\nconcludes controlling precedent is lacking when the answer may be\n\ndeterminative of the federal proceeding.” Oyens Feed & Supply, Inc. v.\n\nPrimebank, 808 N.W.2d 186, 188 (Iowa 2011). In Foley, we noted our\n\ndiscretion to answer certified questions that (1) were certified by a proper\n\ncourt, (2) presented questions of Iowa law, (3) “may be determinative of\n\f                                    11\n\nthe cause . . . pending in the certifying court,” and (4) appeared to the\n\ncertifying court to have no controlling Iowa precedent.     688 N.W.2d at\n\n246 (quoting Iowa Code § 684A.1 (2003)).\n\n       The first three requirements are easily met here: the federal court\n\ncertified four questions of Iowa law that, if resolved adversely to DMWW,\n\nwould result in summary judgment dismissing its state law claims. “We\n\ndo not have a situation where the answers to the questions are fact-\n\ndependent or the facts are in conflict. These are pure questions of law.”\n\nIowa Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Tooker, 808 N.W.2d 417, 427 (Iowa\n\n2011) (citations omitted) (distinguishing cases declining to answer\n\ncertified questions that required resolution of factual disputes). It is the\n\nfourth requirement that gives us pause because, as the certifying court\n\nrecognized, we have controlling precedent that resolves the questions in\n\nfavor of the drainage districts, assuming that precedent remains good\n\nlaw.\n\n       The federal court candidly acknowledged in its certification order\n\nthat if it did not certify the questions, it “would have to reject the\n\nthoughtful, creative, novel, and well-argued positions of DMWW as\n\nunsupported by Iowa law.” The court concluded that, given the public\n\nimportance of the case it described as “one of first impression,”\n\ncertification was appropriate to enable our court to decide the questions\n\nunder our state law.\n\n       We addressed the quandary of whether to answer certified\n\nquestions despite controlling precedent in Foley, in which the first\n\ncertified question asked, “Does the requirement of ‘special injury’ to state\n\na claim for a malicious prosecution action still remain the law of Iowa?”\n\n688 N.W.2d at 246 (emphasis added).        John Foley claimed the Argosy\n\ncasino had wrongfully sued him in Illinois for making false statements.\n\f                                    12\n\nId. at 245. Argosy voluntarily dismissed its Illinois lawsuit against Foley\n\nbefore trial. Id. Foley then sued Argosy in Iowa district court, alleging\n\nthat “as a result of the Illinois suit, [his] insurance carrier declined to\n\nrenew its policies and [he] lost financing on a real estate deal in\n\nSioux City.” Id. at 245–46. Foley also claimed the lawsuit “caused him\n\nstress, exacerbating preexisting neck and back pain.”         Id.   Argosy\n\nremoved the action to federal court and moved for summary judgment on\n\ngrounds that Foley failed to allege a recognized type of “special injury,”\n\nsuch as an arrest or seizure of property, required to recover under Iowa\n\nlaw. Id. at 246. The federal court certified four questions to our court\n\nasking whether the harm alleged by Foley was recoverable under Iowa\n\nlaw.   Id.   We observed that we first recognized the special injury\n\nrequirement in 1884 and had reaffirmed it in numerous decisions\n\nthereafter, most recently four years earlier. Id. at 246–47. Yet we noted\n\nFoley invited us to abandon the special-injury requirement. Id. at 247.\n\nWe proceeded to answer the certified questions, stating, “[O]ne may\n\nalways question whether a precedent is controlling by asking whether it\n\nremains the law; it is manifest that we are free to overrule precedents\n\nwhen circumstances warrant.”        Id. at 247.    We then applied our\n\nprecedent to answer the certified questions. Id. at 247–49.\n\n       As in Foley, the questions certified in this case can be answered by\n\napplying long-standing precedent first decided a century ago and\n\nreaffirmed repeatedly and as recently as four years ago.      We take the\n\nsame approach today as we did in Foley. The certifying court here, in its\n\nwisdom, defers to our judgment on whether the DMWW states a claim\n\nagainst the drainage districts under Iowa law. Revisiting our state law\n\nprecedent is our prerogative. See State v. Eichler, 248 Iowa 1267, 1270,\n\n83 N.W.2d 576, 578 (1957) (“If our previous holdings are to be overruled,\n\f                                   13\n\nwe should ordinarily prefer to do it ourselves.”). We elect to answer the\n\ncertified questions.\n\n      III. Analysis.\n\n      We begin our analysis by reviewing our well-settled precedent\n\nlimiting judicial relief against drainage districts to mandamus and\n\nrestricting constitutional challenges by public entities. We next explore\n\nour traditional adherence to precedent left intact by the legislature,\n\ntempered by our obligation to overrule decisions that are plainly\n\nerroneous or rendered obsolete by changing circumstances.        We then\n\naddress whether the DMWW’s claims warrant overruling our prior\n\ndecisions that recognize broad immunity for drainage districts and limit\n\nconstitutional challenges by public bodies. We conclude our precedent\n\nremains good law, and we answer the certified questions accordingly.\n\n      A. Our Controlling Precedent. “Our cases have consistently held\n\nthat a drainage district is not susceptible to suit for money damages. It\n\nhas no corporate existence for that purpose.” Chi. Cent. & Pac. R.R. v.\n\nCalhoun Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, 816 N.W.2d 367, 374 (Iowa 2012)\n\n(quoting Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 429). “A drainage district’s immunity is\n\nnot based on the doctrine of sovereign immunity; instead, it flows from\n\nthe fact that a drainage district is an entity with ‘special and limited\n\npowers and duties conferred by the Iowa Constitution.’ ”       Id. at 374\n\n(quoting Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 430).\n\n      Drainage districts are created and governed by statute, Iowa Code\n\nchapter 468, as authorized under the Iowa Constitution, article I, section\n\n18.   Drainage district immunity is premised on their limited purpose,\n\nwhich is “to build and maintain drainage improvements that provide for\n\nthe ‘drainage and improvement of agricultural and other lands, thereby\n\nmaking them tillable or suitable for profitable use.’ ” Hardin Cty.\n\f                                              14\n\nDrainage Dist. 55, Div. 3, Lateral 10 v. Union Pac. R.R., 826 N.W.2d 507,\n\n510 (Iowa 2013) (quoting Chi., Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. v. Mosquito\n\nDrainage Dist., 190 Iowa 162, 163, 180 N.W. 170, 170 (1920)). Drainage\n\ndistricts have no other function, power, or purpose.              As the certifying\n\ncourt observed, “Drainage districts are something of a collective passive\n\nutility system.” The districts have accomplished their original statutory\n\nmission: The terrain in much of north central Iowa was too wet or\n\nswampy for growing row crops 4 until subsurface drain tiles were installed\n\nto “transform these lands into the productive farm land that exists\n\ntoday.”      Id. at 508.        The drainage districts now have a continuing\n\nstatutory duty to keep the drains working, that is, to maintain the\n\noriginal capacity of the drainage systems. See Iowa Code § 468.126(1)(a).\n\n      We reaffirmed our immunity precedent just four years ago to hold\n\nthat a railroad could not sue a drainage district for the railroad’s costs\n\nincurred repairing underground drainage tile. Chi. Cent. & Pac. R.R., 816\n\nN.W.2d at 378. The tile had collapsed, causing a sinkhole undermining\n\nthe railroad tracks.         Id. at 368.       The county board of supervisors, as\n\ntrustees for the drainage district, owed the statutory duty to maintain\n\ndrainage improvements in repair.                     Id. at 373 (citing Iowa Code\n\n§ 468.126(1)). After the county supervisors failed to fix the sinkhole, the\n\nrailroad made repairs to the drainage system at its expense and\n\ndemanded reimbursement.                   Id. at 369.      We held the railroad’s\n\nreimbursement claim failed as a matter of law, stating, “We see no reason\n\nto abandon our previous holdings that . . . mandamus is the proper\n\nremedy.” Id. at 374.\n\n\n\n      4It   is said that “corn doesn’t like wet feet.”\n\f                                    15\n\n      This has been our law for over one hundred years.        See Gish v.\n\nCastner-Williams & Askland Drainage Dist., 136 Iowa 155, 157, 113 N.W.\n\n757, 757 (1907) (“The drainage district is not such [a] legal entity as is\n\nknown to or recognized by law as a proper party to adversary\n\nproceedings.”); Clary v. Woodbury County, 135 Iowa 488, 495, 113 N.W.\n\n330, 332–33 (1907) (holding drainage district could not be sued for\n\ndownstream flooding).    We have repeatedly affirmed the principle that\n\ndrainage districts cannot be sued for money damages. See, e.g., Gard v.\n\nLittle Sioux Intercty. Drainage Dist., 521 N.W.2d 696, 698 (Iowa 1994)\n\n(dismissing tort action against drainage district by estates of drowned\n\nboaters whose watercraft struck obstruction maintained by district); Nat’l\n\nProps. Corp. v. Polk County, 386 N.W.2d 98, 107 (Iowa 1986) (noting\n\n“[o]ur cases have consistently held that a drainage district is not\n\nsusceptible to suit for money damages” (quoting Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at\n\n429)); Miller v. Monona County, 229 Iowa 165, 170, 294 N.W. 308, 310–\n\n11 (1940) (holding operation of drainage district could not be declared a\n\nnuisance); Bd. of Supervisors v. Dist. Ct., 209 Iowa 1030, 1033, 229 N.W.\n\n711, 712 (1930) (“Nor is the plaintiff entitled to a judgment against said\n\ndrainage district No. 46. A drainage district is sui generis. It is not a\n\ncorporation. It cannot sue or be sued. . . . There can be no judgment at\n\nlaw rendered against a drainage district in any case.”); see also Holler v.\n\nBd. of Supervisors, 304 N.W.2d 441, 442 (Iowa Ct. App. 1980) (“[W]e can\n\nfind no authority for the plaintiffs’ contention that injury resulting to a\n\nlower landowner from the exercise of [duties of the drainage district]\n\nshould be compensated . . . .”).\n\n      In Fisher, homeowners whose basement flooded during heavy rains\n\nblamed nearby drainage tile blocked by tree roots and debris.          369\n\nN.W.2d at 427–28. They filed a tort action seeking money damages from\n\f                                    16\n\nthe drainage district and the county board of supervisors, alleging\n\nnegligent inspection and maintenance of the drainage tile line. Id. The\n\ndistrict court ruled that neither the drainage district nor the board acting\n\non its behalf could be sued for money damages. Id. at 428. We affirmed,\n\nnoting the “limited nature of a drainage district’s purposes and powers”\n\nas the reason judicial relief is limited to mandamus actions to compel\n\nperformance of a statutory duty. Id. at 429, 430–31. We reiterated that\n\nwe have never permitted a drainage district to be sued “for money\n\ndamages on a tort theory for injury to land within the district” and\n\nrejected the plaintiffs’ argument that the legislature’s partial abrogation\n\nof sovereign immunity with the enactment of the Municipal Tort Claims\n\nAct, Iowa Code chapter 613A (now codified at Iowa Code chapter 670),\n\nopened the door to tort actions against a drainage district. Id. at 429–30.\n\nWe elaborated,\n\n            We do not agree that a drainage district’s immunity\n      from suit in tort must stand or fall with the doctrine of\n      sovereign immunity. Nothing in our prior cases suggests\n      that sovereign immunity was the reason for denial of the\n      right to sue a drainage district for money damages. The\n      language of the cases indicates that, apart from any question\n      of sovereign immunity, a drainage district is merely an area\n      of land, not an entity subject to a judgment for tort damages.\n             This was never the case with such governmental\n      entities as cities or counties. Even before the enactment of\n      chapter 613A, a city could be sued for torts committed in a\n      proprietary, as opposed to governmental, capacity.         In\n      contrast, a drainage district could not be subject to a money\n      judgment in tort under any state of facts.\n\nId. at 430 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). We expressly held that “a\n\ndrainage district is not a ‘municipality’ within the meaning of Iowa Code\n\nsection 613A.1(1). A drainage district is not subject to suit in tort for\n\nmoney damages.” Id.\n\f                                     17\n\n      A decade later, in Gard, we declined to overrule Fisher and rejected\n\nan equal protection challenge to drainage district immunity. 521 N.W.2d\n\nat 698–99. We affirmed the dismissal of a wrongful-death action arising\n\nfrom a fatal boat accident blamed on an underwater obstruction allegedly\n\nmaintained by the drainage district. Id. at 697, 699. We noted after our\n\ndecision in Fisher, the legislature did not amend the Municipal Tort\n\nClaims Act to include drainage districts within the definition of\n\nmunicipalities subject to tort claims.      Id. at 698.    We “invoked the\n\nprinciple that issues of statutory interpretation settled by the court and\n\nnot disturbed by the legislature have become tacitly accepted by the\n\nlegislature.” Id. Accordingly, we applied the doctrine of stare decisis. Id.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued this resulted in a violation of equal protection under\n\nthe Federal and Iowa Constitutions by creating separate classes of\n\nvictims: (1) persons injured by drainage districts who could not sue; and\n\n(2) persons injured by other local government entities who could sue. Id.\n\nat 698–99.     But we rejected the constitutional challenge, stating,\n\n“Because of the limited nature of a drainage district’s purposes and\n\npowers, there is a rational basis for the classification.” Id. at 699.\n\n      Again in 2012, we reiterated our interpretation of chapter 468\n\nprecluding claims for money damages and limiting judicial relief to\n\nmandamus. Chi. Cent. & Pac. R.R., 816 N.W.2d at 374. “Suits against\n\ndrainage districts ‘have been allowed only to compel, complete, or correct\n\nthe performance of a duty or the exercise of a power by those acting on\n\nbehalf of a drainage district.’ ” Id. at 378 (quoting Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at\n\n429). We saw “no reason to abandon our previous holdings” particularly\n\ngiven the legislature’s inaction, “indicating its tacit acceptance of\n\nmandamus as the appropriate remedy for board inaction.” Id. at 374.\n\nOur decision was unanimous, with one justice not participating.\n\f                                    18\n\n      We have long made clear that mandamus is the proper remedy to\n\nadjudicate claims that a drainage district is violating a duty imposed by\n\nan Iowa statute.   See id.; Voogd v. Joint Drainage Dist. No. 3-11, 188\n\nN.W.2d 387, 391 (Iowa 1971) (“A drain once completed is under the\n\nsupervision of the supervisors, and they can be compelled by mandamus\n\nto maintain and keep it in repair.”); State ex rel. Iowa Emp’t Sec. Comm’n\n\nv. Des Moines County, 260 Iowa 341, 346, 149 N.W.2d 288, 291 (1967)\n\n(holding “[a]n action in mandamus is the proper remedy” to compel\n\ndrainage district to collect and pay state retirement and social security\n\ntaxes owing under Iowa Code chapters 97B and 97C).\n\n      We have specifically held downstream property owners may not\n\nobtain other injunctive relief from drainage districts.   Maben v. Olson,\n\n187 Iowa 1060, 1063–64, 175 N.W. 512, 513–15 (1919) (reversing\n\ninjunction obtained by downstream property owners against drainage\n\ndistrict and holding damages from overflow were not a compensable\n\ntaking).\n\n      Another line of cases holds that political subdivisions, as creatures\n\nof statute, cannot sue to challenge the constitutionality of state statutes.\n\nSee Bd. of Supervisors v. Dep’t of Revenue, 263 N.W.2d 227, 232–34\n\n(Iowa 1978) (“Our cases have uniformly held a county lacks the ability to\n\nmount a constitutional attack upon state legislative enactments.”\n\n(quoting Warren County v. Judges of Fifth Judicial Dist., 243 N.W.2d 894,\n\n897 (Iowa 1976))); Charles Hewitt & Sons Co. v. Keller, 223 Iowa 1372,\n\n1377, 275 N.W. 94, 97 (1937) (“Counties and other municipal\n\ncorporations are, of course, the creatures of the legislature . . . and may\n\nnot question that power which brought it into existence . . . .”); McSurely\n\nv. McGrew, 140 Iowa 163, 170, 118 N.W. 415, 419 (1908) (“[T]he\n\nmunicipality itself cannot complain of any act of the Legislature\n\f                                      19\n\ndiminishing its revenues, amending its charter, or even dissolving it\n\nentirely.”); see also In re A.W., 741 N.W.2d 793, 805 (Iowa 2007) (“The\n\ncounty attorney’s authority to act on behalf of either the county or the\n\nState is derived from the legislature, and he therefore may not challenge\n\nthe constitutionality of legislative acts in court while representing the\n\ninterests of the State.”).\n\n      This reasoning readily extends to a public utility such as the\n\nDMWW, another creature of statute, and precludes its constitutional\n\nchallenges to chapter 468, which we have interpreted to provide broad\n\nimmunity for drainage districts.      See Hous. Auth. of the Kaw Tribe of\n\nIndians of Okla. v. City of Ponca City, 952 F.2d 1183, 1189–90 (10th Cir.\n\n1991) (holding local housing authority could not bring due process or\n\nequal protection challenge against another political subdivision acting\n\nunder state statute); Village of Arlington Heights v. Reg’l Transp. Auth.,\n\n653 F.2d 1149, 1153 (7th Cir. 1981) (“[T]he principle that a municipality\n\nmay not challenge acts of the state under the Fourteenth Amendment\n\napplies ‘whether the defendant is the state itself or another of the state’s\n\npolitical subdivisions.’ ” (quoting City of South Lake Tahoe v. Cal. Tahoe\n\nReg’l Planning Agency, 625 F.2d 231, 233 (9th Cir. 1980))).\n\n      In sum, a century’s worth of precedent, including a case our court\n\ndecided unanimously just four years ago, precludes any remedy against\n\ndrainage districts other than mandamus.        While one can critique the\n\nreasoning of specific decisions, as one can criticize any decision this\n\ncourt has made, the overall body of law supporting this proposition is\n\nquite weighty and long-established.\n\n      B. Stare Decisis. Stare decisis “is a Latin term meaning ‘to stand\n\nby things decided.’ ” State v. Miller, 841 N.W.2d 583, 586 (Iowa 2014)\n\n(quoting Stare decisis, Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009)). “From the\n\f                                     20\n\nvery beginnings of this court, we have guarded the venerable doctrine of\n\nstare decisis and required the highest possible showing that a precedent\n\nshould be overruled before taking such a step.” McElroy v. State, 703\n\nN.W.2d 385, 394 (Iowa 2005) (quoting Kiesau v. Bantz, 686 N.W.2d 164,\n\n180 n.1 (Iowa 2004) (Cady, J., dissenting) (citing Hildreth v. Tomlinson, 2\n\nGreene 360, 361 (Iowa 1849))). “Courts adhere to the holdings of past\n\nrulings to imbue the law with continuity and predictability and help\n\nmaintain the stability essential to society.” Miller, 841 N.W.2d at 586.\n\nAs we have repeatedly recognized,\n\n      [i]t is of the greatest importance that the law should be\n      settled. Fairness to the trial courts, to the legal profession,\n      and above all to citizens generally demands that\n      interpretations once made should be overturned only for the\n      most cogent reasons . . . .      Legal authority must be\n      respected; not because it is venerable with age, but because\n      it is important that courts, and lawyers and their clients,\n      may know what the law is and order their affairs\n      accordingly.\n\nState v. Liddell, 672 N.W.2d 805, 813 (Iowa 2003) (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Stuart v. Pilgrim, 247 Iowa 709, 714, 74 N.W.2d 212, 215–16\n\n(1956)).    Iowans have been able to rely on the immunity of drainage\n\ndistricts in choosing to form and operate those entities.\n\n      DMWW urges us to depart from stare decisis here.          It relies on\n\ncases such as Turner v. Turner, describing “our responsibility to\n\nreconsider     court-made    rules   when   their   continued   vitality   is\n\nquestionable.”    304 N.W.2d 786, 787 (Iowa 1981) (“When a rule is of\n\njudicial origin, it is subject to judicial change.”); see also Koenig v.\n\nKoenig, 766 N.W.2d 635, 646 (Iowa 2009) (abandoning common law\n\ndistinction between invitees and licensees in premises liability cases).\n\nThose decisions, however, did not involve judicial interpretation of\n\nstatutes.    “The rule of stare decisis ‘is especially applicable where the\n\f                                     21\n\nconstruction placed on a statute by previous decisions has been long\n\nacquiesced in by the legislature . . . .’ ” In re Estate of Vajgrt, 801 N.W.2d\n\n570, 574 (Iowa 2011) (quoting Iowa Dep’t of Transp. v. Soward, 650\n\nN.W.2d 569, 574 (Iowa 2002)). That is exactly what we have here. See\n\nChi. Cent. & Pac. R.R., 816 N.W.2d at 374. We reiterated our reliance on\n\n“the venerable principles of stare decisis and legislative acquiescence” in\n\nthe context of interpreting statutes in Doe v. New London Community\n\nSchool District, stating,\n\n      [W]e presume the legislature is aware of our cases that\n      interpret its statutes. When many years pass following such\n      a case without a legislative response, we assume the\n      legislature has acquiesced in our interpretation.\n\n             ....\n             . . . Overall, we think our legislature would be quite\n      surprised to learn if we decided to reverse course and take a\n      different position under the guise of statutory interpretation.\n\n848 N.W.2d 347, 355, 356 (Iowa 2014) (quoting Ackelson v. Manley Toy\n\nDirect, L.L.C., 832 N.W.2d 678, 688 (Iowa 2013) (citations omitted)).\n\n      Still, the principles of stare decisis and legislative acquiescence in\n\ncombination “are not absolute,” and we may overrule prior decisions\n\n“when error is manifest, including error in the interpretation of statutory\n\nenactments.” McElroy, 703 N.W.2d at 395 (quoting Miller v. Westfield Ins.\n\nCo., 606 N.W.2d 301, 306 (Iowa 2000)).        For example, in McElroy, we\n\nreinterpreted the Iowa Civil Rights Act to hold that a plaintiff seeking\n\nmoney damages is entitled to a jury trial, overruling Smith v. ADM Feed\n\nCorp., 456 N.W.2d 378 (Iowa 1990). McElroy, 703 N.W.2d at 395. Our\n\ncourt was narrowly divided in Smith, with four justices dissenting. Id. at\n\n393–94 (citing Smith, 456 N.W.2d at 387–88 (Carter, J., dissenting)). We\n\nobserved that the Smith dissent predicted problems resulting from the\n\nmajority’s interpretation that experience revealed in practice and that\n\f                                         22\n\nsubsequent changes in federal law “compounded the problems the\n\ndissent foretold.” Id. at 394. By contrast, our prior holdings that the\n\nDMWW seeks to overturn were unanimously reaffirmed by our court in\n\n1994 and 2012 without any intervening changes in the law underlying\n\nthe immunity.\n\n         C. DMWW’s Arguments for Revisiting Our Precedent. We next\n\naddress whether DMWW has provided compelling reasons for overruling\n\nour century of precedent interpreting chapter 468 that the legislature\n\nhas left intact. DMWW raises several arguments in this regard. First,\n\nDMWW argues immunity should not apply in a water pollution case in\n\nlight    of   the   evolution   in    the   understanding   of   environmental\n\ncontamination.       Second, it contends the enactment of the home rule\n\namendment to our state constitution in 1978 undermines the rationale\n\nfor the immunity.       Third, it claims the nitrate contamination at issue\n\nrebuts the public health rationale for drainage districts. Fourth, it points\n\nto decisions of other states allowing tort claims against drainage\n\ndistricts. Finally, it argues the immunity is unconstitutional as applied.\n\nWe address these arguments in turn.\n\n         1. The evolution of environmental law. The DMWW notes that none\n\nof our drainage district immunity decisions involved a claim for water\n\npollution.       According to DMWW, immunity was established decades\n\nbefore     the    environmental      movement   raised   consciousness   about\n\nprotecting water quality. Thus, the DMWW argues the historical basis\n\nfor immunity does not apply to pollution claims.\n\n         Upon our review, we disagree.        Changes in environmental laws\n\nhave not undermined the basis for the immunity—the limited scope and\n\npowers of drainage districts as entities. Our cases, old and new, closed\n\nthe door to tort claims against drainage districts “under any state of\n\f                                     23\n\nfacts.” Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 430. We applied the immunity in Fisher\n\neven though the drainage district in that case breached its statutory duty\n\nto maintain and repair the underground drain tile line, causing the\n\nrecurring floods in the plaintiff homeowner’s basement. Id. at 427–28.\n\nWe again applied the immunity four years ago, unanimously rejecting a\n\nrailroad’s reimbursement claim for repairing a blocked tile drain that the\n\ndrainage district was statutorily obligated to maintain. Chi. Cent. & Pac.\n\nR.R., 816 N.W.2d at 374. In both cases, we reaffirmed drainage district\n\nimmunity even though the harm to the plaintiff resulted from the\n\ndrainage district’s breach of its statutory duty to repair drain tiles.\n\n      Pollution claims do not present a stronger case to impose liability.\n\nChapter 468 imposes no duty on the districts to filter out nitrates.\n\nRather, chapter 468 simply requires drainage districts to maintain\n\ndrainage systems to keep the water flowing to drain lands.          See, e.g.,\n\nIowa Code § 468.126(1)(a) (requiring repairs as necessary to “restore or\n\nmaintain a drainage . . . improvement in its original efficiency or\n\ncapacity”). No provision in chapter 468 authorizes drainage districts to\n\nmandate changes in farming practices to reduce fertilizer runoff or to\n\nassess farmers for the costs of removing nitrates from waters flowing\n\nthrough agricultural drainage systems. It would therefore seem odd to\n\nmake an exception to drainage district immunity in this one area.\n\n      The defendants’ lack of statutory authority to regulate farmer\n\nnitrate use cuts against revisiting our long-standing precedent, which\n\nrests upon the limited existence and powers of drainage districts.\n\n“Liability follows control . . . .” Estate of McFarlin v. State, 881 N.W.2d\n\n51, 64 (Iowa 2016). A party in control of an activity can take precautions\n\nto reduce the risk of harm to others. See McCormick v.

These basic principles of tort law favor preserving, not\n\nabrogating, the immunity for drainage districts.\n\n      While attitudes toward the environment may differ today from\n\nwhen the first drainage tiles were placed generations ago, tort claims\n\nbased on alleged pollution are nothing new.        “Tort claims challenging\n\nenvironmental pollution can be traced back to at least the seventeenth\n\ncentury . . . .”   Freeman v. Grain Processing Corp., 848 N.W.2d 58, 66\n\n(Iowa 2014) (reviewing history of common law and statutory remedies for\n\npollution).   Iowa tort law has allowed nuisance claims to recover for\n\nenvironmental contamination for over a century. See id. at 67 (noting\n\nthat in Bowman v. Humphrey, 132 Iowa 234, 235–36, 243, 109 N.W.\n\n714, 714–15, 717 (1906), “the plaintiff landowner successfully sued a\n\f                                   25\n\ncreamery on a nuisance theory for depositing refuse in a running stream\n\nthat injured the lower riparian owner”). Those tort claims have coexisted\n\nwith drainage district immunity, weakening the DMWW’s argument that\n\nchanges in environmental laws support abrogating that immunity.\n\n      In Freeman, we noted “the 1960s and 1970s saw the development\n\nof significant statutory approaches to pollution.”     848 N.W.2d at 68.\n\nThese included the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and Clean Water Act\n\n(CWA) as well as Iowa Code chapter 455B, the state counterpart to those\n\nenactments.    See id. at 69–72 (contrasting statutory and common law\n\nremedies for pollution). We held the CAA and Iowa Code chapter 455B\n\ndid not preempt state common law claims by neighboring private\n\nproperty owners against a private corn milling facility. Id. at 63–64, 94.\n\nWe noted, “[T]he EPA has created a vast regulatory structure to control\n\nthe emission of air pollutants, including technological standards, health\n\nstandards, risk levels, and enforcement provisions . . . .”     Id. at 68\n\n(quoting Alexandra B. Klass, State Innovation and Preemption: Lessons\n\nfrom State Climate Change Efforts, 41 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 1653, 1686\n\n(2008)). The same is true for water pollution addressed under the CWA.\n\nSee Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut, 564 U.S. 410, 419, 131 S. Ct.\n\n2527, 2535, 180 L. Ed. 2d 435, 444 (2011) (“[The CWA] installed an all-\n\nencompassing     regulatory   program,    supervised     by   an   expert\n\nadministrative agency, to deal comprehensively with interstate water\n\npollution.”). Yet this proliferation of environmental laws has not led us\n\nor the legislature to revisit our precedent limiting judicial remedies\n\nagainst drainage districts.\n\n      Significantly, Iowa Code section 455E.6 expressly immunizes\n\nfarmers who comply with fertilizer label instructions from liability for\n\nnitrate contamination, including money damage claims or cleanup\n\f                                          26\n\ncosts. 5 We defer to the legislature whether to reassess that policy choice.\n\nSee Galloway v. State, 790 N.W.2d 252, 259 (Iowa 2010) (Cady, J.,\n\ndissenting) (“[P]ublic policy is best left to our legislative branch of\n\ngovernment to decide as representatives of the people.”).                     With that\n\nstatutory immunity for nitrate costs on the books, it is difficult to argue\n\nour precedents immunizing drainage districts should be overruled.\n\nIndeed, because farmers are assessed for the costs of drainage districts,\n\none might characterize state-law nitrate-based claims against drainage\n\ndistricts as a way to get backdoor relief against farmers that the\n\nlegislature has specifically barred through the front door.\n\n      Drainage districts provide a conduit for draining water. In other\n\ncontexts, the legislature has imposed cleanup obligations on entities\n\noperating conduits carrying contaminated water.                 See, e.g., Iowa Code\n\n      5Iowa   Code section 455E.6 provides,\n              This chapter supplements other legal authority and shall not\n      enlarge, restrict, or abrogate any remedy which any person or class of\n      persons may have under other statutory or common law and which\n      serves the purpose of groundwater protection. An activity that does not\n      violate chapter 455B or 459, subchapters II and III, does not violate this\n      chapter. In the event of a conflict between this section and another\n      provision of this chapter, it is the intent of the general assembly that this\n      section prevails.\n              Liability shall not be imposed upon an agricultural producer for\n      the costs of active cleanup, or for any damages associated with or\n      resulting from the detection in the groundwater of any quantity of\n      nitrates provided that application has been in compliance with soil test\n      results and that the applicator has properly complied with label\n      instructions for application of the fertilizer. Compliance with the above\n      provisions may be raised as an affirmative defense by an agricultural\n      producer.\n              Liability shall not be imposed upon an agricultural producer for\n      costs of active cleanup, or for any damages associated with or resulting\n      from the detection in the groundwater of pesticide provided that the\n      applicator has properly complied with label instructions for application of\n      the pesticide and that the applicator has a valid appropriate applicator’s\n      license. Compliance with the above provisions may be raised as an\n      affirmative defense by an agricultural producer.\n\f                                         27\n\n§ 358.16 (providing sanitary districts with the power to provide for\n\nsewage disposal); id. § 455B.307 (prohibiting dumping solid waste into\n\nany place other than sanitary disposal project); see also id. § 455B.186\n\n(“A pollutant shall not be disposed of by dumping, depositing, or\n\ndischarging such pollutant into any water of the state . . . except . . .\n\nadequately treated sewage . . . .”); id. § 455B.173 (instructing agency to\n\nset forth water standards for sewage systems and waterworks); Iowa\n\nAdmin. Code r. 567—62.3 (setting forth treatment standards for publicly\n\nowned treatment works and sewage disposal systems).                  This indicates\n\nour legislature has responded to changing environmental attitudes.\n\nUnlike with sanitary districts, the Iowa legislature has not imposed\n\nduties on drainage districts to treat contaminants. 6\n\n       “[A] drainage district is a legislative creation which has no rights or\n\npowers other than those found in statutes which give and sustain its\n\nlife.” State ex rel. Iowa Emp’t Sec. Comm’n, 260 Iowa at 345, 149 N.W.2d\n\nat 291. Iowa Code chapter 468 empowers drainage districts to\n\n       restore or maintain a drainage or levee improvement in its\n       original efficiency or capacity, and for that purpose may\n       remove silt, debris, repair any damaged structures, remove\n       weeds and other vegetable growth, and whatever else may be\n       needed to restore or maintain such efficiency or capacity to\n       prolong its useful life.\n\nIowa Code § 468.126(1)(a) (emphasis added). An improvement is further\n\ndefined as “a project intended to expand, enlarge, or otherwise increase\n\nthe capacity of any existing ditch, drain, or other facility above that for\n\n\n        6The fact the CWA expressly exempts agricultural runoff further undermines the\n\nview that changing environmental attitudes warrants revisiting our precedent on\ndrainage district immunity. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(14) (defining “point source” to exclude\n“agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture”). No\ncourt or agency to date has ruled agricultural drainage systems constitute point\nsources regulated under the CWA.\n\f                                           28\n\nwhich it was designed.”           Id. § 468.126(4).      Thus, under the express\n\nlanguage of the statute, the drainage district is empowered only to\n\n“restore,” “maintain,” or “increase” the flow of water through the drainage\n\nsystem.      Id. § 468.126(1), (4).        The legislature has not authorized\n\ndrainage districts to assess costs to redesign existing drainage systems to\n\nabate nitrates. This further supports our conclusion that the changing\n\nenvironmental attitudes should not undermine our long-standing\n\nprecedents limiting judicial relief against drainage districts.\n\n       Drainage districts and their trustees have presumably relied on\n\nour long-standing precedent recognizing their immunity. One practical\n\nresult of that reliance is the lack of liability insurance to cover defense\n\ncosts or indemnify judgments. 7             Perhaps some citizens would have\n\ndeclined to serve as drainage district trustees if they knew they could\n\nface uninsured litigation liability.        Public property, including funds in\n\nbank accounts necessary for the general purpose of the public entity, is\n\nexempt from execution. See Reg’l Util. Serv. Sys. v. City of Mount Union,\n\n874 N.W.2d 120, 127 (Iowa 2016) (applying Iowa Code § 627.18).\n\nChapter 468 contains no mechanism allowing drainage districts to raise\n\n\n       7Other   courts have noted that reliance on stare decisis affects decisions whether\nto purchase liability insurance. See, e.g., State v. Peeler, 140 A.3d 811, 857 (Conn.\n2016) (Zarella, J., dissenting) (stating courts should evaluate whether overruling\nprecedent would “cause a significant reordering of individual conduct, including risk\nshifting arrangements such as insurance policies”); City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A.\nCorp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1144 (Ill. 2004) (rejecting city’s public nuisance claim against\nfirearm manufacturers, noting “the expectations of potential defendants, both business\nentities and individuals, and their insurers would be upset substantially if an entirely\nnew scheme of liability were imposed”); Crist v. Hunan Palace, Inc., 89 P.3d 573, 580\n(Kan. 2004) (declining to overrule precedent, noting “[i]nsureds and insurers alike ha[d]\nrelied upon” the prior decisions); Paige v. City of Sterling Heights, 720 N.W.2d 219, 228\n(Mich. 2006) (recognizing “where an entire class of individuals or businesses purchase\ninsurance and another entire class does not in reliance on a decision by this Court, this\nmay be viewed as the sort of reliance that could cause ‘practical real-world\ndislocations’ ”).\n\f                                            29\n\ntaxes to pay off a judgment for pollution costs, and even taxes assessed\n\nfor a drainage improvement are subject to veto by a majority of\n\nlandowners. See Iowa Code § 468.126(4)(c). By contrast, other statutes\n\nallow cities and counties to raise taxes to pay off judgments. 8                    If the\n\nlegislature had intended to allow tort claims against drainage districts, it\n\npresumably       would     have    provided      a   funding     mechanism        to   pay\n\njudgments, as it did for cities and counties. 9 The absence of such a\n\nprovision in chapter 468 reinforces our long-standing interpretation\n\nprecluding tort claims against drainage districts under any set of facts.\n\n       Another reason to decline the DMWW’s invitation to abrogate\n\nimmunity for pollution claims is the absence of any evidence or argument\n\nthat drainage districts are the cheapest cost avoider for nitrate\n\ncontamination. The drainage systems were not designed or intended to\n\nfilter out nitrates. DMWW does not suggest it would be cheaper for the\n\ndrainage districts to remove nitrates from multiple locations than for\n\n\n       8Iowa Code section 626.24 authorizes cities to levy taxes to pay off judgments,\nand provides in relevant part,\n       If no property of a municipal corporation again which execution has\n       issued can be found, or if the judgment creditor elects not to issue\n       execution against such corporation, a tax must be levied as early as\n       practicable to pay off the judgment.\nSee also Iowa Code § 331.430 (authorizing debt service funded by county to pay\njudgments). There are no such statutory provisions allowing drainage districts to levy\ntaxes to pay tort judgments.\n         9As counsel for the DMWW acknowledged at oral argument, further litigation\n\nwould be required to allocate liability among numerous drainage districts. Such cost\nsharing could be further complicated by remonstrance petitions objecting to a drainage\ndistrict’s tax assessments. See Iowa Code § 468.126(4)(c). By contrast, the DMWW can\nspread its cost of nitrate removal by raising its water rates. The Illinois Supreme Court\naptly observed that when “a system already exists for the rational allocation of costs . . .\nthere is little reason for a court to impose an entirely new system of allocation.” Beretta\nU.S.A. Corp., 821 N.E.2d at 1145. Moreover, “the legislature is better able to consider\n[the] need for cost-recovery legislation” in response to an alleged ongoing public\nnuisance. Id. at 1147.\n\f                                     30\n\nDMWW to remove nitrates from a single location.           Economic theory\n\nunderlying tort law favors placing liability on the party who can avoid the\n\nharm at the least cost. See Holtz v. J.J.B. Hilliard W.L. Lyons, Inc., 185\n\nF.3d 732, 743 (7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that rules should be set to\n\nimpose liability on the party who is the “least-cost avoider”—that is, the\n\nparty who can avoid the mistake at the lowest price); Beyond the Garden\n\nGate, Inc. v. Northstar Freeze-Dry Mfg., Inc., 526 N.W.2d 305, 310 (Iowa\n\n1995) (noting that imposing liability on the “least cost risk avoider . . .\n\nminimize[s] the total loss to society” (quoting James J. White & Robert S.\n\nSummers, Uniform Commercial Code § 11–5, at 539–40 (3d ed. 1988)));\n\nGuido Calabresi, The Costs of Accidents: A Legal and Economic Analysis\n\n135 & n.1 (1970) (arguing that the burden of a legal rule should be\n\nplaced on the party who is best positioned and motivated to avoid the\n\nharm in the future). The least-cost avoider for removing nitrates from\n\ndrinking water may well be the DMWW, which already bears the\n\nstatutory obligation to provide safe water for its customers under the\n\nSafe Drinking Water Act and its Amendments, 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f–300j.\n\nThe DMWW does not claim otherwise and, indeed, itself at times has\n\nlawfully deposited back into the Raccoon River the very nitrates it\n\nremoved. 10\n\n      The argument has been made that “case-by-case adjudication” by\n\nthe Iowa courts is superior to “legislatively imposed command and\n\ncontrol regulation.”   We do not share that view.      Affected parties are\n\nbeing subjected to “commands” and “controls” whether these come from\n\na legislature, regulatory agency, or a court. The difference is that statutes\n\n\n      10Iowa Dep’t Nat. Res., National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\n\n(NPDES) Permit No. 7727000, at 3 (May 1, 2015).\n\f                                      31\n\nand regulations have been approved by one or more elected branches of\n\ngovernment who are responsible to the people. Also, these statutes and\n\nregulations usually have been developed by parties with expertise, rather\n\nthan generalist judges. And they are enacted and published in advance\n\nso the public knows what the rules are. Case-by-case adjudication, on\n\nthe other hand, offers none of those advantages.\n\n        The Supreme Court, in a decision holding the CAA supplanted\n\nfederal common law claims asserted by several states and private parties\n\nsuing    over    power   plant   emissions,    compared    the   institutional\n\ncompetency of courts and regulators in addressing pollution as follows:\n\n              It is altogether fitting that Congress designated an\n        expert agency, here, EPA, as the best suited to serve as\n        primary regulator of greenhouse gas emissions. The expert\n        agency is surely better equipped to do the job than\n        individual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case\n        injunctions. Federal judges lack scientific, economic, and\n        technological resources an agency can utilize in coping with\n        issues of this order. Judges may not commission scientific\n        studies or convene groups of experts for advice, or issue\n        rules under notice-and-comment procedures inviting input\n        by any interested person, or seek the counsel of regulators in\n        the States where the defendants are located. Rather, judges\n        are confined by a record comprising the evidence the parties\n        present.\n\nAm. Elec. Power Co., 564 U.S. at 428, 131 S. Ct. at 2539–40, 180\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 450 (citation omitted).       For all these reasons, we are not\n\npersuaded to overrule our precedent in light of heightened environmental\n\nconcerns.\n\n        2. The home rule amendment.           The DMWW next argues the\n\nenactment of the home rule amendment in 1978 broadened the police\n\npowers of county government. That amendment granted counties “home\n\nrule power and authority, not inconsistent with the laws of the general\n\nassembly.”      Iowa Const. art. III, § 39A; see also Worth Cty. Friends of\n\f                                           32\n\nAgric. v. Worth County, 688 N.W.2d 257, 265 (Iowa 2004) (recognizing the\n\n“superior authority of the General Assembly” (quoting Bechtel v. City of\n\nDes Moines, 225 N.W.2d 326, 332 (Iowa 1975))). Iowa Code chapter 468,\n\nhowever, remained unchanged.               This case turns on the duties and\n\npowers of drainage districts.        The county supervisors merely act in a\n\nrepresentative capacity as trustees of the drainage districts under\n\nchapter 468.         Nothing in the home rule amendment broadens the\n\nsupervisors’ operational authority over drainage districts or gives\n\ndrainage districts the power to regulate farming practices or water\n\nquality.     We have repeatedly reaffirmed the immunity of drainage\n\ndistricts well after the enactment of the home rule amendment because\n\ndrainage districts have limited powers. See Chi. Cent. & Pac. R.R., 816\n\nN.W.2d at 374; Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 430. Drainage districts lack the\n\nbroad      police    powers    exercised    by     counties   and   other   political\n\nsubdivisions.\n\n        Home rule powers can only be exercised in a manner consistent\n\nwith acts of the general assembly.          See Iowa Const. art. III, § 39A.       A\n\nstate statute trumps inconsistent local acts. The DMWW’s position that\n\nthe home rule amendment abrogated drainage district immunity conflicts\n\nwith chapter 468 as we have interpreted it for over a century.                  That\n\nprovides another reason for declining to read into the home rule\n\namendment any intent to overrule our statutory interpretation of chapter\n\n468 immunizing drainage districts.\n\n        We    also    note    the   home    rule     amendment      prohibits   local\n\ngovernments from assessing taxes without legislative authorization. Id.\n\n(“Counties . . . shall not have power to levy any tax unless expressly\n\nauthorized by the general assembly.”).              The legislature has expressly\n\nallowed counties to levy taxes to pay off tort judgments. See Iowa Code\n\f                                     33\n\n§ 626.24. No such provision allows drainage districts to levy taxes to pay\n\noff tort judgments. The legislature has authorized drainage districts to\n\nlevy taxes solely to construct and maintain drainage systems to drain\n\nwater.   Id. § 468.127.   The limited powers of drainage districts have\n\nremained unchanged since the enactment of the home rule amendment.\n\n       3. Public health. The DMWW also contends that its allegations of\n\nnitrate contamination should eliminate the historical immunity of\n\ndrainage districts because they rebut the statutory purpose of drainage\n\ndistricts to benefit “public health.”     It is true that Iowa Code section\n\n468.2 codifies a legislative presumption that the “drainage from\n\nagricultural lands . . . shall be presumed to be a public benefit and\n\nconducive to the public health, convenience, and welfare.” Id. § 468.2(1).\n\nWe draw a different lesson from that language, however, than DMWW.\n\nThe legislature having adopted a legislative presumption that drainage\n\ndistricts are beneficial, it is not our role to adopt a different presumption.\n\nFurther, DMWW disregards two additional benefits of draining lands\n\npresumed by the legislature—the public’s “convenience[] and welfare.”\n\nId.   Drainage districts convert economically unproductive swamps into\n\ntillable farmland.\n\n       Ultimately, this case is about who pays for nitrate removal from\n\nthe drinking water that reaches our kitchen faucets. The DMWW does\n\nnot claim nitrate levels render the Raccoon River unsafe for swimming or\n\nfishing. All parties agree the DMWW removes unsafe levels of nitrates\n\nfrom the water it provides to its customers.       The resulting cost to its\n\ncustomers, according to defendants, is about one cent per day added to\n\ntheir water bills. The DMWW does not challenge that estimate. It is for\n\nthe legislature to decide whether to reallocate the costs of nitrate\n\nreduction. See In re Estate of Whalen, 827 N.W.2d 184, 194 (Iowa 2013)\n\f                                   34\n\n(declining to change the meaning of a statute in the guise of\n\ninterpretation and suggesting policy arguments for the change be\n\ndirected to the legislature).\n\n      4. The decisions of other state courts. The DMWW cites decisions\n\nfrom a handful of states allowing private persons to sue drainage\n\ndistricts in tort. None involved claims by a water utility or other public\n\nentity. Roark v. Macoupin Creek Drainage Dist., 738 N.E.2d 574, 579–80\n\n(Ill. App. Ct. 2000); Gerbers, Ltd. v. Wells Cty. Drainage Bd., 608 N.E.2d\n\n997, 998, 1000 (Ind. Ct. App. 1993); Dougan v. Rossville Drainage Dist.,\n\n757 P.2d 272, 279 (Kan. 1988); Lezina v. Fourth Jefferson Drainage Dist.,\n\n190 So. 2d 97, 100 (La. Ct. App. 1966); Landview Landscaping, Inc. v.\n\nMinnehaha Creek Watershed Dist., 569 N.W.2d 237, 240 (Minn. Ct. App.\n\n1997); Parriott v. Drainage Dist. No. 6, 410 N.W.2d 97, 99–100 (Neb.\n\n1987); Kilburn v. Fort Bend Cty. Drainage Dist., 411 S.W.3d 33, 36–37\n\n(Tex. App. 2013); Holytz v. City of Milwaukee, 115 N.W.2d 618, 625 (Wis.\n1962), superseded by statute as recognized by Milwaukee Metro.\n\nSewerage Dist. v. City of Milwaukee, 691 N.W.2d 658, 677 (Wis. 2005)\n\n(noting the adoption of statute codifying immunity for discretionary\n\nfunctions); see also Ark. State Highway Comm’n v. Steed, 411 S.W.2d 17,\n\n21 (Ark. 1967) (granting immunity for tort actions against “improvement\n\ndistricts” but allowing injunctive relief and compensation for taking\n\nprivate property).\n\n      In any event, these cases are inapposite because the immunity\n\nafforded drainage districts in Iowa is based on special features of\n\ndrainage districts under Iowa law and specific determinations of our\n\nlegislature in Iowa Code chapter 468. Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 430. We\n\nalso have held that drainage districts are not municipalities subject to\n\nsuit under Iowa’s Municipal Tort Claims Act.      Id.   That other states\n\f                                           35\n\npermit tort claims against drainage districts does not persuade us to\n\noverrule our holdings to the contrary.\n       5. The constitutionality of broad immunity for drainage districts.\n\nThe DMWW lastly argues broad immunity in favor of drainage districts is\n\nunconstitutional. We have confronted this argument before. In Gard, we\n\napplied the rational-basis test 11 and rejected state and federal equal\n\nprotection challenges to drainage district immunity from tort liability.\n\n521 N.W.2d at 698–99. We denied recovery to the families of two boaters\n\nwho died when their watercraft struck an underwater concrete deflector\n\njointly maintained by the drainage district in the Little Sioux River. Id. at\n\n697. We are not persuaded the DMWW’s claims over the cost of treating\n\ndrinking water are more compelling than the wrongful-death claims at\n\nissue in Gard. We apply Gard to reject the DMWW’s equal protection\n\nclaims.\n\n       We also reject the DMWW’s “takings” claim.                 The takings clause\n\nprovides, “Private property shall not be taken for public use without just\n\ncompensation first being made . . . .” Iowa Const. art. I, § 18 (emphasis\n\nadded). No private property is involved in this case. To the contrary, we\n\nhave a dispute among various public subdivisions that only exist by the\n\ngrace of the Iowa General Assembly.\n\n       The drainage districts have not unconstitutionally deprived the\n\nDMWW of any property. The Raccoon River is owned by the State of Iowa\n\nin trust for the public. See Estate of McFarlin, 881 N.W.2d at 63. The\n\n\n        11The DMWW argues we should apply strict scrutiny, but fails to cite any\n\nauthority applying strict scrutiny to a constitutional claim asserted by one public entity\nagainst another. Strict scrutiny is unwarranted when reviewing claims challenging a\nstate’s allocation of authority among political subdivisions. Herriman v. Bell, 590 F.3d\n1176, 1191 (10th Cir. 2010); Green v. City of Tucson, 340 F.3d 891, 902–03 (9th Cir.\n2003).\n\f                                           36\n\nDMWW does not own the water flowing in the Raccoon River, nor was it\n\ndenied access to that water. “This case involves public water supplies,\n\nnot private property. There can be no taking of a public resource . . . .”\n\nDel. Cty. Safe Drinking Coal., Inc. v. McGinty, No. 07–1782, 2008 WL\n\n2229269, at *1 n.1 (E.D. Penn. May 27, 2008).                   In City of Trenton v.\n\nNew Jersey, the United States Supreme Court rejected a takings claim\n\nunder the Fifth Amendment. 262 U.S. 182, 191–92, 43 S. Ct. 534, 538,\n\n67 L. Ed. 937, 942–43 (1923).             The City of Trenton operated a water\n\nutility and challenged the state’s license fee for diverting river water as\n\nan unconstitutional taking.          Id. at 183, 43 S. Ct. at 535, 67 L. Ed. at\n\n939–40.     The Court held that regardless of whether the city’s water\n\ntreatment facility was a proprietary or governmental function, the city\n\ncould not assert a takings claim against the state.                 Id. at 191–92, 43\n\nS. Ct. at 538, 67 L. Ed. at 943; see also City of Hugo v. Nichols, 656 F.3d\n\n1251, 1257 (10th Cir. 2011) (applying City of Trenton and its progeny to\n\nhold municipality could not “sue its parent state under a substantive\n\nprovision of the Constitution”); Bd. of Levee Comm’rs of the Orleans Levee\n\nBd. v. Huls, 852 F.2d 140, 142–43 (5th Cir. 1988) (holding political\n\nsubdivisions cannot assert just compensation claims against the state).12\n\n\n       12The  Court’s later holding in Gomillion v. Lightfoot does not undermine City of\nTrenton’s application here.       Gomillion, 364 U.S. 339, 347, 81 S. Ct. 125, 130,\n5 L. Ed. 2d 110, 116–17 (1960) (allowing racial gerrymandering challenge to state\nstatute altering boundaries of city). Gomillion stated that the analysis of City of Trenton\nand its progeny was confined to “the particular prohibitions of the Constitution\nconsidered in those cases.” Gomillion, 364 U.S. at 344, 81 S. Ct. at 128, 5 L. Ed. 2d at\n115. City of Trenton specifically dealt with the takings clause, at issue in this case.\nThus, Gomillion did not narrow City of Trenton in a way relevant to our analysis. More\nrecently, the Supreme Court approvingly cited City of Trenton in Ysursa v. Pocatello\nEducation Association when rejecting a challenge to Idaho law banning payroll\ndeductions for political activities for public employees. Ysursa, 555 U.S. 353, 362–63,\n129 S. Ct. 1093, 1100–01, 172 L. Ed. 2d 770, 779–80 (2009) (noting political\nsubdivisions are subordinate government entities and have “no privileges or immunities\nunder the federal constitution which [they] may invoke in opposition to the will of its\n\f                                          37\n\nWe reach the same conclusion under the Iowa Constitution.                        If the\n\nDMWW, a public entity, cannot assert a takings claim against the state,\n\nnor can it assert such a claim against another political subdivision of the\n\nstate—a drainage district created by state statute. 13\n\n       In Maben, we concluded downstream private landowners were not\n\nentitled to recover eminent domain payments from a drainage district for\n\nharm to their private property caused by the water flow. 187 Iowa at\n\n1063–64, 175 N.W. at 513–14; see also Monona County, 229 Iowa at 169–\n\n70, 294 N.W. at 311 (reversing injunction against drainage district to\n\nabate nuisance and holding drainage district “cannot create a nuisance\n\nwhile operating within the ambit of powers constitutionally delegated”).\n\nThe DMWW has no greater right to such payments than a private\n\ndownstream property owner.            We do not require compensation for an\n\nalleged regulatory taking when a statute permits the challenged conduct\n\nthat “substantially advances a legitimate state interest.”                Hunziker v.\n\nState, 519 N.W.2d 367, 370 (Iowa 1994) (citing Lucas v.

Ct. 431, 432, 77\nL. Ed. 1015, 1020 (1933))).\n       13A  state political subdivision may have a takings claim against the federal\ngovernment because the federal government is a separate sovereign. United States v. 50\nAcres of Land, 469 U.S. 24, 31, 105 S. Ct. 451, 455–56, 83 L. Ed. 2d 376, 383 (1984)\n(concluding that property held by local government could be considered “private”\nproperty for takings purposes under the Fifth Amendment). Those federal takings cases\nare inapposite to a takings claim by a political subdivision against the sovereign that\ncreated it or another subdivision created by the same state government. See United\nStates v. Carmack, 329 U.S. 230, 242 n.12, 67 S. Ct. 252, 258 n.12, 91 L. Ed. 209, 217\nn.12 (1946) (“When . . . a sovereign state transfers its own public property from one\ngovernmental use to another, . . . a like obligation does not arise to pay just\ncompensation for it.”); see also Texas Dep’t of Transp. v.

The legislature has declared that the “drainage of surface\n\nwaters from agricultural lands . . . shall be presumed to be a public\n\nbenefit and conducive to the public health, convenience, and welfare.”\n\nIowa Code § 468.2(1). We give effect to that legislative presumption. See\n\nIn re Det. of Geltz, 840 N.W.2d 273, 275–76 (Iowa 2013) (relying on\n\ncodified legislative findings to interpret statute); State ex rel. Iowa Emp’t\n\nSec. Comm’n, 260 Iowa at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 391 (“In fact the drainage\n\nof surface waters from agricultural or other lands, or their protection\n\nfrom overflow, is presumed to be a public benefit and conducive to the\n\npublic health, convenience and welfare.”). 14 Chapter 468 substantially\n\nadvances a legitimate state interest, thereby defeating any regulatory\n\ntaking claim by the DMWW.\n\n       We also conclude the DMWW cannot assert constitutional claims\n\nagainst the drainage districts under the inalienable rights clause of our\n\nstate constitution. That provision protects the rights of citizens and does\n\nnot provide a basis for one public entity to sue another over the use of\n\nstate-owned assets. See City of Sioux City v. Jacobsma, 862 N.W.2d 335,\n\n348–53 (Iowa 2015) (reviewing history and scope of inalienable rights\n\nclause of the Iowa Constitution).\n       The DMWW relies on Gacke v. Pork Xtra, L.L.C., 684 N.W.2d 168\n\n(Iowa 2004), for its constitutional claims. That case is distinguishable as\n\ninvolving constitutional claims raised by private citizens. See id. at 170.\n\nJoseph and Linda Gacke had owned their farmstead since 1974. Id. at\n\n\n        14We note the legislature did not state that the presumption in section 468.2(1)\n\nis rebuttable, as it has expressly provided as to other statutory presumptions. See, e.g.,\nNeighbors v. Iowa Elec. Light & Power Co., 175 N.W.2d 97, 99 (Iowa 1970) (applying\nIowa Code section 489.15 (1962), which stated “[i]n case of injury to any person or\nproperty by any such transmission line, negligence will be presumed . . . but this\npresumption may be rebutted by proof”).\n\f                                      39\n\n170–71.      Two decades later, Pork Xtra built hog confinement facilities\n\nacross the road. Id. at 171. The Gackes filed a nuisance action, and\n\nPork Xtra asserted the statutory immunity for animal feeding operations\n\nin Iowa Code section 657.11(2) (1999) as an affirmative defense. Id. The\n\ndistrict court struck the defense as an unconstitutional taking and\n\nentered judgment in favor of the Gackes on their nuisance theory. Id.\n\nWe “conclude[d] the statutory immunity cannot constitutionally deprive\n\nprivate property owners of compensation for the decreased value of their\n\nproperty due to the statutory imposition of an easement for the operation\n\nof an animal feeding operation as a nuisance.”       Id. at 175 (emphasis\n\nadded).     As noted, our takings clause, by its terms, protects private\n\nproperty.     We found the evidence sufficient to establish the hog lot\n\ninterfered with the Gackes’ use and enjoyment of their privately owned\n\nhomestead.      Id. at 180–81.   By contrast, the DMWW alleges injury to\n\npublic waters used by a public utility, rather than any interference with\n\nprivate property.\n\n      In Gacke, we further held the immunity was unconstitutional\n\nunder the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution, article I,\n\nsection 1.     Id. at 179.   We reiterated that provision “was intended to\n\nsecure citizens’ pre-existing common law rights (sometimes known as\n\n‘natural rights’) from unwarranted government restrictions.” Id. at 176.\n\nWe concluded the immunity unconstitutionally hindered the Gackes’\n\nprivate property rights for the benefit of the defendant’s private business\n\noperated as a nuisance. Id. at 179.\n\n      We have never struck down a statutory immunity under the\n\ninalienable rights clause or as an unconstitutional taking in a dispute\n\nbetween public entities over use of a public resource. We decline to do so\n\nhere. Nor will we find a due process or equal protection violation in a\n\f                                    40\n\ndispute between public entities. As set forth above, our prior holdings\n\ncircumscribe the ability of the DMWW, a public utility created by the\n\nIowa legislature, to challenge the constitutionality of the immunity for\n\ndrainage districts provided in Iowa Code chapter 468. See In re A.W.,\n\n741 N.W.2d at 805; Bd. of Supervisors, 263 N.W.2d at 232–34; Keller,\n\n223 Iowa at 1377, 275 N.W. at 97; McSurely, 140 Iowa at 170, 118 N.W.\n\nat 419; see also S. Macomb Disposal Auth. v. Township of Washington,\n\n790 F.2d 500, 505 (6th Cir. 1986) (“For the same reasons, a political\n\nsubdivision of a state cannot challenge the constitutionality of another\n\npolitical subdivision’s ordinance on due process and equal protection\n\ngrounds.”); Hous. Auth. of Kaw Tribe of Indians of Okla., 952 F.2d at\n\n1189–90; Village of Arlington Heights, 653 F.2d at 1153; City of\n\nNew Rochelle v. Town of Mamaroneck, 111 F.

That is why the legislature\n\nenacted Iowa Code section 679A.19 to prohibit litigation between state\n\ndepartments, boards, and commissions. Iowa Individual Health Benefit\n\nReins. Ass’n v. State Univ. of Iowa, 876 N.W.2d 800, 811 (Iowa 2016)\n\n(citing H.F. 594, 58th G.A., Reg. Sess., explanation (Iowa 1959)). We see\n\f                                     41\n\nno cogent reason to overrule our precedent holding that subordinate\n\npublic entities cannot challenge the constitutionality of statutes enacted\n\nby the legislature that created them.\n\n      Even if we regarded the DMWW as a private entity and accepted its\n\nfactual allegations as true, no compensable takings claim is alleged\n\nunder the Iowa Constitution. The DMWW was not denied access to the\n\nRaccoon River; rather, it simply must expend additional funds for nitrate\n\nremoval. The DMWW cites no case supporting the proposition that the\n\npresence of nitrates in raw river water above the level allowed for\n\ndrinking water in homes results in a compensable taking of a riparian\n\nlandowner’s property right.      The cases hold otherwise.      See, e.g.,\n\nMildenberger v. United States, 643 F.3d 938, 948 (Fed. Cir. 2011)\n\n(affirming summary judgment dismissing Fifth Amendment takings claim\n\nby riparian owner for water pollution); Ancarrow v. City of Richmond, 600\n\nF.2d 443, 448 (4th Cir. 1979) (holding private marina owner had “no\n\nriparian right or other property right which was ‘taken’ by the city’s\n\npollution of the James River”). The DMWW’s claim that putting nitrates\n\ninto the Raccoon River creates a public nuisance is at odds with its own\n\npractice of depositing those nitrates back into the same river. Under the\n\ncircumstances, it has failed to state an actionable takings claim under\n\nthe Iowa Constitution.\n\n      IV. Conclusion.\n\n      For the reasons explained in this opinion, we answer the four\n\ncertified questions as set forth above.\n\n      CERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\n\n      Mansfield and Zager, JJ., join this opinion. Cady, C.J., concurs in\n\npart and dissents in part.    Appel, J., concurs in part and dissents in\n\npart, joined by Cady, C.J. Wiggins and Hecht, JJ., take no part.\n\f                                      42\n                                    #16–0076, Bd. of Water Works Trustees\n                                             v. Sac Cty. Bd. of Supervisors\n\nCADY, Chief Justice (concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I join in the partial concurrence and dissent by Justice Appel. I\n\nwrite separately to build upon an important point of this federal litigation\n\nand to add another.\n\n      The role of this court is not to decide the outcome of the case, but\n\nto determine if the basis of the lawsuit is supported by our state law. It\n\nis abundantly clear that Iowa’s drainage district law did not originate and\n\nwas not developed over time with the thought that a drainage district\n\ncould be a polluter.     If it had, I am convinced our law would have\n\ndeveloped in a way that would have recognized a clear remedy.\n\n      Nevertheless, the equitable remedies now asserted are not new to\n\nour law; they are only difficult to see in the context of this case. That\n\ndifficulty is not, however, a reason to dismiss the case, especially when\n\nthe facts in evidence have not yet been presented. The seriousness of\n\nfacts can often help to see the             availability of equitable relief.\n\nFurthermore,    law   develops    through    our   changed   understanding,\n\nincluding our understanding of the environmental impact of drainage\n\ndistricts. One of the fundamental principles of law is for remedies to be\n\navailable when we discover wrongs. Pollution of our streams is a wrong,\n\nirrespective of its source or its cause.\n\n      I believe the focus of our attention should be the end to which this\n\nlawsuit is directed. This state is blessed with fertile soil, vast expanses of\n\nteeming wilderness, and an overwhelming abundance of fresh water. The\n\nrole and purpose of drainage districts in Iowa is important, but no more\n\nimportant than this state’s enduring role of good stewardship.           This\n\nlawsuit serves to reinforce the critical balance at stake and asks the\n\f                                       43\n\nrhetorical question posited years ago by one of the founders of modern\n\nconservation, “What good is an undrained marsh anyhow?” 15 We should\n\nrespond when this balance has shifted too far in either direction.\n\n      The law of this state is but a reflection of the values of its people.\n\nAs we go forward as a people, so too must the law advance our values.\n\nWe can do this by applying existing remedies in new ways or by applying\n\nnew remedies to our existing values.         This concept of remedy is not\n\nexclusive to the judicial branch. We all can engage in this discussion\n\nand act. As every farmer knows, the work is never done.\n\n      For these reasons and for the reasons stated by Justice Appel, I\n\nconcur in part and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n     15Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There 100 (Spec.\n\nCommemorative ed. 1989).

Bd. of Supervisors\n\nAPPEL, Justice (concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I cannot join the majority opinion.    Nonetheless, for the reasons\n\nexpressed below, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n      I. Introduction.\n\n      A. What Is Presented: Significant Issues—Ghosts and Goblins.\n\nThis case touches upon some difficult and profound issues in our law.\n\nThese issues include the nature of riparian water rights, the proper\n\napproach, if any, to controlling pollution of rivers and streams as a result\n\nof common agricultural practices, and the ability of a government\n\nsubdivision to assert claims based on allegations of water pollution\n\nagainst another governmental subdivision.\n\n      For purposes of this case I, like the majority, assume the facts that\n\nhave been provided to us by the federal district court in this certified\n\nquestion matter. Under the district court’s certification order, we are to\n\nassume that the defendant drainage districts are collecting agricultural\n\nrunoff that is then discharged into the Raccoon River and that the runoff\n\nis so polluted with nitrates that the water withdrawn by the Des Moines\n\nWater Works (DMWW) does not meet the health and safety standards of\n\nthe Safe Drinking Water Act as amended. See 42 U.S.C. § 300g-1 (2012).\n\nAs a result of the noncompliance, the DMWW expends significant funds\n\nto remove the nitrates from the water before the water is sold to its\n\ncustomers.   DMWW seeks to recover damages for past cleanup efforts\n\nand an injunction to prevent the defendants from continuing to pollute\n\nthe Raccoon River in the future.\n\n      To consider the issues, I first explore the contours of our law\n\nrelated to drainage districts.   Taking the facts provided by the federal\n\ndistrict court as true, I then consider whether money damages are\n\f                                    45\n\navailable under our caselaw and applicable statutes.       I then consider\n\nwhether any alleged limitation in the power of drainage districts to pay\n\nmoney damages gives rise to a state constitutional claim rooted in the\n\ndue process, equal protection, or inalienable rights clauses of the Iowa\n\nConstitution.    I thereafter explore the law or remedies as well as the\n\nsubstance of the law of nuisance.\n\n         Finally, I consider whether DMWW may bring a takings claim\n\nagainst the defendants because of its alleged pollution of the Raccoon\n\nRiver.    I consider whether property interests are involved, whether the\n\nproperty interests are “private” for the purposes of takings law, and\n\nwhether DMWW has standing to bring a takings claim against the\n\ndrainage district defendants.\n\n         B. What Is Not Presented: False Trails.     Before launching into\n\nthe substantive analysis, it is important to emphasize what this case is\n\nnot about. It raises no question about who owns the water—all agree\n\nthat the state owns the water. See Iowa Code § 455B.171(39) (2015). It\n\nraises no question of navigation rights. See Gibson v. United States, 166\n\nU.S. 269, 271–72, 17 S. Ct. 578, 579, 41 L. Ed. 996, 1000 (1897).         It\n\nraises no question of allocation of limited quantities of water. See City of\n\nTrenton v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 182, 185, 43 S. Ct. 534, 536, 67 L. Ed.\n\n937, 940 (1923). It raises no question of flooding related to the operation\n\nof drainage districts. See Sanguinetti v. United States, 264 U.S. 146, 150,\n\n44 S. Ct. 264, 265, 68 L. Ed. 608, 610–11 (1924).\n\n         All the legal questions raised in this case revolve around the\n\nallegation made by the DMWW that the drainage district defendants have\n\nconducted drainage district operations in a way that has caused\n\nunlawful pollution of the waters of the Raccoon River which DMWW uses\n\f                                    46\n\nfor purposes of providing water to its customers.       In short, this is a\n\npollution case.\n\n     II. Setting the Table: Overview of Drainage District and\nNuisance Law.\n\n      A. Introduction. Before diving into the issues, it is important to\n\nhave a bird’s-eye overview of the relevant law. I begin by surveying the\n\nconstitutional environment as the starting point for consideration of the\n\nissues raised in this case.    I next turn to the statutory environment,\n\nincluding not only the statutory framework for drainage districts but the\n\nstatutory provisions related to nuisance and water pollution.         These\n\nstatutory provisions are important because the interrelationship between\n\nenvironmental law and drainage district law is at the heart of this case.\n\nFinally, I briefly review the common law of nuisance, which is not\n\npreempted by either statutory nuisance or any other environmental\n\nstatute.\n\n      B. Constitutional Environment.\n\n      1. Article I, section 18: Authorization of drainage districts. Drainage\n\ndistricts are authorized by the eminent domain article of the Iowa\n\nConstitution.     This constitutional provision authorizes the general\n\nassembly to\n\n      pass laws permitting the owners of lands to construct\n      drains, ditches, and levees for agricultural . . . purposes\n      across the lands of others, and provide for the organization\n      of drainage districts, vest the proper authorities with power\n      to construct and maintain levees, drains and ditches and to\n      keep in repair all drains, ditches, and levees heretofore\n      constructed under the laws of the state, by special\n      assessments upon the property benefited thereby.\n\nIowa Const. art. I, § 18.\n\n      Further, article I, section 18 provides for condemnation powers for\n\ndrainage districts: “The general assembly may provide by law for the\n\f                                     47\n\ncondemnation of such real estate as shall be necessary for the\n\nconstruction and maintenance of such drains, ditches and levees, and\n\nprescribe the method of making such condemnation.” Id.\n\n      2. Article III, section 39A: County home rule.    In 1978, the Iowa\n\nConstitution was amended to provide for county home rule. Specifically,\n\narticle III, section 39A provides,\n\n      Counties or joint county-municipal corporation governments\n      are granted home rule power and authority, not inconsistent\n      with the laws of the general assembly, to determine their\n      local affairs and government, except that they shall not have\n      power to levy any tax unless expressly authorized by the\n      general assembly. . . .\n\n             ....\n\n            The proposition or rule of law that a county or joint\n      county-municipal corporation government possesses and\n      can exercise only those powers granted in express words is\n      not a part of the law of this state.\n\nIowa Const. art. III, § 39A.    This constitutional provision is important\n\nbecause it has potential application to a key issue in this case, namely,\n\nthe scope of power of drainage districts.\n\n      C. Iowa Statutory Environment.\n\n      1. Iowa Code chapter 468: The drainage district framework.       An\n\nelaborate and detailed statutory framework for drainage districts is\n\ncodified in Iowa Code chapter 468.        Under chapter 468, the board of\n\nsupervisors of a county is authorized to create a drainage district and\n\n“cause to be constructed” within the drainage district “any levee, ditch,\n\ndrain, or watercourse, or settling basins” and “to straighten, widen,\n\ndeepen, or change any natural watercourse” whenever such action will\n\nbe “of public utility or conducive to the public health, convenience or\n\nwelfare.” Iowa Code § 468.1.\n\f                                     48\n\n      Iowa Code section 468.2 further provides that the drainage of\n\nsurface waters from agricultural lands and other lands or the protection\n\nof lands from overflow is “presumed to be a public benefit and conducive\n\nto the public health, convenience, and welfare.”        The legislature has\n\ndirected that the provisions of laws related to drainage and protection\n\nfrom overflow “shall be liberally construed to promote leveeing, ditching,\n\ndraining, and reclamation of wet, swampy, and overflow lands.”          Id.\n\n§ 468.2(2).\n\n      The statute provides for the appointment of commissioners to\n\napportion and assess the costs and expenses of constructing proposed\n\nimprovements. Id. § 468.38. When the board of supervisors has finally\n\ndetermined the matter of assessments of benefits and apportionment for\n\ndrainage district improvements, the board is given the power to levy the\n\nassessments as fixed by it upon lands within the district. Id. § 468.50.\n\nThe law provides that such taxes “shall be paid out only for purposes\n\nproperly connected with and growing out of the county drainage and\n\nlevee districts on order of the board.” Id. § 468.54.\n\n      After a drainage district has been created and improvements\n\nconstructed, the statute authorizes repairs and additional improvements.\n\nWith respect to repairs, the board is authorized\n\n      to restore or maintain a drainage or levee improvement in its\n      original efficiency or capacity, . . . repair any damaged\n      structures, remove weeds and other vegetable growth, and\n      whatever else may be needed to restore or maintain such\n      efficiency or capacity or to prolong its useful life.\n\nId. § 468.126(1)(a).\n\n      The board is also authorized to construct improvements.           Id.\n\n§ 468.126(4). The term “improvement” is defined as “a project intended\n\nto expand, enlarge, or otherwise increase the capacity of any existing\n\f                                    49\n\nditch, drain, or other facility above that for which it was designed.” Id.\n\nCosts of improvements are to be paid out of drainage district funds or, if\n\nfunds are not sufficient, from assessments on land. Id. §§ 468.127, .147.\n\nThe assessments must be made at one time, but may be collected in\n\ninstallments.    Id. § 468.127.     In cases when current funds are\n\ninsufficient and the improvement cannot be funded by a single year’s\n\nlevy, the board may issue drainage bonds to finance the improvements.\n\nId. § 468.74.\n\n      Chapter 468 does not contain a provision that addresses potential\n\npollution arising from the operation of drainage districts.    There is a\n\nprovision in current law related to nuisance from overflow:\n\n            Any ditch, drain, or watercourse which is now or\n      hereafter may be constructed so as to prevent the surface\n      and overflow water from the adjacent lands from entering\n      and draining into and through the same is hereby declared a\n      nuisance and may be abated as such.\n\nId. § 468.150.\n\n      Notably, there are no provisions in chapter 468 specifically\n\ndeclaring that money damages may not be paid by a drainage district.\n\nFurther, there are no provisions expressly stating that generally\n\napplicable nuisance law does not apply against a drainage district.\n\nIndeed, there are no provisions of Iowa Code chapter 468 expressly\n\nexempting drainage districts from provisions of law germane to this case.\n\n      2. Iowa Code chapters 455A and B. Iowa Code chapters 455A and\n\nB provide the framework for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe purpose for creating the department is to protect “Iowa’s air, soils,\n\nwaters, and rich diversity of life” because “[t]he well-being and future of\n\nIowa depend on these natural resources.” Id. § 455A.15. The general\n\nassembly found “[t]here has been a significant deterioration in the quality\n\f                                    50\n\nof Iowa’s surface waters and groundwaters” because of human activity.\n\nId.; see also id. § 455B.262 (describing the importance to the state of\n\nprotecting “life and property from floods” and “the orderly development,\n\nwise use, protection, and conservation of the water resources of the\n\nstate”).\n\n       In order to accomplish this goal, the department “has the primary\n\nresponsibility for . . . managing fish, wildlife, and land and water\n\nresources in this state.” Id. § 455A.2; see also id. § 455A.16 (describing\n\nthe policy of the state of Iowa to protect Iowa’s waters, among other\n\nnatural resources, for the benefit of present and future citizens). The\n\ndirector of the department is required to cooperate with the Department\n\nof Agriculture and Land Stewardship in the “administration of programs\n\nrelating to water quality improvement and watershed improvements.” Id.\n\n§ 455A.4(1)(j).   The Environmental Protection Commission, created by\n\nIowa Code section 455A.6, is required to protect Iowa’s groundwater and\n\nwater supply and is directed to cooperate with “cities and other\n\nsubdivisions of the state” as well as landowners in actions “relating to\n\nflood control and the use of water resources.” Id. § 455B.263(7).\n\n       3. Iowa Code chapter 657: Statutory nuisance. Iowa Code section\n\n657.1 provides for a statutory nuisance civil action. Among other things,\n\nthis section states,\n\n       Whatever is injurious to health, indecent, or unreasonably\n       offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of\n       property . . . is a nuisance, and a civil action by ordinary\n       proceedings may be brought to enjoin and abate the\n       nuisance and to recover damages sustained on account of\n       the nuisance.\n\nId. § 657.1. Iowa Code section 657.2 then lists a number of actions or\n\nsituations that are nuisances under the chapter.         In particular, a\n\nnuisance includes “[t]he corrupting or rendering unwholesome or impure\n\f                                    51\n\nthe water of any river, stream, or pond, or unlawfully diverting the same\n\nfrom its natural course or state, to the injury or prejudice of others.” Id.\n\n§ 657.2(4).\n\n      Iowa Code section 657.3 provides criminal penalties related to\n\nnuisances:\n\n            Whoever is convicted of erecting, causing, or\n      continuing a public or common nuisance as provided in this\n      chapter, or at common law . . . , where no other punishment\n      therefor is specially provided, shall be guilty of an aggravated\n      misdemeanor and the court may order such nuisance\n      abated, and issue a warrant . . . .\n\n      Finally, chapter 657 provides for a process including the issuance\n\nof warrants to cause abatement of nuisances and describes how the\n\ncosts of abating a nuisance may be collected. Id. §§ 657.6–.7.\n\n      Chapter 657 provides a safe harbor for animal agricultural\n\nproducers who manage their operations in accordance with state or\n\nfederal law.   Id. § 657.11(1).    Aside from the exception for animal\n\nagricultural producers, there is no other agriculturally related exemption\n\nfrom nuisance law in Iowa Code chapter 657.         In Gacke v. Pork Xtra,\n\nL.L.C., however, we held that this exception was unconstitutional as a\n\nper se taking without just compensation.      684 N.W.2d 168, 185 (Iowa\n\n2004).\n\n      D. Iowa Common Law Environment.                 We have held that\n\nstatutory nuisance does not preempt a common law nuisance action.\n\nFreeman v. Grain Processing Corp., 848 N.W.2d 58, 70 (Iowa 2014);\n\nGuzman v. Des Moines Hotel Partners, Ltd. P’ship, 489 N.W.2d 7, 10\n\n(1992).   Thus, in addition to the statutory nuisance described in Iowa\n\nCode chapter 657, a common law claim remains available to persons\n\nalleging environmental harms. The elements of common law nuisance\n\nare “(1) unlawful or anti-social conduct that (2) in some way injures (3) a\n\f                                     52\n\nsubstantial number of people” for public nuisance and “an actionable\n\ninterference with a person’s interest in the private use and enjoyment of\n\nhis land” for private nuisance.    Pottawattamie County v. Iowa Dep’t of\n\nEnvtl. Quality, 272 N.W.2d 448, 453 (Iowa 1978) (second quote quoting\n\nPatz v. Farmegg Prods., Inc., 196 N.W.2d 557, 560 (Iowa 1972)); accord\n\nState ex rel. Turner v. Younker Bros. Inc., 210 N.W.2d 550, 564 (Iowa\n\n1973). We have held that pollution may constitute a public or private\n\nnuisance under the common law. See, e.g., Kasparek v. Johnson Cty. Bd.\n\nof Health, 288 N.W.2d 511, 520 (Iowa 1980); Pottawattamie County, 272\n\nN.W.2d at 453; Kriener v. Turkey Valley Cmty. Sch. Dist., 212 N.W.2d\n\n526, 531–32 (Iowa 1973); Bader v. Iowa Metro. Sewer Co., 178 N.W.2d\n\n305, 307 (Iowa 1970).\n\n      III. More Table Setting: Iowa Caselaw Involving Drainage\nDistricts and Environmental Regulation.\n\n      A. Introduction. I now turn to the caselaw related to drainage\n\ndistricts.   First, I examine the opinions on the nature of drainage\n\ndistricts and their powers. I then explore the cases regarding the legal\n\nduties of drainage districts that arise both within Iowa Code chapter 468\n\nand from external sources. Finally, I consider the caselaw applying the\n\nlaw of nuisance to agricultural concerns.\n\n      B. The Rise (and Fall) of “No Legal Entity” Theory. The older\n\nnotion that a drainage district is a nonjuristic entity is reflected in Clary\n\nv. Woodbury County, 135 Iowa 488, 113 N.W. 330 (1907). In that case,\n\nwe declared\n\n      [a drainage district] is not a person or a corporation. It is\n      nothing more than a definite body or district of land\n      constituting an improvement district. That it has no legal\n      entity is manifest from various sections [of the Code] which\n      place the entire matter under the control and supervision of\n      the board of supervisors.\n\f                                    53\n\nId. at 492, 113 N.W. at 332; see also Gish v. Castner-Williams & Askland\n\nDrainage Dist., 136 Iowa 155, 157, 113 N.W. 757, 757 (1907) (noting that\n\na drainage district “is not such [a] legal entity as is known to or\n\nrecognized by law as a proper party to adversary proceedings”).\n\n      The “no legal entity” doctrine at first seemed to stick. In Board of\n\nSupervisors v. District Court, we characterized a drainage district as\n\nmerely “a segregated area of land, which has been set out by legal\n\nproceedings, and is subject to assessment for the construction of certain\n\ndrainage improvements.”     209 Iowa 1030, 1033, 229 N.W. 711, 712\n\n(1930). Thus, a drainage district was simply a tract of land with metes\n\nand bounds that might be subject to improvement. It was acres of real\n\nestate, nothing more. You cannot sue the back forty.\n\n      Over time, however, the no-legal-entity theory began to fall apart.\n\nFor instance, in Wise v. Board of Supervisors, we considered a case in\n\nwhich the ditch of a drainage district was in poor repair such that it was\n\nnot operating properly. 242 Iowa 870, 872, 48 N.W.2d 247, 248 (1951).\n\nThe plaintiffs, owners of farmland in the district, petitioned the board of\n\nsupervisors to repair the ditch. Id. at 871, 48 N.W.2d at 248. The board\n\nabandoned the repair project, however, when other landowners objected\n\nto the expense. Id. at 872, 48 N.W.2d at 248.\n\n      In Wise, we held, however, that it was clear the “repairs are\n\nnecessary to make the drainage improvement function properly.” Id. at\n\n874, 48 N.W.2d at 249. We granted mandamus to order the board to\n\nmake the necessary improvements. Id. at 875, 48 N.W.2d at 249. We\n\nleft the manner in which to proceed within the sound discretion of the\n\nboard. Id. Wise plainly stands for the proposition that there is at least\n\none equitable remedy available to require drainage districts to perform a\n\nduty, namely, mandamus.\n\f                                            54\n\n       We drifted still further away from the no-legal-entity doctrine in\n\nWapello County v. Ward, 257 Iowa 1231, 136 N.W.2d 249 (1965).                         In\n\nWapello County, we considered a dispute over county zoning.                       Id. at\n\n1232, 136 N.W.2d at 249.             In passing, we noted that various bodies,\n\nincluding drainage districts, have long been known to the law but defined\n\n“only in regard to certain specific purposes.” Id. at 1235, 136 N.W.2d at\n\n251.    We characterized these various bodies as “quasi municipal\n\ncorporations.” Id. The discussion, however, was dictum.\n\n       But the Wapello County dictum was followed by a concrete holding\n\nin State ex rel. Iowa Employment Security Commission v. Des Moines\n\nCounty, 260 Iowa 341, 149 N.W.2d 288 (1967).                          In that case, we\n\nconsidered whether a drainage district could be considered a “juristic\n\nentity” for purposes of retirement benefits under Iowa Code chapter 97C.\n\nId. at 345, 149 N.W.2d at 290.              We concluded that drainage districts\n\nwere a juristic entity because a drainage district was a “legally\n\nrecognizable     or   identifiable    political       body,   unit,   organization,   or\n\ninstrumentality of the state or any one or more of its political\n\nsubdivisions.”    Id. at 345–46, 149 N.W.2d at 290–91.                  We said, “[A]n\n\norganized drainage district is a political subdivision of the county in\n\nwhich it is located, its purpose being to aid in the governmental\n\nfunctions   of    the   county.        It    is   a    legally   identifiable   political\n\ninstrumentality.” Id. at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291.\n\n       As a result, the district court’s holding that it lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction was overruled. Id. at 347, 149 N.W.2d at 291. Iowa\n\nEmployment Security demonstrates how far our cases have travelled from\n\nthe no-legal-entity doctrine of the earlier cases. See Gish, 136 Iowa at\n\n157, 113 N.W. at 757; Clary, 135 Iowa at 492, 113 N.W. at 332.\n\nDrainage districts were now being recognized for what they obviously\n\f                                     55\n\nwere: a political subdivision of the county in which they were located.\n\nSee Iowa Emp’t Sec. Comm’n, 260 Iowa at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291.\n\n       We declined to invoke the notion that a drainage district was not\n\nan entity in Voogd v. Joint Drainage District No. 3–11, 188 N.W.2d 387,\n\n393 (Iowa 1971).      In Voogd, plaintiff landowners sought to recover\n\npayments of past drainage assessments and to enjoin the counties’\n\ncollection of future assessments to pay for repairs.      Id. at 388.    The\n\nproblem in the case was that the counties originally approved the repair\n\nbased on low-ball estimates. Id. at 389. When costs skyrocketed, the\n\ncounties continued the repair project. Id. Plaintiffs cried foul.       Id. at\n\n390.\n\n       We agreed with the plaintiffs and held that future installments\n\ncould not be collected. Id. at 395. In addition, we ordered a refund of\n\nsome of the amount that the plaintiffs had already paid. Id. In Voogd,\n\nwe saw no problem in a drainage district being ordered to repay the\n\namount of funds previously collected.\n\n       Fourteen years later, in Fisher v. Dallas County, we considered a\n\ncase in which the plaintiff claimed to have experienced flooding problems\n\nbecause of the operation of a drainage district.     369 N.W.2d 426, 427\n\n(Iowa 1985). The plaintiffs in Fisher did not contest our prior holdings.\n\nId. at 429–30. We repeated the familiar refrain that drainage districts\n\nonly had those powers expressly conferred by the legislature. Id. at 429.\n\nOn the question of money damages, we offered the qualified observation\n\nthat drainage districts had no corporate existence “for that purpose.” Id.\n\nIn Fisher, we characterized the unavailability of money damages as\n\n“immunity from suit in tort.” Id. at 430.\n\n       Yet, Fisher cited Wise and Voogd with apparent approval. Id. at\n\n429. Fisher did so, in part, by linking the relief afforded in each case to a\n\f                                        56\n\nstatutory provision. Id. We stated that the mandamus afforded in Wise\n\nwas based upon a duty to maintain a drainage district imposed by Iowa\n\nCode section 455.135(1). Id. We stated that action in Voogd challenging\n\nthe validity of assessments was based on the power to levy assessments\n\nin Iowa Code section 455.45. Id.\n\n      The fighting issue in Fisher was whether the enactment of the\n\nMunicipal Tort Claims Act, Iowa Code chapter 613A (now chapter 670),\n\noverruled our prior cases on the immunity of drainage districts from\n\nsuits in tort. Id. Under the Act, “municipalities” were subject to liability\n\nin tort with certain exceptions.      Id. at 430.    In Fisher, we held that a\n\ndrainage district was not a municipality.           Id.   We reasoned that a\n\ndrainage district’s immunity from suits in tort did not rise or fall with the\n\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity.             Id. at 430.   We retreated to old\n\nformulations, including the dubious suggestion that a drainage district\n\nwas “merely an area of land.”         Id.    We did not cite Iowa Employment\n\nSecurity, which declared drainage districts were “a political subdivision of\n\nthe county in which it is located” and “a legally identifiable political\n\ninstrumentality,” 260 Iowa at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291, nor did we cite\n\nVoogd, which declared that drainage districts were “political subdivisions\n\nof counties,” 188 N.W.2d at 393.\n\n      Justice Larson dissented. Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 431 (Larson, J.,\n\ndissenting). He concluded that a drainage district was a “unit of local\n\ngovernment” under the Municipal Tort Claims Act and, as a result, was\n\namenable to tort law suits.     Id.     Although the dissent is cryptic, it is\n\napparent that Justice Larson was not buying the no-legal-entity\n\nargument. His dissent was more consistent with Wapello County, Iowa\n\nEmployment Security, and Voogd than the approach of the majority.\n\f                                    57\n\n      The next case of interest is Gard v. Little Sioux Intercounty Drainage\n\nDistrict, 521 N.W.2d 696 (Iowa 1994). In Gard, we rejected a claim for\n\nmoney damages by the estate of drowned boaters. Id. at 697, 699. We\n\ncited Fisher for the proposition that drainage districts have limited\n\npowers. Id. at 698. We emphasized the narrow proposition that “Iowa\n\nhas never allowed tort claims for money damages to be made against a\n\ndrainage district.” Id. (emphasis added). The focus in Gard was not on a\n\nno-legal-entity theory, but on the limited statutory power of drainage\n\ndistricts.\n\n      Finally, we considered a claim against a drainage district in\n\nChicago Central & Pacific Railroad v. Calhoun County Board of\n\nSupervisors, 816 N.W.2d 367 (Iowa 2012). A railroad sought to recover\n\nmonies voluntarily spent on repairs of a drainage district improvement.\n\nId. at 368.   The railroad in this case faced a conundrum.          See id.\n\nBecause of problems with a drainage ditch, it could not operate its\n\nrailroad. Id. Yet, it would take some time to get the drainage district to\n\nmove on the problem. Id. The railroad decided that instead of waiting\n\nfor the drainage district to resolve the problem, which could take\n\nconsiderable time, the railroad voluntarily performed the repair to get its\n\noperations up and running as soon as possible. Id. at 369. It then sued\n\nthe drainage district, seeking to recover the cost of the repair. Id. We\n\ndeclared that while the railroad could have filed a mandamus action to\n\nforce the railroad to make the repair, it could not, under our caselaw,\n\nseek money damages. Id. at 378. Chicago Central did not mention the\n\nno-legal-entity theory.\n\n      C. The Overflow Cases: Avoiding Statutory Suicide. Now I turn\n\nto what might be called “the overflow cases.” The classic overflow case\n\narises when downstream landowners complain when upland drainage\n\f                                    58\n\ndistricts, by removing water and directing it into rivers and streams,\n\ncause flooding downstream.\n\n      The seminal overflow case is Maben v. Olsen, 187 Iowa 1060, 175\n\nN.W. 512 (1919).     In Maben, we considered whether a downstream\n\nlandowner could obtain an injunction against a drainage district where\n\nthe activities of the drainage district caused overflow downstream. Id. at\n\n1063, 175 N.W. at 513.       In Maben, we characterized the controlling\n\nquestion as,\n\n      Is it unauthorized and unlawful to establish a drainage\n      district if so doing will cause water to come into the natural\n      outlet for the district more rapidly and in greater quantity\n      than if the land in the district were left to send its surface\n      water into said outlet without interference by a drainage\n      system, and if it further appears that the increase in rapidity\n      and volume may overtax the natural outlet and cause a\n      damaging overflow to lands below the entrance to such\n      outlet.\n\nId.\n\n      In Maben, we held that the Iowa Constitution expressly authorized\n\nthe legislature to give the board of supervisors the power to do precisely\n\nwhat we had described.      Id. at 1063–64, 175 N.W. at 513–14.         The\n\nspecific question was further characterized as whether the delegation of\n\npower to establish drainage systems “may be interfered with by a court of\n\nequity because, through its exercise, a more rapid and a greater flow will\n\nreach a natural outlet, to the possible or even probable injury of the\n\nlower owners.” Id. at 1065, 175 N.W. at 514. But, as we pointed out, the\n\n“cardinal purpose” of draining agricultural lands is acceleration and\n\nincreased overflow. Id.\n\n      In short, the result urged by the Maben plaintiff would ensure that\n\nthe power given to the drainage districts could not “be used to\n\naccomplish the only purpose for which it [was] given.”       Id.   In other\n\f                                    59\n\nwords, the legislature could not have intended overflow to be a nuisance\n\nbecause if it did drainage districts simply could not function.              Id.\n\nApplication of generally applicable nuisance law was thus flatly\n\ninconsistent with the specific purpose of drainage districts.\n\n      It is hard to argue against the reasoning in Maben. Indeed, prior\n\nto the enactment of article I, section 18, the biggest obstacle to draining\n\nfarmland was securing the right to drain water onto the land of another.\n\nSee Joseph W. Otto, Subject to Overflow: The History of Drainage Districts\n\nin Jasper County, Iowa 25 (Aug. 2012) (unpublished M.A. dissertation,\n\nAppalachian     State    University),    https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/\n\nOtto,%20Joseph_2012_Thesis.pdf.          Article   I,   section   18   and   the\n\nimplementing statutes were designed to eliminate the problem—that is\n\nwhy Maben is clearly correct.\n\n      But it is important to note the narrowness of the reasoning and its\n\nholding.   Clearly, Maben had nothing to do with a claim arising from\n\nalleged pollution. And, in fact, the Maben court went to great lengths to\n\ndistinguish cases involving pollution of waterways by government\n\nentities, thereby demonstrating the narrowness of its holding. 187 Iowa\n\nat 1068–70, 175 N.W. at 515–16; see, e.g., City of Atlanta v. Warnock, 18\n\nS.E. 135, 135 (Ga. 1892) (holding that if municipality goes beyond\n\nauthority and injures private property by the opening of manholes and\n\nreleasing poisonous gases, it is responsible for resulting damage); Gage v.\n\nCity of Chicago, 60 N.E. 896, 897 (Ill. 1901) (holding that an ordinance\n\nwhich resulted in preventing the connection of sewer systems was void\n\nbecause the city had “no right to empty the sewage upon private\n\nproperty”); State v. Concordia, 96 P. 487, 489–90 (Kan. 1908) (holding a\n\ncity could be liable for polluting a river and damaging private\n\nlandowners, even though a statute authorized the city to dump sewage\n\f                                     60\n\ninto the river); Thompson v. City of Winona, 51 So. 129, 129 (Miss. 1910)\n\n(holding a city liable for damages when it constructed a sewer system\n\nwhich polluted a waterway and damaged the plaintiff); Smith v. City of\n\nSedalia, 53 S.W. 907, 912 (Mo. 1899) (holding a city could be liable for\n\npolluting a stream flowing into plaintiff’s farm, despite city establishing\n\nsewer system under legislative mandate); Markwardt v. City of Guthrie,\n\n90 P. 26, 28–29 (Okla. 1907) (holding that a lower property owner has a\n\ncause of action, including injunctive relief, against a city for polluting a\n\nstream); Pearce v. Gibson County, 64 S.W. 33, 36 (Tenn. 1901) (issuing\n\nan injunction prohibiting a municipality from emptying sewage from a\n\ncourthouse upon the land of the complainant).\n\n      The pollution cases distinguished in Maben were consistent with\n\ncontemporary Iowa law.      In Vogt v. City of Grinnell, we considered an\n\naction brought against a city for discharging sewage into the stream to\n\nthe material injury of lower riparian owners.      133 Iowa 363, 364, 110\n\nN.W. 603, 603 (1907).     We noted that a statute authorized the city to\n\nconstruct a system of sewers but did not authorize emptying the sewers\n\ninto a running stream even if the system was functioning as designed.\n\nId. at 365, 110 N.W. at 603. The sewer system was operating perfectly in\n\nVogt, but the unauthorized discharge of sewage to the material injury of\n\nriparian proprietors was a wrongful act.      Id.; see also Boyd v. City of\n\nOskaloosa, 179 Iowa 387, 390, 161 N.W. 491, 492 (1917).\n\n      We considered a later overflow case in Miller v. Monona County,\n\n229 Iowa 165, 294 N.W. 308 (1940).         In Monona County, the plaintiff\n\nsought a mandatory injunction to abate nuisances caused by water\n\noverflow as a result of dust storms and vegetation filling the ditches of\n\nthe drainage district. Id. at 168, 294 N.W. at 310. In Monona County we\n\nstated, “The drainage district is a special creation of the legislature and it\n\f                                     61\n\nrequires no argument to sustain the proposition that it cannot create a\n\nnuisance while operating within the ambit of power constitutionally\n\ndelegated.” Id. at 169, 294 N.W. at 311.\n\n      Whenever a court says that no argument is necessary to sustain a\n\nproposition, we should be especially alert for potential error.       Like\n\nMaben, Monona County, however, was not a pollution case.           It was\n\nanother overflow case.     The Monona County court had no interest in\n\nthrusting overflow liability onto drainage districts, even if the overflow\n\nwas a result of a failure to repair drainage districts. See id.\n\n      D. Compliance with Internal Duties Arising from Iowa Code\n\nChapter 468. There are a number of cases where plaintiffs have sought\n\nto require drainage districts to comply with statutory duties arising from\n\nIowa Code chapter 468. For instance, as described earlier, we heard a\n\ncase where plaintiffs sought to require the board of supervisors to repair\n\na drainage ditch, which was obstructed and in poor repair. Wise, 242\n\nIowa at 871–72, 48 N.W.2d at 248.          Originally, the board began the\n\nproject, but abandoned it when other landowners in the district objected\n\nto the expense. Id. at 872, 48 N.W.2d at 248.\n\n      In Wise, we held that it was clear under the record that “repairs\n\nare necessary to make the drainage improvement function properly.” Id.\n\nat 874, 48 N.W.2d at 249. We granted mandamus to order the board to\n\nmake the improvements. Id. at 875, 48 N.W.2d at 249. Mandamus is an\n\nappropriate remedy to compel drainage districts to perform a legal duty\n\nunder Wise. Additionally, in Voogd, we granted an injunction against a\n\ndrainage district to prevent the collection of future assessments to pay\n\nfor a drainage district improvement. 188 N.W.2d at 395.\n\n      The availability of mandamus to require a drainage district to\n\nperform needed repairs was also discussed in Chicago Central, which was\n\f                                    62\n\ndescribed above. 816 N.W.2d at 373–74. We held that money damages\n\nwere not available, but we declared that the railroad could have filed a\n\nmandamus action to compel the district to make the repair. Id. at 378.\n\n      E. Compliance with External Statutory Duties Arising Outside\n\nChapter 468: Defeat of the Impenetrable Legal Bubble Theory. We\n\nhave, on occasion, considered the interplay between Iowa Code chapter\n\n468 and other statutes. The cases demonstrate that drainage districts\n\nare not hermetically sealed in an impenetrable legal bubble from other\n\nrequirements of the Code.\n\n      In Iowa Employment Security, the Iowa Employment Security\n\nCommission assessed and levied taxes and interest claimed due from a\n\ndrainage district under Iowa Code chapters 97B and 97C. 260 Iowa at\n\n342, 149 N.W.2d at 289. There was no statutory provision in Iowa Code\n\nchapter 468 authorizing the drainage district to pay these taxes. Id. at\n\n343–44, 149 N.W.2d at 289–90.            The Iowa Employment Security\n\nCommission, however, sought to compel the drainage district to “perform\n\nasserted statutory duties.” Id. at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291. We agreed\n\nwith the commission and held that the provisions of Iowa Code chapter\n\n97B and 97C could be enforced and that mandamus against the\n\ndrainage district was “the proper remedy.” Id. Thus, equitable remedies\n\nare available to enforce against drainage districts duties that arise from\n\nstatutory provisions outside Iowa Code chapter 468.\n\n      There is one other case of interest. In Polk County Drainage District\n\nFour v. Iowa Natural Resources Council, we considered whether a\n\ndrainage   district   had   complete     authority   over   construction   of\n\nimprovements under chapter 468 or whether the Iowa Natural Resources\n\nCouncil (INRC) had the power to approve or deny permits for such\n\nconstruction under Iowa Code chapter 455A. 377 N.W.2d 236, 239–40\n\f                                         63\n\n(Iowa 1985). We held that the INRC had concurrent authority over such\n\nconstruction. Id. at 241. We emphasized that when two statutes deal\n\nwith the same subject, courts endeavor to give effect to both enactments.\n\nId.    While drainage district statutes were to be liberally construed,\n\naccording to the Polk County court, environmental policy statutes were\n\nalso   to   be   liberally   construed   because    of   the   important   policy\n\nconsiderations underlying them.           Id.   Polk County stands for the\n\nproposition that claims of exclusive authority by drainage districts must\n\ngive way to an environmental policy statute governing the same subject\n\nmatter.\n\n       F. No Money Damages for Torts. As can be seen above, we have,\n\nin a number of cases, refused to allow an award of money damages\n\nagainst a drainage district. But our statements in that regard have been\n\nsometimes limited. For example, in Fisher, we considered a case where\n\nplaintiffs experienced flooding problems because of the operation of a\n\ndrainage district.     369 N.W.2d at 427.          On the question of money\n\ndamages, we offered the limited observation that drainage districts have\n\nno corporate existence “for that purpose.” Id. at 429. We also offered the\n\nbroad characterization that the unavailability of money damages against\n\na drainage district amounted to “immunity from suit in tort.” Id. at 430.\n\n       The next case of interest is Gard, 521 N.W.2d at 696. In Gard, we\n\nrejected a claim for money damages by the estate of drowned boaters. Id.\n\nat 699. We cited Fischer for the proposition that drainage districts have\n\nlimited powers. Id. at 698. We emphasized the narrow proposition that\n\n“Iowa has never allowed tort claims for money damages to be made\n\nagainst a drainage district.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n       We made a similar declaration in Chicago Central. Although it was\n\nin the context of reimbursement for a repair, we restated that although\n\f                                   64\n\nmandamus was available to cause a drainage district to do its duty,\n\nmoney damages were not an available remedy.          Chicago Cent., 816\n\nN.W.2d at 378.\n\n      G. Silence! Post Home Rule Cases.        Finally, there is one more\n\nobservation that must be made regarding our drainage district caselaw.\n\nNo-money-damages cases like Fisher and Gard emphasize the limited\n\nnature of drainage district authority.   See Gard, 521 N.W.2d at 698;\n\nFisher, 369 N.W.2d at 429. Yet, in 1978, Iowa passed an amendment to\n\nthe Iowa Constitution establishing county home rule. Iowa Const. art.\n\nIII, § 39A. Under county home rule, the so-called Dillon rule is abolished\n\nand local governments have broadened powers.           Polk Cty. Bd. of\n\nSupervisors v. Polk Commonwealth Charter Comm’n, 522 N.W.2d 783,\n\n790–91 (Iowa 1994).      While several of our drainage district cases\n\noccurred after the enactment of the county home rule amendment, none\n\nof them consider the impact of home rule on our cases. In this case,\n\nDMWW claims that Fisher and Gard are no longer viable authority\n\nbecause the power of drainage districts is no longer limited as it was\n\nprior to county home rule.\n\n      IV. Potential Remedies Against Drainage Districts.\n\n      A. Introduction. It seems to me that much of the rhetoric of our\n\ndrainage district cases is not entirely accurate. The notion that drainage\n\ndistricts are not entities strikes me as simply wrong. Further, although\n\nwe declare that drainage districts have “immunity” from money damages,\n\nI am not sure that is an accurate description of what our caselaw in fact\n\nsupports.   I do not see in our cases a legislative or judicial policy\n\njudgment that drainage districts should be generally immune from\n\npotential damages in tort.\n\f                                    65\n\n      Instead, I conclude that the real issue at stake here is not whether\n\nwe should abandon the wrong-headed notion that drainage districts are\n\nnot entities or whether we should abrogate some kind of immunity based\n\nupon some perception of public policy. The real question relates to the\n\nability, or lack of ability, of a drainage district to comply with a court-\n\nordered damage or injunctive remedy related to pollution. I am inclined\n\nto agree with the drainage district that an injunction against a state\n\nofficial “is utterly meaningless” when the official against whom the\n\ninjunction is granted lacks the power to redress the associated injuries.\n\nOkpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405, 426–27 (5th Cir. 2001). In short, the\n\nremedies questions posed in this case are about whether the defendants\n\nhave the authority to comply with a potential judgment for money\n\ndamages or an injunction fashioned to abate a nuisance should the\n\nDMWW prevail on its substantive nuisance claims. These are questions\n\nof law, not fact.\n\n      B. Money Damages and Application of Stare Decisis.\n\n      1. Introduction.   On the issue of money damages, the drainage\n\ndistrict defendants argue that we are bound by stare decisis to follow our\n\nprecedents.    As shown above, in several contexts, our cases proclaim\n\nthat money damages in tort are not available against drainage districts,\n\nmost persuasively because of their limited statutory powers.\n\n      DMWW draws our attention to three potential problems.          First,\n\nDMWW attacks the general reasoning employed in our no-money-\n\ndamages cases and invites us to abandon them as a relic of the past.\n\nSecond, DMWW points out that our no-money-damages cases do not\n\ninvolve cases concerning pollution or, more narrowly, pollution allegedly\n\narising in violation of statutory nuisance. Third, DMWW challenges the\n\nreasoning of our cases refusing to allow money damages.            Finally,\n\f                                     66\n\nDMWW contends that even if our cases might be otherwise entitled to\n\nstare decisis, the enactment of county home rule in 1978 deprives these\n\ncases of their precedential value.\n\n      2. Rationale of no-money-damages cases. To some extent, I agree\n\nwith DMWW that some of the reasoning employed in our no-money-\n\ndamages caselaw is flawed. As indicated above, I do not accept the no-\n\nlegal-entity line of reasoning or the characterization of nonliability as\n\nbased on immunity. What I do think is at play in our cases, however, is\n\nthe notion that drainage districts have limited statutory powers and that\n\nthese powers do not include the ability to pay money damages.\n\nCertainly, as the drainage district defendants point out, DMWW has been\n\nunable to point to any statutory provision in the more than six hundred\n\nsections of Iowa Code chapter 468 that expressly authorizes payment of\n\nmoney damages.\n\n      We have long held, even in the pre-home rule days, that local\n\ngovernment authority includes not only what is expressed but also what\n\nis necessarily implied.   See, e.g., Woodbury County v. Anderson, 164\n\nN.W.2d 129, 134 (Iowa 1969); In re Estate of Frentress, 249 Iowa 783,\n\n786, 89 N.W.2d 367, 368 (1958). There is, perhaps, an argument that\n\nthe power to pay for money damages should be necessarily implied from\n\nchapter 468, but I do not find such an implication compelling. At the\n\ntime chapter 468 was enacted, sovereign immunity was the rule and not\n\nthe exception. I doubt that the legislature intended when it granted the\n\ndrainage districts limited express powers to imply a power that under\n\nprevailing law was not generally available absent legislative consent. I\n\nthus conclude that the argument that drainage districts have an implied\n\npower to pay money damages does not have much merit.\n\f                                       67\n\n        3. Broad case holdings and stare decisis.       The next question I\n\nconsider is whether the cases that might be entitled to stare decisis cover\n\nthe present controversy. DMWW is correct that cases like Fisher, Gard,\n\nand Chicago Central do not involve pollution matters. And, in particular,\n\nthey do not arise in the context of claimed violation of duties arising out\n\nof other statutes such as statutory nuisance. Iowa Code § 657.2(4). Yet,\n\nthe language of the cases is quite broad—“Iowa has never allowed tort\n\nclaims for money damages to be made against a drainage district”! Gard,\n\n521 N.W.2d at 698.\n\n        The question is whether prior broad statements of law are entitled\n\nto stare decisis even when the facts of a subsequent case are arguably\n\ndistinguishable. See, e.g., Indep. Inst. v. FEC, 816 F.3d 113, 117 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2016) (“The nature of our system of legal precedent is that later\n\ncases    often   distinguish   prior   cases   based   on   sometimes   slight\n\ndifferences.”); Richard M. Re, Narrowing Supreme Court Precedent from\n\nBelow, 104 Geo. L.J. 921, 924–25 (2016) (describing how lower federal\n\ncourts will often “narrow from below” outdated or ambiguous Supreme\n\nCourt precedents); Richard M. Re, Narrowing Precedent in the Supreme\n\nCourt, 114 Colum. L. Rev. 1861, 1875–89 (2014) (arguing that healthy\n\nstare decisis can require methods of narrowing broadly stated precedent\n\nin order to avoid overruling a case when its “best reading,” i.e. the\n\nprecedent as actually stated, would require an outcome inconsistent with\n\nother legal principles). Of course, the next case is always different, in\n\nsome way, from prior cases. But at the same time, context matters. The\n\nquestion is whether a broad legal expression is binding in the contexts\n\nother than that in which it has arisen? Here, unlike in Fisher, Gard, and\n\nChicago Central, a statute outside of Iowa Code chapter 468 imposes a\n\f                                    68\n\nduty not to create or continue a nuisance—no similar statutory duties\n\nwere present in the cases disallowing money damages.\n\n      I do not have a very clear answer for this interesting question.\n\nThere is considerable appeal to the argument that broad statements of\n\nlaw are binding only in the factual setting from which they arise and are\n\nreally only dicta with respect to other claims. The law constantly evolves\n\nby distinguishing past precedent based on factual differences.       As is\n\napparent from this opinion, I regard many of the issues posed in this\n\ncase as abundantly nuanced and contextual. Certainly we can all agree\n\nthat we have never considered the potential liability of drainage districts\n\nin the context of a claim that the operation causes violation of federal\n\npollution law.\n\n      We should be particularly alert to avoid masking preferred policy\n\nchoices in a stare decisis costume. And, an overburdened court may be\n\ntempted to over read precedent in the name of efficiency and quick\n\nresults, but such an approach runs the risk of uncritical dispositions.\n\n      Yet, notions of nuance and context could be extended so far that\n\nthere would almost never be an occasion to apply stare decisis and\n\nliterally nothing would ever be settled in the law.    In close cases, the\n\ndetermination of whether to apply stare decisis is a matter of judgment,\n\nnot inexorable command.\n\n      It seems to me that one relevant line of inquiry is whether a\n\nreasonable drainage district would rely on the statements in our caselaw\n\nas binding in the structuring of its financial and business affairs. In our\n\ncases, particularly Gard and Chicago Central, the statements about\n\nmoney damages are emphatic and were made in contexts where the\n\nplaintiffs’ claims had considerable equitable appeal.       Yet, in Iowa\n\nEmployment Security, the drainage district was required to pay money—\n\f                                          69\n\nnot damages in tort, perhaps, but money nonetheless—to a government\n\nagency based on statutory requirements outside of Iowa Code chapter\n\n468. See 260 Iowa at 346–47, 149 N.W.2d at 291. And, in Polk County,\n\nwe recognized that environmental regulations would be enforced in the\n\nface of a claim that drainage districts had exclusive jurisdiction for\n\nmatters within the scope of its authority. See 377 N.W.2d at 241. Yet,\n\nthe issue here is not regulatory enforcement, as in Polk County, or\n\npayment of money to government entity, as required in Iowa Employment\n\nSecurity, but a question of money damages for an alleged civil wrong.\n\n       Although a close question, I am inclined to go along with the\n\napplication of stare decisis on the question of the availability of money\n\ndamages in this case.          The most valid rationale for the no-money-\n\ndamages approach—that a drainage district has limited powers—is a\n\nbroad proposition that applies across the board. 16 Further, it seems to\n\nme that a reasonable drainage district might forgo the possibility of\n\ninsurance in light of our caselaw. See, e.g., State v. Peeler, 140 A.3d 811,\n\n857 (Conn. 2016) (Zarella, J., dissenting) (noting, among other costs to\n\nindividuals of overturning precedent, the impact on risk-shifting\n\narrangements like insurance policies); Crist v. Hunan Palace, Inc., 89\nP.3d 573, 580 (Kan. 2004) (declining to overrule precedent in part\n\nbecause insureds and insurance companies had relied on the precedent\n\nin purchasing and crafting insurance policies); Paige v. City of Sterling\n\nHeights, 720 N.W.2d 219, 228–29 (Mich. 2006) (overruling a prior\n\n\n       16Admittedly, though, this notion is clouded by Iowa Employment Security,\n\nwhere the drainage district was required to pay funds to the state to support retirement\neven though there was no express statutory authority to do so. See 260 Iowa at 346–\n47, 149 N.W.2d at 291. The power to pay for statutorily required retirement benefits\ncould only have been an implied power. I have, however, rejected the notion of an\nimplied power to pay money damages for torts.\n\f                                     70\n\ndecision because, in part, the precedent did not cause large numbers of\n\npeople to attempt to conform their conduct to the decision by, for\n\nexample, deciding whether to purchase insurance or not).         Further,\n\nwhere the result of precedent is defensible and the legislature has had a\n\nrelatively recent reminder in Chicago Central four years ago, we should\n\nbe cautious to reexamine precedent. See Doe v. New London Cmty. Sch.\n\nDist., 848 N.W.2d 347, 355 (Iowa 2014); Ackelson v. Manley Toy Direct,\n\nL.L.C., 832 N.W.2d 678, 688 (Iowa 2013).         So, although I am not\n\ncompletely confident in the result, I am inclined to conclude that stare\n\ndecisis precludes our reconsideration of our caselaw that generally\n\nstands for the proposition that money damages are not an available\n\nremedy against drainage districts.\n\n      4. Impact of county home rule amendment. DMWW argues that our\n\nprior precedent is based on perceived limitations in the statutory\n\nauthority of drainage districts. DMWW asserts that this rationale is no\n\nlonger applicable in light of the enactment of the county home rule\n\namendment to the Iowa Constitution.       Under the county home rule\n\namendment, counties are no longer subject to the Dillon rule, which\n\nstated that local governments only have those powers expressly granted\n\nor necessarily applied or necessarily implied.   See Iowa Const. art. III,\n\n§ 39A; cf. City of Des Moines v. Master Builders of Iowa, 498 N.W.2d 702,\n\n703 (Iowa 1993) (en banc) (considering the home rule amendment as\n\napplied to city government). DMWW argues that drainage districts, as\n\nsubdivisions of the county, now have larger powers, including the power\n\nto pay money damages for environmental pollution.       DMWW correctly\n\nasserts that our post-county home rule cases, Fisher, Gard, and Chicago\n\nCentral, do not address the question of whether home rule impacts the\n\nno-money-damages rule.\n\f                                     71\n\n      The majority indicates that even if they have the benefit of home\n\nrule, the drainage districts do not have the power to tax beyond that\n\nauthorized by the general assembly.       That is, of course, an accurate\n\nproposition.   Yet, the Iowa Constitution expressly vests authority in\n\ndrainage districts to impose special assessments.       Iowa Const. art. I,\n\n§ 18. Further, we have held that special assessments do not necessarily\n\namount to a tax. Bennett v. Greenwalt, 226 Iowa 1113, 1134, 286 N.W.\n\n722, 732 (1939).    Thus, the relevant question is whether a drainage\n\ndistrict may use its expressly authorized special assessment power to\n\npay money damages arising from pollution. I am not sure of the answer\n\nto this question if home rule applies to drainage districts.\n\n      But, I doubt that county home rule applies to drainage districts.\n\nThe county home rule amendment applies only to “counties” or “joint\n\ncounty-municipal corporations.”       A county, however, has not been\n\nnamed as a defendant in this litigation.           Although constitutional\n\nlanguage is often open textured and our interpretation must show fidelity\n\nto the underlying constitutional values animating the language, a\n\ndrainage district is not the same as a county, but instead is a\n\ngovernmental subdivision of the county in which they are located. Iowa\n\nEmployment Security, 260 Iowa at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291. The question\n\nis thus whether the unquestionably broad home rule of a county is\n\nvicariously passed on to a subdivision of the county.\n\n      It is my conclusion that drainage districts do not come within the\n\nscope of the county home rule amendment.            The county home rule\n\namendment was directed to county and county-municipal corporations\n\nthat exercise general police powers and not to tightly regulated, limited\n\npurpose entities like a drainage district whose governing structure, to\n\nsome extent, merely overlaps with county government. See Fountain City\n\f                                    72\n\nSanitary Dist. v. Knox Cty. Election Comm’n, 308 S.W.2d 482, 486 (Tenn.\n\n1957) (Swepston, J., concurring) (explaining that drainage districts, as\n\nquasi-municipal corporations, were not intended to be included within\n\nthe ambit of the home rule amendment); Union High Sch. Dist. No. 1 v.\n\nTaxpayers of Union High Sch. Dist. No. 1, 172 P.2d 591, 596 (Wash. 1946)\n\n(holding that a municipal corporation, in this case a high school district,\n\nwas not granted powers of home rule unless the statutory language\n\ncreating the municipal corporation clearly showed the legislature’s intent\n\nto grant home rule powers); see also Philip A. Trautman, Legislative\n\nControl of Municipal Corporations in Washington, 38 Wash. L. Rev. 743,\n\n745 (1963).\n\n      C. State Constitutional Challenges to “Immunity” for Money\n\nDamages Based on Due Process, Equal Protection, and Inalienable\n\nRights.     Assuming as a matter of law that money damages are not\n\navailable, DMWW raises due process, equal protection, and inalienable\n\nrights arguments under the Iowa Constitution challenging this state of\n\naffairs. DMWW asserts that the judicially created doctrine of immunity\n\nfrom money damages simply has to be abandoned. DMWW claims that\n\nIowa constitutional infirmities arise from such an irrational and arbitrary\n\nstate of affairs when most governmental entities are liable for such\n\nmoney damages but drainage districts are not.\n\n      DMWW argues by analogy based on our decisions in cases\n\nincluding Miller v. Boone County Hospital, 394 N.W.2d 776 (Iowa 1986),\n\nGacke, 684 N.W.2d at 168, and Hensler v. City of Davenport, 790 N.W.2d\n\n569 (Iowa 2010).    In Miller, we struck down a statute imposing more\n\nstringent   procedural   requirements    on   tort   claims   against   local\n\ngovernments on equal protection grounds.         394 N.W.2d at 781.       In\n\nGacke, we held that an immunity provision in Iowa Code section\n\f                                    73\n\n657.11(2) exempting certain livestock operators from nuisance claims\n\namounted to a per se taking under the Iowa Constitution. 684 N.W.2d at\n\n174–75.   In Hensler, we developed a two-step process for determining\n\nwhether a particular state action violates substantive due process,\n\nincluding a determination of whether a right is fundamental which,\n\nDMWW asserts, certainly includes its right to compensation for\n\nenvironmental harms. See 790 N.W.2d at 580–81. DMWW maintains\n\nthat if, in fact, drainage districts are immune from nuisance damages,\n\nsuch immunity is constitutionally infirm under the equal protection, due\n\nprocess, and inalienable rights clauses of the Iowa Constitution as\n\napplied in Miller, Gacke, and Hensler.\n\n      If the plaintiff in this case was a citizen as in Miller, Gacke, and\n\nHensler, DMWW’s argument would need to be confronted. But this case\n\ninvolves a government subdivision suing another government subdivision\n\nfor alleged damages from environmental harm.         While our cases on\n\ndrainage districts use the term “immunity,” which inevitably gives rise to\n\nthe comparison with Gacke, the comparison is flawed. While the cases\n\nare sometimes couched in immunity language, the use of the term\n\n“immunity” is inaccurate. The real issue, to me, is a limitation of the\n\npower of drainage districts compared to other entities.\n\n      Where the crux of the constitutional issue is the constitutional\n\nvalidity of a limitation on the power of a government subdivision, our\n\ncaselaw suggests that another government subdivision does not have the\n\npower to bring these claims. See Bd. of Supervisors v. Dep’t of Revenue,\n\n263 N.W.2d 227, 232 (Iowa 1978). If a government subdivision cannot\n\ncomplain of any act of the legislature diminishing its revenue, amending\n\nits charter, or even dissolving it, it may be argued that DMWW as a\n\nlegislative creature cannot attack the limitations of power of another\n\f                                       74\n\nlegislative creature, the drainage district, absent a clear constitutional\n\ncommand to the contrary. See McSurely v. McGrew, 140 Iowa 163, 170,\n\n118 N.W. 415, 418–19 (Iowa 1908).\n\n      On this very narrow point, I concur with the result of the majority\n\nwith respect to the equal protection, due process, and inalienable rights\n\nclaims attacking the lack of authority of the drainage district defendants\n\nto pay money damages for common law or statutory torts.                   I do not,\n\nhowever, opine more generally on standing issues involving government\n\nsubdivisions as plaintiffs.     In particular, as will be explained below, I\n\nconclude that DMWW may raise a takings claim under article I, section\n\n18 of the Iowa Constitution against the drainage district defendants.\n\n      D. Equitable Relief to Abate Nuisance.\n\n      1. Introduction.    The question of whether equitable remedies are\n\navailable to abate an alleged nuisance caused by drainage districts raises\n\na fundamentally different question than the money damages controversy.\n\nIn order to address this different question, I first consider whether\n\ninjunctive relief is available against drainage districts generally. I then\n\nturn to the question of whether nuisance provides a substantive legal\n\nbasis for an injunction in a pollution context generally. Next, I consider\n\nwhether an injunction to abate a nuisance arising from alleged pollution\n\nmay be entered against drainage districts. Finally, I consider the merits\n\nof DMWW’s contention that it is entitled to seek injunctive relief if it can\n\nprove its nuisance case under the facts presented to us by the certifying\n\nfederal court in this case.\n\n      2. Availability    of   injunctive    relief   against   drainage    districts\n\ngenerally.   The question here is whether injunctive relief is part of a\n\njudicial tool kit that might be available to the district court in the event\n\nthat DMWW demonstrates an entitlement to relief. The mere fact that\n\f                                      75\n\nmoney damages are not available, even if based on immunity, does not\n\nprevent the availability of equitable relief.    While our cases repeatedly\n\nassert that money damages are not available, our cases clearly state that\n\nequitable relief is available against drainage districts. For example, we\n\nhave said the equitable remedy of mandamus is available to order\n\nmembers of the board of supervisors to ensure that the drainage district\n\nmeets a mandatory legal duty. Wise, 242 Iowa at 874, 48 N.W.2d at 249.\n\nWe have said that injunctive relief is available to order a drainage district\n\nto repay money assessed pursuant to a void repair contract. Voogd, 188\n\nN.W.2d at 393.\n\n      I am not sure the fine distinction between mandamus and\n\ninjunction matters much.      We have said that mandamus would lie to\n\ncompel a city to abate a continuing public nuisance where it was under a\n\nduty to abate the nuisance. Cowin v. City of Waterloo, 237 Iowa 202,\n\n212–13, 21 N.W.2d 705, 710 (1946).         In Wise, mandamus was issued\n\nwhen there was a clear duty, yet no detailed instructions regarding how\n\nthe district could meet that duty. 242 Iowa at 874, 48 N.W.2d at 249.\n\nWhether or not DMWW can make the case for a Wise-type remedy is of\n\ncourse not clear at this early point in the litigation.\n\n      And, it seems to me that injunctive relief in a proper case should\n\nbe available, too.    The value of injunctive relief is that it allows the\n\ndistrict court to shape the remedy to meet the contours of the problem.\n\nSee Brown v. Voss, 715 P.2d 514, 517 (Wash. 1986) (en banc) (noting\n\nthat a district court has broad discretionary power to shape injunctive\n\nrelief to the particular facts, circumstances, and equities of the case);\n\naccord N. Star State Bank of Roseville v. N. Star Bank Minn., 361 N.W.2d\n\n889, 895 (Minn. Ct. App. 1985); Reprod. Health Servs., Inc. v. Lee, 660\n\nS.W.2d 330, 335 (Mo. Ct. App. 1983); Rhett v. Gray, 736 S.E.2d 873, 882\n\f                                      76\n\n(S.C. Ct. App. 2012). In modern law, injunctions are available to meet a\n\nwide variety of problems. See Stephens v. Borgman, 210 P.2d 176, 183\n\n(Okla. 1949) (Davison, C.J., dissenting) (asserting that, while injunctive\n\nrelief was originally used sparingly by courts of equity, the modern\n\ntendency is to grant injunctions when a clear showing is made of a\n\ncontinuing or likely to be repeated wrong); Pearce v. Pearce, 226 P.2d\n\n895, 897 (Wash. 1951) (“We recognize and approve the modern tendency\n\nto protect personal rights by injunctive relief where there is no adequate\n\nremedy at law.”). I do not see a reason why the remedy should not be\n\navailable if DMWW makes the appropriate legal and factual showing\n\nsupporting its claim.\n\n      The drainage districts suggest that because the development of\n\ndrainage infrastructure is authorized by law, it cannot be a nuisance.\n\nThe law is otherwise.      McQuillan instructs us, for instance, that a\n\nmunicipality   cannot    escape   liability   because   a   construction   was\n\nauthorized by statute.     18 Eugene McQuillan, The Law of Municipal\n\nCorporations § 53:77.24, at 624–25 (3d ed. 2013) [hereinafter McQuillan].\n\nThere is ample authority for this proposition.          We said as much in\n\nKriener, 212 N.W.2d at 530, 535 (canvassing Iowa law and holding the\n\nexistence of nuisance not affected by lawfulness of an offending\n\nestablishment). There is also ample authority from other jurisdictions.\n\nSee, e.g., Friends of H St. v. City of Sacramento, 24 Cal. Rptr. 2d 607, 611\n\n(Ct. App. 1993); Delta Air Corp. v. Kersey, 20 S.E.2d 245, 250 (Ga. 1942);\n\nWebb v. Town of Rye, 230 A.2d 223, 226 (N.H. 1967).              Ordinarily, a\n\nmunicipality is liable for maintaining or contributing to a nuisance to the\n\nsame extent as an individual. Miller v. Town of Ankeny, 253 Iowa 1055,\n\n1061, 114 N.W.2d 910, 914 (1962) (upholding instruction that would\n\nallow town to be held liable for improper construction and operation of a\n\f                                    77\n\nsewage treatment plant resulting in a nuisance); McQuillan § 53:77.24,\n\nat 627–28 & n.11.\n\n      3. Nuisance as basis for equitable relief to abate pollution generally.\n\nI now examine the underlying substantive basis of DMWW’s claim for the\n\nremedy of an injunction. DMWW claims that Iowa nuisance law provides\n\na basis for equitable relief.\n\n      We recently canvassed the application of nuisance law to\n\nenvironmental matters in Freeman, 848 N.W.2d at 66–69. As we noted\n\nin Freeman, common law nuisance theory has provided a remedy for\n\nenvironmental wrongs reaching back into the seventeenth century. Id. at\n\n66.   We noted in Freeman the availability of nuisance to address\n\nenvironmental harms was endorsed by the Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts, which included sections on both public and private nuisance. Id.;\n\nsee Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 821B–821E, at 87–104 (1979). We\n\nquoted a leading commentator who noted that nuisance “continues to be\n\nthe fulcrum of what is called today environmental law.” Freeman, 848\n\nN.W.2d at 66–67 (quoting 1 William H. Rodgers, Jr., Environmental Law:\n\nAir and Water § 2.1, at 29 (1986)). We noted in Freeman that nuisance\n\ntheory had been recognized in Iowa for decades in the environmental\n\ncontexts. Id. at 67; see also Kriener, 212 N.W.2d at 536 (finding noxious\n\nodor from sewage facility amounted to a private nuisance); Ryan v. City of\n\nEmmetsburg, 232 Iowa 600, 603, 4 N.W.2d 435, 438 (1942) (concerning a\n\nprivate nuisance arising from sewer system).\n\n      We further recognized in Freeman that the Iowa legislature\n\nexplicitly endorsed nuisance theory by enacting a statutory nuisance\n\naction in Iowa Code section 657.1.        848 N.W.2d at 67.        We have\n\nconsistently held that the statutory nuisance provisions do not preempt\n\ncommon law nuisance claims but supplement them. Id.\n\f                                     78\n\n      In Freeman, we recognized the modern trend to control the\n\nenvironment through the enactment of regulatory statutory regimes. Id.\n\nat 68–69.   We pointed out in Freeman, however, that the purpose of\n\nregulatory statutory environmental regimes was to protect the public\n\ngenerally and not to provide a remedy for special harms to property at a\n\nspecific location.   Id. at 69.    As a result, we held that applicable\n\nprovisions of the Clean Air Act did not preempt state common law\n\nnuisance claims. Id. at 84–85.\n\n      Freeman involved a case of air pollution, not water pollution. But,\n\nunder a Freeman-type analysis, nuisance theory provides a potential\n\nbasis for an injunction in cases involving water pollution that has not\n\nbeen preempted by state or federal statutes dealing with water pollution.\n\n      4. Appropriateness of nuisance remedy against drainage districts.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, the process of adjudication of nuisance\n\nclaims—with the rules of evidence, the orderly development of a record,\n\nthorough consideration by a fair and impartial trial judge, and the\n\npossibility of appeal to a dispassionate appellate court—has many\n\nattractive qualities. Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving causation, and\n\nthe degree of harm is based in fact, not supposition.         Remedies are\n\nspecifically sculpted to meet the factual showing of the plaintiffs.\n\n      The case-by-case nuisance approach is consistent with what is\n\nknown in environmental law as the PPP, or the “polluter pays principle.”\n\nThe PPP principle is recognized as a norm in international environmental\n\nlaw and, according to one commentator, should apply when agricultural\n\nactivities impose environmental harm that affects private and public\n\nproperty.   See Margaret Rosso Grossman, Agriculture and the Polluter\n\nPays Principle: An Introduction, 59 Okla. L. Rev. 1, 3 (2006); Boris N.\n\nMamlyuk, Analyzing the Polluter Pays Principle Through Law and\n\f                                          79\n\nEconomics, 18 Se. Envtl. L.J. 39, 42 (2009); Ved P. Nanda, Agriculture\n\nand the Polluter Pays Principle, 54 Am. J. Comp. L. 317, 319–20 (2006).\n\n      The majority suggests that solutions to water quality are better\n\nadvanced by the “elected branches of government who are responsible to\n\nthe people.”       The majority ignores the fact that the legislature has\n\nenacted a nuisance statute that DMWW seeks to enforce. See Iowa Code\n\nch. 657.     The Iowa legislature, unlike the majority, has thus generally\n\nendorsed nuisance as a means of environmental protection.                      It has\n\nprovided a specific statutory mechanism for abatement of nuisances and\n\npayment of expenses associated with abatement. See Iowa Code § 657.7.\n\nThe legislature added an exclamation point by making the creation or\n\ncontinuing of a nuisance a criminal offense. See id. § 657.3.\n\n      And, tellingly, the legislature crafted a narrow exception to Iowa\n\nCode chapter 657 for certain animal feeding operations. 17                            Id.\n\n§ 657.11(2). That is the only exception in chapter 657. The legislature\n\nthus contemplated who might be exempt from nuisance requirements\n\ngenerally.     It did not exempt drainage districts.         See Reyes-Fuentes v.\n\nShannon Produce Farm, Inc., 671 F. Supp. 2d 1365, 1369 (S.D. Ga. 2009)\n\n(finding that the expression of one exception in a statute implies the\nexclusion of other exceptions); accord Pugliese v. Pukka Dev., Inc., 550\n\nF.3d 1299, 1304 (11th Cir. 2008); Winkle v. State, 841 S.W.2d 589, 591\n\n(Ark. 1992); In re Cadwell’s Estate, 186 P. 499, 501 (Wyo. 1920).\n\n      5. Relevant drainage district caselaw regarding nuisance claims.\n\nDMWW seeks relief in this case under both common law and statutory\n\nnuisance theories. As indicated above, there is nothing in our caselaw\n\nsuggesting that equitable remedies are not available to abate pollution\n\n      17This   provision was declared unconstitutional in Gacke, 684 N.W.2d at 179.\n\f                                      80\n\nallegedly caused by drainage districts. In Vogt, we allowed a damages\n\nremedy in a case brought against a city for discharging sewage into the\n\nstream to the material injury of lower riparian owners. 133 Iowa at 363,\n\n110 N.W. at 603–04. Nothing in the case indicated equitable relief was\n\nnot available for this type of harm.        While we denied an injunction\n\nagainst a drainage district in Maben, we took great pains to distinguish\n\noverflow from environmental nuisances. 187 Iowa at 1068, 175 N.W. at\n\n515–16. Finally, we granted an injunction against a drainage district in\n\nVoogd to prohibit the collection of additional installment payments. 188\n\nN.W.2d at 395.\n\n      Further, we have held in several cases that equitable remedies are\n\navailable against the management of a drainage district to force\n\ncompliance with the law.         To me, in addition to cases like Iowa\n\nEmployment Security, these cases are the death knell of the no-legal-\n\nentity approach in other cases, an obvious proposition not recognized by\n\nthe majority. And, if mandamus is available in an appropriate case, as\n\nour cases clearly establish, why would injunctive relief not be available in\n\nan appropriate case, as it was in Voogd?\n\n      Thus, unlike on the question of money damages, our cases do not\n\nuniformly and clearly hold that injunctive relief is not available in the\n\ncontext of a pollution case.     Indeed, if anything, they suggest that an\n\ninjunction might be available in proper circumstances.          Our cases are\n\nplainly not entitled to stare decisis on the question of availability of an\n\ninjunction to abate a nuisance because there has been no clear and\n\ndefinitive ruling on the issue as framed in this case. I now turn to the\n\nlive-wire substantive question—whether an injunction is precluded as a\n\nmatter of law in this case at this early stage of the litigation.\n\f                                    81\n\n      6. Availability of injunction to abate nuisance in this case.\n\nAssuming injunctive relief is available in appropriate cases, as I do, the\n\nnext question is whether a nuisance action is available to the plaintiffs to\n\nabate environmental harms.        As we noted in Freeman, the Iowa\n\nlegislature has enacted a provision establishing a statutory nuisance\n\nclaim that supplements and does not supplant common law nuisance.\n\n848 N.W.2d at 67.       Further, in Freeman, it is noteworthy that a\n\ncomprehensive federal regulatory framework did not preempt state\n\nnuisance regulation. Id. at 69–70. Nuisance law is a sturdy feature of\n\nthe Iowa legal landscape.\n\n      The defendants argue that Iowa Code section 468.2(1) precludes\n\nsuch a nuisance action.      That provision provides, “The drainage of\n\nsurface waters from agricultural lands and all other lands, including\n\nstate-owned lakes and wetlands, or the protection of such lands from\n\noverflow shall be presumed to be a public benefit and conducive to the\n\npublic health, convenience, and welfare.” Iowa Code § 468.2(1).\n\n      In my view, the statute does not categorically eliminate nuisance\n\nclaims. It only establishes a presumption that the activities of a drainage\n\ndistrict are in the public interest, but that presumption may be rebutted.\n\nOur rule of thumb is that a statutory presumption is rebuttable, not\n\nconclusive, unless the legislature has clearly expressed an intent to the\n\ncontrary by saying it is conclusive.     Larsen v. Bd. of Trs., 401 N.W.2d\n\n860, 863 (Iowa 1987) (Wolle, J., dissenting); Neighbors v. Iowa Elec. Light\n\n& Power Co., 175 N.W.2d 97, 102 (Iowa 1970). The majority is wrong to\n\nthink otherwise.\n\n      My view is supported by an examination of other provisions of Iowa\n\nCode chapter 468 where the legislature, unlike in section 468.2(1), did\n\nuse language establishing conclusive or irrebutable presumptions.\n\f                                       82\n\nSpecifically, Iowa Code section 468.47 is entitled “Evidence—conclusive\n\npresumptions” and provides that no evidence is “competent to show that\n\nany of the lands in [a drainage] district . . . will not be benefited by [an]\n\nimprovement in some degree.”           A similar provision, with an escape\n\nclause, may be found in Iowa Code section 468.92, entitled “Conclusive\n\npresumption on appeal.” Similarly, Iowa Code section 468.171 is entitled\n\n“Conclusive presumption of legality.” This section states a final order of\n\na drainage district “shall be conclusive that all prior proceedings were\n\nregular and according to law.”\n\n       Plainly,   the   legislature   knows   how   to   establish    conclusive\n\npresumptions. It repeatedly did so in three sections of chapter 468, two\n\ninvolving a question of fact, another involving a question of law. It did\n\nnot do so in section 468.2(1). To judicially caret in the term “conclusive”\n\nin section 468.2(1) would be to rewrite the statute. We should decline\n\nthat invitation. See In re A.M., 856 N.W.2d 365, 378 (Iowa 2014) (“We are\n\nnot free to rewrite a statute in the guise of interpretation.”).\n\n       Yet, as with the issue of money damages, the question remains\n\nwhether a drainage district would have the statutory authority to comply\n\nwith a mandamus or injunction to abate a nuisance.                 The statutory\n\npowers of a drainage district include the power to engage in repairs and\n\nimprovements in a drainage district. Iowa Code § 468.126. The Code\n\nfurther provides that the powers of a drainage district are to be liberally\n\nconstrued.    Id. § 468.2; see also Clary, 135 Iowa at 495, 113 N.W. at\n\n333.   Yet, the question remains whether a drainage district may take\n\naffirmative steps to abate a nuisance under the maintain-and-repair\n\nprovisions of the statute.\n\f                                     83\n\n      Iowa Code chapter 468 has statutory provisions related to repairs\n\nand improvements.       Under the repair provision of Iowa Code section\n\n468.126(1)(a), the board of supervisors is authorized to\n\n      restore or maintain a drainage or levee improvement in its\n      original efficiency or capacity, and for that purpose may\n      remove silt and debris, repair any damaged structures,\n      remove weeds and other vegetable growth, and whatever else\n      may be needed to restore or maintain such efficiency or\n      capacity or to prolong its useful life.\n\nUnder the improvement provision of Iowa Code section 468.126(4)(a), the\n\nboard of supervisors is authorized to engage in improvements.              An\n\n“improvement” is defined as a project “to expand, enlarge, or otherwise\n\nincrease the capacity of any existing ditch, drain, or other facility above\n\nthat for which it was designed.” Iowa Code § 468.126(4).\n\n      The    question    becomes     whether    under    these     repair-and-\n\nimprovement provisions a drainage district would have authority to\n\nimplement whatever abatement measures that might be required to\n\nremove nitrates from the water which it allegedly collects and deposits in\n\nthe Raccoon River. An argument may be made that the power to abate a\n\nnuisance due to nitrate pollution does not fall into the express terms of\n\nthese statutes.   Any would-be abatement effort does not seem to be a\n\nrepair in the sense of an action to “restore or maintain a[n] . . .\n\nimprovement in its original efficiency or capacity.”      Id. § 468.126(1)(a).\n\nAnd, it can be argued that abating a nuisance is not an improvement\n\nbecause it fails to “expand, enlarge, or otherwise increase the capacity of\n\nany existing ditch, drain, or other facility.” Id. § 468.126(4).\n\n      But if the power to abate a nuisance is not expressly stated, is it\n\nnecessarily implied? See In re Estate of Frentress, 249 Iowa at 786, 89\n\nN.W.2d at 368. Iowa Code chapter 657, which has been around in one\n\nform or another for a long time, states that it is a nuisance to pollute\n\f                                     84\n\nrivers and streams.     Iowa Code § 657.2(4).    It is a crime to create or\n\ncontinue a nuisance. Id. § 657.3. There is no pollution exception in the\n\nlaw for drainage districts. Does the power to create, repair, and maintain\n\na drainage district necessarily imply the duty to comply with a generally\n\napplicable   nuisance    statute   that   includes    criminal   penalties   for\n\nnoncompliance and for which drainage districts are not exempted?\n\n      I conclude that it does.     In particular, it seems to me that the\n\nMaben case takes great pains to distinguish overflow cases, for which no\n\nremedy is available against drainage districts, from pollution cases. See\n\n187 Iowa at 1068–70, 175 N.W. at 515–16.             If there was no potential\n\nexposure of drainage districts for pollution-type claims, it would not have\n\nbeen necessary to draw the distinction. While it would be claiming too\n\nmuch to suggest that the mere fact that the Maben case distinguished\n\npollution cases is determinative on the issue before us, it does give us at\n\nleast some insight into contemporary thinking closer to the time of the\n\ncreation of drainage districts.\n\n      Further, it seems to me necessarily implied that if the drainage\n\ndistrict has the power to build a drainage system, it necessarily has the\n\npower to build it in compliance with generally applicable law affecting\n\npublic health. There are no germane exemptions from external statutory\n\nrequirements in the extensive drainage district statute. Of course, the\n\nMaben reasoning is correct in that there simply cannot be an overflow\n\nclaim because the removal of water from an area of land and introducing\n\nthat water into rivers is precisely what drainage districts do. Id. at 1063–\n\n64, 175 N.W. at 513–14. Allowing an overflow action would thus devour\n\nthe entire statute. But the fact that an overflow claim cannot be made\n\nhas no bearing at all upon the pollution claim presented in this case.\n\nFurther, the holdings in Iowa Employment Security and Polk County\n\f                                     85\n\ndemonstrate that drainage districts have duties outside the scope of Iowa\n\nCode chapter 468. See Polk County, 377 N.W.2d at 241; Iowa Emp’t Sec.,\n\n260 Iowa at 347, 149 N.W.2d at 291.\n\n      I conclude only at this juncture that an injunctive claim based\n\nupon nuisance law is not precluded as a matter of law at this early stage\n\nof the litigation.   See City of Springfield v. N. Fork Drainage Dist., 249\n\nIll. App. 133, 152 (1928) (permitting a city to sue drainage district for\n\npollution); Township of Hatfield v. Lansdale Mun. Auth., 168 A.2d 333,\n\n334 (Pa. 1961) (affirming municipality’s requested injunction against\n\nwater authority).     The DMWW raises claims not with respect to the\n\nlegislature’s distribution of power, but claims related to the improper\n\nexercise of power that the legislature had conferred.\n\n      This does not mean, of course, that a court should accept the facts\n\nare as alleged by DMWW. Under my approach, DMWW would carry the\n\nburden of proving its factual allegations. Further, even if the facts are\n\nproved, I do not believe that DMWW would necessarily be entitled to an\n\ninjunction.   In my view, the drainage district defendants should be\n\nallowed to assert affirmative defenses about which we have no occasion\n\nto now opine.        An injunction is an equitable remedy.        Any court\n\nconsidering whether to grant an injunction in a nuisance case must\n\nbalance the equities by determining, among other things, the scope of the\n\nproblem and the benefits and burdens of any proposed abatement. See\n\nRonald J. Rychlak, Common-Law Remedies for Environmental Wrongs:\n\nThe Role of Private Nuisance, 59 Miss. L.J. 657, 689–93 (1989).\n\n      The majority suggests, without any instructions from the certifying\n\ncourt or factual basis in the nonexistent record, that the most efficient\n\ncost avoider may be the DMWW and not the drainage district. For busy\n\ncourts seeking to maximize efficiency, and particularly federal courts,\n\f                                    86\n\nthere is a temptation to terminate litigation prematurely based on the\n\nperceived factual merits of the underlying controversy.      Although the\n\nquestion of most efficient cost avoider may be a factor when the court\n\nconsiders whether equitable relief is appropriate at the end of the\n\nlitigation, such speculation cannot be used to slam the courthouse doors\n\non DMWW at the beginning of the litigation. And, it may also be that\n\ncertain actions that might effectively abate the nuisance are not, in fact,\n\nwithin the power of the drainage district. That possibility, however, goes\n\nto the merits of this case and cannot be used, as a matter of law, to\n\nterminate this proceeding.\n\n       For the above reasons, I conclude that DMWW should be allowed\n\nto attempt to make its case on its injunctive claim against the drainage\n\ndistrict defendants when the plaintiff seeks compliance with common\n\nand statutory environmental regulations.\n\n      V. Takings Claim Arising from Alleged Pollution of Raccoon\nRiver.\n       A. Introduction. I now turn to the question of whether DMWW\n\nmay bring a takings claim against the drainage district defendants\n\narising out of DMWW’s assertion that because of pollution their right to\n\nclean water has been impaired and that the invasion of the nitrates into\n\nthe DMWW property amounts to a trespass.\n\n       First, I consider whether DMWW, as a governmental subdivision,\n\nhas any property which may fall within the scope of property protected\n\nfrom   uncompensated     takings.    Second,   I   consider whether    one\n\ngovernmental subdivision may bring a takings claim against another\n\ngovernmental subdivision. Third, I consider whether DMWW, by alleging\n\nthat the drainage districts have polluted the Raccoon River, has alleged a\n\ntaking of a compensable property interest. Fourth, I consider whether\n\f                                     87\n\nthe legislative authorization to build drainage districts defeats the\n\ntakings claim in this case.\n\n      B. Takings Claim of Government Bodies: The Question of\n\nPrivate Property.\n\n      1. Overview. There is a relatively small body of literature and a\n\nlarge body of caselaw relating to the question of whether a governmental\n\nsubdivision may bring a takings claim which is limited to “private\n\nproperty.”   See Iowa Const. art. I, § 18 (“Private property shall not be\n\ntaken for public use without just compensation first being made . . . .”).\n\nThe prevailing view is that municipal governments may bring takings\n\nclaims when other governmental entities seize property, at least under\n\ncertain circumstances.\n\n      2. United States Supreme Court caselaw on government as holder of\n\nprivate property: A stranger in town. The United States Supreme Court\n\nhas considered the question of whether a government entity may be\n\nentitled to a takings claim when the United States seizes its property.\n\nThe central question, of course, was whether government-owned property\n\ncould be considered “private property” for purposes of the Fifth\n\nAmendment.\n\n      The Supreme Court’s key case is United States v. 50 Acres of Land,\n\n469 U.S. 24, 105 S. Ct. 451, 83 L. Ed. 2d 376 (1984). In 50 Acres, the\n\nSupreme Court concluded that property held by local government could\n\nbe considered private property for takings purposes under the Fifth\n\nAmendment. Id. at 31, 105 S. Ct. at 455–56, 83 L. Ed. 2d at 383. The\n\nthrust of the rationale was that the loss to the government entity may be\n\nas severe as the loss to a private person or entity. Id. at 31, 105 S. Ct. at\n\n455, 83 L. Ed. 2d at 383. According to the 50 Acres Court,\n\f                                           88\n               When the United States condemns a local public\n       facility, the loss to the public entity, to the persons served by\n       it, and to the local taxpayers may be no less acute than the\n       loss in the taking of private property. Therefore, it is most\n       reasonable to construe the reference to “private property” in\n       the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment as encompassing\n       the property of state and local governments when\n       condemned by the United States.\n\nId. at 31, 105 S. Ct. at 455–56, 83 L. Ed. 2d at 383.\n\n       The case turned on two features.             First, as indicated above, the\n\nterm “private property” was not narrowly construed but instead was\n\nsubject to a functional approach based on the impact of the deprivation\n\non local government. Second, however, one commentator has referred to\n\nthe case’s “stranger in town” aspect—namely, the fact that 50 Acres\n\ninvolved a takings claim by a municipality against a different sovereign.\n\nSee John M. Payne, Intergovernmental Condemnation as a Problem in\n\nPublic Finance, 61 Tex. L. Rev. 949, 954 & n.17 (1983); see also United\n\nStates v. Carmack, 329 U.S. 230, 242, 67 S. Ct. 252, 257, 91 L. Ed. 209,\n\n217 (1946); Trenton, 262 U.S. at 188, 43 S. Ct. at 537, 67 L. Ed. at 941.\n\n       Undeniably, 50 Acres and its progeny involved local government\n\ntakings claims against the federal government.                     Thus, the taking\n\nauthority was thought to be a “stranger in town” in the sense that there\n\nwas no direct legal relationship between the taker and the party suffering\n\nthe loss. 18 Yet, the case unmistakably stands for the proposition, not at\n\nall binding on state courts construing their state constitutions, that the\n\nproperty of a governmental subdivision might be considered “private\n\nproperty” for takings purposes.\n\n\n\n\n       18This assumption, of course, is questionable. Under the Supremacy Clause,\nthe state and federal governments are interconnected because valid exercises of federal\nexecutive and legislative power are binding on the states. See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.\n\f                                       89\n\n      3. State law authority on government property as “private.” State\n\ncourts have grappled with the question of whether government\n\nsubdivision property should be considered “private” for takings purposes.\n\nLike 50 Acres, the state caselaw often reflects a functional approach to\n\nthe question.\n\n      The general theory developed in the state caselaw is that when\n\ncitizens of the state have a beneficial interest in the use of public\n\nproperty there was no taking, but when property was thought to be only\n\nlocally beneficial, the taking was compensable. See Note, The Sovereign’s\n\nDuty to Compensate for the Appropriation of Public Property, 67 Colum. L.\n\nRev. 1083, 1095–96 (1967) [hereinafter The Sovereign’s Duty].            This\n\nconcept was often expressed as a distinction between “governmental” and\n\n“proprietary” purposes. Id. When a local government was deprived of\n\nproprietary property, the taking was compensable.       Id.   But when the\n\nproperty was considered governmental, there was no takings claim. Id.\n\n      The difference, as described by Judge Cooley of the Supreme Court\n\nof Michigan, is that with respect to\n\n      the property [a city] holds for its own private purposes, a city\n      is to be regarded as a constituent in State government, and\n      is entitled to the like protection of its property rights as any\n      natural person who is also a constituent.\n\nPeople ex rel. Bd. of Detroit Park Comm’rs v. Common Council of Detroit, 28\n\nMich. 228, 240 (1873). A large body of state caselaw developed dealing\n\nwith the distinction between local government properties held in\n\ngovernmental capacities and local government properties held in\n\nproprietary capacities. See generally 1A Julius L. Sackman, Nichols on\n\nEminent Domain § 2.27, at 2–158 (3d ed. 2009) [hereinafter Nichols]\n\n(citing cases); 2 Nichols § 5.06[8], at 5–336. The dichotomous approach\n\noften led courts to make difficult factual determinations and to the\n\f                                     90\n\ndevelopment in some jurisdictions of a potentially complex classification\n\nsystem, with some types of local government property declared “in” and\n\nsome declared “out.” The Sovereign’s Duty, 67 Colum. L. Rev. at 1096–\n\n97.\n\n      Certainly the governmental/proprietary approach has its critics.\n\nJustice Frankfurter once characterized the distinction as a “quagmire\n\nthat has long plagued the law of municipal corporations.” Indian Towing\n\nCo. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 65, 76 S. Ct. 122, 124, 100 L. Ed. 48,\n\n53–54 (1955).     Commentators have declared that the cases are “in\n\ndisarray” and reflect a “mindless application of labels.” Rudolph V. Parr,\n\nState Condemnation of Municipally-Owned Property: The Governmental-\n\nProprietary Distinction, 11 Syracuse L. Rev. 27, 34 (1960); Hugh D.\n\nSpitzer, Realigning the Governmental/Proprietary Distinction in Municipal\n\nLaw, 40 Seattle U. L. Rev. 173, 202–03 (2016).\n\n      The difficulties with the distinction have led some to call for a more\n\nfunctional interpretation of the term “private property” in cases involving\n\nmunicipalities.   For instance, in City of Chester v. Commonwealth, the\n\nPennsylvania court, citing federal authority, stated generally that the loss\n\nsuffered by residents of a political subdivision is no less real that the loss\n\nsuffered by private individuals as condemnees. 434 A.2d 695, 702 (Pa.\n\n1981).    An Oregon appellate case cited the different tax bases of\n\ngovernment entities involved in takings litigation, noting that “port\n\ndistricts are . . . distinct from the state. They are supported by a distinct\n\ntax base and they serve a distinct constituency.” Brusco Towboat Co. v.\n\nState By & Through Straub, 570 P.2d 996, 998 (Or. Ct. App. 1997)\n\n(en banc).    Reformers generally call for broadening, rather than\n\nrestricting, what constitutes private property, with a focus, like the\n\nOregon case, on different tax bases and constituencies. The Sovereign’s\n\f                                          91\n\nDuty, 67 Colum. L. Rev. at 1119 (“The fact of particularized loss should\n\nbe sufficient to give a right to compensation to a unit of government.”).\n\n      Most      caselaw,       however,     continues     to    adhere       to      the\n\ngovernmental/proprietary distinction. In these jurisdictions, many have\n\nconsidered   whether       a    waterworks      or   similar   utility    involves    a\n\ngovernmental or proprietary function. The vast majority of cases indicate\n\nthat a waterworks involve a proprietary function for takings clause\n\npurposes. See 2 Nichols § 5.06[8][b] n.56, at 5–340 (citing cases).\n\n      4. Iowa     caselaw       regarding      takings   of    property     held     by\n\nmunicipalities. There are only a few Iowa cases touching on the question\n\nof whether a municipality has a takings claim under article I, section 18\n\nof the Iowa Constitution. In State ex rel. White v. Barker, we stated that\n\nmunicipal corporations are entitled to constitutional protections with\n\n“respect to private and proprietary rights and interests,” and that “[i]t is\n\nquite clear that the establishment and control of waterworks for the\n\nbenefit of the inhabitants of the city” is not a public purpose but is for\n\nthe city’s private benefit such that we would regard the waterworks as a\n\nprivate corporation.   116 Iowa 96, 106, 89 N.W. 204, 207 (1902).                     In\n\nState ex rel. Pritchard v. Grefe, we held that school property involved in a\n\nconsolidation did not involve a takings claim. 139 Iowa 18, 30–31, 117\n\nN.W. 13, 18–19 (1908). In Miller Grocery Co. v. City of Des Moines, we\n\nstated that the waterworks involved the city acting in its proprietary\n\ncapacity. 195 Iowa 1310, 1312–13, 192 N.W. 306, 307 (1923). In State\n\nex rel. Board of Railroad Commissioners v. Stanolind Pipe Line Co., we\n\ngenerally endorsed the distinction between governmental and proprietary\n\nfunctions. 216 Iowa 436, 441, 249 N.W. 366, 369 (1933); see also Mid-\n\nAm. Pipeline Co. v. Iowa State Commerce Comm’n, 255 Iowa 1304, 1312,\n\n125 N.W.2d 801, 805 (1964) (“[P]ublic property is in some respects and\n\f                                    92\n\nunder some conditions protected by the constitutional provisions\n\nprohibiting the taking of private property without just compensation.”).\n\n      5. Discussion. Although the Iowa law is sparse, I conclude that\n\nDMWW may bring a takings claim against the drainage district in this\n\ncase. The approach of Barker, Miller, Stanolind, and Mid-America Pipeline\n\nsupport this conclusion.     As we have stated in a nongovernmental\n\ntakings context, the purpose of just compensation is “designed to bar\n\nGovernment from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens\n\nwhich, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a\n\nwhole.” Parkins v. Bd. of Supervisors, 636 N.W.2d 58, 69–70 (Iowa 2001)\n\n(quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S. Ct. 1563,\n\n1569, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1554, 1561 (1960)). The same principle applies where\n\nintergovernmental takings involve a shifting of benefits and burdens to\n\nthe disadvantage of a local government entity.\n\n      Further, even applying a more restrictive government/proprietary\n\napproach than is reflected in some of our older caselaw, the operation of\n\na waterworks, consistent with the majority of cases in other jurisdictions,\n\nhas been considered proprietary in nature. See, e.g., Phillips v. City of\n\nBradenton, 187 So. 258, 259 (Fla. 1939); Hicks v. City of Monroe Utils.\n\nComm’n, 112 So. 2d 635, 642 (La. 1959); State ex rel. Mt. Sinai Hosp. of\n\nCleveland v. Hickey, 30 N.E.2d 802, 804 (Ohio 1940) (per curiam);\n\nStewart v. City of Cheyenne, 154 P.2d 355, 358 (Wyo. 1944).\n\n      My approach is consistent with the Nichols treatise on the law of\n\neminent domain. According to Nichols, the operation of a waterworks is\n\na private activity, in which municipal corporations\n\n      are mere aggregations of individuals living in the same\n      neighborhood who have banded together to supply\n      themselves with the necessities and conveniences of life . . . .\n      In this character, they are clothed with the capacities of a\n\f                                     93\n      private corporation, and may claim its rights and immunities\n      and are subject to its liabilities.\n\n1A Nichols § 2.27 at 2–159. Thus, “[t]he property acquired by municipal\ncorporations for the private benefit of their inhabitants is protected by\n\nthe constitution, and can be taken only by eminent domain, and upon\n\npayment of its value.” Id. § 2.27, at 2–163.\n\n      C. Takings Claim of Government Subdivisions Against Other\n\nGovernment Subdivisions: The Question of Standing. Closely related\n\nto the question of whether government property may be considered\n\nprivate for takings purposes is the question of whether government\n\nsubdivisions may bring takings claims against other state government\n\nentities. Some cases stand for the broad proposition that a subdivision\n\ncannot bring takings claims against other government entities on the\n\nground that the state itself created government subdivisions and that the\n\nstate cannot sue itself.      Other cases, however, consistent with the\n\ngovernmental/proprietary distinction discussed above, have held that\n\nlocal governments may bring takings claims to prevent unfair shifting of\n\nthe benefits and burdens of government.\n\n      It would be wrong, however, to conclude, as the majority seems to,\n\nthat public entities can never raise any constitutional questions in\n\nlitigation with other state entities.       There is certainly a narrow\n\nproposition   that   is   comparatively   well   established,   namely,   that\n\ngovernment subdivisions cannot challenge the constitutionality of\n\nstatutes under which they operate or under which they were created.\n\nDep’t of Revenue, 263 N.W.2d at 232.\n\n      This narrow proposition, to me, is defensible.       A county cannot\n\ncomplain that the state prohibited it from engaging in certain activities\n\nbecause the state has the power to shape the configuration of its political\n\f                                    94\n\nsubdivisions. I have applied this narrow rule with respect to claims that\n\nthe legislative action allocating power to drainage districts but failing to\n\ninclude a money-damage remedy violated various provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution.\n\n      But these standing cases only advance a narrow proposition,\n\nnamely, that government subdivisions cannot challenge the state’s\n\nlimitations on their own authority. The cases do not stand for a broad,\n\ngeneral proposition that government subdivisions can never raise\n\nconstitutional claims.   In my view, government subdivisions can raise\n\ntakings claims against other governmental subdivisions.\n\n      It is true, perhaps, that older caselaw contains sweeping language\n\nabout the lack of standing of government subdivisions to raise\n\nconstitutional questions. Specifically, in Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh, the\n\nSupreme Court employed language, largely dicta, suggesting that\n\ngovernment subdivisions may not raise constitutional issues in disputes\n\nagainst the state. 207 U.S. 161, 179, 28 S. Ct. 40, 46–47, 52 L. Ed. 151,\n\n159 (1907). But the language in Hunter was not unqualified. According\n\nto Hunter,\n\n            It will be observed that in describing the absolute\n      power of the State over the property of municipal\n      corporations, we have not extended it beyond the property\n      held and used for governmental purposes.            Such\n      corporations are sometimes authorized to hold and do hold\n      property for the same purposes that property is held by\n      private corporations or individuals.\n\nId.\n\n      Later, in Trenton, the Supreme Court declined to apply the\n\ngovernmental/proprietary distinction in a case where a municipality\n\nsought to invoke the protections of the Federal Takings Clause against\n\nthe state. 262 U.S. at 191–92, 43 S. Ct. at 538, 67 L. Ed. at 942–43.\n\f                                     95\n\nThe Trenton Court thus held that, irrespective of the nature of the\n\nactivities of the municipality, the municipality could not invoke\n\nconstitutional protections against the state. Id.\n\n      But the Hunter–Trenton doctrine has fallen into disuse. It has not\n\nbeen employed to bar a local constitutional challenge since 1933. See\n\nNixon v. Mo. Mun. League, 541 U.S. 125, 131, 124 S. Ct. 1555, 1560, 158\n\nL. Ed. 2d   291,   299   (2004)   (considering   merits   of   municipalities’\n\nSupremacy Clause challenge to a state statute); Romer v.

Morris, The Case for Local Constitutional Enforcement, 47\n\nHarv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 1, 3–4 (2012) [hereinafter Morris].\n\f                                     96\n\n      The cases of Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S. Ct. 125, 5\n\nL. Ed. 2d 110 (1960), and Allen, 392 U.S. at 236, 88 S. Ct. at 1923, 20\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 1060, illustrate the erosion of Hunter. In Gomillion, Justice\n\nFrankfurter limited the scope of Hunter and Trenton to the specific\n\nconstitutional provisions involved in those cases, namely the Contract\n\nClause, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\nUnited States Constitution.      364 U.S. at 344, 81 S. Ct. at 128, 5\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 115. According to the Court,\n\n            [A] correct reading of the seemingly unconfined dicta of\n      Hunter and kindred cases is not that the State has plenary\n      power to manipulate in every conceivable way, for every\n      conceivable purpose, the affairs of its municipal\n      corporations, but rather that the State’s authority is\n      unrestrained      by the particular prohibitions of the\n      Constitution considered in those cases.\n\nId. Additionally, the Gomillion Court noted that “[l]egislative control of\n\nmunicipalities . . . lies within the scope of relevant limitations imposed by\n\nthe United States Constitution.”      Id. at 344–45, 81 S. Ct. at 129, 5\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 115. As noted by one later federal circuit, “Hunter, Trenton,\n\nand allied cases are substantive holdings that the [Federal] Constitution\n\ndoes not interfere in states’ internal political organization. They are not\ndecisions about a municipality’s standing to sue its state.”         Rogers v.\n\nBrockette, 588 F.2d 1057, 1069 (5th Cir. 1979); see also Michael A.\n\nLawrence, Do “Creatures of the State” Have Constitutional Rights?:\n\nStanding for Municipality to Assert Procedural Due Process Claims Against\n\nthe State, 47 Vill. L. Rev. 93, 101 (2002) [hereinafter Lawrence].\n\n      Further, the animating principle in Hunter and Trenton is that\n\nfederal courts should not consider federal constitutional claims brought\n\nby government subdivisions against the state.             In other words,\n\nconsiderations of federalism played a significant role in denying standing\n\f                                    97\n\nfor adjudication of intragovernmental disputes in state court.              Hunter\n\nand Trenton are not authority on the question of whether a government\n\nsubdivision may bring state constitutional claims in a state court against\n\nthe state. See Bd. of Levee Comm’rs of the Orleans Levy Bd. v. Huls, 852\n\nF.2d 140, 143 (5th Cir. 1988) (finding the concept of state suing itself\n\nuntenable in federal system).\n\n      Indeed, we have at least entertained constitutional challenges\n\nraised by local governments against state entities in contexts other than\n\nchallenges to limitations of power. For example, in City of Coralville v.\n\nIowa Utilities Board, the city challenged a tariff regime promulgated\n\npursuant to Iowa Code chapter 476 and sought to be enforced by the\n\nIowa Utilities Board.    750 N.W.2d 523, 527 (Iowa 2008).                The city’s\n\nchallenge was in part rooted in the uniformity requirements of article I,\n\nsection 6 and article III, section 30 of the Iowa Constitution, collectively\n\nviewed as providing protection similar in scope, import, and purpose to\n\nthe equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n\nFederal Constitution. Id. at 530. We considered this challenge on the\n\nmerits, concluding under the facts and circumstances presented that\n\nthere was no constitutional infirmity. Id. at 531.\n\n      According to one authority, municipal corporations may have\n\nstanding to assert procedural due process claims against their creating\n\nstate for the deprivation of certain liberty and property interests that do\n\nnot   involve   substantive   matters    of   the   state’s   internal     political\n\norganization. See Lawrence, 47 Vill. L. Rev. at 94 n.7; Morris, 47 Harv.\n\nC.R.-C.L. L. Rev. at 43–44. This is precisely the situation that arose in\n\nCity of Coralville, 750 N.W.2d at 526.\n\n      In any event, state takings law has traditionally recognized the\n\ndistinction between proprietary and governmental functions in its state\n\f                                     98\n\nlaw and allowed municipalities to bring takings claims against other\n\ngovernmental entities. As noted above, Iowa caselaw has long recognized\n\nthe distinction between proprietary and governmental functions.        See,\n\ne.g., Stanolind, 216 Iowa at 441, 249 N.W. at 369; Scott County v.\n\nJohnson, 209 Iowa 213, 221, 222 N.W. 378, 381 (1928); Miller Grocery,\n\n195 Iowa at 1312, 192 N.W. at 307; Grefe, 139 Iowa at 30–31, 117 N.W.\n\nat 18–19; Barker, 116 Iowa at 106, 89 N.W. at 207–08. In these\n\ntraditional terms, in the context of a taking, a municipal water supplier\n\ndrawing water from a public water source is acting in a proprietary\n\ncapacity. DMWW in providing its services is not acting on behalf of the\n\nstate but as an agent of its local customers. See Morris, 47 Harv. C.R.-\n\nC.L. L. Rev. at 7. DMWW should not be regarded as an instrument of the\n\nstate, but an instrument of the citizens it serves.\n\n      Thus, while it may be that a government subdivision cannot\n\nchallenge matters related to the internal political organization of the\n\nstate, it can challenge actions of government subdivisions that allegedly\n\nrun afoul of the specific constitutional command of the takings provision\n\nof article I, section 18 of the Iowa Constitution.    Therefore, I conclude\n\nthat DMWW has standing to bring its takings claim under Iowa\n\nConstitution, article I, section 18 against the drainage district.\n\n      D. Property Interest: Riparian Water Pollution as Taking of\n\n“Property.”    According to one commentator, one of the most divisive\n\nissues in contemporary natural resource law in the United States is\n\nwhether interests in water are recognized as property. Sandra B. Zellmer\n\n& Jessica Harder, Unbundling Property in Water, 59 Ala. L. Rev. 679,\n\n681–82 (2008). Among other things, how one characterizes the “stick” is\n\ncritical in the analysis. DMWW does not assert a right to allocation of\n\nwater, but rather a riparian right of use.\n\f                                     99\n\n      The word “riparian” comes from the Latin word for “bank.” Note,\n\nPrivate Remedies for Water Pollution, 70 Colum. L. Rev. 734, 735 (1970).\n\nRiparian rights are restricted to owners of land with a bank fronting\n\nupon some point on the watercourse. Id. “Riparian rights do not depend\n\nupon ownership of the watercourse’s bed and do not include ownership\n\nof the water itself.” 1 Linda A. Malone, Riparian Rights, Environmental\n\nRegulation of Land Use § 8.2, Westlaw LWATRR (database updated Nov.\n\n2016) [hereinafter Malone].      Because of the pollution, according to\n\nDMWW, it cannot use the water without expenditure of funds to remove\n\nthe nitrates.\n\n      It may seem a right of use is somewhat intangible and a novel\n\nproperty concept. But easements across land involve a right of use and\n\nthey have long been recognized as a kind of property interest, and Iowa\n\ncaselaw supports that proposition. See Bormann v. Bd. of Supervisors,\n\n584 N.W.2d 309, 316 (Iowa 1998); Hosford v. Metcalf, 113 Iowa 240,\n\n244–45, 84 N.W. 1054, 1055–56 (1901) (describing how a license may\n\nbecome an easement on the land which is then a transferable interest in\n\nproperty); see generally Eugene Davis, Water Rights in Iowa, 41 Iowa L.\n\nRev. 216, 220–23 (1956).\n\n      And, there are many cases from other jurisdictions that suggest\n\nthat riparian rights include the right to water of a certain quality. See,\n\ne.g., Harrell v. City of Conway, 271 S.W.2d 924, 926 (Ark. 1954); Collens\n\nv. New Canaan Water Co., 234 A.2d 825, 831 (Conn. 1967); Montelious v.\n\nElsea, 161 N.E.2d 675, 678 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl. 1959); see also Robin\n\nKundis Craig, Defining Riparian Rights as “Property” Through Takings\n\nLitigation: Is There a Property Right to Environmental Quality?, 42 Envtl.\n\nL. 115, 145 & n.232 (2012).       The leading authorities approve of this\n\napproach.       See, e.g., 3 Tiffany Real Property § 730, Westlaw (3d ed.\n\f                                    100\n\ndatabase updated 2016) [hereinafter Tiffany] (“The right of the riparian\n\nowner . . . extends to the quality as well as the quantity of the water\n\n. . . .”); 1 Malone § 8.2 (“[A] riparian has a right to the natural flow of a\n\nwatercourse without change in quantity or quality.”).\n\n      The notion of a riparian right to water quality is embraced in the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts. Section 850 provides a reasonable use\n\nrule, stating “A riparian proprietor is subject to liability for making an\n\nunreasonable use of the water of a watercourse or lake that causes harm\n\nto another riparian proprietor’s reasonable use of water or his land.”\n\nRestatement of the Law (Second) Torts § 850, at 217. Section 850A then\n\nprovides a number of factors to be considered in determining reasonable\n\nuse, including,\n\n            (a) [t]he purpose of the use,\n\n            (b) the suitability of the use to the watercourse or lake,\n\n            (c) the economic value of the use,\n\n            (d) the social value of the use,\n\n            (e) the extent and amount of the harm it causes,\n\n            (f) the practicality of avoiding the harm by adjusting\n      the use or method of use of one proprietor or the other,\n\n            (g) the practicality of adjusting the quantity of water\n      used by each proprietor,\n\n             (h) the protection of existing values of water uses,\n      land, investments and enterprises, and\n\n            (i) the justice of requiring the user causing harm to\n      bear the loss.\n\nId. § 850A, at 220; see generally 1 Malone § 8.2; A. Dan Tarlock, Law of\n\nWater Rights and Resources § 3.60, Westlaw (database updated July\n\n2016) (rejecting abstract standards or per se rules in favor of analysis of\n\f                                        101\n\nwhat uses are in fact protected based on all relevant facts and\n\ncircumstances).\n\n       As is apparent from this test, the law of nuisance and the law of\n\ntakings overlap substantially.         Many of the factors of nuisance are\n\nsimilar to those in the Restatement. The inquiry of whether a nuisance\n\nis present and whether a taking requiring just compensation has arisen\n\nare determined by a similar, fact-based inquiry. 19\n\n       The relationship between nuisance and takings law is further\n\nillustrated in our caselaw.       For instance, in Bormann, we held that a\n\nnuisance immunity provision in an agricultural land preservation statute\n\nwas an unconstitutional taking under the United States and Iowa\n\nConstitutions. 584 N.W.2d at 321. We came to a similar conclusion in\n\nGacke, where we held that a statutory grant of nuisance immunity\n\namounted to a taking of property that required payment of just\n\ncompensation. 684 N.W.2d at 175.\n\n       How the Restatement (Second) section 850A factors would play out\n\nin this litigation, of course, cannot be determined at this stage. Some of\n\nthe factors may support the drainage district defendants, while others\n\nmay support DMWW. At this time, the question of whether DMWW has a\n\nvalid property interest based on its riparian rights cannot be decided as a\n\nmatter of law, but is a question of fact.                  See 3 Tiffany § 730\n\n(“[R]easonable use of water . . . [is] one of fact.”].\n\n\n\n\n        19We have no occasion to opine now whether the test for a taking of a riparian\n\ninterest in the use of water is the same as a nuisance claim or, as suggested by one\ncommentator, somewhat more demanding. See Carlos A. Ball, The Curious Intersection\nof Nuisance and Takings Law, 86 B.U. L. Rev. 819, 878–79 (2006). Ball reads our\nBormann case as indicating that the proof required for nuisance and taking is the same\nunder Iowa law. Id. at 854–56.\n\f                                   102\n\n      E. State Authorization as Defeating Takings Claim.               The\n\nmajority suggests that because drainage districts advance legitimate\n\nstate interests, there can be no takings claim. I view this as an incorrect\n\nstatement of law.\n\n      It certainly cannot be denied that drainage districts advance\n\nlegitimate state interests.   But the argument proves too much.        For\n\nexample, a sewage treatment plant advances legitimate state interests,\n\nbut can it be said categorically that there is no taking if a sewage\n\ntreatment plant so pollutes waterways that it is no longer safe to inhabit\n\ndownstream property? See Bowman v. Humphrey, 132 Iowa 234, 236–\n\n37, 109 N.W. 714, 715 (1906) (holding that nuisance is still a nuisance\n\neven if it comes from a “legitimate enterprise, or one of great and general\n\nconvenience and benefit”); accord Newton v. City of Grundy Center, 246\n\nIowa 916, 922, 70 N.W.2d 162, 165 (1955).        I note with interest that\n\nwhile some nuisance statues expressly exempt “conduct done or\n\nmandated under a statute,” see, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 3482 (West,\n\nWestlaw current through 2016 Reg. Sess., ch. 8 of 2015–2016 2d Ex.\n\nSess. and all propositions on the 2016 ballot); Wash. Rev. Code Ann.\n\n§ 7.48.160 (West, Westlaw current through 2016 Reg. and 1st Special\n\nSess.). Iowa’s nuisance statute does not have such a provision.\n\n      Meiners and Yandel, authorities on law and economics, make the\n\naforementioned point by citing the classic case of Carmichael v. City of\n\nTexarkana, 94 F. 561 (W.D. Ark. 1899). Roger Meiners & Bruce Yandle,\n\nCommon Law and the Conceit of Modern Environmental Policy, 7 Geo.\n\nMason L. Rev. 923, 945 (1999). The Carmichaels owned a forty-five-acre\n\nfarm in Texas located on the border with Arkansas. Id. at 561. The city\n\nof Texarkana, Arkansas, built a sewage plant for the city and proceeded\n\nto deposit sewage immediately opposite the plaintiffs homestead about\n\f                                   103\n\neight feet from the state line.   Id. at 562.   The defendant alleged the\n\nsewage plant created a “cesspool” and was “a great nuisance, because it\n\nfouls, pollutes, corrupts, contaminates, and poisons the water.” Id. The\n\ncourt noted that the city was operating properly under state law to build\n\nthe sewer system. Id. at 564. But the lawfulness of the system did not\n\nprevent the claim. Id. at 564–66. According to the court,\n\n      If a riparian proprietor has a right to enjoy a river so far\n      unpolluted that fish can live in it and cattle drink of it, and\n      the town council of a neighboring borough, professing to act\n      under statutory powers, pour their house drainage and the\n      filth from water-closets into the river in such quantities that\n      the water becomes corrupt and stinks, and fish will no\n      longer live in it, nor cattle drink it, the court will grant an\n      injunction to prevent the continued defilement of the stream\n      ....\n\nId. at 573.\n\n      Based on applicable caselaw, I do not think the fact that the\n\nlegislature has authorized the construction of drainage improvements\n\nmeans that a takings claim cannot be presented when a drainage district\n\nallegedly operates its drainage district in violation of the environmental\n\nlaws in Iowa Code chapter 657 and common law nuisance.\n\n      VI. Conclusion.\n\n      Based on the above reasoning, I would answer the certified\n\nquestions as follows.\n\n      Question 1: As a matter of Iowa law, does the doctrine of implied\n\nimmunity of drainage districts as applied in cases such as Fisher v.\n\nDallas County, 369 N.W.2d 426 (Iowa 1985), grant drainage districts\n\nunqualified immunity from all of the damage claims set forth in the\n\nComplaint (docket no. 2)?\n\n      Answer: Yes as to money damages generally.            No as to just\n\ncompensation that might arise from a takings claim.\n\f                                    104\n\n      Question 2: As a matter of Iowa law, does the doctrine of implied\n\nimmunity grant drainage districts unqualified immunity from equitable\n\nremedies and claims, other than mandamus?\n\n      Answer: No.\n\n      Question 3: As a matter of Iowa law, can the plaintiff assert\n\nprotections afforded by the Iowa Constitution’s inalienable rights, due\n\nprocess, equal protection, and takings clauses against drainage districts\n\nas alleged in the complaint?\n\n      Answer: Yes with respect to the takings clause, no with respect to\n\nall other clauses.\n\n      Question 4: As a matter of Iowa law, does the plaintiff have a\n\nproperty interest that may be the subject of a claim under the Iowa\n\nConstitution’s takings clause as alleged in the complaint?\n\n      Answer: Possibly, depending on further factual development.\n\n      In summary, I would find that DMWW’s lawsuit should be allowed\n\nto proceed. Of course, I express no view on the merits of the litigation.\n\n      Cady, C.J., joins this concurrence in part and dissent in part.\n\f",

The plaintiff is a\n\nmunicipal waterworks; the defendants are upstream drainage districts\n\nand their trustees.    The plaintiff provides drinking water to central\n\nIowans and is suing for money damages and other remedies to recover its\n\ncosts to remove nitrates from Raccoon River water.            The case was\n\nbrought in federal court.    Our role is simply to answer the following\n\nquestions of Iowa law certified by that court.\n\n      Question 1: As a matter of Iowa law, does the doctrine of implied\n\nimmunity of drainage districts as applied in cases such as Fisher v.\n\nDallas County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1240629\"><a href=\"/opinion/1240629/fisher-v-dallas-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 1985), grant drainage districts\n\nunqualified immunity from all of the damage claims set forth in the\n\ncomplaint (docket no. 2)?\n\n      Answer: Yes. As explained below, drainage districts have a\n\nlimited, targeted role—to facilitate the drainage of farmland in order to\n\nmake it more productive. Accordingly, Iowa law has immunized drainage\n\ndistricts from damages claims for over a century.       This immunity was\n\nreaffirmed unanimously by our court just over four years ago.\n\n      Question 2: As a matter of Iowa law, does the doctrine of implied\n\nimmunity grant drainage districts unqualified immunity from equitable\n\nremedies and claims other than mandamus?\n\n      Answer: Yes. Again, Iowa precedent, reaffirmed unanimously by\n\nour court just four years ago, recognizes that drainage districts are\n\nimmune from injunctive relief claims other than mandamus.\n\n      Question 3: As a matter of Iowa law, can the plaintiff assert\n\nprotections afforded by the Iowa Constitution’s inalienable rights, due\n\f                                           4\n\nprocess, equal protection, and takings clauses against drainage districts\n\nas alleged in the complaint?\n\n       Answer: No. Although            these      constitutional       clauses       are\n\nfundamental to our freedom in Iowa, they exist to protect citizens against\n\noverreaching      government.          Generally,     one    subdivision      of   state\n\ngovernment cannot sue another subdivision of state government under\n\nthese clauses. And even if they could, an increased need to treat nitrates\n\ndrawn from river water to meet standards for kitchen tap water would\n\nnot amount to a constitutional violation.\n\n       Question 4: As a matter of Iowa law, does the plaintiff have a\n\nproperty interest that may be the subject of a claim under the Iowa\n\nConstitution’s takings clause as alleged in the complaint?\n\n       Answer: No,      for   the    reasons     discussed     in   the    answer     to\n\nQuestion 3.\n\n       In the balance of this opinion, we will explain our reasoning behind\n\nthese answers. We emphasize that our decision does not relate to other\n\nmatters raised in the federal court litigation, including claims brought\n\nunder federal law.\n\n       I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n       To provide context for the certified questions, we adopt this\n\ndiscussion from the federal court’s certification order.                  See Foley v.\n\nArgosy Gaming Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2204581\"><a href=\"/opinion/2204581/foley-v-argosy-gaming-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246 (Iowa 2004) (“We restrict our\n\ndiscussion to the facts provided with the certified questions.”). 1\n\n       A. The Des Moines Water Works. Plaintiff, the Board of Water\n\nWorks Trustees of the City of Des Moines, Iowa, also known as the\n\n       1We  reiterate the certifying court’s disclaimer that no judicial fact-finding has\noccurred. The factual background is drawn from allegations of the pleadings that were\nadmitted or denied for lack of information.\n\f                                                5\n\nDes Moines Water Works (DMWW), is a municipal water utility under\n\nIowa Code chapter 388 (2015) 2 that provides drinking water to an\n\nestimated half-million Iowans in the Des Moines area, both by direct\n\nservice and wholesale service to other utilities and districts.                      DMWW\n\nobtains its water primarily from the Raccoon and Des Moines Rivers.\n\nThe Raccoon River drains about 2.3 million acres from portions of\n\nseventeen Iowa counties, including Buena Vista, Sac, and Calhoun. It\n\nflows approximately 186 miles from its origin in Buena Vista County to\n\nits confluence          with   the    Des      Moines   River, south         of    downtown\n\nDes Moines.\n\n        Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) as amended in 1996,\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 300f–300j (2012), DMWW is obligated to meet the maximum\n\ncontaminant level standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency\n\n(EPA) in the water it serves to consumers. The SDWA is the key federal\n\nlaw for protecting public water supplies from harmful contaminants.\n\nSection 300g–1, as amended in 1996, directs the EPA to select\n\ncontaminants for regulatory consideration based on occurrence, health\n\neffects, and meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 300g–1(b).        For each contaminant that the EPA determines requires\n\nregulation, the EPA must set a nonenforceable maximum contaminant\n\nlevel goal at a level that avoids known or anticipated adverse health\n\neffects and that allows an adequate margin of safety.                             Id. § 300g–\n\n1(b)(4)(A). The EPA must then set an enforceable standard, a maximum\n\ncontaminant level (MCL), as close to the goal as is feasible, using the best\n\ntechnology, treatment techniques, or other means available and taking\n\ncosts    into      consideration.        Id.    § 300g–1(b)(4)(B).      The        maximum\n\n        2All   references are to the 2015 Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\f                                   6\n\ncontaminant level for nitrate, promulgated in 2012 and currently in\n\nforce, is 10 mg/L, close to the equivalent of ten parts per million. See\n\nEPA,     Table   of   Regulated     Drinking     Water    Contaminants,\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/table-regulated-\n\ndrinking-water-contaminants (last visited Jan. 12, 2017).    Nitrate is a\n\nsoluble ion of nitrogen, found in soil, which only leaves the soil when\n\ndrawn out by the flow of water. See id. The health risks associated with\n\nnitrate contamination in drinking water include blue baby syndrome and\n\npotential endocrine disruption impacts. Id.\n\n       In its complaint filed in federal court, DMWW states that from\n\n1995 to 2014, nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon River at the DMWW\n\nintake points exceeded the 10 mg/L standard for drinking water at least\n\n1636 days, or twenty-four percent of the time. In 2013 and 2014, the\n\naverage nitrate concentration in the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers was\n\n11.98 mg/L, the third highest average in the last forty years. Similarly,\n\nin September, October, November, and December 2014, the average\n\nnitrate concentration was 11.89 mg/L, 13.23 mg/L, 13.43 mg/L, and\n\n12.56 mg/L, respectively.\n\n       DMWW states that it utilizes three water treatment plants to\n\nprocess source water into drinking water. These three treatment plants,\n\nthe McMullen Plant, the Saylorville Plant, and the Fleur Plant, all draw\n\nwater from the Raccoon River. DMWW has managed excess nitrates in\n\nthe source water it processes in several ways.    At the Fleur Plant, a\n\nfraction of the water undergoes an ion exchange process to remove\n\nnitrates and then is blended with filtered water to stay below the EPA’s\n\n10 mg/L standard. In addition to drawing water from the Raccoon River,\n\nthe McMullen Plant draws water from Crystal Lake, a river-influenced\n\nsurface water source managed to provide reduced-nitrogen water\n\f                                          7\n\nthrough natural biologic processes.           DMWW also can blend the water\n\nfrom the McMullen Plant with nitrate-free water drawn from a reservoir\n\nused as an emergency backup water source. The Saylorville Plant is the\n\nonly plant operated by DMWW that has a limited capacity to remove\n\nnitrates.\n\n       Additionally, DMWW has an ion exchange nitrate-removal facility\n\nthat it operates as needed at a cost of approximately $4000–$7000 per\n\nday. 3 DMWW utilized its nitrate removal continuously due to excessive\n\nnitrate levels until March 10, 2015. The continuous operation for a total\n\nof ninety-six days is the longest in the history of the facility’s operation\n\nduring the winter season. DMWW states that, due to the age and limited\n\ncapacity of the existing nitrate-removal facility, it will need to design and\n\nconstruct a new nitrate-removal facility with a fifty-million-gallon-per-day\n\ncapacity at a cost of between $76 million and $183.5 million before 2020.\n\nOperation and maintenance costs will be in addition to the initial\n\nestimated capital cost.\n\n       B. The Drainage Districts. Drainage districts were instituted in\n\nIowa to allow wetlands to be turned into productive farmland.                    The\n\npurpose of drainage districts in Iowa can be traced back to the late\n\n1800s and early 1900s. See Swamp Land Act of 1850, ch. 84, 9 Stat.\n\n519 (codified at 43 U.S.C. §§ 982–984 (2012)); Hatch, Holbrook & Co. v.\n\nPottawattamie County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1876); Iowa Const. art. I, § 18 (as\n\namended in 1908). Vast areas of flatland could not be farmed due to\n\ninadequate drainage.        Iowa Code chapter 468 and Iowa Constitution\n\n\n       3It is unclear from DMWW’s filings whether this nitrate-removal facility is\nlocated at one of its water treatment plants or treats water received from all plants.\nDMWW indicates that its nitrate-removal facility removes nitrates from its finished\nwater.\n\f                                     8\n\narticle I, section 18 govern drainage districts. Drainage districts enable\n\nproperty owners to jointly fund drainage improvements. See Fisher, 369\n\nN.W.2d at 428–29.\n\n            The right of a landowner to place tiles in swales or\n      ditches to carry the water from ponds upon and onto lower\n      lands . . . is necessary . . . in order that low and swampy\n      lands may be reclaimed, and a denial thereof would be\n      productive of incalculable mischief.\n\nDorr v. Simmerson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 807 (1905). To\n\nestablish a drainage district, at least two landowners must petition for its\n\ncreation. Iowa Code § 468.6. The affairs of the drainage district are then\n\nmanaged by the county board of supervisors in a representative capacity.\n\nSee, e.g., id. §§ 468.37, .89, .231, .232, .617. The board determines what\n\nimprovements are needed.       Id. § 468.126(1)(a).   If the cost exceeds\n\n$50,000, a hearing is required to determine advisability of expenditure,\n\nand an appeal is allowed. Id. § 468.126(1)(c). Improvements exceeding a\n\ncertain amount can be stopped by a majority of landowners in the\n\ndistrict through a process called remonstrance. Id. § 468.126(4)(c).\n\n      Drainage districts “have only such         [limited] power    as the\n\nlegislature grants them.” Reed v. Muscatine Louisa Drainage Dist. #13,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1927763\"><a href=\"/opinion/1927763/reed-v-muscatine-louisa-drain-dist-no-13/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 551 (Iowa 1978). Iowa’s legislature concluded drainage\n\nfrom agricultural and other lands shall be presumed to benefit the\n\npublic:\n\n            1. The drainage of surface waters from agricultural\n      lands and all other lands, including state-owned lakes and\n      wetlands, or the protection of such lands from overflow shall\n      be presumed to be a public benefit and conducive to the\n      public health, convenience, and welfare.\n            2. The provisions of this subchapter and all other laws\n      for the drainage and protection from overflow of agricultural\n      or overflow lands shall be liberally construed to promote\n      leveeing, ditching, draining and reclamation of wet, swampy,\n      and overflow lands.\n\f                                      9\n\nIowa Code § 468.2(1)–(2).\n\n      The thirteen defendant drainage districts in this case are located in\n\nthe North Raccoon watershed and the Des Moines Lobe geographic\n\nformation.   The primary purpose of their drainage infrastructure is to\n\nremove water from agricultural lands.       Private subsurface tiles convey\n\nwater to other subsurface tiles, pipe, subsurface ditches, and channels\n\ncreated and maintained by the defendants, which in turn convey water to\n\nstreams and rivers, and ultimately the Raccoon River.\n\n      C. Procedural Background.           The defendants filed motions for\n\nsummary      judgment    seeking   dismissal   of   DMWW’s    federal     court\n\ncomplaint on several grounds, including the immunities enjoyed by\n\ndrainage districts under Iowa law. After the summary judgment motions\n\nwere briefed and argued, the federal court instructed the parties to meet,\n\nconfer, and come to an agreement on the identification and description of\n\nstate law issues that could be certified to the Iowa Supreme Court and\n\nalso instructed the parties to explain whether they believed these issues\n\nshould be certified.    The parties filed a joint certification report.    The\n\nparties agreed on the wording of the four questions, but disagreed as to\n\nwhether the questions should be certified.            The DMWW favored\n\ncertification. The defendants argued against certification as unnecessary\n\nbecause controlling precedent answered the questions.\n\n      D. The DMWW’s Claims. DMWW’s complaint alleges ten causes\n\nof action: Count I for violation of various federal statutes known as the\n\nClean Water Act; Count II for violation of Iowa Code section 455B.186 (“A\n\npollutant shall not be disposed of by dumping, depositing, or discharging\n\nsuch pollutant into any water of the state . . . .”); Count III for public\n\nnuisance; Count IV for statutory nuisance; Count V for private nuisance;\n\nCount VI for trespass; Count VII for negligence; Count VIII for taking\n\f                                    10\n\nwithout just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the\n\nUnited States Constitution as made applicable by the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment and article I, section 18 of the Iowa Constitution; Count IX\n\nfor violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the due\n\nprocess and equal protection clauses of the Iowa Constitution; and\n\nCount X for permanent, prospective injunctive relief.\n\n        DMWW essentially argues that the defendants are responsible for\n\nthe increased nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon River.          DMWW\n\nalleges it may be forced to construct a new, high-capacity nitrate-removal\n\nfacility, to comply with the SDWA.           DMWW’s state and federal\n\nconstitutional liability theories are based on its claim that the drainage\n\ndistricts are responsible for the increased level of nitrates in the source\n\nwater the DMWW must process.\n\n        Against this backdrop, we turn to the certified questions,\n\nbeginning with the threshold issue of whether we should elect to answer\n\nthem.\n\n        II. Our Discretion to Answer Certified Questions.\n\n        The DMWW and the certifying federal court urge us to answer the\n\nfour certified questions. The drainage districts, however, argue that we\n\nshould decline to answer the questions on grounds that controlling\n\nprecedent is determinative. “Iowa Code section 684A.1 allows this court\n\nto answer questions of Iowa law certified to us by a federal court that\n\nconcludes controlling precedent is lacking when the answer may be\n\ndeterminative of the federal proceeding.” Oyens Feed & Supply, Inc. v.\n\nPrimebank, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188 (Iowa 2011). In Foley, we noted our\n\ndiscretion to answer certified questions that (1) were certified by a proper\n\ncourt, (2) presented questions of Iowa law, (3) “may be determinative of\n\f                                    11\n\nthe cause . . . pending in the certifying court,” and (4) appeared to the\n\ncertifying court to have no controlling Iowa precedent.     688 N.W.2d at\n\n246 (quoting Iowa Code § 684A.1 (2003)).\n\n       The first three requirements are easily met here: the federal court\n\ncertified four questions of Iowa law that, if resolved adversely to DMWW,\n\nwould result in summary judgment dismissing its state law claims. “We\n\ndo not have a situation where the answers to the questions are fact-\n\ndependent or the facts are in conflict. These are pure questions of law.”\n\nIowa Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Tooker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427 (Iowa\n\n2011) (citations omitted) (distinguishing cases declining to answer\n\ncertified questions that required resolution of factual disputes). It is the\n\nfourth requirement that gives us pause because, as the certifying court\n\nrecognized, we have controlling precedent that resolves the questions in\n\nfavor of the drainage districts, assuming that precedent remains good\n\nlaw.\n\n       The federal court candidly acknowledged in its certification order\n\nthat if it did not certify the questions, it “would have to reject the\n\nthoughtful, creative, novel, and well-argued positions of DMWW as\n\nunsupported by Iowa law.” The court concluded that, given the public\n\nimportance of the case it described as “one of first impression,”\n\ncertification was appropriate to enable our court to decide the questions\n\nunder our state law.\n\n       We addressed the quandary of whether to answer certified\n\nquestions despite controlling precedent in Foley, in which the first\n\ncertified question asked, “Does the requirement of ‘special injury’ to state\n\na claim for a malicious prosecution action still remain the law of Iowa?”\n\n688 N.W.2d at 246 (emphasis added).        John Foley claimed the Argosy\n\ncasino had wrongfully sued him in Illinois for making false statements.\n\f                                    12\n\nId. at 245. Argosy voluntarily dismissed its Illinois lawsuit against Foley\n\nbefore trial. Id. Foley then sued Argosy in Iowa district court, alleging\n\nthat “as a result of the Illinois suit, [his] insurance carrier declined to\n\nrenew its policies and [he] lost financing on a real estate deal in\n\nSioux City.” Id. at 245–46. Foley also claimed the lawsuit “caused him\n\nstress, exacerbating preexisting neck and back pain.”         Id.   Argosy\n\nremoved the action to federal court and moved for summary judgment on\n\ngrounds that Foley failed to allege a recognized type of “special injury,”\n\nsuch as an arrest or seizure of property, required to recover under Iowa\n\nlaw. Id. at 246. The federal court certified four questions to our court\n\nasking whether the harm alleged by Foley was recoverable under Iowa\n\nlaw.   Id.   We observed that we first recognized the special injury\n\nrequirement in 1884 and had reaffirmed it in numerous decisions\n\nthereafter, most recently four years earlier. Id. at 246–47. Yet we noted\n\nFoley invited us to abandon the special-injury requirement. Id. at 247.\n\nWe proceeded to answer the certified questions, stating, “[O]ne may\n\nalways question whether a precedent is controlling by asking whether it\n\nremains the law; it is manifest that we are free to overrule precedents\n\nwhen circumstances warrant.”        Id. at 247.    We then applied our\n\nprecedent to answer the certified questions. Id. at 247–49.\n\n       As in Foley, the questions certified in this case can be answered by\n\napplying long-standing precedent first decided a century ago and\n\nreaffirmed repeatedly and as recently as four years ago.      We take the\n\nsame approach today as we did in Foley. The certifying court here, in its\n\nwisdom, defers to our judgment on whether the DMWW states a claim\n\nagainst the drainage districts under Iowa law. Revisiting our state law\n\nprecedent is our prerogative. See State v. Eichler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1270,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1680064\"><a href=\"/opinion/1680064/state-v-eichler/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (1957) (“If our previous holdings are to be overruled,\n\f                                   13\n\nwe should ordinarily prefer to do it ourselves.”). We elect to answer the\n\ncertified questions.\n\n      III. Analysis.\n\n      We begin our analysis by reviewing our well-settled precedent\n\nlimiting judicial relief against drainage districts to mandamus and\n\nrestricting constitutional challenges by public entities. We next explore\n\nour traditional adherence to precedent left intact by the legislature,\n\ntempered by our obligation to overrule decisions that are plainly\n\nerroneous or rendered obsolete by changing circumstances.        We then\n\naddress whether the DMWW’s claims warrant overruling our prior\n\ndecisions that recognize broad immunity for drainage districts and limit\n\nconstitutional challenges by public bodies.

Drainage\n\ndistricts have no other function, power, or purpose.              As the certifying\n\ncourt observed, “Drainage districts are something of a collective passive\n\nutility system.” The districts have accomplished their original statutory\n\nmission: The terrain in much of north central Iowa was too wet or\n\nswampy for growing row crops 4 until subsurface drain tiles were installed\n\nto “transform these lands into the productive farm land that exists\n\ntoday.”      Id. at 508.        The drainage districts now have a continuing\n\nstatutory duty to keep the drains working, that is, to maintain the\n\noriginal capacity of the drainage systems. See Iowa Code § 468.126(1)(a).\n\n      We reaffirmed our immunity precedent just four years ago to hold\n\nthat a railroad could not sue a drainage district for the railroad’s costs\n\nincurred repairing underground drainage tile. Chi. Cent. & Pac. R.R., 816\n\nN.W.2d at 378. The tile had collapsed, causing a sinkhole undermining\n\nthe railroad tracks.         Id. at 368.       The county board of supervisors, as\n\ntrustees for the drainage district, owed the statutory duty to maintain\n\ndrainage improvements in repair.                     Id. at 373 (citing Iowa Code\n\n§ 468.126(1)). After the county supervisors failed to fix the sinkhole, the\n\nrailroad made repairs to the drainage system at its expense and\n\ndemanded reimbursement.                   Id. at 369.      We held the railroad’s\n\nreimbursement claim failed as a matter of law, stating, “We see no reason\n\nto abandon our previous holdings that . . . mandamus is the proper\n\nremedy.” Id. at 374.\n\n\n\n      4It   is said that “corn doesn’t like wet feet.”\n\f                                    15\n\n      This has been our law for over one hundred years.

They filed a tort action seeking money damages from\n\f                                    16\n\nthe drainage district and the county board of supervisors, alleging\n\nnegligent inspection and maintenance of the drainage tile line. Id. The\n\ndistrict court ruled that neither the drainage district nor the board acting\n\non its behalf could be sued for money damages. Id. at 428. We affirmed,\n\nnoting the “limited nature of a drainage district’s purposes and powers”\n\nas the reason judicial relief is limited to mandamus actions to compel\n\nperformance of a statutory duty. Id. at 429, 430–31. We reiterated that\n\nwe have never permitted a drainage district to be sued “for money\n\ndamages on a tort theory for injury to land within the district” and\n\nrejected the plaintiffs’ argument that the legislature’s partial abrogation\n\nof sovereign immunity with the enactment of the Municipal Tort Claims\n\nAct, Iowa Code chapter 613A (now codified at Iowa Code chapter 670),\n\nopened the door to tort actions against a drainage district. Id. at 429–30.\n\nWe elaborated,\n\n            We do not agree that a drainage district’s immunity\n      from suit in tort must stand or fall with the doctrine of\n      sovereign immunity. Nothing in our prior cases suggests\n      that sovereign immunity was the reason for denial of the\n      right to sue a drainage district for money damages. The\n      language of the cases indicates that, apart from any question\n      of sovereign immunity, a drainage district is merely an area\n      of land, not an entity subject to a judgment for tort damages.\n             This was never the case with such governmental\n      entities as cities or counties. Even before the enactment of\n      chapter 613A, a city could be sued for torts committed in a\n      proprietary, as opposed to governmental, capacity.         In\n      contrast, a drainage district could not be subject to a money\n      judgment in tort under any state of facts.\n\nId. at 430 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). We expressly held that “a\n\ndrainage district is not a ‘municipality’ within the meaning of Iowa Code\n\nsection 613A.1(1). A drainage district is not subject to suit in tort for\n\nmoney damages.” Id.\n\f                                     17\n\n      A decade later, in Gard, we declined to overrule Fisher and rejected\n\nan equal protection challenge to drainage district immunity. 521 N.W.2d\n\nat 698–99. We affirmed the dismissal of a wrongful-death action arising\n\nfrom a fatal boat accident blamed on an underwater obstruction allegedly\n\nmaintained by the drainage district. Id. at 697, 699. We noted after our\n\ndecision in Fisher, the legislature did not amend the Municipal Tort\n\nClaims Act to include drainage districts within the definition of\n\nmunicipalities subject to tort claims.      Id. at 698.    We “invoked the\n\nprinciple that issues of statutory interpretation settled by the court and\n\nnot disturbed by the legislature have become tacitly accepted by the\n\nlegislature.” Id. Accordingly, we applied the doctrine of stare decisis. Id.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued this resulted in a violation of equal protection under\n\nthe Federal and Iowa Constitutions by creating separate classes of\n\nvictims: (1) persons injured by drainage districts who could not sue; and\n\n(2) persons injured by other local government entities who could sue. Id.\n\nat 698–99.     But we rejected the constitutional challenge, stating,\n\n“Because of the limited nature of a drainage district’s purposes and\n\npowers, there is a rational basis for the classification.” Id. at 699.\n\n      Again in 2012, we reiterated our interpretation of chapter 468\n\nprecluding claims for money damages and limiting judicial relief to\n\nmandamus. Chi. Cent. & Pac. R.R., 816 N.W.2d at 374. “Suits against\n\ndrainage districts ‘have been allowed only to compel, complete, or correct\n\nthe performance of a duty or the exercise of a power by those acting on\n\nbehalf of a drainage district.’ ” Id. at 378 (quoting Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at\n\n429). We saw “no reason to abandon our previous holdings” particularly\n\ngiven the legislature’s inaction, “indicating its tacit acceptance of\n\nmandamus as the appropriate remedy for board inaction.” Id. at 374.\n\nOur decision was unanimous, with one justice not participating.\n\f                                    18\n\n      We have long made clear that mandamus is the proper remedy to\n\nadjudicate claims that a drainage district is violating a duty imposed by\n\nan Iowa statute.

McElroy, 703 N.W.2d at 395. Our\n\ncourt was narrowly divided in Smith, with four justices dissenting. Id. at\n\n393–94 (citing Smith, 456 N.W.2d at 387–88 (Carter, J., dissenting)). We\n\nobserved that the Smith dissent predicted problems resulting from the\n\nmajority’s interpretation that experience revealed in practice and that\n\f                                         22\n\nsubsequent changes in federal law “compounded the problems the\n\ndissent foretold.” Id. at 394. By contrast, our prior holdings that the\n\nDMWW seeks to overturn were unanimously reaffirmed by our court in\n\n1994 and 2012 without any intervening changes in the law underlying\n\nthe immunity.\n\n         C. DMWW’s Arguments for Revisiting Our Precedent. We next\n\naddress whether DMWW has provided compelling reasons for overruling\n\nour century of precedent interpreting chapter 468 that the legislature\n\nhas left intact. DMWW raises several arguments in this regard. First,\n\nDMWW argues immunity should not apply in a water pollution case in\n\nlight    of   the   evolution   in    the   understanding   of   environmental\n\ncontamination.       Second, it contends the enactment of the home rule\n\namendment to our state constitution in 1978 undermines the rationale\n\nfor the immunity.       Third, it claims the nitrate contamination at issue\n\nrebuts the public health rationale for drainage districts. Fourth, it points\n\nto decisions of other states allowing tort claims against drainage\n\ndistricts. Finally, it argues the immunity is unconstitutional as applied.\n\nWe address these arguments in turn.\n\n         1. The evolution of environmental law. The DMWW notes that none\n\nof our drainage district immunity decisions involved a claim for water\n\npollution.       According to DMWW, immunity was established decades\n\nbefore     the    environmental      movement   raised   consciousness   about\n\nprotecting water quality. Thus, the DMWW argues the historical basis\n\nfor immunity does not apply to pollution claims.\n\n         Upon our review, we disagree.        Changes in environmental laws\n\nhave not undermined the basis for the immunity—the limited scope and\n\npowers of drainage districts as entities. Our cases, old and new, closed\n\nthe door to tort claims against drainage districts “under any state of\n\f                                     23\n\nfacts.” Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 430. We applied the immunity in Fisher\n\neven though the drainage district in that case breached its statutory duty\n\nto maintain and repair the underground drain tile line, causing the\n\nrecurring floods in the plaintiff homeowner’s basement. Id. at 427–28.\n\nWe again applied the immunity four years ago, unanimously rejecting a\n\nrailroad’s reimbursement claim for repairing a blocked tile drain that the\n\ndrainage district was statutorily obligated to maintain. Chi. Cent. & Pac.\n\nR.R., 816 N.W.2d at 374. In both cases, we reaffirmed drainage district\n\nimmunity even though the harm to the plaintiff resulted from the\n\ndrainage district’s breach of its statutory duty to repair drain tiles.\n\n      Pollution claims do not present a stronger case to impose liability.\n\nChapter 468 imposes no duty on the districts to filter out nitrates.\n\nRather, chapter 468 simply requires drainage districts to maintain\n\ndrainage systems to keep the water flowing to drain lands.          See, e.g.,\n\nIowa Code § 468.126(1)(a) (requiring repairs as necessary to “restore or\n\nmaintain a drainage . . . improvement in its original efficiency or\n\ncapacity”). No provision in chapter 468 authorizes drainage districts to\n\nmandate changes in farming practices to reduce fertilizer runoff or to\n\nassess farmers for the costs of removing nitrates from waters flowing\n\nthrough agricultural drainage systems. It would therefore seem odd to\n\nmake an exception to drainage district immunity in this one area.\n\n      The defendants’ lack of statutory authority to regulate farmer\n\nnitrate use cuts against revisiting our long-standing precedent, which\n\nrests upon the limited existence and powers of drainage districts.\n\n“Liability follows control . . . .” Estate of McFarlin v.

Those tort claims have coexisted\n\nwith drainage district immunity, weakening the DMWW’s argument that\n\nchanges in environmental laws support abrogating that immunity.\n\n      In Freeman, we noted “the 1960s and 1970s saw the development\n\nof significant statutory approaches to pollution.”     848 N.W.2d at 68.\n\nThese included the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and Clean Water Act\n\n(CWA) as well as Iowa Code chapter 455B, the state counterpart to those\n\nenactments.

Yet this proliferation of environmental laws has not led us\n\nor the legislature to revisit our precedent limiting judicial remedies\n\nagainst drainage districts.\n\n      Significantly, Iowa Code section 455E.6 expressly immunizes\n\nfarmers who comply with fertilizer label instructions from liability for\n\nnitrate contamination, including money damage claims or cleanup\n\f                                          26\n\ncosts. 5 We defer to the legislature whether to reassess that policy choice.\n\nSee Galloway v.

With that\n\nstatutory immunity for nitrate costs on the books, it is difficult to argue\n\nour precedents immunizing drainage districts should be overruled.\n\nIndeed, because farmers are assessed for the costs of drainage districts,\n\none might characterize state-law nitrate-based claims against drainage\n\ndistricts as a way to get backdoor relief against farmers that the\n\nlegislature has specifically barred through the front door.\n\n      Drainage districts provide a conduit for draining water. In other\n\ncontexts, the legislature has imposed cleanup obligations on entities\n\noperating conduits carrying contaminated water.                 See, e.g., Iowa Code\n\n      5Iowa   Code section 455E.6 provides,\n              This chapter supplements other legal authority and shall not\n      enlarge, restrict, or abrogate any remedy which any person or class of\n      persons may have under other statutory or common law and which\n      serves the purpose of groundwater protection. An activity that does not\n      violate chapter 455B or 459, subchapters II and III, does not violate this\n      chapter. In the event of a conflict between this section and another\n      provision of this chapter, it is the intent of the general assembly that this\n      section prevails.\n              Liability shall not be imposed upon an agricultural producer for\n      the costs of active cleanup, or for any damages associated with or\n      resulting from the detection in the groundwater of any quantity of\n      nitrates provided that application has been in compliance with soil test\n      results and that the applicator has properly complied with label\n      instructions for application of the fertilizer. Compliance with the above\n      provisions may be raised as an affirmative defense by an agricultural\n      producer.\n              Liability shall not be imposed upon an agricultural producer for\n      costs of active cleanup, or for any damages associated with or resulting\n      from the detection in the groundwater of pesticide provided that the\n      applicator has properly complied with label instructions for application of\n      the pesticide and that the applicator has a valid appropriate applicator’s\n      license. Compliance with the above provisions may be raised as an\n      affirmative defense by an agricultural producer.\n\f                                         27\n\n§ 358.16 (providing sanitary districts with the power to provide for\n\nsewage disposal); id. § 455B.307 (prohibiting dumping solid waste into\n\nany place other than sanitary disposal project); see also id. § 455B.186\n\n(“A pollutant shall not be disposed of by dumping, depositing, or\n\ndischarging such pollutant into any water of the state . . . except . . .\n\nadequately treated sewage . . . .”); id. § 455B.173 (instructing agency to\n\nset forth water standards for sewage systems and waterworks); Iowa\n\nAdmin. Code r. 567—62.3 (setting forth treatment standards for publicly\n\nowned treatment works and sewage disposal systems).                  This indicates\n\nour legislature has responded to changing environmental attitudes.\n\nUnlike with sanitary districts, the Iowa legislature has not imposed\n\nduties on drainage districts to treat contaminants. 6\n\n       “[A] drainage district is a legislative creation which has no rights or\n\npowers other than those found in statutes which give and sustain its\n\nlife.” State ex rel. Iowa Emp’t Sec. Comm’n, 260 Iowa at 345, 149 N.W.2d\n\nat 291. Iowa Code chapter 468 empowers drainage districts to\n\n       restore or maintain a drainage or levee improvement in its\n       original efficiency or capacity, and for that purpose may\n       remove silt, debris, repair any damaged structures, remove\n       weeds and other vegetable growth, and whatever else may be\n       needed to restore or maintain such efficiency or capacity to\n       prolong its useful life.\n\nIowa Code § 468.126(1)(a) (emphasis added). An improvement is further\n\ndefined as “a project intended to expand, enlarge, or otherwise increase\n\nthe capacity of any existing ditch, drain, or other facility above that for\n\n\n        6The fact the CWA expressly exempts agricultural runoff further undermines the\n\nview that changing environmental attitudes warrants revisiting our precedent on\ndrainage district immunity. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(14) (defining “point source” to exclude\n“agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture”). No\ncourt or agency to date has ruled agricultural drainage systems constitute point\nsources regulated under the CWA.\n\f                                           28\n\nwhich it was designed.”           Id. § 468.126(4).      Thus, under the express\n\nlanguage of the statute, the drainage district is empowered only to\n\n“restore,” “maintain,” or “increase” the flow of water through the drainage\n\nsystem.      Id. § 468.126(1), (4).        The legislature has not authorized\n\ndrainage districts to assess costs to redesign existing drainage systems to\n\nabate nitrates. This further supports our conclusion that the changing\n\nenvironmental attitudes should not undermine our long-standing\n\nprecedents limiting judicial relief against drainage districts.\n\n       Drainage districts and their trustees have presumably relied on\n\nour long-standing precedent recognizing their immunity. One practical\n\nresult of that reliance is the lack of liability insurance to cover defense\n\ncosts or indemnify judgments. 7             Perhaps some citizens would have\n\ndeclined to serve as drainage district trustees if they knew they could\n\nface uninsured litigation liability.        Public property, including funds in\n\nbank accounts necessary for the general purpose of the public entity, is\n\nexempt from execution. See Reg’l Util. Serv. Sys. v.

By contrast, other statutes\n\nallow cities and counties to raise taxes to pay off judgments. 8                    If the\n\nlegislature had intended to allow tort claims against drainage districts, it\n\npresumably       would     have    provided      a   funding     mechanism        to   pay\n\njudgments, as it did for cities and counties. 9 The absence of such a\n\nprovision in chapter 468 reinforces our long-standing interpretation\n\nprecluding tort claims against drainage districts under any set of facts.\n\n       Another reason to decline the DMWW’s invitation to abrogate\n\nimmunity for pollution claims is the absence of any evidence or argument\n\nthat drainage districts are the cheapest cost avoider for nitrate\n\ncontamination. The drainage systems were not designed or intended to\n\nfilter out nitrates. DMWW does not suggest it would be cheaper for the\n\ndrainage districts to remove nitrates from multiple locations than for\n\n\n       8Iowa Code section 626.24 authorizes cities to levy taxes to pay off judgments,\nand provides in relevant part,\n       If no property of a municipal corporation again which execution has\n       issued can be found, or if the judgment creditor elects not to issue\n       execution against such corporation, a tax must be levied as early as\n       practicable to pay off the judgment.\nSee also Iowa Code § 331.430 (authorizing debt service funded by county to pay\njudgments). There are no such statutory provisions allowing drainage districts to levy\ntaxes to pay tort judgments.\n         9As counsel for the DMWW acknowledged at oral argument, further litigation\n\nwould be required to allocate liability among numerous drainage districts. Such cost\nsharing could be further complicated by remonstrance petitions objecting to a drainage\ndistrict’s tax assessments. See Iowa Code § 468.126(4)(c). By contrast, the DMWW can\nspread its cost of nitrate removal by raising its water rates. The Illinois Supreme Court\naptly observed that when “a system already exists for the rational allocation of costs . . .\nthere is little reason for a court to impose an entirely new system of allocation.” Beretta\nU.S.A.

The least-cost avoider for removing nitrates from\n\ndrinking water may well be the DMWW, which already bears the\n\nstatutory obligation to provide safe water for its customers under the\n\nSafe Drinking Water Act and its Amendments, 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f–300j.\n\nThe DMWW does not claim otherwise and, indeed, itself at times has\n\nlawfully deposited back into the Raccoon River the very nitrates it\n\nremoved. 10\n\n      The argument has been made that “case-by-case adjudication” by\n\nthe Iowa courts is superior to “legislatively imposed command and\n\ncontrol regulation.”   We do not share that view.      Affected parties are\n\nbeing subjected to “commands” and “controls” whether these come from\n\na legislature, regulatory agency, or a court. The difference is that statutes\n\n\n      10Iowa Dep’t Nat. Res., National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\n\n(NPDES) Permit No. 7727000, at 3 (May 1, 2015).\n\f                                      31\n\nand regulations have been approved by one or more elected branches of\n\ngovernment who are responsible to the people. Also, these statutes and\n\nregulations usually have been developed by parties with expertise, rather\n\nthan generalist judges. And they are enacted and published in advance\n\nso the public knows what the rules are. Case-by-case adjudication, on\n\nthe other hand, offers none of those advantages.\n\n        The Supreme Court, in a decision holding the CAA supplanted\n\nfederal common law claims asserted by several states and private parties\n\nsuing    over    power   plant   emissions,    compared    the   institutional\n\ncompetency of courts and regulators in addressing pollution as follows:\n\n              It is altogether fitting that Congress designated an\n        expert agency, here, EPA, as the best suited to serve as\n        primary regulator of greenhouse gas emissions. The expert\n        agency is surely better equipped to do the job than\n        individual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case\n        injunctions. Federal judges lack scientific, economic, and\n        technological resources an agency can utilize in coping with\n        issues of this order. Judges may not commission scientific\n        studies or convene groups of experts for advice, or issue\n        rules under notice-and-comment procedures inviting input\n        by any interested person, or seek the counsel of regulators in\n        the States where the defendants are located. Rather, judges\n        are confined by a record comprising the evidence the parties\n        present.\n\nAm. Elec. Power Co., 564 U.S. at 428, 131 S. Ct. at 2539–40, 180\n\nL.

The home rule amendment.           The DMWW next argues the\n\nenactment of the home rule amendment in 1978 broadened the police\n\npowers of county government. That amendment granted counties “home\n\nrule power and authority, not inconsistent with the laws of the general\n\nassembly.”      Iowa Const. art. III, § 39A; see also Worth Cty.

City of\n\nDes Moines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2069345\"><a href=\"/opinion/2069345/bechtel-v-city-of-des-moines/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332 (Iowa 1975))). Iowa Code chapter 468,\n\nhowever, remained unchanged.               This case turns on the duties and\n\npowers of drainage districts.        The county supervisors merely act in a\n\nrepresentative capacity as trustees of the drainage districts under\n\nchapter 468.         Nothing in the home rule amendment broadens the\n\nsupervisors’ operational authority over drainage districts or gives\n\ndrainage districts the power to regulate farming practices or water\n\nquality.     We have repeatedly reaffirmed the immunity of drainage\n\ndistricts well after the enactment of the home rule amendment because\n\ndrainage districts have limited powers. See Chi. Cent. & Pac. R.R., 816\n\nN.W.2d at 374; Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 430. Drainage districts lack the\n\nbroad      police    powers    exercised    by     counties   and   other   political\n\nsubdivisions.\n\n        Home rule powers can only be exercised in a manner consistent\n\nwith acts of the general assembly.          See Iowa Const. art. III, § 39A.       A\n\nstate statute trumps inconsistent local acts. The DMWW’s position that\n\nthe home rule amendment abrogated drainage district immunity conflicts\n\nwith chapter 468 as we have interpreted it for over a century.                  That\n\nprovides another reason for declining to read into the home rule\n\namendment any intent to overrule our statutory interpretation of chapter\n\n468 immunizing drainage districts.\n\n        We    also    note    the   home    rule     amendment      prohibits   local\n\ngovernments from assessing taxes without legislative authorization. Id.\n\n(“Counties . . . shall not have power to levy any tax unless expressly\n\nauthorized by the general assembly.”).              The legislature has expressly\n\nallowed counties to levy taxes to pay off tort judgments. See Iowa Code\n\f                                     33\n\n§ 626.24. No such provision allows drainage districts to levy taxes to pay\n\noff tort judgments. The legislature has authorized drainage districts to\n\nlevy taxes solely to construct and maintain drainage systems to drain\n\nwater.   Id. § 468.127.   The limited powers of drainage districts have\n\nremained unchanged since the enactment of the home rule amendment.\n\n       3. Public health. The DMWW also contends that its allegations of\n\nnitrate contamination should eliminate the historical immunity of\n\ndrainage districts because they rebut the statutory purpose of drainage\n\ndistricts to benefit “public health.”     It is true that Iowa Code section\n\n468.2 codifies a legislative presumption that the “drainage from\n\nagricultural lands . . . shall be presumed to be a public benefit and\n\nconducive to the public health, convenience, and welfare.” Id. § 468.2(1).\n\nWe draw a different lesson from that language, however, than DMWW.\n\nThe legislature having adopted a legislative presumption that drainage\n\ndistricts are beneficial, it is not our role to adopt a different presumption.\n\nFurther, DMWW disregards two additional benefits of draining lands\n\npresumed by the legislature—the public’s “convenience[] and welfare.”\n\nId.   Drainage districts convert economically unproductive swamps into\n\ntillable farmland.\n\n       Ultimately, this case is about who pays for nitrate removal from\n\nthe drinking water that reaches our kitchen faucets. The DMWW does\n\nnot claim nitrate levels render the Raccoon River unsafe for swimming or\n\nfishing. All parties agree the DMWW removes unsafe levels of nitrates\n\nfrom the water it provides to its customers.       The resulting cost to its\n\ncustomers, according to defendants, is about one cent per day added to\n\ntheir water bills. The DMWW does not challenge that estimate. It is for\n\nthe legislature to decide whether to reallocate the costs of nitrate\n\nreduction. See In re Estate of Whalen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (Iowa 2013)\n\f                                   34\n\n(declining to change the meaning of a statute in the guise of\n\ninterpretation and suggesting policy arguments for the change be\n\ndirected to the legislature).\n\n      4. The decisions of other state courts. The DMWW cites decisions\n\nfrom a handful of states allowing private persons to sue drainage\n\ndistricts in tort. None involved claims by a water utility or other public\n\nentity. Roark v.

Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 430. We\n\nalso have held that drainage districts are not municipalities subject to\n\nsuit under Iowa’s Municipal Tort Claims Act.      Id.   That other states\n\f                                           35\n\npermit tort claims against drainage districts does not persuade us to\n\noverrule our holdings to the contrary.\n       5. The constitutionality of broad immunity for drainage districts.\n\nThe DMWW lastly argues broad immunity in favor of drainage districts is\n\nunconstitutional. We have confronted this argument before. In Gard, we\n\napplied the rational-basis test 11 and rejected state and federal equal\n\nprotection challenges to drainage district immunity from tort liability.\n\n521 N.W.2d at 698–99. We denied recovery to the families of two boaters\n\nwho died when their watercraft struck an underwater concrete deflector\n\njointly maintained by the drainage district in the Little Sioux River. Id. at\n\n697. We are not persuaded the DMWW’s claims over the cost of treating\n\ndrinking water are more compelling than the wrongful-death claims at\n\nissue in Gard. We apply Gard to reject the DMWW’s equal protection\n\nclaims.\n\n       We also reject the DMWW’s “takings” claim.                 The takings clause\n\nprovides, “Private property shall not be taken for public use without just\n\ncompensation first being made . . . .” Iowa Const. art. I, § 18 (emphasis\n\nadded). No private property is involved in this case. To the contrary, we\n\nhave a dispute among various public subdivisions that only exist by the\n\ngrace of the Iowa General Assembly.\n\n       The drainage districts have not unconstitutionally deprived the\n\nDMWW of any property. The Raccoon River is owned by the State of Iowa\n\nin trust for the public. See Estate of McFarlin, 881 N.W.2d at 63. The\n\n\n        11The DMWW argues we should apply strict scrutiny, but fails to cite any\n\nauthority applying strict scrutiny to a constitutional claim asserted by one public entity\nagainst another. Strict scrutiny is unwarranted when reviewing claims challenging a\nstate’s allocation of authority among political subdivisions. Herriman v.

Sac Cty. Bd. of Supervisors\n\nCADY, Chief Justice (concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I join in the partial concurrence and dissent by Justice Appel. I\n\nwrite separately to build upon an important point of this federal litigation\n\nand to add another.\n\n      The role of this court is not to decide the outcome of the case, but\n\nto determine if the basis of the lawsuit is supported by our state law. It\n\nis abundantly clear that Iowa’s drainage district law did not originate and\n\nwas not developed over time with the thought that a drainage district\n\ncould be a polluter.     If it had, I am convinced our law would have\n\ndeveloped in a way that would have recognized a clear remedy.\n\n      Nevertheless, the equitable remedies now asserted are not new to\n\nour law; they are only difficult to see in the context of this case. That\n\ndifficulty is not, however, a reason to dismiss the case, especially when\n\nthe facts in evidence have not yet been presented. The seriousness of\n\nfacts can often help to see the             availability of equitable relief.\n\nFurthermore,    law   develops    through    our   changed   understanding,\n\nincluding our understanding of the environmental impact of drainage\n\ndistricts. One of the fundamental principles of law is for remedies to be\n\navailable when we discover wrongs. Pollution of our streams is a wrong,\n\nirrespective of its source or its cause.\n\n      I believe the focus of our attention should be the end to which this\n\nlawsuit is directed. This state is blessed with fertile soil, vast expanses of\n\nteeming wilderness, and an overwhelming abundance of fresh water. The\n\nrole and purpose of drainage districts in Iowa is important, but no more\n\nimportant than this state’s enduring role of good stewardship.           This\n\nlawsuit serves to reinforce the critical balance at stake and asks the\n\f                                       43\n\nrhetorical question posited years ago by one of the founders of modern\n\nconservation, “What good is an undrained marsh anyhow?” 15 We should\n\nrespond when this balance has shifted too far in either direction.\n\n      The law of this state is but a reflection of the values of its people.\n\nAs we go forward as a people, so too must the law advance our values.\n\nWe can do this by applying existing remedies in new ways or by applying\n\nnew remedies to our existing values.         This concept of remedy is not\n\nexclusive to the judicial branch. We all can engage in this discussion\n\nand act. As every farmer knows, the work is never done.\n\n      For these reasons and for the reasons stated by Justice Appel, I\n\nconcur in part and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n     15Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There 100 (Spec.\n\nCommemorative ed. 1989).

Bd. of Supervisors\n\nAPPEL, Justice (concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I cannot join the majority opinion.    Nonetheless, for the reasons\n\nexpressed below, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n      I. Introduction.\n\n      A. What Is Presented: Significant Issues—Ghosts and Goblins.\n\nThis case touches upon some difficult and profound issues in our law.\n\nThese issues include the nature of riparian water rights, the proper\n\napproach, if any, to controlling pollution of rivers and streams as a result\n\nof common agricultural practices, and the ability of a government\n\nsubdivision to assert claims based on allegations of water pollution\n\nagainst another governmental subdivision.\n\n      For purposes of this case I, like the majority, assume the facts that\n\nhave been provided to us by the federal district court in this certified\n\nquestion matter. Under the district court’s certification order, we are to\n\nassume that the defendant drainage districts are collecting agricultural\n\nrunoff that is then discharged into the Raccoon River and that the runoff\n\nis so polluted with nitrates that the water withdrawn by the Des Moines\n\nWater Works (DMWW) does not meet the health and safety standards of\n\nthe Safe Drinking Water Act as amended. See 42 U.S.C. § 300g-1 (2012).\n\nAs a result of the noncompliance, the DMWW expends significant funds\n\nto remove the nitrates from the water before the water is sold to its\n\ncustomers.   DMWW seeks to recover damages for past cleanup efforts\n\nand an injunction to prevent the defendants from continuing to pollute\n\nthe Raccoon River in the future.\n\n      To consider the issues, I first explore the contours of our law\n\nrelated to drainage districts.   Taking the facts provided by the federal\n\ndistrict court as true, I then consider whether money damages are\n\f                                    45\n\navailable under our caselaw and applicable statutes.       I then consider\n\nwhether any alleged limitation in the power of drainage districts to pay\n\nmoney damages gives rise to a state constitutional claim rooted in the\n\ndue process, equal protection, or inalienable rights clauses of the Iowa\n\nConstitution.    I thereafter explore the law or remedies as well as the\n\nsubstance of the law of nuisance.\n\n         Finally, I consider whether DMWW may bring a takings claim\n\nagainst the defendants because of its alleged pollution of the Raccoon\n\nRiver.    I consider whether property interests are involved, whether the\n\nproperty interests are “private” for the purposes of takings law, and\n\nwhether DMWW has standing to bring a takings claim against the\n\ndrainage district defendants.\n\n         B. What Is Not Presented: False Trails.     Before launching into\n\nthe substantive analysis, it is important to emphasize what this case is\n\nnot about. It raises no question about who owns the water—all agree\n\nthat the state owns the water. See Iowa Code § 455B.171(39) (2015). It\n\nraises no question of navigation rights. See Gibson v.

In short, this is a\n\npollution case.\n\n     II. Setting the Table: Overview of Drainage District and\nNuisance Law.\n\n      A. Introduction. Before diving into the issues, it is important to\n\nhave a bird’s-eye overview of the relevant law. I begin by surveying the\n\nconstitutional environment as the starting point for consideration of the\n\nissues raised in this case.    I next turn to the statutory environment,\n\nincluding not only the statutory framework for drainage districts but the\n\nstatutory provisions related to nuisance and water pollution.         These\n\nstatutory provisions are important because the interrelationship between\n\nenvironmental law and drainage district law is at the heart of this case.\n\nFinally, I briefly review the common law of nuisance, which is not\n\npreempted by either statutory nuisance or any other environmental\n\nstatute.\n\n      B. Constitutional Environment.\n\n      1. Article I, section 18: Authorization of drainage districts. Drainage\n\ndistricts are authorized by the eminent domain article of the Iowa\n\nConstitution.     This constitutional provision authorizes the general\n\nassembly to\n\n      pass laws permitting the owners of lands to construct\n      drains, ditches, and levees for agricultural . . . purposes\n      across the lands of others, and provide for the organization\n      of drainage districts, vest the proper authorities with power\n      to construct and maintain levees, drains and ditches and to\n      keep in repair all drains, ditches, and levees heretofore\n      constructed under the laws of the state, by special\n      assessments upon the property benefited thereby.\n\nIowa Const. art. I, § 18.\n\n      Further, article I, section 18 provides for condemnation powers for\n\ndrainage districts: “The general assembly may provide by law for the\n\f                                     47\n\ncondemnation of such real estate as shall be necessary for the\n\nconstruction and maintenance of such drains, ditches and levees, and\n\nprescribe the method of making such condemnation.” Id.\n\n      2. Article III, section 39A: County home rule.    In 1978, the Iowa\n\nConstitution was amended to provide for county home rule. Specifically,\n\narticle III, section 39A provides,\n\n      Counties or joint county-municipal corporation governments\n      are granted home rule power and authority, not inconsistent\n      with the laws of the general assembly, to determine their\n      local affairs and government, except that they shall not have\n      power to levy any tax unless expressly authorized by the\n      general assembly. . . .\n\n             ....\n\n            The proposition or rule of law that a county or joint\n      county-municipal corporation government possesses and\n      can exercise only those powers granted in express words is\n      not a part of the law of this state.\n\nIowa Const. art. III, § 39A.    This constitutional provision is important\n\nbecause it has potential application to a key issue in this case, namely,\n\nthe scope of power of drainage districts.\n\n      C. Iowa Statutory Environment.\n\n      1. Iowa Code chapter 468: The drainage district framework.       An\n\nelaborate and detailed statutory framework for drainage districts is\n\ncodified in Iowa Code chapter 468.        Under chapter 468, the board of\n\nsupervisors of a county is authorized to create a drainage district and\n\n“cause to be constructed” within the drainage district “any levee, ditch,\n\ndrain, or watercourse, or settling basins” and “to straighten, widen,\n\ndeepen, or change any natural watercourse” whenever such action will\n\nbe “of public utility or conducive to the public health, convenience or\n\nwelfare.” Iowa Code § 468.1.\n\f                                     48\n\n      Iowa Code section 468.2 further provides that the drainage of\n\nsurface waters from agricultural lands and other lands or the protection\n\nof lands from overflow is “presumed to be a public benefit and conducive\n\nto the public health, convenience, and welfare.”        The legislature has\n\ndirected that the provisions of laws related to drainage and protection\n\nfrom overflow “shall be liberally construed to promote leveeing, ditching,\n\ndraining, and reclamation of wet, swampy, and overflow lands.”          Id.\n\n§ 468.2(2).\n\n      The statute provides for the appointment of commissioners to\n\napportion and assess the costs and expenses of constructing proposed\n\nimprovements. Id. § 468.38. When the board of supervisors has finally\n\ndetermined the matter of assessments of benefits and apportionment for\n\ndrainage district improvements, the board is given the power to levy the\n\nassessments as fixed by it upon lands within the district. Id. § 468.50.\n\nThe law provides that such taxes “shall be paid out only for purposes\n\nproperly connected with and growing out of the county drainage and\n\nlevee districts on order of the board.” Id. § 468.54.\n\n      After a drainage district has been created and improvements\n\nconstructed, the statute authorizes repairs and additional improvements.\n\nWith respect to repairs, the board is authorized\n\n      to restore or maintain a drainage or levee improvement in its\n      original efficiency or capacity, . . . repair any damaged\n      structures, remove weeds and other vegetable growth, and\n      whatever else may be needed to restore or maintain such\n      efficiency or capacity or to prolong its useful life.\n\nId. § 468.126(1)(a).\n\n      The board is also authorized to construct improvements.           Id.\n\n§ 468.126(4). The term “improvement” is defined as “a project intended\n\nto expand, enlarge, or otherwise increase the capacity of any existing\n\f                                    49\n\nditch, drain, or other facility above that for which it was designed.” Id.\n\nCosts of improvements are to be paid out of drainage district funds or, if\n\nfunds are not sufficient, from assessments on land. Id. §§ 468.127, .147.\n\nThe assessments must be made at one time, but may be collected in\n\ninstallments.    Id. § 468.127.     In cases when current funds are\n\ninsufficient and the improvement cannot be funded by a single year’s\n\nlevy, the board may issue drainage bonds to finance the improvements.\n\nId. § 468.74.\n\n      Chapter 468 does not contain a provision that addresses potential\n\npollution arising from the operation of drainage districts.    There is a\n\nprovision in current law related to nuisance from overflow:\n\n            Any ditch, drain, or watercourse which is now or\n      hereafter may be constructed so as to prevent the surface\n      and overflow water from the adjacent lands from entering\n      and draining into and through the same is hereby declared a\n      nuisance and may be abated as such.\n\nId. § 468.150.\n\n      Notably, there are no provisions in chapter 468 specifically\n\ndeclaring that money damages may not be paid by a drainage district.\n\nFurther, there are no provisions expressly stating that generally\n\napplicable nuisance law does not apply against a drainage district.\n\nIndeed, there are no provisions of Iowa Code chapter 468 expressly\n\nexempting drainage districts from provisions of law germane to this case.\n\n      2. Iowa Code chapters 455A and B. Iowa Code chapters 455A and\n\nB provide the framework for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe purpose for creating the department is to protect “Iowa’s air, soils,\n\nwaters, and rich diversity of life” because “[t]he well-being and future of\n\nIowa depend on these natural resources.” Id. § 455A.15. The general\n\nassembly found “[t]here has been a significant deterioration in the quality\n\f                                    50\n\nof Iowa’s surface waters and groundwaters” because of human activity.\n\nId.; see also id. § 455B.262 (describing the importance to the state of\n\nprotecting “life and property from floods” and “the orderly development,\n\nwise use, protection, and conservation of the water resources of the\n\nstate”).\n\n       In order to accomplish this goal, the department “has the primary\n\nresponsibility for . . . managing fish, wildlife, and land and water\n\nresources in this state.” Id. § 455A.2; see also id. § 455A.16 (describing\n\nthe policy of the state of Iowa to protect Iowa’s waters, among other\n\nnatural resources, for the benefit of present and future citizens). The\n\ndirector of the department is required to cooperate with the Department\n\nof Agriculture and Land Stewardship in the “administration of programs\n\nrelating to water quality improvement and watershed improvements.” Id.\n\n§ 455A.4(1)(j).   The Environmental Protection Commission, created by\n\nIowa Code section 455A.6, is required to protect Iowa’s groundwater and\n\nwater supply and is directed to cooperate with “cities and other\n\nsubdivisions of the state” as well as landowners in actions “relating to\n\nflood control and the use of water resources.” Id. § 455B.263(7).\n\n       3. Iowa Code chapter 657: Statutory nuisance. Iowa Code section\n\n657.1 provides for a statutory nuisance civil action. Among other things,\n\nthis section states,\n\n       Whatever is injurious to health, indecent, or unreasonably\n       offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of\n       property . . . is a nuisance, and a civil action by ordinary\n       proceedings may be brought to enjoin and abate the\n       nuisance and to recover damages sustained on account of\n       the nuisance.\n\nId. § 657.1. Iowa Code section 657.2 then lists a number of actions or\n\nsituations that are nuisances under the chapter.         In particular, a\n\nnuisance includes “[t]he corrupting or rendering unwholesome or impure\n\f                                    51\n\nthe water of any river, stream, or pond, or unlawfully diverting the same\n\nfrom its natural course or state, to the injury or prejudice of others.” Id.\n\n§ 657.2(4).\n\n      Iowa Code section 657.3 provides criminal penalties related to\n\nnuisances:\n\n            Whoever is convicted of erecting, causing, or\n      continuing a public or common nuisance as provided in this\n      chapter, or at common law . . . , where no other punishment\n      therefor is specially provided, shall be guilty of an aggravated\n      misdemeanor and the court may order such nuisance\n      abated, and issue a warrant . . . .\n\n      Finally, chapter 657 provides for a process including the issuance\n\nof warrants to cause abatement of nuisances and describes how the\n\ncosts of abating a nuisance may be collected. Id. §§ 657.6–.7.\n\n      Chapter 657 provides a safe harbor for animal agricultural\n\nproducers who manage their operations in accordance with state or\n\nfederal law.   Id. § 657.11(1).    Aside from the exception for animal\n\nagricultural producers, there is no other agriculturally related exemption\n\nfrom nuisance law in Iowa Code chapter 657.         In Gacke v. Pork Xtra,\n\nL.L.C., however, we held that this exception was unconstitutional as a\n\nper se taking without just compensation.      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2107625\"><a href=\"/opinion/2107625/gacke-v-pork-xtra-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185 (Iowa\n\n2004).\n\n      D. Iowa Common Law Environment.                 We have held that\n\nstatutory nuisance does not preempt a common law nuisance action.\n\nFreeman v.

Thus, in addition to the statutory nuisance described in Iowa\n\nCode chapter 657, a common law claim remains available to persons\n\nalleging environmental harms. The elements of common law nuisance\n\nare “(1) unlawful or anti-social conduct that (2) in some way injures (3) a\n\f                                     52\n\nsubstantial number of people” for public nuisance and “an actionable\n\ninterference with a person’s interest in the private use and enjoyment of\n\nhis land” for private nuisance.

More Table Setting: Iowa Caselaw Involving Drainage\nDistricts and Environmental Regulation.\n\n      A. Introduction. I now turn to the caselaw related to drainage\n\ndistricts.   First, I examine the opinions on the nature of drainage\n\ndistricts and their powers. I then explore the cases regarding the legal\n\nduties of drainage districts that arise both within Iowa Code chapter 468\n\nand from external sources. Finally, I consider the caselaw applying the\n\nlaw of nuisance to agricultural concerns.\n\n      B. The Rise (and Fall) of “No Legal Entity” Theory. The older\n\nnotion that a drainage district is a nonjuristic entity is reflected in Clary\n\nv. Woodbury County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1907). In that case,\n\nwe declared\n\n      [a drainage district] is not a person or a corporation. It is\n      nothing more than a definite body or district of land\n      constituting an improvement district. That it has no legal\n      entity is manifest from various sections [of the Code] which\n      place the entire matter under the control and supervision of\n      the board of supervisors.\n\f                                    53\n\nId. at 492, 113 N.W. at 332; see also Gish v. Castner-Williams & Askland\n\nDrainage Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 157, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 757 (1907) (noting that\n\na drainage district “is not such [a] legal entity as is known to or\n\nrecognized by law as a proper party to adversary proceedings”).\n\n      The “no legal entity” doctrine at first seemed to stick. In Board of\n\nSupervisors v. District Court, we characterized a drainage district as\n\nmerely “a segregated area of land, which has been set out by legal\n\nproceedings, and is subject to assessment for the construction of certain\n\ndrainage improvements.”     </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3436789\"><a href=\"/opinion/3438843/board-of-supervisors-v-district-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1033, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3436789\"><a href=\"/opinion/3438843/board-of-supervisors-v-district-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712\n\n(1930). Thus, a drainage district was simply a tract of land with metes\n\nand bounds that might be subject to improvement. It was acres of real\n\nestate, nothing more. You cannot sue the back forty.\n\n      Over time, however, the no-legal-entity theory began to fall apart.\n\nFor instance, in Wise v. Board of Supervisors, we considered a case in\n\nwhich the ditch of a drainage district was in poor repair such that it was\n\nnot operating properly. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 872, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1347391\"><a href=\"/opinion/1347391/wise-v-board-of-suprs-of-webster-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1951).\n\nThe plaintiffs, owners of farmland in the district, petitioned the board of\n\nsupervisors to repair the ditch. Id. at 871, 48 N.W.2d at 248. The board\n\nabandoned the repair project, however, when other landowners objected\n\nto the expense. Id. at 872, 48 N.W.2d at 248.\n\n      In Wise, we held, however, that it was clear the “repairs are\n\nnecessary to make the drainage improvement function properly.” Id. at\n\n874, 48 N.W.2d at 249. We granted mandamus to order the board to\n\nmake the necessary improvements. Id. at 875, 48 N.W.2d at 249. We\n\nleft the manner in which to proceed within the sound discretion of the\n\nboard. Id. Wise plainly stands for the proposition that there is at least\n\none equitable remedy available to require drainage districts to perform a\n\nduty, namely, mandamus.\n\f                                            54\n\n       We drifted still further away from the no-legal-entity doctrine in\n\nWapello County v. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2137525\"><a href=\"/opinion/2137525/wapello-county-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1965).                         In\n\nWapello County, we considered a dispute over county zoning.                       Id. at\n\n1232, 136 N.W.2d at 249.             In passing, we noted that various bodies,\n\nincluding drainage districts, have long been known to the law but defined\n\n“only in regard to certain specific purposes.” Id. at 1235, 136 N.W.2d at\n\n251.    We characterized these various bodies as “quasi municipal\n\ncorporations.” Id. The discussion, however, was dictum.\n\n       But the Wapello County dictum was followed by a concrete holding\n\nin State ex rel. Iowa Employment Security Commission v.

In that case, we\n\nconsidered whether a drainage district could be considered a “juristic\n\nentity” for purposes of retirement benefits under Iowa Code chapter 97C.\n\nId. at 345, 149 N.W.2d at 290.              We concluded that drainage districts\n\nwere a juristic entity because a drainage district was a “legally\n\nrecognizable     or   identifiable    political       body,   unit,   organization,   or\n\ninstrumentality of the state or any one or more of its political\n\nsubdivisions.”    Id. at 345–46, 149 N.W.2d at 290–91.                  We said, “[A]n\n\norganized drainage district is a political subdivision of the county in\n\nwhich it is located, its purpose being to aid in the governmental\n\nfunctions   of    the   county.        It    is   a    legally   identifiable   political\n\ninstrumentality.” Id. at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291.\n\n       As a result, the district court’s holding that it lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction was overruled. Id. at 347, 149 N.W.2d at 291. Iowa\n\nEmployment Security demonstrates how far our cases have travelled from\n\nthe no-legal-entity doctrine of the earlier cases. See Gish, 136 Iowa at\n\n157, 113 N.W. at 757; Clary, 135 Iowa at 492, 113 N.W. at 332.\n\nDrainage districts were now being recognized for what they obviously\n\f                                     55\n\nwere: a political subdivision of the county in which they were located.\n\nSee Iowa Emp’t Sec. Comm’n, 260 Iowa at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291.\n\n       We declined to invoke the notion that a drainage district was not\n\nan entity in Voogd v. Joint Drainage District No. 3–11, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2117959\"><a href=\"/opinion/2117959/voogd-v-joint-drain-dist-kossuth-winnebago-cos/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n393 (Iowa 1971).      In Voogd, plaintiff landowners sought to recover\n\npayments of past drainage assessments and to enjoin the counties’\n\ncollection of future assessments to pay for repairs.      Id. at 388.    The\n\nproblem in the case was that the counties originally approved the repair\n\nbased on low-ball estimates. Id. at 389. When costs skyrocketed, the\n\ncounties continued the repair project. Id. Plaintiffs cried foul.       Id. at\n\n390.\n\n       We agreed with the plaintiffs and held that future installments\n\ncould not be collected. Id. at 395. In addition, we ordered a refund of\n\nsome of the amount that the plaintiffs had already paid. Id. In Voogd,\n\nwe saw no problem in a drainage district being ordered to repay the\n\namount of funds previously collected.\n\n       Fourteen years later, in Fisher v. Dallas County, we considered a\n\ncase in which the plaintiff claimed to have experienced flooding problems\n\nbecause of the operation of a drainage district.     </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1240629\"><a href=\"/opinion/1240629/fisher-v-dallas-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427\n\n(Iowa 1985). The plaintiffs in Fisher did not contest our prior holdings.\n\nId. at 429–30. We repeated the familiar refrain that drainage districts\n\nonly had those powers expressly conferred by the legislature. Id. at 429.\n\nOn the question of money damages, we offered the qualified observation\n\nthat drainage districts had no corporate existence “for that purpose.” Id.\n\nIn Fisher, we characterized the unavailability of money damages as\n\n“immunity from suit in tort.” Id. at 430.\n\n       Yet, Fisher cited Wise and Voogd with apparent approval. Id. at\n\n429. Fisher did so, in part, by linking the relief afforded in each case to a\n\f                                        56\n\nstatutory provision. Id. We stated that the mandamus afforded in Wise\n\nwas based upon a duty to maintain a drainage district imposed by Iowa\n\nCode section 455.135(1). Id. We stated that action in Voogd challenging\n\nthe validity of assessments was based on the power to levy assessments\n\nin Iowa Code section 455.45. Id.\n\n      The fighting issue in Fisher was whether the enactment of the\n\nMunicipal Tort Claims Act, Iowa Code chapter 613A (now chapter 670),\n\noverruled our prior cases on the immunity of drainage districts from\n\nsuits in tort. Id. Under the Act, “municipalities” were subject to liability\n\nin tort with certain exceptions.      Id. at 430.    In Fisher, we held that a\n\ndrainage district was not a municipality.           Id.   We reasoned that a\n\ndrainage district’s immunity from suits in tort did not rise or fall with the\n\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity.             Id. at 430.   We retreated to old\n\nformulations, including the dubious suggestion that a drainage district\n\nwas “merely an area of land.”         Id.    We did not cite Iowa Employment\n\nSecurity, which declared drainage districts were “a political subdivision of\n\nthe county in which it is located” and “a legally identifiable political\n\ninstrumentality,” 260 Iowa at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291, nor did we cite\n\nVoogd, which declared that drainage districts were “political subdivisions\n\nof counties,” 188 N.W.2d at 393.\n\n      Justice Larson dissented. Fisher, 369 N.W.2d at 431 (Larson, J.,\n\ndissenting). He concluded that a drainage district was a “unit of local\n\ngovernment” under the Municipal Tort Claims Act and, as a result, was\n\namenable to tort law suits.     Id.     Although the dissent is cryptic, it is\n\napparent that Justice Larson was not buying the no-legal-entity\n\nargument. His dissent was more consistent with Wapello County, Iowa\n\nEmployment Security, and Voogd than the approach of the majority.\n\f                                    57\n\n      The next case of interest is Gard v. Little Sioux Intercounty Drainage\n\nDistrict, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1969287\"><a href=\"/opinion/1969287/gard-v-little-sioux-intercounty-drainage/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 1994). In Gard, we rejected a claim for\n\nmoney damages by the estate of drowned boaters. Id. at 697, 699. We\n\ncited Fisher for the proposition that drainage districts have limited\n\npowers. Id. at 698. We emphasized the narrow proposition that “Iowa\n\nhas never allowed tort claims for money damages to be made against a\n\ndrainage district.” Id. (emphasis added). The focus in Gard was not on a\n\nno-legal-entity theory, but on the limited statutory power of drainage\n\ndistricts.\n\n      Finally, we considered a claim against a drainage district in\n\nChicago Central & Pacific Railroad v. Calhoun County Board of\n\nSupervisors, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 2012). A railroad sought to recover\n\nmonies voluntarily spent on repairs of a drainage district improvement.\n\nId. at 368.   The railroad in this case faced a conundrum.          See id.\n\nBecause of problems with a drainage ditch, it could not operate its\n\nrailroad. Id. Yet, it would take some time to get the drainage district to\n\nmove on the problem. Id. The railroad decided that instead of waiting\n\nfor the drainage district to resolve the problem, which could take\n\nconsiderable time, the railroad voluntarily performed the repair to get its\n\noperations up and running as soon as possible. Id. at 369. It then sued\n\nthe drainage district, seeking to recover the cost of the repair. Id. We\n\ndeclared that while the railroad could have filed a mandamus action to\n\nforce the railroad to make the repair, it could not, under our caselaw,\n\nseek money damages. Id. at 378. Chicago Central did not mention the\n\nno-legal-entity theory.\n\n      C. The Overflow Cases: Avoiding Statutory Suicide. Now I turn\n\nto what might be called “the overflow cases.” The classic overflow case\n\narises when downstream landowners complain when upland drainage\n\f                                    58\n\ndistricts, by removing water and directing it into rivers and streams,\n\ncause flooding downstream.\n\n      The seminal overflow case is Maben v. Olsen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1919).     In Maben, we considered whether a downstream\n\nlandowner could obtain an injunction against a drainage district where\n\nthe activities of the drainage district caused overflow downstream. Id. at\n\n1063, 175 N.W. at 513.       In Maben, we characterized the controlling\n\nquestion as,\n\n      Is it unauthorized and unlawful to establish a drainage\n      district if so doing will cause water to come into the natural\n      outlet for the district more rapidly and in greater quantity\n      than if the land in the district were left to send its surface\n      water into said outlet without interference by a drainage\n      system, and if it further appears that the increase in rapidity\n      and volume may overtax the natural outlet and cause a\n      damaging overflow to lands below the entrance to such\n      outlet.\n\nId.\n\n      In Maben, we held that the Iowa Constitution expressly authorized\n\nthe legislature to give the board of supervisors the power to do precisely\n\nwhat we had described.      Id. at 1063–64, 175 N.W. at 513–14.         The\n\nspecific question was further characterized as whether the delegation of\n\npower to establish drainage systems “may be interfered with by a court of\n\nequity because, through its exercise, a more rapid and a greater flow will\n\nreach a natural outlet, to the possible or even probable injury of the\n\nlower owners.” Id. at 1065, 175 N.W. at 514. But, as we pointed out, the\n\n“cardinal purpose” of draining agricultural lands is acceleration and\n\nincreased overflow. Id.\n\n      In short, the result urged by the Maben plaintiff would ensure that\n\nthe power given to the drainage districts could not “be used to\n\naccomplish the only purpose for which it [was] given.”       Id.   In other\n\f                                    59\n\nwords, the legislature could not have intended overflow to be a nuisance\n\nbecause if it did drainage districts simply could not function.              Id.\n\nApplication of generally applicable nuisance law was thus flatly\n\ninconsistent with the specific purpose of drainage districts.\n\n      It is hard to argue against the reasoning in Maben. Indeed, prior\n\nto the enactment of article I, section 18, the biggest obstacle to draining\n\nfarmland was securing the right to drain water onto the land of another.\n\nSee Joseph W. Otto, Subject to Overflow: The History of Drainage Districts\n\nin Jasper County, Iowa 25 (Aug. 2012) (unpublished M.A. dissertation,\n\nAppalachian     State    University),    https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/\n\nOtto,%20Joseph_2012_Thesis.pdf.          Article   I,   section   18   and   the\n\nimplementing statutes were designed to eliminate the problem—that is\n\nwhy Maben is clearly correct.\n\n      But it is important to note the narrowness of the reasoning and its\n\nholding.   Clearly, Maben had nothing to do with a claim arising from\n\nalleged pollution. And, in fact, the Maben court went to great lengths to\n\ndistinguish cases involving pollution of waterways by government\n\nentities, thereby demonstrating the narrowness of its holding. 187 Iowa\n\nat 1068–70, 175 N.W. at 515–16; see, e.g., City of Atlanta v.

In Vogt v. City of Grinnell, we considered an\n\naction brought against a city for discharging sewage into the stream to\n\nthe material injury of lower riparian owners.      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (1907).     We noted that a statute authorized the city to\n\nconstruct a system of sewers but did not authorize emptying the sewers\n\ninto a running stream even if the system was functioning as designed.\n\nId. at 365, 110 N.W. at 603. The sewer system was operating perfectly in\n\nVogt, but the unauthorized discharge of sewage to the material injury of\n\nriparian proprietors was a wrongful act.      Id.; see also Boyd v. City of\n\nOskaloosa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492 (1917).\n\n      We considered a later overflow case in Miller v. Monona County,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3430324\"><a href=\"/opinion/3432785/miller-v-monona-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3430324\"><a href=\"/opinion/3432785/miller-v-monona-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1940).         In Monona County, the plaintiff\n\nsought a mandatory injunction to abate nuisances caused by water\n\noverflow as a result of dust storms and vegetation filling the ditches of\n\nthe drainage district. Id. at 168, 294 N.W. at 310. In Monona County we\n\nstated, “The drainage district is a special creation of the legislature and it\n\f                                     61\n\nrequires no argument to sustain the proposition that it cannot create a\n\nnuisance while operating within the ambit of power constitutionally\n\ndelegated.” Id. at 169, 294 N.W. at 311.\n\n      Whenever a court says that no argument is necessary to sustain a\n\nproposition, we should be especially alert for potential error.       Like\n\nMaben, Monona County, however, was not a pollution case.           It was\n\nanother overflow case.     The Monona County court had no interest in\n\nthrusting overflow liability onto drainage districts, even if the overflow\n\nwas a result of a failure to repair drainage districts. See id.\n\n      D. Compliance with Internal Duties Arising from Iowa Code\n\nChapter 468. There are a number of cases where plaintiffs have sought\n\nto require drainage districts to comply with statutory duties arising from\n\nIowa Code chapter 468. For instance, as described earlier, we heard a\n\ncase where plaintiffs sought to require the board of supervisors to repair\n\na drainage ditch, which was obstructed and in poor repair. Wise, 242\n\nIowa at 871–72, 48 N.W.2d at 248.          Originally, the board began the\n\nproject, but abandoned it when other landowners in the district objected\n\nto the expense. Id. at 872, 48 N.W.2d at 248.\n\n      In Wise, we held that it was clear under the record that “repairs\n\nare necessary to make the drainage improvement function properly.” Id.\n\nat 874, 48 N.W.2d at 249. We granted mandamus to order the board to\n\nmake the improvements. Id. at 875, 48 N.W.2d at 249. Mandamus is an\n\nappropriate remedy to compel drainage districts to perform a legal duty\n\nunder Wise. Additionally, in Voogd, we granted an injunction against a\n\ndrainage district to prevent the collection of future assessments to pay\n\nfor a drainage district improvement. 188 N.W.2d at 395.\n\n      The availability of mandamus to require a drainage district to\n\nperform needed repairs was also discussed in Chicago Central, which was\n\f                                    62\n\ndescribed above. 816 N.W.2d at 373–74. We held that money damages\n\nwere not available, but we declared that the railroad could have filed a\n\nmandamus action to compel the district to make the repair. Id. at 378.\n\n      E. Compliance with External Statutory Duties Arising Outside\n\nChapter 468: Defeat of the Impenetrable Legal Bubble Theory. We\n\nhave, on occasion, considered the interplay between Iowa Code chapter\n\n468 and other statutes. The cases demonstrate that drainage districts\n\nare not hermetically sealed in an impenetrable legal bubble from other\n\nrequirements of the Code.\n\n      In Iowa Employment Security, the Iowa Employment Security\n\nCommission assessed and levied taxes and interest claimed due from a\n\ndrainage district under Iowa Code chapters 97B and 97C. 260 Iowa at\n\n342, 149 N.W.2d at 289. There was no statutory provision in Iowa Code\n\nchapter 468 authorizing the drainage district to pay these taxes. Id. at\n\n343–44, 149 N.W.2d at 289–90.            The Iowa Employment Security\n\nCommission, however, sought to compel the drainage district to “perform\n\nasserted statutory duties.” Id. at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291. We agreed\n\nwith the commission and held that the provisions of Iowa Code chapter\n\n97B and 97C could be enforced and that mandamus against the\n\ndrainage district was “the proper remedy.” Id. Thus, equitable remedies\n\nare available to enforce against drainage districts duties that arise from\n\nstatutory provisions outside Iowa Code chapter 468.\n\n      There is one other case of interest. In Polk County Drainage District\n\nFour v. Iowa Natural Resources Council, we considered whether a\n\ndrainage   district   had   complete     authority   over   construction   of\n\nimprovements under chapter 468 or whether the Iowa Natural Resources\n\nCouncil (INRC) had the power to approve or deny permits for such\n\nconstruction under Iowa Code chapter 455A. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1274791\"><a href=\"/opinion/1274791/polk-county-v-ia-natural-resources-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239–40\n\f                                         63\n\n(Iowa 1985). We held that the INRC had concurrent authority over such\n\nconstruction. Id. at 241. We emphasized that when two statutes deal\n\nwith the same subject, courts endeavor to give effect to both enactments.\n\nId.    While drainage district statutes were to be liberally construed,\n\naccording to the Polk County court, environmental policy statutes were\n\nalso   to   be   liberally   construed   because    of   the   important   policy\n\nconsiderations underlying them.           Id.   Polk County stands for the\n\nproposition that claims of exclusive authority by drainage districts must\n\ngive way to an environmental policy statute governing the same subject\n\nmatter.\n\n       F. No Money Damages for Torts. As can be seen above, we have,\n\nin a number of cases, refused to allow an award of money damages\n\nagainst a drainage district. But our statements in that regard have been\n\nsometimes limited. For example, in Fisher, we considered a case where\n\nplaintiffs experienced flooding problems because of the operation of a\n\ndrainage district.     369 N.W.2d at 427.          On the question of money\n\ndamages, we offered the limited observation that drainage districts have\n\nno corporate existence “for that purpose.” Id. at 429. We also offered the\n\nbroad characterization that the unavailability of money damages against\n\na drainage district amounted to “immunity from suit in tort.” Id. at 430.\n\n       The next case of interest is Gard, 521 N.W.2d at 696. In Gard, we\n\nrejected a claim for money damages by the estate of drowned boaters. Id.\n\nat 699. We cited Fischer for the proposition that drainage districts have\n\nlimited powers. Id. at 698. We emphasized the narrow proposition that\n\n“Iowa has never allowed tort claims for money damages to be made\n\nagainst a drainage district.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n       We made a similar declaration in Chicago Central. Although it was\n\nin the context of reimbursement for a repair, we restated that although\n\f                                   64\n\nmandamus was available to cause a drainage district to do its duty,\n\nmoney damages were not an available remedy.          Chicago Cent., 816\n\nN.W.2d at 378.\n\n      G. Silence! Post Home Rule Cases.        Finally, there is one more\n\nobservation that must be made regarding our drainage district caselaw.\n\nNo-money-damages cases like Fisher and Gard emphasize the limited\n\nnature of drainage district authority.   See Gard, 521 N.W.2d at 698;\n\nFisher, 369 N.W.2d at 429. Yet, in 1978, Iowa passed an amendment to\n\nthe Iowa Constitution establishing county home rule. Iowa Const. art.\n\nIII, § 39A. Under county home rule, the so-called Dillon rule is abolished\n\nand local governments have broadened powers.           Polk Cty. Bd. of\n\nSupervisors v. Polk Commonwealth Charter Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1834498\"><a href=\"/opinion/1834498/polk-cty-bd-of-suprs-v-charter-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n790–91 (Iowa 1994).      While several of our drainage district cases\n\noccurred after the enactment of the county home rule amendment, none\n\nof them consider the impact of home rule on our cases. In this case,\n\nDMWW claims that Fisher and Gard are no longer viable authority\n\nbecause the power of drainage districts is no longer limited as it was\n\nprior to county home rule.\n\n      IV. Potential Remedies Against Drainage Districts.\n\n      A. Introduction. It seems to me that much of the rhetoric of our\n\ndrainage district cases is not entirely accurate. The notion that drainage\n\ndistricts are not entities strikes me as simply wrong. Further, although\n\nwe declare that drainage districts have “immunity” from money damages,\n\nI am not sure that is an accurate description of what our caselaw in fact\n\nsupports.   I do not see in our cases a legislative or judicial policy\n\njudgment that drainage districts should be generally immune from\n\npotential damages in tort.\n\f                                    65\n\n      Instead, I conclude that the real issue at stake here is not whether\n\nwe should abandon the wrong-headed notion that drainage districts are\n\nnot entities or whether we should abrogate some kind of immunity based\n\nupon some perception of public policy. The real question relates to the\n\nability, or lack of ability, of a drainage district to comply with a court-\n\nordered damage or injunctive remedy related to pollution. I am inclined\n\nto agree with the drainage district that an injunction against a state\n\nofficial “is utterly meaningless” when the official against whom the\n\ninjunction is granted lacks the power to redress the associated injuries.\n\nOkpalobi v. Foster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"23577\"><a href=\"/opinion/23577/okpalobi-v-foster/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 426–27 (5th Cir. 2001). In short, the\n\nremedies questions posed in this case are about whether the defendants\n\nhave the authority to comply with a potential judgment for money\n\ndamages or an injunction fashioned to abate a nuisance should the\n\nDMWW prevail on its substantive nuisance claims. These are questions\n\nof law, not fact.\n\n      B. Money Damages and Application of Stare Decisis.\n\n      1. Introduction.   On the issue of money damages, the drainage\n\ndistrict defendants argue that we are bound by stare decisis to follow our\n\nprecedents.    As shown above, in several contexts, our cases proclaim\n\nthat money damages in tort are not available against drainage districts,\n\nmost persuasively because of their limited statutory powers.\n\n      DMWW draws our attention to three potential problems.          First,\n\nDMWW attacks the general reasoning employed in our no-money-\n\ndamages cases and invites us to abandon them as a relic of the past.\n\nSecond, DMWW points out that our no-money-damages cases do not\n\ninvolve cases concerning pollution or, more narrowly, pollution allegedly\n\narising in violation of statutory nuisance. Third, DMWW challenges the\n\nreasoning of our cases refusing to allow money damages.            Finally,\n\f                                     66\n\nDMWW contends that even if our cases might be otherwise entitled to\n\nstare decisis, the enactment of county home rule in 1978 deprives these\n\ncases of their precedential value.\n\n      2. Rationale of no-money-damages cases. To some extent, I agree\n\nwith DMWW that some of the reasoning employed in our no-money-\n\ndamages caselaw is flawed. As indicated above, I do not accept the no-\n\nlegal-entity line of reasoning or the characterization of nonliability as\n\nbased on immunity. What I do think is at play in our cases, however, is\n\nthe notion that drainage districts have limited statutory powers and that\n\nthese powers do not include the ability to pay money damages.\n\nCertainly, as the drainage district defendants point out, DMWW has been\n\nunable to point to any statutory provision in the more than six hundred\n\nsections of Iowa Code chapter 468 that expressly authorizes payment of\n\nmoney damages.\n\n      We have long held, even in the pre-home rule days, that local\n\ngovernment authority includes not only what is expressed but also what\n\nis necessarily implied.   See, e.g., Woodbury County v. Anderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1720788\"><a href=\"/opinion/1720788/woodbury-county-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134 (Iowa 1969); In re Estate of Frentress, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n786, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1586433\"><a href=\"/opinion/1586433/in-re-frentressestate/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368 (1958). There is, perhaps, an argument that\n\nthe power to pay for money damages should be necessarily implied from\n\nchapter 468, but I do not find such an implication compelling. At the\n\ntime chapter 468 was enacted, sovereign immunity was the rule and not\n\nthe exception. I doubt that the legislature intended when it granted the\n\ndrainage districts limited express powers to imply a power that under\n\nprevailing law was not generally available absent legislative consent. I\n\nthus conclude that the argument that drainage districts have an implied\n\npower to pay money damages does not have much merit.\n\f                                       67\n\n        3. Broad case holdings and stare decisis.       The next question I\n\nconsider is whether the cases that might be entitled to stare decisis cover\n\nthe present controversy. DMWW is correct that cases like Fisher, Gard,\n\nand Chicago Central do not involve pollution matters. And, in particular,\n\nthey do not arise in the context of claimed violation of duties arising out\n\nof other statutes such as statutory nuisance. Iowa Code § 657.2(4). Yet,\n\nthe language of the cases is quite broad—“Iowa has never allowed tort\n\nclaims for money damages to be made against a drainage district”! Gard,\n\n521 N.W.2d at 698.\n\n        The question is whether prior broad statements of law are entitled\n\nto stare decisis even when the facts of a subsequent case are arguably\n\ndistinguishable. See, e.g., Indep. Inst. v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2016) (“The nature of our system of legal precedent is that later\n\ncases    often   distinguish   prior   cases   based   on   sometimes   slight\n\ndifferences.”); Richard M. Re, Narrowing Supreme Court Precedent from\n\nBelow, 104 Geo. L.J. 921, 924–25 (2016) (describing how lower federal\n\ncourts will often “narrow from below” outdated or ambiguous Supreme\n\nCourt precedents); Richard M. Re, Narrowing Precedent in the Supreme\n\nCourt, 114 Colum. L. Rev. 1861, 1875–89 (2014) (arguing that healthy\n\nstare decisis can require methods of narrowing broadly stated precedent\n\nin order to avoid overruling a case when its “best reading,” i.e. the\n\nprecedent as actually stated, would require an outcome inconsistent with\n\nother legal principles). Of course, the next case is always different, in\n\nsome way, from prior cases. But at the same time, context matters. The\n\nquestion is whether a broad legal expression is binding in the contexts\n\nother than that in which it has arisen? Here, unlike in Fisher, Gard, and\n\nChicago Central, a statute outside of Iowa Code chapter 468 imposes a\n\f                                    68\n\nduty not to create or continue a nuisance—no similar statutory duties\n\nwere present in the cases disallowing money damages.\n\n      I do not have a very clear answer for this interesting question.\n\nThere is considerable appeal to the argument that broad statements of\n\nlaw are binding only in the factual setting from which they arise and are\n\nreally only dicta with respect to other claims. The law constantly evolves\n\nby distinguishing past precedent based on factual differences.       As is\n\napparent from this opinion, I regard many of the issues posed in this\n\ncase as abundantly nuanced and contextual. Certainly we can all agree\n\nthat we have never considered the potential liability of drainage districts\n\nin the context of a claim that the operation causes violation of federal\n\npollution law.\n\n      We should be particularly alert to avoid masking preferred policy\n\nchoices in a stare decisis costume. And, an overburdened court may be\n\ntempted to over read precedent in the name of efficiency and quick\n\nresults, but such an approach runs the risk of uncritical dispositions.\n\n      Yet, notions of nuance and context could be extended so far that\n\nthere would almost never be an occasion to apply stare decisis and\n\nliterally nothing would ever be settled in the law.    In close cases, the\n\ndetermination of whether to apply stare decisis is a matter of judgment,\n\nnot inexorable command.\n\n      It seems to me that one relevant line of inquiry is whether a\n\nreasonable drainage district would rely on the statements in our caselaw\n\nas binding in the structuring of its financial and business affairs. In our\n\ncases, particularly Gard and Chicago Central, the statements about\n\nmoney damages are emphatic and were made in contexts where the\n\nplaintiffs’ claims had considerable equitable appeal.       Yet, in Iowa\n\nEmployment Security, the drainage district was required to pay money—\n\f                                          69\n\nnot damages in tort, perhaps, but money nonetheless—to a government\n\nagency based on statutory requirements outside of Iowa Code chapter\n\n468. See 260 Iowa at 346–47, 149 N.W.2d at 291. And, in Polk County,\n\nwe recognized that environmental regulations would be enforced in the\n\nface of a claim that drainage districts had exclusive jurisdiction for\n\nmatters within the scope of its authority. See 377 N.W.2d at 241. Yet,\n\nthe issue here is not regulatory enforcement, as in Polk County, or\n\npayment of money to government entity, as required in Iowa Employment\n\nSecurity, but a question of money damages for an alleged civil wrong.\n\n       Although a close question, I am inclined to go along with the\n\napplication of stare decisis on the question of the availability of money\n\ndamages in this case.          The most valid rationale for the no-money-\n\ndamages approach—that a drainage district has limited powers—is a\n\nbroad proposition that applies across the board. 16 Further, it seems to\n\nme that a reasonable drainage district might forgo the possibility of\n\ninsurance in light of our caselaw. See, e.g., State v. Peeler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n857 (Conn. 2016) (Zarella, J., dissenting) (noting, among other costs to\n\nindividuals of overturning precedent, the impact on risk-shifting\n\narrangements like insurance policies); Crist v.

See 260 Iowa at 346–\n47, 149 N.W.2d at 291. The power to pay for statutorily required retirement benefits\ncould only have been an implied power. I have, however, rejected the notion of an\nimplied power to pay money damages for torts.\n\f                                     70\n\ndecision because, in part, the precedent did not cause large numbers of\n\npeople to attempt to conform their conduct to the decision by, for\n\nexample, deciding whether to purchase insurance or not).         Further,\n\nwhere the result of precedent is defensible and the legislature has had a\n\nrelatively recent reminder in Chicago Central four years ago, we should\n\nbe cautious to reexamine precedent. See Doe v. New London Cmty. Sch.\n\nDist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355 (Iowa 2014); Ackelson v.

So, although I am not\n\ncompletely confident in the result, I am inclined to conclude that stare\n\ndecisis precludes our reconsideration of our caselaw that generally\n\nstands for the proposition that money damages are not an available\n\nremedy against drainage districts.\n\n      4. Impact of county home rule amendment. DMWW argues that our\n\nprior precedent is based on perceived limitations in the statutory\n\nauthority of drainage districts. DMWW asserts that this rationale is no\n\nlonger applicable in light of the enactment of the county home rule\n\namendment to the Iowa Constitution.       Under the county home rule\n\namendment, counties are no longer subject to the Dillon rule, which\n\nstated that local governments only have those powers expressly granted\n\nor necessarily applied or necessarily implied.   See Iowa Const. art. III,\n\n§ 39A; cf. City of Des Moines v. Master Builders of Iowa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1954581\"><a href=\"/opinion/1954581/city-of-des-moines-v-master-builders/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n703 (Iowa 1993) (en banc) (considering the home rule amendment as\n\napplied to city government). DMWW argues that drainage districts, as\n\nsubdivisions of the county, now have larger powers, including the power\n\nto pay money damages for environmental pollution.       DMWW correctly\n\nasserts that our post-county home rule cases, Fisher, Gard, and Chicago\n\nCentral, do not address the question of whether home rule impacts the\n\nno-money-damages rule.\n\f                                     71\n\n      The majority indicates that even if they have the benefit of home\n\nrule, the drainage districts do not have the power to tax beyond that\n\nauthorized by the general assembly.       That is, of course, an accurate\n\nproposition.   Yet, the Iowa Constitution expressly vests authority in\n\ndrainage districts to impose special assessments.       Iowa Const. art. I,\n\n§ 18. Further, we have held that special assessments do not necessarily\n\namount to a tax. Bennett v. Greenwalt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3434145\"><a href=\"/opinion/3436368/bennett-v-greenwalt/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1134, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3434145\"><a href=\"/opinion/3436368/bennett-v-greenwalt/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732 (1939).    Thus, the relevant question is whether a drainage\n\ndistrict may use its expressly authorized special assessment power to\n\npay money damages arising from pollution. I am not sure of the answer\n\nto this question if home rule applies to drainage districts.\n\n      But, I doubt that county home rule applies to drainage districts.\n\nThe county home rule amendment applies only to “counties” or “joint\n\ncounty-municipal corporations.”       A county, however, has not been\n\nnamed as a defendant in this litigation.           Although constitutional\n\nlanguage is often open textured and our interpretation must show fidelity\n\nto the underlying constitutional values animating the language, a\n\ndrainage district is not the same as a county, but instead is a\n\ngovernmental subdivision of the county in which they are located. Iowa\n\nEmployment Security, 260 Iowa at 346, 149 N.W.2d at 291. The question\n\nis thus whether the unquestionably broad home rule of a county is\n\nvicariously passed on to a subdivision of the county.\n\n      It is my conclusion that drainage districts do not come within the\n\nscope of the county home rule amendment.            The county home rule\n\namendment was directed to county and county-municipal corporations\n\nthat exercise general police powers and not to tightly regulated, limited\n\npurpose entities like a drainage district whose governing structure, to\n\nsome extent, merely overlaps with county government.

Assuming as a matter of law that money damages are not\n\navailable, DMWW raises due process, equal protection, and inalienable\n\nrights arguments under the Iowa Constitution challenging this state of\n\naffairs. DMWW asserts that the judicially created doctrine of immunity\n\nfrom money damages simply has to be abandoned. DMWW claims that\n\nIowa constitutional infirmities arise from such an irrational and arbitrary\n\nstate of affairs when most governmental entities are liable for such\n\nmoney damages but drainage districts are not.\n\n      DMWW argues by analogy based on our decisions in cases\n\nincluding Miller v. Boone County Hospital, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1640867\"><a href=\"/opinion/1640867/miller-v-boone-county-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 1986),\n\nGacke, 684 N.W.2d at 168, and Hensler v.

In Miller, we struck down a statute imposing more\n\nstringent   procedural   requirements    on   tort   claims   against   local\n\ngovernments on equal protection grounds.         394 N.W.2d at 781.       In\n\nGacke, we held that an immunity provision in Iowa Code section\n\f                                    73\n\n657.11(2) exempting certain livestock operators from nuisance claims\n\namounted to a per se taking under the Iowa Constitution. 684 N.W.2d at\n\n174–75.   In Hensler, we developed a two-step process for determining\n\nwhether a particular state action violates substantive due process,\n\nincluding a determination of whether a right is fundamental which,\n\nDMWW asserts, certainly includes its right to compensation for\n\nenvironmental harms. See 790 N.W.2d at 580–81. DMWW maintains\n\nthat if, in fact, drainage districts are immune from nuisance damages,\n\nsuch immunity is constitutionally infirm under the equal protection, due\n\nprocess, and inalienable rights clauses of the Iowa Constitution as\n\napplied in Miller, Gacke, and Hensler.\n\n      If the plaintiff in this case was a citizen as in Miller, Gacke, and\n\nHensler, DMWW’s argument would need to be confronted. But this case\n\ninvolves a government subdivision suing another government subdivision\n\nfor alleged damages from environmental harm.         While our cases on\n\ndrainage districts use the term “immunity,” which inevitably gives rise to\n\nthe comparison with Gacke, the comparison is flawed. While the cases\n\nare sometimes couched in immunity language, the use of the term\n\n“immunity” is inaccurate. The real issue, to me, is a limitation of the\n\npower of drainage districts compared to other entities.\n\n      Where the crux of the constitutional issue is the constitutional\n\nvalidity of a limitation on the power of a government subdivision, our\n\ncaselaw suggests that another government subdivision does not have the\n\npower to bring these claims. See Bd. of Supervisors v. Dep’t of Revenue,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1927746\"><a href=\"/opinion/1927746/bd-of-suprs-of-linn-cty-v-dept-of-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232 (Iowa 1978). If a government subdivision cannot\n\ncomplain of any act of the legislature diminishing its revenue, amending\n\nits charter, or even dissolving it, it may be argued that DMWW as a\n\nlegislative creature cannot attack the limitations of power of another\n\f                                       74\n\nlegislative creature, the drainage district, absent a clear constitutional\n\ncommand to the contrary. See McSurely v.

I do not,\n\nhowever, opine more generally on standing issues involving government\n\nsubdivisions as plaintiffs.     In particular, as will be explained below, I\n\nconclude that DMWW may raise a takings claim under article I, section\n\n18 of the Iowa Constitution against the drainage district defendants.\n\n      D. Equitable Relief to Abate Nuisance.\n\n      1. Introduction.    The question of whether equitable remedies are\n\navailable to abate an alleged nuisance caused by drainage districts raises\n\na fundamentally different question than the money damages controversy.\n\nIn order to address this different question, I first consider whether\n\ninjunctive relief is available against drainage districts generally. I then\n\nturn to the question of whether nuisance provides a substantive legal\n\nbasis for an injunction in a pollution context generally. Next, I consider\n\nwhether an injunction to abate a nuisance arising from alleged pollution\n\nmay be entered against drainage districts. Finally, I consider the merits\n\nof DMWW’s contention that it is entitled to seek injunctive relief if it can\n\nprove its nuisance case under the facts presented to us by the certifying\n\nfederal court in this case.\n\n      2. Availability    of   injunctive    relief   against   drainage    districts\n\ngenerally.   The question here is whether injunctive relief is part of a\n\njudicial tool kit that might be available to the district court in the event\n\nthat DMWW demonstrates an entitlement to relief. The mere fact that\n\f                                      75\n\nmoney damages are not available, even if based on immunity, does not\n\nprevent the availability of equitable relief.    While our cases repeatedly\n\nassert that money damages are not available, our cases clearly state that\n\nequitable relief is available against drainage districts. For example, we\n\nhave said the equitable remedy of mandamus is available to order\n\nmembers of the board of supervisors to ensure that the drainage district\n\nmeets a mandatory legal duty. Wise, 242 Iowa at 874, 48 N.W.2d at 249.\n\nWe have said that injunctive relief is available to order a drainage district\n\nto repay money assessed pursuant to a void repair contract. Voogd, 188\n\nN.W.2d at 393.\n\n      I am not sure the fine distinction between mandamus and\n\ninjunction matters much.      We have said that mandamus would lie to\n\ncompel a city to abate a continuing public nuisance where it was under a\n\nduty to abate the nuisance. Cowin v. City of Waterloo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3437254\"><a href=\"/opinion/3439269/cowin-v-city-of-waterloo/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n212–13, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3437254\"><a href=\"/opinion/3439269/cowin-v-city-of-waterloo/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 710 (1946).         In Wise, mandamus was issued\n\nwhen there was a clear duty, yet no detailed instructions regarding how\n\nthe district could meet that duty. 242 Iowa at 874, 48 N.W.2d at 249.\n\nWhether or not DMWW can make the case for a Wise-type remedy is of\n\ncourse not clear at this early point in the litigation.\n\n      And, it seems to me that injunctive relief in a proper case should\n\nbe available, too.    The value of injunctive relief is that it allows the\n\ndistrict court to shape the remedy to meet the contours of the problem.\n\nSee Brown v.

Nuisance as basis for equitable relief to abate pollution generally.\n\nI now examine the underlying substantive basis of DMWW’s claim for the\n\nremedy of an injunction. DMWW claims that Iowa nuisance law provides\n\na basis for equitable relief.\n\n      We recently canvassed the application of nuisance law to\n\nenvironmental matters in Freeman, 848 N.W.2d at 66–69. As we noted\n\nin Freeman, common law nuisance theory has provided a remedy for\n\nenvironmental wrongs reaching back into the seventeenth century. Id. at\n\n66.   We noted in Freeman the availability of nuisance to address\n\nenvironmental harms was endorsed by the Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts, which included sections on both public and private nuisance. Id.;\n\nsee Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 821B–821E, at 87–104 (1979). We\n\nquoted a leading commentator who noted that nuisance “continues to be\n\nthe fulcrum of what is called today environmental law.” Freeman, 848\n\nN.W.2d at 66–67 (quoting 1 William H. Rodgers, Jr., Environmental Law:\n\nAir and Water § 2.1, at 29 (1986)). We noted in Freeman that nuisance\n\ntheory had been recognized in Iowa for decades in the environmental\n\ncontexts. Id. at 67; see also Kriener, 212 N.W.2d at 536 (finding noxious\n\nodor from sewage facility amounted to a private nuisance); Ryan v. City of\n\nEmmetsburg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3431980\"><a href=\"/opinion/3434329/ryan-v-city-of-emmetsburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3431980\"><a href=\"/opinion/3434329/ryan-v-city-of-emmetsburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438 (1942) (concerning a\n\nprivate nuisance arising from sewer system).\n\n      We further recognized in Freeman that the Iowa legislature\n\nexplicitly endorsed nuisance theory by enacting a statutory nuisance\n\naction in Iowa Code section 657.1.        848 N.W.2d at 67.        We have\n\nconsistently held that the statutory nuisance provisions do not preempt\n\ncommon law nuisance claims but supplement them. Id.\n\f                                     78\n\n      In Freeman, we recognized the modern trend to control the\n\nenvironment through the enactment of regulatory statutory regimes. Id.\n\nat 68–69.   We pointed out in Freeman, however, that the purpose of\n\nregulatory statutory environmental regimes was to protect the public\n\ngenerally and not to provide a remedy for special harms to property at a\n\nspecific location.   Id. at 69.    As a result, we held that applicable\n\nprovisions of the Clean Air Act did not preempt state common law\n\nnuisance claims. Id. at 84–85.\n\n      Freeman involved a case of air pollution, not water pollution. But,\n\nunder a Freeman-type analysis, nuisance theory provides a potential\n\nbasis for an injunction in cases involving water pollution that has not\n\nbeen preempted by state or federal statutes dealing with water pollution.\n\n      4. Appropriateness of nuisance remedy against drainage districts.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, the process of adjudication of nuisance\n\nclaims—with the rules of evidence, the orderly development of a record,\n\nthorough consideration by a fair and impartial trial judge, and the\n\npossibility of appeal to a dispassionate appellate court—has many\n\nattractive qualities. Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving causation, and\n\nthe degree of harm is based in fact, not supposition.         Remedies are\n\nspecifically sculpted to meet the factual showing of the plaintiffs.\n\n      The case-by-case nuisance approach is consistent with what is\n\nknown in environmental law as the PPP, or the “polluter pays principle.”\n\nThe PPP principle is recognized as a norm in international environmental\n\nlaw and, according to one commentator, should apply when agricultural\n\nactivities impose environmental harm that affects private and public\n\nproperty.   See Margaret Rosso Grossman, Agriculture and the Polluter\n\nPays Principle: An Introduction, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Okla.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 1, 3 (2006); Boris N.\n\nMamlyuk, Analyzing the Polluter Pays Principle Through Law and\n\f                                          79\n\nEconomics, 18 Se. Envtl. L.J. 39, 42 (2009); Ved P. Nanda, Agriculture\n\nand the Polluter Pays Principle, 54 Am. J. Comp. L. 317, 319–20 (2006).\n\n      The majority suggests that solutions to water quality are better\n\nadvanced by the “elected branches of government who are responsible to\n\nthe people.”       The majority ignores the fact that the legislature has\n\nenacted a nuisance statute that DMWW seeks to enforce. See Iowa Code\n\nch. 657.     The Iowa legislature, unlike the majority, has thus generally\n\nendorsed nuisance as a means of environmental protection.                      It has\n\nprovided a specific statutory mechanism for abatement of nuisances and\n\npayment of expenses associated with abatement. See Iowa Code § 657.7.\n\nThe legislature added an exclamation point by making the creation or\n\ncontinuing of a nuisance a criminal offense. See id. § 657.3.\n\n      And, tellingly, the legislature crafted a narrow exception to Iowa\n\nCode chapter 657 for certain animal feeding operations. 17                            Id.\n\n§ 657.11(2). That is the only exception in chapter 657. The legislature\n\nthus contemplated who might be exempt from nuisance requirements\n\ngenerally.     It did not exempt drainage districts.

Relevant drainage district caselaw regarding nuisance claims.\n\nDMWW seeks relief in this case under both common law and statutory\n\nnuisance theories. As indicated above, there is nothing in our caselaw\n\nsuggesting that equitable remedies are not available to abate pollution\n\n      17This   provision was declared unconstitutional in Gacke, 684 N.W.2d at 179.\n\f                                      80\n\nallegedly caused by drainage districts. In Vogt, we allowed a damages\n\nremedy in a case brought against a city for discharging sewage into the\n\nstream to the material injury of lower riparian owners. 133 Iowa at 363,\n\n110 N.W. at 603–04. Nothing in the case indicated equitable relief was\n\nnot available for this type of harm.        While we denied an injunction\n\nagainst a drainage district in Maben, we took great pains to distinguish\n\noverflow from environmental nuisances. 187 Iowa at 1068, 175 N.W. at\n\n515–16. Finally, we granted an injunction against a drainage district in\n\nVoogd to prohibit the collection of additional installment payments. 188\n\nN.W.2d at 395.\n\n      Further, we have held in several cases that equitable remedies are\n\navailable against the management of a drainage district to force\n\ncompliance with the law.         To me, in addition to cases like Iowa\n\nEmployment Security, these cases are the death knell of the no-legal-\n\nentity approach in other cases, an obvious proposition not recognized by\n\nthe majority. And, if mandamus is available in an appropriate case, as\n\nour cases clearly establish, why would injunctive relief not be available in\n\nan appropriate case, as it was in Voogd?\n\n      Thus, unlike on the question of money damages, our cases do not\n\nuniformly and clearly hold that injunctive relief is not available in the\n\ncontext of a pollution case.     Indeed, if anything, they suggest that an\n\ninjunction might be available in proper circumstances.          Our cases are\n\nplainly not entitled to stare decisis on the question of availability of an\n\ninjunction to abate a nuisance because there has been no clear and\n\ndefinitive ruling on the issue as framed in this case. I now turn to the\n\nlive-wire substantive question—whether an injunction is precluded as a\n\nmatter of law in this case at this early stage of the litigation.\n\f                                    81\n\n      6. Availability of injunction to abate nuisance in this case.\n\nAssuming injunctive relief is available in appropriate cases, as I do, the\n\nnext question is whether a nuisance action is available to the plaintiffs to\n\nabate environmental harms.        As we noted in Freeman, the Iowa\n\nlegislature has enacted a provision establishing a statutory nuisance\n\nclaim that supplements and does not supplant common law nuisance.\n\n848 N.W.2d at 67.       Further, in Freeman, it is noteworthy that a\n\ncomprehensive federal regulatory framework did not preempt state\n\nnuisance regulation. Id. at 69–70. Nuisance law is a sturdy feature of\n\nthe Iowa legal landscape.\n\n      The defendants argue that Iowa Code section 468.2(1) precludes\n\nsuch a nuisance action.      That provision provides, “The drainage of\n\nsurface waters from agricultural lands and all other lands, including\n\nstate-owned lakes and wetlands, or the protection of such lands from\n\noverflow shall be presumed to be a public benefit and conducive to the\n\npublic health, convenience, and welfare.” Iowa Code § 468.2(1).\n\n      In my view, the statute does not categorically eliminate nuisance\n\nclaims. It only establishes a presumption that the activities of a drainage\n\ndistrict are in the public interest, but that presumption may be rebutted.\n\nOur rule of thumb is that a statutory presumption is rebuttable, not\n\nconclusive, unless the legislature has clearly expressed an intent to the\n\ncontrary by saying it is conclusive.     Larsen v. Bd. of Trs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">860</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 863 (Iowa 1987) (Wolle, J., dissenting); Neighbors v.

The majority is wrong to\n\nthink otherwise.\n\n      My view is supported by an examination of other provisions of Iowa\n\nCode chapter 468 where the legislature, unlike in section 468.2(1), did\n\nuse language establishing conclusive or irrebutable presumptions.\n\f                                       82\n\nSpecifically, Iowa Code section 468.47 is entitled “Evidence—conclusive\n\npresumptions” and provides that no evidence is “competent to show that\n\nany of the lands in [a drainage] district . . . will not be benefited by [an]\n\nimprovement in some degree.”           A similar provision, with an escape\n\nclause, may be found in Iowa Code section 468.92, entitled “Conclusive\n\npresumption on appeal.” Similarly, Iowa Code section 468.171 is entitled\n\n“Conclusive presumption of legality.” This section states a final order of\n\na drainage district “shall be conclusive that all prior proceedings were\n\nregular and according to law.”\n\n       Plainly,   the   legislature   knows   how   to   establish    conclusive\n\npresumptions. It repeatedly did so in three sections of chapter 468, two\n\ninvolving a question of fact, another involving a question of law. It did\n\nnot do so in section 468.2(1). To judicially caret in the term “conclusive”\n\nin section 468.2(1) would be to rewrite the statute. We should decline\n\nthat invitation. See In re A.M., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378 (Iowa 2014) (“We are\n\nnot free to rewrite a statute in the guise of interpretation.”).\n\n       Yet, as with the issue of money damages, the question remains\n\nwhether a drainage district would have the statutory authority to comply\n\nwith a mandamus or injunction to abate a nuisance.                 The statutory\n\npowers of a drainage district include the power to engage in repairs and\n\nimprovements in a drainage district. Iowa Code § 468.126. The Code\n\nfurther provides that the powers of a drainage district are to be liberally\n\nconstrued.    Id. § 468.2; see also Clary, 135 Iowa at 495, 113 N.W. at\n\n333.   Yet, the question remains whether a drainage district may take\n\naffirmative steps to abate a nuisance under the maintain-and-repair\n\nprovisions of the statute.\n\f                                     83\n\n      Iowa Code chapter 468 has statutory provisions related to repairs\n\nand improvements.       Under the repair provision of Iowa Code section\n\n468.126(1)(a), the board of supervisors is authorized to\n\n      restore or maintain a drainage or levee improvement in its\n      original efficiency or capacity, and for that purpose may\n      remove silt and debris, repair any damaged structures,\n      remove weeds and other vegetable growth, and whatever else\n      may be needed to restore or maintain such efficiency or\n      capacity or to prolong its useful life.\n\nUnder the improvement provision of Iowa Code section 468.126(4)(a), the\n\nboard of supervisors is authorized to engage in improvements.              An\n\n“improvement” is defined as a project “to expand, enlarge, or otherwise\n\nincrease the capacity of any existing ditch, drain, or other facility above\n\nthat for which it was designed.” Iowa Code § 468.126(4).\n\n      The    question    becomes     whether    under    these     repair-and-\n\nimprovement provisions a drainage district would have authority to\n\nimplement whatever abatement measures that might be required to\n\nremove nitrates from the water which it allegedly collects and deposits in\n\nthe Raccoon River. An argument may be made that the power to abate a\n\nnuisance due to nitrate pollution does not fall into the express terms of\n\nthese statutes.   Any would-be abatement effort does not seem to be a\n\nrepair in the sense of an action to “restore or maintain a[n] . . .\n\nimprovement in its original efficiency or capacity.”      Id. § 468.126(1)(a).\n\nAnd, it can be argued that abating a nuisance is not an improvement\n\nbecause it fails to “expand, enlarge, or otherwise increase the capacity of\n\nany existing ditch, drain, or other facility.” Id. § 468.126(4).\n\n      But if the power to abate a nuisance is not expressly stated, is it\n\nnecessarily implied? See In re Estate of Frentress, 249 Iowa at 786, 89\n\nN.W.2d at 368. Iowa Code chapter 657, which has been around in one\n\nform or another for a long time, states that it is a nuisance to pollute\n\f                                     84\n\nrivers and streams.     Iowa Code § 657.2(4).    It is a crime to create or\n\ncontinue a nuisance. Id. § 657.3. There is no pollution exception in the\n\nlaw for drainage districts. Does the power to create, repair, and maintain\n\na drainage district necessarily imply the duty to comply with a generally\n\napplicable   nuisance    statute   that   includes    criminal   penalties   for\n\nnoncompliance and for which drainage districts are not exempted?\n\n      I conclude that it does.     In particular, it seems to me that the\n\nMaben case takes great pains to distinguish overflow cases, for which no\n\nremedy is available against drainage districts, from pollution cases. See\n\n187 Iowa at 1068–70, 175 N.W. at 515–16.             If there was no potential\n\nexposure of drainage districts for pollution-type claims, it would not have\n\nbeen necessary to draw the distinction. While it would be claiming too\n\nmuch to suggest that the mere fact that the Maben case distinguished\n\npollution cases is determinative on the issue before us, it does give us at\n\nleast some insight into contemporary thinking closer to the time of the\n\ncreation of drainage districts.\n\n      Further, it seems to me necessarily implied that if the drainage\n\ndistrict has the power to build a drainage system, it necessarily has the\n\npower to build it in compliance with generally applicable law affecting\n\npublic health. There are no germane exemptions from external statutory\n\nrequirements in the extensive drainage district statute. Of course, the\n\nMaben reasoning is correct in that there simply cannot be an overflow\n\nclaim because the removal of water from an area of land and introducing\n\nthat water into rivers is precisely what drainage districts do. Id. at 1063–\n\n64, 175 N.W. at 513–14. Allowing an overflow action would thus devour\n\nthe entire statute. But the fact that an overflow claim cannot be made\n\nhas no bearing at all upon the pollution claim presented in this case.\n\nFurther, the holdings in Iowa Employment Security and Polk County\n\f                                     85\n\ndemonstrate that drainage districts have duties outside the scope of Iowa\n\nCode chapter 468. See Polk County, 377 N.W.2d at 241; Iowa Emp’t Sec.,\n\n260 Iowa at 347, 149 N.W.2d at 291.\n\n      I conclude only at this juncture that an injunctive claim based\n\nupon nuisance law is not precluded as a matter of law at this early stage\n\nof the litigation.

The DMWW raises claims not with respect to the\n\nlegislature’s distribution of power, but claims related to the improper\n\nexercise of power that the legislature had conferred.\n\n      This does not mean, of course, that a court should accept the facts\n\nare as alleged by DMWW. Under my approach, DMWW would carry the\n\nburden of proving its factual allegations. Further, even if the facts are\n\nproved, I do not believe that DMWW would necessarily be entitled to an\n\ninjunction.   In my view, the drainage district defendants should be\n\nallowed to assert affirmative defenses about which we have no occasion\n\nto now opine.        An injunction is an equitable remedy.        Any court\n\nconsidering whether to grant an injunction in a nuisance case must\n\nbalance the equities by determining, among other things, the scope of the\n\nproblem and the benefits and burdens of any proposed abatement. See\n\nRonald J. Rychlak, Common-Law Remedies for Environmental Wrongs:\n\nThe Role of Private Nuisance, 59 Miss. L.J. 657, 689–93 (1989).\n\n      The majority suggests, without any instructions from the certifying\n\ncourt or factual basis in the nonexistent record, that the most efficient\n\ncost avoider may be the DMWW and not the drainage district. For busy\n\ncourts seeking to maximize efficiency, and particularly federal courts,\n\f                                    86\n\nthere is a temptation to terminate litigation prematurely based on the\n\nperceived factual merits of the underlying controversy.      Although the\n\nquestion of most efficient cost avoider may be a factor when the court\n\nconsiders whether equitable relief is appropriate at the end of the\n\nlitigation, such speculation cannot be used to slam the courthouse doors\n\non DMWW at the beginning of the litigation. And, it may also be that\n\ncertain actions that might effectively abate the nuisance are not, in fact,\n\nwithin the power of the drainage district. That possibility, however, goes\n\nto the merits of this case and cannot be used, as a matter of law, to\n\nterminate this proceeding.\n\n       For the above reasons, I conclude that DMWW should be allowed\n\nto attempt to make its case on its injunctive claim against the drainage\n\ndistrict defendants when the plaintiff seeks compliance with common\n\nand statutory environmental regulations.\n\n      V. Takings Claim Arising from Alleged Pollution of Raccoon\nRiver.\n       A. Introduction. I now turn to the question of whether DMWW\n\nmay bring a takings claim against the drainage district defendants\n\narising out of DMWW’s assertion that because of pollution their right to\n\nclean water has been impaired and that the invasion of the nitrates into\n\nthe DMWW property amounts to a trespass.\n\n       First, I consider whether DMWW, as a governmental subdivision,\n\nhas any property which may fall within the scope of property protected\n\nfrom   uncompensated     takings.    Second,   I   consider whether    one\n\ngovernmental subdivision may bring a takings claim against another\n\ngovernmental subdivision. Third, I consider whether DMWW, by alleging\n\nthat the drainage districts have polluted the Raccoon River, has alleged a\n\ntaking of a compensable property interest. Fourth, I consider whether\n\f                                     87\n\nthe legislative authorization to build drainage districts defeats the\n\ntakings claim in this case.\n\n      B. Takings Claim of Government Bodies: The Question of\n\nPrivate Property.\n\n      1. Overview. There is a relatively small body of literature and a\n\nlarge body of caselaw relating to the question of whether a governmental\n\nsubdivision may bring a takings claim which is limited to “private\n\nproperty.”   See Iowa Const. art. I, § 18 (“Private property shall not be\n\ntaken for public use without just compensation first being made . . . .”).\n\nThe prevailing view is that municipal governments may bring takings\n\nclaims when other governmental entities seize property, at least under\n\ncertain circumstances.\n\n      2. United States Supreme Court caselaw on government as holder of\n\nprivate property: A stranger in town. The United States Supreme Court\n\nhas considered the question of whether a government entity may be\n\nentitled to a takings claim when the United States seizes its property.\n\nThe central question, of course, was whether government-owned property\n\ncould be considered “private property” for purposes of the Fifth\n\nAmendment.\n\n      The Supreme Court’s key case is United States v. 50 Acres of Land,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111283\"><a href=\"/opinion/111283/united-states-v-50-acres-of-land/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111283\"><a href=\"/opinion/111283/united-states-v-50-acres-of-land/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). In 50 Acres, the\n\nSupreme Court concluded that property held by local government could\n\nbe considered private property for takings purposes under the Fifth\n\nAmendment. Id. at 31, 105 S. Ct. at 455–56, 83 L. Ed. 2d at 383. The\n\nthrust of the rationale was that the loss to the government entity may be\n\nas severe as the loss to a private person or entity. Id. at 31, 105 S. Ct. at\n\n455, 83 L. Ed. 2d at 383. According to the 50 Acres Court,\n\f                                           88\n               When the United States condemns a local public\n       facility, the loss to the public entity, to the persons served by\n       it, and to the local taxpayers may be no less acute than the\n       loss in the taking of private property. Therefore, it is most\n       reasonable to construe the reference to “private property” in\n       the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment as encompassing\n       the property of state and local governments when\n       condemned by the United States.\n\nId. at 31, 105 S. Ct. at 455–56, 83 L. Ed. 2d at 383.\n\n       The case turned on two features.             First, as indicated above, the\n\nterm “private property” was not narrowly construed but instead was\n\nsubject to a functional approach based on the impact of the deprivation\n\non local government. Second, however, one commentator has referred to\n\nthe case’s “stranger in town” aspect—namely, the fact that 50 Acres\n\ninvolved a takings claim by a municipality against a different sovereign.\n\nSee John M. Payne, Intergovernmental Condemnation as a Problem in\n\nPublic Finance, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex. L.

Ed. at 941.\n\n       Undeniably, 50 Acres and its progeny involved local government\n\ntakings claims against the federal government.                     Thus, the taking\n\nauthority was thought to be a “stranger in town” in the sense that there\n\nwas no direct legal relationship between the taker and the party suffering\n\nthe loss. 18 Yet, the case unmistakably stands for the proposition, not at\n\nall binding on state courts construing their state constitutions, that the\n\nproperty of a governmental subdivision might be considered “private\n\nproperty” for takings purposes.\n\n\n\n\n       18This assumption, of course, is questionable. Under the Supremacy Clause,\nthe state and federal governments are interconnected because valid exercises of federal\nexecutive and legislative power are binding on the states. See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.\n\f                                       89\n\n      3. State law authority on government property as “private.” State\n\ncourts have grappled with the question of whether government\n\nsubdivision property should be considered “private” for takings purposes.\n\nLike 50 Acres, the state caselaw often reflects a functional approach to\n\nthe question.\n\n      The general theory developed in the state caselaw is that when\n\ncitizens of the state have a beneficial interest in the use of public\n\nproperty there was no taking, but when property was thought to be only\n\nlocally beneficial, the taking was compensable. See Note, The Sovereign’s\n\nDuty to Compensate for the Appropriation of Public Property, 67 Colum. L.\n\nRev. 1083, 1095–96 (1967) [hereinafter The Sovereign’s Duty].            This\n\nconcept was often expressed as a distinction between “governmental” and\n\n“proprietary” purposes. Id. When a local government was deprived of\n\nproprietary property, the taking was compensable.       Id.   But when the\n\nproperty was considered governmental, there was no takings claim. Id.\n\n      The difference, as described by Judge Cooley of the Supreme Court\n\nof Michigan, is that with respect to\n\n      the property [a city] holds for its own private purposes, a city\n      is to be regarded as a constituent in State government, and\n      is entitled to the like protection of its property rights as any\n      natural person who is also a constituent.\n\nPeople ex rel.

A large body of state caselaw developed dealing\n\nwith the distinction between local government properties held in\n\ngovernmental capacities and local government properties held in\n\nproprietary capacities. See generally 1A Julius L. Sackman, Nichols on\n\nEminent Domain § 2.27, at 2–158 (3d ed. 2009) [hereinafter Nichols]\n\n(citing cases); 2 Nichols § 5.06[8], at 5–336. The dichotomous approach\n\noften led courts to make difficult factual determinations and to the\n\f                                     90\n\ndevelopment in some jurisdictions of a potentially complex classification\n\nsystem, with some types of local government property declared “in” and\n\nsome declared “out.” The Sovereign’s Duty, 67 Colum. L. Rev. at 1096–\n\n97.\n\n      Certainly the governmental/proprietary approach has its critics.\n\nJustice Frankfurter once characterized the distinction as a “quagmire\n\nthat has long plagued the law of municipal corporations.” Indian Towing\n\nCo. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105329\"><a href=\"/opinion/105329/indian-towing-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105329\"><a href=\"/opinion/105329/indian-towing-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Commentators have declared that the cases are “in\n\ndisarray” and reflect a “mindless application of labels.” Rudolph V. Parr,\n\nState Condemnation of Municipally-Owned Property: The Governmental-\n\nProprietary Distinction, 11 Syracuse L. Rev. 27, 34 (1960); Hugh D.\n\nSpitzer, Realigning the Governmental/Proprietary Distinction in Municipal\n\nLaw, 40 Seattle U. L. Rev. 173, 202–03 (2016).\n\n      The difficulties with the distinction have led some to call for a more\n\nfunctional interpretation of the term “private property” in cases involving\n\nmunicipalities.   For instance, in City of Chester v. Commonwealth, the\n\nPennsylvania court, citing federal authority, stated generally that the loss\n\nsuffered by residents of a political subdivision is no less real that the loss\n\nsuffered by private individuals as condemnees. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1502226\"><a href=\"/opinion/1502226/city-of-chester-v-com-dept-of-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (Pa.\n\n1981).    An Oregon appellate case cited the different tax bases of\n\ngovernment entities involved in takings litigation, noting that “port\n\ndistricts are . . . distinct from the state. They are supported by a distinct\n\ntax base and they serve a distinct constituency.” Brusco Towboat Co. v.\n\nState By & Through Straub, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 998 (Or. Ct. App. 1997)\n\n(en banc).    Reformers generally call for broadening, rather than\n\nrestricting, what constitutes private property, with a focus, like the\n\nOregon case, on different tax bases and constituencies. The Sovereign’s\n\f                                          91\n\nDuty, 67 Colum. L. Rev. at 1119 (“The fact of particularized loss should\n\nbe sufficient to give a right to compensation to a unit of government.”).\n\n      Most      caselaw,       however,     continues     to    adhere       to      the\n\ngovernmental/proprietary distinction. In these jurisdictions, many have\n\nconsidered   whether       a    waterworks      or   similar   utility    involves    a\n\ngovernmental or proprietary function. The vast majority of cases indicate\n\nthat a waterworks involve a proprietary function for takings clause\n\npurposes. See 2 Nichols § 5.06[8][b] n.56, at 5–340 (citing cases).\n\n      4. Iowa     caselaw       regarding      takings   of    property     held     by\n\nmunicipalities. There are only a few Iowa cases touching on the question\n\nof whether a municipality has a takings claim under article I, section 18\n\nof the Iowa Constitution. In State ex rel. White v. Barker, we stated that\n\nmunicipal corporations are entitled to constitutional protections with\n\n“respect to private and proprietary rights and interests,” and that “[i]t is\n\nquite clear that the establishment and control of waterworks for the\n\nbenefit of the inhabitants of the city” is not a public purpose but is for\n\nthe city’s private benefit such that we would regard the waterworks as a\n\nprivate corporation.   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207 (1902).

Discussion. Although the Iowa law is sparse, I conclude that\n\nDMWW may bring a takings claim against the drainage district in this\n\ncase. The approach of Barker, Miller, Stanolind, and Mid-America Pipeline\n\nsupport this conclusion.     As we have stated in a nongovernmental\n\ntakings context, the purpose of just compensation is “designed to bar\n\nGovernment from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens\n\nwhich, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a\n\nwhole.” Parkins v.

According to Nichols, the operation of a waterworks is\n\na private activity, in which municipal corporations\n\n      are mere aggregations of individuals living in the same\n      neighborhood who have banded together to supply\n      themselves with the necessities and conveniences of life . . . .\n      In this character, they are clothed with the capacities of a\n\f                                     93\n      private corporation, and may claim its rights and immunities\n      and are subject to its liabilities.\n\n1A Nichols § 2.27 at 2–159. Thus, “[t]he property acquired by municipal\ncorporations for the private benefit of their inhabitants is protected by\n\nthe constitution, and can be taken only by eminent domain, and upon\n\npayment of its value.” Id. § 2.27, at 2–163.\n\n      C. Takings Claim of Government Subdivisions Against Other\n\nGovernment Subdivisions: The Question of Standing. Closely related\n\nto the question of whether government property may be considered\n\nprivate for takings purposes is the question of whether government\n\nsubdivisions may bring takings claims against other state government\n\nentities. Some cases stand for the broad proposition that a subdivision\n\ncannot bring takings claims against other government entities on the\n\nground that the state itself created government subdivisions and that the\n\nstate cannot sue itself.      Other cases, however, consistent with the\n\ngovernmental/proprietary distinction discussed above, have held that\n\nlocal governments may bring takings claims to prevent unfair shifting of\n\nthe benefits and burdens of government.\n\n      It would be wrong, however, to conclude, as the majority seems to,\n\nthat public entities can never raise any constitutional questions in\n\nlitigation with other state entities.       There is certainly a narrow\n\nproposition   that   is   comparatively   well   established,   namely,   that\n\ngovernment subdivisions cannot challenge the constitutionality of\n\nstatutes under which they operate or under which they were created.\n\nDep’t of Revenue, 263 N.W.2d at 232.\n\n      This narrow proposition, to me, is defensible.       A county cannot\n\ncomplain that the state prohibited it from engaging in certain activities\n\nbecause the state has the power to shape the configuration of its political\n\f                                    94\n\nsubdivisions. I have applied this narrow rule with respect to claims that\n\nthe legislative action allocating power to drainage districts but failing to\n\ninclude a money-damage remedy violated various provisions of the Iowa\n\nConstitution.\n\n      But these standing cases only advance a narrow proposition,\n\nnamely, that government subdivisions cannot challenge the state’s\n\nlimitations on their own authority. The cases do not stand for a broad,\n\ngeneral proposition that government subdivisions can never raise\n\nconstitutional claims.   In my view, government subdivisions can raise\n\ntakings claims against other governmental subdivisions.\n\n      It is true, perhaps, that older caselaw contains sweeping language\n\nabout the lack of standing of government subdivisions to raise\n\nconstitutional questions. Specifically, in Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh, the\n\nSupreme Court employed language, largely dicta, suggesting that\n\ngovernment subdivisions may not raise constitutional issues in disputes\n\nagainst the state. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96718\"><a href=\"/opinion/96718/hunter-v-pittsburgh/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96718\"><a href=\"/opinion/96718/hunter-v-pittsburgh/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

According\n\nto Hunter,\n\n            It will be observed that in describing the absolute\n      power of the State over the property of municipal\n      corporations, we have not extended it beyond the property\n      held and used for governmental purposes.            Such\n      corporations are sometimes authorized to hold and do hold\n      property for the same purposes that property is held by\n      private corporations or individuals.\n\nId.\n\n      Later, in Trenton, the Supreme Court declined to apply the\n\ngovernmental/proprietary distinction in a case where a municipality\n\nsought to invoke the protections of the Federal Takings Clause against\n\nthe state. 262 U.S. at 191–92, 43 S. Ct. at 538, 67 L. Ed. at 942–43.\n\f                                     95\n\nThe Trenton Court thus held that, irrespective of the nature of the\n\nactivities of the municipality, the municipality could not invoke\n\nconstitutional protections against the state. Id.\n\n      But the Hunter–Trenton doctrine has fallen into disuse. It has not\n\nbeen employed to bar a local constitutional challenge since 1933. See\n\nNixon v. Mo. Mun.

In Gomillion, Justice\n\nFrankfurter limited the scope of Hunter and Trenton to the specific\n\nconstitutional provisions involved in those cases, namely the Contract\n\nClause, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\nUnited States Constitution.      364 U.S. at 344, 81 S. Ct. at 128, 5\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 115. According to the Court,\n\n            [A] correct reading of the seemingly unconfined dicta of\n      Hunter and kindred cases is not that the State has plenary\n      power to manipulate in every conceivable way, for every\n      conceivable purpose, the affairs of its municipal\n      corporations, but rather that the State’s authority is\n      unrestrained      by the particular prohibitions of the\n      Constitution considered in those cases.\n\nId. Additionally, the Gomillion Court noted that “[l]egislative control of\n\nmunicipalities . . . lies within the scope of relevant limitations imposed by\n\nthe United States Constitution.”      Id. at 344–45, 81 S. Ct. at 129, 5\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 115. As noted by one later federal circuit, “Hunter, Trenton,\n\nand allied cases are substantive holdings that the [Federal] Constitution\n\ndoes not interfere in states’ internal political organization. They are not\ndecisions about a municipality’s standing to sue its state.”         Rogers v.\n\nBrockette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"361917\"><a href=\"/opinion/361917/dr-ronnie-rogers-v-dr-m-l-brockette/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1069 (5th Cir. 1979); see also Michael A.\n\nLawrence, Do “Creatures of the State” Have Constitutional Rights?:\n\nStanding for Municipality to Assert Procedural Due Process Claims Against\n\nthe State, 47 Vill. L. Rev. 93, 101 (2002) [hereinafter Lawrence].\n\n      Further, the animating principle in Hunter and Trenton is that\n\nfederal courts should not consider federal constitutional claims brought\n\nby government subdivisions against the state.             In other words,\n\nconsiderations of federalism played a significant role in denying standing\n\f                                    97\n\nfor adjudication of intragovernmental disputes in state court.              Hunter\n\nand Trenton are not authority on the question of whether a government\n\nsubdivision may bring state constitutional claims in a state court against\n\nthe state.

Huls, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509013\"><a href=\"/opinion/509013/board-of-levee-commissioners-of-the-orleans-levee-board-and-howard-weil/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143 (5th Cir. 1988) (finding the concept of state suing itself\n\nuntenable in federal system).\n\n      Indeed, we have at least entertained constitutional challenges\n\nraised by local governments against state entities in contexts other than\n\nchallenges to limitations of power. For example, in City of Coralville v.\n\nIowa Utilities Board, the city challenged a tariff regime promulgated\n\npursuant to Iowa Code chapter 476 and sought to be enforced by the\n\nIowa Utilities Board.    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1785028\"><a href=\"/opinion/1785028/city-of-coralville-v-iowa-utilities-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 527 (Iowa 2008).                The city’s\n\nchallenge was in part rooted in the uniformity requirements of article I,\n\nsection 6 and article III, section 30 of the Iowa Constitution, collectively\n\nviewed as providing protection similar in scope, import, and purpose to\n\nthe equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n\nFederal Constitution. Id. at 530. We considered this challenge on the\n\nmerits, concluding under the facts and circumstances presented that\n\nthere was no constitutional infirmity. Id. at 531.\n\n      According to one authority, municipal corporations may have\n\nstanding to assert procedural due process claims against their creating\n\nstate for the deprivation of certain liberty and property interests that do\n\nnot   involve   substantive   matters    of   the   state’s   internal     political\n\norganization. See Lawrence, 47 Vill. L. Rev. at 94 n.7; Morris, 47 Harv.\n\nC.R.-C.L. L. Rev. at 43–44. This is precisely the situation that arose in\n\nCity of Coralville, 750 N.W.2d at 526.\n\n      In any event, state takings law has traditionally recognized the\n\ndistinction between proprietary and governmental functions in its state\n\f                                     98\n\nlaw and allowed municipalities to bring takings claims against other\n\ngovernmental entities. As noted above, Iowa caselaw has long recognized\n\nthe distinction between proprietary and governmental functions.        See,\n\ne.g., Stanolind, 216 Iowa at 441, 249 N.W. at 369; Scott County v.\n\nJohnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3434171\"><a href=\"/opinion/3436392/scott-county-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3434171\"><a href=\"/opinion/3436392/scott-county-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 381 (1928); Miller Grocery,\n\n195 Iowa at 1312, 192 N.W. at 307; Grefe, 139 Iowa at 30–31, 117 N.W.\n\nat 18–19; Barker, 116 Iowa at 106, 89 N.W. at 207–08. In these\n\ntraditional terms, in the context of a taking, a municipal water supplier\n\ndrawing water from a public water source is acting in a proprietary\n\ncapacity. DMWW in providing its services is not acting on behalf of the\n\nstate but as an agent of its local customers. See Morris, 47 Harv. C.R.-\n\nC.L. L. Rev. at 7. DMWW should not be regarded as an instrument of the\n\nstate, but an instrument of the citizens it serves.\n\n      Thus, while it may be that a government subdivision cannot\n\nchallenge matters related to the internal political organization of the\n\nstate, it can challenge actions of government subdivisions that allegedly\n\nrun afoul of the specific constitutional command of the takings provision\n\nof article I, section 18 of the Iowa Constitution.    Therefore, I conclude\n\nthat DMWW has standing to bring its takings claim under Iowa\n\nConstitution, article I, section 18 against the drainage district.\n\n      D. Property Interest: Riparian Water Pollution as Taking of\n\n“Property.”    According to one commentator, one of the most divisive\n\nissues in contemporary natural resource law in the United States is\n\nwhether interests in water are recognized as property. Sandra B. Zellmer\n\n& Jessica Harder, Unbundling Property in Water, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 679,\n\n681–82 (2008). Among other things, how one characterizes the “stick” is\n\ncritical in the analysis. DMWW does not assert a right to allocation of\n\nwater, but rather a riparian right of use.\n\f                                     99\n\n      The word “riparian” comes from the Latin word for “bank.” Note,\n\nPrivate Remedies for Water Pollution, 70 Colum. L. Rev. 734, 735 (1970).\n\nRiparian rights are restricted to owners of land with a bank fronting\n\nupon some point on the watercourse. Id. “Riparian rights do not depend\n\nupon ownership of the watercourse’s bed and do not include ownership\n\nof the water itself.” 1 Linda A. Malone, Riparian Rights, Environmental\n\nRegulation of Land Use § 8.2, Westlaw LWATRR (database updated Nov.\n\n2016) [hereinafter Malone].      Because of the pollution, according to\n\nDMWW, it cannot use the water without expenditure of funds to remove\n\nthe nitrates.\n\n      It may seem a right of use is somewhat intangible and a novel\n\nproperty concept. But easements across land involve a right of use and\n\nthey have long been recognized as a kind of property interest, and Iowa\n\ncaselaw supports that proposition. See Bormann v.

Com. Pl. 1959); see also Robin\n\nKundis Craig, Defining Riparian Rights as “Property” Through Takings\n\nLitigation: Is There a Property Right to Environmental Quality?, 42 Envtl.\n\nL. 115, 145 & n.232 (2012).       The leading authorities approve of this\n\napproach.       See, e.g., 3 Tiffany Real Property § 730, Westlaw (3d ed.\n\f                                    100\n\ndatabase updated 2016) [hereinafter Tiffany] (“The right of the riparian\n\nowner . . . extends to the quality as well as the quantity of the water\n\n. . . .”); 1 Malone § 8.2 (“[A] riparian has a right to the natural flow of a\n\nwatercourse without change in quantity or quality.”).\n\n      The notion of a riparian right to water quality is embraced in the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts. Section 850 provides a reasonable use\n\nrule, stating “A riparian proprietor is subject to liability for making an\n\nunreasonable use of the water of a watercourse or lake that causes harm\n\nto another riparian proprietor’s reasonable use of water or his land.”\n\nRestatement of the Law (Second) Torts § 850, at 217. Section 850A then\n\nprovides a number of factors to be considered in determining reasonable\n\nuse, including,\n\n            (a) [t]he purpose of the use,\n\n            (b) the suitability of the use to the watercourse or lake,\n\n            (c) the economic value of the use,\n\n            (d) the social value of the use,\n\n            (e) the extent and amount of the harm it causes,\n\n            (f) the practicality of avoiding the harm by adjusting\n      the use or method of use of one proprietor or the other,\n\n            (g) the practicality of adjusting the quantity of water\n      used by each proprietor,\n\n             (h) the protection of existing values of water uses,\n      land, investments and enterprises, and\n\n            (i) the justice of requiring the user causing harm to\n      bear the loss.\n\nId. § 850A, at 220; see generally 1 Malone § 8.2; A. Dan Tarlock, Law of\n\nWater Rights and Resources § 3.60, Westlaw (database updated July\n\n2016) (rejecting abstract standards or per se rules in favor of analysis of\n\f                                        101\n\nwhat uses are in fact protected based on all relevant facts and\n\ncircumstances).\n\n       As is apparent from this test, the law of nuisance and the law of\n\ntakings overlap substantially.         Many of the factors of nuisance are\n\nsimilar to those in the Restatement. The inquiry of whether a nuisance\n\nis present and whether a taking requiring just compensation has arisen\n\nare determined by a similar, fact-based inquiry. 19\n\n       The relationship between nuisance and takings law is further\n\nillustrated in our caselaw.       For instance, in Bormann, we held that a\n\nnuisance immunity provision in an agricultural land preservation statute\n\nwas an unconstitutional taking under the United States and Iowa\n\nConstitutions. 584 N.W.2d at 321. We came to a similar conclusion in\n\nGacke, where we held that a statutory grant of nuisance immunity\n\namounted to a taking of property that required payment of just\n\ncompensation. 684 N.W.2d at 175.\n\n       How the Restatement (Second) section 850A factors would play out\n\nin this litigation, of course, cannot be determined at this stage. Some of\n\nthe factors may support the drainage district defendants, while others\n\nmay support DMWW. At this time, the question of whether DMWW has a\n\nvalid property interest based on its riparian rights cannot be decided as a\n\nmatter of law, but is a question of fact.                  See 3 Tiffany § 730\n\n(“[R]easonable use of water . . . [is] one of fact.”].\n\n\n\n\n        19We have no occasion to opine now whether the test for a taking of a riparian\n\ninterest in the use of water is the same as a nuisance claim or, as suggested by one\ncommentator, somewhat more demanding. See Carlos A. Ball, The Curious Intersection\nof Nuisance and Takings Law, 86 B.U. L. Rev. 819, 878–79 (2006). Ball reads our\nBormann case as indicating that the proof required for nuisance and taking is the same\nunder Iowa law. Id. at 854–56.\n\f                                   102\n\n      E. State Authorization as Defeating Takings Claim.               The\n\nmajority suggests that because drainage districts advance legitimate\n\nstate interests, there can be no takings claim. I view this as an incorrect\n\nstatement of law.\n\n      It certainly cannot be denied that drainage districts advance\n\nlegitimate state interests.   But the argument proves too much.        For\n\nexample, a sewage treatment plant advances legitimate state interests,\n\nbut can it be said categorically that there is no taking if a sewage\n\ntreatment plant so pollutes waterways that it is no longer safe to inhabit\n\ndownstream property?

Humphrey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236–\n\n37, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715 (1906) (holding that nuisance is still a nuisance\n\neven if it comes from a “legitimate enterprise, or one of great and general\n\nconvenience and benefit”); accord Newton v.

I note with interest that\n\nwhile some nuisance statues expressly exempt “conduct done or\n\nmandated under a statute,” see, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 3482 (West,\n\nWestlaw current through 2016 Reg. Sess., ch. 8 of 2015–2016 2d Ex.\n\nSess. and all propositions on the 2016 ballot); Wash. Rev. Code Ann.\n\n§ 7.48.160 (West, Westlaw current through 2016 Reg. and 1st Special\n\nSess.). Iowa’s nuisance statute does not have such a provision.\n\n      Meiners and Yandel, authorities on law and economics, make the\n\naforementioned point by citing the classic case of Carmichael v. City of\n\nTexarkana, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (W.D. Ark. 1899). Roger Meiners & Bruce Yandle,\n\nCommon Law and the Conceit of Modern Environmental Policy, 7 Geo.\n\nMason L. Rev. 923, 945 (1999). The Carmichaels owned a forty-five-acre\n\nfarm in Texas located on the border with Arkansas. Id. at 561. The city\n\nof Texarkana, Arkansas, built a sewage plant for the city and proceeded\n\nto deposit sewage immediately opposite the plaintiffs homestead about\n\f                                   103\n\neight feet from the state line.   Id. at 562.   The defendant alleged the\n\nsewage plant created a “cesspool” and was “a great nuisance, because it\n\nfouls, pollutes, corrupts, contaminates, and poisons the water.” Id. The\n\ncourt noted that the city was operating properly under state law to build\n\nthe sewer system. Id. at 564. But the lawfulness of the system did not\n\nprevent the claim. Id. at 564–66. According to the court,\n\n      If a riparian proprietor has a right to enjoy a river so far\n      unpolluted that fish can live in it and cattle drink of it, and\n      the town council of a neighboring borough, professing to act\n      under statutory powers, pour their house drainage and the\n      filth from water-closets into the river in such quantities that\n      the water becomes corrupt and stinks, and fish will no\n      longer live in it, nor cattle drink it, the court will grant an\n      injunction to prevent the continued defilement of the stream\n      ....\n\nId. at 573.\n\n      Based on applicable caselaw, I do not think the fact that the\n\nlegislature has authorized the construction of drainage improvements\n\nmeans that a takings claim cannot be presented when a drainage district\n\nallegedly operates its drainage district in violation of the environmental\n\nlaws in Iowa Code chapter 657 and common law nuisance.\n\n      VI. Conclusion.\n\n      Based on the above reasoning, I would answer the certified\n\nquestions as follows.\n\n      Question 1: As a matter of Iowa law, does the doctrine of implied\n\nimmunity of drainage districts as applied in cases such as Fisher v.\n\nDallas County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1240629\"><a href=\"/opinion/1240629/fisher-v-dallas-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 1985), grant drainage districts\n\nunqualified immunity from all of the damage claims set forth in the\n\nComplaint (docket no. 2)?\n\n      Answer: Yes as to money damages generally.            No as to just\n\ncompensation that might arise from a takings claim.\n\f                                    104\n\n      Question 2: As a matter of Iowa law, does the doctrine of implied\n\nimmunity grant drainage districts unqualified immunity from equitable\n\nremedies and claims, other than mandamus?\n\n      Answer: No.\n\n      Question 3: As a matter of Iowa law, can the plaintiff assert\n\nprotections afforded by the Iowa Constitution’s inalienable rights, due\n\nprocess, equal protection, and takings clauses against drainage districts\n\nas alleged in the complaint?\n\n      Answer: Yes with respect to the takings clause, no with respect to\n\nall other clauses.\n\n      Question 4: As a matter of Iowa law, does the plaintiff have a\n\nproperty interest that may be the subject of a claim under the Iowa\n\nConstitution’s takings clause as alleged in the complaint?\n\n      Answer: Possibly, depending on further factual development.\n\n      In summary, I would find that DMWW’s lawsuit should be allowed\n\nto proceed. Of course, I express no view on the merits of the litigation.\n\n      Cady, C.J., joins this concurrence in part and dissent in part.\n\f</pre>",
