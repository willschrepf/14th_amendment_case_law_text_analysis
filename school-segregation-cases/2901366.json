Although the District was declared unitary and released\nfrom court supervision in 2003, some parties to the desegregation suit filed a motion\n\fin the District Court1 on February 22, 2006, asking the court to exercise ancillary\njurisdiction and enjoin the State of Missouri and state officials (collectively, \"the\nState\") from acting in a manner inconsistent with earlier court orders (including an\nagreement between the KCMSD and the State incorporated in court orders). The\nmovants (the KCMSD, a class of plaintiff schoolchildren, and the American\nFederation of Teachers Local 691) asserted that recent legislative action by the State\nviolated orders issued in the desegregation suit by requiring the KCMSD to use\nproperty tax levy proceeds, which were dedicated to the repayment of court-ordered\ndesegregation bonds, to fund charter schools. The District Court agreed, granted the\nmotion, and issued a final order enjoining the State from requiring the KCMSD to\ndivert to the charter schools tax levy funds that were traditionally withheld under\nSection 160.415.2(5) of the Missouri Revised Statutes. The State appeals the District\nCourt's order. We affirm.\n\n                                           I.\n       In 1977, the KCMSD, members of the Kansas City School Board, and four\nschoolchildren filed suit against the State, suburban school districts surrounding the\nDistrict, and various federal agencies. The complaint alleged that the defendants\ncaused and perpetuated a racially segregated public school system in the Kansas City,\nMissouri, metropolitan area. The District Court2 realigned the KCMSD as a defendant\nand converted the suit into a class action, making a plaintiff class of all present and\nfuture KCMSD students. After a 7½-month trial, the District Court dismissed the case\nagainst the suburban school districts and federal defendants, but found constitutional\nviolations by the KCMSD and the State. Jenkins v. Missouri, 593 F. Supp. 1485\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Dean Whipple, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Missouri.\n      2\n      The late Honorable Russell G. Clark, United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Missouri, presided over the case from its inception until May 1997\nwhen the case was reassigned to Judge Whipple.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f(W.D. Mo. 1984). The court determined that the State had mandated segregated\nschools for black and white children prior to 1954, id. at 1490, and held that the\nKCMSD and the State had not met their affirmative obligations to remove all vestiges\nof that dual school system, id. at 1504. We affirmed this holding in Jenkins v.\nMissouri, 807 F.2d 657 (8th Cir. 1986) (en banc) (Jenkins I),3 cert. denied, 484 U.S.\n816 (1987).\n\n       To address the vestiges of unconstitutional segregation, the District Court\nordered remedial programs and capital improvements throughout the District. By the\nsummer of 1987, the court had approved a series of capital improvement expenditures\ntotaling approximately $110 million. In September 1987, the District Court approved\na $187 million \"long-range capital improvement plan aimed at eliminating the\nsubstandard conditions present in KCMSD schools.\"4 Jenkins v. Missouri, 672\nF. Supp. 400, 403 (W.D. Mo. 1987). These capital improvement costs were in\naddition to \"other desegregation costs.\" Id. at 412. While the court had deemed the\nState and the KCMSD jointly and severally liable for desegregation remedies, the\ncourt also recognized that the KCMSD lacked the resources to pay its share of the\ncosts and had exhausted all means of raising additional revenue.5 Concluding that it\nwas \"left with no choice but to exercise its broad equitable powers\" to effectuate a\nremedy, id. at 411, the District Court directed the KCMSD to issue capital\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       This Court has heard over thirty appeals in this case. Where Roman numerals\nhave previously been assigned to the Court's opinions, we include those numeric\ndesignations.\n      4\n      The costs of capital improvements continued to multiply, and the total costs\nwere over $540 million in 1995. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 78 (1995).\n      5\n         Voters in the KCMSD had not approved a bond passage or tax levy increase\nsince 1969. See Jenkins v. Missouri, 855 F.2d 1295, 1312 (8th Cir. 1988) (Jenkins\nII), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 495 U.S. 33 (1990).\n\n                                         -3-\n\fimprovement bonds in the amount of $150 million6 and ordered the property tax levy\nin the District increased to $4.00 per $100 of assessed valuation, id. at 412–13.7 The\ncourt specifically earmarked the proceeds of the property tax increase for the\nretirement of the capital improvement bonds and ordered that a tax increase in an\namount \"required to pay the interest and principal of the bond indebtedness shall\nremain in effect until such time as the bonds are retired or until other provisions are\nadopted to insure their retirement.\" Order of Oct. 27, 1987, at 2. On appeal, we\naffirmed the issuance of the bonds. Jenkins v. Missouri, 855 F.2d 1295, 1304–07 (8th\nCir. 1988) (Jenkins II), aff'd in relevant part, 495 U.S. 33 (1990). We also affirmed\nthe District Court's action setting aside state law that limited the District's ability to\nincrease its tax levy. Id. at 1308–15. We required that in the future, however, the\namount of the levy be set by the KCMSD school board (rather than by the court),\nsubject to a limit set by the court. Id. at 1314. The Supreme Court then considered\nthe issue and, while holding that the District Court abused its discretion by setting the\nproperty tax levy itself, agreed with our proposal that the District Court authorize the\nKCMSD to levy property taxes at a rate necessary to fund the desegregation remedy\nand enjoin state laws that prevent the KCMSD from exercising this power. Missouri\nv. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 51–58 (1990). Pursuant to these orders, in 1990, the KCMSD\nincreased the levy to $4.96 per $100 of assessed valuation. See Jenkins v. Missouri,\n943 F.2d 840, 842 (8th Cir. 1991) (Jenkins VI).\n\n       The District Court—and our Court—continued to oversee the desegregation\nefforts. The case came before the Supreme Court again in 1995. In Missouri v.\nJenkins, 515 U.S. 70 (1995), the Supreme Court determined that the District Court had\nexceeded its power in ordering particular remedies. The Supreme Court found \"that\n\n\n      6\n      In 1993, the District Court approved the issuance of additional bonds totaling\n$160 million.\n      7\n       The District Court also ordered an income tax surcharge, but that order was\nreversed on appeal.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fmany goals of [the District Court's] quality education plan already have been\nattained,\" id. at 102, and directed that on remand, the District Court \"bear in mind that\nits end purpose is not only 'to remedy the violation' to the extent practicable, but also\n'to restore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that is operating\nin compliance with the Constitution,'\" id. (quoting Freeman v. Pitts 503 U.S. 467, 489\n(1992)). This order changed the direction of the case, refocusing the court and the\nparties on the goal of ending court supervision of the District.\n\n        In April 1996, the State filed a motion asking the District Court to declare the\nDistrict unitary, to dissolve all injunctions, and to relinquish jurisdiction in the case.\nLess than a month later, the State and the KCMSD entered into an agreement\n(\"Agreement\" or \"1996 Agreement\") whereby the State agreed to pay $314 million\n(later increased to $320 million) in desegregation funding to the KCMSD over a three-\nyear period. The Agreement provided that upon final payment by the State and\napproval of the Agreement by the District Court, the State would be entitled to an\norder releasing it from further desegregation obligations and the jurisdiction of the\ncourt. Consistent with the State's role throughout the remedial phase of the case, the\nAgreement focused only on the amount of funding, not on the use of the funds. The\nAmerican Federation of Teachers Local 691 (\"AFT\"), an intervener in the case, joined\nthe Agreement, but the plaintiffs did not. The State then filed a second motion asking\nthe District Court to approve the 1996 Agreement and dismiss the State from the case.\nAfter a hearing on the motions, the District Court denied the motion for unitary status\nexcept with respect to extra-curricular activities. Jenkins v. Missouri, 959 F. Supp.\n1151, 1179–80 (W.D. Mo. 1997). The District Court approved the Agreement,\nhowever, stating that it was reasonable to expect the KCMSD to be unitary within\nthree years—around the time that the State would be making final funding payments.\nId. at 1179. We affirmed the District Court's order in Jenkins v. Missouri, 122 F.3d\n588 (8th Cir. 1997) (Jenkins XIV). The State made final payment to the KCMSD\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\funder the 1996 Agreement on December 3, 1998, and the District Court8 dismissed\nthe State on January 28, 1999.\n\n        In 1998, Missouri passed legislation authorizing the creation of charter schools,\ni.e., \"independent, publicly supported school[s],\" in Kansas City and St. Louis. Mo.\nRev. Stat. § 160.400. Charter schools established within the boundaries of the\nKCMSD are funded by diverting federal, state, and local education funding away from\nthe KCMSD on a per-pupil basis.9 Id. § 160.415.2(1). Recognizing the KCMSD's\nfinancial obligations under the desegregation revenue bonds, however, the legislature\nswiftly amended the charter-schools statute in 1999 so that \"[t]he per pupil amount\npaid by a school district to a charter school [was] reduced by the amount per pupil\n. . . needed . . . for repayment of leasehold revenue bonds obligated pursuant to a\nfederal court desegregation action.\" Id. § 160.415.2(5).\n\n       In March 2002, the District Court \"declared the KCMSD unitary with regard\nto facilities, budget, transportation, and racial balance.\" Order of Mar. 29, 2002, at 22.\nWith regard to the remaining discriminatory vestige, the student achievement gap, the\nDistrict Court declared the KCMSD unitary and released it from court supervision on\nAugust 13, 2003. Am. Order of Aug. 13, 2003, at 30. The KCMSD's unitary status\nhad no immediate effect on its funding. The property tax levy remained in place, the\nKCMSD continued to make scheduled payments on the revenue bonds, and the State\ncontinued to reduce the KCMSD's funding obligations to the charter schools under\nSection 160.415.2(5).\n\n      8\n      As noted above, Judge Whipple began presiding over the case in 1997. This\nwas one of his first significant orders in the case.\n      9\n       \"The school district must pay each charter school an amount based on the total\nenrollment of the charter school multiplied by the tuition for each charter school\nstudent, multiplied by the projected daily attendance of those students.\" Jenkins v.\nSch. Dist. of Kansas City, Mo., 73 F. Supp. 2d 1058, 1065 (W.D. Mo. 1999), rev'd,\n216 F.3d 720 (8th Cir. 2000) (en banc).\n\n                                           -6-\n\f       Then, in 2004, the State changed the rules of the game. The Missouri\nlegislature enacted a new statute that authorized the Missouri Board of Fund\nCommissioners (\"BFC\")10 to condition the KCMSD's withholding of funds under\nSection 160.415.2(5) on a finding that the KCMSD did not have adequate reserves to\nsatisfy outstanding desegregation bonds:\n\n      The [BFC] shall determine whether any governmental entity has\n      sufficient fund balances to redeem leasehold revenue bonds obligated\n      under a federal desegregation action. If the [BFC] determines that any\n      governmental entity has sufficient fund balances to redeem or otherwise\n      pay off such leasehold revenue bonds, the state board of education shall\n      certify, under subdivision (5) of subsection 2 of section 160.415, RSMo,\n      that no amount is needed by such governmental entity to repay such\n      bonds.\n\nMo. Rev. Stat. § 33.315. Pursuant to the statute, the BFC met in April 2005 to\ndetermine whether the KCMSD had sufficient funds to redeem the leasehold revenue\nbonds. At the time, the balance owed on the bonds was approximately $160 million\nand the last of the bonds was not scheduled to be fully repaid until 2014. Nonetheless,\nthe BFC determined that the KCMSD had sufficient funds in its reserves to\nimmediately pay off the bonds. The Missouri Board of Education then certified that\nthe KCMSD was no longer entitled to make reductions in its per-pupil payments\nallocated to charter schools pursuant to Section 160.415.2(5). Two months later, the\nlegislature repealed Section 160.415.2(5), effective July 1, 2006. S.B. No. 287, 93rd\nGen. Assem., 1st Reg. Sess. (Mo. 2005) (\"Senate Bill 287\"). As a result of the State's\n\n\n\n\n      10\n        The BFC is comprised of Missouri's Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney\nGeneral, Auditor, Treasurer, and Commissioner of Administration. Mo. Rev. Stat. §\n33.300.\n\n                                         -7-\n\factions, in July 2006, the KCMSD was forced to begin transferring the full per-pupil\nportion of the property tax levy funds to the charter schools.11\n\n       On February 22, 2006, the KCMSD, the class of plaintiff schoolchildren, and\nintervenor AFT filed a joint motion in the District Court asking the court to exercise\nancillary jurisdiction and enforce the 1996 Agreement and court orders that\nincorporated the Agreement and established the terms of the State's dismissal from the\ncase. The movants argued that the State's dismissal was premised on the maintenance\nof the property tax levy proceeds to allow the KCMSD to repay court-ordered\ndesegregation bonds. According to the movants, the State violated the Agreement and\ncourt orders by enacting Section 33.315 and Senate Bill 287, which require the\nKCMSD to \"use levy proceeds that are devoted to the repayment of the desegregation\nbonds to fund the charter schools.\" Jt. Motion to Enforce Judgments at 2. The\nmovants asked the court to enjoin the State from \"using any portion of the per-pupil\namount needed for the repayment of leasehold revenue bonds obligated pursuant to\nthis case for the funding of charter schools or any other purpose.\" Id.\n\n       The District Court granted the motion on June 15, 2006. The court found that\n\"the dismissal of the State was granted subject to assurances of the existence of\nadequate funding for KCMSD's operations and the repayment of court-ordered\ndesegregation bonds,\" including \"the $320 million in transition payments\" and \"the\navailability of the entire property tax levy.\" Order of June 15, 2006, at 1. The court\nwas \"concerned that requiring KCMSD to transfer these funds to the charter schools\nwill impede its ability to fund its ongoing operations and continue to meet its debt\nservice obligation.\" Id. at 6. The court concluded that \"consistent with the Eighth\nCircuit's opinion approving the dismissal of the State, the State must not alter the\n\n      11\n       The District Court found that \"the amount of § 160.415.2(5) withholding from\nFY 2000 to FY 2005 has been in the range of $4M to $6M per year depending on the\nnumber of charter school students and KCMSD's debt service schedule.\" Order of\nJune 15, 2006, at 6.\n\n                                         -8-\n\ffinancial status quo until KCMSD has fully repaid its court-ordered bonds.\" Id. at 7.\nIn an amended order issued on November 21, 2006, the court further clarified that \"the\n1996 Settlement Agreement requires the State to permit KCMSD to withhold local\nproperty tax levy funds for repayment of court-ordered leasehold revenue bonds from\ntransfer to charter schools, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. § 160.415.2(5), through the\nrespective initial retirement dates of each of the court-ordered leasehold revenue bond\nobligations.\" Am. Order of Nov. 21, 2006, at 3. The court enjoined the State from\nrequiring the KCMSD to divert to the charter schools property tax levy funds that\nwere traditionally withheld under Section 160.415.2(5). The State appeals this order.\n\n                                            II.\n        Before reaching the merits of the District Court's order, we must address the\nState's argument that the District Court had no jurisdiction to consider the motion and\nenjoin the State. The District Court addressed this jurisdictional issue and determined\nthat it had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce prior orders in this case. Order of June 15,\n2006, at 3 (citing Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 379\n(1994)). We review issues of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. Myers v. Richland\nCounty, 429 F.3d 740, 745 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\n       The State's argument against jurisdiction has two related prongs, both of which\nwe reject. First, the State asserts that because the District Court declared the District\nunitary and closed the case in 2003, the court had no jurisdiction \"to impose remedies\nsome three years after such declaration.\" Br. of Appellants at 51. This argument is\nbased on the faulty premise that the District Court imposed new obligations on the\nState. As we discuss in detail below, however, the District Court did nothing more\nthan enforce existing obligations created by previous remedial orders in this case.12\nWhile a district court's jurisdiction typically ends when a case is closed and judgment\n\n      12\n       Underlying all of the State's arguments on appeal is the theory that the District\nCourt unlawfully placed new requirements on the State when the court granted the\nmotion. We reject this theory at multiple points in this opinion.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fentered, a district court retains ancillary jurisdiction to \"manage its proceedings,\nvindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.\" Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 380. The\nSupreme Court has recognized that \"[w]ithout jurisdiction to enforce a judgment\nentered by a federal court, the judicial power would be incomplete and entirely\ninadequate to the purposes for which it was conferred by the Constitution.\" Peacock\nv. Thomas, 516 U.S. 349, 356 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nWe affirm the District Court's determination that it had ancillary jurisdiction to\nenforce previous orders in this case.\n\n       This leads us to the second prong of the State's jurisdictional argument. The\nState asserts that the District Court did not have ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the\n1996 Agreement because the 1996 Agreement was simply a settlement agreement, the\nterms of which were not made part of a court order. Kokkonen made clear that\nfederal courts do not retain authority to enforce settlement agreements unless the\ndismissal order states that the district court is retaining jurisdiction over the agreement\nor the court incorporates the terms of the agreement into an order. 511 U.S. at 381.\nThe District Court reiterated that it had approved the 1996 Agreement \"as part of a\nmodified judicial order\" and noted that \"[t]he Eighth Circuit has taken the view that\nthe State was dismissed pursuant to an order of the Court modifying an earlier remedy\nand not pursuant to an unincorporated settlement agreement.\" Order of June 15, 2006,\nat 3 (citing Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 605). The District Court thus concluded that it\nhad ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Agreement as incorporated into\ncourt orders. We reach the same conclusion.\n\n       The opinions of both the District Court and this Court make it clear that the\n1996 Agreement was incorporated into the District Court's orders. Initially, the\nDistrict Court's March 25, 1997, order approving the Agreement indicated that the\nDistrict Court was modifying its earlier injunctive decrees. Jenkins v. Missouri, 959\nF. Supp. at 1172. The District Court stated that it would approve the Agreement,\nthereby releasing the State upon the payment of transitional funding, because \"[e]quity\n\n                                           -10-\n\frequires a modification of the earlier remedy.\" Id. In a later ruling on the plaintiffs'\nmotion to stay the order approving the Agreement, the District Court stated, \"Properly\nunderstood, the approval of the agreement was a court-determination to release the\nState from liability over the objections of Plaintiffs—it was not a consensual\nsettlement agreement.\" Jenkins v. Missouri, 965 F. Supp. 1295, 1302 n.11 (W.D. Mo.\n1997). The District Court has not varied from this view. In an October 2, 1997, order\ndiscussing attorney fees, the District Court was called on to \"defin[e] the nature of the\nAgreement and the relationship between it and the Order of March 25, 1997.\" Order\nof Oct. 2, 1997, at 5. The court stated: \"The Agreement and the Order of March 25,\n1997, which approved the Agreement, modified the Court's original remedial\ninjunction.\" Id. The court was persuaded \"to view the court-approved Agreement as\na judicial decree, not a contract,\" id. at 7, and to \"look to law governing judgments,\nnot contract law, to interpret and implement the Agreement and the Order of March\n25, 1997,\" id. at 7–8. The District Court concluded that \"once the Court approved the\nAgreement, its terms transformed from a contract into a court judgment.\" Id. at 17.\n\n       Our Court has also taken the view that the District Court's approval of the 1996\nAgreement was a modification of the District Court's earlier orders. In affirming the\napproval of the Agreement, we recognized the equitable power possessed by district\ncourts to modify the remedies ordered in school desegregation cases and stated that\nthe District Court \"amended the remedy\" in this case. Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 603.\nWe rejected the plaintiffs' argument that they could not be bound by the Agreement,\nstating that the District Court approved the Agreement as \"an exercise of its\ncontinuing equitable authority to devise and implement a remedy in this case\" and that\nthe District Court's order was \"not akin to a contract.\" Id. at 604 n.11. Finally, we\nnoted that the court could modify the Agreement in the future to hold the State\nresponsible for additional funding. Id. at 603.\n\n     Our review of these orders convinces us that while the District Court's\nMarch 25, 1997, order did not state explicitly that it was \"incorporating the terms of\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthe 1996 Agreement,\" that is exactly what the order did. See Schaefer Fan Co. v. J &\nD Mfg., 265 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (\"[A] district court need not use explicit\nlanguage or any magic form of words to effect a valid incorporation of an agreement\ninto an order.\" (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The circumstances\nhere are easily distinguishable from those in Kokkonen where the Supreme Court\ndeemed the district court's \"mere awareness and approval of the terms of the\nsettlement agreement\" insufficient to support ancillary jurisdiction. 511 U.S. at 381.\nAdditionally, as is clear from our discussion below, this Court's approval of the State's\ndismissal and the declaration of unitary status came only after we were confident that\nthe financial conditions in place at the time would provide adequate funding for the\nKCMSD to meet its court-ordered bond obligations. The District Court was well\nwithin its authority to exercise ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the terms of all of its\nprior orders (including the terms of the incorporated Agreement), as well as all of the\nprior orders of this Court.\n\n                                           III.\n       We proceed to consider whether the District Court, in exercising its ancillary\njurisdiction, acted appropriately in enjoining the State from requiring the District to\ndivert to charter schools the levy funds that had been dedicated to repayment of the\nDistrict's outstanding court-ordered desegregation bonds. The parties disagree on the\nstandard that we should apply in our review. The State argues that the District Court\ninterpreted and modified a settlement agreement and that such action is subject to de\nnovo review. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. N. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 451 F.3d 528,\n531 (8th Cir. 2006). The movants argue that the District Court interpreted its previous\norders and that such interpretation is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Steahr v.\nApfel, 151 F.3d 1124, 1126 (8th Cir. 1998) (ruling that we must defer to a district\ncourt's construction of its own remand order). Neither characterization of the District\nCourt's actions is completely accurate, however. As discussed above and in more\ndetail below, the District Court exercised its ancillary jurisdiction by interpreting and\nenforcing earlier remedial orders (including orders incorporating the Agreement) of\n\n                                          -12-\n\fboth the District Court (including orders authored by Judge Clark) and the Eighth\nCircuit. Vindicating the authority of both courts was an exercise of the District\nCourt's inherent power. Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 380.13 In other contexts, we have\nreviewed a district court's exercise of its inherent power for abuse of discretion. See,\ne.g., K.C. 1986 Ltd. P'ship v. Reade Mfg., 472 F.3d 1009, 1017 (8th Cir. 2007)\n(reviewing district court's refusal to consider party's argument); Greiner v. City of\nChamplin, 152 F.3d 787, 790 (8th Cir. 1998) (reviewing district court's award of\nsanctions). We believe that reviewing for abuse of the district court's discretion is\nappropriate in the context of the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction as well.14\n\n       In enjoining the State from interfering with the District's use of levy proceeds\npreviously withheld under Section 160.415.2(5) to repay court-ordered bonds, the\nDistrict Court indicated that it was enforcing both court orders and the terms of the\n1996 Agreement that were incorporated into court orders. Our review of the\nAgreement and the numerous orders in this case leads us to conclude that the District\nCourt acted properly.\n\n                                            A.\n       First, we find that the injunction was necessary to effectuate previous court\norders. Ensuring the KCMSD's ability to repay court-ordered funding obligations was\na priority for both this Court and the District Court throughout this litigation. Implicit\nin previous orders is a clear understanding that court-ordered remedies would be fully\nfunded. If we look back to 1987 when the District Court first ordered the issuance of\nthe capital improvement bonds and the property tax levy increase, we see that the\n\n      13\n         \"The cases that Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 380, 114 S. Ct. 1673, classifies as\nexamples of the second head of ancillary jurisdiction do not use the term ancillary\njurisdiction, but refer to 'inherent' or 'implied' power . . . .\" United States v. Meyer,\n439 F.3d 855, 860 n.7 (8th Cir. 2006).\n      14\n       We note, however, that our ultimate conclusion would not change were we to\napply de novo review, as the District Court acted properly in all respects.\n\n                                          -13-\n\fDistrict Court specifically required \"that the revenues from the property tax increase\n. . . be used to retire the capital improvement bonds.\" Order of Oct. 27, 1987, at 1.\nThe court directed that the portion of the tax increase \"that is required to pay the\ninterest and principal of the bond indebtedness shall remain in effect until such time\nas the bonds are retired or until other provisions are adopted to insure their\nretirement.\" Id. at 2. Although on appeal we stated that the property tax levy should\nbe used to fund other desegregation expenses in addition to retiring the bonds, we did\nnot criticize the District Court's order regarding the repayment of the bonds. Jenkins\nII, 855 F.2d at 1315.\n\n        Ten years later, when asked to approve the Agreement between the State and\nthe KCMSD releasing the State from the case, the courts again considered the\nproperty tax levy and the KCMSD's ability to fund its court-ordered desegregation\nobligations. In its order approving the Agreement, the District Court recognized that\n\"[a]ll of the parties agree that removal of the court-ordered levy would result in 'fiscal\nchaos.'\" Jenkins v. Missouri, 959 F. Supp. at 1154. While noting that its approval of\nthe Agreement would leave in place the court-ordered $4.96 levy for the three-year\ntransition period contemplated by the Agreement, the District Court warned the\nKCMSD that it was not the court's responsibility to ensure funding for the District and\ndirected the KCMSD to \"plan on being entirely self-sufficient [after the three-year\nperiod], even if that means regressing to a $2.75 levy.\" Id. at 1179. The State asks us\nto consider this dicta as evidence that the dismissal of the State was not contingent on\nthe District's continued receipt of levy funds. We decline to do so, however, because\nthe District Court's order was not the last word on the matter. In addressing two\nseparate appeals of the District Court's order, our Court took a different approach to\nfunding.\n\n      First, in an opinion addressing the plaintiffs' appeal of the District Court's\napproval of the Agreement, we stressed that funding at the \"present level\" was\n\"unquestionably critical to the continuing success of the district's programs.\" Jenkins\n\n                                          -14-\n\fXIV, 122 F.3d at 603. We stated that the continuing operation of the schools was\ndependent on the $4.96 levy, which the KCMSD was only able to establish because\nthe court enjoined the enforcement of state laws that set a lower levy limit. Id. We\nnoted, however, that the Missouri General Assembly had recently passed a joint\nresolution submitting for voter approval an amendment to the Missouri Constitution\nthat would allow the KCMSD to maintain the levy at the $4.96 level, thereby\nproviding for a means of continued funding after the District was declared unitary and\nno longer under court supervision. Id. Assured of the likelihood of continued\nfunding, we affirmed the District Court's approval of the Agreement. We concluded,\nhowever, that should \"the loss of the level of funding under the current levy . . . occur,\nit would present a changed circumstance that could call for reconsideration of the\nagreement.\" Id.\n\n        Then, in addressing the KCMSD's separate appeal of the District Court's\ndetermination that it was not the court's duty to ensure funding for the District, we\nagain recognized the KCMSD's need for sufficient funds to make payments on the\nbonds. Jenkins v. Missouri, 158 F.3d 984 (8th Cir. 1998) (Jenkins XV). We found,\nhowever, that the KCMSD's concern that \"it [was] on the brink of a funding crisis\nbecause it [was] uncertain whether it [would] have sufficient funds to retire the bonds\"\nwas alleviated for the time being because (after the appeal was argued) \"the voters of\nMissouri . . . adopted a constitutional amendment that allows the board of the KCMSD\nto set the tax rate at an amount up to $4.95 for $100 assessed valuation.\" Id. at 986\n(discussing amendment to Mo. Const. Art. 10 § 11(g)). Based on this constitutional\namendment, we stated that \"[i]t is now evident that KCMSD can raise funds to retire\nthe [court-ordered] bonds.\" Id. We recounted that the documents authorizing the\nissuance of the bonds had declared an intent that the bonds be satisfied out of an\nincrease in the property tax levy, and we stated that the constitutional amendment\n\"now gives the KCMSD board authority to maintain that part of its levy which has\nheretofore been devoted to retire its indebtedness.\" Id. (emphasis added). Because\nthe issue of funding was not ripe, we dismissed the appeal. Id. We noted, however,\n\n                                          -15-\n\fthat should state laws interfere with the adoption of a levy in the future, \"the district\ncourt could enter injunctive orders to set aside enforcement of such state laws or\nconstitutional provisions.\" Id. And we concluded that \"[s]hould efforts be made to\ndeclare the district unitary before retirement of the [bonds], the [bond repayment]\nissue can appropriately be determined at that time.\"15 Id. These two orders clearly\nindicate that we only affirmed the District Court's order approving the Agreement\nafter we were assured that sufficient funding would remain in place to enable the\nKCMSD to satisfy its desegregation obligations.\n\n       After the State made its final payment to the KCMSD under the Agreement, the\nDistrict Court entered an order dismissing the State from the case. Addressing the\nfunding issue, the District Court stated, \"The [funding] concerns expressed by the\nEighth Circuit have been addressed and eliminated by passage of H.J.R. 9[, amending\nMo. Const. Art. 10 § 11(g)], which ensures that the levy would remain at $4.95 per\n$100 by simple majority vote of the school board.\" Order of Jan. 28, 1999, at 5 n.2.\nWhile relinquishing jurisdiction over the State, the District Court also ordered the\nState to \"continue to comply with obligations, if any, that it took during the course of\nthis lawsuit and which are not covered by the Agreement itself.\" Id. at 6. The District\nCourt concluded with a warning: \"The State should be warned by its twenty-one year\ninvolvement in this case against taking any actions which might prevent the KCMSD\nfrom ultimately fulfilling its court-ordered remedial goals.\" Id.16\n\n\n\n\n      15\n        While we recognize that the KCMSD did not raise the issue at that time,\nnothing would have prompted it to do so. The State did not restrict the funds that the\nKCMSD could withhold and use to repay the bonds until after the District was\ndeclared unitary.\n      16\n        The State appears to have taken the warning to heart, as five months later it\npassed Section 160.415.2(5), permitting the KCMSD to reduce its payments to charter\nschools by the amount needed for repayment of the bonds.\n\n                                          -16-\n\f       These five orders paint a picture of the obligation that the District Court and this\nCourt placed on the State to refrain from taking any action that interferes with the\nKCMSD's ability to retire the court-ordered bonds. In granting the movants' recent\nmotion, the District Court enforced this obligation by prohibiting the State from\nrequiring the KCMSD to transfer to charter schools tax levy funds dedicated to the\nrepayment of the bonds and traditionally withheld under Section 160.415.2(5). The\nState's argument that the District Court's order somehow imposed new duties on the\nState is without merit.\n\n                                           B.\n       In addition to stopping the State from flouting the court orders themselves, the\nDistrict Court indicated that it was enforcing the 1996 Agreement, which we have\nfound incorporated into court orders and thus enforceable under the court's ancillary\njurisdiction. See discussion supra at 10–12.\n\n       The 1996 Agreement provided that the \"purpose of the [lump-sum] payments\nby the State to the KCMSD is to provide the KCMSD with a source of funds not only\nfor the next three years, but for future years.\" Agreement at ¶ 5. To effectuate that\npurpose, \"the parties agree[d] that the KCMSD shall set aside a portion of the funds\nbeing provided by the State for use in years subsequent to fiscal year 1999.\" Id. The\nmovants assert that pursuant to this provision, a portion of the $320 million paid by\nthe State remains in the KCMSD's reserves. According to the movants, the State is\nindirectly reclaiming funds that it transferred under the Agreement by requiring the\nKCMSD to divert moneys to the charter schools. With these moneys now unavailable\nto make payments on the bonds, the KCMSD will be forced to deplete its reserves to\nservice its bond obligations. We agree with the District Court's finding that implicit\nin the Agreement was the parties' expectations that the State would not reclaim the\nfunds that it was transferring under the Agreement. The District Court's order\ntherefore appropriately gave effect to this provision.\n\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\f       The District Court also considered Paragraph 8 of the Agreement, which\nrequired the parties to \"jointly support existing court-ordered financing\" (including\nthe increased property tax levy) \"until such time that the District is declared unitary.\"\nAgreement at ¶ 8. The court found that \"had KCMSD not been declared unitary in\n2003, the State would have had a continuing obligation to support KCMSD's\nretirement of the court-ordered bonds through the original maturity dates in 2014.\"\nAm. Order of Nov. 21, 2006, at 2–3. While the District Court recognized that this\nprovision per se imposed no obligation on the State after the District was declared\nunitary,17 the District Court went on to quote our 1998 opinion in which we stated,\n\"Should efforts be made to declare the district unitary before retirement [of the bonds],\nthe issue can appropriately be determined at that time.\" Jenkins XV, 158 F.3d at 986\n(dismissing the KCMSD's appeal of the District Court order approving the\nAgreement). The District Court noted that while the KCMSD did not raise the issue\nof funding at the unitary status proceedings, the KCMSD would have had no reason\nto sound the alarm at that time because the State had not yet restricted the District's\nwithholding under Section 160.415.2(5). \"Under these circumstances,\" the District\nCourt found the issue \"appropriately raised at this time.\" Am. Order of Nov. 21, 2006,\nat 3. The District Court thus relied on both the Agreement and an order of this Court\nin finding \"that the leasehold revenue bond obligations are 'court-ordered financing'\nand the State has a continuing obligation to support KCMSD's efforts to retire them\nwithin their respective initial maturation dates.\" Id. We find the District Court's\nopinion well reasoned and conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion\nin ordering the State not to interfere with the KCMSD's retirement of the bonds.\n\n\n      17\n        The State argues that the District Court should have construed Paragraph 8 as\nlimiting the State's obligation to support the levy. Reply Br. of Appellants at 24\n(noting that the parties chose not to \"set in stone the $4.96 levy for the life of the\nbonds\"). The State fails to note that the District Court did recognize that the plain\nlanguage of Paragraph 8 did not impose obligations on the State after the District was\ndeclared unitary.\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f       The State asks us to consider a third provision of the Agreement that the District\nCourt did not directly address. Paragraph 3 of the Agreement relieved the State,\nfollowing its payment of $320 million, from making any further payments \"to fund\nor otherwise provide for desegregation remedies in the KCMSD.\" Agreement at ¶ 3.\nThe State argues that the District Court's order contradicted Paragraph 3 because the\norder imposed new funding requirements on the State. This is another argument that\narises from the State's mis-characterization of the District Court's action. As we stated\nabove, the District Court's order did not require the State to provide new funding to\nthe District; rather, it simply enforced the State's long-standing obligation not to\nimpede the District's ability to use levy proceeds to retire the bonds. Thus, we reject\nthe State's argument that the District Court's order unlawfully modified the\nAgreement.\n\n                                          IV.\n       The District Court acted properly in exercising ancillary jurisdiction to enforce\ncourt orders and the incorporated Agreement. We affirm the District Court's order.\n                        _____________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\f",

Although the District was declared unitary and released\nfrom court supervision in 2003, some parties to the desegregation suit filed a motion\n\fin the District Court1 on February 22, 2006, asking the court to exercise ancillary\njurisdiction and enjoin the State of Missouri and state officials (collectively, \"the\nState\") from acting in a manner inconsistent with earlier court orders (including an\nagreement between the KCMSD and the State incorporated in court orders). The\nmovants (the KCMSD, a class of plaintiff schoolchildren, and the American\nFederation of Teachers Local 691) asserted that recent legislative action by the State\nviolated orders issued in the desegregation suit by requiring the KCMSD to use\nproperty tax levy proceeds, which were dedicated to the repayment of court-ordered\ndesegregation bonds, to fund charter schools. The District Court agreed, granted the\nmotion, and issued a final order enjoining the State from requiring the KCMSD to\ndivert to the charter schools tax levy funds that were traditionally withheld under\nSection 160.415.2(5) of the Missouri Revised Statutes. The State appeals the District\nCourt's order. We affirm.\n\n                                           I.\n       In 1977, the KCMSD, members of the Kansas City School Board, and four\nschoolchildren filed suit against the State, suburban school districts surrounding the\nDistrict, and various federal agencies. The complaint alleged that the defendants\ncaused and perpetuated a racially segregated public school system in the Kansas City,\nMissouri, metropolitan area. The District Court2 realigned the KCMSD as a defendant\nand converted the suit into a class action, making a plaintiff class of all present and\nfuture KCMSD students. After a 7½-month trial, the District Court dismissed the case\nagainst the suburban school districts and federal defendants, but found constitutional\nviolations by the KCMSD and the State.

This order changed the direction of the case, refocusing the court and the\nparties on the goal of ending court supervision of the District.\n\n        In April 1996, the State filed a motion asking the District Court to declare the\nDistrict unitary, to dissolve all injunctions, and to relinquish jurisdiction in the case.\nLess than a month later, the State and the KCMSD entered into an agreement\n(\"Agreement\" or \"1996 Agreement\") whereby the State agreed to pay $314 million\n(later increased to $320 million) in desegregation funding to the KCMSD over a three-\nyear period. The Agreement provided that upon final payment by the State and\napproval of the Agreement by the District Court, the State would be entitled to an\norder releasing it from further desegregation obligations and the jurisdiction of the\ncourt. Consistent with the State's role throughout the remedial phase of the case, the\nAgreement focused only on the amount of funding, not on the use of the funds. The\nAmerican Federation of Teachers Local 691 (\"AFT\"), an intervener in the case, joined\nthe Agreement, but the plaintiffs did not. The State then filed a second motion asking\nthe District Court to approve the 1996 Agreement and dismiss the State from the case.\nAfter a hearing on the motions, the District Court denied the motion for unitary status\nexcept with respect to extra-curricular activities.

Charter schools established within the boundaries of the\nKCMSD are funded by diverting federal, state, and local education funding away from\nthe KCMSD on a per-pupil basis.9 Id. § 160.415.2(1). Recognizing the KCMSD's\nfinancial obligations under the desegregation revenue bonds, however, the legislature\nswiftly amended the charter-schools statute in 1999 so that \"[t]he per pupil amount\npaid by a school district to a charter school [was] reduced by the amount per pupil\n. . . needed . . . for repayment of leasehold revenue bonds obligated pursuant to a\nfederal court desegregation action.\" Id. § 160.415.2(5).\n\n       In March 2002, the District Court \"declared the KCMSD unitary with regard\nto facilities, budget, transportation, and racial balance.\" Order of Mar. 29, 2002, at 22.\nWith regard to the remaining discriminatory vestige, the student achievement gap, the\nDistrict Court declared the KCMSD unitary and released it from court supervision on\nAugust 13, 2003.

The Missouri\nlegislature enacted a new statute that authorized the Missouri Board of Fund\nCommissioners (\"BFC\")10 to condition the KCMSD's withholding of funds under\nSection 160.415.2(5) on a finding that the KCMSD did not have adequate reserves to\nsatisfy outstanding desegregation bonds:\n\n      The [BFC] shall determine whether any governmental entity has\n      sufficient fund balances to redeem leasehold revenue bonds obligated\n      under a federal desegregation action. If the [BFC] determines that any\n      governmental entity has sufficient fund balances to redeem or otherwise\n      pay off such leasehold revenue bonds, the state board of education shall\n      certify, under subdivision (5) of subsection 2 of section 160.415, RSMo,\n      that no amount is needed by such governmental entity to repay such\n      bonds.\n\nMo. Rev. Stat. § 33.315. Pursuant to the statute, the BFC met in April 2005 to\ndetermine whether the KCMSD had sufficient funds to redeem the leasehold revenue\nbonds. At the time, the balance owed on the bonds was approximately $160 million\nand the last of the bonds was not scheduled to be fully repaid until 2014. Nonetheless,\nthe BFC determined that the KCMSD had sufficient funds in its reserves to\nimmediately pay off the bonds. The Missouri Board of Education then certified that\nthe KCMSD was no longer entitled to make reductions in its per-pupil payments\nallocated to charter schools pursuant to Section 160.415.2(5). Two months later, the\nlegislature repealed Section 160.415.2(5), effective July 1, 2006. S.B. No. 287, 93rd\nGen. Assem., 1st Reg. Sess. (Mo. 2005) (\"Senate Bill 287\").

The movants argued that the State's dismissal was premised on the maintenance\nof the property tax levy proceeds to allow the KCMSD to repay court-ordered\ndesegregation bonds. According to the movants, the State violated the Agreement and\ncourt orders by enacting Section 33.315 and Senate Bill 287, which require the\nKCMSD to \"use levy proceeds that are devoted to the repayment of the desegregation\nbonds to fund the charter schools.\" Jt. Motion to Enforce Judgments at 2. The\nmovants asked the court to enjoin the State from \"using any portion of the per-pupil\namount needed for the repayment of leasehold revenue bonds obligated pursuant to\nthis case for the funding of charter schools or any other purpose.\" Id.\n\n       The District Court granted the motion on June 15, 2006. The court found that\n\"the dismissal of the State was granted subject to assurances of the existence of\nadequate funding for KCMSD's operations and the repayment of court-ordered\ndesegregation bonds,\" including \"the $320 million in transition payments\" and \"the\navailability of the entire property tax levy.\" Order of June 15, 2006, at 1. The court\nwas \"concerned that requiring KCMSD to transfer these funds to the charter schools\nwill impede its ability to fund its ongoing operations and continue to meet its debt\nservice obligation.\" Id. at 6. The court concluded that \"consistent with the Eighth\nCircuit's opinion approving the dismissal of the State, the State must not alter the\n\n      11\n       The District Court found that \"the amount of § 160.415.2(5) withholding from\nFY 2000 to FY 2005 has been in the range of $4M to $6M per year depending on the\nnumber of charter school students and KCMSD's debt service schedule.\" Order of\nJune 15, 2006, at 6.\n\n                                         -8-\n\ffinancial status quo until KCMSD has fully repaid its court-ordered bonds.\" Id. at 7.\nIn an amended order issued on November 21, 2006, the court further clarified that \"the\n1996 Settlement Agreement requires the State to permit KCMSD to withhold local\nproperty tax levy funds for repayment of court-ordered leasehold revenue bonds from\ntransfer to charter schools, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. § 160.415.2(5), through the\nrespective initial retirement dates of each of the court-ordered leasehold revenue bond\nobligations.\" Am. Order of Nov. 21, 2006, at 3. The court enjoined the State from\nrequiring the KCMSD to divert to the charter schools property tax levy funds that\nwere traditionally withheld under Section 160.415.2(5). The State appeals this order.\n\n                                            II.\n        Before reaching the merits of the District Court's order, we must address the\nState's argument that the District Court had no jurisdiction to consider the motion and\nenjoin the State. The District Court addressed this jurisdictional issue and determined\nthat it had ancillary jurisdiction to enforce prior orders in this case. Order of June 15,\n2006, at 3 (citing Kokkonen v.

First, the State asserts that because the District Court declared the District\nunitary and closed the case in 2003, the court had no jurisdiction \"to impose remedies\nsome three years after such declaration.\" Br. of Appellants at 51. This argument is\nbased on the faulty premise that the District Court imposed new obligations on the\nState. As we discuss in detail below, however, the District Court did nothing more\nthan enforce existing obligations created by previous remedial orders in this case.12\nWhile a district court's jurisdiction typically ends when a case is closed and judgment\n\n      12\n       Underlying all of the State's arguments on appeal is the theory that the District\nCourt unlawfully placed new requirements on the State when the court granted the\nmotion. We reject this theory at multiple points in this opinion.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fentered, a district court retains ancillary jurisdiction to \"manage its proceedings,\nvindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.\" Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 380. The\nSupreme Court has recognized that \"[w]ithout jurisdiction to enforce a judgment\nentered by a federal court, the judicial power would be incomplete and entirely\ninadequate to the purposes for which it was conferred by the Constitution.\" Peacock\nv. Thomas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117998\"><a href=\"/opinion/117998/peacock-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nWe affirm the District Court's determination that it had ancillary jurisdiction to\nenforce previous orders in this case.\n\n       This leads us to the second prong of the State's jurisdictional argument. The\nState asserts that the District Court did not have ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the\n1996 Agreement because the 1996 Agreement was simply a settlement agreement, the\nterms of which were not made part of a court order. Kokkonen made clear that\nfederal courts do not retain authority to enforce settlement agreements unless the\ndismissal order states that the district court is retaining jurisdiction over the agreement\nor the court incorporates the terms of the agreement into an order. 511 U.S. at 381.\nThe District Court reiterated that it had approved the 1996 Agreement \"as part of a\nmodified judicial order\" and noted that \"[t]he Eighth Circuit has taken the view that\nthe State was dismissed pursuant to an order of the Court modifying an earlier remedy\nand not pursuant to an unincorporated settlement agreement.\" Order of June 15, 2006,\nat 3 (citing Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 605). The District Court thus concluded that it\nhad ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Agreement as incorporated into\ncourt orders. We reach the same conclusion.\n\n       The opinions of both the District Court and this Court make it clear that the\n1996 Agreement was incorporated into the District Court's orders. Initially, the\nDistrict Court's March 25, 1997, order approving the Agreement indicated that the\nDistrict Court was modifying its earlier injunctive decrees. Jenkins v. Missouri, 959\nF. Supp. at 1172. The District Court stated that it would approve the Agreement,\nthereby releasing the State upon the payment of transitional funding, because \"[e]quity\n\n                                           -10-\n\frequires a modification of the earlier remedy.\" Id. In a later ruling on the plaintiffs'\nmotion to stay the order approving the Agreement, the District Court stated, \"Properly\nunderstood, the approval of the agreement was a court-determination to release the\nState from liability over the objections of Plaintiffs—it was not a consensual\nsettlement agreement.\" Jenkins v. Missouri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2139277\"><a href=\"/opinion/2139277/jenkins-v-state-of-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1295</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1302 n.11 (W.D. Mo.\n1997). The District Court has not varied from this view. In an October 2, 1997, order\ndiscussing attorney fees, the District Court was called on to \"defin[e] the nature of the\nAgreement and the relationship between it and the Order of March 25, 1997.\" Order\nof Oct. 2, 1997, at 5. The court stated: \"The Agreement and the Order of March 25,\n1997, which approved the Agreement, modified the Court's original remedial\ninjunction.\" Id. The court was persuaded \"to view the court-approved Agreement as\na judicial decree, not a contract,\" id. at 7, and to \"look to law governing judgments,\nnot contract law, to interpret and implement the Agreement and the Order of March\n25, 1997,\" id. at 7–8. The District Court concluded that \"once the Court approved the\nAgreement, its terms transformed from a contract into a court judgment.\" Id. at 17.\n\n       Our Court has also taken the view that the District Court's approval of the 1996\nAgreement was a modification of the District Court's earlier orders. In affirming the\napproval of the Agreement, we recognized the equitable power possessed by district\ncourts to modify the remedies ordered in school desegregation cases and stated that\nthe District Court \"amended the remedy\" in this case. Jenkins XIV, 122 F.3d at 603.\nWe rejected the plaintiffs' argument that they could not be bound by the Agreement,\nstating that the District Court approved the Agreement as \"an exercise of its\ncontinuing equitable authority to devise and implement a remedy in this case\" and that\nthe District Court's order was \"not akin to a contract.\" Id. at 604 n.11. Finally, we\nnoted that the court could modify the Agreement in the future to hold the State\nresponsible for additional funding. Id. at 603.\n\n     Our review of these orders convinces us that while the District Court's\nMarch 25, 1997, order did not state explicitly that it was \"incorporating the terms of\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthe 1996 Agreement,\" that is exactly what the order did.

The circumstances\nhere are easily distinguishable from those in Kokkonen where the Supreme Court\ndeemed the district court's \"mere awareness and approval of the terms of the\nsettlement agreement\" insufficient to support ancillary jurisdiction. 511 U.S. at 381.\nAdditionally, as is clear from our discussion below, this Court's approval of the State's\ndismissal and the declaration of unitary status came only after we were confident that\nthe financial conditions in place at the time would provide adequate funding for the\nKCMSD to meet its court-ordered bond obligations. The District Court was well\nwithin its authority to exercise ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the terms of all of its\nprior orders (including the terms of the incorporated Agreement), as well as all of the\nprior orders of this Court.\n\n                                           III.\n       We proceed to consider whether the District Court, in exercising its ancillary\njurisdiction, acted appropriately in enjoining the State from requiring the District to\ndivert to charter schools the levy funds that had been dedicated to repayment of the\nDistrict's outstanding court-ordered desegregation bonds. The parties disagree on the\nstandard that we should apply in our review. The State argues that the District Court\ninterpreted and modified a settlement agreement and that such action is subject to de\nnovo review. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. N. Little Rock Sch.

See Steahr v.\nApfel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756987\"><a href=\"/opinion/756987/57-socsecrepser-797-unemplinsrep-cch-p-16075b-elke-steahr-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1126 (8th Cir. 1998) (ruling that we must defer to a district\ncourt's construction of its own remand order). Neither characterization of the District\nCourt's actions is completely accurate, however. As discussed above and in more\ndetail below, the District Court exercised its ancillary jurisdiction by interpreting and\nenforcing earlier remedial orders (including orders incorporating the Agreement) of\n\n                                          -12-\n\fboth the District Court (including orders authored by Judge Clark) and the Eighth\nCircuit. Vindicating the authority of both courts was an exercise of the District\nCourt's inherent power. Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 380.13 In other contexts, we have\nreviewed a district court's exercise of its inherent power for abuse of discretion. See,\ne.g., K.C. 1986 Ltd. P'ship v.

We believe that reviewing for abuse of the district court's discretion is\nappropriate in the context of the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction as well.14\n\n       In enjoining the State from interfering with the District's use of levy proceeds\npreviously withheld under Section 160.415.2(5) to repay court-ordered bonds, the\nDistrict Court indicated that it was enforcing both court orders and the terms of the\n1996 Agreement that were incorporated into court orders. Our review of the\nAgreement and the numerous orders in this case leads us to conclude that the District\nCourt acted properly.\n\n                                            A.\n       First, we find that the injunction was necessary to effectuate previous court\norders. Ensuring the KCMSD's ability to repay court-ordered funding obligations was\na priority for both this Court and the District Court throughout this litigation. Implicit\nin previous orders is a clear understanding that court-ordered remedies would be fully\nfunded. If we look back to 1987 when the District Court first ordered the issuance of\nthe capital improvement bonds and the property tax levy increase, we see that the\n\n      13\n         \"The cases that Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 380, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although on appeal we stated that the property tax levy should\nbe used to fund other desegregation expenses in addition to retiring the bonds, we did\nnot criticize the District Court's order regarding the repayment of the bonds. Jenkins\nII, 855 F.2d at 1315.\n\n        Ten years later, when asked to approve the Agreement between the State and\nthe KCMSD releasing the State from the case, the courts again considered the\nproperty tax levy and the KCMSD's ability to fund its court-ordered desegregation\nobligations. In its order approving the Agreement, the District Court recognized that\n\"[a]ll of the parties agree that removal of the court-ordered levy would result in 'fiscal\nchaos.'\" Jenkins v. Missouri, 959 F. Supp. at 1154. While noting that its approval of\nthe Agreement would leave in place the court-ordered $4.96 levy for the three-year\ntransition period contemplated by the Agreement, the District Court warned the\nKCMSD that it was not the court's responsibility to ensure funding for the District and\ndirected the KCMSD to \"plan on being entirely self-sufficient [after the three-year\nperiod], even if that means regressing to a $2.75 levy.\" Id. at 1179. The State asks us\nto consider this dicta as evidence that the dismissal of the State was not contingent on\nthe District's continued receipt of levy funds. We decline to do so, however, because\nthe District Court's order was not the last word on the matter. In addressing two\nseparate appeals of the District Court's order, our Court took a different approach to\nfunding.\n\n      First, in an opinion addressing the plaintiffs' appeal of the District Court's\napproval of the Agreement, we stressed that funding at the \"present level\" was\n\"unquestionably critical to the continuing success of the district's programs.\" Jenkins\n\n                                          -14-\n\fXIV, 122 F.3d at 603. We stated that the continuing operation of the schools was\ndependent on the $4.96 levy, which the KCMSD was only able to establish because\nthe court enjoined the enforcement of state laws that set a lower levy limit. Id. We\nnoted, however, that the Missouri General Assembly had recently passed a joint\nresolution submitting for voter approval an amendment to the Missouri Constitution\nthat would allow the KCMSD to maintain the levy at the $4.96 level, thereby\nproviding for a means of continued funding after the District was declared unitary and\nno longer under court supervision. Id. Assured of the likelihood of continued\nfunding, we affirmed the District Court's approval of the Agreement. We concluded,\nhowever, that should \"the loss of the level of funding under the current levy . . . occur,\nit would present a changed circumstance that could call for reconsideration of the\nagreement.\" Id.\n\n        Then, in addressing the KCMSD's separate appeal of the District Court's\ndetermination that it was not the court's duty to ensure funding for the District, we\nagain recognized the KCMSD's need for sufficient funds to make payments on the\nbonds. Jenkins v. Missouri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758694\"><a href=\"/opinion/758694/chinyere-jenkins-by-her-next-friend-joi-jenkins-nicholas-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1998) (Jenkins XV). We found,\nhowever, that the KCMSD's concern that \"it [was] on the brink of a funding crisis\nbecause it [was] uncertain whether it [would] have sufficient funds to retire the bonds\"\nwas alleviated for the time being because (after the appeal was argued) \"the voters of\nMissouri . . . adopted a constitutional amendment that allows the board of the KCMSD\nto set the tax rate at an amount up to $4.95 for $100 assessed valuation.\" Id. at 986\n(discussing amendment to Mo. Const. Art. 10 § 11(g)). Based on this constitutional\namendment, we stated that \"[i]t is now evident that KCMSD can raise funds to retire\nthe [court-ordered] bonds.\" Id. We recounted that the documents authorizing the\nissuance of the bonds had declared an intent that the bonds be satisfied out of an\nincrease in the property tax levy, and we stated that the constitutional amendment\n\"now gives the KCMSD board authority to maintain that part of its levy which has\nheretofore been devoted to retire its indebtedness.\" Id. (emphasis added). Because\nthe issue of funding was not ripe, we dismissed the appeal. Id. We noted, however,\n\n                                          -15-\n\fthat should state laws interfere with the adoption of a levy in the future, \"the district\ncourt could enter injunctive orders to set aside enforcement of such state laws or\nconstitutional provisions.\" Id. And we concluded that \"[s]hould efforts be made to\ndeclare the district unitary before retirement of the [bonds], the [bond repayment]\nissue can appropriately be determined at that time.\"15 Id. These two orders clearly\nindicate that we only affirmed the District Court's order approving the Agreement\nafter we were assured that sufficient funding would remain in place to enable the\nKCMSD to satisfy its desegregation obligations.\n\n       After the State made its final payment to the KCMSD under the Agreement, the\nDistrict Court entered an order dismissing the State from the case. Addressing the\nfunding issue, the District Court stated, \"The [funding] concerns expressed by the\nEighth Circuit have been addressed and eliminated by passage of H.J.R. 9[, amending\nMo. Const. Art. 10 § 11(g)], which ensures that the levy would remain at $4.95 per\n$100 by simple majority vote of the school board.\" Order of Jan. 28, 1999, at 5 n.2.\nWhile relinquishing jurisdiction over the State, the District Court also ordered the\nState to \"continue to comply with obligations, if any, that it took during the course of\nthis lawsuit and which are not covered by the Agreement itself.\" Id. at 6. The District\nCourt concluded with a warning: \"The State should be warned by its twenty-one year\ninvolvement in this case against taking any actions which might prevent the KCMSD\nfrom ultimately fulfilling its court-ordered remedial goals.\" Id.16\n\n\n\n\n      15\n        While we recognize that the KCMSD did not raise the issue at that time,\nnothing would have prompted it to do so. The State did not restrict the funds that the\nKCMSD could withhold and use to repay the bonds until after the District was\ndeclared unitary.\n      16\n        The State appears to have taken the warning to heart, as five months later it\npassed Section 160.415.2(5), permitting the KCMSD to reduce its payments to charter\nschools by the amount needed for repayment of the bonds.\n\n                                          -16-\n\f       These five orders paint a picture of the obligation that the District Court and this\nCourt placed on the State to refrain from taking any action that interferes with the\nKCMSD's ability to retire the court-ordered bonds. In granting the movants' recent\nmotion, the District Court enforced this obligation by prohibiting the State from\nrequiring the KCMSD to transfer to charter schools tax levy funds dedicated to the\nrepayment of the bonds and traditionally withheld under Section 160.415.2(5). The\nState's argument that the District Court's order somehow imposed new duties on the\nState is without merit.\n\n                                           B.\n       In addition to stopping the State from flouting the court orders themselves, the\nDistrict Court indicated that it was enforcing the 1996 Agreement, which we have\nfound incorporated into court orders and thus enforceable under the court's ancillary\njurisdiction. See discussion supra at 10–12.\n\n       The 1996 Agreement provided that the \"purpose of the [lump-sum] payments\nby the State to the KCMSD is to provide the KCMSD with a source of funds not only\nfor the next three years, but for future years.\" Agreement at ¶ 5. To effectuate that\npurpose, \"the parties agree[d] that the KCMSD shall set aside a portion of the funds\nbeing provided by the State for use in years subsequent to fiscal year 1999.\" Id. The\nmovants assert that pursuant to this provision, a portion of the $320 million paid by\nthe State remains in the KCMSD's reserves. According to the movants, the State is\nindirectly reclaiming funds that it transferred under the Agreement by requiring the\nKCMSD to divert moneys to the charter schools. With these moneys now unavailable\nto make payments on the bonds, the KCMSD will be forced to deplete its reserves to\nservice its bond obligations. We agree with the District Court's finding that implicit\nin the Agreement was the parties' expectations that the State would not reclaim the\nfunds that it was transferring under the Agreement. The District Court's order\ntherefore appropriately gave effect to this provision.\n\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\f       The District Court also considered Paragraph 8 of the Agreement, which\nrequired the parties to \"jointly support existing court-ordered financing\" (including\nthe increased property tax levy) \"until such time that the District is declared unitary.\"\nAgreement at ¶ 8. The court found that \"had KCMSD not been declared unitary in\n2003, the State would have had a continuing obligation to support KCMSD's\nretirement of the court-ordered bonds through the original maturity dates in 2014.\"\nAm. Order of Nov. 21, 2006, at 2–3. While the District Court recognized that this\nprovision per se imposed no obligation on the State after the District was declared\nunitary,17 the District Court went on to quote our 1998 opinion in which we stated,\n\"Should efforts be made to declare the district unitary before retirement [of the bonds],\nthe issue can appropriately be determined at that time.\" Jenkins XV, 158 F.3d at 986\n(dismissing the KCMSD's appeal of the District Court order approving the\nAgreement). The District Court noted that while the KCMSD did not raise the issue\nof funding at the unitary status proceedings, the KCMSD would have had no reason\nto sound the alarm at that time because the State had not yet restricted the District's\nwithholding under Section 160.415.2(5). \"Under these circumstances,\" the District\nCourt found the issue \"appropriately raised at this time.\" Am. Order of Nov. 21, 2006,\nat 3. The District Court thus relied on both the Agreement and an order of this Court\nin finding \"that the leasehold revenue bond obligations are 'court-ordered financing'\nand the State has a continuing obligation to support KCMSD's efforts to retire them\nwithin their respective initial maturation dates.\" Id. We find the District Court's\nopinion well reasoned and conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion\nin ordering the State not to interfere with the KCMSD's retirement of the bonds.\n\n\n      17\n        The State argues that the District Court should have construed Paragraph 8 as\nlimiting the State's obligation to support the levy. Reply Br. of Appellants at 24\n(noting that the parties chose not to \"set in stone the $4.96 levy for the life of the\nbonds\"). The State fails to note that the District Court did recognize that the plain\nlanguage of Paragraph 8 did not impose obligations on the State after the District was\ndeclared unitary.\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f       The State asks us to consider a third provision of the Agreement that the District\nCourt did not directly address. Paragraph 3 of the Agreement relieved the State,\nfollowing its payment of $320 million, from making any further payments \"to fund\nor otherwise provide for desegregation remedies in the KCMSD.\" Agreement at ¶ 3.\nThe State argues that the District Court's order contradicted Paragraph 3 because the\norder imposed new funding requirements on the State. This is another argument that\narises from the State's mis-characterization of the District Court's action. As we stated\nabove, the District Court's order did not require the State to provide new funding to\nthe District; rather, it simply enforced the State's long-standing obligation not to\nimpede the District's ability to use levy proceeds to retire the bonds. Thus, we reject\nthe State's argument that the District Court's order unlawfully modified the\nAgreement.\n\n                                          IV.\n       The District Court acted properly in exercising ancillary jurisdiction to enforce\ncourt orders and the incorporated Agreement. We affirm the District Court's order.\n                        _____________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\f</pre>",
