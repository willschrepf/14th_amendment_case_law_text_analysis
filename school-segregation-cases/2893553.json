As Blake’s contentions are without merit, we\n\nwill affirm his conviction.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       While awaiting trial on unrelated criminal charges, Blake was detained at the\n\nGolden Grove Correctional Facility (Golden Grove) on St. Croix. All detainees at Golden\n\n\n\n       1\n         The statute punishes “[w]hoever . . . being an inmate of a prison, makes,\npossesses, or obtains, or attempts to make or obtain, a prohibited object. . . .” 18 U.S.C. §\n1791(a)(2). After providing a list of various “prohibited object[s],” including “firearm[s]\nor destructive device[s],” “marijuana,” and “any United States or foreign currency,” the\nstatute has a catchall provision, prohibiting: “any other object that threatens the order,\ndiscipline, or security of a prison, or the life, health, or safety of an individual.” 18\nU.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(F). This federal statute does not apply to all institutions, however.\nRather, “the term ‘prison’ means a Federal correctional, detention, or penal facility or any\nprison, institution, or facility in which persons are held in custody by direction of or\npursuant to a contract or agreement with the Attorney General.” 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(4).\n\n\n                                              2\n\fGrove receive a Detainee Handbook stating the facility’s rules and regulations. The\n\nHandbook prohibits, inter alia, possession of contraband, including “cell phones and\n\npagers.” Appendix (App.) 23. Indeed, “[a]ll unauthorized items are considered\n\ncontraband when in the possession of a detainee or visitor even if the items are not\n\ninherently illegal.” Id. According to the Handbook, possession of a cell phone subjects\n\nan inmate to “90 to 120 days Punitive Segregation,” while possession of all contraband\n\nnot specifically enumerated carries a 60 to 90 day period of punitive segregation. Id. at\n\n21.\n\n       On November 3, 2006, as Blake exited his cell, Bureau of Corrections Officer\n\nDaveson James smelled a strong odor of marijuana on Blake and another prisoner.\n\nOfficer James searched Blake’s belongings, which included a pair of gray Fila sneakers.\n\nHidden inside the right shoe, the officer found a cell phone. Inside the left shoe, the\n\nofficer found a cell phone charger. Blake was subsequently indicted for possessing these\n\nprohibited objects.\n\n       Before trial, Blake moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the contraband\n\nstatute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to his conduct. Moreover, the only notice\n\nhe was given that he could not possess these objects—the Detainee Handbook—provided\n\nthat the sanction for such possession was administrative (non-criminal) segregation.\n\nNevertheless, the District Court denied Blake’s motion.\n\n       At the end of trial, Blake moved for a judgment of acquittal, repeating his claim\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fthat the statute was void for vagueness, and asserting that the Government failed to show\n\nboth that Golden Grove is a prison under 18 U.S.C. § 1791 and that Blake possessed the\n\ncell phone and charger in question.2 The Court denied Blake’s motion and sentenced him\n\nto six months imprisonment and a $100 penalty.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       In addressing Blake’s motion to dismiss the indictment, “[o]ur standard of review\n\nis mixed. We exercise plenary review over the district court’s legal conclusions, and\n\nreview any challenges to the court’s factual findings for clear error.” United States v.\n\nNolan-Cooper, 155 F.3d 221, 229 (3d Cir. 1998); see United States v. Barbosa, 271 F.3d\n\n438, 469 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\n       By contrast, we review the District Court’s denial of Blake’s motion for judgment\n\nof acquittal “de novo and independently appl[y] the same standard as the District Court.”\n\nUnited States v. Bobb, 471 F.3d 491, 494 (3d Cir. 2006). As such, we “‘review the\n\nrecord in the light more favorable to the prosecution to determine whether any rational\n\ntrier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on the\n\navailable evidence.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Wolfe, 245 F.3d 257, 262 (3d Cir.\n\n2001)); see also United States v. McNeill, 887 F.2d 448, 450 (3d Cir. 1990) (“Only when\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        Blake has apparently chosen to abandon this lack-of-possession argument on\nappeal. Accordingly, we consider it waived. See Laborers’ Intern. Union of N.A., AFL-\nCIO v. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp., 26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\n                                             4\n\fthe record contains no evidence, regardless of how it is weighted, from which the jury\n\ncould find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, may an appellate court overturn the verdict.”).\n\n       The District Court of the Virgin Islands had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                            III.\n\n       Blake first contends that because of § 1791’s ambiguous catchall provision, he was\n\n“never on notice, while housed at Golden Grove . . . that he was subject to any rules or\n\nregulations of the Federal government regarding possession of a cell phone or cell phone\n\ncharger.” Appellant Br. at 11. A defendant is deemed to have fair notice of an offense if\n\nthe relevant statute defines the offense “with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people\n\ncan understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage\n\narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357\n\n(1983); Trade Waste Mgmt. Ass’n, Inc. v. Hughey, 780 F.2d 221, 235 (3d Cir. 1985)\n\n(explaining the two criteria for evaluating a vagueness challenge). This analysis should\n\nbe conducted bearing in mind the context in which the statute is applied. See United\n\nStates v. Chatman, 538 F.2d 567, 569 (4th Cir. 1976) (“Were the statute in question here\n\nan ordinary criminal statute we might feel constrained to hold that it runs afoul of the\n\nwell-established void-for-vagueness doctrine. In this case, however, we must construe\n\nthe statute while bearing in mind the unique environment in which it is designed to\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\foperate.”).3 Given the unique prison context in which the statute is applied, the ordinary\n\nperson would know that possessing a cell phone and a charger in prison “threatens the\n\norder, discipline, or security” of that institution. 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(F); see Boyce\n\nMotor Lines v. United States, 342 U.S. 337, 340 (1952); Chatman, 538 F.2d at 569.\n\n       To begin with, the risks presented when inmates possess cell phones and cell\n\nphone chargers are patent. For example, as Gary Evans, the Chief of Programs at the\n\nVirgin Islands Bureau of Corrections, explained at trial, “a cell phone is something that is\n\na threat to the security of any institution . . . someone with a cell phone could notify\n\nsomeone on the outside when they’re traveling . . . [t]hey could intimidate witnesses, they\n\ncould, if there is a particular employee they don’t like, they could try to send someone\n\nafter than employee.” App. 64-65. So too, a cell phone charger “[c]ould be used as a\n\nstrangling device. If you wrap the cord around someone’s neck, you could strangle them.\n\nYou could also hang yourself with it. So it’s not something that we allow in the\n\ninstitution.” App. 65. Indeed, risks like those highlighted by Chief Evans continually\n\nplay out in real life. See, e.g., Sylvester v. Goord, 828 N.Y.S.2d 729 (3d Dep’t 2007)\n\n(prison inmate received cell phones intended to be used in connection with an escape).\n\n\n\n       3\n         The Chatman court further explained, regarding a previous version of § 1791: “A\nfederal penal institution has particular needs, and statutes designed to regulate articles\nbeing introduced into such institutions must be scrutinized in light of those needs.\nPragmatically speaking, it would be virtually impossible for a single statute to catalogue\nthe numerous items which must be prohibited in the interest of prison safety and security.\nAccordingly, we hold that § 1791 is not unduly vague or overbroad when viewed in the\ncontext of the highly distinctive prison milieu.” Id.\n\n                                              6\n\fFor this reason, each detainee at Golden Grove receives, and signs a document\n\nacknowledging receipt of, the Detainee Handbook. The Handbook states quite clearly\n\nthat unauthorized items possessed by inmates (including cell phones in particular) are\n\nconsidered contraband.\n\n       Moreover, during the last several years, media outlets have documented the\n\ngrowing problem of, and dangers associated with, prisoners possessing cell phones. See\n\nFox Butterfield, Inmates Smuggled Cellphones to Maintain a Foot on the Outside, June\n\n21, 2004, http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/21/national/21PHON.html?ei=5007&en=ff56\n\na631ad8df615&ex=1403150400&partner=USERLAND&pagewanted=print&position=\n\n(“Prison officials across the country say inmates’ possession of cellphones is a growing\n\nand serious problem . . . One [cell phone] was found when an escaped inmate was\n\ncaptured in a wooded area near his prison. The phone may have played a role in the\n\nescape . . . [Moreover,] [l]ast year, an inmate was charged with running a drug ring from a\n\nprison in Ontario, Canada. . . .”); Laura Sullivan, Inmates Smuggle In Cell Phones with\n\nEase, October 12, 2006, http://www.npr.org/templates/story /story.php?storyId =6248833\n\n(“In several criminal cases, inmates have used cell phones to run gangs operating outside\n\nof prison, to put hits out on people, to organize drug-smuggling operations . . .”); Roya\n\nWolverson, The Latest Contraband, September 24, 2007, http://www.newsweek.com/id/4\n\n1200 (“Tiny phones equipped with cameras, Internet access and GPA navigation can help\n\norchestrate prison-break plots, drug trafficking, gang violence and harassment of former\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fvictims.”); GritsForBreakfast.com, Texas prison guards smuggle cell phones to inmates,\n\nhttp://gritsforbreakfast.blogspot.com /2006/10/texas-prison-guards-smuggle-cell.html\n\n(last visited June 19, 2008) (noting that cell phones “obviously pose a major security\n\nrisk”); MSNBC.com, Cell phones becoming new prison ‘cash’: Smuggled goods worth\n\nmore than drugs; officials worry about escape plots, http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/1249\n\n8707/ (last visited June 19, 2008) (“Cell phones are becoming a contraband problem in\n\nTexas prisons, leaving authorities to worry they may be used to plot escapes or conduct\n\ncriminal business behind bars.”); Textually.org, Inmates Smuggle Cell Phones For More\n\nThan Calling, June 30, 2007, http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2007/06/016470\n\n.htm (“If prisoners had cell phones ‘they could organize simultaneous riots in all 33\n\n[California] institutions if they wanted to.’ . . . ‘If there were some type of escape plot, it\n\ncould all be done via the internet, via instant messages.’”).\n\n       That cell phones can, and have been, used for various dangerous and unlawful\n\npurposes in the prison context is, thus, quite clear. Given these readily apparent\n\ndangerous uses, made even more conspicuous by the media’s coverage of this very issue,\n\nthe ordinary person would know that an inmate’s possession of a cell phone would\n\n“threaten the order, discipline, or security of a prison, of the life, health, or safety of an\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\findividual.” 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(F).4 Accordingly, Blake had sufficient notice of the\n\nfederal crime of which he was convicted.\n\n       As to the enforcement component of the vagueness inquiry, as Blake has attacked\n\nthe statute only as applied to his conduct (rather than facially), this inquiry is also\n\ninformed by the facts of this case. There may very well be a situation that raises serious\n\nvagueness concerns from an enforcement perspective. But applied to the possession of a\n\ncell phone and charger, objects an ordinary person would know he or she could not\n\npossess in jail, there is not a sufficient level of concern regarding the level of discretion\n\ngiven to police to render this statute unconstitutional. Cf. City of Morales v. Chicago,\n\n527 U.S. 41 (1999) (striking down an anti-loitering statute because the definition of\n\nloitering—“remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose”—was so vague that it\n\ngave Chicago police “absolute discretion . . . to determine what activities constitute[d]\n\nloitering”).\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       As a corollary to his lack-of-notice argument, Blake points to the Detainee\n\nHandbook, which provides for an administrative sanction for the possession of a cell\n\nphone.5 Since the Handbook does not mention a penalty other than an administrative\n\n\n       4\n        While the vagueness inquiry is an objective one, we note in passing that, by\nhiding the cell phone and charger in his shoes, Blake demonstrated actual knowledge that\nhe could not possess the cell phone and charger he was charged with possessing.\n       5\n      Blake notes that for some of the more serious violations described therein, the\nHandbook indicates that prison officials will “initiate criminal charges” in addition to the\n\n                                               9\n\fsanction, and indeed states that criminal charges will be initiated for more serious\n\nviolations, Blake asserts that the Government is, in essence, estopped from prosecuting\n\nhim criminally for the possession of contraband. Blake is mistaken. The Handbook\n\nstates: “You are subject to obey the laws of the United States and the Territory of the\n\nVirgin Islands. If you violate any of those laws you may be charged and tried for its\n\nviolation in the same manner as any United States citizen.” App. 20. Given this clear\n\nnotice, we reject Blake’s due process-related arguments concerning the notice provided\n\nby the Detainee Handbook.\n\n                                              V.\n\n       Addressing Blake’s final argument, section 1791(d)(4) requires the defendant be\n\n“an inmate of a prison,” with “prison” defined as “a Federal correctional, detention, or\n\npenal facility or any prison, institution, or facility in which persons are held in custody by\n\ndirection of or pursuant to a contract or agreement with the Attorney General.” 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1791(d)(4). At trial, Chief Evans testified that he knew of an agreement between the\n\nVirgin Islands Government and the United States regarding the housing of federal\n\nprisoners at Golden Grove. The agreement was in effect, Evans added, on the day Officer\n\nJames discovered Blake’s cell phone and cell phone charger. Moreover, Deputy Bissey,\n\nan employee of the United States Marshals Service, testified that he has transported Blake\n\nto and from Golden Grove, for federal court appearances, on a number of occasions.\n\n\n\nprovision for administrative sanction. See App. 20.\n\n                                              10\n\fGiven the testimony of Chief Evans and Deputy Bissey (including the fact that the United\n\nStates Marshals Service is a “bureau within the Department of Justice under the authority\n\nand direction of the Attorney General,” 28 U.S.C. § 561 (emphasis added)), and\n\nreviewing the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact\n\ncould have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Blake was taken to a “facility in which\n\npersons are held in custody by direction of or pursuant to a contract or agreement with the\n\nAttorney General.” See 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(4).\n\n                                              VI.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n       RENDELL, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n              The as-applied challenge mounted by Blake causes us to examine the\n\ncriminal statute in question in light of the prosecuted conduct, to see if the terms of the\n\nstatute are “sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct . . .\n\nwill render them liable to its penalties.” Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391\n\n(1926). Here, the statute prohibits prisoners from possessing, under pain of criminal\n\nprosecution, guns, drugs, currency, and “any other object that threatens the order,\n\ndiscipline, or security of a prison, or the life, health, or safety of an individual.” 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(F). Blake contends that this did not clearly inform him that he would\n\nbe committing a crime if he possessed a cell phone or a cell phone charger. I think he\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\fmakes a good point. The fact that one could conjure up ways in which a cell phone could\n\nbe misused would not necessarily cause “the ordinary person” to expect that a cell phone,\n\nas such, poses the ‘threat’ that the statute describes. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S.\n\n352, 357 (1983). Unlike guns, drugs, or explosives clearly listed in § 1791, cell phones\n\nhave a primarily legal and productive use. The media publicity regarding certain\n\nprisoners’ creative use of a cell phone does not render it an object that, in and of itself, the\n\nordinary person would know poses a threat to order or safety. The fact that cell phones\n\nmight be put to bad use is a reason for Congress to specifically include them–like cash,\n\nsee 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(E)–in the statute, not to read the statute to include them. The\n\ndanger posed by a cell phone charger, in and of itself, is even more remote.\n\n               Moreover, the relevance of the prohibition of cell phones in the Detainee\n\nHandbook in the prison where Blake was housed is questionable.6 It is actually a red\n\nherring, because the test is whether a person of ordinary intelligence would know the\n\nconduct was prohibited by federal criminal law, not by some other rule or regulation.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the government relies on this prohibition seems to fortify the\n\n\n\n       6\n         It should be noted that the detainee handbook does not list a cell phone charger by name.\nHowever, since the charger is not an “authorized item,” it would be deemed an “unauthorized\nitem” and fall under the handbook provision stating that “[a]ll unauthorized items are considered\ncontraband when in the possession of a detainee or visitor even if the items are not inherently\nillegal. Authorized items may also be considered contraband if those items are in excess of the\nquantity allowed into the facility.” (App. 23.) Although the statute itself provides no notice that\na cell phone charger could subject a prisoner to criminal sanctions, the majority finds that\nconstitutionally adequate notice can be found in this prohibition against “[a]ll unauthorized\nitems.”\n\n                                                12\n\fconclusion that the statute alone fails to provide adequate notice. (Interestingly, the\n\ngovernment concedes that this is the first and only criminal prosecution for this conduct,\n\nwhich is routinely subject to administrative sanctions.) Furthermore, clarity in statutes\n\nthat criminalize activity is required so as to prevent arbitrary or differing enforcement.\n\nSee Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 574 (1974); Trade Waste Mgmt. Ass’n, Inc. v.\n\nHughey, 780 F.2d 221, 235 (3d Cir. 1985) (noting that criminal enactments are subject to\n\na much stricter vagueness test than are economic regulations).7 The fact that a particular\n\nprison prohibits cell phones or cell phone chargers is of no moment in deciding what\n\nconstitutes a federal crime.8\n\n\n\n\n       7\n          The passage the majority cites from Chatman is inapposite. It was specific to a former\nversion of § 1791 that stated “[w]hoever contrary to rule or regulation promulgated by the\nAttorney General, introduces or attempts to introduce into or upon the grounds of any Federal\npenal or correctional institution . . . anything whatsoever,” 18 U.S.C. § 1791, June 25, 1948, c.\n645, 62 Stat. 786, is subject to criminal penalties. The implementing regulation added “without\nthe knowledge or consent of the warden or superintendent of such Federal penal or correctional\ninstitution is prohibited.” 28 C.F.R. § 6.1 (1975). Even though the statute in Chatman was\nbroad, it provided more notice than the provision at issue here as visitors to a prison would know\nthat bringing anything on the grounds is prohibited unless they inform or receive the permission\nof the warden or superintendent. Moreover, in this case, the statute delegates no rule-making\nauthority to the Golden Grove Facility or the Attorney General to further clarify the scope of the\nstatute.\n       8\n         Nor is Blake’s knowledge that he could not possess the cell phone and charger relevant.\nAlthough Blake knew that a cell phone was considered contraband and prohibited under Golden\nGrove’s rules, he did not have fair notice that it would result in federal criminal penalties. In\nfact, according to the detainee handbook, possession of a cell phone is to result in 90 to 120 days\nof punitive segregation. Blake’s argument is not that ignorance of the law should be a defense to\nhis conduct, but rather that, even had he read § 1791, he could not have known that possession of\na cell phone or charger would subject him to criminal penalties.\n\n\n                                                13\n\f             Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s view. I would\n\nvacate Blake’s conviction because the statute is void for vagueness as applied to him.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f",

As Blake’s contentions are without merit, we\n\nwill affirm his conviction.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       While awaiting trial on unrelated criminal charges, Blake was detained at the\n\nGolden Grove Correctional Facility (Golden Grove) on St. Croix. All detainees at Golden\n\n\n\n       1\n         The statute punishes “[w]hoever . . . being an inmate of a prison, makes,\npossesses, or obtains, or attempts to make or obtain, a prohibited object. . . .” 18 U.S.C. §\n1791(a)(2). After providing a list of various “prohibited object[s],” including “firearm[s]\nor destructive device[s],” “marijuana,” and “any United States or foreign currency,” the\nstatute has a catchall provision, prohibiting: “any other object that threatens the order,\ndiscipline, or security of a prison, or the life, health, or safety of an individual.” 18\nU.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(F). This federal statute does not apply to all institutions, however.\nRather, “the term ‘prison’ means a Federal correctional, detention, or penal facility or any\nprison, institution, or facility in which persons are held in custody by direction of or\npursuant to a contract or agreement with the Attorney General.” 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(4).\n\n\n                                              2\n\fGrove receive a Detainee Handbook stating the facility’s rules and regulations. The\n\nHandbook prohibits, inter alia, possession of contraband, including “cell phones and\n\npagers.” Appendix (App.) 23. Indeed, “[a]ll unauthorized items are considered\n\ncontraband when in the possession of a detainee or visitor even if the items are not\n\ninherently illegal.” Id. According to the Handbook, possession of a cell phone subjects\n\nan inmate to “90 to 120 days Punitive Segregation,” while possession of all contraband\n\nnot specifically enumerated carries a 60 to 90 day period of punitive segregation. Id. at\n\n21.\n\n       On November 3, 2006, as Blake exited his cell, Bureau of Corrections Officer\n\nDaveson James smelled a strong odor of marijuana on Blake and another prisoner.\n\nOfficer James searched Blake’s belongings, which included a pair of gray Fila sneakers.\n\nHidden inside the right shoe, the officer found a cell phone. Inside the left shoe, the\n\nofficer found a cell phone charger. Blake was subsequently indicted for possessing these\n\nprohibited objects.\n\n       Before trial, Blake moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the contraband\n\nstatute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to his conduct. Moreover, the only notice\n\nhe was given that he could not possess these objects—the Detainee Handbook—provided\n\nthat the sanction for such possession was administrative (non-criminal) segregation.\n\nNevertheless, the District Court denied Blake’s motion.\n\n       At the end of trial, Blake moved for a judgment of acquittal, repeating his claim\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fthat the statute was void for vagueness, and asserting that the Government failed to show\n\nboth that Golden Grove is a prison under 18 U.S.C. § 1791 and that Blake possessed the\n\ncell phone and charger in question.2 The Court denied Blake’s motion and sentenced him\n\nto six months imprisonment and a $100 penalty.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       In addressing Blake’s motion to dismiss the indictment, “[o]ur standard of review\n\nis mixed. We exercise plenary review over the district court’s legal conclusions, and\n\nreview any challenges to the court’s factual findings for clear error.” United States v.\n\nNolan-Cooper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757749\"><a href=\"/opinion/757749/united-states-v-angela-nolan-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229 (3d Cir. 1998); see United States v.

This analysis should\n\nbe conducted bearing in mind the context in which the statute is applied. See United\n\nStates v. Chatman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"337596\"><a href=\"/opinion/337596/united-states-v-terry-daniel-chatman/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569 (4th Cir. 1976) (“Were the statute in question here\n\nan ordinary criminal statute we might feel constrained to hold that it runs afoul of the\n\nwell-established void-for-vagueness doctrine.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104959\"><a href=\"/opinion/104959/boyce-motor-lines-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340 (1952); Chatman, 538 F.2d at 569.\n\n       To begin with, the risks presented when inmates possess cell phones and cell\n\nphone chargers are patent. For example, as Gary Evans, the Chief of Programs at the\n\nVirgin Islands Bureau of Corrections, explained at trial, “a cell phone is something that is\n\na threat to the security of any institution . . . someone with a cell phone could notify\n\nsomeone on the outside when they’re traveling . . . [t]hey could intimidate witnesses, they\n\ncould, if there is a particular employee they don’t like, they could try to send someone\n\nafter than employee.” App. 64-65. So too, a cell phone charger “[c]ould be used as a\n\nstrangling device. If you wrap the cord around someone’s neck, you could strangle them.\n\nYou could also hang yourself with it. So it’s not something that we allow in the\n\ninstitution.” App. 65. Indeed, risks like those highlighted by Chief Evans continually\n\nplay out in real life. See, e.g., Sylvester v. Goord, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Dep’t 2007)\n\n(prison inmate received cell phones intended to be used in connection with an escape).\n\n\n\n       3\n         The Chatman court further explained, regarding a previous version of § 1791: “A\nfederal penal institution has particular needs, and statutes designed to regulate articles\nbeing introduced into such institutions must be scrutinized in light of those needs.\nPragmatically speaking, it would be virtually impossible for a single statute to catalogue\nthe numerous items which must be prohibited in the interest of prison safety and security.\nAccordingly, we hold that § 1791 is not unduly vague or overbroad when viewed in the\ncontext of the highly distinctive prison milieu.” Id.\n\n                                              6\n\fFor this reason, each detainee at Golden Grove receives, and signs a document\n\nacknowledging receipt of, the Detainee Handbook. The Handbook states quite clearly\n\nthat unauthorized items possessed by inmates (including cell phones in particular) are\n\nconsidered contraband.\n\n       Moreover, during the last several years, media outlets have documented the\n\ngrowing problem of, and dangers associated with, prisoners possessing cell phones. See\n\nFox Butterfield, Inmates Smuggled Cellphones to Maintain a Foot on the Outside, June\n\n21, 2004, http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/21/national/21PHON.html?ei=5007&en=ff56\n\na631ad8df615&ex=1403150400&partner=USERLAND&pagewanted=print&position=\n\n(“Prison officials across the country say inmates’ possession of cellphones is a growing\n\nand serious problem . . .

Given these readily apparent\n\ndangerous uses, made even more conspicuous by the media’s coverage of this very issue,\n\nthe ordinary person would know that an inmate’s possession of a cell phone would\n\n“threaten the order, discipline, or security of a prison, of the life, health, or safety of an\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\findividual.” 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(F).4 Accordingly, Blake had sufficient notice of the\n\nfederal crime of which he was convicted.\n\n       As to the enforcement component of the vagueness inquiry, as Blake has attacked\n\nthe statute only as applied to his conduct (rather than facially), this inquiry is also\n\ninformed by the facts of this case. There may very well be a situation that raises serious\n\nvagueness concerns from an enforcement perspective. But applied to the possession of a\n\ncell phone and charger, objects an ordinary person would know he or she could not\n\npossess in jail, there is not a sufficient level of concern regarding the level of discretion\n\ngiven to police to render this statute unconstitutional.

Blake is mistaken. The Handbook\n\nstates: “You are subject to obey the laws of the United States and the Territory of the\n\nVirgin Islands. If you violate any of those laws you may be charged and tried for its\n\nviolation in the same manner as any United States citizen.” App. 20. Given this clear\n\nnotice, we reject Blake’s due process-related arguments concerning the notice provided\n\nby the Detainee Handbook.\n\n                                              V.\n\n       Addressing Blake’s final argument, section 1791(d)(4) requires the defendant be\n\n“an inmate of a prison,” with “prison” defined as “a Federal correctional, detention, or\n\npenal facility or any prison, institution, or facility in which persons are held in custody by\n\ndirection of or pursuant to a contract or agreement with the Attorney General.” 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1791(d)(4). At trial, Chief Evans testified that he knew of an agreement between the\n\nVirgin Islands Government and the United States regarding the housing of federal\n\nprisoners at Golden Grove. The agreement was in effect, Evans added, on the day Officer\n\nJames discovered Blake’s cell phone and cell phone charger. Moreover, Deputy Bissey,\n\nan employee of the United States Marshals Service, testified that he has transported Blake\n\nto and from Golden Grove, for federal court appearances, on a number of occasions.\n\n\n\nprovision for administrative sanction. See App. 20.\n\n                                              10\n\fGiven the testimony of Chief Evans and Deputy Bissey (including the fact that the United\n\nStates Marshals Service is a “bureau within the Department of Justice under the authority\n\nand direction of the Attorney General,” 28 U.S.C. § 561 (emphasis added)), and\n\nreviewing the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact\n\ncould have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Blake was taken to a “facility in which\n\npersons are held in custody by direction of or pursuant to a contract or agreement with the\n\nAttorney General.” See 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(4).\n\n                                              VI.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n       RENDELL, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n              The as-applied challenge mounted by Blake causes us to examine the\n\ncriminal statute in question in light of the prosecuted conduct, to see if the terms of the\n\nstatute are “sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct . . .\n\nwill render them liable to its penalties.” Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100759\"><a href=\"/opinion/100759/connally-v-general-constr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391\n\n(1926). Here, the statute prohibits prisoners from possessing, under pain of criminal\n\nprosecution, guns, drugs, currency, and “any other object that threatens the order,\n\ndiscipline, or security of a prison, or the life, health, or safety of an individual.” 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(F). Blake contends that this did not clearly inform him that he would\n\nbe committing a crime if he possessed a cell phone or a cell phone charger.

The fact that one could conjure up ways in which a cell phone could\n\nbe misused would not necessarily cause “the ordinary person” to expect that a cell phone,\n\nas such, poses the ‘threat’ that the statute describes. See Kolender v. Lawson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357 (1983). Unlike guns, drugs, or explosives clearly listed in § 1791, cell phones\n\nhave a primarily legal and productive use. The media publicity regarding certain\n\nprisoners’ creative use of a cell phone does not render it an object that, in and of itself, the\n\nordinary person would know poses a threat to order or safety. The fact that cell phones\n\nmight be put to bad use is a reason for Congress to specifically include them–like cash,\n\nsee 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(E)–in the statute, not to read the statute to include them. The\n\ndanger posed by a cell phone charger, in and of itself, is even more remote.\n\n               Moreover, the relevance of the prohibition of cell phones in the Detainee\n\nHandbook in the prison where Blake was housed is questionable.6 It is actually a red\n\nherring, because the test is whether a person of ordinary intelligence would know the\n\nconduct was prohibited by federal criminal law, not by some other rule or regulation.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the government relies on this prohibition seems to fortify the\n\n\n\n       6\n         It should be noted that the detainee handbook does not list a cell phone charger by name.\nHowever, since the charger is not an “authorized item,” it would be deemed an “unauthorized\nitem” and fall under the handbook provision stating that “[a]ll unauthorized items are considered\ncontraband when in the possession of a detainee or visitor even if the items are not inherently\nillegal. Authorized items may also be considered contraband if those items are in excess of the\nquantity allowed into the facility.” (App. 23.) Although the statute itself provides no notice that\na cell phone charger could subject a prisoner to criminal sanctions, the majority finds that\nconstitutionally adequate notice can be found in this prohibition against “[a]ll unauthorized\nitems.”\n\n                                                12\n\fconclusion that the statute alone fails to provide adequate notice. (Interestingly, the\n\ngovernment concedes that this is the first and only criminal prosecution for this conduct,\n\nwhich is routinely subject to administrative sanctions.) Furthermore, clarity in statutes\n\nthat criminalize activity is required so as to prevent arbitrary or differing enforcement.\n\nSee Smith v.

It was specific to a former\nversion of § 1791 that stated “[w]hoever contrary to rule or regulation promulgated by the\nAttorney General, introduces or attempts to introduce into or upon the grounds of any Federal\npenal or correctional institution . . . anything whatsoever,” 18 U.S.C. § 1791, June 25, 1948, c.\n645, 62 Stat. 786, is subject to criminal penalties. The implementing regulation added “without\nthe knowledge or consent of the warden or superintendent of such Federal penal or correctional\ninstitution is prohibited.” 28 C.F.R. § 6.1 (1975). Even though the statute in Chatman was\nbroad, it provided more notice than the provision at issue here as visitors to a prison would know\nthat bringing anything on the grounds is prohibited unless they inform or receive the permission\nof the warden or superintendent. Moreover, in this case, the statute delegates no rule-making\nauthority to the Golden Grove Facility or the Attorney General to further clarify the scope of the\nstatute.\n       8\n         Nor is Blake’s knowledge that he could not possess the cell phone and charger relevant.\nAlthough Blake knew that a cell phone was considered contraband and prohibited under Golden\nGrove’s rules, he did not have fair notice that it would result in federal criminal penalties. In\nfact, according to the detainee handbook, possession of a cell phone is to result in 90 to 120 days\nof punitive segregation. Blake’s argument is not that ignorance of the law should be a defense to\nhis conduct, but rather that, even had he read § 1791, he could not have known that possession of\na cell phone or charger would subject him to criminal penalties.\n\n\n                                                13\n\f             Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s view. I would\n\nvacate Blake’s conviction because the statute is void for vagueness as applied to him.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f</pre>",
