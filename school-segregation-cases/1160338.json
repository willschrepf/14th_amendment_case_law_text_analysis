See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 841.001-841.151 (West\n\n2010 & Supp. 2013) (“SVP” statute). As defined by the Legislature, a sexually\n\nviolent predator is a person who “(1) is a repeat sexually violent offender; and (2)\n\nsuffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes the person likely to engage in a\n\npredatory act of sexual violence.” Id. § 841.003(a) (West Supp. 2013). A person is\n\n                                          1\n\fa “repeat sexually violent offender” for purposes of the SVP statute if the person is\n\nconvicted of more than one sexually violent offense, and a sentence is imposed for\n\nat least one of the offenses. Id. § 841.003(b) (West Supp. 2013). A “sexually\n\nviolent offense” includes, among other offenses, indecency with a child. See id. §\n\n841.002(8)(A) (West Supp. 2013); Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 21.11 (West 2011). A\n\nbehavioral abnormality is a “congenital or acquired condition that, by affecting a\n\nperson’s emotional or volitional capacity, predisposes the person to commit a\n\nsexually violent offense, to the extent that the person becomes a menace to the\n\nhealth and safety of another person.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §\n\n841.002(2) (West Supp. 2013).\n\n      On appeal, Butler raises three issues. First, he contends the trial court\n\ncommitted reversible error in refusing to allow him leave of court to file a third-\n\nparty petition against the Office of Violent Sex Offender Management (OVSOM).\n\nSecond, he argues that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to allow\n\nhis attorney to perform a complete cross-examination of Dr. Gaines about her “rate\n\nof error.” In his third issue, he argues that the SVP statute is facially\n\nunconstitutional. We conclude that Butler’s issues are without merit, and we affirm\n\nthe trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                               UNDERLYING FACTS\n\n      Butler was previously convicted of three separate offenses of indecency with\n\nthree different children. The first offense for which he was convicted occurred in\n\n1982 when he was seventeen and the victim was seven. Butler testified at trial that\n\nhe saw the seven-year-old girl around his apartment complex and at the pool. He\n\nwent up to her apartment while no one else was home, and fondled her, touched\n\nher genitals with his hand, and performed oral sex on her. He received a three year\n\nsentence for his first conviction, and he was released April 3, 1984, on mandatory\n\nsupervision.\n\n      Butler committed the second sexual offense on April 25, 1984, just twenty-\n\ntwo days after his release from prison for the first offense. His second victim was\n\nan eleven-year-old girl. Butler met the girl when he was jogging at a middle\n\nschool. He had been instructed to stay away from those areas as a condition of his\n\nparole. While he was on school property, he touched the child on the breasts and\n\nbuttocks. Butler pleaded guilty to indecency with a child, and he was sentenced in\n\n1984 to ten years confinement. He was released on mandatory supervision in\n\nDecember 1989.\n\n      Once released, Butler again began “hanging around” a recreational center\n\nand young children. While at the recreational center, he touched another eleven-\n\n                                        3\n\fyear-old girl. He was indicted and pleaded guilty to indecency with a child. The\n\nindictment alleged he touched the eleven-year-old girl’s genitals and breasts with\n\nthe intent to arouse and gratify his sexual desire. This was his third conviction for\n\nindecency with a child by contact. Butler was sentenced to twenty-five years in\n\nprison for the third offense and he was scheduled to be released on mandatory\n\nsupervision for that offense in August of 2013. Butler admitted that while he was\n\nin prison he had 150 disciplinaries, and 23 of those write-ups were for sexual\n\nmisconduct.\n\n      The State’s expert, Dr. Sheri Gaines, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist\n\nwith training in forensic psychiatry, testified that she reviewed Butler’s records\n\n(including the files relating to the criminal offenses) and the evaluation by the\n\npsychologist, Dr. Woodrick. Gaines also interviewed Butler and reviewed his\n\ndeposition. She testified that Butler’s “sexual deviancy is a diagnosis of pedophilia,\n\nwhich is sexual urges, acts, or behaviors toward prepubescent children.” Gaines\n\nexplained that Butler’s pedophilia is a “chronic, lifelong condition.” She also\n\ndiagnosed Butler with “antisocial personality disorder.”\n\n      In Gaines’s professional opinion, Butler has a behavioral abnormality. In\n\nresponse to the State’s questioning, she further indicated that Butler has a\n\n“behavioral abnormality today[,]” a conclusion which she reached by reviewing\n\n                                          4\n\frecords showing Butler’s “behaviors over time” and “by looking at risk factors\n\nover time[.]” She noted that Dr. Woodrick diagnosed Butler as a psychopath.\n\nGaines concurred with that diagnosis, because Butler has a history of violence, has\n\ndifficulty controlling his anger, and has a “lifelong” problem conforming his\n\nbehavior even when he is in a structured environment.\n\n      Dr. Gaines referenced two important factors that contribute to the risk that\n\nButler will reoffend with crimes of sexual violence: his sexual deviancy and his\n\nantisocial personality disorder. Other risk factors identified by Gaines include the\n\nthree prior convictions for sexually violent offenses, other allegations regarding\n\nButler’s following of children around in the neighborhood, allegations of sexually\n\nacting out as a child even before his first conviction, assaulting one or more of his\n\nvictims in a public place, selection of unrelated and stranger victims, reoffending\n\nshortly after being released from prison on parole, and blaming his victims for his\n\nbehavior.\n\n      Dr. Gaines also recognized that Butler has exhibited certain positive factors,\n\nsuch as completion of an anger management course, finding “religion” while he\n\nwas in prison, and the continued support from his mother. However, Dr. Gaines\n\nnoted that even after Butler completed the anger management course, he\n\ncommitted “staff assaults” on prison officials, has been in administrative\n\n                                         5\n\fsegregation in prison, and has committed sexual offenses in prison even after he\n\n“found religion” and after he received some counseling. According to Dr. Gaines,\n\nButler admitted he has trouble controlling his sexual urges, and he continues to\n\nblame his victims.\n\n           REFUSAL TO ALLOW THIRD-PARTY CLAIM AGAINST OVSOM\n\n      In his first issue, Butler contends the trial court erred in refusing to allow\n\nhim leave of court to file a “third-party petition” against OVSOM. OVSOM is a\n\nstate agency that “perform[s] appropriate functions related to the sex offender civil\n\ncommitment program provided under Chapter 841, Health and Safety Code,\n\nincluding functions related to the provision of treatment and supervision to civilly\n\ncommitted sex offenders.” Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 420A.010 (West 2012).\n\n      Butler’s proposed third-party petition, which seeks a declaratory judgment\n\nand injunctive relief against OVSOM, alleges that OVSOM requires offenders\n\ncommitted under Chapter 841 to reside in “secure residential facilities,” to adhere\n\nto standards that are vague, and to be subject to a commitment statute that is\n\npunitive. At the pretrial hearing on his motion for leave to file the third-party\n\npetition, Butler argued that he needed to sue OVSOM, because “[i]n order to\n\ncontest the [c]onstitutionality of the statute we need to have the agency responsible\n\nfor administering the statute. So that makes them an indispensable party. . . .”\n\n\n                                         6\n\fButler in effect argues that the SVP statute is punitive in nature and\n\nunconstitutional, as more fully reflected in his third issue. The trial court denied the\n\nmotion and concluded that an independent suit against OVSOM would be\n\npremature.\n\n      On appeal, Butler argues that the trial court misapplied the law and erred in\n\nrefusing to allow him to file his third-party petition. He contends that his position\n\nis supported by the “findings” which the Texas Supreme Court made in In re\n\nCommitment of Fisher, 164 S.W.3d 637, 656 (Tex. 2005). Specifically, Butler\n\npoints to the statement in Fisher that “[h]ad Fisher so requested, it is possible that\n\nthe trial court would have modified or removed some of the contract conditions of\n\nwhich he now complains.” Id. In Fisher, the Court suggested the possibility of\n\nmodification of the conditions even though OVSOM was not joined as a party. See\n\nid. The Court further noted that Fisher could not obtain any removal or\n\nmodification of the conditions or a determination of vagueness of those conditions,\n\nbecause he did not present such a request to the trial court. Id. It is clear that the\n\nSupreme Court was specifically referencing Fisher’s challenges to certain\n\nprovisions of the trial court’s post-trial commitment order and “Treatment and\n\nSupervision Contract” which was “appended” to the judgment that found Fisher to\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fbe a sexually violent predator. Id. Therefore, Butler has misconstrued the language\n\nin Fisher.\n\n      At the stage of the proceeding in which Butler was attempting to assert his\n\nthird-party claim, he had not yet been subjected to any commitment order, and the\n\nquestions surrounding the OVSOM terms of commitment were not at issue.\n\nMoreover, this Court has previously examined and rejected the argument regarding\n\nthe refusal of the trial court to require joinder of OVSOM. See In re Commitment\n\nof Dodson, No. 09-13-00222-CV, 2014 WL 2218718, at *5 (Tex. App.—\n\nBeaumont May 29, 2014, no pet.) (mem. op.) (“[I]t does not appear that OVSOM\n\nwould be a proper party to a proceeding that addressed the claims in Dodson’s\n\ncounterclaim, as the SVP statute does not contain a provision waiving OVSOM’s\n\ngovernmental immunity.”); see also Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 841.001-\n\n841.151. Likewise, the respective chapter of the Government Code pertaining to\n\nOVSOM does not contain a provision waiving sovereign immunity. See Tex. Gov’t\n\nCode Ann. §§ 420A.001-420A.011 (West 2012).\n\n      Butler claims, based on alleged comments from the trial court at certain\n\nhearings in this case and a comment made in another commitment case, that he\n\nmust add OVSOM as a party in order to challenge the constitutionality of Chapter\n\n841. The constitutionality of various sections of Chapter 841 has been repeatedly\n\n                                        8\n\fchallenged, and no section to date has been declared unconstitutional. See, e.g., In\n\nre Commitment of Fisher, 164 S.W.3d 637; Beasley v. Molett, 95 S.W.3d 590 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Beaumont 2002, pet. denied); In re Commitment of Mullens, 92 S.W.3d 881\n\n(Tex. App.—Beaumont 2002, pet. denied). The courts have not held that OVSOM\n\nis an indispensable party in a constitutional challenge in this context. Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant\n\nButler leave to file the third-party petition against OVSOM. The trial court could\n\nhave reasonably concluded that OVSOM was not a proper party to this suit, and\n\nOVSOM’s presence in the suit--the actual purpose of which was to establish\n\nwhether or not Butler is a sexually violent predator--would not promote an orderly\n\npresentation of the commitment proceeding. Accordingly, we overrule issue one.\n\n                       LIMITATION OF CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n      In his second issue, Butler argues that the trial court erred in denying him the\n\nright to engage in further cross-examination of Dr. Gaines relating to her “rate of\n\nerror” in SVP cases. We review a trial court’s decision concerning the admission\n\nor exclusion of evidence for an abuse of discretion. City of Brownsville v.\n\nAlvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1995). A trial court abuses its discretion if it\n\nacts without reference to guiding rules and principles, or if it acts arbitrarily and\n\nunreasonably. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549, 558\n\n\n                                          9\n\f(Tex. 1995); Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42\n\n(Tex. 1985). If we find the trial court erred, we will reverse a judgment only if the\n\ntrial court’s error probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment or\n\nprobably prevented the appellant from properly presenting the case on appeal. See\n\nTex. R. App. P. 44.1(a).\n\n      Under Rule 611(b) of the Texas Rules of Evidence, counsel may be allowed\n\nto cross-examine a witness on any matter relevant to any issue in the case,\n\nincluding credibility. Tex. R. Evid. 611(b); In re Commitment of Ramirez, No. 09-\n\n13-00176-CV, 2013 WL 5658597, at *4 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Oct. 17, 2013, no\n\npet.) (mem. op.). The trial court, however, has discretion to impose limitations on\n\nthe examination of witnesses. See Tex. R. Evid. 611(a) (“The court shall exercise\n\nreasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and\n\npresenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective\n\nfor the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3)\n\nprotect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.”); see also In re\n\nCommitment of Campbell, No. 09-11-00407-CV, 2012 WL 2451620, at **6-7\n\n(Tex. App.—Beaumont June 28, 2012, pet. denied) (mem. op.).\n\n      Furthermore, under Rule 403 of the Texas Rules of Evidence, a trial court\n\nmay exclude even relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially\n\n                                         10\n\foutweighed by the danger of “unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\n\nmisleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation\n\nof cumulative evidence.” Tex. R. Evid. 403; State v. Malone Serv. Co., 829 S.W.2d\n\n763, 767 (Tex. 1992). In applying Rule 403 in In re Commitment of Alexander, No.\n\n09-11-00650-CV, 2013 WL 5425557, at **4-6 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Sept. 26,\n\n2013, pet. denied) (mem. op.), we noted the potential for confusion of the jury in\n\nthe event that cross-examination questions concerning the expert’s rate of error in\n\nthe SVP context were permitted. We concluded that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in restricting questions regarding the expert’s rate of error, because the\n\nexpert was not making a prediction as to whether the defendant would commit a\n\nfuture act of sexual violence; rather the expert was assessing a present risk that was\n\nbased on the defendant’s history, his actuarial tests, and his interview. Id. at *5.\n\n      During cross-examination, Butler’s trial counsel asked Dr. Gaines the\n\nfollowing questions:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Q. Dr. Gaines, are you aware of your rate of error\n      in these cases?\n      A. I don’t understand the question.\n      Q. Are you aware of your accuracy rate in these cases?\n      A. Well, I still don’t understand the question, because you can’t\n      evaluate someone’s accuracy when they’re just giving an opinion. I\n      am not predicting the future. I am not saying: Oh, yes, Mr. Butler is\n      absolutely 100 percent going to reoffend. So I don’t think that’s even\n      a valid question.\n\n                                          11\n\f      Q. How many times have you stated that someone will commit an act\n      of sexual violence and they actually have went on to commit another\n      act of sexual violence?\n      [Prosecutor]: Objection, misleading.\n      THE COURT: Sustained.\n\nThereafter, Butler made the following offer of proof:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Q. Dr. Gaines, do you know what your rate of\n      error is?\n      A. I think I already asked (sic) that question. And--I already answered\n      that question. I think it’s an invalid question because I’m not making a\n      prediction. I’m not saying that something is going to happen. I’m\n      saying that something is likely to happen.\n      Q. Is that a “no,” that you don’t know what your rate [of] error is?\n      A. It’s not a “yes” or a “no.” I’m saying that, in my opinion, it’s an\n      invalid question because I’m not making a prediction.\n      Q. Would it surprise you that none of the people you stated was likely\n      to commit another act of sexual violence has never gone on to commit\n      another act of sexual violence?\n      A. It would not surprise me at all because that is the exact reason the\n      Legislature made this statute, to keep that from happening. So it\n      would lead me to believe that the statute is effective.\n\n            ....\n\n      [STATE]: If those questions are asked in front of the jury, I think we\n      need the opportunity . . . I think the door has been opened. We can\n      present evidence about the conditions of civil commitment and why\n      no one has reoffended and that they’re mandated to go to treatment\n      and they live in a structured setting and that sort of thing. I think . . .\n      the jury is entitled to have a full picture or we just don’t go down this\n      road at all.\n\n      THE COURT: . . . [I]t’s just misleading, asking has anybody ever . . .\n      offended, because we’re all sitting here knowing why that hasn’t\n      happened. So if we’re going to sit here and know why that hasn’t\n      been, that jury over there needs to know why it hasn’t happened;\n                                          12\n\f      because, otherwise, you’re making Dr. Gaines look like she’s, you\n      know, not doing a good job. And we don’t know whether she did a\n      good job or not because we never know if these people are going to\n      reoffend.\n\nButler requested that the testimony he obtained in the offer of proof be provided to\n\nthe jury, but the trial court denied the request. The trial court concluded that the\n\nobjected-to question was “misleading,” because the question failed to give the jury\n\nthe complete picture as to why a person who has been civilly committed may not\n\nhave reoffended.\n\n      The issue the jury was required to decide was whether Butler is a repeat\n\nsexually violent offender who presently suffers from a behavioral abnormality that\n\nmakes him likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. See Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code Ann. §§ 841.002(2), 841.003(a); § 841.062(a) (West 2010). For the\n\nreasons stated in In re Commitment of Alexander and the applicable factors stated\n\nin Rule 403 (danger of confusion of the issues or of misleading the jury), we\n\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the additional\n\n“rate of error” cross-examination questions that Butler sought to elicit from Dr.\n\nGaines. The limitation that the trial court placed upon the cross-examination was\n\nnot arbitrary or unreasonable. We overrule issue two.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                     FACIAL CONSTITUTIONALITY CHALLENGE\n\n      Butler argues in his final issue that “[s]ection 841 of the Texas Health &\n\nSafety Code is unconstitutional on its face[.]” However, Butler fails to specify\n\nwhich sections of Chapter 841 are unconstitutional and which constitutional rights\n\nhave been violated. He disagrees with the Texas Supreme Court in In re\n\nCommitment of Fisher where the Court states that the Texas SVP statute “imposes\n\nno physical restraint and therefore ‘does not resemble the punishment of\n\nimprisonment, which is the paradigmatic affirmative disability or restraint.’” In re\n\nCommitment of Fisher, 164 S.W.3d at 648 (quoting Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 100\n\n(2003)). Butler asserts that the Texas Supreme Court is “operating under a severe\n\nmisconception regarding civil commitment in Texas.” He argues that the Texas\n\nSVP statute is “punitive” and, therefore, the entire statute is facially\n\nunconstitutional. We have previously rejected this argument and held in Beasely,\n\n95 S.W.3d at 607-08, that Chapter 841 is not punitive in nature. See also In re\n\nCommitment of Fisher, 164 S.W.3d at 645-56. Additionally, this Court recently\n\nexamined and rejected a similar constitutional challenge to the SVP statute in In re\n\nCommitment of Dodson, 2014 WL 2218718, at **1-2 (noting that the Texas\n\nSupreme Court rejected the argument that the SVP statute is punitive in nature in\n\nIn re Commitment of Fisher). We note that Dodson also stated:\n\n\n                                        14\n\f             In Fisher, the Texas Supreme Court concluded that the types of\n      restrictions at issue were not necessarily evidence showing that the\n      statute was punitive in nature. If the restrictions themselves are not\n      necessarily punitive in nature, then their application to a person who is\n      committed is also not necessarily evidence that the restrictions have\n      been punitively applied. Id. at 648 (reasoning that the SVP statute’s\n      creating restraints, such as requiring persons to reside at particular\n      locations, to be fitted for satellite monitoring, and to be restricted in a\n      host of activities, did not “compel a conclusion that the statute is\n      punitive”). We are bound to follow Fisher until the Texas Supreme\n      Court instructs otherwise. See Lubbock Cnty., Tex. v. Trammel's\n      Lubbock Bail Bonds, 80 S.W.3d 580, 585 (Tex. 2002) (“It is not the\n      function of a court of appeals to abrogate or modify established\n      precedent.”).\n\nIn re Commitment of Dodson, 2014 WL 2218718, at *2. We overrule Butler’s\n\nfacial constitutional challenge. He has failed to demonstrate, as he must, that the\n\nstatute always operates unconstitutionally. Wilson v. Andrews, 10 S.W.3d 663, 670\n\n(Tex. 1999); see also In re Commitment of Fisher, 164 S.W.3d at 654-55.

See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 841.001-841.151 (West\n\n2010 & Supp. 2013) (“SVP” statute). As defined by the Legislature, a sexually\n\nviolent predator is a person who “(1) is a repeat sexually violent offender; and (2)\n\nsuffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes the person likely to engage in a\n\npredatory act of sexual violence.” Id. § 841.003(a) (West Supp. 2013). A person is\n\n                                          1\n\fa “repeat sexually violent offender” for purposes of the SVP statute if the person is\n\nconvicted of more than one sexually violent offense, and a sentence is imposed for\n\nat least one of the offenses. Id. § 841.003(b) (West Supp. 2013). A “sexually\n\nviolent offense” includes, among other offenses, indecency with a child. See id. §\n\n841.002(8)(A) (West Supp. 2013); Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 21.11 (West 2011). A\n\nbehavioral abnormality is a “congenital or acquired condition that, by affecting a\n\nperson’s emotional or volitional capacity, predisposes the person to commit a\n\nsexually violent offense, to the extent that the person becomes a menace to the\n\nhealth and safety of another person.” Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §\n\n841.002(2) (West Supp. 2013).\n\n      On appeal, Butler raises three issues. First, he contends the trial court\n\ncommitted reversible error in refusing to allow him leave of court to file a third-\n\nparty petition against the Office of Violent Sex Offender Management (OVSOM).\n\nSecond, he argues that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to allow\n\nhis attorney to perform a complete cross-examination of Dr. Gaines about her “rate\n\nof error.” In his third issue, he argues that the SVP statute is facially\n\nunconstitutional. We conclude that Butler’s issues are without merit, and we affirm\n\nthe trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                               UNDERLYING FACTS\n\n      Butler was previously convicted of three separate offenses of indecency with\n\nthree different children. The first offense for which he was convicted occurred in\n\n1982 when he was seventeen and the victim was seven. Butler testified at trial that\n\nhe saw the seven-year-old girl around his apartment complex and at the pool. He\n\nwent up to her apartment while no one else was home, and fondled her, touched\n\nher genitals with his hand, and performed oral sex on her. He received a three year\n\nsentence for his first conviction, and he was released April 3, 1984, on mandatory\n\nsupervision.\n\n      Butler committed the second sexual offense on April 25, 1984, just twenty-\n\ntwo days after his release from prison for the first offense. His second victim was\n\nan eleven-year-old girl. Butler met the girl when he was jogging at a middle\n\nschool. He had been instructed to stay away from those areas as a condition of his\n\nparole. While he was on school property, he touched the child on the breasts and\n\nbuttocks. Butler pleaded guilty to indecency with a child, and he was sentenced in\n\n1984 to ten years confinement. He was released on mandatory supervision in\n\nDecember 1989.\n\n      Once released, Butler again began “hanging around” a recreational center\n\nand young children. While at the recreational center, he touched another eleven-\n\n                                        3\n\fyear-old girl. He was indicted and pleaded guilty to indecency with a child. The\n\nindictment alleged he touched the eleven-year-old girl’s genitals and breasts with\n\nthe intent to arouse and gratify his sexual desire. This was his third conviction for\n\nindecency with a child by contact. Butler was sentenced to twenty-five years in\n\nprison for the third offense and he was scheduled to be released on mandatory\n\nsupervision for that offense in August of 2013. Butler admitted that while he was\n\nin prison he had 150 disciplinaries, and 23 of those write-ups were for sexual\n\nmisconduct.\n\n      The State’s expert, Dr. Sheri Gaines, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist\n\nwith training in forensic psychiatry, testified that she reviewed Butler’s records\n\n(including the files relating to the criminal offenses) and the evaluation by the\n\npsychologist, Dr. Woodrick. Gaines also interviewed Butler and reviewed his\n\ndeposition. She testified that Butler’s “sexual deviancy is a diagnosis of pedophilia,\n\nwhich is sexual urges, acts, or behaviors toward prepubescent children.” Gaines\n\nexplained that Butler’s pedophilia is a “chronic, lifelong condition.” She also\n\ndiagnosed Butler with “antisocial personality disorder.”\n\n      In Gaines’s professional opinion, Butler has a behavioral abnormality. In\n\nresponse to the State’s questioning, she further indicated that Butler has a\n\n“behavioral abnormality today[,]” a conclusion which she reached by reviewing\n\n                                          4\n\frecords showing Butler’s “behaviors over time” and “by looking at risk factors\n\nover time[.]” She noted that Dr. Woodrick diagnosed Butler as a psychopath.\n\nGaines concurred with that diagnosis, because Butler has a history of violence, has\n\ndifficulty controlling his anger, and has a “lifelong” problem conforming his\n\nbehavior even when he is in a structured environment.\n\n      Dr. Gaines referenced two important factors that contribute to the risk that\n\nButler will reoffend with crimes of sexual violence: his sexual deviancy and his\n\nantisocial personality disorder. Other risk factors identified by Gaines include the\n\nthree prior convictions for sexually violent offenses, other allegations regarding\n\nButler’s following of children around in the neighborhood, allegations of sexually\n\nacting out as a child even before his first conviction, assaulting one or more of his\n\nvictims in a public place, selection of unrelated and stranger victims, reoffending\n\nshortly after being released from prison on parole, and blaming his victims for his\n\nbehavior.\n\n      Dr. Gaines also recognized that Butler has exhibited certain positive factors,\n\nsuch as completion of an anger management course, finding “religion” while he\n\nwas in prison, and the continued support from his mother. However, Dr. Gaines\n\nnoted that even after Butler completed the anger management course, he\n\ncommitted “staff assaults” on prison officials, has been in administrative\n\n                                         5\n\fsegregation in prison, and has committed sexual offenses in prison even after he\n\n“found religion” and after he received some counseling. According to Dr. Gaines,\n\nButler admitted he has trouble controlling his sexual urges, and he continues to\n\nblame his victims.\n\n           REFUSAL TO ALLOW THIRD-PARTY CLAIM AGAINST OVSOM\n\n      In his first issue, Butler contends the trial court erred in refusing to allow\n\nhim leave of court to file a “third-party petition” against OVSOM. OVSOM is a\n\nstate agency that “perform[s] appropriate functions related to the sex offender civil\n\ncommitment program provided under Chapter 841, Health and Safety Code,\n\nincluding functions related to the provision of treatment and supervision to civilly\n\ncommitted sex offenders.” Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 420A.010 (West 2012).\n\n      Butler’s proposed third-party petition, which seeks a declaratory judgment\n\nand injunctive relief against OVSOM, alleges that OVSOM requires offenders\n\ncommitted under Chapter 841 to reside in “secure residential facilities,” to adhere\n\nto standards that are vague, and to be subject to a commitment statute that is\n\npunitive. At the pretrial hearing on his motion for leave to file the third-party\n\npetition, Butler argued that he needed to sue OVSOM, because “[i]n order to\n\ncontest the [c]onstitutionality of the statute we need to have the agency responsible\n\nfor administering the statute. So that makes them an indispensable party. . . .”\n\n\n                                         6\n\fButler in effect argues that the SVP statute is punitive in nature and\n\nunconstitutional, as more fully reflected in his third issue. The trial court denied the\n\nmotion and concluded that an independent suit against OVSOM would be\n\npremature.\n\n      On appeal, Butler argues that the trial court misapplied the law and erred in\n\nrefusing to allow him to file his third-party petition. He contends that his position\n\nis supported by the “findings” which the Texas Supreme Court made in In re\n\nCommitment of Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894668\"><a href=\"/opinion/894668/in-re-commitment-of-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656 (Tex. 2005). Specifically, Butler\n\npoints to the statement in Fisher that “[h]ad Fisher so requested, it is possible that\n\nthe trial court would have modified or removed some of the contract conditions of\n\nwhich he now complains.” Id. In Fisher, the Court suggested the possibility of\n\nmodification of the conditions even though OVSOM was not joined as a party. See\n\nid. The Court further noted that Fisher could not obtain any removal or\n\nmodification of the conditions or a determination of vagueness of those conditions,\n\nbecause he did not present such a request to the trial court. Id. It is clear that the\n\nSupreme Court was specifically referencing Fisher’s challenges to certain\n\nprovisions of the trial court’s post-trial commitment order and “Treatment and\n\nSupervision Contract” which was “appended” to the judgment that found Fisher to\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fbe a sexually violent predator. Id. Therefore, Butler has misconstrued the language\n\nin Fisher.\n\n      At the stage of the proceeding in which Butler was attempting to assert his\n\nthird-party claim, he had not yet been subjected to any commitment order, and the\n\nquestions surrounding the OVSOM terms of commitment were not at issue.\n\nMoreover, this Court has previously examined and rejected the argument regarding\n\nthe refusal of the trial court to require joinder of OVSOM. See In re Commitment\n\nof Dodson, No. 09-13-00222-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2218718</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (Tex. App.—\n\nBeaumont May 29, 2014, no pet.) (mem. op.) (“[I]t does not appear that OVSOM\n\nwould be a proper party to a proceeding that addressed the claims in Dodson’s\n\ncounterclaim, as the SVP statute does not contain a provision waiving OVSOM’s\n\ngovernmental immunity.”); see also Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 841.001-\n\n841.151. Likewise, the respective chapter of the Government Code pertaining to\n\nOVSOM does not contain a provision waiving sovereign immunity. See Tex. Gov’t\n\nCode Ann. §§ 420A.001-420A.011 (West 2012).\n\n      Butler claims, based on alleged comments from the trial court at certain\n\nhearings in this case and a comment made in another commitment case, that he\n\nmust add OVSOM as a party in order to challenge the constitutionality of Chapter\n\n841. The constitutionality of various sections of Chapter 841 has been repeatedly\n\n                                        8\n\fchallenged, and no section to date has been declared unconstitutional.

App.—Beaumont 2002, pet. denied). The courts have not held that OVSOM\n\nis an indispensable party in a constitutional challenge in this context. Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant\n\nButler leave to file the third-party petition against OVSOM. The trial court could\n\nhave reasonably concluded that OVSOM was not a proper party to this suit, and\n\nOVSOM’s presence in the suit--the actual purpose of which was to establish\n\nwhether or not Butler is a sexually violent predator--would not promote an orderly\n\npresentation of the commitment proceeding. Accordingly, we overrule issue one.\n\n                       LIMITATION OF CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n      In his second issue, Butler argues that the trial court erred in denying him the\n\nright to engage in further cross-examination of Dr. Gaines relating to her “rate of\n\nerror” in SVP cases. We review a trial court’s decision concerning the admission\n\nor exclusion of evidence for an abuse of discretion.

App.—Beaumont Sept. 26,\n\n2013, pet. denied) (mem. op.), we noted the potential for confusion of the jury in\n\nthe event that cross-examination questions concerning the expert’s rate of error in\n\nthe SVP context were permitted. We concluded that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in restricting questions regarding the expert’s rate of error, because the\n\nexpert was not making a prediction as to whether the defendant would commit a\n\nfuture act of sexual violence; rather the expert was assessing a present risk that was\n\nbased on the defendant’s history, his actuarial tests, and his interview. Id. at *5.\n\n      During cross-examination, Butler’s trial counsel asked Dr. Gaines the\n\nfollowing questions:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Q. Dr. Gaines, are you aware of your rate of error\n      in these cases?\n      A. I don’t understand the question.\n      Q. Are you aware of your accuracy rate in these cases?\n      A. Well, I still don’t understand the question, because you can’t\n      evaluate someone’s accuracy when they’re just giving an opinion. I\n      am not predicting the future. I am not saying: Oh, yes, Mr. Butler is\n      absolutely 100 percent going to reoffend. So I don’t think that’s even\n      a valid question.\n\n                                          11\n\f      Q. How many times have you stated that someone will commit an act\n      of sexual violence and they actually have went on to commit another\n      act of sexual violence?\n      [Prosecutor]: Objection, misleading.\n      THE COURT: Sustained.\n\nThereafter, Butler made the following offer of proof:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Q. Dr. Gaines, do you know what your rate of\n      error is?\n      A. I think I already asked (sic) that question. And--I already answered\n      that question. I think it’s an invalid question because I’m not making a\n      prediction. I’m not saying that something is going to happen. I’m\n      saying that something is likely to happen.\n      Q. Is that a “no,” that you don’t know what your rate [of] error is?\n      A. It’s not a “yes” or a “no.” I’m saying that, in my opinion, it’s an\n      invalid question because I’m not making a prediction.\n      Q. Would it surprise you that none of the people you stated was likely\n      to commit another act of sexual violence has never gone on to commit\n      another act of sexual violence?\n      A. It would not surprise me at all because that is the exact reason the\n      Legislature made this statute, to keep that from happening. So it\n      would lead me to believe that the statute is effective.\n\n            ....\n\n      [STATE]: If those questions are asked in front of the jury, I think we\n      need the opportunity . . . I think the door has been opened. We can\n      present evidence about the conditions of civil commitment and why\n      no one has reoffended and that they’re mandated to go to treatment\n      and they live in a structured setting and that sort of thing. I think . . .\n      the jury is entitled to have a full picture or we just don’t go down this\n      road at all.\n\n      THE COURT: . . . [I]t’s just misleading, asking has anybody ever . . .\n      offended, because we’re all sitting here knowing why that hasn’t\n      happened. So if we’re going to sit here and know why that hasn’t\n      been, that jury over there needs to know why it hasn’t happened;\n                                          12\n\f      because, otherwise, you’re making Dr. Gaines look like she’s, you\n      know, not doing a good job. And we don’t know whether she did a\n      good job or not because we never know if these people are going to\n      reoffend.\n\nButler requested that the testimony he obtained in the offer of proof be provided to\n\nthe jury, but the trial court denied the request. The trial court concluded that the\n\nobjected-to question was “misleading,” because the question failed to give the jury\n\nthe complete picture as to why a person who has been civilly committed may not\n\nhave reoffended.\n\n      The issue the jury was required to decide was whether Butler is a repeat\n\nsexually violent offender who presently suffers from a behavioral abnormality that\n\nmakes him likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. See Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code Ann. §§ 841.002(2), 841.003(a); § 841.062(a) (West 2010). For the\n\nreasons stated in In re Commitment of Alexander and the applicable factors stated\n\nin Rule 403 (danger of confusion of the issues or of misleading the jury), we\n\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the additional\n\n“rate of error” cross-examination questions that Butler sought to elicit from Dr.\n\nGaines. The limitation that the trial court placed upon the cross-examination was\n\nnot arbitrary or unreasonable. We overrule issue two.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                     FACIAL CONSTITUTIONALITY CHALLENGE\n\n      Butler argues in his final issue that “[s]ection 841 of the Texas Health &\n\nSafety Code is unconstitutional on its face[.]” However, Butler fails to specify\n\nwhich sections of Chapter 841 are unconstitutional and which constitutional rights\n\nhave been violated. He disagrees with the Texas Supreme Court in In re\n\nCommitment of Fisher where the Court states that the Texas SVP statute “imposes\n\nno physical restraint and therefore ‘does not resemble the punishment of\n\nimprisonment, which is the paradigmatic affirmative disability or restraint.’” In re\n\nCommitment of Fisher, 164 S.W.3d at 648 (quoting Smith v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100\n\n(2003)). Butler asserts that the Texas Supreme Court is “operating under a severe\n\nmisconception regarding civil commitment in Texas.” He argues that the Texas\n\nSVP statute is “punitive” and, therefore, the entire statute is facially\n\nunconstitutional. We have previously rejected this argument and held in Beasely,\n\n95 S.W.3d at 607-08, that Chapter 841 is not punitive in nature. See also In re\n\nCommitment of Fisher, 164 S.W.3d at 645-56. Additionally, this Court recently\n\nexamined and rejected a similar constitutional challenge to the SVP statute in In re\n\nCommitment of Dodson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2218718</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at **1-2 (noting that the Texas\n\nSupreme Court rejected the argument that the SVP statute is punitive in nature in\n\nIn re Commitment of Fisher). We note that Dodson also stated:\n\n\n                                        14\n\f             In Fisher, the Texas Supreme Court concluded that the types of\n      restrictions at issue were not necessarily evidence showing that the\n      statute was punitive in nature. If the restrictions themselves are not\n      necessarily punitive in nature, then their application to a person who is\n      committed is also not necessarily evidence that the restrictions have\n      been punitively applied. Id. at 648 (reasoning that the SVP statute’s\n      creating restraints, such as requiring persons to reside at particular\n      locations, to be fitted for satellite monitoring, and to be restricted in a\n      host of activities, did not “compel a conclusion that the statute is\n      punitive”). We are bound to follow Fisher until the Texas Supreme\n      Court instructs otherwise. See Lubbock Cnty., Tex. v. Trammel's\n      Lubbock Bail Bonds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1768247\"><a href=\"/opinion/1768247/lubbock-county-v-trammels-bail-bonds/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585 (Tex. 2002) (“It is not the\n      function of a court of appeals to abrogate or modify established\n      precedent.”).\n\nIn re Commitment of Dodson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2218718</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. We overrule Butler’s\n\nfacial constitutional challenge. He has failed to demonstrate, as he must, that the\n\nstatute always operates unconstitutionally. Wilson v. Andrews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451635\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451635/wilson-v-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 670\n\n(Tex. 1999); see also In re Commitment of Fisher, 164 S.W.3d at 654-55.
