Board of Education, supra, holding that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,\" supra, 347 U.S. at 495, 74 S.Ct. at 692.  Plaintiffs in a class action sought invalidation of the Tennessee school laws, T.C.A. Sec. 49-3701 et seq., which in specific terms required segregation of school pupils by race.  (See Appendix A) In 1956 a three-judge federal court which had been convened to pass on the constitutionality of the state statute was dissolved when the defendant Board of Education conceded the unconstitutionality of the state statute by which it had previously been governed.  Kelley v. Board of Education of City of Nashville, 139 F.Supp. 578 (M.D. Tenn.1956).  The case was then remanded to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.  The District Judge determined that the case was an appropriate class action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Record, Min. Book 19 at 683).  He ordered the defendant School Board to prepare and present a plan for desegregation of the Nashville schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before judgment was entered, the State of Tennessee in January 1957 adopted a Parental Preference Law, T.C.A. Sec. 49-3704, Pub.Acts 1957, cc. 9-13, 2 Race Rel.L.Rep. 215 (1957).  (See Appendix A) This statute provided for separate white, black, and mixed schools, with attendance to be determined by parental preference.  The District Court in September of 1957 held this statute to be unconstitutional on its face. 2 Race Rel.L.Rep. 970 (1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant School Board thereupon (and nonetheless) presented a parental preference plan for white, black, and mixed schools substantially the same as that called for by the unconstitutional state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February of 1958 the District Court held the School Board plan to be unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the same year a grade-a-year desegregation plan was submitted by defendant School Board, approved by the District Court and the Court of Appeals, with certiorari denied by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1960 a suit was filed to desegregate the Davidson County schools.  Maxwell v. County Board of Education of Davidson County, supra.  It was brought on behalf of Negro children alleged to be denied their constitutional rights to equal education in the county school system.  Again the suit was brought as a class action and recognized as such by the District Court under Rule 23 Fed.R.Civ.P.  (Record, Min. Book 24 at 114.)  The Davidson County School Board proposed a free transfer plan and it was approved by the District Court.  On appeal Maxwell's free transfer plan was invalidated by the United States Supreme Court, sub nom., Goss v. Board of Education of Knoxville, 373 U.S. 683, 83 S.Ct. 1405, 10 L.Ed.2d 632 (1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1963 the school systems of Nashville and Davidson County were then consolidated as part of a general consolidation of the City of Nashville and County of Davidson into one metropolitan government.  Petitions for further relief, including an order to desegregate the Nashville-Davidson County schools and to enjoin further school construction pending such an order, were filed in the consolidated case, with additional plaintiffs intervening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1968 the United States Supreme Court took further note of how the Brown II phrase \"deliberate speed\" was being employed to delay rather than to implement school desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of reemphasis, we again quote the unanimous opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>[A] plan that at this late date fails to provide meaningful assurance of prompt and effective disestablishment of a dual system is also intolerable. \"The time for mere 'deliberate speed' has run out,\" Griffin v.

Board of Education, 373 U.S. 683, 689 [83 S.Ct. 1405, 10 L.Ed.2d 632]. See Calhoun v. Latimer, 377 U.S. 263 [84 S.Ct. 1235, 12 L.Ed.2d 288]. The burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises realistically to work, and promises realistically to work NOW.  Green v. County School Board of Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 438-439 [88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716] (1968).  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the heels of these decisions plaintiffs sought relief consistent with them and lengthy hearings followed.  In 1970 the District Judge entered findings of fact which were subsequently reviewed and given effect by this court.  Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashville, Tennessee, 436 F.2d 856 (1970).  In its opinion this court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be well for those in authority in Nashville and Davidson County to read the able opinion [District Court opinion entered July 16, 1970] which we now revitalize by our present order.  The emphasis in the quotation which follows is that of this court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[I]t is the Court's view that in the area of school zoning, school boards will fulfill their affirmative duty to establish a unitary school system only if attendance zone lines are drawn in such way as to maximize pupil integration.  In drawing such lines, the defendant school board may properly consider in the total equation such factors as capacities and locations of schools, physical boundaries, transportation problems, and cost; however, none of these considerations can supersede the importance of the primary goal of maximizing integration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In looking to the facts of this case, the Court finds that many of the elementary and secondary school zone lines in the Nashville and Davidson County School System have not been drawn so as to minimize integration.  With the exception of zone lines drawn for new schools, the zone lines currently in existence were drawn prior to Brown v. Board of Education with the aim of maintaining segregation.  Though there has been some black population migration to formerly white areas, in large part these zone lines continue to serve quite well the segregative purpose for which they were originally established.  The truth of this statement is made manifest when one examines the racial makeup of the pupil population in areas containing several contiguous attendance zones.  In East Nashville, for example, there is a cluster of five elementary schools having contiguous attendance zones.  Of these five schools, white pupils are in the great majority in four schools, Baxter, Dalewood, Rosebank, and Bailey, while black students are in the majority in one of the schools, Inglewood.  As a reference to the zone map will indicate, Inglewood is completely surrounded by the four predominantly white schools, and the Inglewood zone is drawn to enclose most of the black population living in the five school area.  Defendants argue that they are applying the 'neighborhood' concept in the drawing of elementary school zone lines.  If such a concept is indeed being applied in this five school area, it appears to the Court that it is being applied solely to perpetuate segregation.  Defendants contend that one of the prime advantages of 'neighborhood' schools is that they allow pupils to walk to and from school.  If this is true, it is difficult to see why black pupils who live closer to Baxter or Bailey schools, for instance, are required to walk the greater distance to attend Inglewood school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The same pattern is repeated in a seven school area in south and west Nashville.  In this situation, the attendance zones for Ransom and Eakin schools are contiguous with the attendance zones for Ford, Greene, Head, Carter Lawrence, Murrel and Clemons schools.  The former two schools are almost completely white, while the latter five schools are almost totally black.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Once again it appears that the zone lines as drawn insure that white neighborhoods will have white schools and black neighborhoods will have black schools.  As the above two illustrations make clear, by maintaining the old dual school zones, defendant has encouraged continued segregation rather than significant integration in the elementary schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Turning to junior high school zones, the Court finds much the same situation as in the elementary schools.  Though the 'neighborhood' concept is not applied in secondary school zoning, junior high school zones are drawn so that each school serves a particular residential area or 'service area' as it is sometimes referred to by defendant.  These service areas cover a broader geographic area than a single neighborhood, for several elementary schools within their respective neighborhood zones feed graduating students into the junior high school within whose zone they lie.  This process is generally described in terms of a 'feeder pattern.'  Once again, a look at the existing zone lines convinces the Court that the junior high school attendance zones and the 'feeder patterns' which graduate elementary students into the junior high schools are structured so as to foster for the most part continued segregation or at best only token integration.  It is apparent that the zone lines as presently drawn are designed to provide racially identifiable 'black' schools for black residential areas and 'white' schools for white residential areas.  For example, looking at a cluster of six contiguous junior high school zones, the Court finds that Bass, West End, and Moore Junior high schools are all predominantly white schools with their attendance zones being drawn so as to correspond significantly with white residential areas.  On the other hand, Washington, Rose Park and Waverly-Belmont are all racially identifiable as black schools and their attendance zones have been drawn in a manner effectively to prevent a significant number of black pupils from attending school outside of the black residential area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Finally, looking to the high school zones, there is similar evidence of continued duality in the school system.  For example, of five contiguous high school zones, three of the schools, Cohn, Hillsboro and Central, are racially identifiable as white schools.  Their attendance zone lines form the boundary line between the predominantly white residential areas in south and west Nashville and the black residential areas to the north and east.  These black areas are served by Cameron and Pearl high schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In connection with the segregative effect of present school zoning, it is interesting to note that while portable classrooms are in limited use in predominantly Negro schools, approximately 117 portables are in use in racially identifiable white schools.  These predominantly Negro schools, on the basis of their rated maximum capacities, have approximately 5,400 vacancies, yet the white schools, in zones tailored to white residential sections, are overcrowded.  It would seem that rezoning could serve the dual purpose of alleviating this overcrowding and, at the same time, promoting the goal of integration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is the Court's conclusion that defendant's current policy of attendance zoning does not facilitate rapid conversion from a dual to a unitary school system.  As is evident from the foregoing discussion, the zone lines as they presently exist foster continued segregation in many instances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Corresponding as they do to racial residential patterns, it is difficult to envision any other result.  Historic zone lines which purposely promote segregation must be altered.  In making such alterations defendant board should take those steps 'which promise realistically to convert promptly to a system without a \"white\" school and a \"Negro\" school, but just schools.'

The District Court may, of course, require reports (including a pupil locator map) and recommendations (including those of expert witnesses and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare) and consider them in its order of implementation.

These cases present us with the problem of defining in more precise terms than heretofore the scope of the duty of school authorities and district courts in implementing Brown I and the mandate to eliminate dual systems and establish unitary systems at once.

In addition to finding certain actions of the school board to be discriminatory, the court also found that residential patterns in the city and county resulted in part from federal, state, and local government action other than school board decisions.  School board action based on these patterns, for example, by locating schools in Negro residential areas and fixing the size of the schools to accommodate the needs of immediate neighborhoods, resulted in segregated education.  These findings were subsequently accepted by the Court of Appeals.  Swann v.

Segregation was the evil struck by Brown I as contrary to the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.  That was the violation sought to be corrected by the remedial measures of Brown II.  That was the basis for the holding in Green that school authorities are \"clearly charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.\" 391 U.S., at 437-438 [88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>If school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations under these holdings, judicial authority may be invoked.

To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities; absent a finding of a constitutional violation, however, that would not be within the authority of a federal court.  As with any equity case, the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.  In default by the school authorities of their obligation to proffer acceptable remedies, a district court has broad power to fashion a remedy that will assure a unitary school system.  Swann v.

This record demonstrates that Nashville and Davidson County have long used extensive bus transportation as a normal part of their school systems.  Busing was, however, employed wholly disproportionately for the transportation of its white students as compared to its black students (30,000 white to 3,500 black).  In this regard the District Judge's opinion noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>Since the defendants have consistently transported large numbers of students to promote segregation, some adjustment must be made to reverse this unconstitutional practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court clearly found that defendants had defaulted in relation to their duty to dismantle their segregated school system prior to 1970.  The District Court also found that although defendants had repeatedly been asked and ordered to produce an adequate plan, they had failed to do so.  It noted that the School Board accepted as a policy statement \"an ideal student racial ratio of an integrated school as one which is 15% to 35% black.\"  Yet its analysis of the plan actually submitted by the School Board showed it to be utterly inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p>The Board of Education submitted a plan for pupil integration in August, 1970.  Included in this plan was a policy statement that the school board \"accepts as an ideal student racial ratio of an integrated school as one which is 15% to 35% black.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>The August, 1970 plan made 49 minor geographic zone changes, and provided for the transportation of an additional 1162 pupils.  The result of the plan was to leave the elementary schools significantly unchanged.  Six of the 38 high schools and junior high schools would remain at least 50 per cent black.  Fifty-seven per cent of the black high school and junior high school students would attend these six schools.  The racial composition of two schools would be at least 95 per cent black and four other schools would be at least 90 per cent black.  This would result in 47 per cent of the black students attending schools where the composition would be above 90 per cent black.  Eight schools, accommodating 20 per cent of the black students, would operate with 15-35 per cent black students.  Fifteen schools would operate with 95 per cent or above white students.

It is described in detail in his Memorandum Opinion, dated June 28, 1971, and in his Judgment, dated July 15, 1971, both of which are by reference hereby incorporated as a part of this opinion.  For our present purpose it suffices for us to note that in all respects which have come to our attention, the HEW plan approved by the District Judge represents a somewhat less stringent approach to desegregation than the plan approved by the United States Supreme Court in Swann, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Major portions of the Court's comprehensive Opinion and Judgment, such as those dealing with faculty desegregation, school construction and maintenance, and transfer policy, etc., are not discussed herein because no appellate issues have been presented as to those features.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I The Rule 23 Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the Rule 23 issue, earnestly if belatedly sought to be raised by appellants, we affirm the Memorandum Order of the District Judge, dated July 21, 1971, for the reasons set forth therein, and print same for ready reference as Appendix B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, we note that this issue was clearly waived by failure of appellants to raise it prior to trial and final adjudication of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that such a class action as this dealing with continuing constitutional violations does not become moot because of years of delay (much of it attributable to appellants) which occasioned the graduation of the named, original student plaintiffs from the school system before final decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II The Ratio and Residual Effect Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>(Plaintiffs' stated Issues 2, 3 &amp; 4)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a school system has been deliberately constructed on a segregated basis by state action, a duty inheres in the School Board to do more than to establish rules fair on their face which simply serve to perpetuate the effects of such segregation.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 26, 28, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case supports the District Judge's findings that racial discrimination in school construction, assignment of temporary buildings, assignment of teachers, and assignment of students continued until the close of the record--if not beyond.  The record also discloses a background of racial discrimination by means of state law which motivated much of the school segregation.  (See Appendix A)The fact that population shifts in the metropolitan school district have helped to some degree to change the racial composition of some schools during the course of litigation does not eliminate the duty of the school board to present a plan for a unitary school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor, of course, does it alter the duty of the District Court on default of the school board to require production of such a plan and order it into effect.

The Supreme Court specifically approved his doing so.  See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, 402 U.S. at 16, 23-24, 91 S.Ct. at 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554.  The District Judge, in this case clearly read and followed the Swann guideline.  As to this issue, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An earlier finding of \"good faith\" does nothing to excuse the defaults and failures shown by this record. \"The measure of any desegregation plan is its effectiveness.\"  Davis v.

County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 439, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III Practical Problems</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is an appellate issue of substance in this appeal, it is to be found in the practical problems which appellants claim have developed since the entry of the District Judge's order.  Appellant summarizes these issues thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>A plan which exposes the children in the school system to undue danger to health and accident, interferes with their education by requiring excessive periods of time on buses, causes them to leave home before daylight or to return home after dark, exposes them to the dangers of travel in old and inadequately maintained equipment and causes elementary school children, both black and white, to suffer hardships to which young children should not be exposed can hardly be termed feasible, workable, effective and realistic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantial as these problems appear to be on the surface, there are two reasons why no relief can be granted in this forum.  The first is that no motion for relief pertaining to these facts has ever been filed by appellant in the District Court.  These statements at this point are allegations and they are controverted by the appellee.  This, of course, is an appellate court--not a trial court.  As appellants well know, the arena for fact-finding in the federal courts is the United States District Court.  Until these claims have been presented in a trial court, with an opportunity for sworn testimony to be taken and controverted issues and facts decided by the processes of adversary hearing, this court has no jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second reason as to why appellants are entitled to no relief on this issue probably serves to explain the first.  The entire \"record\" upon which appellant bases his plea for relief as to practical problems is a \"Report to the Court\" of Dr. Brooks, Director of Schools of the Metropolitan County Board of Education.  This report is dated October 18, 1971, just over a month after the opening of school.  While we are advised that it was sent to the District Judge, as we have noted, no motion of any kind seeking any District Court action was ever filed concerning it.  Even more important, the statement on its face suggests that local authorities in Nashville and Davidson County have not made good faith efforts to comply with the order of the District Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Brooks' affidavit does present this exculpatory explanation which serves to point in the direction of other authorities as those responsible for the inconveniences and hazards of which Dr. Brooks' statement speaks.  The statement says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>The School Board is fiscally dependent in that its budgets must be approved by the Metropolitan City Council.  In approving the budget of the School Board on June 30, 1971, Council members demanded assurance that no funds included in the budget would be used to purchase buses for the purpose of transporting students to establish a racial balance.  The 1971-72 budget did provide for the purchase of 18 large buses to replace obsolete equipment to provide transportation for students to the new comprehensive McGavock High School.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear, however, that neither the Metropolitan City Council or, for that matter, the Legislature of Tennessee can forbid the implementation of a court mandate based upon the United States Constitution.  In a companion case to Swann, supra, Chief Justice Burger, writing again for a unanimous court held that an anti-busing law which flatly forbids assignment of any student on account of race or for the purpose of creating a racial balance or ratio in the schools and which prohibits busing for such purposes was invalid as preventing implementation of desegregation plans required by the Fourteenth Amendment.  North Carolina State Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 45-46, 91 S.Ct. 1284, 28 L.Ed.2d 586 (1971).  See also Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5, 19 (1958).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Brooks' statement also furnishes the bus schedule of the Metropolitan County Board of Education by yearly models.  It shows that the Board has an average of 18.9 buses for each of the last 10 model years.  The 18 buses purchased in 1971 were described by Dr. Brooks as \"to replace obsolete equipment.\"  It appears from the Metropolitan Board's own statements that the Board and the local authorities in Nashville did not purchase one piece of transportation equipment for the purpose of converting the Metropolitan County Board of Education school system from a dual school system segregated by race into a unitary one, as called for by the District Judge's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At court hearing we had been puzzled as to why counsel for the Board had failed to go back to the District Court to report on the grievous circumstances which he so strongly alleged before us.  Like most decrees in equity, an injunctive decree in a school desegregation case is always subject to modification on the basis of changed circumstances.  Sloan v. Tenth School District of Wilson County, 433 F.2d 587, 589-590 (6th Cir. 1970).  Further acquaintance with the record, which, of course, the District Judge would have known in detail, leaves us in no further quandry as to the reasons for counsel's reluctance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV Plaintiffs-Appellants' Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of this record convinces us that the District Judge's choice of the HEW plan as opposed to plaintiffs' plan was well within his judicial discretion.  It may not be ideal, but to us it seems clearly to be a plan for ending a dual school system based on race and substituting therefor a unitary one.  It promises to work and to work now.  Green v. County School Board of Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>V. Plaintiffs-Cross-Appellants' Discrimination Claim</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-Cross-appellants claim that the grade school plan discriminates against Negro students in the lowest elementary grades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The feature complained of in this issue is the transportation of black students in grades 1-4 to outlying schools, paralleled by the cross-transportation of white students in grades 5-6.  In this regard the HEW plan appears to follow the pattern of the school plan approved in Swann.  Swann v. Board of Education, supra, 402 U.S. at 10, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554.  The Supreme Court made no reference to this feature, and neither in Swann nor in this case does the record seem to provide adequate rationale for it.  We do not believe, however, that we can appropriately hold that the District Judge abused his discretion in approving the HEW plan which (like the plan in Swann) incorporated this feature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be that this is a temporary expedient or it may be that there are practical reasons to justify it for longer duration.  In any event, any adverse effects of this aspect of the plan can, of course, likewise be brought to the District Judge's attention when the case is back before him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Intervention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twenty-four hours before oral arguments in this appeal, the United States Department of Justice filed a motion to intervene as amicus curiae.  In spite of the extraordinary delay in filing the motion, we granted leave to intervene and invited the representative of the Justice Department who appeared to address the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On reading the motion, hearing oral argument, and questioning counsel, we determined that the representative of the Justice Department had not had the opportunity to read the District Court record in this case and was not aware in advance of hearing that the claimed practical problems had never been presented to or adjudicated by the District Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>One America</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This nation has been told by a Presidential Commission that our country is rapidly becoming divided into two societies--one black and one white.

What the Constitution and the Supreme Court say about the principal issue of this case is that no one may forbid a school board (or a federal court) from employing any of the tools of modern life in carrying out a constitutional mandate.  Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 37-38, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court order in this case specifically retained jurisdiction.  Thus, upon our affirmance, the door of the District Court is clearly open (as it has been!) to the parties to present any unanticipated problems (not resulting from failure to comply with its order) which may have arisen or may arise in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now affirm the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgments of the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge's order noted that no stay would issue and we likewise note that any stay of this order must be sought from the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX A</p>\n    <p>CHAPTER 37</p>\n    <p>SEGREGATION OF RACES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>SECTION.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p>49-3701-49-3704.

Miller carefully adhered to Rule 23 as it existed at the time of the filing of these two cases.  The Court of Appeals did not question his determination, but affirmed the actions which he took in the matter.  In addition, in the latest mandate to the District Court received from the Court of Appeals in February, 1971, this Court was instructed to implement the July 16, 1970 opinion of the Honorable William E. Miller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court does not feel once a class action has been adjudicated and the action of the trial court has been reviewed by the Court of Appeals, that it is necessary or proper to continue to redetermine the standing of the plaintiffs to represent a class.  The United States Supreme Court in its order implementing the amendment to Rule 23 states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p>\". . . the foregoing amendments and additions to the Rules of Civil Procedure shall take effect on July 1, 1966, and shall govern all proceedings in actions then pending except to the extent that in the opinion of the Court their application in a particular action then pending would not be feasible or would work injustice in which event the former procedure applies.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See also Escott v.

Frankly, this Court feels that it is not feasible or practical to have continuous adjudication of such items.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the above, the Court is not required to determine (1) whether this question should have been raised prior to the adjudication of the cause, and (2) what, if any, effect the alleged failure to comply with Rule 23 would have on the right of the individual plaintiff children who reside throughout Davidson County, Tennessee, to assert their constitutional privilege to attend an integrated school in a unitary school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motions are hereby denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>L.

Nevertheless, I wish to add a few observations concerning our reasons for rejecting plaintiffs' cross-appeal and affirming for the present, the District Court's selection of the HEW plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court, in deciding to reject plaintiffs' plan, recognized that under Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); Davis v. School Commissioners of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971); and Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968), its duty was to select the plan that appeared to be the most effective in eradicating the effects of past segregation, unless it would be impractical to adopt such a plan.  The court found that plaintiffs' plan was \"impractical and not feasible\" because of the costs and transportation problems that would result from the inclusion of certain outcounty schools in the plan.  The court also relied upon the fact that plaintiffs' plan left to the school board the specifics of pupil assignment, grade organization, school structuring, and school district zoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues and I agree that there is no need at this juncture to hold that the District Court abused its discretion in thus preferring the HEW plan over that of plaintiffs.  The HEW plan promises to accomplish a significant degree of integration, and it is a plan that promises realistically to work and to work now.  Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, supra, 391 U.S. at 439, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716.  Although plaintiffs' plan might have more effectively desegregated the district's schools, its inclusion of outlying schools and its lack of specificity rendered it, in the court's opinion, impractical and unfeasible. Since the District Court has retained jurisdiction in order to supervise the implementation and effectiveness of the HEW plan, plaintiffs have the option of revising their plan to eliminate the defects noted by the court and requesting the court to make specific changes in the plan to promote, in a practical way, more effective integration.  If the court should then find that plaintiffs' plan is \"feasible and pedagogically sound,\" Robinson v. Shelby County Board of Education, 442 F.2d 255, 258 (6th Cir.), on remand 330 F.Supp. 837 (W.D.Tenn.1971), appeal pending, No. 71-1966 (6th Cir.), it would be required to adopt that plan.  See Harrington v. Colquitt County Board of Education, 460 F.2d 193 (5th Cir. 1972); Monroe v. Board of Commissioners of City of Jackson, Tennessee, 453 F.2d 259, 262 (6th Cir. 1972), cert. filed, 406 U.S. 945, 92 S.Ct. 2045, 32 L.Ed.2d 333 (1972) (No. 71-1249); Robinson v. Shelby County Board of Education, supra; Davis v. School District of City of Pontiac, Inc., 443 F.2d 573, 576-577 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 913, 92 S. Ct. 233, 30 L.Ed.2d 186 (1971).  In the special circumstances of this case, therefore, there is no need to remand and thereby possibly jeopardize implementation of the first desegregation plan ordered into effect in this school district that promises, after 17 years of litigation, realistically to work now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiffs' contention that the District Court abused its discretion in adopting a plan that places the greater burden of desegregation on black children and their parents, I observe initially that, although the plan approved by the Supreme Court in Swann appears to have contained a provision that in some respects resembles one of the features of the HEW plan attacked by plaintiffs herein--the pairing and clustering feature that requires all children in grades one through four to attend suburban schools while all children in grades five and six attend the inner-city schools--Swann cannot be read as uncritically approving any plan employing a similar technique if it has an unreasonably disparate racial impact.  The issue apparently was not raised in the Supreme Court and the Court did not discuss it.  Moreover, the District Court in Swann, in approving the adoption of this feature of the school board's plan, did so \"only (1) with great reluctance, (2) as a one-year, temporary arrangement, and (3) with the distinct reservation that 'one-way bussing' plans for the years after 1969-70 will not be acceptable.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 306 F.Supp. 1291, 1298 (W.D.N.C.1969).  And, following the Supreme Court's decision in Swann, the District Court rejected a revised plan proposed by the school board because, among other reasons, the plan continued to place a disproportionate burden on black children and their parents without showing any educational justification therefor.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 328 F.Supp. 1346, 1352-1353 (W.D.N.C.1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since I agree, however, that remand is not required at this time, and since I wish to make it clear what the majority opinion is not holding with respect to this issue, I add the following comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without a compelling justification, adoption of a plan that places a greater burden of accomplishing integration on black students and their parents is impermissible, whether this be phrased in terms of an equal protection violation because the plan was the school board's product, see, e. g., Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 448 F.2d 746, 753-754 (5th Cir. 1971); Carr v. Montgomery County Board of Education, 429 F.2d 382, 385 (5th Cir. 1970); Brice v. Landis, 314 F.Supp. 974, 978-979 (N.D.Cal. 1969), or in terms of an abuse of the court's discretion in fashioning an equitable remedy to rectify the effects of past injustice.  Although adoption of such a plan might be justified on the basis of the nature of facilities involved, or on practical, administrative considerations, or on the need to adopt a temporary expedient to assure at least immediate substantial progress toward the creation of a unitary school system (see Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, 306 F.Supp. at 1298), we cannot determine the reason for the District Court's decision because the court did not discuss this issue in its memorandum opinion.  Ordinarily, in such a case, we would remand for findings and conclusions by the District Court.  See Gordon v. Jefferson Davis Parish School Board, 446 F.2d 266 (5th Cir. 1971) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the same considerations that argue against remand on the issue of the court's adoption of a less effective plan are persuasive here as well.  The integration plan adopted by the court has been in operation during the 1971-72 school year, and the court has retained jurisdiction of this case to oversee and, if necessary, to modify the plan's implementation.  The defendant school board has indicated in this court that it intends to seek modification on the basis of asserted practical problems that have become apparent since the plan was put into effect.  Plaintiffs have indicated dissatisfaction with the adoption of a plan less effective than that proposed by them, and we have indicated that they may seek further relief in the District Court.  In these circumstances, I agree that we should not now disturb the District Court's approval of the HEW plan and possibly encourage the kind of delay and inaction that has caused this case to pend for 17 years.  Plaintiffs may seek modification of the court's order on the ground that the plan places a disproportionate burden on black children and their parents, and this issue can be litigated and determined before the beginning of the 1972-73 school year.  In this way, the disproportionate burden asserted by plaintiffs will exist at most for only a short period of time and will amount to no more than a transitory phase (assuming the absence of sufficient justification for maintaining it permanently) in the over-all creation of a unitary school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is to be emphasized, nevertheless, that our refusal to take affirmative action on this issue at this time results only from the peculiar timing, posture, and history of this case.  Our opinion should not be construed in any way as a qualification of the principle that a district court has an obligation to endeavor to distribute the burden of integration equitably on all races and that any deviation from this norm, without a compelling justification, is impermissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I observe that the majority opinion does not discuss plaintiffs-appellees' contention that they should be awarded double costs and attorneys' fees because the school board's appeal is frivolous within the meaning of Fed.R. App.P. 38.  Since the class action issue obviously has no merit, and since the only issue raised by the Board that might have merit has never been presented to the District Court, I would award the requested double costs and attorneys' fees.  See Coppedge v. Franklin County Board of Education, 404 F.2d 1177, 1179-1180 (4th Cir. 1968); cf. Monroe v. Board of Commissioners of City of Jackson, Tennessee, supra, 453 F.2d at 262-263.  The long history of this litigation would, in my opinion, make such an award particularly appropriate.  Cf. Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School District, 449 F.2d 493, 499 (8th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 936, 92 S.Ct. 954, 30 L.Ed.2d 812.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> See Map No. 2 in Appendix and note the following figures<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-1\" id=\"fn-s-1_ref\">*</a> on the enrollment of these schools:</p>\n        <pre>                    W     B   % B\n                 ----  ----  ----\nFord Greene         0   887   100\nHead                0   791   100\nCarter Lawrence     0   516   100\nMurrel              0   328   100\nClemons            51   519    90\nRansom            355     2     1\nEakin             487     5     1</pre>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s--1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s--1_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Based on plaintiff's exhibit No. 3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> See Map No. 3 in Appendix and note the following figures:<sup>*</sup></p>\n        <pre>                    W      B   % B\n                 ----  -----  ----\nBass              777     12     2\nWest End          578     40     6\nMoore             999     85     8\nWashington          0  1,347   100\nRose Park          11    527    98\nWaverly-Belmont    26    260    91</pre>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Based on plaintiff's exhibit No. 3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> See Map No. 4 in Appendix and note the following figures:</p>\n        <pre>               W      B   % B\n           -----  -----  ----\nCohn         960     45     4\nHillsboro  1,223     15     1\nCentral      899    203    18\nPearl          1  1,308   100\nCameron        0  1,212   100</pre>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Of the 139 regular schools in the system in 1969-70, 88 had less than 10% black enrollment, 22 had 10% to 40% black enrolling (with the total enrollment of these latter 22 schools constituting only 16% of the entire metropolitan school enrollment), and finally29 schools had more than 40% black enrollment.

The emphasis in the quotation which follows is that of this court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[I]t is the Court's view that in the area of school zoning, school boards will fulfill their affirmative duty to establish a unitary school system only if attendance zone lines are drawn in such way as to maximize pupil integration.  In drawing such lines, the defendant school board may properly consider in the total equation such factors as capacities and locations of schools, physical boundaries, transportation problems, and cost; however, none of these considerations can supersede the importance of the primary goal of maximizing integration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In looking to the facts of this case, the Court finds that many of the elementary and secondary school zone lines in the Nashville and Davidson County School System have not been drawn so as to minimize integration.  With the exception of zone lines drawn for new schools, the zone lines currently in existence were drawn prior to Brown v. Board of Education with the aim of maintaining segregation.  Though there has been some black population migration to formerly white areas, in large part these zone lines continue to serve quite well the segregative purpose for which they were originally established.  The truth of this statement is made manifest when one examines the racial makeup of the pupil population in areas containing several contiguous attendance zones.  In East Nashville, for example, there is a cluster of five elementary schools having contiguous attendance zones.  Of these five schools, white pupils are in the great majority in four schools, Baxter, Dalewood, Rosebank, and Bailey, while black students are in the majority in one of the schools, Inglewood.  As a reference to the zone map will indicate, Inglewood is completely surrounded by the four predominantly white schools, and the Inglewood zone is drawn to enclose most of the black population living in the five school area.  Defendants argue that they are applying the 'neighborhood' concept in the drawing of elementary school zone lines.  If such a concept is indeed being applied in this five school area, it appears to the Court that it is being applied solely to perpetuate segregation.  Defendants contend that one of the prime advantages of 'neighborhood' schools is that they allow pupils to walk to and from school.  If this is true, it is difficult to see why black pupils who live closer to Baxter or Bailey schools, for instance, are required to walk the greater distance to attend Inglewood school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The same pattern is repeated in a seven school area in south and west Nashville.  In this situation, the attendance zones for Ransom and Eakin schools are contiguous with the attendance zones for Ford, Greene, Head, Carter Lawrence, Murrel and Clemons schools.  The former two schools are almost completely white, while the latter five schools are almost totally black.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Once again it appears that the zone lines as drawn insure that white neighborhoods will have white schools and black neighborhoods will have black schools.  As the above two illustrations make clear, by maintaining the old dual school zones, defendant has encouraged continued segregation rather than significant integration in the elementary schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Turning to junior high school zones, the Court finds much the same situation as in the elementary schools.  Though the 'neighborhood' concept is not applied in secondary school zoning, junior high school zones are drawn so that each school serves a particular residential area or 'service area' as it is sometimes referred to by defendant.  These service areas cover a broader geographic area than a single neighborhood, for several elementary schools within their respective neighborhood zones feed graduating students into the junior high school within whose zone they lie.  This process is generally described in terms of a 'feeder pattern.'  Once again, a look at the existing zone lines convinces the Court that the junior high school attendance zones and the 'feeder patterns' which graduate elementary students into the junior high schools are structured so as to foster for the most part continued segregation or at best only token integration.  It is apparent that the zone lines as presently drawn are designed to provide racially identifiable 'black' schools for black residential areas and 'white' schools for white residential areas.  For example, looking at a cluster of six contiguous junior high school zones, the Court finds that Bass, West End, and Moore Junior high schools are all predominantly white schools with their attendance zones being drawn so as to correspond significantly with white residential areas.  On the other hand, Washington, Rose Park and Waverly-Belmont are all racially identifiable as black schools and their attendance zones have been drawn in a manner effectively to prevent a significant number of black pupils from attending school outside of the black residential area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Finally, looking to the high school zones, there is similar evidence of continued duality in the school system.  For example, of five contiguous high school zones, three of the schools, Cohn, Hillsboro and Central, are racially identifiable as white schools.  Their attendance zone lines form the boundary line between the predominantly white residential areas in south and west Nashville and the black residential areas to the north and east.  These black areas are served by Cameron and Pearl high schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In connection with the segregative effect of present school zoning, it is interesting to note that while portable classrooms are in limited use in predominantly Negro schools, approximately 117 portables are in use in racially identifiable white schools.  These predominantly Negro schools, on the basis of their rated maximum capacities, have approximately 5,400 vacancies, yet the white schools, in zones tailored to white residential sections, are overcrowded.  It would seem that rezoning could serve the dual purpose of alleviating this overcrowding and, at the same time, promoting the goal of integration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is the Court's conclusion that defendant's current policy of attendance zoning does not facilitate rapid conversion from a dual to a unitary school system.  As is evident from the foregoing discussion, the zone lines as they presently exist foster continued segregation in many instances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Corresponding as they do to racial residential patterns, it is difficult to envision any other result.  Historic zone lines which purposely promote segregation must be altered.  In making such alterations defendant board should take those steps 'which promise realistically to convert promptly to a system without a \"white\" school and a \"Negro\" school, but just schools.'

It noted that the School Board accepted as a policy statement \"an ideal student racial ratio of an integrated school as one which is 15% to 35% black.\"  Yet its analysis of the plan actually submitted by the School Board showed it to be utterly inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p>The Board of Education submitted a plan for pupil integration in August, 1970.

The result of the plan was to leave the elementary schools significantly unchanged.  Six of the 38 high schools and junior high schools would remain at least 50 per cent black.  Fifty-seven per cent of the black high school and junior high school students would attend these six schools.  The racial composition of two schools would be at least 95 per cent black and four other schools would be at least 90 per cent black.  This would result in 47 per cent of the black students attending schools where the composition would be above 90 per cent black.  Eight schools, accommodating 20 per cent of the black students, would operate with 15-35 per cent black students.  Fifteen schools would operate with 95 per cent or above white students.

The record also discloses a background of racial discrimination by means of state law which motivated much of the school segregation.  (See Appendix A)The fact that population shifts in the metropolitan school district have helped to some degree to change the racial composition of some schools during the course of litigation does not eliminate the duty of the school board to present a plan for a unitary school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor, of course, does it alter the duty of the District Court on default of the school board to require production of such a plan and order it into effect.  Chief Justice Burger put the matter thus in the Davis case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>Having once found a violation, the district judge or school authorities should make every effort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the practicalities of the situation.  Davis v. School Commissioners of Mobile County, supra, 402 U.S. at 37, 91 S.Ct. at 1292.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the primary thing that the Swann case decided was that in devising plans to terminate such residual effects, it is appropriate for the school system and the District Judge to take note of the proportion of white and black students within the area<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and to seek as practical a plan as may be for ending white schools and black schools and substituting therefor schools which are representative of the area in which the students live.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted that the District Judge in Swann employed a flexible 71% white to 29% black population ratio as a guide in seeking a practical plan.  The Supreme Court specifically approved his doing so.  See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, 402 U.S. at 16, 23-24, 91 S.Ct. at 1267, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Appellant summarizes these issues thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>A plan which exposes the children in the school system to undue danger to health and accident, interferes with their education by requiring excessive periods of time on buses, causes them to leave home before daylight or to return home after dark, exposes them to the dangers of travel in old and inadequately maintained equipment and causes elementary school children, both black and white, to suffer hardships to which young children should not be exposed can hardly be termed feasible, workable, effective and realistic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantial as these problems appear to be on the surface, there are two reasons why no relief can be granted in this forum.  The first is that no motion for relief pertaining to these facts has ever been filed by appellant in the District Court.  These statements at this point are allegations and they are controverted by the appellee.  This, of course, is an appellate court--not a trial court.  As appellants well know, the arena for fact-finding in the federal courts is the United States District Court.  Until these claims have been presented in a trial court, with an opportunity for sworn testimony to be taken and controverted issues and facts decided by the processes of adversary hearing, this court has no jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second reason as to why appellants are entitled to no relief on this issue probably serves to explain the first.  The entire \"record\" upon which appellant bases his plea for relief as to practical problems is a \"Report to the Court\" of Dr. Brooks, Director of Schools of the Metropolitan County Board of Education.  This report is dated October 18, 1971, just over a month after the opening of school.  While we are advised that it was sent to the District Judge, as we have noted, no motion of any kind seeking any District Court action was ever filed concerning it.  Even more important, the statement on its face suggests that local authorities in Nashville and Davidson County have not made good faith efforts to comply with the order of the District Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Brooks' affidavit does present this exculpatory explanation which serves to point in the direction of other authorities as those responsible for the inconveniences and hazards of which Dr. Brooks' statement speaks.  The statement says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>The School Board is fiscally dependent in that its budgets must be approved by the Metropolitan City Council.  In approving the budget of the School Board on June 30, 1971, Council members demanded assurance that no funds included in the budget would be used to purchase buses for the purpose of transporting students to establish a racial balance.  The 1971-72 budget did provide for the purchase of 18 large buses to replace obsolete equipment to provide transportation for students to the new comprehensive McGavock High School.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear, however, that neither the Metropolitan City Council or, for that matter, the Legislature of Tennessee can forbid the implementation of a court mandate based upon the United States Constitution.  In a companion case to Swann, supra, Chief Justice Burger, writing again for a unanimous court held that an anti-busing law which flatly forbids assignment of any student on account of race or for the purpose of creating a racial balance or ratio in the schools and which prohibits busing for such purposes was invalid as preventing implementation of desegregation plans required by the Fourteenth Amendment.

It shows that the Board has an average of 18.9 buses for each of the last 10 model years.  The 18 buses purchased in 1971 were described by Dr. Brooks as \"to replace obsolete equipment.\"  It appears from the Metropolitan Board's own statements that the Board and the local authorities in Nashville did not purchase one piece of transportation equipment for the purpose of converting the Metropolitan County Board of Education school system from a dual school system segregated by race into a unitary one, as called for by the District Judge's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At court hearing we had been puzzled as to why counsel for the Board had failed to go back to the District Court to report on the grievous circumstances which he so strongly alleged before us.  Like most decrees in equity, an injunctive decree in a school desegregation case is always subject to modification on the basis of changed circumstances.  Sloan v.

Further acquaintance with the record, which, of course, the District Judge would have known in detail, leaves us in no further quandry as to the reasons for counsel's reluctance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV Plaintiffs-Appellants' Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of this record convinces us that the District Judge's choice of the HEW plan as opposed to plaintiffs' plan was well within his judicial discretion.  It may not be ideal, but to us it seems clearly to be a plan for ending a dual school system based on race and substituting therefor a unitary one.  It promises to work and to work now.  Green v.

In this regard the HEW plan appears to follow the pattern of the school plan approved in Swann.  Swann v. Board of Education, supra, 402 U.S. at 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>.  The Supreme Court made no reference to this feature, and neither in Swann nor in this case does the record seem to provide adequate rationale for it.  We do not believe, however, that we can appropriately hold that the District Judge abused his discretion in approving the HEW plan which (like the plan in Swann) incorporated this feature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be that this is a temporary expedient or it may be that there are practical reasons to justify it for longer duration.  In any event, any adverse effects of this aspect of the plan can, of course, likewise be brought to the District Judge's attention when the case is back before him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Intervention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twenty-four hours before oral arguments in this appeal, the United States Department of Justice filed a motion to intervene as amicus curiae.  In spite of the extraordinary delay in filing the motion, we granted leave to intervene and invited the representative of the Justice Department who appeared to address the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On reading the motion, hearing oral argument, and questioning counsel, we determined that the representative of the Justice Department had not had the opportunity to read the District Court record in this case and was not aware in advance of hearing that the claimed practical problems had never been presented to or adjudicated by the District Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>One America</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This nation has been told by a Presidential Commission that our country is rapidly becoming divided into two societies--one black and one white.

Prior to the amendment, class actions were referred to as \"spurious\" or \"true\" class actions.  Prior to the amendment, the requirements for the maintenance and determination of the existence of a proper class action were less stringent than those requirements as set forth in Rule 23, as amended.

All orders, judgments, and other proceedings in the first case and the second case were made effective as to the substituted defendant.

The Court of Appeals did not question his determination, but affirmed the actions which he took in the matter.  In addition, in the latest mandate to the District Court received from the Court of Appeals in February, 1971, this Court was instructed to implement the July 16, 1970 opinion of the Honorable William E.

County School Board of New Kent County, supra, 391 U.S. at 439, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although plaintiffs' plan might have more effectively desegregated the district's schools, its inclusion of outlying schools and its lack of specificity rendered it, in the court's opinion, impractical and unfeasible. Since the District Court has retained jurisdiction in order to supervise the implementation and effectiveness of the HEW plan, plaintiffs have the option of revising their plan to eliminate the defects noted by the court and requesting the court to make specific changes in the plan to promote, in a practical way, more effective integration.

In the special circumstances of this case, therefore, there is no need to remand and thereby possibly jeopardize implementation of the first desegregation plan ordered into effect in this school district that promises, after 17 years of litigation, realistically to work now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to plaintiffs' contention that the District Court abused its discretion in adopting a plan that places the greater burden of desegregation on black children and their parents, I observe initially that, although the plan approved by the Supreme Court in Swann appears to have contained a provision that in some respects resembles one of the features of the HEW plan attacked by plaintiffs herein--the pairing and clustering feature that requires all children in grades one through four to attend suburban schools while all children in grades five and six attend the inner-city schools--Swann cannot be read as uncritically approving any plan employing a similar technique if it has an unreasonably disparate racial impact.  The issue apparently was not raised in the Supreme Court and the Court did not discuss it.  Moreover, the District Court in Swann, in approving the adoption of this feature of the school board's plan, did so \"only (1) with great reluctance, (2) as a one-year, temporary arrangement, and (3) with the distinct reservation that 'one-way bussing' plans for the years after 1969-70 will not be acceptable.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1794147\"><a href=\"/opinion/1794147/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1291</span></a></span>, 1298 (W.D.N.C.1969).  And, following the Supreme Court's decision in Swann, the District Court rejected a revised plan proposed by the school board because, among other reasons, the plan continued to place a disproportionate burden on black children and their parents without showing any educational justification therefor.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1428243\"><a href=\"/opinion/1428243/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Macon County Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"299130\"><a href=\"/opinion/299130/anthony-t-lee-united-states-of-america-plaintiff-intervenor-appellants/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span>, 753-754 (5th Cir. 1971); Carr v. Montgomery County Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"291234\"><a href=\"/opinion/291234/arlam-carr-v-montgomery-county-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 385 (5th Cir. 1970); Brice v. Landis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1472559\"><a href=\"/opinion/1472559/brice-v-landis/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>, 978-979 (N.D.Cal. 1969), or in terms of an abuse of the court's discretion in fashioning an equitable remedy to rectify the effects of past injustice.  Although adoption of such a plan might be justified on the basis of the nature of facilities involved, or on practical, administrative considerations, or on the need to adopt a temporary expedient to assure at least immediate substantial progress toward the creation of a unitary school system (see Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, supra, 306 F.Supp. at 1298), we cannot determine the reason for the District Court's decision because the court did not discuss this issue in its memorandum opinion.  Ordinarily, in such a case, we would remand for findings and conclusions by the District Court.  See Gordon v. Jefferson Davis Parish School Board, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"298160\"><a href=\"/opinion/298160/marcus-gordon-v-jefferson-davis-parish-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1971) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the same considerations that argue against remand on the issue of the court's adoption of a less effective plan are persuasive here as well.  The integration plan adopted by the court has been in operation during the 1971-72 school year, and the court has retained jurisdiction of this case to oversee and, if necessary, to modify the plan's implementation.  The defendant school board has indicated in this court that it intends to seek modification on the basis of asserted practical problems that have become apparent since the plan was put into effect.  Plaintiffs have indicated dissatisfaction with the adoption of a plan less effective than that proposed by them, and we have indicated that they may seek further relief in the District Court.  In these circumstances, I agree that we should not now disturb the District Court's approval of the HEW plan and possibly encourage the kind of delay and inaction that has caused this case to pend for 17 years.  Plaintiffs may seek modification of the court's order on the ground that the plan places a disproportionate burden on black children and their parents, and this issue can be litigated and determined before the beginning of the 1972-73 school year.  In this way, the disproportionate burden asserted by plaintiffs will exist at most for only a short period of time and will amount to no more than a transitory phase (assuming the absence of sufficient justification for maintaining it permanently) in the over-all creation of a unitary school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is to be emphasized, nevertheless, that our refusal to take affirmative action on this issue at this time results only from the peculiar timing, posture, and history of this case.  Our opinion should not be construed in any way as a qualification of the principle that a district court has an obligation to endeavor to distribute the burden of integration equitably on all races and that any deviation from this norm, without a compelling justification, is impermissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I observe that the majority opinion does not discuss plaintiffs-appellees' contention that they should be awarded double costs and attorneys' fees because the school board's appeal is frivolous within the meaning of Fed.R. App.P. 38.  Since the class action issue obviously has no merit, and since the only issue raised by the Board that might have merit has never been presented to the District Court, I would award the requested double costs and attorneys' fees.  See Coppedge v. Franklin County Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"282790\"><a href=\"/opinion/282790/harold-douglas-coppedge-united-states-of-america-by-ramsey-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span>, 1179-1180 (4th Cir. 1968); cf. Monroe v. Board of Commissioners of City of Jackson, Tennessee, supra, 453 F.2d at 262-263.  The long history of this litigation would, in my opinion, make such an award particularly appropriate.
