Plaintiff challenged the\n\nassessment, claiming its property was exempt from taxation as it\n\nwas used exclusively for religious purposes.    The Sangamon County\n\nboard of review agreed with plaintiff and determined the property\n\nshould be exempt.   After review of the board's decision, defen-\n\ndants, the Illinois Department of Revenue (Department) and its\n\nDirector, Brian A. Hamer, denied the exemption.    Plaintiff\n\nrequested a formal hearing.    After a hearing before an adminis-\n\ntrative law judge (ALJ), the ALJ recommended the exemption be\n\fdenied, and her determination was accepted by the Department and\n\nits Director.    On administrative review, the circuit court\n\nreversed, finding the property was exempt.\n\n            The Department and its Director appeal, arguing the\n\nagency determination the property was not exempt should be upheld\n\nand the circuit court's judgment reversed.    Specifically, these\n\ndefendants argue (1) plaintiff submitted insufficient evidence\n\nits land qualified for exemption and (2) the evidence actually\n\nsubmitted shows plaintiff's land is not entitled to exemption.\n\nPlaintiff responds its land should be found exempt because either\n\n(1) the land was actually used exclusively for religious purposes\n\nor (2) the land was being developed toward use for religious\n\npurposes.    As the land in question was used exclusively for\n\nreligious purposes, insofar as it was at least minimally used for\n\nreligious purposes, was not used for secular purposes, and was in\n\nthe actual process of development and adaptation for religious\n\nuse in the tax year in question, we affirm.\n\n                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n            Plaintiff's land in question is approximately seven\n\nacres at the intersection of Westchester Boulevard and Chatham\n\nRoad in Springfield, Illinois.    In May 1996, plaintiff acquired\n\nthe parcel by quitclaim deed from the Illinois District Council\n\nof the Assemblies of God.    Until tax year 2007, the parcel was\n\nassessed as agricultural land for property-tax purposes as\n\napproximately four of the seven acres were farmed by a nearby\n\nfarmer.   In 2005, this agricultural use ceased when plaintiff\n\n\n                                 - 2 -\n\fsold off approximately one acre of the parcel.   For tax year\n\n2007, the parcel was reassessed as commercial property.   This\n\nresulted in an increase in plaintiff's annual property-tax\n\nliability from $60 to more than $15,000.    Plaintiff's budget\n\ncould not cover the increased liability.\n\n          In May 2007, plaintiff's pastor, Danny L. Shaner, sent\n\na letter to taxing authorities listing plaintiff's activities on\n\nthe property in question.   The activities listed are: \"Services\";\n\n\"Prayer Walks\"; \"Youth activities: Camping, launching rockets,\n\nobserving the wildlife, various sports/games\";\n\n\"Picnics/Fellowship meals\"; \"Kid's Day (outreach into the neigh-\n\nborhood)\"; \"Work day\"; \"School Supplies/Free Lunch outreach\"; and\n\n\"Use of property (no charge) to other nonprofit groups (Sojourn\n\nShelter).\"   In June 2007, plaintiff applied for a religious\n\nexemption for the property taxes sought to be collected with the\n\nSangamon County board of review.   Later that month, the board of\n\nreview recommended the exemption be granted.\n\n          After the board of review made its recommendation, as a\n\nmatter of course, the Department inquired into plaintiff's use of\n\nthe land in question.   Specifically, the Department requested\n\nplaintiff (1) submit a list of all activities that took place on\n\nthe property after January 1, 2007, (2) describe where the\n\nproperty was located in relation to the church, and (3) indicate\n\nwhether the property was \"the location for the new church in the\n\nfloor plans submitted with the application.\"   In September 2007,\n\nplaintiff responded to the Department's inquiry.   In response to\n\n\n                               - 3 -\n\fthe Department's first request, plaintiff stated \"[t]here is only\n\na small shed for maintenance equipment on the property\" and\n\nlisted 12 specific dates between January and September 2007 on\n\nwhich the property was used other than for storage.   According to\n\nplaintiff, the property was used for eight prayer walks with\n\nparticipation by Pastor Shaner and, variously, plaintiff's\n\n\"leadership,\" the \"Capitol section leadership,\" and plaintiff's\n\ncongregation.   The property was also used for three \"leadership\n\nmeeting[s],\" a \"sectional meeting,\" three \"property development\n\nmeeting[s],\" and a \"leadership and maintenance training.\"     In\n\nresponse to the Department's second request, plaintiff stated it\n\nwas \"presently\" meeting for church services at the Illinois\n\nRetired Teacher's Association building on North Walnut Street.\n\nIn response to the Department's third request, plaintiff stated\n\nthe property in question was intended to be the site of the new\n\nchurch.   Specifically, plaintiff responded, \"We would like\n\nconstruction to begin as soon as possible, sometime late in 2008\n\nis our best hope.   We cannot begin until the tax issue is re-\n\nsolved and won't begin until we can build debt free.\"   In October\n\n2007, the Department denied the exemption, finding \"[t]he prop-\n\nerty is not in exempt use.\"\n\n          In December 2007, plaintiff requested a formal hearing\n\nwith the Department on the exemption.   In May 2008, the parties\n\nappeared at a hearing before an ALJ.    On the Department's motion,\n\nthe ALJ admitted a group of documents containing plaintiff's\n\nrequest for a formal hearing, the Department's denial of plain-\n\n\n                               - 4 -\n\ftiff's application for exemption, the board of review application\n\nand recommendation, the quitclaim deed by which plaintiff ac-\n\nquired the property, an \"Affidavit of Purpose of Plat,\" an\n\n\"Affidavit of Use\" (plaintiff's response to the Department's\n\nrequest for further information), plaintiff's constitution and\n\nbylaws, a 2006 notification from the Department of plaintiff's\n\nexemption from sales and use taxes, Pastor Shaner's May 2007\n\nletter listing uses of the property, and a photograph of the\n\nproperty.\n\n            In relevant part, plaintiff's constitution states\n\nplaintiff's purpose is \"[t]o conduct, in a Scriptural manner, the\n\nwork of world-wide evangelism and discipleship in obedience to\n\nthe command of the Lord Jesus.\"    Under its constitution, plain-\n\ntiff may \"own, hold in trust, use, sell[,] convey, mortgage,\n\nlease or otherwise dispose of any real estate or chattels as may\n\nbe necessary for the furtherance of its purposes.\"      The constitu-\n\ntion further sets forth procedural prerequisites to plaintiff's\n\nmortgaging real property.\n\n            Plaintiff's case at the hearing consisted relevantly of\n\nPastor Shaner's testimony and a copy of blueprints for a new\n\nchurch facility, dated March 2000.      Pastor Shaner testified he\n\nhad worked as plaintiff's pastor since 1991.      Until plaintiff\n\nacquired sole ownership of the property in 1996 by quitclaim\n\ndeed, it was held jointly by plaintiff and the Illinois District\n\nCouncil of the Assemblies of God.    The land at the intersection\n\nof Westchester Boulevard and Chatham Road was initially acquired\n\n\n                                - 5 -\n\fby the district council for no \"purpose other than to construct a\n\nchurch at that corner.\"    When Pastor Shaner began working for\n\nplaintiff, plaintiff had in place a three-phase, $3 million\n\nbuilding plan for constructing a new church facility on the land\n\nin question.     After plaintiff acquired sole ownership of the\n\nland, plaintiff scaled back its $3 million development plan to \"a\n\nlot less than $3 million.\"    Plaintiff maintained a \"building fund\n\nthat the people contribute to on a regular basis\" but did not\n\nraise funds specifically for developing the new church facility\n\nfor theological reasons.    Plaintiff preferred, if possible, to\n\nbuild its new facilities without incurring any debt.    Pastor\n\nShaner testified, \"It's not that we can't [borrow money for that\n\npurpose], but we don't want to make a payment where money can be\n\nbetter used somewhere else.\"    There was no testimony to establish\n\nhow much money had accumulated in the building fund.\n\n            Eventually, plaintiff engaged an architect to develop\n\nplans for the new church facility, which were drafted in March\n\n2000.   However, after a tornado struck plaintiff's land in 2006,\n\nplaintiff discovered these plans were obsolete and required\n\nrevision.    Pastor Shaner stated whether the architectural changes\n\nwould be pursued depended on the exemption status of plaintiff's\n\nland.   Until plaintiff could be certain of the land's status, the\n\nreassessment had \"ground [development plans] to a halt.\"    Plain-\n\ntiff was \"not prepared to be investing more finances into updat-\n\ning the blueprints\" until its tax liability was determined.\n\n            The only improvement ever actually built on the land\n\n\n                                - 6 -\n\fwas a shed used to store plaintiff's tractor, supplies, and\n\nrecords.    Occasionally, church leadership met and Pastor Shaner\n\ndid \"some counseling\" in the shed.      This counseling was \"some-\n\ntimes [of] a religious nature.\"    The shed was destroyed by the\n\n2006 tornado, and \"about everything\" stored in the shed except\n\nthe tractor was lost.    The shed was rebuilt within days of the\n\ntornado.\n\n            In 2005, plaintiff sold approximately one acre of its\n\nland to Sojourn Shelter and Services, Inc. (Sojourn), a non-\n\nprofit women's shelter for abused women and children.      As a\n\ncondition of the sale and of annexing plaintiff's land to the\n\nCity of Springfield, plaintiff was required to construct a new\n\nsewer line.    The construction of the sewer line cost between\n\n$18,000 and $20,000.    In connection with the land sale and\n\nannexation, plaintiff incurred approximately $3,000 or $3,500 in\n\nlegal fees.    Thereafter the ground was not farmed and the assess-\n\nment was changed from \"agricultural\" property to \"commercial\"\n\nproperty.\n\n            Pastor Shaner testified to various uses of the prop-\n\nerty.   The property was used for some services and prayer walks,\n\n\"free school supplies distributions with free lunch\" for neigh-\n\nboring children, fund-raisers conducted by and for the benefit of\n\nSojourn, and \"boy youth groups *** that shoot rockets and set up\n\ncamps and such as that.\"    Aside from \"the Sojourn activities,\"\n\nthese were \"activities of the church.\"      Pastor Shaner also\n\ntestified to the \"incidental\" use of the land by people who\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\f\"would stop out and, you know, meet and maybe have a lunch or\n\ntalk and pray.\"   The property was never leased or used for profit\n\nor with a view to profit.\n\n            In September 2008, the ALJ issued a written recommenda-\n\ntion that the Department deny plaintiff's religious exemption for\n\n2007.   The ALJ noted plaintiff could demonstrate entitlement to\n\nthe exemption by showing it actually either used or adapted and\n\ndeveloped the property for an exempt purpose.   The ALJ concluded\n\nplaintiff failed to demonstrate its entitlement to the exemption\n\nby clear and convincing evidence because it \"did not substantiate\n\nits oral evidence.\"   \"Although documents are not necessary to\n\nverify every single activity that took place\" on the land in\n\nquestion, the ALJ stated, \"some substantiation is necessary to\n\nverify that the property was used primarily for religious pur-\n\nposes and not used with a view to profit.\"   The ALJ noted some\n\ndocumentary evidence such as the pastor's calendar, church\n\nnewsletters, bulletins, minutes of meetings, or photographs is\n\nnecessary to verify the property was primarily used for religious\n\npurposes.   Accordingly, the ALJ recommended upholding the Depart-\n\nment's denial of the exemption.   In September 2008, the Depart-\n\nment accepted the ALJ's recommendation to deny the exemption and,\n\nin November 2008, the Department adopted the ALJ's recommendation\n\nto deny plaintiff's October 2008 request for rehearing.\n\n            In December 2008, plaintiff filed a complaint against\n\nthe Department and Sangamon County, acting through its State's\n\nAttorney, John Schmidt, for administrative review in the circuit\n\n\n                                - 8 -\n\fcourt.   In May 2010, the circuit court reversed the Department's\n\ndecision, ordering it to grant plaintiff the requested exemption.\n\nReaching the conclusion that the Department had erred, the court\n\nnoted, \"The unrebutted record establishes that the only use of\n\nthe property in 2007 was for exempt use only.    The Plaintiff\n\nowner has made efforts at development although some time has\n\npassed between stages of adaptation.\"\n\n          This appeal followed.\n\n                           II. ANALYSIS\n\n          On appeal, defendants, the Department and its Director,\n\nargue the agency decision to deny the exemption should be upheld.\n\nThey contend the ALJ did not err in concluding plaintiff failed\n\nto meet its burden of demonstrating its entitlement to the\n\nexemption by clear and convincing evidence.    Further, they\n\ncontend the evidence shows plaintiff is not entitled to the\n\nexemption.   In response, plaintiff maintains its only use of the\n\nland was for exempt purposes and, alternatively, the land was\n\nbeing adapted and developed for exempt purposes.    We agree with\n\nplaintiff and affirm the circuit court's judgment.\n\n                       A. Standard of Review\n\n          On appeal, we review the Department's decision, not the\n\ncircuit court's.   See Cinkus v. Village of Stickney Municipal\n\nOfficers Electoral Board, 228 Ill. 2d 200, 212, 886 N.E.2d 1011,\n\n1019 (2008).

However, actual use of property for\n\nexempt purposes encompasses its adaptation and development for\n\nexempt purposes.   That is, exemptions may be allowed \"where\n\nproperty is in the actual process of development and adaptation\n\nfor exempt use\" even if no actual use for exempt purposes is\n\nshown.   Weslin Properties, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, 157\n\nIll. App. 3d 580, 584, 510 N.E.2d 564, 567 (1987).    The relevant\n\n\n                               - 14 -\n\fquestion is whether the taxpayer's activities \"constituted\n\ndevelopment and adaptation for exempt use,\" in which case exemp-\n\ntion is permitted, or the taxpayer \"merely intended to develop\n\nthe property for such use,\" in which case taxation is required.\n\nId.\n\n            For example, in Weslin Properties, 157 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n586, 510 N.E.2d at 568, the Second District allowed a charitable\n\nexemption for the site of construction of a charitable urgent-\n\ncare facility where the \"plaintiff proceeded quickly through the\n\nplanning and design stages, expending large sums of money in the\n\nprocess.\"   The court noted \"the complexity of the architectural\n\nprocess of designing a site for a medical campus[] and of design-\n\ning the buildings to be located thereon\" and opined \"it seem[ed]\n\nvirtually impossible to begin construction immediately upon\n\npurchase of the land.\"    Id.   The court concluded the \"plaintiff's\n\nactivities in [the tax year for which the exemption was claimed]\n\nwere clearly beyond mere intention to convert the property for an\n\nexempt use, and actually constituted development and adaptation\n\nfor such use.\"    Id.\n\n            Under the exception to the actual-use requirement for\n\nadaptation and development, courts evaluate the taxpayer's\n\nactivities for reasonable diligence in light of practical consid-\n\nerations.   See, e.g., id. (noting \"it seem[ed] virtually impossi-\n\nble to begin construction immediately upon purchase of the land\"\n\ndue to the complexity of the project).    For example, in In re\n\nApplication of County Collector, 48 Ill. App. 3d 572, 576, 581-\n\n\n                                - 15 -\n\f82, 362 N.E.2d 1335, 1338, 1342 (1977), the Cook County registrar\n\nof titles claimed a public-use exemption for tax year 1969 for\n\nproperty condemned for construction of a \"massive highway pro-\n\nject,\" a leg of the Dan Ryan Expressway.   The land was condemned\n\nin 1967 and was being used as a highway \"at least as early as the\n\nsummer of 1973.\"    Id. at 581, 362 N.E.2d at 1342.   The First\n\nDistrict took notice \"of the fact that the construction of a\n\nmajor modern expressway, from its initial phases until comple-\n\ntion, may require a number of years, and that in order to prop-\n\nerly plan and carry out this construction it is necessary to\n\nacquire the needed land some time in advance.\"    Id.   The court\n\nnoted, further, the condemned land's \"eventual use as part of a\n\ncompleted highway may necessarily depend on its simply being\n\navailable in an essentially dormant state for some period of\n\ntime.\"   Id.   Accordingly, the court inferred such land, although\n\nnot actually being used as a highway in 1969, \"simply by virtue\n\nof its location and public ownership [was] in a very real sense\n\nin the actual process of development and adaptation for use by\n\nthe public.\"   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)    Id.   The court\n\nfound the construction of the highway and the actual use of the\n\nland for a public purpose occurred \"within a reasonable time\"\n\nafter the condemnation.    Id. at 581-82, 362 N.E.2d at 1342.     \"In\n\nsuch a situation,\" the court concluded, \"from the time the\n\ncondemnor acquired possession of the property until its full\n\ndevelopment for highway purposes, that property was in the\n\nnatural and necessary course of development and adaptation for\n\n\n                               - 16 -\n\fhighway use.\"   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)   Id. at 582,\n\n362 N.E.2d at 1342.    Accordingly, the court allowed the requested\n\nexemption.   Id.\n\n                   D. Exemption of Plaintiff's Land\n\n           The sole issue on appeal is whether plaintiff demon-\n\nstrated it was entitled to exemption for the land in question for\n\n2007.   This is a mixed question of law and fact as it required\n\nthe Department to determine whether the facts in this case\n\nsatisfied the statutory standard of exemption.    See American\n\nFederation of State, County & Municipal Employees, 216 Ill. 2d at\n\n577, 839 N.E.2d at 485 (quoted above).    Accordingly, we review\n\nthe Department's decision on this issue for clear error.    We\n\nconclude the Department clearly erred.\n\n           Initially, the parties both assert our analysis should\n\nfocus on plaintiff's activities vis-a-vis the land in question\n\nthat occurred in 2007.    Such a limitation is advisable, particu-\n\nlarly where plaintiff never intended to claim an exemption for\n\nreligious purposes until 2007, when its annual tax liability rose\n\ndramatically and unexpectedly from $60, which plaintiff was\n\nwilling and able to pay, to more than $15,000.    As noted above,\n\nthis change resulted from the unanticipated reclassification of\n\nplaintiff's land from \"agricultural\" to \"commercial\" property.\n\nPlaintiff presented evidence it intended, from the time it\n\nacquired the land, to build a church there.    However, plaintiff\n\ndid not apply for a religious exemption until the 2007 tax year.\n\nThe plaintiff is not required to show either actual use of its\n\n\n                                - 17 -\n\fland for religious purposes or development and adaptation for\n\nsuch use in years for which it chose not to claim a religious\n\nexemption.\n\n           As a result of this limitation on our focus, we will\n\nnot consider plaintiff's pre- or post-2007 activities.   On one\n\nhand, this means our analysis is not affected by the circum-\n\nstances of plaintiff's acquisition of the land, sale of a portion\n\nthereof to Sojourn, annexation of the land to Springfield, or\n\nextension of gas and sewer lines to the land.   Further, plain-\n\ntiff's obtaining blueprints for its prospective church building\n\nin 2000 is relevant to our analysis only insofar as its posses-\n\nsion of those plans in 2007 affects the amount of work yet\n\nrequired to carry out the development and adaptation of the land\n\nfor religious use as plaintiff intended in 2007.   On the other\n\nhand, we will not hold the lapse of time between 1996, when\n\nplaintiff acquired sole ownership of the land, and 2007, when the\n\nintended church facility had yet to be constructed, against\n\nplaintiff as evidence of its mere intention to establish a\n\nreligious use of the land.\n\n           Having defined the scope of our inquiry, we note the\n\nevidence presented in the record on appeal is remarkably scant.\n\nFor instance, there is no evidence of the amount of money in\n\nplaintiff's building fund or the amount raised for that fund in\n\n2007.   Nor is there evidence of plaintiff's budget for the\n\nproposed construction.   Further, the evidence regarding plain-\n\ntiff's activities in 2007 lacks specific potentially relevant\n\n\n                              - 18 -\n\fdetails, including the frequency of Pastor Shaner's religious\n\ncounseling, the attendance figures and particular subject matters\n\nof the prayer walks and various meetings, and the discrete\n\naccomplishments of the property-development meetings.   Neverthe-\n\nless, sufficient evidence informs our conclusion plaintiff is\n\nentitled to a property-tax exemption for the land in question for\n\nthe year 2007.\n\n          In 2007, plaintiff's property was actually used primar-\n\nily for religious purposes.   The evidence demonstrates plaintiff\n\nmade some use of its land for religious purposes, which is\n\nsufficient to satisfy the actual-use requirement.   Namely,\n\nplaintiff conducted church activities on the land on at least 12\n\nspecific occasions identified by Pastor Shaner.   Further, the use\n\nby Sojourn, which Pastor Shaner distinguished from the \"activi-\n\nties of the church,\" appears to have been less frequent and,\n\nthus, does not affect our conclusion the land was used primarily\n\nfor religious purposes for two reasons.   First, given the fellow-\n\nship plaintiff developed with Sojourn, Sojourn's use arguably\n\nadvanced plaintiff's religious purpose.   Second, regardless of\n\nits religious or secular character, any such use was secondary to\n\nplaintiff's own use for religious purposes.   Neither plaintiff\n\nnor any other organization used plaintiff's land for profit.\n\n          Further, plaintiff's land was in the actual process of\n\ndevelopment and adaptation for religious use within the meaning\n\nof that doctrine.   Under Application of County Collector, a\n\nreasonable amount of time is allowed for development and adapta-\n\n\n                              - 19 -\n\ftion for exempt uses during which land may qualify for exemption\n\neven if vacant and dormant.   What is reasonable is determined\n\nwith respect to the particular circumstances of each case.   In\n\nthis case, in 2007, plaintiff's plan to construct a church\n\nfacility on its land rose above a mere intention to develop.\n\n           Plaintiff held three property-development meetings in\n\n2007.   Although the specific substance of those meetings is not\n\nrevealed by the record, we find this activity amounts to develop-\n\nment and adaptation in light of plaintiff's financial situation\n\nand in consideration of the suddenness of its perceived need to\n\nqualify for a religious-use exemption in 2007.   While the amount\n\nof money actually held by plaintiff for development is unknown,\n\nplaintiff presented evidence it did not have sufficient funds to\n\ncover its $15,000-plus property-tax liability for 2007 and it\n\ncontinued, in 2007, to segregate some of the monetary donations\n\nit received into a building fund.   From this evidence, we infer\n\nplaintiff was financially unable at the time to undertake steps\n\nbeyond mere planning and development meetings.   Further, plain-\n\ntiff's demand for a religious exemption was unforeseen.   Under\n\nthese circumstances, it was reasonable for plaintiff to proceed\n\nwith the initial phases of development in the manner it employed.\n\n           Our conclusion depends on all of the specific circum-\n\nstances of this case.   We note these circumstances may change\n\nover time, even with respect to these same parties and this same\n\nparcel of land.   The timing of plaintiff's activities in relation\n\nto its application for the religious exemption is essential to\n\n\n                              - 20 -\n\four determination its development activities were reasonable.\n\nFurther, our conclusion plaintiff is entitled to exemption for\n\nits land does not result solely from our consideration of either\n\nplaintiff's actual use or the steps it took toward development\n\nand adaptation.   Rather, this conclusion is based on our consid-\n\neration of the totality of the circumstances.\n\n                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated, we affirm the circuit court's\n\njudgment reversing the Department's decision to deny the exemp-\n\ntion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 21 -\n\f",

Plaintiff challenged the\n\nassessment, claiming its property was exempt from taxation as it\n\nwas used exclusively for religious purposes.    The Sangamon County\n\nboard of review agreed with plaintiff and determined the property\n\nshould be exempt.   After review of the board's decision, defen-\n\ndants, the Illinois Department of Revenue (Department) and its\n\nDirector, Brian A. Hamer, denied the exemption.    Plaintiff\n\nrequested a formal hearing.    After a hearing before an adminis-\n\ntrative law judge (ALJ), the ALJ recommended the exemption be\n\fdenied, and her determination was accepted by the Department and\n\nits Director.    On administrative review, the circuit court\n\nreversed, finding the property was exempt.\n\n            The Department and its Director appeal, arguing the\n\nagency determination the property was not exempt should be upheld\n\nand the circuit court's judgment reversed.    Specifically, these\n\ndefendants argue (1) plaintiff submitted insufficient evidence\n\nits land qualified for exemption and (2) the evidence actually\n\nsubmitted shows plaintiff's land is not entitled to exemption.\n\nPlaintiff responds its land should be found exempt because either\n\n(1) the land was actually used exclusively for religious purposes\n\nor (2) the land was being developed toward use for religious\n\npurposes.    As the land in question was used exclusively for\n\nreligious purposes, insofar as it was at least minimally used for\n\nreligious purposes, was not used for secular purposes, and was in\n\nthe actual process of development and adaptation for religious\n\nuse in the tax year in question, we affirm.\n\n                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n            Plaintiff's land in question is approximately seven\n\nacres at the intersection of Westchester Boulevard and Chatham\n\nRoad in Springfield, Illinois.    In May 1996, plaintiff acquired\n\nthe parcel by quitclaim deed from the Illinois District Council\n\nof the Assemblies of God.    Until tax year 2007, the parcel was\n\nassessed as agricultural land for property-tax purposes as\n\napproximately four of the seven acres were farmed by a nearby\n\nfarmer.   In 2005, this agricultural use ceased when plaintiff\n\n\n                                 - 2 -\n\fsold off approximately one acre of the parcel.   For tax year\n\n2007, the parcel was reassessed as commercial property.   This\n\nresulted in an increase in plaintiff's annual property-tax\n\nliability from $60 to more than $15,000.    Plaintiff's budget\n\ncould not cover the increased liability.\n\n          In May 2007, plaintiff's pastor, Danny L. Shaner, sent\n\na letter to taxing authorities listing plaintiff's activities on\n\nthe property in question.   The activities listed are: \"Services\";\n\n\"Prayer Walks\"; \"Youth activities: Camping, launching rockets,\n\nobserving the wildlife, various sports/games\";\n\n\"Picnics/Fellowship meals\"; \"Kid's Day (outreach into the neigh-\n\nborhood)\"; \"Work day\"; \"School Supplies/Free Lunch outreach\"; and\n\n\"Use of property (no charge) to other nonprofit groups (Sojourn\n\nShelter).\"   In June 2007, plaintiff applied for a religious\n\nexemption for the property taxes sought to be collected with the\n\nSangamon County board of review.   Later that month, the board of\n\nreview recommended the exemption be granted.\n\n          After the board of review made its recommendation, as a\n\nmatter of course, the Department inquired into plaintiff's use of\n\nthe land in question.   Specifically, the Department requested\n\nplaintiff (1) submit a list of all activities that took place on\n\nthe property after January 1, 2007, (2) describe where the\n\nproperty was located in relation to the church, and (3) indicate\n\nwhether the property was \"the location for the new church in the\n\nfloor plans submitted with the application.\"   In September 2007,\n\nplaintiff responded to the Department's inquiry.   In response to\n\n\n                               - 3 -\n\fthe Department's first request, plaintiff stated \"[t]here is only\n\na small shed for maintenance equipment on the property\" and\n\nlisted 12 specific dates between January and September 2007 on\n\nwhich the property was used other than for storage.   According to\n\nplaintiff, the property was used for eight prayer walks with\n\nparticipation by Pastor Shaner and, variously, plaintiff's\n\n\"leadership,\" the \"Capitol section leadership,\" and plaintiff's\n\ncongregation.   The property was also used for three \"leadership\n\nmeeting[s],\" a \"sectional meeting,\" three \"property development\n\nmeeting[s],\" and a \"leadership and maintenance training.\"     In\n\nresponse to the Department's second request, plaintiff stated it\n\nwas \"presently\" meeting for church services at the Illinois\n\nRetired Teacher's Association building on North Walnut Street.\n\nIn response to the Department's third request, plaintiff stated\n\nthe property in question was intended to be the site of the new\n\nchurch.   Specifically, plaintiff responded, \"We would like\n\nconstruction to begin as soon as possible, sometime late in 2008\n\nis our best hope.   We cannot begin until the tax issue is re-\n\nsolved and won't begin until we can build debt free.\"   In October\n\n2007, the Department denied the exemption, finding \"[t]he prop-\n\nerty is not in exempt use.\"\n\n          In December 2007, plaintiff requested a formal hearing\n\nwith the Department on the exemption.   In May 2008, the parties\n\nappeared at a hearing before an ALJ.    On the Department's motion,\n\nthe ALJ admitted a group of documents containing plaintiff's\n\nrequest for a formal hearing, the Department's denial of plain-\n\n\n                               - 4 -\n\ftiff's application for exemption, the board of review application\n\nand recommendation, the quitclaim deed by which plaintiff ac-\n\nquired the property, an \"Affidavit of Purpose of Plat,\" an\n\n\"Affidavit of Use\" (plaintiff's response to the Department's\n\nrequest for further information), plaintiff's constitution and\n\nbylaws, a 2006 notification from the Department of plaintiff's\n\nexemption from sales and use taxes, Pastor Shaner's May 2007\n\nletter listing uses of the property, and a photograph of the\n\nproperty.\n\n            In relevant part, plaintiff's constitution states\n\nplaintiff's purpose is \"[t]o conduct, in a Scriptural manner, the\n\nwork of world-wide evangelism and discipleship in obedience to\n\nthe command of the Lord Jesus.\"    Under its constitution, plain-\n\ntiff may \"own, hold in trust, use, sell[,] convey, mortgage,\n\nlease or otherwise dispose of any real estate or chattels as may\n\nbe necessary for the furtherance of its purposes.\"      The constitu-\n\ntion further sets forth procedural prerequisites to plaintiff's\n\nmortgaging real property.\n\n            Plaintiff's case at the hearing consisted relevantly of\n\nPastor Shaner's testimony and a copy of blueprints for a new\n\nchurch facility, dated March 2000.      Pastor Shaner testified he\n\nhad worked as plaintiff's pastor since 1991.      Until plaintiff\n\nacquired sole ownership of the property in 1996 by quitclaim\n\ndeed, it was held jointly by plaintiff and the Illinois District\n\nCouncil of the Assemblies of God.    The land at the intersection\n\nof Westchester Boulevard and Chatham Road was initially acquired\n\n\n                                - 5 -\n\fby the district council for no \"purpose other than to construct a\n\nchurch at that corner.\"    When Pastor Shaner began working for\n\nplaintiff, plaintiff had in place a three-phase, $3 million\n\nbuilding plan for constructing a new church facility on the land\n\nin question.     After plaintiff acquired sole ownership of the\n\nland, plaintiff scaled back its $3 million development plan to \"a\n\nlot less than $3 million.\"    Plaintiff maintained a \"building fund\n\nthat the people contribute to on a regular basis\" but did not\n\nraise funds specifically for developing the new church facility\n\nfor theological reasons.    Plaintiff preferred, if possible, to\n\nbuild its new facilities without incurring any debt.    Pastor\n\nShaner testified, \"It's not that we can't [borrow money for that\n\npurpose], but we don't want to make a payment where money can be\n\nbetter used somewhere else.\"    There was no testimony to establish\n\nhow much money had accumulated in the building fund.\n\n            Eventually, plaintiff engaged an architect to develop\n\nplans for the new church facility, which were drafted in March\n\n2000.   However, after a tornado struck plaintiff's land in 2006,\n\nplaintiff discovered these plans were obsolete and required\n\nrevision.    Pastor Shaner stated whether the architectural changes\n\nwould be pursued depended on the exemption status of plaintiff's\n\nland.   Until plaintiff could be certain of the land's status, the\n\nreassessment had \"ground [development plans] to a halt.\"    Plain-\n\ntiff was \"not prepared to be investing more finances into updat-\n\ning the blueprints\" until its tax liability was determined.\n\n            The only improvement ever actually built on the land\n\n\n                                - 6 -\n\fwas a shed used to store plaintiff's tractor, supplies, and\n\nrecords.    Occasionally, church leadership met and Pastor Shaner\n\ndid \"some counseling\" in the shed.      This counseling was \"some-\n\ntimes [of] a religious nature.\"    The shed was destroyed by the\n\n2006 tornado, and \"about everything\" stored in the shed except\n\nthe tractor was lost.    The shed was rebuilt within days of the\n\ntornado.\n\n            In 2005, plaintiff sold approximately one acre of its\n\nland to Sojourn Shelter and Services, Inc. (Sojourn), a non-\n\nprofit women's shelter for abused women and children.      As a\n\ncondition of the sale and of annexing plaintiff's land to the\n\nCity of Springfield, plaintiff was required to construct a new\n\nsewer line.    The construction of the sewer line cost between\n\n$18,000 and $20,000.    In connection with the land sale and\n\nannexation, plaintiff incurred approximately $3,000 or $3,500 in\n\nlegal fees.    Thereafter the ground was not farmed and the assess-\n\nment was changed from \"agricultural\" property to \"commercial\"\n\nproperty.\n\n            Pastor Shaner testified to various uses of the prop-\n\nerty.   The property was used for some services and prayer walks,\n\n\"free school supplies distributions with free lunch\" for neigh-\n\nboring children, fund-raisers conducted by and for the benefit of\n\nSojourn, and \"boy youth groups *** that shoot rockets and set up\n\ncamps and such as that.\"    Aside from \"the Sojourn activities,\"\n\nthese were \"activities of the church.\"      Pastor Shaner also\n\ntestified to the \"incidental\" use of the land by people who\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\f\"would stop out and, you know, meet and maybe have a lunch or\n\ntalk and pray.\"   The property was never leased or used for profit\n\nor with a view to profit.\n\n            In September 2008, the ALJ issued a written recommenda-\n\ntion that the Department deny plaintiff's religious exemption for\n\n2007.   The ALJ noted plaintiff could demonstrate entitlement to\n\nthe exemption by showing it actually either used or adapted and\n\ndeveloped the property for an exempt purpose.   The ALJ concluded\n\nplaintiff failed to demonstrate its entitlement to the exemption\n\nby clear and convincing evidence because it \"did not substantiate\n\nits oral evidence.\"   \"Although documents are not necessary to\n\nverify every single activity that took place\" on the land in\n\nquestion, the ALJ stated, \"some substantiation is necessary to\n\nverify that the property was used primarily for religious pur-\n\nposes and not used with a view to profit.\"   The ALJ noted some\n\ndocumentary evidence such as the pastor's calendar, church\n\nnewsletters, bulletins, minutes of meetings, or photographs is\n\nnecessary to verify the property was primarily used for religious\n\npurposes.   Accordingly, the ALJ recommended upholding the Depart-\n\nment's denial of the exemption.   In September 2008, the Depart-\n\nment accepted the ALJ's recommendation to deny the exemption and,\n\nin November 2008, the Department adopted the ALJ's recommendation\n\nto deny plaintiff's October 2008 request for rehearing.\n\n            In December 2008, plaintiff filed a complaint against\n\nthe Department and Sangamon County, acting through its State's\n\nAttorney, John Schmidt, for administrative review in the circuit\n\n\n                                - 8 -\n\fcourt.   In May 2010, the circuit court reversed the Department's\n\ndecision, ordering it to grant plaintiff the requested exemption.\n\nReaching the conclusion that the Department had erred, the court\n\nnoted, \"The unrebutted record establishes that the only use of\n\nthe property in 2007 was for exempt use only.    The Plaintiff\n\nowner has made efforts at development although some time has\n\npassed between stages of adaptation.\"\n\n          This appeal followed.\n\n                           II. ANALYSIS\n\n          On appeal, defendants, the Department and its Director,\n\nargue the agency decision to deny the exemption should be upheld.\n\nThey contend the ALJ did not err in concluding plaintiff failed\n\nto meet its burden of demonstrating its entitlement to the\n\nexemption by clear and convincing evidence.    Further, they\n\ncontend the evidence shows plaintiff is not entitled to the\n\nexemption.   In response, plaintiff maintains its only use of the\n\nland was for exempt purposes and, alternatively, the land was\n\nbeing adapted and developed for exempt purposes.    We agree with\n\nplaintiff and affirm the circuit court's judgment.\n\n                       A.

The land was condemned\n\nin 1967 and was being used as a highway \"at least as early as the\n\nsummer of 1973.\"    Id. at 581, 362 N.E.2d at 1342.   The First\n\nDistrict took notice \"of the fact that the construction of a\n\nmajor modern expressway, from its initial phases until comple-\n\ntion, may require a number of years, and that in order to prop-\n\nerly plan and carry out this construction it is necessary to\n\nacquire the needed land some time in advance.\"    Id.   The court\n\nnoted, further, the condemned land's \"eventual use as part of a\n\ncompleted highway may necessarily depend on its simply being\n\navailable in an essentially dormant state for some period of\n\ntime.\"   Id.   Accordingly, the court inferred such land, although\n\nnot actually being used as a highway in 1969, \"simply by virtue\n\nof its location and public ownership [was] in a very real sense\n\nin the actual process of development and adaptation for use by\n\nthe public.\"   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)    Id.   The court\n\nfound the construction of the highway and the actual use of the\n\nland for a public purpose occurred \"within a reasonable time\"\n\nafter the condemnation.    Id. at 581-82, 362 N.E.2d at 1342.     \"In\n\nsuch a situation,\" the court concluded, \"from the time the\n\ncondemnor acquired possession of the property until its full\n\ndevelopment for highway purposes, that property was in the\n\nnatural and necessary course of development and adaptation for\n\n\n                               - 16 -\n\fhighway use.\"   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)   Id. at 582,\n\n362 N.E.2d at 1342.    Accordingly, the court allowed the requested\n\nexemption.   Id.\n\n                   D. Exemption of Plaintiff's Land\n\n           The sole issue on appeal is whether plaintiff demon-\n\nstrated it was entitled to exemption for the land in question for\n\n2007.   This is a mixed question of law and fact as it required\n\nthe Department to determine whether the facts in this case\n\nsatisfied the statutory standard of exemption.    See American\n\nFederation of State, County & Municipal Employees, 216 Ill. 2d at\n\n577, 839 N.E.2d at 485 (quoted above).    Accordingly, we review\n\nthe Department's decision on this issue for clear error.    We\n\nconclude the Department clearly erred.\n\n           Initially, the parties both assert our analysis should\n\nfocus on plaintiff's activities vis-a-vis the land in question\n\nthat occurred in 2007.    Such a limitation is advisable, particu-\n\nlarly where plaintiff never intended to claim an exemption for\n\nreligious purposes until 2007, when its annual tax liability rose\n\ndramatically and unexpectedly from $60, which plaintiff was\n\nwilling and able to pay, to more than $15,000.    As noted above,\n\nthis change resulted from the unanticipated reclassification of\n\nplaintiff's land from \"agricultural\" to \"commercial\" property.\n\nPlaintiff presented evidence it intended, from the time it\n\nacquired the land, to build a church there.    However, plaintiff\n\ndid not apply for a religious exemption until the 2007 tax year.\n\nThe plaintiff is not required to show either actual use of its\n\n\n                                - 17 -\n\fland for religious purposes or development and adaptation for\n\nsuch use in years for which it chose not to claim a religious\n\nexemption.\n\n           As a result of this limitation on our focus, we will\n\nnot consider plaintiff's pre- or post-2007 activities.   On one\n\nhand, this means our analysis is not affected by the circum-\n\nstances of plaintiff's acquisition of the land, sale of a portion\n\nthereof to Sojourn, annexation of the land to Springfield, or\n\nextension of gas and sewer lines to the land.   Further, plain-\n\ntiff's obtaining blueprints for its prospective church building\n\nin 2000 is relevant to our analysis only insofar as its posses-\n\nsion of those plans in 2007 affects the amount of work yet\n\nrequired to carry out the development and adaptation of the land\n\nfor religious use as plaintiff intended in 2007.   On the other\n\nhand, we will not hold the lapse of time between 1996, when\n\nplaintiff acquired sole ownership of the land, and 2007, when the\n\nintended church facility had yet to be constructed, against\n\nplaintiff as evidence of its mere intention to establish a\n\nreligious use of the land.\n\n           Having defined the scope of our inquiry, we note the\n\nevidence presented in the record on appeal is remarkably scant.\n\nFor instance, there is no evidence of the amount of money in\n\nplaintiff's building fund or the amount raised for that fund in\n\n2007.   Nor is there evidence of plaintiff's budget for the\n\nproposed construction.   Further, the evidence regarding plain-\n\ntiff's activities in 2007 lacks specific potentially relevant\n\n\n                              - 18 -\n\fdetails, including the frequency of Pastor Shaner's religious\n\ncounseling, the attendance figures and particular subject matters\n\nof the prayer walks and various meetings, and the discrete\n\naccomplishments of the property-development meetings.   Neverthe-\n\nless, sufficient evidence informs our conclusion plaintiff is\n\nentitled to a property-tax exemption for the land in question for\n\nthe year 2007.\n\n          In 2007, plaintiff's property was actually used primar-\n\nily for religious purposes.   The evidence demonstrates plaintiff\n\nmade some use of its land for religious purposes, which is\n\nsufficient to satisfy the actual-use requirement.   Namely,\n\nplaintiff conducted church activities on the land on at least 12\n\nspecific occasions identified by Pastor Shaner.   Further, the use\n\nby Sojourn, which Pastor Shaner distinguished from the \"activi-\n\nties of the church,\" appears to have been less frequent and,\n\nthus, does not affect our conclusion the land was used primarily\n\nfor religious purposes for two reasons.   First, given the fellow-\n\nship plaintiff developed with Sojourn, Sojourn's use arguably\n\nadvanced plaintiff's religious purpose.   Second, regardless of\n\nits religious or secular character, any such use was secondary to\n\nplaintiff's own use for religious purposes.   Neither plaintiff\n\nnor any other organization used plaintiff's land for profit.\n\n          Further, plaintiff's land was in the actual process of\n\ndevelopment and adaptation for religious use within the meaning\n\nof that doctrine.   Under Application of County Collector, a\n\nreasonable amount of time is allowed for development and adapta-\n\n\n                              - 19 -\n\ftion for exempt uses during which land may qualify for exemption\n\neven if vacant and dormant.   What is reasonable is determined\n\nwith respect to the particular circumstances of each case.   In\n\nthis case, in 2007, plaintiff's plan to construct a church\n\nfacility on its land rose above a mere intention to develop.\n\n           Plaintiff held three property-development meetings in\n\n2007.   Although the specific substance of those meetings is not\n\nrevealed by the record, we find this activity amounts to develop-\n\nment and adaptation in light of plaintiff's financial situation\n\nand in consideration of the suddenness of its perceived need to\n\nqualify for a religious-use exemption in 2007.   While the amount\n\nof money actually held by plaintiff for development is unknown,\n\nplaintiff presented evidence it did not have sufficient funds to\n\ncover its $15,000-plus property-tax liability for 2007 and it\n\ncontinued, in 2007, to segregate some of the monetary donations\n\nit received into a building fund.   From this evidence, we infer\n\nplaintiff was financially unable at the time to undertake steps\n\nbeyond mere planning and development meetings.   Further, plain-\n\ntiff's demand for a religious exemption was unforeseen.   Under\n\nthese circumstances, it was reasonable for plaintiff to proceed\n\nwith the initial phases of development in the manner it employed.\n\n           Our conclusion depends on all of the specific circum-\n\nstances of this case.   We note these circumstances may change\n\nover time, even with respect to these same parties and this same\n\nparcel of land.   The timing of plaintiff's activities in relation\n\nto its application for the religious exemption is essential to\n\n\n                              - 20 -\n\four determination its development activities were reasonable.\n\nFurther, our conclusion plaintiff is entitled to exemption for\n\nits land does not result solely from our consideration of either\n\nplaintiff's actual use or the steps it took toward development\n\nand adaptation.   Rather, this conclusion is based on our consid-\n\neration of the totality of the circumstances.\n\n                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated, we affirm the circuit court's\n\njudgment reversing the Department's decision to deny the exemp-\n\ntion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 21 -\n\f</pre>",
