A\r\njury found that Cresthaven negligently caused injury and death to Granger and awarded\r\n$4.5 million in survival damages and $4.5 million in wrongful death damages.  There was\r\nno finding of gross negligence.  The court signed a judgment awarding all three appellants\r\n$6,051,259.20 in damages jointly and severally from Cresthaven, Cantex, and the five\r\ngeneral partners of Cantex.  That judgment has resulted in this appeal by all parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn eight issues, appellants claim (1) the judgment erroneously awarded damages\r\nexceeding the statutory limit on civil liability in section 11.01(a) of article 4590i of the\r\nTexas Revised Civil Statutes; (2) the judgment erroneously awarded damages to Lynette\r\nCalvert and Denise Corbello, who had non-suited with prejudice all their claims against\r\nappellants; (3) the judgment erroneously awarded damages against Cresthaven and the\r\nfive general partners of Cantex because there was no evidence presented of their liability\r\nand there were no affirmative jury findings of liability against them; (4) the trial court erred\r\nin submitting a spoliation instruction in the jury charge because the three elements of a\r\nspoliation complaint were not established and Cresthaven rebutted the spoliation\r\npresumption with a reasonable explanation; (5) the damages awarded for the survival\r\naction are excessive and not supported by factually sufficient evidence; (6) the damages\r\nawarded for the wrongful death action are excessive and not supported by factually\r\nsufficient evidence; (7) the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of appellees' medical\r\nexpert because he was not qualified to render expert medical opinions on the issues in this\r\ncase; and (8) there is no evidence to establish the standard of care, breach of the standard\r\nand proximate causation.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees, as cross-appellants, contend that (1) the benefits of article 4590i do not\r\nextend to general partners who have admitted they are not health care providers; and (2)\r\neven if article 4590i is applicable to the general partners, the damage cap amount should\r\nby multiplied by the number of defendants, which would include the general partners. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis lawsuit was brought as a health care liability claim under the Medical Liability\r\nand Insurance Improvement Act, article 4590i of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes.  Under\r\nthat statute, there is a cap on damages recoverable from a health care provider. \r\nSpecifically, the statute provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(a) In an action on a health care liability claim where final judgment is\r\nrendered against a physician or health care provider, the limit of civil liability\r\nfor damages of the physician or health care provider shall be limited to an\r\namount not to exceed $500,000.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i § 11.02 (a) (Vernon Supp. 1999).  The cap is further\r\nsubject to a consumer price index adjustment.  <em>Id. </em>§ 11.04.  The cap applies to both\r\nwrongful death and survival actions.  <em>Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld</em>, 34 S.W.3d\r\n887, 902 (Tex. 2000); <em>Rose v. Doctors Hosp., </em>801 S.W.2d 841, 848 (Tex. 1990).   It is the\r\ninterpretation of this provision and its applicability to the judgment in this lawsuit that is the\r\nsubject of dispute between the parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants allege in their first issue that the trial court awarded damages that\r\nexceeded the civil liability cap.  They contend that the trial court should have limited\r\ndamages to one cap, including prejudgment interest computed at the time the judgment\r\nwas signed or $1,413,008.13.  Alternatively, if prejudgment interest is not appropriately\r\nincluded in the liability cap, the judgment should have included prejudgment interest\r\ncomputed on the amount of capped damages, the judgment should not have included\r\nprejudgment interest on the wrongful death damages, and accrual of prejudgment interest\r\nshould have been tolled by lengthy periods of delay caused by appellees.  The cross-issues of appellees are related to these arguments, and we will address them in our\r\ndiscussion of these matters.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants initially argue that, because the liability of only one defendant,\r\nCresthaven, was submitted to the jury, the judgment is limited to a single cap.  It has been\r\nheld that the damages provision is to be applied on a \"per defendant\" basis.  <em>Rose, </em>801\r\nS.W.2d at 847.   Thus, a plaintiff who recovers against more than one defendant may\r\nobtain a judgment in excess of the cap as long as the combined statutory liability of all\r\ndefendants is not exceeded.  <em>Id.  </em>Further, the cap applicable to a single defendant who is\r\njointly and severally liable in a comparative negligence situation is not increased by the\r\nnumber of culpable defendants.  <em>Columbia Hosp. Corp. of Houston v. Moore, </em>43 S.W.3d\r\n553, 556 (Tex.App.--Houston [1<sup>st</sup> Dist.] 2001, pet. granted).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConversely, appellees argue in response to this issue and also in their first cross-issue that, because the five general partners of the owner and operator of the nursing\r\nhome have admitted they are not health care providers, they are not entitled to the\r\nprotection of the cap.  Alternatively, even if the cap is available to all of the defendants,\r\nthere are six culpable defendants against whom the court has rendered judgment, and\r\ntherefore the cap should be multiplied by six.  This is so, appellees posit, because it is not\r\nnecessary for the defendant to have been found liable by a jury for a defendant to be\r\nculpable pursuant to the judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOnly the issue of Cresthaven's negligence was submitted to the jury.  However, the\r\njudgment recites that appellees may recover jointly and severally from Cresthaven, Cantex,\r\nand the five general partners of Cantex.  While appellees assert that Cantex is liable\r\nbecause it is the owner and operator of Cresthaven, they do not contend that both Cantex\r\nand Cresthaven are culpable defendants, even though the jury found Cresthaven to be\r\nnegligent and judgment was rendered against both parties.  Therefore, appellees \r\napparently recognize that Cresthaven and Cantex are not two separate legal entities, and\r\nCantex is responsible for the liabilities of Cresthaven because Cantex did business as\r\nCresthaven. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs noted, appellees did not seek recovery against the general partners in their\r\npleadings as joint tortfeasors, and no issue as to the negligence of the general partners\r\nwas submitted to the jury.  Therefore, even if the general partners have judicially admitted\r\nthat they are not health care providers, as appellees contend, it is irrelevant since\r\nappellees did not seek damages from the general partners on the basis that they were\r\nhealth care providers.  The basis upon which appellees sought damages against the\r\ngeneral partners, and upon which the judgment against them was entered, is that statutory\r\nlaw imposes joint and several liability on general partners for the debts and obligations of\r\na partnership making them vicariously liable.  Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6132b-3.04.\r\nVicarious liability is a judicially created vehicle for enforcing remedies for wrongs.  <em>Dutcher\r\nv. Owens, </em>647 S.W.2d 948, 950-51 (Tex. 1983).  It is the imposition of liability on one party\r\nfor the actionable conduct of another based on a relationship between the parties.  Black's\r\nLaw Dictionary 1566 (6<sup>th</sup> ed. 1990).  No liability under the law was imposed on the general\r\npartners independent of their status as a partner.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTherefore, the general partners can only be liable for the debt incurred by Cantex\r\nd/b/a Cresthaven.  It is appropriate to include them in the judgment, but not to increase the\r\namount of the judgment by treating each general partner as a tortfeasor in its own right. \r\nWe believe this interpretation is consistent with the stated purposes of the Medical Liability\r\nand Insurance Improvement Act, one of which is to decrease the cost of claims and assure\r\nthat awards are rationally related to actual damages.  <em>See </em>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art.\r\n4590i § 1.02(b)(2) (Vernon Supp. 1999).  Otherwise, the amount of an award against a\r\nhealth care provider could be doubled simply by the fact it has four general partners\r\ninstead of two.  Thus, the judgment is limited by a single cap of $500,000 adjusted by the\r\nconsumer price index. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants also contend that prejudgment interest is included within the section\r\n11.02 cap on damages.  This question has not been definitively answered by the Texas\r\nSupreme Court.  In <em>Auld,</em> the court concluded that prejudgment interest under the general\r\nprejudgment interest statute<sup> (3)</sup></span><span> was included in the damages cap.  <em>Auld, </em>34 S.W.3d at 900-01.  However, the majority opinion specifically declined to address whether sections 16.01\r\nand 16.02 of article 4590i, added in 1995, conflict with this interpretation.  Pursuant to\r\nsection 16.02, judgments must include prejudgment interest on past damages found by the\r\ntrier of fact, but are not to include prejudgment interest on future damages.  Tex. Rev. Civ.\r\nStat. Ann. art. 4590i § 16.02(b) (Vernon Supp. 1999).  Nevertheless, in a concurring and\r\ndissenting opinion, four justices indicated their belief that this section confirms that\r\nprejudgment interest is not subject to the cap.  <em>Auld</em>, 34 S.W.3d at 908.  More recently, the\r\nHouston Court of Appeals ruled that the majority opinion in <em>Auld </em>with respect to\r\nprejudgment interest under the general statute was not binding when prejudgment interest\r\nwas awarded under the more recent provisions of the Medical Liability and Insurance\r\nImprovement Act, which shows a legislative intent to exclude prejudgment interest from the\r\ncap.  <em>Moore, </em>43 S.W.3d at 562.     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe agree with the Houston court that the holding in <em>Auld </em>is not binding, and we\r\nmust determine the effect of the legislature having added Subchapter P dealing with\r\nprejudgment interest to the act and reconcile it with the liability limits in Subchapter K.  We\r\nnote initially that section 11.02 of Subchapter K states that where final judgment is\r\nrendered against a physician or health care provider, \"the limit of civil liability for damages\r\nof the physician or health care provider shall be limited to an amount not to exceed\r\n$500,000.\"  Thus, the cap applies to damages, not the amount of the judgment.  Further,\r\nthe cap does not include the amount of damages awarded on claims for necessary\r\nmedical, hospital, and custodial care.  Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. § 11.02(b) (Vernon Supp.\r\n1999).  However, in Subchapter P, section 16.02 provides that the <span>judgment</span> must include\r\nprejudgment interest on past damages, but shall not include prejudgment interest on future\r\ndamages.  <em>Id. </em>§ 16.02(b).  Thus, it seems clear that the legislature intended to make a\r\ndistinction between damages awarded and the final judgment by providing that the cap\r\napplies to the damages awarded, but prejudgment interest on past damages must be\r\nincluded in the judgment.  Further, if the legislature had intended the cap to apply to\r\nprejudgment interest, it would surely have made that provision.  We believe this is a logical\r\ninterpretation of the act relying on the language used in the act.  Thus, we find that\r\nprejudgment interest is not included in the statutory cap on damages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe must next determine whether prejudgment interest is calculated on the capped\r\nor uncapped amount of damages.  The statute provides that prejudgment interest shall be\r\npaid on past damages found by the trier of fact, but not on future damages.  Past damages\r\nare defined as those awarded to compensate the claimant for their loss incurred from the\r\nperiod beginning on the date of injury and ending on the day before the date of judgment. \r\n<em>Id. </em>§ 16.02(d)(1).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees contend that, because the statutory language provides that prejudgment\r\ninterest is to be paid on damages found \"by the trier of fact,\" prejudgment interest should\r\nbe calculated on that amount awarded before application of the damages cap and cite to\r\n<em>Moore </em>in support of that proposition.  However, the court held that prejudgment interest\r\nis not included in the damages cap and is recoverable on all damages.  <em>Moore</em>, 43 S.W.3d\r\nat 562.  However, that statement was, as noted, made within the context of whether\r\nprejudgment interest was included within the cap.  Therefore, the court was merely stating\r\nthat prejudgment interest is owed, even though it exceeds the amount authorized by the\r\ndamages cap and should be paid on all damages, both those covered and not covered by\r\nthe cap, <em>i.e.</em>, medical, hospital, and custodial care.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe issue in the other two cases cited by appellees, <em>Samples v. Graham,</em> 76\r\nS.W.3d 615 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi, 2002, no pet. h.) and <em>Battaglia v. Alexander,</em> No.\r\n14-00-00428-CV, slip op., 2002 WL 730530 (Tex.App.--Houston [14<sup>th</sup> Dist.] April 25, 2002,\r\nno pet. h.), was whether prejudgment interest should be awarded on past damages found\r\nby the trier of fact prior to a deduction for settlement credits.  In both cases, the courts\r\nfound that the deduction for settlement credits should be made after calculation of\r\nprejudgment interest on the amount awarded by the jury.  However, we note that in\r\n<em>Graham</em>, the court stated that prejudgment interest is included in the statutory cap and\r\nrefused to find that \"allowing prevailing plaintiffs to recover prejudgment interest only on\r\na <span>statutorily limited measure of past damages</span> found by the jury presents an absurd\r\nscenario.\" (Emphasis added).  <em>Graham,</em> 76 S.W.3d at 621.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, we must assume the legislature intended the plain meaning of its\r\nwords and, if possible, ascertain their intent from the language used in the statute. <em>National\r\nLiability &amp; Fire</em> <em>Ins. Co. v. Allen,</em> 15 S.W.3d 525, 527 (Tex. 2000).  The legislature did not\r\nprovide that prejudgment interest is to be awarded on the amount of past damages\r\nincluded in the judgment, but on the amount awarded by the trier of fact.  This language\r\nimplies that prejudgment interest is applicable on the full amount of past damages found\r\nby the jury prior to the application of the liability cap, which determines the amount for\r\nwhich the defendant is liable in the judgment.  We therefore interpret the statute to require\r\ncalculation of prejudgment interest on the amount of damages found by the jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn light of that finding, appellants argue that appellees are limited to prejudgment\r\ninterest on the amount of damages awarded by the jury for the survival claims because\r\nappellees did not request segregation of past and future damages with respect to their\r\nwrongful death claims.  Appellants and appellees agree that the amount awarded as\r\nsurvival damages constitutes past damages.   Essentially, the only disputed issue between\r\nthe parties is which of them had the burden of requesting segregation of the wrongful\r\ndeath damages.  Appellants argue that, under the law, the burden is on the plaintiff. \r\nConversely, appellees argue that, because appellants pled the statutory limitation on\r\nprejudgment interest as an affirmative defense, they had the burden to request\r\nsegregation.      </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe statute clearly provides that prejudgment interest is not to be awarded on future\r\ndamages.  Appellees have cited no authority stating that to be entitled to the benefit of this\r\nstatute, a defendant must assert it as an affirmative defense in his pleading.  However, it\r\nhas been held that the burden of segregating past and future damages is on the party\r\nseeking to obtain prejudgment interest.  <em>Cavnar v. Quality Control Parking, Inc., </em>696\r\nS.W.2d 549, 556 (Tex. 1985); <em>Domingues v. City of San Antonio, </em>985 S.W.2d 505, 511\r\n(Tex.App.--San Antonio 1998, pet. denied).  This is so because it is fair to place the\r\nburden of submitting a proper jury charge on the party to whom the benefit of the charge\r\nwill result.  <em>Id</em>.  Because appellees did not submit a charge segregating past damages from\r\nfuture damages, no prejudgment interest is available on the wrongful death damages\r\nawarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, appellants contend with respect to prejudgment interest that the award\r\nshould be reduced for periods of delay caused by appellees.  Prejudgment interest is to\r\nbe computed in accordance with the Texas Finance Code.  <em>See </em>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat Ann.\r\n§ 16.02(c) (Vernon Supp. 1999).  Under section 304.108(a), a court may consider the\r\nperiods of delay in the trial and order that prejudgment interest does not accrue during\r\nthem.  Tex. Fin. Code Ann. § 304.108 (Vernon Supp. 2003).  However, prejudgment\r\ninterest is to be denied only for delays caused by the parties and not a crowded trial\r\ndocket.  <em>Purcell v. Const., Inc. v. Welch</em>, 17 S.W.3d 398, 403 (Tex.App.--Houston [1<sup>st</sup> Dist.]\r\n2000, no pet.).  We review a court's refusal to offset prejudgment interest under an abuse\r\nof discretion standard.  <em>Helena Chemical Co. v. Wilkins, </em>18 S.W.3d 744, 760 (Tex. App.--\r\nSan Antonio 2000), <em>aff'd, </em>47 S.W.3d 486 (Tex. 2001); <em>City of Alamo v. Casas</em>, 960 S.W.2d\r\n240, 260 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1997, pet. denied).   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants argue that the court should have granted an offset from appellees first\r\nrequest for continuance on October 1, 1998, to the date of the fifth trial setting when the\r\ncase actually went to trial on May 7, 2001.  They base this contention on their claim that\r\nappellees did not promptly pursue a speedy resolution of their claims by requesting at\r\nleast four continuances.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile this case took almost five years to come to trial, the clerk's record reveals\r\nonly three motions for continuance by appellees and only one of those motions was\r\nopposed by appellants.  If appellants felt that appellees were unnecessarily delaying the\r\ntrial, they could have been more proactive in seeking and holding appellees to a trial\r\nsetting.  It has been held not to be an abuse of discretion to refuse to make an offset\r\nagainst prejudgment interest when one motion for continuance was granted at one party's\r\nrequest, another motion for continuance was granted at the other party's request, and one\r\nwas granted pursuant to a joint motion.  <em>Aquila Southwest Pipeline, Inc. v. Harmony\r\nExploration, Inc., </em>48 S.W.3d 225, 244 (Tex.App.--San Antonio 2001, pet. denied).  Under\r\nthe record before us, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to offset\r\nprejudgment interest.  In summary, we sustained in part and overruled in part appellants'\r\nfirst issue.  In doing so, we found that the judgment should be calculated based on a single\r\nstatutory cap adjusted by the consumer price index and that prejudgment interest should\r\nbe calculated on the award of survival damages only.  We also overrule appellees' cross-issues.        </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their<em> </em>second issue, appellants argue that the judgment improperly included\r\nDenise Corbello and Lynette Calvert, as heirs at law of the Estate of Wanda Granger\r\nbecause they non-suited their claims with prejudice against appellants prior to trial. \r\nAppellees respond that Corbello and Calvert only non-suited their individual claims against\r\nappellants, not their survival claims.  Thus, they assert, because the judgment only awards\r\nthem damages as heirs at law, the judgment does not include improper plaintiffs.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCorbello and Calvert sued both on an individual basis and as heirs at law of\r\nGranger's estate.  The notice of non-suit was brought by them only in their individual\r\ncapacities.  Further, it specifically states that the non-suit \"is only being taken as to\r\nindividual claims made on the part of DENISE CORBELLO AND LYNETTE CALVERT and\r\nnot as to any claims made by the Estate of Wanda Granger.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants appear to contend that because Corbello and Calvert did not appear at\r\ntrial and no claims were submitted by them in the charge to the jury, the judgment is in\r\nerror.  However, the jury was asked what sum of money would fairly and reasonably\r\ncompensate Granger for pain and mental anguish.  This question represents the claim for\r\nsurvival damages which is the claim brought by Granger's estate.  Because the claims of\r\nCorbello and Calvert, as heirs at law of Granger's estate were not non-suited, this question\r\nrepresents their claims.  Appellants' second issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy way of their third issue, appellants contend that the trial court erred in awarding\r\njudgment against Cresthaven and the five general partners.  Appellants object to the\r\ninclusion of the general partners because no evidence was submitted to support the\r\nliability of the general partners and the jury made no finding of liability for them.  We have\r\nalready discussed this issue with respect to whether there should be a single cap on\r\ndamages.  It was because there was no assertion or finding of liability against the partners\r\nindependent of their status as general partners that we concluded that a single cap should\r\napply.  However, we also concluded that it was appropriate to include the general partners\r\nin the judgment because, under the law, they have joint and several liability for the debts\r\nof the partnership.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants argue that, in the last live pleading by appellees, they only alleged that\r\n\"the corporate partners were responsible for the management and operation of Cresthaven\r\nNursing Residence, that each of the corporate partners were general partners of Cantex\r\nHealthcare Centers, and that the corporate partners were jointly and severally liable for\r\nthe acts and omissions of the employees of Cresthaven.\"  Appellants now appear to be\r\narguing that these allegations are asserting claims against the general partners arising\r\nunder the law independent of their status as general partners and, because they filed a\r\nverified denial of these allegations and no evidence of negligence of the general partners\r\nwas submitted at trial, they are improperly included in the judgment.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs already stated, we interpret these allegations as asserting a claim against the\r\ngeneral partners based only on their status as general partners, which we believe is\r\nsupported by the fact that no evidence was introduced at trial as to their individual\r\nnegligence and no issue submitted to the jury with respect to any such negligence.  Even\r\nif the allegations included independent individual liability for which no findings were made\r\nby the jury, those facts would not obviate the statutory mandate which holds the general\r\npartners liable.  The general partners were named as parties to the lawsuit and, under the\r\nlaw, they are jointly and severally liable for the debt owed under the judgment by Cantex. \r\nThus, it is appropriate to include them in the judgment.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants have failed to present any argument or authorities as to why Cresthaven\r\nshould not be included in the judgment.  Therefore, nothing is presented for review.<sup> (4)</sup></span><span>\r\n<em>Dunlap v. Excel Corp., </em>30 S.W.3d 427, 434 (Tex.App.--Amarillo 2000, no pet.); <em>Jefferson\r\nCounty Drainage Dist. No. 6 v. Lower Neches Valley Authority</em>, 876 S.W.2d 940, 953 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Beaumont 1994, writ denied).  We overrule appellants' third issue.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their fourth issue, appellants complain of the trial court's error in submitting a\r\nspoliation instruction to the jury, which probably caused the rendition of an improper\r\njudgment.  The instruction given by the court was as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tYou are instructed that, when a party has possession of a piece of\r\nevidence at a time he knows or should have known it will be evidence in a\r\ncontroversy, and thereafter he disposes of it, alters it, makes it unavailable,\r\nor fails to produce it, there is a presumption in law that the piece of evidence,\r\nhad it been produced, would have been unfavorable to the party who did not\r\nproduce it.  If you find by a preponderance of the evidence that Cresthaven\r\nNursing Residence had possession of original, unaltered nurses notes\r\npertaining to Wanda Granger at a time it knew or should have known they\r\nwould be evidence in this controversy, then there is a presumption that the\r\noriginal, unaltered nurses notes pertaining to Wanda Granger, if produced,\r\nwould be unfavorable to Cresthaven Nursing Residence.  This presumption\r\nmay be rebutted by Cresthaven Nursing Residence with the evidence of a\r\nreasonable explanation for the non-production of the evidence.<sup> (5)</sup></span><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe doctrine of spoliation refers to the improper intentional destruction of evidence\r\nrelevant to a case.  <em>See Malone v. Foster, </em>956 S.W.2d 573, 577 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1997),\r\n<em>aff'd, </em>977 S.W.2d 562 (Tex. 1998).  Trial courts have broad discretion to take measures\r\nto correct the ill effects resulting from spoliation, including a jury instruction on the\r\nspoliation presumption and death penalty sanctions.  <em>Trevino v. Ortega</em>, 969 S.W.2d 950,\r\n953 (Tex. 1998).  In making that determination, appellants urge reliance on the factors set\r\nforth in Justice Baker's concurring opinion in <em>Trevino, </em>which are (1) whether there was a\r\nduty to preserve evidence, (2) whether the alleged spoliator negligently or intentionally\r\nspoliated evidence, and (3) whether the spoliation prejudiced the nonspoliator's ability to\r\npresent its case.  <em>Id. </em>at 954-55.  Several courts have adopted these factors in their\r\nanalysis of the propriety of an instruction. <em> See Whiteside v. Watson</em>, 12 S.W.3d 614, 621-22 (Tex. App.--Eastland 2000, pet. denied); <em>Offshore Pipelines, Inc. v. Schooley, </em>984\r\nS.W.2d 654, 667-78 (Tex.App.--Houston [1<sup>st</sup> Dist.] 1998, no pet.).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA party may have a statutory, regulatory or ethical duty to preserve evidence. \r\n<em>Trevino, </em>969 S.W.2d at 955.  A party also has a duty to preserve relevant evidence once\r\nlitigation arises, and a duty to exercise reasonable care to preserve relevant evidence if\r\nit actually or reasonably should anticipate litigation.  <em>See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.</em> <em>v. Johnson,\r\n</em>39 S.W.3d 729, 730, 732 (Tex.App.--Beaumont 2001, pet. granted).  <em> </em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence shows that Granger had been a resident of the nursing home since\r\nFebruary 1995.  On July 5, 1996, she was admitted to the hospital with a broken femur. \r\nShe returned to Cresthaven on July 8, 1996, but was readmitted to the hospital on July 19\r\nafter vomiting dried blood.  She died the next day.  On July 20, just hours prior to the death\r\nof her mother, Freeman visited the nursing home seeking information as to her mother's\r\ncondition in the days prior to her hospitalization and requested a copy of her mother's\r\nrecords. <em> </em>From this evidence, the trial court could have concluded that there was a duty\r\non the part of Cresthaven to preserve those records.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence further shows that on July 20, one of the nurses, Gloria Thompson,\r\nwas asked by Joan Adams, the assistant director of nursing, to recopy a July 19 entry in\r\nher nursing notes with respect to Granger.  The original note was apparently given to\r\nAdams, but was not available at trial.  However, Thompson testified that she recopied her\r\nnote verbatim<em> </em>and there is no evidence to the contrary.<sup> (6)</sup></span><span>  She additionally stated that\r\neverything in the note was accurate and based on her personal observations.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLate entries were also made in the records of Granger although they were not noted\r\nas such.  There is some evidence that Adams may have told Thompson and Cynthia\r\nArceneaux that the chart was not completely documented and information needed to be\r\nfilled in.   However, none of the persons making those entries testified that they provided\r\nfalse information.<sup> (7)</sup></span><span>  There was also testimony that there were times when the staff was so\r\nbusy with resident care that they did not have time to complete their records on their shift\r\nand completed them later.         </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to these acts, appellees claim that they established that (1) medical\r\nrecords are missing notes from the charge nurse for several shifts during a critical period\r\nof Granger's care, (2) intake/outflow records for the entire month of July are missing, (3)\r\nnurses were directed to fill in missing portions of the medical record, and (4) catheter care\r\nwas given by a medication aide who could not give catheter care.  However, the pages\r\ncited in the record with respect to the missing notes from the nurse only establish that one\r\nnurse, Maridel Potato Meja, and Thompson herself did not know where Thompson's notes \r\nwere, if she had in fact worked on July 16.  It does not prove that the notes ever existed\r\nor that either person was responsible for being the custodian of those records.  Further,\r\nthe evidence shows that intake/outflow sheets were not placed by Granger's bed, which\r\nis evidence that the documents never existed.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEntries in the records for July 12 through July 19 show that Granger was eating\r\n100% of her food, although nurse's aide Essex testified she was not eating much, if\r\nanything.  Freeman also stated that, although records indicate that her mother was talking\r\nand asking for food that week, from her own personal observations her mother was not\r\nresponding to questions or eating.   It is not established if these inconsistencies are the\r\nresult of false records or if there are other explanations such as differences in the time of\r\nobservation.  There is also evidence that entries in care were initially made for one or more\r\ndays when Granger was in the hospital, although some of these were later scratched out. \r\nOnce again, the record does not affirmatively establish if these incorrect records are the\r\nresult of deliberate falsification or honest mistakes.  As to catheter care, Arceneaux denied\r\nthat the initials which looked like \"C. A.\" next to catheter care were hers, and no\r\nexplanation for who performed the catheter care was provided. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKenneth Blanda, administrator of Cresthaven, testified that he had not been aware\r\nat the time it happened that any entries had been made late or recopied.  Further, there\r\nwas no directive from upper managment, he averred, for them to \"get those records\r\nstraight\" or make sure there were no blanks in the record.  He denied that the records had\r\nbeen falsified and stated that as far as he knew, they were accurate.  However, he\r\nadmitted that a notation should have been made of any late entry.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe deliberate spoliation of evidence relevant to a case raises the presumption that\r\nthe evidence would have been unfavorable to the cause of the spoliator.  <em>Ordonez v. M.\r\nW. McCurdy &amp; Co., Inc., </em>984 S.W.2d 264, 273 (Tex.App.--Houston [1<sup>st</sup> Dist.] 1998, no\r\npet.); <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Middleton</em>, 982 S.W.2d 468, 470 (Tex.App.--San Antonio\r\n1998, pet. denied); <em>Brewer v. Dowling, </em>862 S.W.2d 156, 159 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1993,\r\nwrit denied).  The presumption may be rebutted with a showing that the evidence was not\r\ndestroyed with a fraudulent intent or purpose.  <em>Hight v. Dublin Veterinary Clinic, </em>22 S.W.3d\r\n614, 619 (Tex.App.--Eastland 2000, pet. denied). The presumption does not apply when\r\ndocuments are merely lost.  <em>Williford Energy Co. v. Submergible Cable Services, Inc., </em>895\r\nS.W.2d 379, 389-90 (Tex.App.--Amarillo 1994, no pet.).     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court must submit in the charge to the jury all questions, instructions, and\r\ndefinitions raised by the pleadings and the evidence.  <em>Hyundai Motor Co. v. Rodriguez ex\r\nrel. Rodgriguez, </em>995 S.W.2d 661, 663 (Tex. 1999).  If the instruction might aid the jury in\r\nanswering the issues presented or if there is any support in the evidence for the\r\ninstruction, it is proper.  <em>Knighten v. Louisiana Pacific Corp., </em>946 S.W.2d 638, 643\r\n(Tex.App.--Beaumont 1997), <em>rev'd on other grounds, </em>976 S.W.2d 674 (Tex. 1998).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe will assume that the purported alteration of records can satisfy the requirement\r\nof destroyed evidence.  However, the evidence with respect to the rewriting of Thompson's\r\nnurse's notes for July 19 does not show that there was any false information or that any\r\nprejudice resulted to appellees as a result of the rewriting of those notes.  The same is true\r\nwith respect to any late entries made to the nursing home records except for the\r\ninconsistent testimony of Essex as to whether she was asked to make late entries for any\r\ndays that she did not actually work.  Further, the evidence as to the intake/outflow records\r\nis that they never existed, which may be evidence of negligent care, but not of spoliation\r\nof evidence.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThus, the only evidence that might raise the issue of spoliation is the inconsistent\r\ntestimony of Essex as to whether she was asked to make late entries for days that she did\r\nnot actually work, inconsistencies between nurse's records showing the patient was eating\r\nand talking in the days before her death and the testimony of a nurse's aide and the\r\npatient's daughter which stated she was not, and Thompson's notes for July 16, which may\r\nbe missing but were not shown conclusively to have actually existed. Although not\r\nparticularly strong, these facts rise to a scintilla of evidence which would support the giving\r\nof the instruction within the discretion afforded to the trial judge.  Further, if the medical\r\nrecords were altered to show that the patient was eating and talking in the days before her\r\ndeath when, in fact, she was not, that information could have constituted some evidence\r\nthat the nursing home was aware she had a bladder infection which continued to worsen,\r\nthereby resulting in her death, according to appellees' theory of the case.  Appellants'\r\nfourth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their fifth and sixth issues, appellants claim the damages awarded arising out of\r\nboth the survival claim and wrongful death claim are excessive and not supported by\r\nfactually sufficient evidence.  Therefore, they assert, they are entitled to a new trial or,\r\nalternatively, this court should suggest a remittitur of damages.                  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining whether damages are excessive, the court should use the same test\r\nas that for a factual sufficiency question.  <em>Pope v. Moore, </em>711 S.W.2d 622, 624 (Tex.\r\n1986).  Thus, we must consider and weigh all of the evidence and should set aside the\r\naward only if the challenged finding of fact is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the\r\nevidence as to be manifestly unjust.  <em>In re King's Estate, </em>150 Tex. 662, 244 S.W.2d 660,\r\n661-62 (1951).  The mere fact that an award is large does not show that the jury was\r\ninfluenced by passion, prejudice, sympathy, or other circumstances not in evidence, and\r\nthe award must be flagrantly outrageous, extravagant, and so excessive that it shocks the\r\njudicial conscience.  <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Roberson, </em>25 S.W.3d 251, 257-58 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Beaumont 2000, no pet.).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury was asked what sum of money would have fairly and reasonably\r\ncompensated Granger for pain and mental anguish, which was defined as the conscious\r\nphysical pain and emotional pain, torment, and suffering experienced by her before her\r\ndeath as a result of the occurrence in question.  The jury found that $4.5 million would so\r\ncompensate her.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Saenz v. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Ins. Underwriters, </em>925 S.W.2d 607 (Tex. 1996), it\r\nwas held that mental anguish must be \"a high degree of mental pain and distress\" and\r\nmust necessarily involve more than mere worry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or\r\nanger.  <em>Id. </em>at 614.  While juries must be afforded discretion in arriving at the determination\r\nof a figure for which there is no exact evaluation, there must be some evidence to justify\r\nthe amount awarded, and juries cannot simply pick a number.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>At the time of her admission to the nursing home, Granger suffered from Alzheimer's\r\nDisease, organic brain syndrome, decreased functional activity, diabetes, hypertension,\r\nand urinary tract infections.  During the time relevant to this lawsuit, there was testimony\r\nthat Granger suffered from pain as a result of a broken leg on July 4, 1996, prior to her\r\ndeath on July 20, 1996.  This apparently occurred as a result of two employees attempting\r\nto move her to her bed when she fell, collapsed or was dropped.<sup> (8)</sup></span><span>  The nursing home\r\nrecords show that immediately after her fall, Granger was asked if she had any problems,\r\nand she replied negatively.  However, the pain from the broken leg was described by her\r\ndaughter as \"excruciating,\" in spite of pain medication.  The pain would be exacerbated\r\nby being moved by nursing home personnel, although Freeman also complained that her\r\nmother was in pain because she would be left in one position too long.  There is further\r\nevidence that Granger may have been despondent, lacking an appetite, and producing\r\ncloudy and unpleasant smelling urine through her catheter during this time period,\r\nalthough Freeman stated that she did not notice any foul odors when she visited. \r\nAdditionally, there was some testimony from Freeman that, at one time when she asked\r\nthe staff to clean up her mother, it was discovered that her mother was lying in caked\r\nfeces.  Further, she was vomiting on July 19 prior to her admission to the hospital.  After\r\nshe had been admitted to the hospital on July 19, her daughter described her as shaking\r\nand non-responsive, although hospital records described her as alert, awake, not running\r\na temperature, and having no speech problem.  However, her condition worsened within\r\nhours after admission to the hospital, and she died, according to appellees, from sepsis\r\noccurring as a result of an untreated bladder infection.  Nevertheless, appellants\r\npresented autopsy evidence that her death was the result of coronary artery sclerosis due\r\nto a pinpoint narrowing of one of her arteries. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn examining the excessiveness of the damages awarded, the holdings in two cases\r\nout of the same court provide some guidance.  In <em>Casteel v. Crown Life Ins. Co., </em>3 S.W.3d\r\n582 (Tex.App.--Austin 1997), <em>rev'd in part on other grounds, </em>22 S.W.3d 378 (Tex. 2000),\r\nthe plaintiff was awarded $6,000,000 for past mental anguish as a result of his claim for\r\ndamages resulting from a misrepresentation of an insurance agent that the obligation to\r\npay premiums under a policy would eventually vanish.  The plaintiff testified that he lost\r\nbusiness, friends, and his reputation due to the dispute, he required psychiatric treatment\r\nand medications due to stress, he suffered short and long term memory loss, and he had\r\nattempted suicide due to depression.  His wife also testified about the effect of the dispute\r\non his life.  However, the court found that although the evidence supported a finding that\r\nhe suffered from past mental anguish, nothing in the record showed that $6,000,000 was\r\nreasonable compensation for that anguish.  <em>Id. </em>at 593. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Rehabilitation Facility at Austin, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>962 S.W.2d 151 (Tex.App.--Austin\r\n1998, no pet.),  a 71-year-old woman suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis\r\nwas being moved from a wheelchair to her hospital bed when she experienced great pain,\r\nbecame nauseous, and blacked out.  It was discovered several hours later that two bones\r\nhad been broken in her right leg.  The next day, after further complaints of pain, it was\r\ndiscovered that two bones in her left leg were also broken.  She spent two months in full\r\nleg casts.  Although she had not been able to walk prior to the incident, after the incident\r\nshe was unable to stand even with a walker and could not sit for more than 20 minutes at\r\na time.  The rest of the time she was prone and could no longer enjoy car rides with her\r\nson.  She experienced pain at the fracture sites and became depressed.  There was also\r\ntestimony that her chances of living as long as she might have were decreased.  In finding\r\nthat she had been deprived of what little hope and independence she had, the court held\r\nthat the evidence supported an award of $1,235,000 for pain, mental anguish and physical\r\nimpairment alone.  <em>Id. </em>at 155.<em> </em> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough there is evidence that Granger suffered pain between July 4 and July 20\r\nas a result of breaking a bone in her leg, she may have been depressed, lacking an\r\nappetite, and may not have been timely washed after having defecated in her bed on one\r\noccasion, there is nothing in the evidence to support an award of $4.5 million.  There is no\r\nevidence that, if indeed she was producing abnormal urine in the days preceding her\r\ndeath, she was even aware of that fact or that it caused her worry or pain.  Further,\r\nbecause such a short time occurred between the incident where her leg was broken and\r\nher sudden deterioration and death, there is no evidence as to how the broken leg might\r\nhave affected her long term physical and mental prognosis.  We do not believe the record\r\nsupports an award of $4.5 million for Granger's physical pain and mental anguish.  We\r\ntherefore suggest a remittitur in the amount of $3.5 million in that regard.  Having\r\nsustained appellants' fifth issue to that extent, if a remittitur is not voluntarily filed, then a\r\nnew trial should be granted. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury was also asked what sum of money would fairly and reasonably\r\ncompensate Freeman for her damages, if any, resulting from the death of her mother.  In\r\nmaking that decision, the jury was instructed to consider loss of companionship and\r\nsociety, meaning the loss of positive benefits flowing from the love, comfort,\r\ncompanionship, and society that she would have received from her mother if she had lived,\r\nand mental anguish, meaning the emotional pain, torment, and suffering experienced by\r\nFreeman because of the death of her mother.  The jury was allowed to consider the\r\nrelationship between Freeman and her mother, their living arrangements, any extended\r\nabsences from one another, the harmony of their relations, and their common interests and\r\nactivities.  The jury awarded $4.5 million, the same amount awarded as survival damages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFreeman offered the following testimony with respect to her feelings on the death\r\nof her mother:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  It was horrible.  I was shocked, hurt, saddened.  My kids were all upset. \r\nYou know, we loved my mama a whole lot; and she loved us.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  Did it come too quickly for you, ma'am?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  Of course.  I never dreamed, never, that my mother would go in a hospital\r\non a Friday and be dead on a Saturday.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  Do you feel a loss?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  Terribly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  And on top of that do you feel that you have been misled by this nursing\r\nhome?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  Totally.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  And let down?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  Yes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  Did you love your mother as much as any child could love a mother?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  I loved my mother with all my heart, and my kids loved my mother with all\r\ntheir hearts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  You feel like they have taken away years that you otherwise could have\r\nhad, such as a Mother's Day yesterday?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  Yes.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  And I'm sorry to be testifying for you, but I'm going to let you tell the jury\r\nsomething and that is what you feel.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  I didn't get to tell her \"goodbye.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(Weeping) My kids didn't get to tell her \"goodbye.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tWe didn't get to say those things that we needed to say.  And we\r\nlooked forward to the holidays.  We still talk about it.  We eat food, and I fix\r\ncertain kinds of things my mother liked to eat.  They would always say,\r\n\"That's grandma's - - you know, \"That's what she liked.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tWe would bring her food, and my kids enjoyed my mother.  And they\r\ntold her things that went on with the day.  She took lots of time with them. \r\nAnd they miss her, and I miss her.  And it's like every holiday we miss my\r\nmother.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tAnd the way - - and the way she died is just like - - it's horrible. \r\nNobody should have had to suffer like that, nobody.  And I hope that\r\nnobody's mother or anybody else has to suffer ever what I feel in my heart. \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThere was additional testimony that Granger had suffered from nervous breakdowns\r\nthroughout her life and that Freeman and her sister had been raised by others while her\r\nmother was in and out of hospitals.  Granger had also been unable to raise a younger half-sister.  As an adult, Freeman built a relationship with her mother.  Beginning in 1987,\r\nGranger lived in her daughter's home, but Freeman became unable to physically care for\r\nher mother's needs, particularly those related to her catheter, and placed her in the\r\nnursing home in 1995.  During her stay at the nursing home, Granger had periods of time\r\nin which her mental status was altered.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Russell v. Ramirez, </em>949 S.W.2d 480 (Tex.App.--Houston [14<sup>th</sup> Dist.] 1997, no\r\nwrit), the court found an award of $750,000 for mental anguish and loss of the\r\ncompanionship of the plaintiff's 16-year-old son to be supported by the evidence.  <em>Id. </em>at\r\n487.  In doing so, the court noted the plaintiff was a single parent and her son had lived\r\nat home at the time of his death, there was evidence that they did a lot of activities\r\ntogether such as skating, going to the mall, to movies and to Astroworld, there was a\r\nvideotape of him dancing with his mother shortly before his death, the plaintiff stayed with\r\nher son at the hospital for 12 days before he died and, even though she was advised he\r\nwould not recover, she talked to him and prayed for him, she still goes to his grave two or\r\nthree times a week to tell him she misses him, she places a memorial to him in the\r\nnewspaper every year, and she testified she has never stopped grieving for him.  <em>Id. </em>at\r\n486-87.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNo physical manifestation of mental anguish is necessary in wrongful death cases,\r\nand the issue can be submitted to the jury on the basis of the impact suggested by the\r\ncircumstances surrounding the loss.  <em>Moore v. Lillebo, </em>722 S.W.2d 683, 687-88 (Tex.\r\n1986).  From the evidence presented, a rational trier of fact could have found that, at the\r\ntime of her death, the relationship between Freeman and her mother was close, and they\r\nhad lived together happily for eight years until Freeman could no longer care for her\r\nmother who, by the time of her admission to the nursing home, had significant health\r\nproblems.  However, throughout her life, Freeman and her mother had been separated for\r\nextended periods of time, and there is little or no evidence of common interests or\r\nactivities.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe believe in this instance the amount of the award is not supported by the\r\nevidence.  We therefore sustain appellants' sixth issue and suggest a remittitur of $3\r\nmillion in that regard.  In the event the remittitur is not voluntarily made, the matter will be\r\nreversed for a new trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants complain in their eighth issue that the trial court abused its discretion in\r\nadmitting the testimony of appellees' medical expert, Dr. J. D. Britton, because he was not\r\nqualified to render an expert opinion on the issues in this case relating to urology,\r\ncardiology, and pathology.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Britton testified he was a family practitioner for approximately nine years. During\r\nthat time, he was a medical director of a nursing home in Austin for almost seven years. \r\nThen, he moved to Houston and began a residency program in occupational medicine for\r\ntwo years.  He obtained a master's degree in public health and completed his training in\r\noccupational medicine.  He has since been in private practice in occupational medicine. \r\n Dr. Britton is certified in preventive medicine with occupational medicine as a specialty\r\nand board eligible in family practice, meaning he has not taken the final exam to be\r\ncertified.  His experience in the areas of urology, cardiology, and pathology are from\r\nmedical school and his subsequent internship, as well as having treated patients with\r\nurological and cardiac problems.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith respect to the care of Granger, he testified there was evidence that she was\r\nsuffering from a bladder infection and that the nursing home staff had failed to give her\r\nantibiotics, even though they had been prescribed, which was negligence.  She was known\r\nto have frequent urinary infections, had been treated with antibiotics for over a year and\r\nwhen the antibiotics ceased, she still had a \"smoldering infection.\"  He further stated that\r\nweakness resulting from her infection would have contributed to her fall, resulting in a\r\nbroken leg.  When Granger was admitted to the hospital with her broken leg, her white cell\r\ncount indicated an infection, which was untreated from July 1 through July 20.  On\r\nadmission to the hospital on July 19, her white cell count also indicated a severe infection. \r\nIn the emergency room on July 19, she was diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, but\r\nlater in intensive care, a nurse reported that there was pus coming out of her bladder. \r\nThere were also dark clots of urine which would indicate the urinary tract was bleeding. \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Dr. Britton, this infection entered into Granger's bloodstream and\r\nsepsis resulted in her death.  He further opined that sepsis can shut down any vital organ\r\nincluding the heart, resulting in sudden heart failure.  Also, the stress of infection and the\r\npain of a broken leg could have caused heart failure.  The fact that she had no\r\ntemperature is not indicative that she had no infection, because the elderly can have\r\nsubnormal or normal temperature when they have an infection, and a severe infection can\r\ncause intestinal bleeding. He further stated that as of 11:00 p.m. on July 19, the\r\ninformation available, including the fact she was elderly with gastrointestinal bleeding, a\r\nwhite cell count of 27,000, IV fluids needing to be administered, her blood pressure\r\ndropping and increased pulse and respiratory rates, indicated she was septic.  By the time\r\nantibiotics were given, it was too late.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Britton, Granger had three kinds of bacteria that are common in\r\npersons with catheters for a long period of time.  The bacteria are easily treated if done\r\nso promptly.  If the hospital had received accurate records as to the nature of Granger's\r\nurine, her lack of input and output, and her non-responsiveness prior to admission to the\r\nhospital, proper treatment could have saved her life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Britton found it to be a breach of the standard of care for a nurse to not follow\r\nup on an order for an antibiotic, thereby discontinuing its use and that was a proximate\r\ncause of injury.  Further, the nursing home was grossly negligent, in his opinion, in their\r\nawareness of certain problems about which nothing was done, such as having no\r\nintake/outflow records.  The failure of the nursing home to communicate Granger's\r\nproblems to the hospital was reasonably certain to have caused her death.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a medical malpractice case, the plaintiff must establish a duty requiring the\r\ndefendants to conform to a certain standard of conduct, the applicable standard of care\r\nand its breach, a resulting injury, and a reasonably close causal connection between the\r\nbreach of the standard of care and the injury.  <em>Blan v. Ali, </em>7 S.W.3d 741, 744 (Tex. App.--\r\nHouston [14<sup>th</sup> Dist.] 1999, no pet.).  Expert testimony is necessary to meet this burden.  <em>Id. \r\n</em>An expert qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify as\r\nto scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge if it will assist the trier of fact to\r\nunderstand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.  Tex. R. Evid. 702.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHowever, every licensed doctor is not automatically qualified to testify as an expert\r\non every medical question.  <em>Broders v. Heise, </em>924 S.W.2d 148, 152 (Tex. 1996). \r\nNevertheless, the fact that an expert is not a specialist in the particular branch of medicine\r\nfor which the testimony is offered will not automatically disqualify him as an expert.  <em> Ali</em>,\r\n7 S.W.3d at 745.  The question to be resolved is the specific subject matter and the\r\nexpert's familiarity with it.  <em>See Heise</em>, 924 S.W.2d at 153; <em>Ali, </em>7 S.W.3d at 745.   The\r\nproponent of the expert bears the burden of showing that the expert's testimony is\r\nqualified, relevant to the issues, based on a reliable foundation, and will assist the trier of\r\nfact.  <em>E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc. v. Robinson, </em>923 S.W.2d 549, 556 (Tex.\r\n1995).  We review the ruling of the trial court as to the qualifications of an expert witness\r\nunder an abuse of discretion standard.  <em>Heise, </em>924 S.W.2d at 151.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants complain that Dr. Britton was not qualified by education, training,\r\nknowledge, or experience in the fields of urology, cardiology, or pathology, which would\r\nqualify him to make a diagnosis of sepsis or urosepsis or to render opinions that the same\r\nwere the proximate cause of Granger's broken leg, heart failure, and/or death.  This is\r\nprimarily so because his only training or experience in those fields occurred in medical\r\nschool or in his practice of family medicine, which ended in 1984.  Therefore, his opinions\r\nwere mere speculation. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe focus of our determination is not on the doctor's area of expertise, but on the\r\ncondition involved in the claim.  <em>Ali</em>, 7 S.W.3d at 746.  If Dr. Britton is offering opinions\r\npeculiar only to the fields of urology, cardiology, and pathology, then he is unqualified to\r\nrender them.  However, if the standards of care he discusses apply to any physician or\r\nhealth care provider who treats an elderly patient with long term catheter care and\r\ncardiology problems, then his lack of expertise in those special fields is irrelevant.  <em>See id.\r\n</em>at 747.    \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Britton's opinions as to the negligence of the nursing home involved the failure\r\nto give an antibiotic that had been prescribed for a urinary tract infection, to maintain\r\naccurate information in nursing home records and to communicate that information to\r\nhospital personnel upon transfer of a patient to the hospital.  The standard of care with\r\nrespect to these actions are common to all patients in a nursing home and, further, Dr.\r\nBritton had experience as a nursing home director.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs to the cause of death, Dr. Britton relied on his medical training and general\r\nexperience treating patients.  He further researched reference articles with respect to\r\nsepsis and the conditions which indicate its manifestation and also an article on\r\nprecipitating causes of heart failure.  Moreover, one of the consulting hospital physicians\r\nfor Granger on June 20, a cardiologist, gave his impression of her condition as\r\n\"hypotension and shock, probably secondary to sepsis, probably urosepsis and urinary\r\ntract infection.\"  Additionally, her attending physician at the time of her death, a doctor of\r\nosteopathy, listed one of the causes of death on her death certificate as sepsis.<sup> (9)</sup></span><span>   Thus,\r\nthere is nothing to indicate that the opinions offered required an expertise peculiar to the\r\nfields of cardiology or urology.  Further, multiple doctors who are not pathologists offered\r\nopinions as to the cause of Granger's death. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nallowing Dr. Britton to testify.  Appellants' seventh issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their eighth issue, appellants argue that because Dr. Britton's testimony was not\r\ncompetent, the record contains no evidence to establish the standard of care, breach of\r\nthat standard, or proximate causation.  However, we have found Dr. Britton's testimony to\r\nhave been admissible, and thus there was some evidence on all three elements of\r\nappellees' claims.  It was up to the jury to assign whatever credibility they chose to that\r\ntestimony.  We therefore also overrule appellants' eighth issue. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSummarized, we overrule appellants' second, third, fourth, seventh and eighth\r\nissues and appellees' two cross-issues.  We sustain in part appellants' first issue by\r\nfinding that the damages should be limited to a single statutory cap.  Prejudgment interest\r\nis not subject to the cap and should be computed on the amount of survival damages\r\nalone.  We also sustain appellants' fifth and sixth issues.  If the suggested remittiturs are\r\nnot voluntarily made within a period of 45 days from the date of this opinion, this cause will\r\nbe reversed and remanded for a new trial.   If the remittiturs are made within that time, the\r\ncause will be affirmed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn T.

A\r\njury found that Cresthaven negligently caused injury and death to Granger and awarded\r\n$4.5 million in survival damages and $4.5 million in wrongful death damages.  There was\r\nno finding of gross negligence.  The court signed a judgment awarding all three appellants\r\n$6,051,259.20 in damages jointly and severally from Cresthaven, Cantex, and the five\r\ngeneral partners of Cantex.  That judgment has resulted in this appeal by all parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn eight issues, appellants claim (1) the judgment erroneously awarded damages\r\nexceeding the statutory limit on civil liability in section 11.01(a) of article 4590i of the\r\nTexas Revised Civil Statutes; (2) the judgment erroneously awarded damages to Lynette\r\nCalvert and Denise Corbello, who had non-suited with prejudice all their claims against\r\nappellants; (3) the judgment erroneously awarded damages against Cresthaven and the\r\nfive general partners of Cantex because there was no evidence presented of their liability\r\nand there were no affirmative jury findings of liability against them; (4) the trial court erred\r\nin submitting a spoliation instruction in the jury charge because the three elements of a\r\nspoliation complaint were not established and Cresthaven rebutted the spoliation\r\npresumption with a reasonable explanation; (5) the damages awarded for the survival\r\naction are excessive and not supported by factually sufficient evidence; (6) the damages\r\nawarded for the wrongful death action are excessive and not supported by factually\r\nsufficient evidence; (7) the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of appellees' medical\r\nexpert because he was not qualified to render expert medical opinions on the issues in this\r\ncase; and (8) there is no evidence to establish the standard of care, breach of the standard\r\nand proximate causation.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees, as cross-appellants, contend that (1) the benefits of article 4590i do not\r\nextend to general partners who have admitted they are not health care providers; and (2)\r\neven if article 4590i is applicable to the general partners, the damage cap amount should\r\nby multiplied by the number of defendants, which would include the general partners. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis lawsuit was brought as a health care liability claim under the Medical Liability\r\nand Insurance Improvement Act, article 4590i of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes.  Under\r\nthat statute, there is a cap on damages recoverable from a health care provider. \r\nSpecifically, the statute provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(a) In an action on a health care liability claim where final judgment is\r\nrendered against a physician or health care provider, the limit of civil liability\r\nfor damages of the physician or health care provider shall be limited to an\r\namount not to exceed $500,000.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i § 11.02 (a) (Vernon Supp. 1999).  The cap is further\r\nsubject to a consumer price index adjustment.  <em>Id. </em>§ 11.04.  The cap applies to both\r\nwrongful death and survival actions.  <em>Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v. Auld</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1449946\"><a href=\"/opinion/1449946/horizoncms-healthcare-corporation-v-auld/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">887</span></a></span>, 902 (Tex. 2000); <em>Rose v.

It is the\r\ninterpretation of this provision and its applicability to the judgment in this lawsuit that is the\r\nsubject of dispute between the parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants allege in their first issue that the trial court awarded damages that\r\nexceeded the civil liability cap.  They contend that the trial court should have limited\r\ndamages to one cap, including prejudgment interest computed at the time the judgment\r\nwas signed or $1,413,008.13.  Alternatively, if prejudgment interest is not appropriately\r\nincluded in the liability cap, the judgment should have included prejudgment interest\r\ncomputed on the amount of capped damages, the judgment should not have included\r\nprejudgment interest on the wrongful death damages, and accrual of prejudgment interest\r\nshould have been tolled by lengthy periods of delay caused by appellees.  The cross-issues of appellees are related to these arguments, and we will address them in our\r\ndiscussion of these matters.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants initially argue that, because the liability of only one defendant,\r\nCresthaven, was submitted to the jury, the judgment is limited to a single cap.  It has been\r\nheld that the damages provision is to be applied on a \"per defendant\" basis.  <em>Rose, </em>801\r\nS.W.2d at 847.   Thus, a plaintiff who recovers against more than one defendant may\r\nobtain a judgment in excess of the cap as long as the combined statutory liability of all\r\ndefendants is not exceeded.  <em>Id.  </em>Further, the cap applicable to a single defendant who is\r\njointly and severally liable in a comparative negligence situation is not increased by the\r\nnumber of culpable defendants.  <em>Columbia Hosp. Corp. of Houston v. Moore, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1382994\"><a href=\"/opinion/1382994/columbia-hosp-corp-of-houston-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 556 (Tex.App.--Houston [1<sup>st</sup> Dist.] 2001, pet. granted).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConversely, appellees argue in response to this issue and also in their first cross-issue that, because the five general partners of the owner and operator of the nursing\r\nhome have admitted they are not health care providers, they are not entitled to the\r\nprotection of the cap.  Alternatively, even if the cap is available to all of the defendants,\r\nthere are six culpable defendants against whom the court has rendered judgment, and\r\ntherefore the cap should be multiplied by six.  This is so, appellees posit, because it is not\r\nnecessary for the defendant to have been found liable by a jury for a defendant to be\r\nculpable pursuant to the judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOnly the issue of Cresthaven's negligence was submitted to the jury.  However, the\r\njudgment recites that appellees may recover jointly and severally from Cresthaven, Cantex,\r\nand the five general partners of Cantex.  While appellees assert that Cantex is liable\r\nbecause it is the owner and operator of Cresthaven, they do not contend that both Cantex\r\nand Cresthaven are culpable defendants, even though the jury found Cresthaven to be\r\nnegligent and judgment was rendered against both parties.  Therefore, appellees \r\napparently recognize that Cresthaven and Cantex are not two separate legal entities, and\r\nCantex is responsible for the liabilities of Cresthaven because Cantex did business as\r\nCresthaven. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs noted, appellees did not seek recovery against the general partners in their\r\npleadings as joint tortfeasors, and no issue as to the negligence of the general partners\r\nwas submitted to the jury.  Therefore, even if the general partners have judicially admitted\r\nthat they are not health care providers, as appellees contend, it is irrelevant since\r\nappellees did not seek damages from the general partners on the basis that they were\r\nhealth care providers.  The basis upon which appellees sought damages against the\r\ngeneral partners, and upon which the judgment against them was entered, is that statutory\r\nlaw imposes joint and several liability on general partners for the debts and obligations of\r\na partnership making them vicariously liable.  Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6132b-3.04.\r\nVicarious liability is a judicially created vehicle for enforcing remedies for wrongs.  <em>Dutcher\r\nv. Owens, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1782746\"><a href=\"/opinion/1782746/dutcher-v-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>, 950-51 (Tex. 1983).  It is the imposition of liability on one party\r\nfor the actionable conduct of another based on a relationship between the parties.  Black's\r\nLaw Dictionary 1566 (6<sup>th</sup> ed. 1990).  No liability under the law was imposed on the general\r\npartners independent of their status as a partner.  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTherefore, the general partners can only be liable for the debt incurred by Cantex\r\nd/b/a Cresthaven.  It is appropriate to include them in the judgment, but not to increase the\r\namount of the judgment by treating each general partner as a tortfeasor in its own right. \r\nWe believe this interpretation is consistent with the stated purposes of the Medical Liability\r\nand Insurance Improvement Act, one of which is to decrease the cost of claims and assure\r\nthat awards are rationally related to actual damages.  <em>See </em>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art.\r\n4590i § 1.02(b)(2) (Vernon Supp. 1999).  Otherwise, the amount of an award against a\r\nhealth care provider could be doubled simply by the fact it has four general partners\r\ninstead of two.  Thus, the judgment is limited by a single cap of $500,000 adjusted by the\r\nconsumer price index. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants also contend that prejudgment interest is included within the section\r\n11.02 cap on damages.  This question has not been definitively answered by the Texas\r\nSupreme Court.  In <em>Auld,</em> the court concluded that prejudgment interest under the general\r\nprejudgment interest statute<sup> (3)</sup></span><span> was included in the damages cap.  <em>Auld, </em>34 S.W.3d at 900-01.  However, the majority opinion specifically declined to address whether sections 16.01\r\nand 16.02 of article 4590i, added in 1995, conflict with this interpretation.  Pursuant to\r\nsection 16.02, judgments must include prejudgment interest on past damages found by the\r\ntrier of fact, but are not to include prejudgment interest on future damages.  Tex. Rev. Civ.\r\nStat. Ann. art. 4590i § 16.02(b) (Vernon Supp. 1999).  Nevertheless, in a concurring and\r\ndissenting opinion, four justices indicated their belief that this section confirms that\r\nprejudgment interest is not subject to the cap.  <em>Auld</em>, 34 S.W.3d at 908.  More recently, the\r\nHouston Court of Appeals ruled that the majority opinion in <em>Auld </em>with respect to\r\nprejudgment interest under the general statute was not binding when prejudgment interest\r\nwas awarded under the more recent provisions of the Medical Liability and Insurance\r\nImprovement Act, which shows a legislative intent to exclude prejudgment interest from the\r\ncap.  <em>Moore, </em>43 S.W.3d at 562.     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe agree with the Houston court that the holding in <em>Auld </em>is not binding, and we\r\nmust determine the effect of the legislature having added Subchapter P dealing with\r\nprejudgment interest to the act and reconcile it with the liability limits in Subchapter K.  We\r\nnote initially that section 11.02 of Subchapter K states that where final judgment is\r\nrendered against a physician or health care provider, \"the limit of civil liability for damages\r\nof the physician or health care provider shall be limited to an amount not to exceed\r\n$500,000.\"  Thus, the cap applies to damages, not the amount of the judgment.  Further,\r\nthe cap does not include the amount of damages awarded on claims for necessary\r\nmedical, hospital, and custodial care.  Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. § 11.02(b) (Vernon Supp.\r\n1999).  However, in Subchapter P, section 16.02 provides that the <span>judgment</span> must include\r\nprejudgment interest on past damages, but shall not include prejudgment interest on future\r\ndamages.  <em>Id. </em>§ 16.02(b).  Thus, it seems clear that the legislature intended to make a\r\ndistinction between damages awarded and the final judgment by providing that the cap\r\napplies to the damages awarded, but prejudgment interest on past damages must be\r\nincluded in the judgment.  Further, if the legislature had intended the cap to apply to\r\nprejudgment interest, it would surely have made that provision.  We believe this is a logical\r\ninterpretation of the act relying on the language used in the act.  Thus, we find that\r\nprejudgment interest is not included in the statutory cap on damages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe must next determine whether prejudgment interest is calculated on the capped\r\nor uncapped amount of damages.  The statute provides that prejudgment interest shall be\r\npaid on past damages found by the trier of fact, but not on future damages.  Past damages\r\nare defined as those awarded to compensate the claimant for their loss incurred from the\r\nperiod beginning on the date of injury and ending on the day before the date of judgment. \r\n<em>Id. </em>§ 16.02(d)(1).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees contend that, because the statutory language provides that prejudgment\r\ninterest is to be paid on damages found \"by the trier of fact,\" prejudgment interest should\r\nbe calculated on that amount awarded before application of the damages cap and cite to\r\n<em>Moore </em>in support of that proposition.  However, the court held that prejudgment interest\r\nis not included in the damages cap and is recoverable on all damages.  <em>Moore</em>, 43 S.W.3d\r\nat 562.  However, that statement was, as noted, made within the context of whether\r\nprejudgment interest was included within the cap.  Therefore, the court was merely stating\r\nthat prejudgment interest is owed, even though it exceeds the amount authorized by the\r\ndamages cap and should be paid on all damages, both those covered and not covered by\r\nthe cap, <em>i.e.</em>, medical, hospital, and custodial care.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe issue in the other two cases cited by appellees, <em>Samples v. Graham,</em> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335315\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335315/samples-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span> (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi, 2002, no pet. h.) and <em>Battaglia v.

In both cases, the courts\r\nfound that the deduction for settlement credits should be made after calculation of\r\nprejudgment interest on the amount awarded by the jury.  However, we note that in\r\n<em>Graham</em>, the court stated that prejudgment interest is included in the statutory cap and\r\nrefused to find that \"allowing prevailing plaintiffs to recover prejudgment interest only on\r\na <span>statutorily limited measure of past damages</span> found by the jury presents an absurd\r\nscenario.\" (Emphasis added).  <em>Graham,</em> 76 S.W.3d at 621.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, we must assume the legislature intended the plain meaning of its\r\nwords and, if possible, ascertain their intent from the language used in the statute. <em>National\r\nLiability &amp; Fire</em> <em>Ins. Co. v. Allen,</em> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2107112\"><a href=\"/opinion/2107112/national-liability-and-fire-ins-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 527 (Tex. 2000).  The legislature did not\r\nprovide that prejudgment interest is to be awarded on the amount of past damages\r\nincluded in the judgment, but on the amount awarded by the trier of fact.  This language\r\nimplies that prejudgment interest is applicable on the full amount of past damages found\r\nby the jury prior to the application of the liability cap, which determines the amount for\r\nwhich the defendant is liable in the judgment.  We therefore interpret the statute to require\r\ncalculation of prejudgment interest on the amount of damages found by the jury.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn light of that finding, appellants argue that appellees are limited to prejudgment\r\ninterest on the amount of damages awarded by the jury for the survival claims because\r\nappellees did not request segregation of past and future damages with respect to their\r\nwrongful death claims.  Appellants and appellees agree that the amount awarded as\r\nsurvival damages constitutes past damages.   Essentially, the only disputed issue between\r\nthe parties is which of them had the burden of requesting segregation of the wrongful\r\ndeath damages.  Appellants argue that, under the law, the burden is on the plaintiff. \r\nConversely, appellees argue that, because appellants pled the statutory limitation on\r\nprejudgment interest as an affirmative defense, they had the burden to request\r\nsegregation.      </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe statute clearly provides that prejudgment interest is not to be awarded on future\r\ndamages.  Appellees have cited no authority stating that to be entitled to the benefit of this\r\nstatute, a defendant must assert it as an affirmative defense in his pleading.  However, it\r\nhas been held that the burden of segregating past and future damages is on the party\r\nseeking to obtain prejudgment interest.  <em>Cavnar v. Quality Control Parking, Inc., </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403455\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403455/cavnar-v-quality-control-parking-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">696</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 556 (Tex. 1985); <em>Domingues v.

This is so because it is fair to place the\r\nburden of submitting a proper jury charge on the party to whom the benefit of the charge\r\nwill result.  <em>Id</em>.  Because appellees did not submit a charge segregating past damages from\r\nfuture damages, no prejudgment interest is available on the wrongful death damages\r\nawarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, appellants contend with respect to prejudgment interest that the award\r\nshould be reduced for periods of delay caused by appellees.  Prejudgment interest is to\r\nbe computed in accordance with the Texas Finance Code.  <em>See </em>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat Ann.\r\n§ 16.02(c) (Vernon Supp. 1999).  Under section 304.108(a), a court may consider the\r\nperiods of delay in the trial and order that prejudgment interest does not accrue during\r\nthem.  Tex. Fin. Code Ann. § 304.108 (Vernon Supp. 2003).  However, prejudgment\r\ninterest is to be denied only for delays caused by the parties and not a crowded trial\r\ndocket.  <em>Purcell v. Const., Inc. v.

They base this contention on their claim that\r\nappellees did not promptly pursue a speedy resolution of their claims by requesting at\r\nleast four continuances.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile this case took almost five years to come to trial, the clerk's record reveals\r\nonly three motions for continuance by appellees and only one of those motions was\r\nopposed by appellants.  If appellants felt that appellees were unnecessarily delaying the\r\ntrial, they could have been more proactive in seeking and holding appellees to a trial\r\nsetting.  It has been held not to be an abuse of discretion to refuse to make an offset\r\nagainst prejudgment interest when one motion for continuance was granted at one party's\r\nrequest, another motion for continuance was granted at the other party's request, and one\r\nwas granted pursuant to a joint motion.  <em>Aquila Southwest Pipeline, Inc. v.

Under\r\nthe record before us, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to offset\r\nprejudgment interest.  In summary, we sustained in part and overruled in part appellants'\r\nfirst issue.  In doing so, we found that the judgment should be calculated based on a single\r\nstatutory cap adjusted by the consumer price index and that prejudgment interest should\r\nbe calculated on the award of survival damages only.  We also overrule appellees' cross-issues.        </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their<em> </em>second issue, appellants argue that the judgment improperly included\r\nDenise Corbello and Lynette Calvert, as heirs at law of the Estate of Wanda Granger\r\nbecause they non-suited their claims with prejudice against appellants prior to trial. \r\nAppellees respond that Corbello and Calvert only non-suited their individual claims against\r\nappellants, not their survival claims.  Thus, they assert, because the judgment only awards\r\nthem damages as heirs at law, the judgment does not include improper plaintiffs.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCorbello and Calvert sued both on an individual basis and as heirs at law of\r\nGranger's estate.  The notice of non-suit was brought by them only in their individual\r\ncapacities.  Further, it specifically states that the non-suit \"is only being taken as to\r\nindividual claims made on the part of DENISE CORBELLO AND LYNETTE CALVERT and\r\nnot as to any claims made by the Estate of Wanda Granger.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants appear to contend that because Corbello and Calvert did not appear at\r\ntrial and no claims were submitted by them in the charge to the jury, the judgment is in\r\nerror.  However, the jury was asked what sum of money would fairly and reasonably\r\ncompensate Granger for pain and mental anguish.  This question represents the claim for\r\nsurvival damages which is the claim brought by Granger's estate.  Because the claims of\r\nCorbello and Calvert, as heirs at law of Granger's estate were not non-suited, this question\r\nrepresents their claims.  Appellants' second issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy way of their third issue, appellants contend that the trial court erred in awarding\r\njudgment against Cresthaven and the five general partners.  Appellants object to the\r\ninclusion of the general partners because no evidence was submitted to support the\r\nliability of the general partners and the jury made no finding of liability for them.  We have\r\nalready discussed this issue with respect to whether there should be a single cap on\r\ndamages.  It was because there was no assertion or finding of liability against the partners\r\nindependent of their status as general partners that we concluded that a single cap should\r\napply.  However, we also concluded that it was appropriate to include the general partners\r\nin the judgment because, under the law, they have joint and several liability for the debts\r\nof the partnership.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants argue that, in the last live pleading by appellees, they only alleged that\r\n\"the corporate partners were responsible for the management and operation of Cresthaven\r\nNursing Residence, that each of the corporate partners were general partners of Cantex\r\nHealthcare Centers, and that the corporate partners were jointly and severally liable for\r\nthe acts and omissions of the employees of Cresthaven.\"  Appellants now appear to be\r\narguing that these allegations are asserting claims against the general partners arising\r\nunder the law independent of their status as general partners and, because they filed a\r\nverified denial of these allegations and no evidence of negligence of the general partners\r\nwas submitted at trial, they are improperly included in the judgment.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs already stated, we interpret these allegations as asserting a claim against the\r\ngeneral partners based only on their status as general partners, which we believe is\r\nsupported by the fact that no evidence was introduced at trial as to their individual\r\nnegligence and no issue submitted to the jury with respect to any such negligence.  Even\r\nif the allegations included independent individual liability for which no findings were made\r\nby the jury, those facts would not obviate the statutory mandate which holds the general\r\npartners liable.  The general partners were named as parties to the lawsuit and, under the\r\nlaw, they are jointly and severally liable for the debt owed under the judgment by Cantex. \r\nThus, it is appropriate to include them in the judgment.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants have failed to present any argument or authorities as to why Cresthaven\r\nshould not be included in the judgment.  Therefore, nothing is presented for review.<sup> (4)</sup></span><span>\r\n<em>Dunlap v.

We overrule appellants' third issue.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their fourth issue, appellants complain of the trial court's error in submitting a\r\nspoliation instruction to the jury, which probably caused the rendition of an improper\r\njudgment.  The instruction given by the court was as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tYou are instructed that, when a party has possession of a piece of\r\nevidence at a time he knows or should have known it will be evidence in a\r\ncontroversy, and thereafter he disposes of it, alters it, makes it unavailable,\r\nor fails to produce it, there is a presumption in law that the piece of evidence,\r\nhad it been produced, would have been unfavorable to the party who did not\r\nproduce it.  If you find by a preponderance of the evidence that Cresthaven\r\nNursing Residence had possession of original, unaltered nurses notes\r\npertaining to Wanda Granger at a time it knew or should have known they\r\nwould be evidence in this controversy, then there is a presumption that the\r\noriginal, unaltered nurses notes pertaining to Wanda Granger, if produced,\r\nwould be unfavorable to Cresthaven Nursing Residence.  This presumption\r\nmay be rebutted by Cresthaven Nursing Residence with the evidence of a\r\nreasonable explanation for the non-production of the evidence.<sup> (5)</sup></span><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe doctrine of spoliation refers to the improper intentional destruction of evidence\r\nrelevant to a case.  <em>See Malone v.

On July 5, 1996, she was admitted to the hospital with a broken femur. \r\nShe returned to Cresthaven on July 8, 1996, but was readmitted to the hospital on July 19\r\nafter vomiting dried blood.  She died the next day.  On July 20, just hours prior to the death\r\nof her mother, Freeman visited the nursing home seeking information as to her mother's\r\ncondition in the days prior to her hospitalization and requested a copy of her mother's\r\nrecords. <em> </em>From this evidence, the trial court could have concluded that there was a duty\r\non the part of Cresthaven to preserve those records.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence further shows that on July 20, one of the nurses, Gloria Thompson,\r\nwas asked by Joan Adams, the assistant director of nursing, to recopy a July 19 entry in\r\nher nursing notes with respect to Granger.  The original note was apparently given to\r\nAdams, but was not available at trial.  However, Thompson testified that she recopied her\r\nnote verbatim<em> </em>and there is no evidence to the contrary.<sup> (6)</sup></span><span>  She additionally stated that\r\neverything in the note was accurate and based on her personal observations.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLate entries were also made in the records of Granger although they were not noted\r\nas such.  There is some evidence that Adams may have told Thompson and Cynthia\r\nArceneaux that the chart was not completely documented and information needed to be\r\nfilled in.   However, none of the persons making those entries testified that they provided\r\nfalse information.<sup> (7)</sup></span><span>  There was also testimony that there were times when the staff was so\r\nbusy with resident care that they did not have time to complete their records on their shift\r\nand completed them later.         </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to these acts, appellees claim that they established that (1) medical\r\nrecords are missing notes from the charge nurse for several shifts during a critical period\r\nof Granger's care, (2) intake/outflow records for the entire month of July are missing, (3)\r\nnurses were directed to fill in missing portions of the medical record, and (4) catheter care\r\nwas given by a medication aide who could not give catheter care.  However, the pages\r\ncited in the record with respect to the missing notes from the nurse only establish that one\r\nnurse, Maridel Potato Meja, and Thompson herself did not know where Thompson's notes \r\nwere, if she had in fact worked on July 16.  It does not prove that the notes ever existed\r\nor that either person was responsible for being the custodian of those records.  Further,\r\nthe evidence shows that intake/outflow sheets were not placed by Granger's bed, which\r\nis evidence that the documents never existed.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEntries in the records for July 12 through July 19 show that Granger was eating\r\n100% of her food, although nurse's aide Essex testified she was not eating much, if\r\nanything.  Freeman also stated that, although records indicate that her mother was talking\r\nand asking for food that week, from her own personal observations her mother was not\r\nresponding to questions or eating.   It is not established if these inconsistencies are the\r\nresult of false records or if there are other explanations such as differences in the time of\r\nobservation.  There is also evidence that entries in care were initially made for one or more\r\ndays when Granger was in the hospital, although some of these were later scratched out. \r\nOnce again, the record does not affirmatively establish if these incorrect records are the\r\nresult of deliberate falsification or honest mistakes.  As to catheter care, Arceneaux denied\r\nthat the initials which looked like \"C. A.\" next to catheter care were hers, and no\r\nexplanation for who performed the catheter care was provided. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tKenneth Blanda, administrator of Cresthaven, testified that he had not been aware\r\nat the time it happened that any entries had been made late or recopied.  Further, there\r\nwas no directive from upper managment, he averred, for them to \"get those records\r\nstraight\" or make sure there were no blanks in the record.  He denied that the records had\r\nbeen falsified and stated that as far as he knew, they were accurate.  However, he\r\nadmitted that a notation should have been made of any late entry.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe deliberate spoliation of evidence relevant to a case raises the presumption that\r\nthe evidence would have been unfavorable to the cause of the spoliator.  <em>Ordonez v.

However, the evidence with respect to the rewriting of Thompson's\r\nnurse's notes for July 19 does not show that there was any false information or that any\r\nprejudice resulted to appellees as a result of the rewriting of those notes.  The same is true\r\nwith respect to any late entries made to the nursing home records except for the\r\ninconsistent testimony of Essex as to whether she was asked to make late entries for any\r\ndays that she did not actually work.  Further, the evidence as to the intake/outflow records\r\nis that they never existed, which may be evidence of negligent care, but not of spoliation\r\nof evidence.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThus, the only evidence that might raise the issue of spoliation is the inconsistent\r\ntestimony of Essex as to whether she was asked to make late entries for days that she did\r\nnot actually work, inconsistencies between nurse's records showing the patient was eating\r\nand talking in the days before her death and the testimony of a nurse's aide and the\r\npatient's daughter which stated she was not, and Thompson's notes for July 16, which may\r\nbe missing but were not shown conclusively to have actually existed. Although not\r\nparticularly strong, these facts rise to a scintilla of evidence which would support the giving\r\nof the instruction within the discretion afforded to the trial judge.  Further, if the medical\r\nrecords were altered to show that the patient was eating and talking in the days before her\r\ndeath when, in fact, she was not, that information could have constituted some evidence\r\nthat the nursing home was aware she had a bladder infection which continued to worsen,\r\nthereby resulting in her death, according to appellees' theory of the case.  Appellants'\r\nfourth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their fifth and sixth issues, appellants claim the damages awarded arising out of\r\nboth the survival claim and wrongful death claim are excessive and not supported by\r\nfactually sufficient evidence.  Therefore, they assert, they are entitled to a new trial or,\r\nalternatively, this court should suggest a remittitur of damages.                  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining whether damages are excessive, the court should use the same test\r\nas that for a factual sufficiency question.  <em>Pope v.

Thus, we must consider and weigh all of the evidence and should set aside the\r\naward only if the challenged finding of fact is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the\r\nevidence as to be manifestly unjust.  <em>In re King's Estate, </em><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1670188\"><a href=\"/opinion/1670188/in-re-kings-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>,\r\n661-62 (1951).

While juries must be afforded discretion in arriving at the determination\r\nof a figure for which there is no exact evaluation, there must be some evidence to justify\r\nthe amount awarded, and juries cannot simply pick a number.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>At the time of her admission to the nursing home, Granger suffered from Alzheimer's\r\nDisease, organic brain syndrome, decreased functional activity, diabetes, hypertension,\r\nand urinary tract infections.  During the time relevant to this lawsuit, there was testimony\r\nthat Granger suffered from pain as a result of a broken leg on July 4, 1996, prior to her\r\ndeath on July 20, 1996.  This apparently occurred as a result of two employees attempting\r\nto move her to her bed when she fell, collapsed or was dropped.<sup> (8)</sup></span><span>  The nursing home\r\nrecords show that immediately after her fall, Granger was asked if she had any problems,\r\nand she replied negatively.  However, the pain from the broken leg was described by her\r\ndaughter as \"excruciating,\" in spite of pain medication.  The pain would be exacerbated\r\nby being moved by nursing home personnel, although Freeman also complained that her\r\nmother was in pain because she would be left in one position too long.  There is further\r\nevidence that Granger may have been despondent, lacking an appetite, and producing\r\ncloudy and unpleasant smelling urine through her catheter during this time period,\r\nalthough Freeman stated that she did not notice any foul odors when she visited. \r\nAdditionally, there was some testimony from Freeman that, at one time when she asked\r\nthe staff to clean up her mother, it was discovered that her mother was lying in caked\r\nfeces.  Further, she was vomiting on July 19 prior to her admission to the hospital.  After\r\nshe had been admitted to the hospital on July 19, her daughter described her as shaking\r\nand non-responsive, although hospital records described her as alert, awake, not running\r\na temperature, and having no speech problem.  However, her condition worsened within\r\nhours after admission to the hospital, and she died, according to appellees, from sepsis\r\noccurring as a result of an untreated bladder infection.  Nevertheless, appellants\r\npresented autopsy evidence that her death was the result of coronary artery sclerosis due\r\nto a pinpoint narrowing of one of her arteries. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn examining the excessiveness of the damages awarded, the holdings in two cases\r\nout of the same court provide some guidance.

The plaintiff testified that he lost\r\nbusiness, friends, and his reputation due to the dispute, he required psychiatric treatment\r\nand medications due to stress, he suffered short and long term memory loss, and he had\r\nattempted suicide due to depression.  His wife also testified about the effect of the dispute\r\non his life.  However, the court found that although the evidence supported a finding that\r\nhe suffered from past mental anguish, nothing in the record showed that $6,000,000 was\r\nreasonable compensation for that anguish.  <em>Id. </em>at 593. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Rehabilitation Facility at Austin, Inc. v.

It was discovered several hours later that two bones\r\nhad been broken in her right leg.  The next day, after further complaints of pain, it was\r\ndiscovered that two bones in her left leg were also broken.  She spent two months in full\r\nleg casts.  Although she had not been able to walk prior to the incident, after the incident\r\nshe was unable to stand even with a walker and could not sit for more than 20 minutes at\r\na time.  The rest of the time she was prone and could no longer enjoy car rides with her\r\nson.  She experienced pain at the fracture sites and became depressed.  There was also\r\ntestimony that her chances of living as long as she might have were decreased.  In finding\r\nthat she had been deprived of what little hope and independence she had, the court held\r\nthat the evidence supported an award of $1,235,000 for pain, mental anguish and physical\r\nimpairment alone.  <em>Id. </em>at 155.<em> </em> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough there is evidence that Granger suffered pain between July 4 and July 20\r\nas a result of breaking a bone in her leg, she may have been depressed, lacking an\r\nappetite, and may not have been timely washed after having defecated in her bed on one\r\noccasion, there is nothing in the evidence to support an award of $4.5 million.  There is no\r\nevidence that, if indeed she was producing abnormal urine in the days preceding her\r\ndeath, she was even aware of that fact or that it caused her worry or pain.  Further,\r\nbecause such a short time occurred between the incident where her leg was broken and\r\nher sudden deterioration and death, there is no evidence as to how the broken leg might\r\nhave affected her long term physical and mental prognosis.  We do not believe the record\r\nsupports an award of $4.5 million for Granger's physical pain and mental anguish.  We\r\ntherefore suggest a remittitur in the amount of $3.5 million in that regard.  Having\r\nsustained appellants' fifth issue to that extent, if a remittitur is not voluntarily filed, then a\r\nnew trial should be granted. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury was also asked what sum of money would fairly and reasonably\r\ncompensate Freeman for her damages, if any, resulting from the death of her mother.  In\r\nmaking that decision, the jury was instructed to consider loss of companionship and\r\nsociety, meaning the loss of positive benefits flowing from the love, comfort,\r\ncompanionship, and society that she would have received from her mother if she had lived,\r\nand mental anguish, meaning the emotional pain, torment, and suffering experienced by\r\nFreeman because of the death of her mother.  The jury was allowed to consider the\r\nrelationship between Freeman and her mother, their living arrangements, any extended\r\nabsences from one another, the harmony of their relations, and their common interests and\r\nactivities.  The jury awarded $4.5 million, the same amount awarded as survival damages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFreeman offered the following testimony with respect to her feelings on the death\r\nof her mother:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  It was horrible.  I was shocked, hurt, saddened.  My kids were all upset. \r\nYou know, we loved my mama a whole lot; and she loved us.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  Did it come too quickly for you, ma'am?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  Of course.

Do you feel a loss?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.  Terribly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.

They would always say,\r\n\"That's grandma's - - you know, \"That's what she liked.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tWe would bring her food, and my kids enjoyed my mother.  And they\r\ntold her things that went on with the day.  She took lots of time with them. \r\nAnd they miss her, and I miss her.  And it's like every holiday we miss my\r\nmother.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tAnd the way - - and the way she died is just like - - it's horrible. \r\nNobody should have had to suffer like that, nobody.  And I hope that\r\nnobody's mother or anybody else has to suffer ever what I feel in my heart. \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThere was additional testimony that Granger had suffered from nervous breakdowns\r\nthroughout her life and that Freeman and her sister had been raised by others while her\r\nmother was in and out of hospitals.  Granger had also been unable to raise a younger half-sister.  As an adult, Freeman built a relationship with her mother.  Beginning in 1987,\r\nGranger lived in her daughter's home, but Freeman became unable to physically care for\r\nher mother's needs, particularly those related to her catheter, and placed her in the\r\nnursing home in 1995.  During her stay at the nursing home, Granger had periods of time\r\nin which her mental status was altered.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Russell v.

In doing so, the court noted the plaintiff was a single parent and her son had lived\r\nat home at the time of his death, there was evidence that they did a lot of activities\r\ntogether such as skating, going to the mall, to movies and to Astroworld, there was a\r\nvideotape of him dancing with his mother shortly before his death, the plaintiff stayed with\r\nher son at the hospital for 12 days before he died and, even though she was advised he\r\nwould not recover, she talked to him and prayed for him, she still goes to his grave two or\r\nthree times a week to tell him she misses him, she places a memorial to him in the\r\nnewspaper every year, and she testified she has never stopped grieving for him.  <em>Id. </em>at\r\n486-87.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNo physical manifestation of mental anguish is necessary in wrongful death cases,\r\nand the issue can be submitted to the jury on the basis of the impact suggested by the\r\ncircumstances surrounding the loss.  <em>Moore v.

From the evidence presented, a rational trier of fact could have found that, at the\r\ntime of her death, the relationship between Freeman and her mother was close, and they\r\nhad lived together happily for eight years until Freeman could no longer care for her\r\nmother who, by the time of her admission to the nursing home, had significant health\r\nproblems.  However, throughout her life, Freeman and her mother had been separated for\r\nextended periods of time, and there is little or no evidence of common interests or\r\nactivities.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe believe in this instance the amount of the award is not supported by the\r\nevidence.  We therefore sustain appellants' sixth issue and suggest a remittitur of $3\r\nmillion in that regard.  In the event the remittitur is not voluntarily made, the matter will be\r\nreversed for a new trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants complain in their eighth issue that the trial court abused its discretion in\r\nadmitting the testimony of appellees' medical expert, Dr. J. D. Britton, because he was not\r\nqualified to render an expert opinion on the issues in this case relating to urology,\r\ncardiology, and pathology.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Britton testified he was a family practitioner for approximately nine years. During\r\nthat time, he was a medical director of a nursing home in Austin for almost seven years. \r\nThen, he moved to Houston and began a residency program in occupational medicine for\r\ntwo years.  He obtained a master's degree in public health and completed his training in\r\noccupational medicine.  He has since been in private practice in occupational medicine. \r\n Dr. Britton is certified in preventive medicine with occupational medicine as a specialty\r\nand board eligible in family practice, meaning he has not taken the final exam to be\r\ncertified.  His experience in the areas of urology, cardiology, and pathology are from\r\nmedical school and his subsequent internship, as well as having treated patients with\r\nurological and cardiac problems.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith respect to the care of Granger, he testified there was evidence that she was\r\nsuffering from a bladder infection and that the nursing home staff had failed to give her\r\nantibiotics, even though they had been prescribed, which was negligence.  She was known\r\nto have frequent urinary infections, had been treated with antibiotics for over a year and\r\nwhen the antibiotics ceased, she still had a \"smoldering infection.\"  He further stated that\r\nweakness resulting from her infection would have contributed to her fall, resulting in a\r\nbroken leg.  When Granger was admitted to the hospital with her broken leg, her white cell\r\ncount indicated an infection, which was untreated from July 1 through July 20.  On\r\nadmission to the hospital on July 19, her white cell count also indicated a severe infection. \r\nIn the emergency room on July 19, she was diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, but\r\nlater in intensive care, a nurse reported that there was pus coming out of her bladder. \r\nThere were also dark clots of urine which would indicate the urinary tract was bleeding. \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Dr. Britton, this infection entered into Granger's bloodstream and\r\nsepsis resulted in her death.  He further opined that sepsis can shut down any vital organ\r\nincluding the heart, resulting in sudden heart failure.  Also, the stress of infection and the\r\npain of a broken leg could have caused heart failure.  The fact that she had no\r\ntemperature is not indicative that she had no infection, because the elderly can have\r\nsubnormal or normal temperature when they have an infection, and a severe infection can\r\ncause intestinal bleeding. He further stated that as of 11:00 p.m. on July 19, the\r\ninformation available, including the fact she was elderly with gastrointestinal bleeding, a\r\nwhite cell count of 27,000, IV fluids needing to be administered, her blood pressure\r\ndropping and increased pulse and respiratory rates, indicated she was septic.  By the time\r\nantibiotics were given, it was too late.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccording to Britton, Granger had three kinds of bacteria that are common in\r\npersons with catheters for a long period of time.  The bacteria are easily treated if done\r\nso promptly.  If the hospital had received accurate records as to the nature of Granger's\r\nurine, her lack of input and output, and her non-responsiveness prior to admission to the\r\nhospital, proper treatment could have saved her life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Britton found it to be a breach of the standard of care for a nurse to not follow\r\nup on an order for an antibiotic, thereby discontinuing its use and that was a proximate\r\ncause of injury.  Further, the nursing home was grossly negligent, in his opinion, in their\r\nawareness of certain problems about which nothing was done, such as having no\r\nintake/outflow records.  The failure of the nursing home to communicate Granger's\r\nproblems to the hospital was reasonably certain to have caused her death.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a medical malpractice case, the plaintiff must establish a duty requiring the\r\ndefendants to conform to a certain standard of conduct, the applicable standard of care\r\nand its breach, a resulting injury, and a reasonably close causal connection between the\r\nbreach of the standard of care and the injury.  <em>Blan v.

App.--\r\nHouston [14<sup>th</sup> Dist.] 1999, no pet.).  Expert testimony is necessary to meet this burden.  <em>Id. \r\n</em>An expert qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify as\r\nto scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge if it will assist the trier of fact to\r\nunderstand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.  Tex. R. Evid. 702.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHowever, every licensed doctor is not automatically qualified to testify as an expert\r\non every medical question.  <em>Broders v.

The question to be resolved is the specific subject matter and the\r\nexpert's familiarity with it.  <em>See Heise</em>, 924 S.W.2d at 153; <em>Ali, </em>7 S.W.3d at 745.   The\r\nproponent of the expert bears the burden of showing that the expert's testimony is\r\nqualified, relevant to the issues, based on a reliable foundation, and will assist the trier of\r\nfact.  <em>E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc. v. Robinson, </em><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></span>, 556 (Tex.\r\n1995).  We review the ruling of the trial court as to the qualifications of an expert witness\r\nunder an abuse of discretion standard.  <em>Heise, </em>924 S.W.2d at 151.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants complain that Dr. Britton was not qualified by education, training,\r\nknowledge, or experience in the fields of urology, cardiology, or pathology, which would\r\nqualify him to make a diagnosis of sepsis or urosepsis or to render opinions that the same\r\nwere the proximate cause of Granger's broken leg, heart failure, and/or death.  This is\r\nprimarily so because his only training or experience in those fields occurred in medical\r\nschool or in his practice of family medicine, which ended in 1984.  Therefore, his opinions\r\nwere mere speculation. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe focus of our determination is not on the doctor's area of expertise, but on the\r\ncondition involved in the claim.  <em>Ali</em>, 7 S.W.3d at 746.  If Dr. Britton is offering opinions\r\npeculiar only to the fields of urology, cardiology, and pathology, then he is unqualified to\r\nrender them.  However, if the standards of care he discusses apply to any physician or\r\nhealth care provider who treats an elderly patient with long term catheter care and\r\ncardiology problems, then his lack of expertise in those special fields is irrelevant.  <em>See id.\r\n</em>at 747.    \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Britton's opinions as to the negligence of the nursing home involved the failure\r\nto give an antibiotic that had been prescribed for a urinary tract infection, to maintain\r\naccurate information in nursing home records and to communicate that information to\r\nhospital personnel upon transfer of a patient to the hospital.  The standard of care with\r\nrespect to these actions are common to all patients in a nursing home and, further, Dr.\r\nBritton had experience as a nursing home director.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs to the cause of death, Dr. Britton relied on his medical training and general\r\nexperience treating patients.  He further researched reference articles with respect to\r\nsepsis and the conditions which indicate its manifestation and also an article on\r\nprecipitating causes of heart failure.  Moreover, one of the consulting hospital physicians\r\nfor Granger on June 20, a cardiologist, gave his impression of her condition as\r\n\"hypotension and shock, probably secondary to sepsis, probably urosepsis and urinary\r\ntract infection.\"  Additionally, her attending physician at the time of her death, a doctor of\r\nosteopathy, listed one of the causes of death on her death certificate as sepsis.<sup> (9)</sup></span><span>   Thus,\r\nthere is nothing to indicate that the opinions offered required an expertise peculiar to the\r\nfields of cardiology or urology.  Further, multiple doctors who are not pathologists offered\r\nopinions as to the cause of Granger's death. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nallowing Dr. Britton to testify.  Appellants' seventh issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn their eighth issue, appellants argue that because Dr. Britton's testimony was not\r\ncompetent, the record contains no evidence to establish the standard of care, breach of\r\nthat standard, or proximate causation.  However, we have found Dr. Britton's testimony to\r\nhave been admissible, and thus there was some evidence on all three elements of\r\nappellees' claims.  It was up to the jury to assign whatever credibility they chose to that\r\ntestimony.  We therefore also overrule appellants' eighth issue. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSummarized, we overrule appellants' second, third, fourth, seventh and eighth\r\nissues and appellees' two cross-issues.  We sustain in part appellants' first issue by\r\nfinding that the damages should be limited to a single statutory cap.  Prejudgment interest\r\nis not subject to the cap and should be computed on the amount of survival damages\r\nalone.  We also sustain appellants' fifth and sixth issues.  If the suggested remittiturs are\r\nnot voluntarily made within a period of 45 days from the date of this opinion, this cause will\r\nbe reversed and remanded for a new trial.   If the remittiturs are made within that time, the\r\ncause will be affirmed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn T.

However, because there is no evidence that Cresthaven and Cantex are\r\nseparate legal entities, we fail to see any harm in its inclusion in the judgment, and\r\nappellants have not asserted any such harm.  \r\n<p>5. </p></span><span>Appellants also complain that the instruction did not assist the jury, but confused\r\nand misled them and improperly shifted the burden of proof.  However, in their reply brief,\r\nthey clarify that these complaints are raised only to show the harm suffered from the\r\ninstruction, not as a direct attack on the instruction itself.   \r\n<p>6. </p></span><span>There is no explanation as to why she was asked to recopy that particular note. \r\n<p>7. </p></span><span>Tashia Essex testified at trial that she was asked to fill in information for days she\r\ndid not work, but admitted that in her deposition she had testified she was only asked to\r\nfill in information for days that she did work.  No explanation for this inconsistency is\r\nprovided. \r\n<p>8. </p></span><span>The nursing home records show that Granger had a fainting episode, although\r\nFreeman stated she did not believe that to be true.  There is evidence that Granger was \r\nobese and weighed 295 pounds at the time of admission to the nursing home.  \r\n<p>9. </p></span><span>At trial, he changed his opinion of the cause of her death based on the autopsy\r\nreport, which found the cause to have been coronary arteriosclerosis.  He also stated that\r\nthe consulting cardiac physician now believes her death was cardiac-related. </span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
