FLSA, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 201 et seq., as amended by the Portal-to-Portal\n\nAct, 61 Stat. 86-87 (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 254(a)).     The\n\nplaintiffs work at the Indian Point II nuclear power plant\n\n(“Indian Point” or “the plant”), which was owned and\n\noperated by defendant Consolidated Edison Company of New\n\nYork, Inc. (“Con Ed”), and was sold in September 2001 to\n\ndefendant Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. (“Entergy”).\n\n    In the action against Con Ed, plaintiffs claim that the\n\nmethod of calculating the hourly overtime rate inadequately\n\naccounts for the premium paid to those who work the\n\nnightshifts.   The United States District Court for the\n\nSouthern District of New York (McMahon, J.) dismissed, and\n\nplaintiffs moved for leave to file an amended complaint.\n\nThe proposed amended complaint asserted the different and\n\n\n                              3\n\fdistinct FLSA claim to be paid wages for time spent in\n\nsecurity procedures and in “donning and doffing” required\n\nprotective gear (to use the term of art).   Judge McMahon\n\ndenied the motion for leave to amend as futile.\n\n    The suit against Entergy asserted claims which were\n\nsubstantially similar to those in the proposed amended\n\ncomplaint against Con Ed.1   The district court (Robinson,\n\nJ.) granted Entergy’s motion to dismiss, and denied\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend as futile.\n\n    On appeal, each case presents the question whether\n\ningress and egress and donning and doffing are compensable\n\nunder the FLSA.   Also at issue is the propriety of Con Ed’s\n\nmethod of calculating plaintiffs’ hourly overtime rate.\n\nThere are also state law claims; but it is stipulated that\n\nthose claims are controlled by our adjudication of the FLSA\n\nclaims.\n\n    We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n      Plaintiffs’ proposed amended complaint identified no\nadditional activities. As the district court observed, the\nproposed changes simply “add details about the procedures\n[plaintiffs are] required to perform [and] do not alter the\nnon-compensable nature of the activities [they] are required\nto perform before and after work.” Gorman v. Entergy, No.\n04 Civ. 8484 (S.D.N.Y. filed Apr. 17, 2006).\n                              4\n\f                              I\n\n    The FLSA, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., was enacted to\n\nensure that employees receive a “fair day’s pay for a fair\n\nday’s work,” Overnight Motor Transp. Co. v. Missel, 316 U.S.\n\n572, 578 (1942) (quoting 81 Cong. Rec. 4983 (1937) (message\n\nof President Franklin D. Roosevelt)), superseded by statute,\n\nPortal-to-Portal Act, 61 Stat. 86-87, as recognized in Trans\n\nWorld Airlines v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 128 n.22 (1985).\n\nOn the pay end, the FLSA “guarantee[s] compensation for all\n\nwork or employment engaged in by employees covered by the\n\nAct.”   Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No.\n\n123, 321 U.S. 590, 602-03 (1944).   But not all work-related\n\nactivities constitute “work or employment” that must be\n\ncompensated.   Kavanagh v. Grand Union Co., Inc., 192 F.3d\n\n269, 271-72 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n    In a short-lived 1946 holding, the Supreme Court\n\nconstrued the FLSA to require pay for the time employees\n\nspent walking on the employer’s premises before clocking in,\n\nand for donning and doffing aprons and overalls.   Anderson\n\nv. Mount Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680, 691-93 (1946),\n\nsuperseded by statute, Portal-to-Portal Act, 61 Stat. 86-87,\n\nas recognized in Reich v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 45 F.3d\n\n\n                              5\n\f646, 649 (2d Cir. 1995).     In 1947, the Portal-to-Portal Act\n\ncreated two exceptions from FLSA-mandated compensation:\n\n             (1) walking, riding, or traveling to and from\n             the actual place of performance of the\n             principal activity or activities which such\n             employee is employed to perform, and\n\n             (2) activities which are preliminary to or\n             postliminary to said principal activity or\n             activities,\n\n         which occur either prior to the time on any\n         particular workday at which such employee\n         commences, or subsequent to the time on any\n         particular workday at which he ceases, such\n         principal activity or activities.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 254(a).     Each of the two subsections bears upon\n\nplaintiffs’ claims.\n\n    Under subsection (1), no pay is required for travel to\n\nand from the place where the employee performs his\n\n“principal activities”; the FLSA regulations define\n\n“principal activities” as those “which the employee is\n\nemployed to perform.”     29 C.F.R. § 790.8(a) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).     Subsection (2) of the Portal-to-\n\nPortal Act undid the Anderson holding that required\n\ncompensation for putting on aprons and overalls, and thus\n\n“was intended to relieve employers from liability for\n\npreliminaries, most of them relatively effortless, that were\n\nthought to fall outside the conventional expectations and\n\n                                6\n\fcustoms of compensation.”    N.Y. City Transit Auth., 45 F.3d\n\nat 649.   A substantial body of case law discusses subsection\n\n(2)’s distinction between (on the one hand) preliminary and\n\npostliminary activities and (on the other) the principal\n\nactivities of employment; but the distinction remains\n\nelusive in application.\n\n    Nine years after the Portal-to-Portal Act, the Supreme\n\nCourt considered whether changing clothes and showering were\n\namong the principal work activities for workers at a battery\n\nplant who “must make extensive use of dangerously caustic\n\nand toxic materials, and are compelled by circumstances,\n\nincluding vital considerations of health and hygiene, to\n\nchange clothes and to shower.”      Steiner v. Mitchell, 350\n\nU.S. 247, 248 (1956).     After allowing that preliminary and\n\npostliminary “changing clothes and showering under normal\n\nconditions” were indisputably non-compensable, id. at 249,\n\nthe Court described the highly corrosive and toxic\n\nsubstances that permeate the battery plant, and ruled that:\n\n          activities performed either before or after the\n          regular work shift . . . are compensable under the\n          portal-to-portal provisions of the Fair Labor\n          Standards Act if those activities are an integral\n          and indispensable part of the principal activities\n          for which covered workmen are employed and are not\n          specifically excluded by [subsection 1 of the\n          Portal-to-Portal Act].\n\n                                7\n\fId. at 256 (emphasis added).     Thus, after Steiner,\n\nactivities that are “integral and indispensable” to\n\nprincipal activities are compensable under the FLSA (as well\n\nas the principal activities themselves).\n\n    On the same day Steiner issued, the Supreme Court\n\ndecided a slaughterhouse case, holding that knife-sharpening\n\nis “an integral part of and indispensable to the various\n\nbutchering activities for which [the workers] were\n\nprincipally employed.”    Mitchell v. King Packing Co., 350\n\nU.S. 260, 263 (1956).     The Mitchell Court shed light on the\n\nmeaning of “integral” (as used in Steiner):     sharpening\n\nknives is both indispensable to the task of butchering\n\nanimals, and intrinsically “connected with” it.    Id. at 262.\n\nThe Court cited the testimony of a supervisor to the effect\n\nthat “a dull knife would slow down production . . . , affect\n\nthe appearance of the meat as well as the quality of the\n\nhides, cause waste and make for accidents; ‘that a knife to\n\nbe of any practical value in a knife job has to be sharp.’”\n\nId. (ellipses omitted).\n\n    In a more recent case, IBP v. Alvarez, the parties left\n\nuncontested the finding that the donning and doffing of\n\n“unique protective gear” constitute “principal activities”;\n\n                                8\n\fat issue in the Supreme Court was:     whether employees must\n\nbe paid for time waiting to enter the locker room, time in\n\ntransit from the locker room to the job-site, and time in\n\ntransit back to the locker room.    546 U.S. 21, 29-30, 39-40\n\n(2005).\n\n    The Court first held that “any activity that is\n\n‘integral and indispensable’ to a ‘principal activity’ is\n\nitself a ‘principal activity’ under . . . the Portal-to-\n\nPortal Act.”   Id. at 37.   Since it was uncontested that the\n\nspecialized protective gear was “integral and indispensable”\n\nunder Steiner, the donning and doffing was itself a\n\n“principal activity.”   And because employees are paid for a\n\ncontinuous workday--which begins with the first principal\n\nactivity and ends with the last--the Portal-to-Portal Act\n\nhas no application once the workday has begun.    Id. at 28-29\n\n(citing 29 C.F.R. § 790.6(a)).     Therefore, “during a\n\ncontinuous workday, any walking time that occurs after the\n\nbeginning of the employee’s first principal activity and\n\nbefore the end of the employee’s last principal activity is\n\n[compensable].”   Id. at 37.\n\n    Nevertheless, the Court held that awaiting the first\n\nprincipal activity of the workday is not itself a principal\n\n\n                               9\n\factivity, id. at 40; it cited 29 C.F.R. § 790.7(g), which\n\n“characterizes the time that employees must spend waiting to\n\ncheck in . . . as generally a ‘preliminary’ activity covered\n\nby the Portal-to-Portal Act.”        Id. at 41-42.   As the Court\n\nemphasized, “the fact that certain preshift activities are\n\nnecessary for employees to engage in their principal\n\nactivities does not mean that those preshift activities are\n\n‘integral and indispensable’ to a ‘principal activity’ under\n\nSteiner.”   Id. at 40-41.\n\n\n\n                                II\n\n    Before the Indian Point employees can perform the tasks\n\nfor which they were hired, they spend between ten and thirty\n\nminutes a day passing through multiple layers of security\n\nand suiting up.   Am. Compl. ¶ 19.       The question is whether\n\nthese activities are “‘integral and indispensable’ to a\n\n‘principal activity’ under Steiner,” IBP, 546 U.S. at 39-40,\n\nand therefore (under IBP) principal activities in\n\nthemselves.   If so, they are compensable under the FLSA.\n\n    We review de novo a district court’s grant of a motion\n\nto dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).       E & L Consulting, Ltd. v.\n\nDoman Indus. Ltd., 472 F.3d 23, 28 (2d Cir. 2006).        For the\n\n\n                                10\n\fpurpose of such a review, this Court must accept as true all\n\nallegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the non-moving party.    Taylor v. Vt.\n\nDep’t of Educ., 313 F.3d 768, 776 (2d Cir. 2002).\n\nGenerally, we review a district court’s denial of a motion\n\nto amend under the abuse of discretion standard.    Commander\n\nOil Corp. v. Barlo Equip. Corp., 215 F.3d 321, 333 (2d Cir.\n\n2000).     “However, if the denial of leave to amend is based\n\nupon a legal interpretation . . . we review [it] de novo.”\n\nLittlejohn v. Artuz, 271 F.3d 360, 362 (2d Cir. 2001) (per\n\ncuriam).    Here, each district judge denied the motions for\n\nleave to amend as futile based on their interpretation of\n\nthe FLSA; so we review those denials de novo.\n\n    Paragraph 15 of the amended complaint against Entergy\n\n(which is substantially similar to the proposed amended\n\ncomplaint against Con Ed, see n.1, supra) specifies the\n\nactivities for which pay is sought:\n\n                (i) Waiting in traffic outside the plant\n\n            entrance;\n\n                (ii) Badge inspection at the entrance,\n\n            including a visual check of the interior of the\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\f         car, and occasional random vehicle inspection\n\n         (engine, trunk, glove compartment, undercarriage);\n\n             (iii) Parking and walking to the command post;\n\n             (iv) At the command post, waiting in line and\n\n         passing through a radiation detector, x-ray\n\n         machine, and explosive material detector;\n\n             (v) Waiting in line to swipe an ID badge and\n\n         to palm a sensor;\n\n             (vi) Going to the locker room to obtain and\n\n         don metal capped safety boots, safety glasses, and\n\n         a helmet (if applicable);\n\n             (vii) Walking to the job-site;\n\n             (viii) And at the end of the shift, doing many\n\n         of these things in reverse.2\n\nAm. Compl. ¶ 15.\n\n    Plaintiffs’ contention that these activities are\n\n“integral and indispensable to the performance of [their]\n\nprincipal activities,”3 Am. Compl. ¶ 15, relies chiefly on\n\n\n    2\n      The egress radiation-test is apparently more\nsensitive and takes more time.\n    3\n      The pleadings (and the proposed amended pleadings)\nomit plaintiffs’ particular responsibilities; but\nplaintiffs’ counsel said at argument that plaintiffs work in\nchemical applications, radiology, maintenance and the\n                             12\n\fthe idea that they are “indispensable” or required--without\n\naccounting for Steiner’s requirement that they be “integral”\n\nas well.   Steiner, 350 U.S. at 256.\n\n      “Indispensable” is not synonymous with “integral.”\n\n“Indispensable” means “necessary.”     See Webster’s Third New\n\nInt’l Dictionary (Unabridged) 1152, 1510-11 (1986).\n\n“Integral” means, inter alia, “essential to completeness”;\n\n“organically joined or linked”; “composed of constituent\n\nparts making a whole.”   Id. at 1173.    At the same time, “it\n\nis one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed\n\njurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary.”\n\nCabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir. 1945).     The\n\ncaselaw gives better guidance by apt examples:     Sharpening\n\nthe knife is integral to carving a carcass, Mitchell, 350\n\nU.S. at 263; powering up and testing an x-ray machine is\n\nintegral to taking x-rays, Kosakow v. New Rochelle Radiology\n\nAssocs., P.C., 274 F.3d 706, 717-18 (2d Cir. 2001); and\n\nfeeding, training and walking the dog is integral to the\n\nwork of a K-9 officer, Reich v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 45\n\nF.3d 646 (2d Cir. 1995), limited in part by IBP, 546 U.S. at\n\n21.   See also IBP, 546 U.S. at 40-41 (observing that\n\n\ncontrol room.\n                              13\n\factivities which are “necessary” (or indispensable) to a\n\nprincipal activity are not thereby “integral and\n\nindispensable”); 29 C.F.R. § 790.7(d) (noting, for example,\n\nthat “the carrying by a logger of a portable power saw or\n\nother heavy equipment (as distinguished from ordinary hand\n\ntools) on his trip into the woods to the cutting area . . .\n\nis not segregable from the simultaneous performance of his\n\nassigned work” and is thus integral to his principal\n\nactivities) (emphasis added).\n\n    Steiner is in one sense the most apt analog, dealing as\n\nit does with donning and doffing gear that protects against\n\nworkplace dangers that transcend ordinary risks.         At issue\n\nin Steiner was exposure to corrosive and toxic substances\n\nthat permeated a battery plant; at issue here is the\n\nsecurity of a nuclear power plant.         The analogy is, however,\n\nunsustainable.    The Steiner opinion invites a narrow\n\ninterpretation:    “[I]t would be difficult to conjure up an\n\ninstance where changing clothes and showering are more\n\nclearly an integral and indispensable part of the principal\n\nactivity of the employment than in the case of these\n\nemployees.”   350 U.S. at 256.        Without the taking of the\n\nmeasures required, the environment of the battery plant\n\n\n                                 14\n\fcould not sustain life--given the toxic substances in\n\nliquid, solid, powder and vapor form (and in the dust of the\n\nair) that “permeate[d] the entire [battery] plant and\n\neverything and everyone in it.”   Id. at 249, 250.   Steiner\n\ntherefore supports the view that when work is done in a\n\nlethal atmosphere, the measures that allow entry and\n\nimmersion into the destructive element may be integral to\n\nall work done there, just as a diver’s donning of wetsuit,\n\noxygen tank and mouthpiece may be integral to the work even\n\nthough it is not the (underwater) task that the employer\n\nwishes done.\n\n    By contrast, the activities for which plaintiffs here\n\nseek compensation, while arguably indispensable, are not\n\nintegral to their principal activities.4\n\n\n\n    A.   Ingress and Egress Security Procedures\n\n    The activities required to enter and exit Indian Point-\n\n-from waiting in line at the vehicle entrance through the\n\nfinal card-swipe and handprint analysis--are necessary in\n\n\n\n    4\n      In the nuclear containment area--which more closely\nresembles the battery plant--Indian Point employees wore\nspecialized gear and dosimeters, and were compensated for\ndonning and doffing.\n                             15\n\fthe sense that they are required and serve essential\n\npurposes of security; but they are not integral to principal\n\nwork activities.   These security-related activities are\n\nmodern paradigms of the preliminary and postliminary\n\nactivities described in the Portal-to-Portal Act, in\n\nparticular, travel time.   The plain wording of subsection\n\n(1) of the Portal-to-Portal Act exempts from the FLSA:\n\n“walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place\n\nof performance of the principal activity or activities which\n\nsuch employee is employed to perform.”   29 U.S.C. §\n\n254(a) (1); see also 29 C.F.R. § 790.7(c).5\n\n    Plaintiffs argue that the Portal-to-Portal Act was\n\nenacted when the time-consuming security measures at issue\n\nmay not have been envisioned, and there is some force to the\n\nobservation that security measures at sensitive facilities\n\n(and elsewhere) are becoming increasingly invasive, layered\n\nand time-consuming.   But the text of the statute does not\n\ndepend on the purpose of any preliminaries, or how much time\n\nsuch preliminaries may consume.    Travel time was held to be\n\n\n    5\n      Rules may yield to particular instances. For\nexample, passing through preliminary security procedures may\nbe integral to the principal activity of an employee\nresponsible for monitoring, testing and reporting on the\nplant’s infrastructure security.\n                              16\n\f“normal” (and therefore outside the FLSA) in Kavanagh v.\n\nGrand Union Co., Inc., even though the plaintiff (who\n\nperformed mechanical services in defendant’s supermarkets)\n\ncommuted five to nine hours a day depending on the\n\nsupermarkets to which he was dispatched.   192 F.3d 269, 272-\n\n73 (2d Cir. 1999).   Normal travel time “does not represent\n\nan objective standard of how far most workers commute or how\n\nfar they may reasonably be expected to commute.   Instead, it\n\nrepresents a subjective standard, defined by what is usual\n\nwithin the confines of a particular employment\n\nrelationship.”   Id. at 272.   By the same token, security\n\nmeasures that are rigorous and that lengthen the trip to the\n\njob-site do not thereby become principal activities of the\n\nemployment.   At Indian Point, this is easily demonstrated\n\nbecause the security measures at entry are required (to one\n\ndegree or another) for everyone entering the plant--\n\nregardless of what an employee does (servicing fuel rods or\n\nmaking canteen sandwiches)--and including visitors.    See\n\nGorman v. Entergy, No. 04 Civ. 8484 (S.D.N.Y. filed Apr. 17,\n\n2006) (citing plaintiffs’ memorandum in opposition to\n\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss).\n\n\n\n\n                               17\n\f    B.    Donning and Doffing of Protective Gear\n\n    Similarly, a helmet, safety glasses, and steel-toed\n\nboots may be indispensable to plaintiffs’ principal\n\nactivities without being integral.6     The donning and doffing\n\nof such generic protective gear is not different in kind\n\nfrom “changing clothes and showering under normal\n\nconditions,” which, under Steiner, are not covered by the\n\nFLSA.    350 U.S. at 249.    Among the activities classified in\n\nthe regulations as preliminary and postliminary are\n\n“checking in and out and waiting in line to do so, changing\n\nclothes, washing up or showering, and waiting in line to\n\nreceive pay checks.”     29 C.F.R. § 790.7(g) (emphasis added).\n\nThe donning and doffing of generic protective gear is not\n\nrendered integral by being required by the employer or by\n\ngovernment regulation.      See Reich v. IBP, Inc., 38 F.3d\n\n1123, 1126 (10th Cir. 1994) (holding that donning and\n\ndoffing safety glasses, a pair of earplugs, a hard hat and\n\nsafety shoes, “although essential to the job, and required\n\nby the employer,” are pre- and postliminary activities) ;\n\n\n    6\n      At argument, plaintiffs’ counsel conceded that the\nprotective gear listed in the complaint (helmets, safety\nglasses, and steel-toed shoes) were the only protective gear\nthat plaintiffs were required to wear; if given the\nopportunity to re-plead, counsel would not supplement.\n                                 18\n\fAnderson v. Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., 147 F. Supp. 2d 556, 563\n\n(E.D. Tex. 2001) (same), aff'd, 44 Fed. Appx. 652 (5th Cir.\n\n2002) (not precedential).   But see Alvarez v. IBP, Inc., 339\n\nF.3d 894, 903 (9th Cir. 2003) (observing that the “donning,\n\ndoffing, and cleaning of non-unique gear (e.g., hardhats)\n\n[is] ‘integral and indispensable’ as that term is defined in\n\nSteiner”), aff’d on other grounds, IBP, 546 U.S. at 21.     The\n\ndonning and doffing of a helmet, safety glasses and boots\n\nare “relatively effortless,” non-compensable, preliminary\n\ntasks.   N.Y. City Transit Auth., 45 F.3d at 649.   And even\n\nif the donning and doffing of a helmet, safety glasses and\n\nsteel-toed boots were “integral and indispensable” to\n\nplaintiffs’ principal activities, we would be required to\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fconsider whether the time so spent was de minimis.7   See id.\n\n\n\n    7\n      As this Court explained in New York City Transit\nAuthority:\n\n         [T]he de minimis doctrine was first articulated by\n         the Supreme Court in Anderson . . . : “When the\n         matter in issue concerns only a few seconds or\n         minutes of work beyond the scheduled working\n         hours, such trifles may be disregarded. . . . It\n         is only when an employee is required to give up a\n         substantial measure of his time and effort that\n         compensable working time is involved.”\n\n45 F.3d at 652 (quoting Anderson, 32 U.S. at 692). Three\nfactors bear upon the determination of whether the time\nspent in a particular activity is de minimis: (1) the\nadministrative difficulty of recording the time; (2) the\nsize of the claim in the aggregate; and (3) whether the\ntasks occur regularly. Id. (citing Lindow v. United States,\n738 F.2d 1057, 1062-63 (9th Cir. 1984)).\n\n     The tasks here are repeated daily and there would be\nlittle administrative difficulty in recording them. As to\nthe size of the potential claim, plaintiffs’ counsel was\nasked at argument: “Is there anything special about these\nshoes or glasses, or safety caps that takes longer than what\nwe could, in or own experience, know about putting [them]\non?” Counsel responded: “Not to my knowledge.” And counsel\nacknowledged that these shoes are not somehow more\ncomplicated than an ordinary shoe.\n\n     The pleadings would not contradict a conclusion that\nthe time so spent would be de minimis; but we decide this\ncase on the ground that the activities at issue are\npreliminary and postliminary because that conclusion is more\neasily arrived at on the pleadings. Moreover, it is perhaps\nunclear (after IBP’s continuous workday rule) whether the de\nminimis test measures only the first integral and\nindispensable activity of the day, or includes as well all\nintervening steps that precede the next principal activity\nof the continuous workday.\n                             20\n\fat 652-53.\n\n                           *         *   *\n\n      Because plaintiffs can prove no set of facts entitling\n\nthem to compensation for time spent entering and exiting the\n\nfacility, and donning and doffing a helmet, safety glasses\n\nand boots, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs’ claims\n\nagainst Entergy and the denial by both district judges of\n\nleave to amend the complaints.\n\n\n\n                               III\n\n      Plaintiffs challenge the grant of summary judgment\n\ndismissing their overtime-compensation claims against Con\n\nEd.   According to plaintiffs, the method used to calculate\n\nthe hourly rate for overtime work inadequately accounted for\n\nthe premium rate paid for nightshifts at the plant.\n\n      We review de novo the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment, construing the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the non-moving party.   Cioffi v. Averill Park Cent. Sch.\n\nDist. Bd. of Educ., 444 F.3d 158, 162 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate only where “there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving\n\n\n\n\n                               21\n\fparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”       Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n    The FLSA generally requires that an employee who works\n\nmore than forty hours in a given week be paid for the excess\n\ntime at a rate “not less than one and one-half times the\n\nregular rate at which he is employed.”   29 U.S.C. §\n\n207(a)(1) (emphasis added).   The regular rate is “all\n\nremuneration for employment paid to . . . the employee,”\n\nminus certain exceptions inapplicable here.   Id. at §\n\n207(e).   As the Supreme Court has explained, it is “the\n\nhourly rate actually paid the employee for the normal, non-\n\novertime workweek,” and “must reflect all payments which the\n\nparties have agreed shall be received regularly during the\n\nworkweek, exclusive of overtime payments.”    Walling v.\n\nYoungerman-Reynolds Hardwood Co., 325 U.S. 419, 424-25\n\n(1945).\n\n    The collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) between\n\nplaintiffs and Con Ed created a three-tiered compensation\n\nstructure: (i) “straight” or “basic” time for day shifts,\n\n(ii) an 8% premium for the evening shift (between 6:00 p.m.\n\nand midnight), and (iii) a 10% premium for the nightshift\n\n\n\n\n                              22\n\f(between midnight and 7:00 a.m.).     These latter two premiums\n\nare collectively referred to as the nightshift differential.\n\n    Con Ed argues that the regular rate should be\n\ncalculated using “a weighted average of the employee’s\n\nearnings at each rate of pay worked that week (i.e. basic\n\nrate, 8% nightshift . . . differential rate, or 10%\n\nnightshift differential rate).”     In other words, the regular\n\nrate should be derived from the total compensation paid to\n\nan employee in a given pay period divided by the number of\n\nhours worked; such a calculation naturally encompasses the\n\nnightshift differentials, if any, worked by the employee.8\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that “[t]here is no reason to\n\ndetermine a weighted average” because “pursuant to the CBA[,\n\nplaintiffs] are employed solely on the basis of a single\n\nhourly rate, which is their respective ‘regular rate.’”“\n\nPlaintiffs argue that this “single hourly rate” should be\n\n\n\n    8\n      The method Con Ed actually uses has more steps, but\nyields the same result as a more simple weighting\ncalculation. Con Ed’s method (1) calculates how much\nadditional money an employee earned as a result of the\nnighttime differentials; (2) divides that number by the\ntotal number of hours worked in the week; (3) multiplies\nthat number by the number of overtime hours worked in the\nweek; (4) it then divides that number in half (to account\nfor the time-and-a-half); and (5) compensates the employee\nby that additional increment.\n                             23\n\fthe 10% nightshift differential, regardless of the shift\n\nactually worked, by virtue of CBA Paragraph 13(b):\n\n“Assignment to Work Functions: Any employee assigned to\n\nperform any lower or lateral job or function, except\n\npursuant to a demotion, shall receive his regular rate of\n\npay while performing such work.”   We fail to see how this,\n\nor any other provision of the CBA supports plaintiffs’\n\nargument.9\n\n    This Court has already validated the weighted average\n\nmethod of determining the regular rate, which we described\n\nas “properly calculated by adding all of the wages payable\n\nfor the hours worked at the applicable shift rates and\n\ndividing by the total number of hours worked.”   Brock v.\n\n\n\n    9\n      The clear and unambiguous language of Paragraph 13(b)\nsimply provides that temporary reassignments that pay less\nwill not affect an employee’s actual compensation, unless\nthe reassignment was a result of a demotion. See Duse v.\nInt’l Bus. Machs. Corp., 252 F.3d 151, 158 (2d Cir. 2001)\n(“Where the language of the contract is clear and\nunambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to\nits terms and those terms may be the basis for summary\njudgment.”) (internal citations omitted). Plaintiffs’\nargument that the contractual provision establishes a single\nhourly rate is nonsensical; the CBA expressly provides for\nat least three rates (straight time, the 8% evening premium,\nand the 10% night premium). See Bank Julius Baer & Co. v.\nWaxfield Ltd., 424 F.3d 278, 283 (2d Cir. 2005) (observing\nthat “canons of construction” forbid contractual\ninterpretations that “lead to absurd results”).\n                             24\n\fWilamowsky, 833 F.2d 11, 14 (2d Cir. 1987); see also id. at\n\n14, 17 (approving the district court’s conclusion “that the\n\nstatutory regular rate was . . . the weighted average hourly\n\nrate of all compensation received by the employee”).10\n\n    Moreover, the FLSA regulations expressly approve the\n\nweighted average method:\n\n         Where an employee in a single workweek works at\n         two or more different types of work for which\n         different nonovertime rates of pay . . . have been\n         established, his regular rate for that week is the\n         weighted average of such rates. That is, his\n         total earnings (except statutory exclusions) are\n         computed to include his compensation during the\n         workweek from all such rates, and are then divided\n         by the total number of hours worked at all jobs.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 778.115.11\n\n\n\n\n    10\n       In Brock, as here, pay for each of three shifts was\npaid at a different hourly rate. 833 F.2d at 13-14. For\novertime, the employer generally paid employees 150% of the\nday-shift rate (that being the lowest hourly rate paid for\nnon-overtime work). Id. In Brock, we rejected that pay in\nfavor of the weighted average method. Id. at 14.\n    11\n       As plaintiffs observe, the example used in this\nregulation assumes that the two rates of pay are a result of\ndifferent jobs, not nighttime differentials. But this\nobservation misapprehends the purpose of the regulation,\nwhich is simply to provide an example of a means of\ncalculating the regular rate. See 29 C.F.R. § 778.109 (“The\nfollowing sections give some examples of the proper method\nof determining the regular rate of pay in particular\ninstances . . . .” (emphasis added)).\n                             25\n\f    Finally, plaintiffs’ argument under the CBA succumbs to\n\nthe rule that “the regular rate of pay cannot be left to a\n\ndeclaration by the parties as to what is to be treated as\n\nthe regular rate for an employee[;] it must be drawn from\n\nwhat happens under the employment contract.”   Bay Ridge\n\nOperating Co. v. Aaron, 334 U.S. 446, 464 (1948) (emphasis\n\nadded) ; see also Walling, 325 U.S. at 424 (observing that\n\nthe regular rate “is not an arbitrary label chosen by the\n\nparties; it is an actual fact”); 29 C.F.R. § 778.109 (same).\n\nBecause Con Ed’s weighted average method adequately accounts\n\nfor the compensation actually received by employees in\n\ncalculating the regular rate, we affirm the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment to Con Ed.\n\n                       *        *    *\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the\n\ndistrict courts are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                26\n\f",

The United States District Court for the\n\nSouthern District of New York (McMahon, J.) dismissed, and\n\nplaintiffs moved for leave to file an amended complaint.\n\nThe proposed amended complaint asserted the different and\n\n\n                              3\n\fdistinct FLSA claim to be paid wages for time spent in\n\nsecurity procedures and in “donning and doffing” required\n\nprotective gear (to use the term of art).   Judge McMahon\n\ndenied the motion for leave to amend as futile.\n\n    The suit against Entergy asserted claims which were\n\nsubstantially similar to those in the proposed amended\n\ncomplaint against Con Ed.1   The district court (Robinson,\n\nJ.) granted Entergy’s motion to dismiss, and denied\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend as futile.\n\n    On appeal, each case presents the question whether\n\ningress and egress and donning and doffing are compensable\n\nunder the FLSA.   Also at issue is the propriety of Con Ed’s\n\nmethod of calculating plaintiffs’ hourly overtime rate.\n\nThere are also state law claims; but it is stipulated that\n\nthose claims are controlled by our adjudication of the FLSA\n\nclaims.\n\n    We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n      Plaintiffs’ proposed amended complaint identified no\nadditional activities. As the district court observed, the\nproposed changes simply “add details about the procedures\n[plaintiffs are] required to perform [and] do not alter the\nnon-compensable nature of the activities [they] are required\nto perform before and after work.” Gorman v.

In 1947, the Portal-to-Portal Act\n\ncreated two exceptions from FLSA-mandated compensation:\n\n             (1) walking, riding, or traveling to and from\n             the actual place of performance of the\n             principal activity or activities which such\n             employee is employed to perform, and\n\n             (2) activities which are preliminary to or\n             postliminary to said principal activity or\n             activities,\n\n         which occur either prior to the time on any\n         particular workday at which such employee\n         commences, or subsequent to the time on any\n         particular workday at which he ceases, such\n         principal activity or activities.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 254(a).     Each of the two subsections bears upon\n\nplaintiffs’ claims.\n\n    Under subsection (1), no pay is required for travel to\n\nand from the place where the employee performs his\n\n“principal activities”; the FLSA regulations define\n\n“principal activities” as those “which the employee is\n\nemployed to perform.”     29 C.F.R. § 790.8(a) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).     Subsection (2) of the Portal-to-\n\nPortal Act undid the Anderson holding that required\n\ncompensation for putting on aprons and overalls, and thus\n\n“was intended to relieve employers from liability for\n\npreliminaries, most of them relatively effortless, that were\n\nthought to fall outside the conventional expectations and\n\n                                6\n\fcustoms of compensation.”    N.Y. City Transit Auth., 45 F.3d\n\nat 649.   A substantial body of case law discusses subsection\n\n(2)’s distinction between (on the one hand) preliminary and\n\npostliminary activities and (on the other) the principal\n\nactivities of employment; but the distinction remains\n\nelusive in application.\n\n    Nine years after the Portal-to-Portal Act, the Supreme\n\nCourt considered whether changing clothes and showering were\n\namong the principal work activities for workers at a battery\n\nplant who “must make extensive use of dangerously caustic\n\nand toxic materials, and are compelled by circumstances,\n\nincluding vital considerations of health and hygiene, to\n\nchange clothes and to shower.”      Steiner v.

After allowing that preliminary and\n\npostliminary “changing clothes and showering under normal\n\nconditions” were indisputably non-compensable, id. at 249,\n\nthe Court described the highly corrosive and toxic\n\nsubstances that permeate the battery plant, and ruled that:\n\n          activities performed either before or after the\n          regular work shift . . . are compensable under the\n          portal-to-portal provisions of the Fair Labor\n          Standards Act if those activities are an integral\n          and indispensable part of the principal activities\n          for which covered workmen are employed and are not\n          specifically excluded by [subsection 1 of the\n          Portal-to-Portal Act].\n\n                                7\n\fId. at 256 (emphasis added).     Thus, after Steiner,\n\nactivities that are “integral and indispensable” to\n\nprincipal activities are compensable under the FLSA (as well\n\nas the principal activities themselves).\n\n    On the same day Steiner issued, the Supreme Court\n\ndecided a slaughterhouse case, holding that knife-sharpening\n\nis “an integral part of and indispensable to the various\n\nbutchering activities for which [the workers] were\n\nprincipally employed.”    Mitchell v. King Packing Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105346\"><a href=\"/opinion/105346/mitchell-v-king-packing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (1956).     The Mitchell Court shed light on the\n\nmeaning of “integral” (as used in Steiner):     sharpening\n\nknives is both indispensable to the task of butchering\n\nanimals, and intrinsically “connected with” it.    Id. at 262.\n\nThe Court cited the testimony of a supervisor to the effect\n\nthat “a dull knife would slow down production . . . , affect\n\nthe appearance of the meat as well as the quality of the\n\nhides, cause waste and make for accidents; ‘that a knife to\n\nbe of any practical value in a knife job has to be sharp.’”\n\nId.

Alvarez, the parties left\n\nuncontested the finding that the donning and doffing of\n\n“unique protective gear” constitute “principal activities”;\n\n                                8\n\fat issue in the Supreme Court was:     whether employees must\n\nbe paid for time waiting to enter the locker room, time in\n\ntransit from the locker room to the job-site, and time in\n\ntransit back to the locker room.    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1991818\"><a href=\"/opinion/1991818/ibp-inc-v-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29-30, 39-40\n\n(2005).\n\n    The Court first held that “any activity that is\n\n‘integral and indispensable’ to a ‘principal activity’ is\n\nitself a ‘principal activity’ under . . . the Portal-to-\n\nPortal Act.”   Id. at 37.   Since it was uncontested that the\n\nspecialized protective gear was “integral and indispensable”\n\nunder Steiner, the donning and doffing was itself a\n\n“principal activity.”   And because employees are paid for a\n\ncontinuous workday--which begins with the first principal\n\nactivity and ends with the last--the Portal-to-Portal Act\n\nhas no application once the workday has begun.    Id. at 28-29\n\n(citing 29 C.F.R. § 790.6(a)).     Therefore, “during a\n\ncontinuous workday, any walking time that occurs after the\n\nbeginning of the employee’s first principal activity and\n\nbefore the end of the employee’s last principal activity is\n\n[compensable].”   Id. at 37.\n\n    Nevertheless, the Court held that awaiting the first\n\nprincipal activity of the workday is not itself a principal\n\n\n                               9\n\factivity, id. at 40; it cited 29 C.F.R. § 790.7(g), which\n\n“characterizes the time that employees must spend waiting to\n\ncheck in . . . as generally a ‘preliminary’ activity covered\n\nby the Portal-to-Portal Act.”        Id. at 41-42.   As the Court\n\nemphasized, “the fact that certain preshift activities are\n\nnecessary for employees to engage in their principal\n\nactivities does not mean that those preshift activities are\n\n‘integral and indispensable’ to a ‘principal activity’ under\n\nSteiner.”   Id. at 40-41.\n\n\n\n                                II\n\n    Before the Indian Point employees can perform the tasks\n\nfor which they were hired, they spend between ten and thirty\n\nminutes a day passing through multiple layers of security\n\nand suiting up.

The question is whether\n\nthese activities are “‘integral and indispensable’ to a\n\n‘principal activity’ under Steiner,” IBP, 546 U.S. at 39-40,\n\nand therefore (under IBP) principal activities in\n\nthemselves.

At issue\n\nin Steiner was exposure to corrosive and toxic substances\n\nthat permeated a battery plant; at issue here is the\n\nsecurity of a nuclear power plant.         The analogy is, however,\n\nunsustainable.    The Steiner opinion invites a narrow\n\ninterpretation:    “[I]t would be difficult to conjure up an\n\ninstance where changing clothes and showering are more\n\nclearly an integral and indispensable part of the principal\n\nactivity of the employment than in the case of these\n\nemployees.”   350 U.S. at 256.        Without the taking of the\n\nmeasures required, the environment of the battery plant\n\n\n                                 14\n\fcould not sustain life--given the toxic substances in\n\nliquid, solid, powder and vapor form (and in the dust of the\n\nair) that “permeate[d] the entire [battery] plant and\n\neverything and everyone in it.”   Id. at 249, 250.   Steiner\n\ntherefore supports the view that when work is done in a\n\nlethal atmosphere, the measures that allow entry and\n\nimmersion into the destructive element may be integral to\n\nall work done there, just as a diver’s donning of wetsuit,\n\noxygen tank and mouthpiece may be integral to the work even\n\nthough it is not the (underwater) task that the employer\n\nwishes done.\n\n    By contrast, the activities for which plaintiffs here\n\nseek compensation, while arguably indispensable, are not\n\nintegral to their principal activities.4\n\n\n\n    A.   Ingress and Egress Security Procedures\n\n    The activities required to enter and exit Indian Point-\n\n-from waiting in line at the vehicle entrance through the\n\nfinal card-swipe and handprint analysis--are necessary in\n\n\n\n    4\n      In the nuclear containment area--which more closely\nresembles the battery plant--Indian Point employees wore\nspecialized gear and dosimeters, and were compensated for\ndonning and doffing.\n                             15\n\fthe sense that they are required and serve essential\n\npurposes of security; but they are not integral to principal\n\nwork activities.   These security-related activities are\n\nmodern paradigms of the preliminary and postliminary\n\nactivities described in the Portal-to-Portal Act, in\n\nparticular, travel time.   The plain wording of subsection\n\n(1) of the Portal-to-Portal Act exempts from the FLSA:\n\n“walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place\n\nof performance of the principal activity or activities which\n\nsuch employee is employed to perform.”   29 U.S.C. §\n\n254(a) (1); see also 29 C.F.R. § 790.7(c).5\n\n    Plaintiffs argue that the Portal-to-Portal Act was\n\nenacted when the time-consuming security measures at issue\n\nmay not have been envisioned, and there is some force to the\n\nobservation that security measures at sensitive facilities\n\n(and elsewhere) are becoming increasingly invasive, layered\n\nand time-consuming.   But the text of the statute does not\n\ndepend on the purpose of any preliminaries, or how much time\n\nsuch preliminaries may consume.    Travel time was held to be\n\n\n    5\n      Rules may yield to particular instances. For\nexample, passing through preliminary security procedures may\nbe integral to the principal activity of an employee\nresponsible for monitoring, testing and reporting on the\nplant’s infrastructure security.\n                              16\n\f“normal” (and therefore outside the FLSA) in Kavanagh v.\n\nGrand Union Co., Inc., even though the plaintiff (who\n\nperformed mechanical services in defendant’s supermarkets)\n\ncommuted five to nine hours a day depending on the\n\nsupermarkets to which he was dispatched.   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766229\"><a href=\"/opinion/766229/david-kavanagh-v-grand-union-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272-\n\n73 (2d Cir. 1999).   Normal travel time “does not represent\n\nan objective standard of how far most workers commute or how\n\nfar they may reasonably be expected to commute.

These latter two premiums\n\nare collectively referred to as the nightshift differential.\n\n    Con Ed argues that the regular rate should be\n\ncalculated using “a weighted average of the employee’s\n\nearnings at each rate of pay worked that week (i.e. basic\n\nrate, 8% nightshift . . . differential rate, or 10%\n\nnightshift differential rate).”     In other words, the regular\n\nrate should be derived from the total compensation paid to\n\nan employee in a given pay period divided by the number of\n\nhours worked; such a calculation naturally encompasses the\n\nnightshift differentials, if any, worked by the employee.8\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that “[t]here is no reason to\n\ndetermine a weighted average” because “pursuant to the CBA[,\n\nplaintiffs] are employed solely on the basis of a single\n\nhourly rate, which is their respective ‘regular rate.’”“\n\nPlaintiffs argue that this “single hourly rate” should be\n\n\n\n    8\n      The method Con Ed actually uses has more steps, but\nyields the same result as a more simple weighting\ncalculation. Con Ed’s method (1) calculates how much\nadditional money an employee earned as a result of the\nnighttime differentials; (2) divides that number by the\ntotal number of hours worked in the week; (3) multiplies\nthat number by the number of overtime hours worked in the\nweek; (4) it then divides that number in half (to account\nfor the time-and-a-half); and (5) compensates the employee\nby that additional increment.\n                             23\n\fthe 10% nightshift differential, regardless of the shift\n\nactually worked, by virtue of CBA Paragraph 13(b):\n\n“Assignment to Work Functions: Any employee assigned to\n\nperform any lower or lateral job or function, except\n\npursuant to a demotion, shall receive his regular rate of\n\npay while performing such work.”   We fail to see how this,\n\nor any other provision of the CBA supports plaintiffs’\n\nargument.9\n\n    This Court has already validated the weighted average\n\nmethod of determining the regular rate, which we described\n\nas “properly calculated by adding all of the wages payable\n\nfor the hours worked at the applicable shift rates and\n\ndividing by the total number of hours worked.”   Brock v.\n\n\n\n    9\n      The clear and unambiguous language of Paragraph 13(b)\nsimply provides that temporary reassignments that pay less\nwill not affect an employee’s actual compensation, unless\nthe reassignment was a result of a demotion.

That is, his\n         total earnings (except statutory exclusions) are\n         computed to include his compensation during the\n         workweek from all such rates, and are then divided\n         by the total number of hours worked at all jobs.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 778.115.11\n\n\n\n\n    10\n       In Brock, as here, pay for each of three shifts was\npaid at a different hourly rate. 833 F.2d at 13-14. For\novertime, the employer generally paid employees 150% of the\nday-shift rate (that being the lowest hourly rate paid for\nnon-overtime work). Id. In Brock, we rejected that pay in\nfavor of the weighted average method. Id. at 14.\n    11\n       As plaintiffs observe, the example used in this\nregulation assumes that the two rates of pay are a result of\ndifferent jobs, not nighttime differentials. But this\nobservation misapprehends the purpose of the regulation,\nwhich is simply to provide an example of a means of\ncalculating the regular rate. See 29 C.F.R. § 778.109 (“The\nfollowing sections give some examples of the proper method\nof determining the regular rate of pay in particular\ninstances . . . .” (emphasis added)).\n                             25\n\f    Finally, plaintiffs’ argument under the CBA succumbs to\n\nthe rule that “the regular rate of pay cannot be left to a\n\ndeclaration by the parties as to what is to be treated as\n\nthe regular rate for an employee[;] it must be drawn from\n\nwhat happens under the employment contract.”   Bay Ridge\n\nOperating Co. v.
