Navreet Nanda, Ph.D., brought this\ndiscrimination action against her former employer, the\nBoard of Trustees of the University of Illinois, as well as\nher former supervisors and colleagues at the University\n(collectively “the University”). The University moved to\ndismiss Dr. Nanda’s complaint, principally on the basis\nthat Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (“Title VII”), did not validly\nabrogate the State’s sovereign immunity under the Elev-\n\f2                                               No. 01-3448\n\nenth Amendment. The district court rejected this argument\nand held that Congress validly abrogated Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity when it extended Title VII to the States.\nFor the reasons set forth in the following opinion, we affirm\nthe judgment of the district court.\n\n\n                             I\n                     BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\n  Dr. Nanda was employed as an assistant professor in the\nDepartment of Microbiology at the University’s Chicago\ncampus. In July 1998, Bellur Prabhakar, the Chairman of\nthe Department of Microbiology and Immunology, recom-\nmended to the University that Dr. Nanda be issued a\nterminal contract that would end, at its expiration, her\nemployment with the University. The University accepted\nDr. Prabhakar’s recommendation and issued Dr. Nanda a\nterminal contract ending on August 31, 1999. Dr. Nanda’s\nefforts to reverse the decision through the University’s\ngrievance process were unsuccessful. After exhausting her\nadministrative remedies, Dr. Nanda filed this action in\ndistrict court.\n  Dr. Nanda’s complaint included three counts. In Count I,\nDr. Nanda alleged that she had suffered harassment and\nthat her employment had been terminated on the basis\nof her sex, race and national origin in violation of Title\nVII. Count II of Dr. Nanda’s complaint set forth a parallel\nclaim under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 for violations of\nher equal protection rights and sought injunctive relief,\ncompensatory damages and punitive damages against\nthe University as an institution and also her supervisors\nfor violations of her equal protection rights. Finally, Count\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                 3\n\nIII, a state tort law claim, alleged that Dr. Prabhakar had\ninterfered intentionally with Dr. Nanda’s employment\nrelationship with the University.\n   The University timely moved to dismiss Dr. Nanda’s\ncomplaint. With respect to Count I, the University main-\ntained that Congress did not abrogate properly the States’\nsovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment when\nit enacted the Equal Employment Act of 1972 (the “1972\nAct”) which extended Title VII’s coverage to the States. The\nindividual defendants and the University moved to dis-\nmiss Count II on the ground that the named administra-\ntors were not “persons” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. Finally, Dr. Prabhakar moved to dismiss Count III\non the ground that the pleaded state cause of action was\npreempted by a state statutory cause of action.\n  In her response, Dr. Nanda submitted that Congress had\nthe authority to extend Title VII to the States pursuant to\n§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, Dr. Nanda\nclaimed that Title VII passed the “congruence and propor-\ntionality” test articulated in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521\nU.S. 507 (1997), and its progeny. According to Dr. Nanda,\n“Title VII does not raise the level of scrutiny given to race,\nnational origin and gender classifications beyond that\ngranted in the Equal Protection Clause and, therefore, Title\nVII is congruent with the Equal Protection Clause.” R.58\nat 5. Furthermore, Dr. Nanda pointed to the historical prob-\nlems of race and gender discrimination, and to specific\nevidence of discrimination against women in institutions\nof higher education, to establish that Congress’ response\nto the problem of gender discrimination was proportion-\nate. See id. at 6-8.\n   With respect to Count II, Dr. Nanda contended that Count\nII of her complaint stated a claim under § 1983 because\nit alleged deliberate conduct for which she sought puni-\n\f4                                               No. 01-3448\n\ntive damages and because she sought injunctive relief\nwhich “may be granted under § 1983 without violating\nthe Eleventh Amendment.” Id. at 10. Finally, Dr. Nanda\nmaintained that her allegations against Dr. Prabhakar\nin Count III were distinguishable from her allegations of\ncivil rights violations made in the first two counts, and,\ntherefore, that count should be considered independent\nof those violations under Illinois tort law.\n\n\nB. District Court Opinion\n   After considering the arguments of the parties, the dis-\ntrict court granted in part and denied in part the Univer-\nsity’s motion. The district court acknowledged that, in\nseveral recent cases, the Supreme Court had held that\nCongress had encroached on the States’ Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity. However, with respect to whether Con-\ngress had abrogated properly the States’ Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity in enacting the 1972 Act, the court de-\ntermined that it was not “writ[ing] on a clean slate.” R.79\nat 3.\n  The district court began its analysis by stating that “[i]n\nFitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 447 (1976), the Supreme\nCourt concluded that in the 1972 Amendment to Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ‘Congress, acting un-\nder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, authorized federal\ncourts to award money damages . . . against a state\ngovernment . . . .’ ” R.79 at 3. Since that time, the court\ncontinued, numerous courts of appeals had permitted Title\nVII claims for damages against the States. The district\ncourt specifically mentioned and followed the decision of\nthe Eighth Circuit in Okruhlik v. University of Arkansas\nex rel. May, 255 F.3d 615 (8th Cir. 2001). In that case, the\nEighth Circuit concluded that Congress validly had abro-\ngated the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity when it\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                    5\n\nextended Title VII to the States. The district court, “per-\nsuaded by Okruhlik and the authorities cited therein, con-\nclude[d] that it may, consistent with the Constitution,\nexercise jurisdiction over Professor Nanda’s Title VII\nclaims.” R.79 at 6. It therefore denied the University’s mo-\ntion to dismiss Count I.\n  With respect to Count II, the district court held that,\nby virtue of the Supreme Court’s decision in Will v. Michi-\ngan Department of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989), “a\nlawsuit under § 1983 against state officials constitutes a\nsuit against the State itself, and that neither a State nor its\nofficials acting in their official capacities are ‘persons’ under\n§ 1983 for purposes of damage awards.” R.79 at 7. Con-\nsequently, the district court dismissed Dr. Nanda’s claims\nfor damages. However, because “the Court acknowledged\nin Will that a claim for injunctive relief may properly be\nbrought against state officials,” the district court allowed\nDr. Nanda’s claim for injunctive relief to go forward. Id.\n  Finally, the district court determined that Dr. Nanda’s\nclaim for intentional interference with contract contained\nin Count III was linked inextricably with the allegations\nthat Dr. Prabhakar’s actions were motived by sex, race\nand national origin. Therefore, the Illinois Human Rights\nAct provided the exclusive remedy for the alleged con-\nduct and preempted Dr. Nanda’s state tort claim. The\ncourt therefore granted Dr. Prabhakar’s motion to dis-\nmiss Count III.\n  The University timely appealed the district court’s denial\n                                          1\nof its motion to dismiss Counts I and II.\n\n\n\n1\n  Dr. Nanda did not cross-appeal the district court’s dismissal\nof Count III, and no arguments concerning Count III are before\nthis court.\n\f6                                                  No. 01-3448\n\n                               II\n                        DISCUSSION\nA. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, this court has jurisdiction only\nfrom “final decisions” of the district courts. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291; Cherry v. Univ. of Wis. Sys. Bd. of Regents, 265 F.3d\n541, 546 (7th Cir. 2001). This court has held that a district\ncourt’s denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final decision.\nSee United States v. Michelle’s Lounge, 39 F.3d 684, 702 (7th\nCir. 1994) (“Ordinarily, of course, a denial of a motion\nto dismiss is not a final order.”). However, the collateral\norder doctrine provides a “narrow” exception to the final-\nity rule. This doctrine permits an appeal from a non-final\njudgment, such as the denial of a motion to dismiss, when\nthe following criteria are met: (1) the order “conclusively\ndetermine[s] a disputed question”; (2) the order “resolve[s]\nan important issue completely separate from the merits\nof the action”; and (3) the order is “effectively unreview-\nable on appeal from a final judgment.” Coopers & Lybrand\nv. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468 (1978). It is well-settled that the\nissue of Eleventh Amendment immunity, which encom-\npasses both immunity from liability as well as immu-\nnity from suit, is “irretrievably lost” if not immediately ap-\npealable and therefore is properly raised in a collateral\nappeal. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf\n& Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147 (1993) (“We hold that\nStates and state entities that claim to be ‘arms of the State’\nmay take advantage of the collateral order doctrine to ap-\npeal a district court order denying a claim of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.”). Thus, we have jurisdiction to\nreview the district court’s denial of Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity.\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                 7\n\n   We review a district court’s decision to dismiss a claim\non Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds de novo.\nSee Cherry, 265 F.3d at 547. The University urges us to re-\nverse the district court’s decision on the Eleventh Amend-\nment issue and reiterates many of the arguments that\nit made in support of its motion to dismiss. Specifically,\nthe University contends that, when the Supreme Court\nhanded down its most recent Eleventh Amendment case,\nBoard of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531\nU.S. 356 (2001), the Court established a higher bar for\ncongressional abrogation of the States’ Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity. In the University’s view, in order to abro-\ngate properly Eleventh Amendment immunity, a Con-\ngressional enactment must not only pass the “congruence\nand proportionality” test, but also must be supported\nby clear evidence of past constitutional violations set forth\nin the legislative record. The district court, continues\nthe University, paid only lip service to this second re-\nquirement. The University contends that, because the\nlegislative record does not reveal a pattern of past con-\nstitutional wrongs to support the extension of Title VII to\nthe States, Title VII cannot survive an Eleventh Amendment\nchallenge.\n   Dr. Nanda, and the United States as intervenor, argue the\nopposite. According to these parties, federal courts only\nhave to look for a legislative record of constitutional\nviolations if the congressional action fails the “congruence\nand proportionality” test. In their view, because Title\nVII proscribes only unconstitutional behavior, the dis-\ntrict court did not have to examine the legislative record\nfor a history of constitutional violations. In the alterna-\ntive, Dr. Nanda and the United States maintain that, if\ncourts have to examine the legislative record to assess\nthe need for congressional action, there is ample evidence\n\f8                                                     No. 01-3448\n\nin the record to justify the extension of Title VII to the\n        2\nStates.\n  The Eleventh Amendment states: “The Judicial power of\nthe United States shall not be construed to extend to any\nsuit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against\none of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by\nCitizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” U.S. Const.\n\n\n\n2\n   The United States argues that Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445\n(1976), disposes of the issue currently before this court. In\nFitzpatrick, the Court determined that Congress, as part of its\npowers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, may “provide\nfor private suits against States or state officials which are\nconstitutionally impermissible in other contexts.” Id. at 456.\nAlthough many courts, including our own, see Merhab v. Ill. State\nToll Highway Auth., 267 F.3d 710, 711 (7th Cir. 2001) (citing\nFitzpatrick for proposition that “there is no Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity to suits under Title VII”); Love v. Waukesha Joint\nSch. Dist. #1, Bd. of Educ., 560 F.2d 285 (7th Cir. 1977), took\nFitzpatrick to resolve all Eleventh Amendment challenges to\nTitle VII, the decision did hold open the possibility of an Elev-\nenth Amendment challenge to Title VII based on Congress’\nauthority under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment; it stated:\n“Apart from their claim that the Eleventh Amendment bars\nenforcement of the remedy established by Title VII in this\ncase, respondent state officials do not contend that the substan-\ntive provisions of Title VII as applied here are not a proper ex-\nercise of congressional authority under § 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.” Fitzpatrick, 427 U.S. at 456 n.11. The combination\nof this possibility with the detailed Eleventh Amendment anal-\nysis the Court has employed in recent cases suggests to us\nthat the most prudent course is to assume that neither Fitz-\npatrick nor our earlier summary treatment of the issue through\nreliance on Fitzpatrick necessarily disposes of the issue currently\nbefore us.\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                        9\n            3\namend. XI. A state’s immunity, however, is not absolute;\n“Congress may abrogate the State’s Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so\nand acts pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional au-\nthority.” Garrett, 531 U.S. at 363 (internal quotation marks\n                          4\nand citations omitted). The Supreme Court has recog-\nnized that “the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of\nstate sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily lim-\nited by the enforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.” Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 456 (1976)\n(internal citations omitted). Congress, therefore, “may sub-\nject nonconsenting States to suit in federal court when it\ndoes so pursuant to a valid exercise of its § 5 power.”\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 364. We must ascertain, therefore, what\nconstitutes a valid exercise of § 5 power to determine\nif Congress’ extension of Title VII to the States falls with-\nin that grant of authority.\n    The Fourteenth Amendment states, in relevant part:\n     Section 1. . . . No State shall make or enforce any law\n     which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of\n     citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive\n\n\n3\n   Although the text of the Amendment does not forbid suits\nagainst a State by its own citizens, “the sovereign immunity\nenjoyed by the States extends beyond the literal text of the\nEleventh Amendment.” Fed. Mar. Comm’n v. South Carolina State\nPorts Auth., 122 S. Ct. 1864, 1871 (2002). Specifically, the Su-\npreme Court “has consistently held that an unconsenting State\nis immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own\ncitizens as well as by citizens of another State.” Edelman v. Jordan,\n415 U.S. 651, 662-63 (1974) (citing cases).\n4\n  The University does not dispute that Congress unequivocally\nintended to abrogate the States’ Eleventh Amendment immu-\nnity when it passed the 1972 Act.\n\f10                                               No. 01-3448\n\n     any person of life, liberty, or property, without due\n     process of law; nor deny to any person within its\n     jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.\n     ....\n     Section 5. The Congress shall have the power to en-\n     force, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this\n     article.\nU.S. Const. amend. XIV. Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment gives to Congress the right to “enforce the substan-\ntive guarantees contained in § 1 by enacting ‘appropriate\nlegislation.’ ” Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365. This Congressional\ndetermination of necessity and propriety is “entitled to\nmuch deference.” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 536\n(1997). Nevertheless, Congress’ power is limited to en-\nforcement; the Fourteenth Amendment does not give\nCongress the power “to determine what constitutes a\nconstitutional violation,” City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519, a\nresponsibility reserved to the Court, see Garrett, 531 U.S.\nat 365.\n  A review of the Supreme Court’s § 5 jurisprudence and\nour own court’s implementation of these principles is\nhelpful in drawing this distinction between enforcing\nand redefining the protections of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.\n\n\n  1. Supreme Court Precedent\n  Through a recent line of cases, the Court has articulated\nwhat constitutes a proper exercise of the Fourteenth\nAmendment enforcement power vis a vis the Eleventh\nAmendment. We begin our review with City of Boerne v.\nFlores.\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                 11\n\n    a. City of Boerne\n   In City of Boerne, the Court considered the constitution-\nality of the Religious Freedom Recovery Act (“RFRA”),\nspecifically whether Congress, in enacting RFRA, properly\nhad exercised its enforcement power under § 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. The Court first “acknowledge[d]\nthat § 5 is a ‘positive grant of legislative power to Con-\ngress.’ ” Id. at 517 (quoting Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S.\n641, 651 (1966)). “Legislation which deters or remedies\nconstitutional violations can fall within the sweep of Con-\ngress’ enforcement power even if in the process it prohib-\nits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and in-\ntrudes into ‘legislative spheres of autonomy previously\nreserved to the states.’ ” Id. at 518. However broad Con-\ngress’ power under § 5, the Court continued, it is not\nunlimited. The Court explained that “[t]he design of the\nAmendment and the text of § 5 are inconsistent with the\nsuggestion that Congress has the power to decree the\nsubstance of the Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on\nthe States.” Id. at 519. Congress is limited to “enforcing” the\nrights guaranteed by the Amendment. Id. The Court recog-\nnized that\n    [w]hile the line between measures that remedy or\n    prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that\n    make a substantive change in the governing law is\n    not easy to discern, and Congress must have wide\n    latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction\n    exists and must be observed. There must be a congru-\n    ence and proportionality between the injury to be\n    prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that\n    end.\nId. at 519-20.\n  The Court then examined the provisions of RFRA to\ndetermine if it was a valid exercise of Congress’ § 5 powers.\n\f12                                               No. 01-3448\n\nThe parties presented RFRA as a measure to “prevent[]\nand remed[y] laws which are enacted with the unconsti-\ntutional object of targeting religious beliefs and practices.”\nId. at 529. The Court stated that “[t]he appropriateness\nof remedial measures must be considered in light of the\nevil presented. Strong measures appropriate to address\none harm may be an unwarranted response to another,\nlesser one.” Id. at 530 (citing South Carolina v. Katzenbach,\n383 U.S. 301, 308 (1966)). According to the Court, RFRA’s\nlegislative record lacked examples of instances in which\nlaws of general applicability were enacted by the States\nfor the purpose of inflicting religious discrimination.\nRather, congressional hearings had focused on laws of\ngeneral applicability that placed only incidental burdens\non religion. The lack of a legislative record, however,\nwas not dispositive. The Court stated that\n     [r]egardless of the state of the legislative record, RFRA\n     cannot be considered remedial, preventive legisla-\n     tion, if those terms are to have any meaning. RFRA is\n     so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preven-\n     tive object that it cannot be understood as responsive\n     to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\nId. at 532. Consequently, RFRA could not stand in the face\nof the Eleventh Amendment challenge.\n\n\n     b. Florida Prepaid\n  The Court next addressed the interplay of the Eleventh\nand Fourteenth Amendments in Florida Prepaid Post Second-\nary Education Examination Board v. College Savings Bank,\n527 U.S. 627 (1999). In that case, the Court addressed an\nEleventh Amendment challenge to the Patent and Plant\nVariety Protection Remedy Clarification Act (the “Patent\nRemedy Act”), which allowed patent holders to pursue\n\fNo. 01-3448                                               13\n\ninfringement actions against the States. In assessing the\nvalidity of the congressional action, the Court reiterated\nthe requirements of congruence and proportionality estab-\nlished in City of Boerne:\n    We . . . held that for Congress to invoke § 5, it must\n    identify conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amend-\n    ment’s substantive provisions, and must tailor its\n    legislative scheme to remedying or preventing such\n    conduct.\n      RFRA failed to meet this test because there was little\n    support in the record for the concerns that animated\n    the law.\nId. at 639.\n  Following this course, the Court first identified the\nFourteenth Amendment “evil” or “wrong” that Congress\nintended to remedy “ ‘with reference to the historical ex-\nperience . . . it reflects.’ ” Id. at 639-40 (quoting City of\nBoerne, 521 U.S. at 525). In Florida Prepaid, as in City of\nBoerne, the Court was unable to identify a pattern of con-\nstitutional wrongs by the States against patent holders. The\nCourt went on to state that, although the “lack of support\nin the legislative record is not determinative,” id. at 646,\nidentifying and assessing “the wrong or evil is still a crit-\nical part of our § 5 calculus because ‘[s]trong measures\nappropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted\nresponse to another, lesser one,’ ” id. (quoting City of\nBoerne, 521 U.S. at 530). When there is little evidence of\nconstitutional harm in the legislative record, the means of\ncombatting the feared unconstitutional action must be\ntailored to address clear constitutional violations. Because\nthe Patent Remedy Act offended this principle of propor-\ntionality, the Court held that it was not a valid exercise\nof Congress’ § 5 powers.\n\f14                                               No. 01-3448\n\n     c. Kimel\n   The Age Discrimination in Employment Act was the\nnext Congressional enactment to meet with an Eleventh\nAmendment challenge. In Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents,\n528 U.S. 62 (2000), the Court addressed the issue of wheth-\ner Congress validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment im-\nmunity in the ADEA. The Court reiterated the breadth of\ncongressional power pursuant to the Fourteenth Amend-\nment: “Congress’ power ‘to enforce’ the Amendment in-\ncludes the authority both to remedy and to deter viola-\ntion of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a\nsomewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which\nis not itself forbidden by the Amendment’s text.” Id. at 81.\nHowever, applying its now-established congruence and\nproportionality requirements, see id. at 82, the Court held\nthat “the ADEA is not ‘appropriate legislation’ under § 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 82-83. Initially, the\nCourt observed that, because age discrimination is sub-\nject only to rational basis review under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause, only irrational age classifications violate the\nConstitution. “Judged against the backdrop of our equal\nprotection jurisprudence [on age discrimination],” the Court\nstated, “it is clear that the ADEA is ‘so out of proportion\nto a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot\nbe understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent un-\nconstitutional behavior.’ ” Id. at 86 (quoting City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 532). However, “[t]hat the ADEA prohibits\nvery little conduct likely to be held unconstitutional, while\nsignificant, d[id] not alone provide the answer to [the] § 5\ninquiry.” Id. at 88. The Court’s task was to discern whether\nthe ADEA was proper prophylactic legislation or an at-\ntempt by Congress “to substantively redefine the States’\nlegal obligations with respect to age discrimination,” and\none means to make such a determination was to examine\nthe legislative record. Id. To the Court, this review con-\n\fNo. 01-3448                                               15\n\nfirmed that Congress’ extension of the ADEA to the\nStates “was an unwarranted response to a perhaps inconse-\nquential problem.” Id. at 89. According to the Court,\n    Congress never identified any pattern of age discrim-\n    ination by the States, much less any discrimination\n    whatsoever that rose to the level of constitutional\n    violation. The evidence compiled by petitioners to\n    demonstrate such attention by Congress to age dis-\n    crimination by the States falls well short of the mark.\n    That evidence consists almost entirely of isolated sen-\n    tences clipped from floor debates and legislative re-\n    ports.\nId. Looking back to its decision in City of Boerne, the Court\nheld that, although this lack of support in the legisla-\ntive record was not determinative, “Congress’ failure to\nuncover any significant pattern of unconstitutional discrimi-\nnation here confirms that Congress had no reason to be-\nlieve that broad prophylactic legislation was necessary in\nthis field.” Id. at 91. The Court then concluded that, “[i]n\nlight of the indiscriminate scope of the Act’s substan-\ntive requirements, and the lack of evidence of widespread\nand unconstitutional age discrimination by the States, we\nhold that the ADEA is not a valid exercise of Congress’\npower under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id.\n\n\n    d. Garrett\n   Finally, in Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama\nv. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), the Court considered an\nEleventh Amendment challenge to the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”). Again, the Court’s task was to\ndetermine whether the ADA was proper enforcement leg-\nislation, as opposed to a usurpation of the Court’s respon-\nsibility “to define the substance of constitutional guaran-\n\f16                                              No. 01-3448\n\ntees.” Id. at 365. “Accordingly,” stated the Court, “§ 5\nlegislation reaching beyond the scope of § 1’s actual guaran-\ntees must exhibit ‘congruence and proportionality between\nthe injury to be prevented or remedied and the means\nadopted to that end.’ ” Id. (quoting City of Boerne, 521 U.S.\nat 520). The Court’s first step in this analysis was to iden-\ntify the scope of the constitutional right at issue. It noted\nthat the Equal Protection clause affords only rational\nbasis review for disability discrimination. Once the Court\ndetermined “the metes and bounds of the constitutional\nright in question, [it] examine[d] whether Congress identi-\nfied a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment\ndiscrimination by the States against the disabled.” Id. at\n368. It noted that “Congress’ § 5 authority is appropriately\nexercised only in response to state transgressions.” Id.\nHowever, the legislative record of the ADA, the Court\nnoted, focused heavily on the private sector. Few ex-\namples from the record involved the States, and the Court\nfound it “debatable” whether these incidents evidenced\n“irrational” state action or merely “an unwillingness on\nthe part of state officials to make the sort of accommoda-\ntions for the disabled required by the ADA.” Id. at 370.\nHowever, the Court held that, even if each incident\nshowed unconstitutional action on the part of the State,\n“these incidents taken together fall far short of even sug-\ngesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on\nwhich § 5 legislation must be based,” id., and thus the\nADA “raise[d] the same sort of concerns as to congruence\nand proportionality as were found in City of Boerne,” id. at\n372. “[I]n order to authorize private individuals to recover\nmoney damages against the States,” the Court stated, “there\nmust be a pattern of discrimination by the States which\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment, and the remedy im-\nposed by Congress must be congruent and proportional\nto the targeted violation.” Id. at 374. With respect to the\nADA, those requirements had not been met. See id.\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                 17\n\n   Although articulated and ordered slightly differently\nwithin each case, we believe that these cases identify sev-\neral guiding principles that must inform our Eleventh\nAmendment analysis. First, congressional action taken\npursuant to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment is not lim-\nited to parroting the language of § 1. Section 5 is a positive\ngrant of power, and Congress may enact reasonable pro-\nphylactic legislation in the face of constitutional violations.\n  However, Congress’ enforcement power must stop\nshort of redefining the States’ substantive obligations\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether a particular\ncongressional response enforces, as opposed to defines,\nthe States’ obligations under § 1 of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment is determined by looking at the scope of the enact-\nment compared with the constitutional right being pro-\ntected. If the scope of the remedy is broad, it must be\njustified by a proportionately pressing need. Finally, al-\nthough legislative history is not determinative of this\ninquiry, it is one means—and perhaps the most telling\nmeans—of assessing the depth of the constitutional prob-\nlem and the consequent need for a congressional remedy.\n\n\n  2. Circuit Precedent\n   This court has applied the principles set forth above in\nconsidering two Eleventh Amendment challenges to the\nEqual Pay Act. In Varner v. Illinois State University, 226\nF.3d 927 (7th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 533 U.S. 902 (2001),\nthis court followed the analysis set forth by the Supreme\nCourt in City of Boerne and its progeny, and first looked\nat the conduct targeted by the Equal Pay Act. We acknowl-\nedged that, in light of the burden-shifting provisions of the\nEqual Pay Act, “an employer is potentially subject to\nliability without a showing of discriminatory intent”—a\n\f18                                              No. 01-3448\n\nprerequisite for a constitutional violation. Id. at 932. How-\never, we noted, based on the Court’s rulings, the fact\nthat the Equal Pay Act prohibited some constitutional\nconduct did not end the inquiry: “The question before us,\ntherefore, is not whether the remedial provisions of the\nEqual Pay Act prohibit some constitutional conduct.\nInstead, we must consider whether the Act can be char-\nacterized as a proportional and congruent response to\nthe problem of unconstitutional wage discrimination\nbased on gender.” Id. at 933.\n  In applying the principles of congruence and propor-\ntionality, we noted three distinctions between the Equal Pay\nAct and the legislative provisions that the Court had\nstruck down. First, the Equal Pay Act was “less indis-\ncriminate in scope” than those acts, id.; it contained ex-\nemptions from liability for employers “who can provide\na neutral explanation for a disparity in pay,” id. at 934.\nFurthermore, the Equal Pay Act addressed a problem—\ngender discrimination—which was subject to heightened\nscrutiny under the Constitution. Finally, Congress had\ngained an historical understanding of the problem of gen-\nder discrimination through other legislation. All of these\nconsiderations militated against a finding that Congress\nhad acted to redefine the States’ obligations under the\nEqual Protection Clause as opposed to simply enforcing\nthe already stringent requirements on the States.\n  In upholding the Equal Pay Act against the Eleventh\nAmendment challenge, we rejected the view that explicit\nlegislative findings were a necessary element of the § 5\ninquiry. In Varner, the University had urged that, because\n“the legislative findings underlying the Equal Pay Act\naddress only the problem of discrimination in private\nindustry,” there was no record to justify extension of\nthe Equal Pay Act to public employers. Id. at 935. We stated:\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                  19\n\n    Although we recognize that a review of the legislative\n    record can be an instructive means of distinguish-\n    ing appropriate remedial action from an impermis-\n    sible substantive change in legal rights, we want to\n    emphasize that a “lack of support [in the legislative\n    record] is not determinative of the § 5 inquiry.” This\n    observation is particularly relevant in the context of\n    the Equal Pay Act, where the value of congressional\n    findings is greatly diminished by the fact that the Act\n    prohibits very little constitutional conduct and where\n    the historical record clearly demonstrates that gender\n    discrimination is a problem that is national in scope.\nId. (quoting Kimel, 528 U.S. at 91; internal citations omitted).\nConsequently, we determined that subjecting state enti-\nties to liability under the Equal Pay Act did not violate the\nEleventh Amendment.\n  Shortly thereafter, we revisited our decision in Varner\nin light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Garrett. See\nCherry v. Univ. of Wis. Sys. Bd. of Regents, 265 F.3d 541 (7th\nCir. 2001). We restated the governing standard as follows:\n    Congress can enact legislation to remedy or prevent\n    conduct that violates the Fourteenth Amendment, but\n    Congress cannot redefine or expand the substance of\n    the Fourteenth Amendment itself. Thus there must be\n    a congruence and proportionality between the injury to\n    be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to\n    that end. This means that Congress must carefully\n    tailor its legislation so that it enforces the Fourteenth\n    Amendment without altering the Amendment’s mean-\n    ing.\nId. at 549 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nWe then examined the scope of the Equal Pay Act to\ndetermine whether it was consistent and compatible with\n\f20                                                 No. 01-3448\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment or whether it expanded the\nsubstantive prohibitions of the Amendment by prohibit-\ning more state action than would be unconstitutional.\nAs part of this analysis, we examined the legislative rec-\nord to assess whether Congress had identified a pattern of\nunconstitutional conduct by the States. Noting that the\nCourt had advised that this evidence “is not determinative\nof the § 5 inquiry,” we stated that “[s]uch evidence tends to\nensure that Congress’ means are appropriate under § 5\nwhen the statute in question pervasively prohibits consti-\ntutional State action.” Id. at 549 (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted). We dismissed the argument that\nGarrett\n     established a new, bright-line rule that Congress’\n     attempt to abrogate immunity from a federal statute\n     is invalid if the statute lacks specific findings that\n     the States had engaged in a pattern of unconstitu-\n     tional conduct of the type prohibited by the statute. . . .\n     All Garrett does is further demonstrate that the legisla-\n     tive record is an important factor when the statute in\n     question pervasively prohibits constitutional State\n     action.\nId. at 553. Consequently, again we sustained the Equal Pay\nAct as it applied to the States.\n\n\n  3. Application\n  As detailed above, in determining whether Congress\noverstepped its constitutional authority in applying Title VII\nto the States, we must “identify with some precision the\nscope of the constitutional right at issue,” here the limita-\ntions that § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment places upon\nStates’ treatment of women and of ethnic and racial minori-\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                      21\n\nties. Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365. We explained this level of\nprotection in Varner:\n    Under the Constitution, gender-based classifications\n    are afforded heightened scrutiny. Once an individual is\n    able to establish the existence of a gender-based dis-\n    tinction, “[p]arties who seek to defend gender-based\n    government action must demonstrate an ‘exceedingly\n    persuasive justification’ for that action.”\n226 F.3d at 934 (quoting United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S.\n                                              5\n515, 531 (1996); internal citations omitted). In the em-\nployment context, courts have given effect to this consti-\ntutional prohibition by allowing plaintiffs to prove their\ncase using the familiar construct of a prima facie case; this\ncourt has stated:\n      Although as an original matter it seems odd that the\n    pleading and proof of liability in a case under the\n    Constitution would be the same as in a case under a\n    statute passed in 1964, this is indeed the teaching of an\n    unbroken phalanx of decisions by this and other courts.\n    These cases hold that the issue of liability and the\n    method of proving liability are the same, though only\n    in a disparate-treatment case . . . .\nRiordan v. Kempiners, 831 F.2d 690, 695-96 (7th Cir. 1987).\nThus, “all that is required to establish prima facie liability,\nand thus allow the plaintiff to get to the jury, is evidence\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny—they must\npromote a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored\nto serve that interest. See Billings v. Madison Met. Sch. Dist., 259\nF.3d 807, 815 (7th Cir. 2001).\n\f22                                                 No. 01-3448\n                               [6]\nof a disparity in treatment between equally qualified\nworkers of different sexes, from which discriminatory intent\ncan be inferred.” Id. at 695; see also Johnson v. Chapel Hill\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 853 F.2d 375, 381 (5th Cir. 1988) (“A plain-\ntiff proceeding on a disparate treatment theory of employ-\nment discrimination must show disparate treatment and\ndiscriminatory motive. A plaintiff can establish a prima\nfacie case, however, by producing evidence of disparate\ntreatment alone.” (internal citations omitted)).\n  The Supreme Court also has instructed us to evaluate\nthe scope of the congressional action at issue to determine\nto what extent, if any, the act prohibits conduct allowed\nby the Constitution. At issue here is the disparate treat-\nment prohibition of Title VII. It states in relevant part:\n     It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n     employer—\n        (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n        individual, or otherwise to discriminate against\n        any individual with respect to his compensation,\n        terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n        because of such individual’s race, color, religion,\n        sex, or national origin; or\n\n\n6\n  The allegations in Dr. Nanda’s complaint are limited to claims\nof intentional discrimination, i.e., disparate treatment. Because\nDr. Nanda’s claims are disparate treatment claims, and because\nthe University does not contend that Title VII’s disparate im-\npact provisions should factor into the Eleventh Amendment\ncalculus, we limit our review to Title VII’s disparate treatment\nprovisions. Cf. In re: Employment Discrimination Litig. Against\nthe State of Ala., 198 F.3d 1305 (11th Cir. 1999) (considering\nEleventh Amendment challenge to disparate impact provision of\nTitle VII without consideration of the disparate treatment pro-\nvision).\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                   23\n\n        (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n        or applicants for employment in any way which\n        would deprive or tend to deprive any individual\n        of employment opportunities or otherwise ad-\n        versely affect his status as an employee, because\n        of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex or\n        national origin.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Like the prohibition of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this language is aimed at intentional\ndiscrimination, and “[t]o prove a violation of this provi-\nsion, a plaintiff must proffer either direct or indirect evi-\ndence of the employer’s discriminatory intent.” Bennett v.\nRoberts, 295 F.3d 687, 694 (7th Cir. 2002). When using\nthe indirect method, the plaintiff establishes a prima facie\ncase of discriminatory intent by showing: (1) that she\nbelongs to a protected category; (2) that she suffered an\nadverse employment action; (3) that she was meeting\nher employer’s legitimate expectations; and (4) similarly\nsituated individuals not in a protected category were treated\nmore favorably by the employer. See, e.g., Maarouf v. Walker\nMfg. Co., 210 F.3d 750, 752 (7th Cir. 2000). Thus, both the\naim of Title VII, as well as the method for proving viola-\ntions of Title VII, are the same as those of the Equal Protec-\n             7\ntion Clause.\n\n\n7\n   Both Dr. Nanda and the Government argue that Title VII does\nnot prohibit any constitutional conduct because the burdens of\nproof on employers is the same under both the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause and Title VII. The University responds to this argu-\nment accordingly:\n    The substantive provisions of Title VII were enacted in 1964,\n    not in 1972, and the States at that time were expressly\n    excluded from coverage because of sovereign immunity. If\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f24                                                    No. 01-3448\n\n  A review of the standards of the Equal Protection Clause\nand of Title VII reveals that Title VII “enforces the Four-\nteenth Amendment without altering its meaning.” Cherry,\n265 F.3d at 549. The fact that Congress was not attempt-\ning to “redefine” the Fourteenth Amendment in extend-\ning Title VII to the States is also clear from the legislative\nrecord. In undertaking a review of the legislative record,\nwe are cognizant of the Court’s instruction that “lack of\nsupport [in the legislative record] is not determinative of\nthe § 5 inquiry,” Kimel, 528 U.S. at 91, and we recognize\nthat “the value of congressional findings is greatly dimin-\nished” by the fact that the disparate treatment provisions\nof Title VII prohibit little, if any, constitutional conduct,\nVarner, 226 F.3d at 935.\n\n\n\n7\n    (...continued)\n       the court were to accept the argument of Nanda and the\n       United States, the court would be required to conclude\n       that since, in 1964, the Title VII protections were identical\n       to the protections of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment\n       they were at that time, by definition, congruent and propor-\n       tional and that, abrogation, without more, occurred. The\n       court would then have to conclude that in 1964, Congress,\n       when it enacted Title VII, abrogated the States’ immunity\n       and at the same time expressly excluded the States from Title\n       VII’s coverage, an absurd conclusion.\nReply Br. at 1-2. This response, we believe, lacks both logic and\npersuasiveness. The substantive provisions of Title VII did not\nchange between 1964 and 1972; the 1972 amendment mere-\nly extended Title VII to the States. It is perfectly appropriate,\ntherefore, in applying principles of congruence and proportional-\nity, to compare the substantive provisions of Title VII, as ex-\ntended to the States in 1972, to the limitations placed on the\nStates by the Equal Protection Clause.\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                25\n\n   In the present case, the legislative record confirms that\nCongress was responding to a pattern of discrimination\nby the States. The legislative history shows that Congress\nrelied upon and adopted two comprehensive studies of\nracial and national origin discrimination to support its\nproposed legislation. See H.R. Rep. No. 92-238, at 17 (1971).\nThe first of these “indicate[d] that widespread discrim-\nination against minorities exist[ed] in State and local\ngovernment employment . . . .” Id. The legislative record\nalso specifically addresses the problem of racial and gen-\nder discrimination in academia. See id. at 19-20. Finally,\nstatistical evidence bolstered Congress’ view that “there\nexist[ed] a profound economic discrimination against\nwomen workers” across all fields, and, consequently, leg-\nislation was needed to strengthen and broaden federal\nadministrative procedures for combatting this discrimina-\ntion. Id. at 4.\n  Not only did Congress document the need for additional\nlegislation protecting minority and women workers em-\nployed by the states, local governments, and specifically\neducational institutions, Congress had become familiar with\nthe problems of race and national origin discrimination\nin the public and private sector in enacting the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and with the problems of gender\ndiscrimination in considering the Equal Rights Amendment\nand the Educational Opportunity Act, see Okruhlik v.\nUniv. of Ark. ex rel. May, 255 F.3d 615, 625 (8th Cir. 2001).\nSuch familiarity “ ‘reduce[s] the need for fresh hearings\nand prolonged debates.’ ” Id. (quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick,\n448 U.S. 448, 503 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring)). As we\nconcluded in Varner, “[w]e believe that this evidence is\nsufficient to support the limited action taken by Congress\nin its passage of [the 1972 Act], particularly given the well-\ndocumented history of gender [and race] discrimina-\ntion in this Nation, a history that is embodied in the Su-\n\f26                                                   No. 01-3448\n\npreme Court’s own jurisprudence.” Varner, 226 F.3d at\n935-36.\n  We are not alone in concluding that Congress validly\nabrogated the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity in\npassing the 1972 Act. In Okruhlik, the Eighth Circuit also\nrejected an Eleventh Amendment challenge to Title VII.\nFollowing the guidelines of the Supreme Court, that cir-\ncuit looked at the legislative history where it found “much\nsupport” for Congress’ action. Okruhlik, 255 F.3d at 624.\nAs well, it compared the scope of the employer’s responsi-\nbility under Title VII to its responsibility under the Equal\nProtection Clause and noted that “the elements of a claim\nof intentional discrimination are essentially the same un-\nder Title VII and the Constitution.” Id. at 626. Any dif-\nferences between the two protections, either by way of\n                     8\nremedies or scope, were “proportional and congruent”\nresponses to a pattern of unconstitutional state action. Id.\n  Because the disparate treatment provision of Title VII\nprohibits little if any constitutional behavior and because\nCongress was acting on a solid evidentiary ground in ex-\ntending Title VII to the States, we hold that the 1972 Act\nvalidly abrogated the States’ Eleventh Amendment im-\nmunity with respect to Title VII disparate treatment claims.\n\n\nB. Prayer for Injunctive Relief in Count II\n  The University also challenges the district court’s failure\nto dismiss Dr. Nanda’s claims for injunctive relief pursuant\n\n\n8\n  The Eighth Circuit considered the effect of Title VII’s disparate\nimpact provisions as well as Title VII’s disparate treatment\nprovision. See Okruhlik v. Univ. of Ark. ex rel. May, 255 F.3d 615,\n626 (8th Cir. 2001).\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                   27\n\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The University and its officials con-\ntend that the district court erred when it let stand Dr.\nNanda’s request in Count II for injunctive relief against\nthe University officials in their official capacities. Because\nthe requested relief of reinstatement can be granted only\nby the University acting through its trustees, the defen-\ndants contend that this request is appropriately character-\nized as a request for injunctive relief against the Univer-\nsity. The University, they continue, is protected by the\nEleventh Amendment from such relief. Before we address\nthe merits of this claim, we must first consider whether we\n                                                          9\nhave jurisdiction to entertain this aspect of the appeal.\n  We believe that we have jurisdiction over this conten-\ntion for the same reason that we have jurisdiction over\nthe earlier contention concerning the applicability of the\nEleventh Amendment to a suit under Title VII. In essence,\nthe defendants are claiming that the Eleventh Amend-\nment provides them with a shield from litigating this\nclaim.

Navreet Nanda, Ph.D., brought this\ndiscrimination action against her former employer, the\nBoard of Trustees of the University of Illinois, as well as\nher former supervisors and colleagues at the University\n(collectively “the University”). The University moved to\ndismiss Dr. Nanda’s complaint, principally on the basis\nthat Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (“Title VII”), did not validly\nabrogate the State’s sovereign immunity under the Elev-\n\f2                                               No. 01-3448\n\nenth Amendment. The district court rejected this argument\nand held that Congress validly abrogated Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity when it extended Title VII to the States.\nFor the reasons set forth in the following opinion, we affirm\nthe judgment of the district court.\n\n\n                             I\n                     BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\n  Dr. Nanda was employed as an assistant professor in the\nDepartment of Microbiology at the University’s Chicago\ncampus. In July 1998, Bellur Prabhakar, the Chairman of\nthe Department of Microbiology and Immunology, recom-\nmended to the University that Dr. Nanda be issued a\nterminal contract that would end, at its expiration, her\nemployment with the University. The University accepted\nDr. Prabhakar’s recommendation and issued Dr. Nanda a\nterminal contract ending on August 31, 1999. Dr. Nanda’s\nefforts to reverse the decision through the University’s\ngrievance process were unsuccessful. After exhausting her\nadministrative remedies, Dr. Nanda filed this action in\ndistrict court.\n  Dr. Nanda’s complaint included three counts. In Count I,\nDr. Nanda alleged that she had suffered harassment and\nthat her employment had been terminated on the basis\nof her sex, race and national origin in violation of Title\nVII. Count II of Dr. Nanda’s complaint set forth a parallel\nclaim under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 for violations of\nher equal protection rights and sought injunctive relief,\ncompensatory damages and punitive damages against\nthe University as an institution and also her supervisors\nfor violations of her equal protection rights. Finally, Count\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                 3\n\nIII, a state tort law claim, alleged that Dr. Prabhakar had\ninterfered intentionally with Dr. Nanda’s employment\nrelationship with the University.\n   The University timely moved to dismiss Dr. Nanda’s\ncomplaint. With respect to Count I, the University main-\ntained that Congress did not abrogate properly the States’\nsovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment when\nit enacted the Equal Employment Act of 1972 (the “1972\nAct”) which extended Title VII’s coverage to the States. The\nindividual defendants and the University moved to dis-\nmiss Count II on the ground that the named administra-\ntors were not “persons” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. Finally, Dr. Prabhakar moved to dismiss Count III\non the ground that the pleaded state cause of action was\npreempted by a state statutory cause of action.\n  In her response, Dr. Nanda submitted that Congress had\nthe authority to extend Title VII to the States pursuant to\n§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, Dr. Nanda\nclaimed that Title VII passed the “congruence and propor-\ntionality” test articulated in City of Boerne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118140\"><a href=\"/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997), and its progeny. According to Dr. Nanda,\n“Title VII does not raise the level of scrutiny given to race,\nnational origin and gender classifications beyond that\ngranted in the Equal Protection Clause and, therefore, Title\nVII is congruent with the Equal Protection Clause.” R.58\nat 5. Furthermore, Dr. Nanda pointed to the historical prob-\nlems of race and gender discrimination, and to specific\nevidence of discrimination against women in institutions\nof higher education, to establish that Congress’ response\nto the problem of gender discrimination was proportion-\nate. See id. at 6-8.\n   With respect to Count II, Dr. Nanda contended that Count\nII of her complaint stated a claim under § 1983 because\nit alleged deliberate conduct for which she sought puni-\n\f4                                               No. 01-3448\n\ntive damages and because she sought injunctive relief\nwhich “may be granted under § 1983 without violating\nthe Eleventh Amendment.” Id. at 10. Finally, Dr. Nanda\nmaintained that her allegations against Dr. Prabhakar\nin Count III were distinguishable from her allegations of\ncivil rights violations made in the first two counts, and,\ntherefore, that count should be considered independent\nof those violations under Illinois tort law.\n\n\nB. District Court Opinion\n   After considering the arguments of the parties, the dis-\ntrict court granted in part and denied in part the Univer-\nsity’s motion. The district court acknowledged that, in\nseveral recent cases, the Supreme Court had held that\nCongress had encroached on the States’ Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity. However, with respect to whether Con-\ngress had abrogated properly the States’ Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity in enacting the 1972 Act, the court de-\ntermined that it was not “writ[ing] on a clean slate.” R.79\nat 3.\n  The district court began its analysis by stating that “[i]n\nFitzpatrick v. Bitzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109520\"><a href=\"/opinion/109520/fitzpatrick-v-bitzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447 (1976), the Supreme\nCourt concluded that in the 1972 Amendment to Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ‘Congress, acting un-\nder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, authorized federal\ncourts to award money damages . . . against a state\ngovernment . . . .’ ” R.79 at 3. Since that time, the court\ncontinued, numerous courts of appeals had permitted Title\nVII claims for damages against the States. The district\ncourt specifically mentioned and followed the decision of\nthe Eighth Circuit in Okruhlik v. University of Arkansas\nex rel. May, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773856\"><a href=\"/opinion/773856/gwenn-okruhlik-united-states-intervenor-on-appeal-v-the-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 2001). In that case, the\nEighth Circuit concluded that Congress validly had abro-\ngated the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity when it\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                    5\n\nextended Title VII to the States. The district court, “per-\nsuaded by Okruhlik and the authorities cited therein, con-\nclude[d] that it may, consistent with the Constitution,\nexercise jurisdiction over Professor Nanda’s Title VII\nclaims.” R.79 at 6. It therefore denied the University’s mo-\ntion to dismiss Count I.\n  With respect to Count II, the district court held that,\nby virtue of the Supreme Court’s decision in Will v. Michi-\ngan Department of State Police, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112293\"><a href=\"/opinion/112293/will-v-michigan-dept-of-state-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1989), “a\nlawsuit under § 1983 against state officials constitutes a\nsuit against the State itself, and that neither a State nor its\nofficials acting in their official capacities are ‘persons’ under\n§ 1983 for purposes of damage awards.” R.79 at 7. Con-\nsequently, the district court dismissed Dr. Nanda’s claims\nfor damages. However, because “the Court acknowledged\nin Will that a claim for injunctive relief may properly be\nbrought against state officials,” the district court allowed\nDr. Nanda’s claim for injunctive relief to go forward. Id.\n  Finally, the district court determined that Dr. Nanda’s\nclaim for intentional interference with contract contained\nin Count III was linked inextricably with the allegations\nthat Dr. Prabhakar’s actions were motived by sex, race\nand national origin. Therefore, the Illinois Human Rights\nAct provided the exclusive remedy for the alleged con-\nduct and preempted Dr. Nanda’s state tort claim. The\ncourt therefore granted Dr. Prabhakar’s motion to dis-\nmiss Count III.\n  The University timely appealed the district court’s denial\n                                          1\nof its motion to dismiss Counts I and II.\n\n\n\n1\n  Dr. Nanda did not cross-appeal the district court’s dismissal\nof Count III, and no arguments concerning Count III are before\nthis court.\n\f6                                                  No. 01-3448\n\n                               II\n                        DISCUSSION\nA. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, this court has jurisdiction only\nfrom “final decisions” of the district courts. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291; Cherry v. Univ. of Wis. Sys. Bd. of Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774913\"><a href=\"/opinion/774913/kelly-cherry-v-university-of-wisconsin-system-board-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546 (7th Cir. 2001). This court has held that a district\ncourt’s denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final decision.\nSee United States v. Michelle’s Lounge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681629\"><a href=\"/opinion/681629/united-states-v-michelles-lounge-14199-s-cicero-crestwood-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (7th\nCir. 1994) (“Ordinarily, of course, a denial of a motion\nto dismiss is not a final order.”). However, the collateral\norder doctrine provides a “narrow” exception to the final-\nity rule. This doctrine permits an appeal from a non-final\njudgment, such as the denial of a motion to dismiss, when\nthe following criteria are met: (1) the order “conclusively\ndetermine[s] a disputed question”; (2) the order “resolve[s]\nan important issue completely separate from the merits\nof the action”; and (3) the order is “effectively unreview-\nable on appeal from a final judgment.” Coopers & Lybrand\nv.

It is well-settled that the\nissue of Eleventh Amendment immunity, which encom-\npasses both immunity from liability as well as immu-\nnity from suit, is “irretrievably lost” if not immediately ap-\npealable and therefore is properly raised in a collateral\nappeal. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf\n& Eddy, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf-eddy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 147 (1993) (“We hold that\nStates and state entities that claim to be ‘arms of the State’\nmay take advantage of the collateral order doctrine to ap-\npeal a district court order denying a claim of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.”). Thus, we have jurisdiction to\nreview the district court’s denial of Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity.\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                 7\n\n   We review a district court’s decision to dismiss a claim\non Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds de novo.\nSee Cherry, 265 F.3d at 547. The University urges us to re-\nverse the district court’s decision on the Eleventh Amend-\nment issue and reiterates many of the arguments that\nit made in support of its motion to dismiss. Specifically,\nthe University contends that, when the Supreme Court\nhanded down its most recent Eleventh Amendment case,\nBoard of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), the Court established a higher bar for\ncongressional abrogation of the States’ Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity. In the University’s view, in order to abro-\ngate properly Eleventh Amendment immunity, a Con-\ngressional enactment must not only pass the “congruence\nand proportionality” test, but also must be supported\nby clear evidence of past constitutional violations set forth\nin the legislative record. The district court, continues\nthe University, paid only lip service to this second re-\nquirement. The University contends that, because the\nlegislative record does not reveal a pattern of past con-\nstitutional wrongs to support the extension of Title VII to\nthe States, Title VII cannot survive an Eleventh Amendment\nchallenge.\n   Dr. Nanda, and the United States as intervenor, argue the\nopposite. According to these parties, federal courts only\nhave to look for a legislative record of constitutional\nviolations if the congressional action fails the “congruence\nand proportionality” test. In their view, because Title\nVII proscribes only unconstitutional behavior, the dis-\ntrict court did not have to examine the legislative record\nfor a history of constitutional violations. In the alterna-\ntive, Dr. Nanda and the United States maintain that, if\ncourts have to examine the legislative record to assess\nthe need for congressional action, there is ample evidence\n\f8                                                     No. 01-3448\n\nin the record to justify the extension of Title VII to the\n        2\nStates.\n  The Eleventh Amendment states: “The Judicial power of\nthe United States shall not be construed to extend to any\nsuit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against\none of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by\nCitizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” U.S. Const.\n\n\n\n2\n   The United States argues that Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109520\"><a href=\"/opinion/109520/fitzpatrick-v-bitzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1976), disposes of the issue currently before this court. In\nFitzpatrick, the Court determined that Congress, as part of its\npowers under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, may “provide\nfor private suits against States or state officials which are\nconstitutionally impermissible in other contexts.” Id. at 456.\nAlthough many courts, including our own, see Merhab v.

The combination\nof this possibility with the detailed Eleventh Amendment anal-\nysis the Court has employed in recent cases suggests to us\nthat the most prudent course is to assume that neither Fitz-\npatrick nor our earlier summary treatment of the issue through\nreliance on Fitzpatrick necessarily disposes of the issue currently\nbefore us.\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                        9\n            3\namend.

Congress, therefore, “may sub-\nject nonconsenting States to suit in federal court when it\ndoes so pursuant to a valid exercise of its § 5 power.”\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 364.

Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107256\"><a href=\"/opinion/107256/katzenbach-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651 (1966)). “Legislation which deters or remedies\nconstitutional violations can fall within the sweep of Con-\ngress’ enforcement power even if in the process it prohib-\nits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and in-\ntrudes into ‘legislative spheres of autonomy previously\nreserved to the states.’ ” Id. at 518. However broad Con-\ngress’ power under § 5, the Court continued, it is not\nunlimited. The Court explained that “[t]he design of the\nAmendment and the text of § 5 are inconsistent with the\nsuggestion that Congress has the power to decree the\nsubstance of the Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on\nthe States.” Id. at 519. Congress is limited to “enforcing” the\nrights guaranteed by the Amendment. Id. The Court recog-\nnized that\n    [w]hile the line between measures that remedy or\n    prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that\n    make a substantive change in the governing law is\n    not easy to discern, and Congress must have wide\n    latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction\n    exists and must be observed. There must be a congru-\n    ence and proportionality between the injury to be\n    prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that\n    end.\nId. at 519-20.\n  The Court then examined the provisions of RFRA to\ndetermine if it was a valid exercise of Congress’ § 5 powers.\n\f12                                               No. 01-3448\n\nThe parties presented RFRA as a measure to “prevent[]\nand remed[y] laws which are enacted with the unconsti-\ntutional object of targeting religious beliefs and practices.”\nId. at 529. The Court stated that “[t]he appropriateness\nof remedial measures must be considered in light of the\nevil presented. Strong measures appropriate to address\none harm may be an unwarranted response to another,\nlesser one.” Id. at 530 (citing South Carolina v. Katzenbach,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107182\"><a href=\"/opinion/107182/south-carolina-v-katzenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (1966)). According to the Court, RFRA’s\nlegislative record lacked examples of instances in which\nlaws of general applicability were enacted by the States\nfor the purpose of inflicting religious discrimination.\nRather, congressional hearings had focused on laws of\ngeneral applicability that placed only incidental burdens\non religion. The lack of a legislative record, however,\nwas not dispositive. The Court stated that\n     [r]egardless of the state of the legislative record, RFRA\n     cannot be considered remedial, preventive legisla-\n     tion, if those terms are to have any meaning. RFRA is\n     so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preven-\n     tive object that it cannot be understood as responsive\n     to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\nId. at 532. Consequently, RFRA could not stand in the face\nof the Eleventh Amendment challenge.\n\n\n     b. Florida Prepaid\n  The Court next addressed the interplay of the Eleventh\nand Fourteenth Amendments in Florida Prepaid Post Second-\nary Education Examination Board v.

In that case, the Court addressed an\nEleventh Amendment challenge to the Patent and Plant\nVariety Protection Remedy Clarification Act (the “Patent\nRemedy Act”), which allowed patent holders to pursue\n\fNo. 01-3448                                               13\n\ninfringement actions against the States. In assessing the\nvalidity of the congressional action, the Court reiterated\nthe requirements of congruence and proportionality estab-\nlished in City of Boerne:\n    We . . . held that for Congress to invoke § 5, it must\n    identify conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amend-\n    ment’s substantive provisions, and must tailor its\n    legislative scheme to remedying or preventing such\n    conduct.\n      RFRA failed to meet this test because there was little\n    support in the record for the concerns that animated\n    the law.\nId. at 639.\n  Following this course, the Court first identified the\nFourteenth Amendment “evil” or “wrong” that Congress\nintended to remedy “ ‘with reference to the historical ex-\nperience . . . it reflects.’ ” Id. at 639-40 (quoting City of\nBoerne, 521 U.S. at 525). In Florida Prepaid, as in City of\nBoerne, the Court was unable to identify a pattern of con-\nstitutional wrongs by the States against patent holders. The\nCourt went on to state that, although the “lack of support\nin the legislative record is not determinative,” id. at 646,\nidentifying and assessing “the wrong or evil is still a crit-\nical part of our § 5 calculus because ‘[s]trong measures\nappropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted\nresponse to another, lesser one,’ ” id. (quoting City of\nBoerne, 521 U.S. at 530). When there is little evidence of\nconstitutional harm in the legislative record, the means of\ncombatting the feared unconstitutional action must be\ntailored to address clear constitutional violations. Because\nthe Patent Remedy Act offended this principle of propor-\ntionality, the Court held that it was not a valid exercise\nof Congress’ § 5 powers.\n\f14                                               No. 01-3448\n\n     c. Kimel\n   The Age Discrimination in Employment Act was the\nnext Congressional enactment to meet with an Eleventh\nAmendment challenge. In Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118323\"><a href=\"/opinion/118323/kimel-v-florida-bd-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), the Court addressed the issue of wheth-\ner Congress validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment im-\nmunity in the ADEA. The Court reiterated the breadth of\ncongressional power pursuant to the Fourteenth Amend-\nment: “Congress’ power ‘to enforce’ the Amendment in-\ncludes the authority both to remedy and to deter viola-\ntion of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a\nsomewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which\nis not itself forbidden by the Amendment’s text.” Id. at 81.\nHowever, applying its now-established congruence and\nproportionality requirements, see id. at 82, the Court held\nthat “the ADEA is not ‘appropriate legislation’ under § 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id. at 82-83. Initially, the\nCourt observed that, because age discrimination is sub-\nject only to rational basis review under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause, only irrational age classifications violate the\nConstitution. “Judged against the backdrop of our equal\nprotection jurisprudence [on age discrimination],” the Court\nstated, “it is clear that the ADEA is ‘so out of proportion\nto a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot\nbe understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent un-\nconstitutional behavior.’ ” Id. at 86 (quoting City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 532). However, “[t]hat the ADEA prohibits\nvery little conduct likely to be held unconstitutional, while\nsignificant, d[id] not alone provide the answer to [the] § 5\ninquiry.” Id. at 88. The Court’s task was to discern whether\nthe ADEA was proper prophylactic legislation or an at-\ntempt by Congress “to substantively redefine the States’\nlegal obligations with respect to age discrimination,” and\none means to make such a determination was to examine\nthe legislative record. Id. To the Court, this review con-\n\fNo. 01-3448                                               15\n\nfirmed that Congress’ extension of the ADEA to the\nStates “was an unwarranted response to a perhaps inconse-\nquential problem.” Id. at 89. According to the Court,\n    Congress never identified any pattern of age discrim-\n    ination by the States, much less any discrimination\n    whatsoever that rose to the level of constitutional\n    violation. The evidence compiled by petitioners to\n    demonstrate such attention by Congress to age dis-\n    crimination by the States falls well short of the mark.\n    That evidence consists almost entirely of isolated sen-\n    tences clipped from floor debates and legislative re-\n    ports.\nId. Looking back to its decision in City of Boerne, the Court\nheld that, although this lack of support in the legisla-\ntive record was not determinative, “Congress’ failure to\nuncover any significant pattern of unconstitutional discrimi-\nnation here confirms that Congress had no reason to be-\nlieve that broad prophylactic legislation was necessary in\nthis field.” Id. at 91. The Court then concluded that, “[i]n\nlight of the indiscriminate scope of the Act’s substan-\ntive requirements, and the lack of evidence of widespread\nand unconstitutional age discrimination by the States, we\nhold that the ADEA is not a valid exercise of Congress’\npower under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id.\n\n\n    d. Garrett\n   Finally, in Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama\nv. Garrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118407\"><a href=\"/opinion/118407/board-of-trustees-of-univ-of-ala-v-garrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), the Court considered an\nEleventh Amendment challenge to the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”). Again, the Court’s task was to\ndetermine whether the ADA was proper enforcement leg-\nislation, as opposed to a usurpation of the Court’s respon-\nsibility “to define the substance of constitutional guaran-\n\f16                                              No. 01-3448\n\ntees.” Id. at 365. “Accordingly,” stated the Court, “§ 5\nlegislation reaching beyond the scope of § 1’s actual guaran-\ntees must exhibit ‘congruence and proportionality between\nthe injury to be prevented or remedied and the means\nadopted to that end.’ ” Id. (quoting City of Boerne, 521 U.S.\nat 520). The Court’s first step in this analysis was to iden-\ntify the scope of the constitutional right at issue. It noted\nthat the Equal Protection clause affords only rational\nbasis review for disability discrimination. Once the Court\ndetermined “the metes and bounds of the constitutional\nright in question, [it] examine[d] whether Congress identi-\nfied a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment\ndiscrimination by the States against the disabled.” Id. at\n368. It noted that “Congress’ § 5 authority is appropriately\nexercised only in response to state transgressions.” Id.\nHowever, the legislative record of the ADA, the Court\nnoted, focused heavily on the private sector. Few ex-\namples from the record involved the States, and the Court\nfound it “debatable” whether these incidents evidenced\n“irrational” state action or merely “an unwillingness on\nthe part of state officials to make the sort of accommoda-\ntions for the disabled required by the ADA.” Id. at 370.\nHowever, the Court held that, even if each incident\nshowed unconstitutional action on the part of the State,\n“these incidents taken together fall far short of even sug-\ngesting the pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on\nwhich § 5 legislation must be based,” id., and thus the\nADA “raise[d] the same sort of concerns as to congruence\nand proportionality as were found in City of Boerne,” id. at\n372. “[I]n order to authorize private individuals to recover\nmoney damages against the States,” the Court stated, “there\nmust be a pattern of discrimination by the States which\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment, and the remedy im-\nposed by Congress must be congruent and proportional\nto the targeted violation.” Id. at 374. With respect to the\nADA, those requirements had not been met. See id.\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                 17\n\n   Although articulated and ordered slightly differently\nwithin each case, we believe that these cases identify sev-\neral guiding principles that must inform our Eleventh\nAmendment analysis. First, congressional action taken\npursuant to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment is not lim-\nited to parroting the language of § 1. Section 5 is a positive\ngrant of power, and Congress may enact reasonable pro-\nphylactic legislation in the face of constitutional violations.\n  However, Congress’ enforcement power must stop\nshort of redefining the States’ substantive obligations\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether a particular\ncongressional response enforces, as opposed to defines,\nthe States’ obligations under § 1 of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment is determined by looking at the scope of the enact-\nment compared with the constitutional right being pro-\ntected. If the scope of the remedy is broad, it must be\njustified by a proportionately pressing need. Finally, al-\nthough legislative history is not determinative of this\ninquiry, it is one means—and perhaps the most telling\nmeans—of assessing the depth of the constitutional prob-\nlem and the consequent need for a congressional remedy.\n\n\n  2. Circuit Precedent\n   This court has applied the principles set forth above in\nconsidering two Eleventh Amendment challenges to the\nEqual Pay Act. In Varner v. Illinois State University, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770441\"><a href=\"/opinion/770441/dr-iris-i-varner-and-united-states-of-america-intervening-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001),\nthis court followed the analysis set forth by the Supreme\nCourt in City of Boerne and its progeny, and first looked\nat the conduct targeted by the Equal Pay Act. We acknowl-\nedged that, in light of the burden-shifting provisions of the\nEqual Pay Act, “an employer is potentially subject to\nliability without a showing of discriminatory intent”—a\n\f18                                              No. 01-3448\n\nprerequisite for a constitutional violation. Id. at 932. How-\never, we noted, based on the Court’s rulings, the fact\nthat the Equal Pay Act prohibited some constitutional\nconduct did not end the inquiry: “The question before us,\ntherefore, is not whether the remedial provisions of the\nEqual Pay Act prohibit some constitutional conduct.\nInstead, we must consider whether the Act can be char-\nacterized as a proportional and congruent response to\nthe problem of unconstitutional wage discrimination\nbased on gender.” Id. at 933.\n  In applying the principles of congruence and propor-\ntionality, we noted three distinctions between the Equal Pay\nAct and the legislative provisions that the Court had\nstruck down. First, the Equal Pay Act was “less indis-\ncriminate in scope” than those acts, id.; it contained ex-\nemptions from liability for employers “who can provide\na neutral explanation for a disparity in pay,” id. at 934.\nFurthermore, the Equal Pay Act addressed a problem—\ngender discrimination—which was subject to heightened\nscrutiny under the Constitution. Finally, Congress had\ngained an historical understanding of the problem of gen-\nder discrimination through other legislation. All of these\nconsiderations militated against a finding that Congress\nhad acted to redefine the States’ obligations under the\nEqual Protection Clause as opposed to simply enforcing\nthe already stringent requirements on the States.\n  In upholding the Equal Pay Act against the Eleventh\nAmendment challenge, we rejected the view that explicit\nlegislative findings were a necessary element of the § 5\ninquiry. In Varner, the University had urged that, because\n“the legislative findings underlying the Equal Pay Act\naddress only the problem of discrimination in private\nindustry,” there was no record to justify extension of\nthe Equal Pay Act to public employers. Id. at 935. We stated:\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                  19\n\n    Although we recognize that a review of the legislative\n    record can be an instructive means of distinguish-\n    ing appropriate remedial action from an impermis-\n    sible substantive change in legal rights, we want to\n    emphasize that a “lack of support [in the legislative\n    record] is not determinative of the § 5 inquiry.” This\n    observation is particularly relevant in the context of\n    the Equal Pay Act, where the value of congressional\n    findings is greatly diminished by the fact that the Act\n    prohibits very little constitutional conduct and where\n    the historical record clearly demonstrates that gender\n    discrimination is a problem that is national in scope.\nId. (quoting Kimel, 528 U.S. at 91; internal citations omitted).\nConsequently, we determined that subjecting state enti-\nties to liability under the Equal Pay Act did not violate the\nEleventh Amendment.\n  Shortly thereafter, we revisited our decision in Varner\nin light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Garrett. See\nCherry v. Univ. of Wis. Sys. Bd. of Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774913\"><a href=\"/opinion/774913/kelly-cherry-v-university-of-wisconsin-system-board-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th\nCir. 2001). We restated the governing standard as follows:\n    Congress can enact legislation to remedy or prevent\n    conduct that violates the Fourteenth Amendment, but\n    Congress cannot redefine or expand the substance of\n    the Fourteenth Amendment itself. Thus there must be\n    a congruence and proportionality between the injury to\n    be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to\n    that end. This means that Congress must carefully\n    tailor its legislation so that it enforces the Fourteenth\n    Amendment without altering the Amendment’s mean-\n    ing.\nId. at 549 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nWe then examined the scope of the Equal Pay Act to\ndetermine whether it was consistent and compatible with\n\f20                                                 No. 01-3448\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment or whether it expanded the\nsubstantive prohibitions of the Amendment by prohibit-\ning more state action than would be unconstitutional.\nAs part of this analysis, we examined the legislative rec-\nord to assess whether Congress had identified a pattern of\nunconstitutional conduct by the States. Noting that the\nCourt had advised that this evidence “is not determinative\nof the § 5 inquiry,” we stated that “[s]uch evidence tends to\nensure that Congress’ means are appropriate under § 5\nwhen the statute in question pervasively prohibits consti-\ntutional State action.” Id. at 549 (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted). We dismissed the argument that\nGarrett\n     established a new, bright-line rule that Congress’\n     attempt to abrogate immunity from a federal statute\n     is invalid if the statute lacks specific findings that\n     the States had engaged in a pattern of unconstitu-\n     tional conduct of the type prohibited by the statute. . . .\n     All Garrett does is further demonstrate that the legisla-\n     tive record is an important factor when the statute in\n     question pervasively prohibits constitutional State\n     action.\nId. at 553. Consequently, again we sustained the Equal Pay\nAct as it applied to the States.\n\n\n  3. Application\n  As detailed above, in determining whether Congress\noverstepped its constitutional authority in applying Title VII\nto the States, we must “identify with some precision the\nscope of the constitutional right at issue,” here the limita-\ntions that § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment places upon\nStates’ treatment of women and of ethnic and racial minori-\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                      21\n\nties. Garrett, 531 U.S. at 365. We explained this level of\nprotection in Varner:\n    Under the Constitution, gender-based classifications\n    are afforded heightened scrutiny. Once an individual is\n    able to establish the existence of a gender-based dis-\n    tinction, “[p]arties who seek to defend gender-based\n    government action must demonstrate an ‘exceedingly\n    persuasive justification’ for that action.”\n226 F.3d at 934 (quoting United States v.

At issue here is the disparate treat-\nment prohibition of Title VII.

Thus, both the\naim of Title VII, as well as the method for proving viola-\ntions of Title VII, are the same as those of the Equal Protec-\n             7\ntion Clause.\n\n\n7\n   Both Dr. Nanda and the Government argue that Title VII does\nnot prohibit any constitutional conduct because the burdens of\nproof on employers is the same under both the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause and Title VII. The University responds to this argu-\nment accordingly:\n    The substantive provisions of Title VII were enacted in 1964,\n    not in 1972, and the States at that time were expressly\n    excluded from coverage because of sovereign immunity. If\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f24                                                    No. 01-3448\n\n  A review of the standards of the Equal Protection Clause\nand of Title VII reveals that Title VII “enforces the Four-\nteenth Amendment without altering its meaning.” Cherry,\n265 F.3d at 549. The fact that Congress was not attempt-\ning to “redefine” the Fourteenth Amendment in extend-\ning Title VII to the States is also clear from the legislative\nrecord. In undertaking a review of the legislative record,\nwe are cognizant of the Court’s instruction that “lack of\nsupport [in the legislative record] is not determinative of\nthe § 5 inquiry,” Kimel, 528 U.S. at 91, and we recognize\nthat “the value of congressional findings is greatly dimin-\nished” by the fact that the disparate treatment provisions\nof Title VII prohibit little, if any, constitutional conduct,\nVarner, 226 F.3d at 935.\n\n\n\n7\n    (...continued)\n       the court were to accept the argument of Nanda and the\n       United States, the court would be required to conclude\n       that since, in 1964, the Title VII protections were identical\n       to the protections of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment\n       they were at that time, by definition, congruent and propor-\n       tional and that, abrogation, without more, occurred. The\n       court would then have to conclude that in 1964, Congress,\n       when it enacted Title VII, abrogated the States’ immunity\n       and at the same time expressly excluded the States from Title\n       VII’s coverage, an absurd conclusion.\nReply Br. at 1-2. This response, we believe, lacks both logic and\npersuasiveness. The substantive provisions of Title VII did not\nchange between 1964 and 1972; the 1972 amendment mere-\nly extended Title VII to the States. It is perfectly appropriate,\ntherefore, in applying principles of congruence and proportional-\nity, to compare the substantive provisions of Title VII, as ex-\ntended to the States in 1972, to the limitations placed on the\nStates by the Equal Protection Clause.\n\fNo. 01-3448                                                25\n\n   In the present case, the legislative record confirms that\nCongress was responding to a pattern of discrimination\nby the States. The legislative history shows that Congress\nrelied upon and adopted two comprehensive studies of\nracial and national origin discrimination to support its\nproposed legislation. See H.R. Rep. No. 92-238, at 17 (1971).\nThe first of these “indicate[d] that widespread discrim-\nination against minorities exist[ed] in State and local\ngovernment employment . . . .” Id. The legislative record\nalso specifically addresses the problem of racial and gen-\nder discrimination in academia. See id. at 19-20. Finally,\nstatistical evidence bolstered Congress’ view that “there\nexist[ed] a profound economic discrimination against\nwomen workers” across all fields, and, consequently, leg-\nislation was needed to strengthen and broaden federal\nadministrative procedures for combatting this discrimina-\ntion. Id. at 4.\n  Not only did Congress document the need for additional\nlegislation protecting minority and women workers em-\nployed by the states, local governments, and specifically\neducational institutions, Congress had become familiar with\nthe problems of race and national origin discrimination\nin the public and private sector in enacting the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and with the problems of gender\ndiscrimination in considering the Equal Rights Amendment\nand the Educational Opportunity Act, see Okruhlik v.\nUniv. of Ark. ex rel. May, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773856\"><a href=\"/opinion/773856/gwenn-okruhlik-united-states-intervenor-on-appeal-v-the-university-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625 (8th Cir. 2001).\nSuch familiarity “ ‘reduce[s] the need for fresh hearings\nand prolonged debates.’ ” Id. (quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110338\"><a href=\"/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring)). As we\nconcluded in Varner, “[w]e believe that this evidence is\nsufficient to support the limited action taken by Congress\nin its passage of [the 1972 Act], particularly given the well-\ndocumented history of gender [and race] discrimina-\ntion in this Nation, a history that is embodied in the Su-\n\f26                                                   No. 01-3448\n\npreme Court’s own jurisprudence.” Varner, 226 F.3d at\n935-36.\n  We are not alone in concluding that Congress validly\nabrogated the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity in\npassing the 1972 Act. In Okruhlik, the Eighth Circuit also\nrejected an Eleventh Amendment challenge to Title VII.\nFollowing the guidelines of the Supreme Court, that cir-\ncuit looked at the legislative history where it found “much\nsupport” for Congress’ action. Okruhlik, 255 F.3d at 624.\nAs well, it compared the scope of the employer’s responsi-\nbility under Title VII to its responsibility under the Equal\nProtection Clause and noted that “the elements of a claim\nof intentional discrimination are essentially the same un-\nder Title VII and the Constitution.” Id. at 626. Any dif-\nferences between the two protections, either by way of\n                     8\nremedies or scope, were “proportional and congruent”\nresponses to a pattern of unconstitutional state action. Id.\n  Because the disparate treatment provision of Title VII\nprohibits little if any constitutional behavior and because\nCongress was acting on a solid evidentiary ground in ex-\ntending Title VII to the States, we hold that the 1972 Act\nvalidly abrogated the States’ Eleventh Amendment im-\nmunity with respect to Title VII disparate treatment claims.\n\n\nB. Prayer for Injunctive Relief in Count II\n  The University also challenges the district court’s failure\nto dismiss Dr. Nanda’s claims for injunctive relief pursuant\n\n\n8\n  The Eighth Circuit considered the effect of Title VII’s disparate\nimpact provisions as well as Title VII’s disparate treatment\nprovision.

The University and its officials con-\ntend that the district court erred when it let stand Dr.\nNanda’s request in Count II for injunctive relief against\nthe University officials in their official capacities. Because\nthe requested relief of reinstatement can be granted only\nby the University acting through its trustees, the defen-\ndants contend that this request is appropriately character-\nized as a request for injunctive relief against the Univer-\nsity. The University, they continue, is protected by the\nEleventh Amendment from such relief. Before we address\nthe merits of this claim, we must first consider whether we\n                                                          9\nhave jurisdiction to entertain this aspect of the appeal.\n  We believe that we have jurisdiction over this conten-\ntion for the same reason that we have jurisdiction over\nthe earlier contention concerning the applicability of the\nEleventh Amendment to a suit under Title VII. In essence,\nthe defendants are claiming that the Eleventh Amend-\nment provides them with a shield from litigating this\nclaim. This situation therefore is different from the situa-\ntion in Cherry in which we held that a claim of immu-\nnity from punitive damages under Title IX was not the\nequivalent of a claim of immunity from litigation.
