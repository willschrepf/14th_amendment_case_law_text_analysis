F11-33962-R\n                 IN THE 265TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT\n                            DALLAS COUNTY\n\n       H ERVEY, J., delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court.\n\n                                      OPINION\n\n       In August 2012, a jury convicted Tyrone Cade, Appellant, of capital murder for\n\nstabbing his girlfriend and her teenaged daughter to death during the same criminal\n\ntransaction or pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct. T EX. P ENAL C ODE\n\n§ 19.03(a)(7). Pursuant to the jury’s answers to the special issues set forth in Texas Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure Article 37.071, sections 2(b) and 2(e)(1), the trial judge sentenced\n\f                                                                                             Cade–2\n\nAppellant to death. T EX. C ODE C RIM. P ROC. A RT. 37.071, § 2(g).1 Direct appeal to this\n\nCourt is automatic. Art. 37.071, § 2(h). Appellant raises forty-four points of error. After\n\nreviewing Appellant’s claims, we find them to be without merit. Consequently, we affirm\n\nthe trial court’s judgment and sentence.\n\n                                  I. F ACTS OF THE OFFENSE\n\n       The jury heard evidence that Appellant and Mischell Fuller had been romantically\n\ninvolved for a number of years. They had also lived together in Fuller’s house for several\n\nyears. Appellant’s eleven year-old daughter, Tyra Cade, and Fuller’s seventeen-year-old\n\ndaughter, Desaree Hoskins, lived with them. Desaree was Fuller’s daughter with her ex-\n\nhusband, Karlton Hoskins, who was in prison when Fuller and Appellant began dating.\n\nMichael Hoskins, Fuller’s older child with Karlton, lived in Denton.\n\n       Although Appellant was still living in Fuller’s house at the time of the killings,\n\ntheir relationship had deteriorated due to various factors. One factor was Karlton’s 2009\n\nrelease from a Florida prison, after which he began to reestablish a relationship with\n\nMichael and Desaree. Fuller greatly encouraged Karlton’s efforts. Although Karlton lived\n\nin Florida, he became a presence in Fuller’s and the children’s lives. Appellant, who was\n\njealous and possessive of Fuller, disliked her contact with Karlton. He suspected Fuller of\n\nrekindling a romantic relationship with Karlton and told her that he did not want her ex-\n\nhusband to call the house. Even before Karlton’s renewed presence, Fuller had repeatedly\n\n       1\n       Unless otherwise stated, all future references to Articles are to the Texas Code of\nCriminal Procedure.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–3\n\nasked Appellant to move out. Appellant refused, and after one such request made shortly\n\nbefore the killings, threatened to burn the house down with Fuller in it. Although Fuller\n\nand Appellant still slept in the same bed, they had not been sexually intimate in several\n\nmonths.\n\n       The killings occurred sometime in the early hours of March 27, 2011. Later that\n\nday, Appellant turned himself in by calling 9-1-1 from a pay phone in a police station\n\nlobby. After receiving Miranda2 warnings, Appellant gave officers video-recorded\n\nstatements in which he confessed to the killings in detail. According to his statements, on\n\nthe evening of March 26, 2011, he hid a recording device near Fuller’s side of the bed,\n\nthen went to a strip club with his cousin. After a few hours in the club, followed by an\n\nunsuccessful search for prostitutes, Appellant returned to Fuller’s house around 2:00 a.m.\n\nThe recording device had captured a Skype conversation between Fuller and Karlton, and\n\nAppellant listened to it when he returned home. Roughly two hours into the recording,\n\nAppellant heard the conversation become sexual in nature.\n\n       Soon thereafter, Appellant got into bed with Fuller, who fell asleep but was later\n\nawakened by Appellant’s tossing and turning in bed. When Fuller told Appellant to lie down\n\nand go to sleep, Appellant showed Fuller a kitchen knife. Fuller began screaming when she\n\nsaw the knife, and Appellant repeatedly stabbed her. Fuller’s screams woke Desaree, who\n\nran into the bedroom to help her mother. Appellant stabbed Desaree several times and then\n\n\n\n       2\n           Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\f                                                                                          Cade–4\n\nreturned to Fuller. When Desaree started to get up, Appellant stabbed her again multiple\n\ntimes as she screamed and attempted to crawl away from him. When Desaree stopped\n\nscreaming and moving, Appellant walked back to Fuller, who was still alive and conscious.\n\nAppellant vaginally and anally raped Fuller, claiming that he ejaculated “[i]n her, on her,\n\neverywhere” because she made him feel like a sex offender.3 Appellant believed Fuller lived\n\nfor thirty to forty minutes after he first stabbed her, and he asserted that he sexually assaulted\n\nher for twenty to thirty minutes of that time. While he was sexually assaulting Fuller,\n\nAppellant heard Desaree speaking. He believed that Desaree survived longer than Fuller.\n\n       Officers found Fuller’s body in the master bedroom, face down and naked below\n\nthe waist. Fuller’s buttocks and vaginal area were propped up on several pillows; a bottle\n\nof lubricant lay next to her body. Desaree’s body was in the hallway, immediately outside\n\nthe bedroom. In a bathroom, officers found a bloody knife and notebook containing\n\nAppellant’s handwritten notes. Appellant wrote that Fuller had “kicked [him] to the curb”\n\nwhen she began trying to mend the relationship between Karlton and her children.\n\nAppellant also wrote that, because he could not live without Fuller, he took Fuller from\n\nhimself and “from . . . anyone else.” Although he expressed remorse for the killings,\n\n\n       3\n         When Fuller and Appellant began dating, he was facing charges in Collin County for the\n1999 aggravated sexual assault of Charity Trice. As we discuss in greater detail regarding point\nof error fifteen, a jury subsequently convicted Appellant of that offense. The convicting court\nsentenced him to a three-year term of community supervision that included a ninety-day jail term\nas a condition of community supervision. The community-supervision conditions also required\nAppellant to register as a sex offender and attend a sex-offender treatment program. After\nAppellant was terminated from his sex-offender treatment program, the convicting court revoked\nhis community supervision and sentenced him to three years in prison.\n\f                                                                                        Cade–5\n\nAppellant also frequently deflected responsibility away from himself, writing, for\n\nexample, “[Fuller] used to treat me so good. Not like a sex offender”; “I’m truly sorry,\n\nshe drove me crazy trying to fix things with her kids and the father”; “I feel bad for so\n\nmany people, especially who knew . . . [Fuller]. All I can say is she had a bad side . . . . It\n\nwasn’t always sunshine”; and “Thank Karlton Hoskins for this one.”\n\n       The medical examiner, Jill Urban, M.D., testified that Fuller died from being\n\nstabbed twenty-eight times. Urban found defensive wounds on Fuller’s hands and wrists.\n\nSeveral wounds to Fuller’s face, neck, and chest area were between four and five inches\n\ndeep. Desaree’s death resulted from thirty-nine stab wounds, many of which were also\n\nbetween four and five inches deep. Urban testified that the perpetrator used a great deal of\n\nforce in inflicting Desaree’s injuries, noting that the wounds penetrated her bones.\n\n                                    II. I NSANITY DEFENSE\n\n       In point of error seven, Appellant contends that the evidence of his insanity so\n\ngreatly outweighed the State’s contrary evidence when viewed in a neutral light that the\n\nverdict is manifestly unjust. We disagree.\n\n       Texas law excuses a defendant from criminal responsibility if he proves, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, the affirmative defense of insanity. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE\n\n§ 8.01(a). The relevant inquiry is whether, at the time of the charged conduct, and as the\n\nresult of a severe mental disease or defect, the defendant did not know that his conduct\n\nwas wrong. See id.; see also Ruffin v. State, 270 S.W.3d 586, 592 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)\n\f                                                                                        Cade–6\n\n(noting that “wrong” in the Section 8.01 context means “illegal”). In reviewing a rejected\n\naffirmative defense such as insanity, we consider all of the evidence relevant to that\n\ndefense in a neutral light. Matlock v. State, 392 S.W.3d 662, 671 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\nAlthough the Court views the relevant evidence in a neutral light, we may not usurp the\n\njury’s function by substituting our judgment for the jury’s assessment of witness\n\ncredibility and the weight of the evidence. Id.\n\n       To support his insanity defense, Appellant offered lay testimony from his half-\n\nbrother, Gregory Scott. Scott asserted that Appellant suffered from a severe mental defect\n\nand did not know his conduct was wrong when he killed Fuller and Desaree. Scott\n\ntestified that he was four years older than Appellant and lived with Appellant, their\n\nmother, and Appellant’s biological father, Jerry Cade Ford, until the age of six or seven.\n\nScott, who asserted that he and Appellant came from a “crazy bloodline,” testified that\n\nFord had mental problems. After the age of six or seven, Scott lived with his\n\ngrandparents. He had minimal contact with Appellant until they were both adults and\n\ntheir now-deceased mother became terminally ill. Scott testified that he and Appellant had\n\ndifficult childhoods because their mother and Ford frequently abused each other in front\n\nof them. According to Scott, Appellant seemed different and emotionally unstable after\n\nserving a prison sentence for aggravated sexual assault. Scott also asserted that\n\nAppellant’s mental state at the time of the offense was unstable, primarily due to chronic\n\nback pain that Appellant self-treated with pain patches. Scott admitted that he had\n\f                                                                                     Cade–7\n\ndisliked Fuller and that he had suggested that Appellant place the recording device near\n\nher bed.\n\n       Appellant also presented testimony from three psychologists: Daniel Altman,\n\nMichael Gottlieb, and Gilda Kessner. Dr. Altman testified that he reviewed Ford’s\n\nmental-health records, which showed that Ford had been diagnosed with schizophrenia\n\nand schizoaffective disorder. Altman told the jury that, based on heritability research and\n\nFord’s diagnoses, Appellant had a 9–18% risk of developing the characteristics of\n\nschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. On cross-examination, Altman acknowledged\n\nthat he did not examine or purport to diagnose Appellant with schizophrenia or any other\n\nmental illness. He also stated that, in males, schizophrenia usually appears by a person’s\n\nmid-twenties, and that it would be very unlikely for a thirty-eight-year-old male\n\n(Appellant’s age at the time of the offense) to spontaneously develop schizophrenia.\n\nMoreover, according to Altman, the vast majority of people with mental illnesses,\n\nincluding schizophrenics, understand the difference between right and wrong.\n\n       Dr. Gottlieb testified that he learned through defense counsel of allegations that\n\nAppellant’s mother and cousins sexually abused Appellant as a child. Gottlieb told the\n\njury that some sexually abused children may develop psychological symptoms during\n\nadulthood. These symptoms can include internalizing and externalizing behavior,\n\nphysiological symptoms, distorted perceptions as a result of their experiences, and other\n\nissues. However, the symptoms are nonspecific, meaning that they could originate from\n\f                                                                                          Cade–8\n\nsomething entirely unrelated to the earlier abuse, and there is no causal link between the\n\nearlier abuse and a particular psychological difficulty, if any, that subsequently develops.\n\nOn cross-examination, Gottlieb acknowledged that he received no independent\n\ncorroboration that the alleged sexual abuse actually occurred. And because he did not\n\nexamine Appellant or review any of his records, Gottlieb also could not say whether\n\nAppellant actually manifested any psychological symptoms that might be consistent with\n\nchildhood sexual abuse. Gottlieb further agreed that individuals who have been abused as\n\nchildren and develop psychological symptoms as adults are usually still able to conform\n\ntheir behavior to societal norms. Gottlieb offered no opinion concerning whether\n\nAppellant was insane at the time of the offense.\n\n        Defense counsel deposed Appellant’s father, Ford, in anticipation of Appellant’s\n\ncapital-murder trial. Following Gottlieb’s testimony, and in the jury’s presence, counsel\n\nread a portion of Ford’s deposition testimony into the record.4 In that excerpt, Ford\n\nasserted that he discovered Appellant’s mother performing fellatio on Appellant when\n\nAppellant was about two years old. Ford testified that he responded by hitting Appellant’s\n\nmother in the head with a hammer and stated that Appellant witnessed him inflict the\n\nblow.\n\n        Dr. Kessner acknowledged that she worked exclusively for the defense in capital\n\n\n\n        4\n         Over Appellant’s objection, the trial judge excluded portions of Ford’s videotaped\ndeposition. Appellant proffered the entire deposition for purposes of appeal. The excluded\nportion indicates that Ford gave his testimony while hospitalized for a physical illness.\n\f                                                                                           Cade–9\n\ncases. Kessner testified about a mental condition she called “abandonment rage,” which\n\nshe acknowledged was not a diagnosis included in the American Psychiatric\n\nAssociation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Kessner testified that a person\n\nexperiencing “abandonment rage” exists in a state of autonomic arousal. She stated that\n\nsuch arousal limits cognitive processes and can cause an individual to lose control of his\n\nbehavior. Kessner asserted that a person who is experiencing stressors such as depression,\n\nchronic pain, after-effects of childhood and adult trauma, and the threat of losing an\n\nintimate partner would be more likely to enter a state of “abandonment rage” than a\n\nperson not subject to such stressors. She also asserted that an individual experiencing\n\n“abandonment rage” would not know, at the moment of violence, that his conduct was\n\nwrong. Kessner testified that there was a high probability that Appellant suffered from\n\n“abandonment rage.” Kessner acknowledged, however, that she did not personally\n\nexamine Appellant in preparation for her testimony.5 Based on the information she\n\nreviewed, and after vacillating greatly, Kessner ultimately stated that is was her opinion\n\nthat Appellant had a severe mental disease or defect at the time of the offense and did not\n\nknow that his conduct was wrong.\n\n       In rebuttal, the State presented the testimony of Tim Proctor, Ph.D., a forensic\n\npsychologist. Dr. Proctor testified that he has worked as an expert witness for both the\n\n\n\n       5\n        Kessner testified that she relied on the report prepared by the State’s expert witness, Tim\nProctor; the notebook found at the crime scene; some letters written by Appellant after the\noffense; conversations with defense counsel; and some professional literature.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–10\n\nState and the defense. Proctor also stated that he personally evaluated Appellant for over\n\nfive hours and conducted a comprehensive record review. That review included records\n\nof the instant offense, including police reports, Appellant’s 9-1-1 call, and Appellant’s\n\nsubsequent statements to police; the psychological evaluation conducted by mental-health\n\nstaff at the jail immediately following Appellant’s arrest; records of Appellant’s mental-\n\nhealth treatment while awaiting trial; police, community supervision, and prison records\n\nassociated with Appellant’s prior arrests and convictions; Appellant’s school,\n\nemployment, and medical records; and the mental-health records of Appellant’s father.\n\nProctor testified that clinical notes reflected the staff’s observations that Appellant\n\nmisrepresented, exaggerated, or completely lied about his mental condition in order to be\n\nmoved to a preferred-housing area. The notes further memorialized Appellant’s\n\nadmission that he cut his own wrist to make it look as if he were suicidal, so that jail\n\nofficials would transfer him from the administrative-segregation housing unit.\n\n       Proctor told the jury that, before the offense, Appellant showed some depressive\n\nsymptoms due to a back injury, but the symptoms did not rise to the level of a severe\n\nmental disease or defect or “anywhere close.” Following the killings and Appellant’s\n\nincarceration on capital-murder charges, psychological staff at the jail diagnosed\n\nAppellant with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and treated him with the lowest\n\nsuggested therapeutic dose of a common antidepressant. Proctor described Appellant’s\n\ndepression as mild and stated that the adjustment disorder reflected Appellant’s reaction\n\nto his current legal difficulties. Proctor also testified that neither of Appellant’s current\n\f                                                                                       Cade–11\n\ndiagnoses reached the level of a severe mental disease, and he opined that Appellant had\n\nno severe mental disease or defect at the time of the offense. Therefore, Proctor\n\nconcluded, Appellant knew when he killed Fuller and Desaree that what he was doing\n\nwas wrong.\n\n       After reviewing all of the relevant evidence in a neutral light, we cannot conclude\n\nthat Appellant’s evidence of insanity greatly outweighed the contrary evidence such that it\n\nrenders the jury’s determination manifestly unjust, conscience-shocking, or clearly biased.\n\nMatlock, 392 S.W.3d at 671. Point of error seven is overruled.\n\n       In point of error two, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by not admitting\n\nFord’s entire videotaped deposition into evidence over the State’s relevance objection.\n\nSee T EX. R. E VID. 401, 402. Appellant asserts that the excluded portion of the deposition,\n\nin which Ford discussed his own mental-health history, was relevant to Appellant’s\n\ninsanity defense. Appellant alleges that the trial judge’s failure to admit Ford’s entire\n\ndeposition violated his Sixth Amendment right to due process by impeding his ability to\n\npresent a complete defense. In point of error three, relying on the same arguments,\n\nAppellant alleges that the trial court erred by sustaining the State’s relevance objection to\n\nthe proposed testimony of Lilly Mae Ware, Ford’s niece and caretaker.\n\n       When a trial court sustains the State’s objection to the admission of a defendant’s\n\nevidence, a federal due process violation may arise only if (1) a state evidentiary rule\n\ncategorically and arbitrarily prohibits the defendant from offering otherwise relevant,\n\nreliable evidence vital to his defense; or (2) the trial court’s clearly erroneous ruling\n\f                                                                                     Cade–12\n\nresults in the exclusion of admissible evidence that forms the vital core of a defendant’s\n\ntheory of defense and effectively prevents him from presenting that defense. Easley v.\n\nState, 424 S.W.3d 535, 540 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (quoting Walters v. State, 247\n\nS.W.3d. 204, 219 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). Appellant does not contend that a state\n\nevidentiary rule categorically and arbitrarily prohibited him from offering the testimony at\n\nissue. Therefore, we consider only whether the trial court’s rulings that excluded the\n\nremainder of Ford’s deposition and Ware’s proposed testimony were clearly erroneous\n\nand whether the excluded evidence was so vital to Appellant’s insanity defense that its\n\nexclusion effectively prevented him from presenting that defense. See id.\n\n       In his excluded deposition testimony, Ford stated that he had been diagnosed with\n\nschizophrenia and bipolar disorder in his late twenties, he had been hospitalized many\n\ntimes due to those conditions, and he had been prescribed various psychiatric medications\n\nto treat his illnesses. Ford also described his disordered-thought processes and auditory\n\nand visual hallucinations. Ford testified that his parents had no history of mental illness\n\nand that none of his nine children had been diagnosed with any mental illness. Ware\n\nproposed to testify about the history and characteristics of Ford’s mental illnesses and\n\noffer her opinion that six of Ford’s children, including Appellant, had mental illness. But\n\nin her proffered testimony, Ware admitted that she was not trained to diagnose mental\n\nillnesses and had spent no significant time with Appellant.\n\n       Appellant is not entitled to relief. The trial court’s rulings excluding the remainder\n\nof Ford’s deposition and Ware’s proposed testimony on relevance grounds were not an\n\f                                                                                      Cade–13\n\nabuse of discretion. Shuffield v. State, 189 S.W.3d 782, 793 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\nFurther, the trial court’s rulings did not impede Appellant’s ability to present his insanity\n\ndefense. See Easley, 424 S.W.3d at 540. The issue central of Appellant’s insanity defense\n\nwas whether, at the time of the offense and as the result of a severe mental disease or\n\ndefect, Appellant did not know that his conduct was wrong. The excluded testimony\n\ncentered on Ford’s mental health, not Appellant’s. Appellant presented no evidence that,\n\nlike Ford, he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In addition, the\n\njury learned of Ford’s mental-health history and diagnoses through other witnesses,\n\nincluding Appellant’s half-brother and Dr. Altman. Points of error two and three are\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error four, Appellant alleges that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nnot allowing Dr. Antoinette McGarrahan, a forensic neuropsychologist, to testify at the\n\nguilt-innocence phase that Appellant exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder\n\n(PTSD) and depression and that he scored in the borderline range of intellectual\n\nfunctioning.\n\n       The trial court held a hearing to determine the admissibility of McGarrahan’s\n\ntestimony. McGarrahan stated that she did not evaluate Appellant for insanity at the time\n\nof the offense and had no opinion on that issue. Based on her evaluation and testing of\n\nAppellant, McGarrahan planned to testify that Appellant had borderline-to-low-average\n\nintellectual functioning and exhibited some symptoms associated with depression and\n\nPTSD. McGarrahan stated that Appellant obtained an IQ score of 80 during her testing,\n\f                                                                                         Cade–14\n\nbut she also stated that she had no opinion regarding whether Appellant’s IQ rendered\n\nhim unable to understand that his conduct was wrong at the time of the offense.6\n\n\n       6\n         Although McGarrahan declined to render an opinion as to whether Appellant’s IQ score\nof 80 allowed him to understand that his conduct was wrong at the time of the offense, she did\nmake general statements with respect to a person with an IQ of approximately 80,\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. With respect to Mr. Cade’s IQ being an 80 -- and that’s\n       what your testimony is; is that correct?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Yes, that’s what he tested at.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Are you representing in your opinion that that is a severe\n       mental disease or defect?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: No, I’m not.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: And is it your -- so that is not your opinion?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Correct.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Have you ever rendered an opinion saying that an IQ of 80\n       would be a severe mental disease or defect?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: No.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Is a person with an IQ of 80 able to discern right from wrong?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Based solely on their intellect, yes.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: So there’s nothing with respect to his IQ that would relate to\n       an opinion of yours that at the time of the offense he did or did not have a severe\n       mental disease or defect or that he was or was not able to understand what he was\n       doing was wrong?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Correct.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: And with respect to mental retardation, you are in no way\n       saying the defendant is mentally retarded, are you?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: That’s correct.\n\f                                                                                    Cade–15\n\nMcGarrahan found that Appellant exhibited a depressed affect during her evaluation, but\n\nshe did not know when the symptoms first appeared or whether they played a role in his\n\ncommission of the offense. She also believed that it was possible that most of Appellant’s\n\ndepressive symptoms stemmed from the fact that he was incarcerated and facing capital-\n\nmurder charges. McGarrahan additionally acknowledged that she did not actually\n\ndiagnose Appellant with PTSD, she did not know when the PTSD-like symptoms first\n\nappeared, she could not exclude the possibility that his symptoms could be entirely due to\n\nhis recent commission of a double homicide, and she did not know whether the symptoms\n\nplayed any role in his commission of the offense.\n\n       The trial judge’s decision to exclude McGarrahan’s testimony at the guilt-\n\ninnocence phase due to lack of relevance fell well within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. Shuffield, 189 S.W.3d at 793. McGarrahan had no opinion regarding\n\nwhether Appellant was insane at the time of the killing—the purpose for which Appellant\n\noffered her testimony. See Easley, 424 S.W.3d at 540. Point of error four is overruled.\n\n            III. S UFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE—F UTURE DANGEROUSNESS\n\n       In point of error fifteen, Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsustain the jury’s affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. The\n\nfuture-dangerousness special issue requires the jury to determine “whether there is a\n\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Can you categorically say the defendant is not mentally\n       retarded?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Yes.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–16\n\nprobability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would\n\nconstitute a continuing threat to society.” Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1). When reviewing the\n\nlegal sufficiency of the evidence supporting an affirmative answer to the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict. Williams v. State, 273 S.W.3d 200, 213 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); see Jackson v.\n\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318–19 (1979). Assessing the evidence and all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict, we determine whether any\n\nrational trier of fact could have believed beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a\n\nprobability the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. Williams, 273 S.W.3d. at 213.\n\n       Both the facts of the offense and other evidence showing Appellant’s escalating\n\npattern of violence and disrespect for the law were sufficient to support the jury’s\n\naffirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. See Swain v. State, 181\n\nS.W.3d 359, 370 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005); see also Devoe v. State, 354 S.W.3d 457,\n\n461–62 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). Regarding the facts of the offense, we have recognized\n\nthat a stabbing death is particularly brutal. King v. State, 953 S.W.2d 266, 272 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1997). “[A] knife is a weapon which by its very nature, forces the user to be\n\nin such close proximity to his victim that he is often touching him or comes into contact\n\nwith him on each blow.” Id. (quoting Martinez v. State, 924 S.W.2d 693, 696 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1996)). Further, “the character of the weapon is such that several thrusts are often\n\f                                                                                      Cade–17\n\nutilized in order to ensure death—each additional thrust potentially indicating to any\n\nrational juror that such a personal act requires a wanton and callous disregard for human\n\nlife.” Id.\n\n        Here, the evidence showed that Appellant stabbed Fuller twenty-eight times and\n\nDesaree thirty-nine times, using great force to inflict deep, painful wounds. By\n\nAppellant’s own estimate, Fuller and Desaree both had between thirty and forty minutes\n\nto experience the pain and terror of his attack before they died. For Fuller, this interval\n\nincluded a vaginal and anal sexual assault while she was dying but still conscious and\n\nable to experience pain and fear. While sexually assaulting Fuller, Appellant was aware\n\nthat Desaree was still alive, within close proximity of her mother’s ongoing sexual\n\nassault, and sufficiently conscious to speak. In short, the sheer brutality and depravity of\n\nthe killings could convince a jury that Appellant poses a future danger to society. Even if\n\nthe jury had been inclined to find that Appellant’s conduct stemmed from an isolated\n\nincident of rage, it could have rationally concluded from the results that Appellant’s “rage\n\nis of such an uncontrollable and extreme nature that he is a continuing danger to society.”\n\nSonnier v. State, 913 S.W.2d 511, 517 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).\n\n        But the jury also heard evidence concerning Appellant’s prior criminal history,\n\nwhich included a 1987 juvenile adjudication of delinquent conduct for burglary of a\n\nhabitation, evidence that Appellant committed aggravated assault with a deadly weapon\n\nwhen he shot a man named Edward Watts with a shotgun in 1993, and a 1999 conviction\n\f                                                                                       Cade–18\n\nfor the aggravated sexual assault of Charity Trice. See Young v. State, 283 S.W.3d 854,\n\n864 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (noting that evidence the defendant had previously\n\ncommitted aggravated sexual assault supported the jury’s finding of future\n\ndangerousness); King, 953 S.W.2d at 271–72 (recognizing the commission of burglary of\n\na habitation as evidence tending to show future dangerousness). Trice testified that, when\n\nshe was twenty-one-years old, she met Appellant in a laundromat and exchanged numbers\n\nwith him. Eventually, she invited Appellant to have drinks with her and her co-workers\n\nafter work. Trice rode to the bar with a co-worker and was there for between one and two\n\nhours before asking Appellant to drive her home. Trice had a new apartment, was proud\n\nof it, and invited Appellant in to see it. After they talked for a bit, Trice went into her\n\nbedroom and closed the door to pack because she intended to stay the night at a friend’s\n\nhouse.\n\n         As she went to the front door to leave her apartment, Appellant grabbed her arm\n\nand refused to let her leave. Trice testified that Appellant told her that he “wanted [her]\n\npussy” and threw her to the ground. When Trice tried to fight him, Appellant told her,\n\n“Don’t make me kill you like the last girl.” Because Trice believed Appellant would kill\n\nher if she did not yield to his advances, she pretended to welcome the sexual contact and\n\nled Appellant into her bedroom to get him as far from the front door as possible so she\n\ncould escape. In the bedroom, Appellant never let go of her wrist as he made her remove\n\nher clothing and then engaged in vaginal intercourse with her. Afterward, Appellant\n\f                                                                                    Cade–19\n\nforced Trice to stand over him as he performed oral sex on her.\n\n       The moment Trice felt she could safely escape, she wrapped herself in a blanket\n\nbecause she was naked and ran to a neighbor’s apartment where she waited for police.\n\nTrice sustained injuries to her wrist, chin, hands, and forehead. Appellant had left the\n\nscene by the time police arrived, but he left a message on Trice’s answering machine the\n\nnext day apologizing for the previous night. Appellant was convicted by a jury and\n\nsentenced to three years’ community supervision. As a condition of his community\n\nsupervision, Appellant served ninety days in jail. He was also required to register as a sex\n\noffender and attend a sex-offender treatment program.\n\n       The jury also heard evidence of Appellant’s behavior and attitude following his\n\naggravated-sexual-assault conviction. Mercedes Sabal, Appellant’s community-\n\nsupervision officer for that offense, asserted that, while Appellant was incarcerated, he\n\nwas critical of his past decisions and expressed willingness to adhere to his community-\n\nsupervision conditions. However, following Appellant’s release from jail, he “had an\n\nabout face,” told Sabal he would not adhere to the conditions, and denied his guilt,\n\ncontending that Trice consented to their encounter.\n\n       Al Merchant led the sex-offender treatment program that Appellant was required\n\nto attend. Merchant testified that, during the initial assessment, he found Appellant to be\n\nextremely manipulative. Appellant denied having sexually assaulted Trice, asserting that\n\nhe and Trice were engaged in consensual sex when her boyfriend or husband interrupted\n\f                                                                                         Cade–20\n\nthem. Merchant testified that at the first group session, Appellant continued to maintain\n\nhis innocence. Appellant also attempted to cry in front of the group, a behavior that\n\nMerchant surmised was not a genuine emotional response and further exemplified\n\nAppellant’s willingness to try to manipulate people. Appellant skipped his second session.\n\nAt his third session, which was ultimately his last session, Appellant was evasive,\n\nargumentative, disruptive, and manipulative. As a result, Merchant testified, he\n\nterminated Appellant from the program. In the discharge summary, Merchant wrote that\n\nAppellant’s recidivism risk was extremely high.\n\n       Following Appellant’s termination from the treatment program, the court revoked\n\nhis community supervision and sentenced him to three years in prison. Appellant’s\n\ndisciplinary records while incarcerated showed that Appellant was found in possession of\n\ncontraband and had an altercation with another inmate, during which Appellant suffered a\n\nblack eye and the other inmate suffered a fractured thumb.\n\n       The jury additionally heard evidence that, in 1993, Appellant asked his cousin,\n\nAshton Scott,7 to help him confront a man named Edward Watts. When the two men\n\nfound Watts, Watts pointed a gun at them and Ashton left. After someone later shot Watts\n\nin the back, police officers arrested Ashton for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nAfter making bail, Ashton confronted Appellant, who admitted to shooting Watts with a\n\nshotgun. Ashton asked Appellant to confess to the police, but Appellant refused. The\n\n\n\n       7\n           To distinguish him from Gregory Scott, we hereafter refer to Ashton Scott as “Ashton.”\n\f                                                                                       Cade–21\n\npolice eventually dropped the charges against Ashton, and no one was convicted for\n\nshooting Watts. Ashton also testified that, in 2002, Appellant hit their uncle in the face\n\nwith a beer bottle during an altercation, and that his uncle bled profusely.\n\n       Bobbi Jo Klute dated Appellant off and on for a few years in the mid 1990s. Klute\n\ntestified that, while they were dating, Appellant threw a beer bottle at her vehicle\n\nwindshield after the two argued in her car. She also stated that, during a period that they\n\nwere not dating, Klute was at her father’s house with a male friend when Appellant\n\nkicked in the door, entered the living room, and assaulted Klute’s friend. On another\n\noccasion, Klute and her son were visiting her son’s father, and although Klute and\n\nAppellant were not dating at the time, Appellant showed up, knocked on the door, and\n\nasked her to leave with him. Klute did so to avoid a confrontation. Appellant sometimes\n\ntold Klute that if he could not have her, no one could. Klute grew afraid of Appellant and\n\ntried to end their relationship permanently, but Appellant refused to accept the decision\n\nand harassed her for months. He would call Klute from a pay phone located near her\n\nhouse, follow her, and enter her home without her permission while she was away.\n\n       Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. Point of\n\nerror fifteen is overruled.\n\n                    IV. R EMAINING GUILT– INNOCENCE ALLEGATIONS\n\n       In point of error one, Appellant claims that the trial court erred by permitting\n\f                                                                                           Cade–22\n\ntwo witnesses to testify that, in March 2011, Fuller told them that Appellant had\n\nthreatened her when she asked him to move out. Appellant contends that the testimony\n\nconstituted inadmissible hearsay;8 violated the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause\n\nunder Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 42 (2004); and was unfairly prejudicial\n\nunder Rule 403 of the Texas Rules of Evidence.9 This point of error is multifarious\n\nbecause it is based on more than one legal theory. T EX. R. A PP. P. 38.1; Davis v. State,\n\n329 S.W.3d 798, 820 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). However, we will review Appellant’s\n\nallegations in the interest of justice.\n\n       The witnesses in question were Elena Belcher, Fuller’s mother, and Sandra\n\nHopkins, Fuller’s friend. The trial court permitted Belcher to testify that, shortly before\n\nher death, Fuller said she was going to replace her smoke detector and install a house\n\nalarm because, when Fuller had asked Appellant to move out of her house, Appellant\n\nthreatened to burn the house down with Fuller in it. The trial court allowed Hopkins to\n\ntestify about a conversation with Fuller, during which Fuller made substantially similar\n\nstatements to her.\n\n\n\n       8\n          “‘Hearsay’ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the\ntrial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” TEX . R. EVID .\n801(d).\n       9\n         Rule 403 provides that, “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\nmisleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative\nevidence.” TEX . R. EVID . 403. Unless otherwise stated, all future references to “Rules” refer to\nthe Texas Rules of Evidence.\n\f                                                                                      Cade–23\n\n       Even assuming that the trial court erred by overruling Appellant’s hearsay and\n\nRule 403 objections, the error did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights. See T EX. R.\n\nA PP. P. 44.2(b). The evidence of Appellant’s guilt was overwhelming without Belcher’s\n\nand Hopkins’s objected-to testimony. In addition, the relevant testimony did not\n\nmaterially weaken Appellant’s affirmative defense of insanity. In short, the testimony did\n\nnot have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s verdict.\n\nSee Coble v. State, 330 S.W.3d 253, 280 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\n       Appellant’s Confrontation Clause argument also lacks merit. In Crawford, the\n\nSupreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of testimonial\n\nhearsay, and it stated that, at a minimum, the term “testimonial” applies to police\n\ninterrogations and prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a\n\nformer trial. See Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68; Woods v. State, 152 S.W.3d 105, 113 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2004). Accordingly, our threshold inquiry is whether the statements at issue\n\nwere testimonial or nontestimonial. The record shows that Fuller’s statements to Belcher\n\nand Hopkins were casual remarks that she made to her mother and a friend. We have\n\npreviously determined that similar casual remarks to acquaintances are nontestimonial for\n\nCrawford purposes. See Woods, 152 S.W.3d at 114. Point of error one is overruled.\n\n       In point of error five, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred in admitting\n\nState’s Exhibits 109–113 (crime scene photographs) over his Rule 403 objection.\n\nAppellant contends that the photographs were unfairly prejudicial because they were\n\f                                                                                     Cade–24\n\ngraphic and in color, most showed Fuller’s breasts and genitals, and the State had\n\nminimal need for the them. Appellant asserts that the sexual-assault evidence was not\n\nessential to the State’s case because the indictment did not charge him with having\n\nmurdered Fuller in the course of committing sexual assault.\n\n       The record shows that Appellant did not object to the admission of the photograph\n\nmarked as State’s Exhibit 111. Thus, Appellant did not preserve any alleged error for our\n\nreview regarding that exhibit. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1.\n\n       Regarding the remaining exhibits, Rule 403 requires that a photograph possess\n\nsome probative value and that its inflammatory nature not substantially outweigh that\n\nvalue. Williams v. State, 301 S.W.3d 675, 690 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). We review a trial\n\ncourt’s admission of photographs over a Rule 403 objection for an abuse of discretion. Id.\n\nWe examine several factors, including the photographs’ probative value, their potential to\n\nimpress the jury in some irrational and indelible way, the time needed to develop the\n\nevidence, and the proponent’s need for the photographs. Prible v. State, 175 S.W.3d 724,\n\n733 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). We also consider the number of photographs, their\n\ngruesomeness, their level of detail, their size, whether they are in color or black-and-\n\nwhite, whether they are close-ups, whether they depict a clothed or nude body, the\n\navailability of other means of proof, and other circumstances unique to the individual\n\ncase. Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 690. When elements of a photograph are genuinely helpful\n\nto the jury in making its decision and the photograph’s power “emanates from nothing\n\f                                                                                     Cade–25\n\nmore than what the defendant himself has done[,] we cannot hold that the trial court has\n\nabused its discretion merely because it admitted the evidence.” Sonnier, 913 S.W.2d at\n\n519; see Prible, 175 S.W.3d at 734 n.20.\n\n       The record shows that police officers found Fuller’s body lying face-down on the\n\nmaster bedroom floor and naked below the waist. A bottle of lubricant lay next to Fuller’s\n\nbody. Her buttocks and vaginal area were elevated by pillows. The photographs at issue\n\nare in color and measure roughly 8 ½ x 12 inches. They reflect Fuller’s body as it\n\nappeared after forensic personnel lifted her shirt and rolled her body over to gauge the\n\nextent of her injuries. To the extent that Fuller’s body is shown in these photographs, she\n\nis on her back and naked except for a shirt that is pulled above her breasts.\n\n       State’s Exhibit 109 shows Fuller’s face and body to the knees. There are stab\n\nwounds on Fuller’s face, on the area between her breasts, on her right shoulder and upper\n\nchest area, and on her upper and lower right arm. A relatively small amount of blood is\n\nvisible on Fuller’s skin. Heavier blood stains appear on her shirt, the bedding material\n\nunderneath her, and the adjacent carpet. A bottle of lubricant near the body is partially\n\nvisible at the edge of the photograph. State’s Exhibit 110 is a closer view of Fuller’s\n\ntorso, from her navel to just below her chin. Wounds on Fuller’s right shoulder and upper\n\narm are visible, but the focus of the photograph is a stab wound between Fuller’s breasts.\n\nAs in State’s Exhibit 109, some blood is visible on Fuller’s skin. The quantity of blood\n\nthat stains Fuller’s shirt is more apparent than in State’s Exhibit 109. State’s Exhibit 112\n\f                                                                                      Cade–26\n\ngives a close-up view of wounds on Fuller’s right shoulder and upper chest area, right-\n\nupper arm, and right forearm. Fuller’s left breast, the blood-stained shirt pulled above the\n\nbreast, and a portion of her neck are visible. State’s Exhibit 113 shows Fuller’s body from\n\nthe neck to the knees. Wounds to the area between her breasts and right arm are visible,\n\nas is blood on her skin and shirt. The photograph is taken from approximately the same\n\ndistance but at a slightly different angle than State’s Exhibit 109. The bottle of lubricant\n\nthat was only partially visible in State’s Exhibit 109 is fully visible in State’s Exhibit 113.\n\n       The photographs showed evidence that was directly relevant to, and probative of,\n\nthe charged offense. Besides showing Fuller’s wounds, the photographs corroborated\n\nAppellant’s statements to police and witness testimony concerning the crime scene. See\n\nPrible, 175 S.W.3d at 731. To the extent that the photographs were also probative of the\n\nsexual assault, they constituted same-transaction contextual evidence. See id. at 732\n\n(“Same-transaction contextual evidence results when an extraneous matter is so\n\nintertwined with the State’s proof of the charged crime that avoiding reference to it would\n\nmake the State’s case incomplete or difficult to understand.”).\n\n       Further, the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the\n\nphotographs’ probative value. Whatever power the photographs possessed emanated\n\nprimarily from what Appellant himself did. See Sonnier, 913 S.W.2d at 519. Under these\n\ncircumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting State’s Exhibits\n\n109, 110, 112, and 113. Point of error five is overruled.\n\f                                                                                      Cade–27\n\n       In point of error six, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred by refusing to give\n\nhis proposed instruction on the lesser-included offense of murder:\n\n       If all of you do not agree by a preponderance of the evidence that as a result\n       of a severe mental disease or defect, the defendant did not know that his\n       conduct was wrong when he intentionally or knowingly caused the death of\n       [Fuller], but all of you agree that by preponderance of the evidence as a\n       result of a severe mental disease or defect, the defendant did not know that\n       his conduct was wrong when he intentionally or knowingly caused the death\n       of [Desaree,] then you will find the defendant not guilty by reason of\n       insanity as to the offense of capital murder [and] then you will consider\n       whether the defendant is guilty of the offense of murder of [Fuller].\n\n       We apply a two-step analysis to determine whether the jury should receive a lesser-\n\nincluded offense instruction. State v. Meru, 414 S.W.3d 159, 162 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\nFirst, we ask whether the lesser-included offense’s elements are included within the proof\n\nnecessary to establish the charged offense’s elements. Id. at 162. If they are, we then\n\ninquire whether the record includes evidence that could allow a rational jury to find the\n\ndefendant guilty of only the lesser-included offense. Id.; see Art. 37.09; Feldman v. State,\n\n71 S.W.3d 738, 750–51 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n\n       Appellant meets the first prong of the test; we have repeatedly held that murder is a\n\nlesser-included offense of capital murder. See, e.g., Smith v. State, 297 S.W.3d 260, 275\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2009). However, Appellant does not satisfy the second prong. Appellant\n\npoints us to the general circumstances of the offense and his statements in which he\n\nprofessed an inability to explain why he killed Desaree. But as the State notes, this\n\nevidence suggests that Appellant lacked a motive to kill Desaree. It does not provide a\n\f                                                                                       Cade–28\n\nrational basis for finding that, due to a severe mental disease or defect, when Appellant\n\nstabbed Desaree thirty-nine times, he did not know that his conduct was wrong.\n\n       Further, the evidence does not support a finding that Appellant’s state of mind\n\nwhen he killed Desaree was different from his state of mind when he killed Fuller. Dr.\n\nProctor, the State’s expert, testified that Appellant was sane during both killings.\n\nAppellant’s expert, Dr. Kessner, opined that Appellant was insane during both killings\n\nbecause he was in a state of “abandonment rage” and autonomic arousal from the moment\n\nFuller screamed (upon seeing Appellant in her bed with a knife) until “the violence\n\nstopped.” For the jury to find Appellant guilty of the lesser-included offense, it would\n\nnecessarily have to disregard both Proctor’s and Kessner’s testimony. It would have to\n\nfind that Appellant was thinking rationally when he began to stab Fuller, but he then\n\nentered a state of autonomic arousal (i.e., became insane) when Desaree entered the\n\nbedroom, and he began stabbing her. He then regained rational thought when he stopped\n\nstabbing Desaree and returned to stabbing Fuller. Finally, he returned to a state of\n\nautonomic arousal (i.e., became insane again) when Desaree began to get up, and he\n\nstabbed her multiple additional times. In short, the evidence could not allow a rational\n\njury to find Appellant guilty of only murder. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 750–51. Point of\n\nerror six is overruled.\n\n                    V. R EMAINING P UNISHMENT-PHASE ALLEGATIONS\n\f                                                                                      Cade–29\n\n       In points of error eight through ten, Appellant challenges the trial court’s rulings\n\nexcluding the punishment-phase testimony of his expert witnesses, Mark Vigen, Ph.D.\n\n(point of error 8) and Jonathan Sorensen, Ph.D. (point of error 9), and admitting the\n\ntestimony of the State’s expert, Travis Turner (point of error 10). Appellant alleges that\n\nthe trial court should have permitted Vigen, a psychologist, to testify that there was a high\n\nprobability that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) could control Appellant\n\nif the jury sentenced him to life without parole. Next, Appellant asserts that the trial court\n\nshould have allowed Sorensen, who holds a criminal-justice doctorate, to testify that\n\nindividuals convicted of homicides involving intimate partners are less likely than other\n\ninmates to commit violence in prison. Finally, Appellant contends that the trial court\n\nshould not have permitted Turner, a TDCJ classification officer, to testify about the types\n\nof weapons that prison inmates make.\n\n       The record shows that Turner first testified at a hearing outside the presence of the\n\njury and later in the presence of the jury during the State’s punishment case-in-chief.\n\nDuring the hearing outside the presence of the jury, Appellant objected on relevance\n\ngrounds to Turner’s proposed testimony about the kinds of inmate-made weapons he had\n\nencountered during his TDCJ career. Appellant argued that other inmates made the\n\nweapons in question, and that Appellant was not imprisoned when the discussed weapons\n\nwere found. The trial court overruled the objection, and Turner was excused. Later, when\n\nthe State recalled Turner in the presence of the jury, Turner testified about TDCJ’s\n\f                                                                                       Cade–30\n\ninmate-classification system, living conditions and restrictions within each classification\n\nof inmate, the general kinds of violence and disciplinary infractions that sometimes occur\n\nin prison, and the kinds of weapons that inmates have made. Turner offered no testimony\n\nrelating specifically to Appellant.\n\n       After the State rested its punishment case, Appellant called Johnny Lindsey to\n\ntestify. Lindsey, who told the jury that he spent twenty-six years in TDCJ for aggravated\n\nsexual assault until being exonerated by DNA testing, testified about the prison\n\nenvironment. On cross-examination, without a defense objection, Lindsey stated that\n\ninmates commonly made and possessed shanks.\n\n       After Lindsey testified, the trial court held a hearing outside the jury’s presence to\n\ndetermine the admissibility of testimony to be offered by defense witnesses S.O. Woods,\n\nSorensen, and Vigen as experts. See T EX. R. E VID. 702. Woods, a retired TDCJ\n\nclassifications officer, proposed to clarify aspects of Turner’s testimony regarding\n\nTDCJ’s inmate-classification system and ability to control inmates. After questioning\n\nWoods briefly, the State indicated that it did not object to his proposed testimony. Next,\n\nSorensen stated that he proposed to testify that inmates convicted of intimate-partner\n\nhomicides are less likely to commit acts of violence in prison than other inmates. The\n\nbasis of Sorensen’s opinion was his research, i.e., a study of TDCJ inmates convicted of\n\ncapital murder, murder, or manslaughter that involved the killing of an intimate partner.\n\n       The trial court continued the hearing to allow Sorensen to retrieve a copy of his\n\f                                                                                    Cade–31\n\nresearch. In the meantime, the jury heard testimony from two defense witnesses, one of\n\nwhom was Woods. On direct examination, Woods testified about TDCJ’s inmate-\n\nclassification system and ability to control inmates. On cross-examination, and without a\n\ndefense objection, Woods testified that prison inmates are very creative and can fashion\n\nalmost anything into a weapon, including shoe laces, combs, and handkerchiefs. Like\n\nTurner, Woods offered no testimony specifically related to Appellant.\n\n       When the hearing resumed, the State elicited testimony from Sorensen that his\n\nstudy was the first of its kind, incomplete, had not been peer reviewed or published, and\n\nno one had replicated his study’s results. Sorensen acknowledged that, although\n\nsuccessful peer review is some indication that a study “seems to look okay,” replication of\n\na study’s results, rather than peer review, validates the study. At the end of Sorensen’s\n\nhearing testimony, the trial court stated that it would review Kelly v. State, 824 S.W.2d\n\n568, 572–73 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992), before deciding whether it would permit Sorensen\n\nto testify before the jury.\n\n       The trial court then heard from Vigen. Vigen stated that he had reviewed some\n\noffense and TDCJ records related to Appellant’s conviction and imprisonment for\n\naggravated sexual assault, but he had not personally examined him. Vigen proposed to\n\ntestify that TDCJ “has a high probability of controlling individual inmates.” He also\n\nstated that he based his opinion on thirty-five years of working as a psychologist in Texas\n\nprisons; five articles on prison violence written by other people including Sorensen;\n\f                                                                                     Cade–32\n\nVigen’s own co-authored article, in which he summarized research “indicating that a\n\nmajority of death row inmates do not exhibit violence in prison even in more open\n\ninstitutional settings”; and Turner’s and Woods’s testimony before the jury. Although\n\nVigen initially asserted that he would not offer an opinion specific to Appellant, he\n\nultimately stated that he would testify that there was a high probability that TDCJ could\n\ncontrol Appellant, in particular. When asked whether he based his opinion on anything\n\nindividual to Appellant, Vigen acknowledged that he had not evaluated Appellant but\n\nnoted that he had listened to Turner’s and Woods’s testimony.\n\n       The State objected to Vigen’s proposed testimony. It argued that Vigen was not\n\n“qualified” to render an opinion about the probability that TDCJ could control Appellant\n\nbecause Vigen had reviewed very little information about the case, had not been present\n\nthroughout the entire trial, and had not interviewed Appellant. Appellant countered that\n\nthe State’s argument concerned the weight to be given to Vigen’s opinion, rather than\n\nVigen’s qualifications to render it. The trial judge ruled Vigen’s testimony was\n\ninadmissible. After recessing to review Kelly, the trial judge also excluded Sorensen’s\n\ntestimony.\n\n       Rule 702 governs the admission of expert testimony. Tillman v. State, 354 S.W.3d\n\n425, 435 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). It states, “If scientific, technical, or other specialized\n\nknowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\n\nissue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n\f                                                                                          Cade–33\n\neducation may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.” Rule 702. For\n\nevidence to be admissible under Rule 702, the proponent must demonstrate by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that the expert testimony is sufficiently reliable and relevant to assist\n\nthe jury in reaching accurate results. Everitt v. State, 407 S.W.3d 259, 263 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2013).\n\n       Reliability in this context “refers to the scientific basis for the expert testimony.”\n\nId. (citing Jordan v. State, 928 S.W.2d 550, 553–54 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996)). Where, as\n\nin Appellant’s case, the expertise involves a “soft” science,10 the proponent may establish\n\nreliability by showing that (1) the field of expertise at issue is a legitimate one, (2) the\n\nsubject matter of the expert’s testimony falls within the scope of that field, and (3) the\n\nexpert’s testimony properly relies on or utilizes the principles involved in that field. See\n\nNenno v. State, 970 S.W.2d 549, 561 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998). In making its admissibility\n\ndetermination, the trial court may consider seven other factors that potentially affect\n\nreliability: (1) the extent to which the underlying scientific theory and technique are\n\naccepted as valid by the relevant scientific community, if such community can be\n\nascertained; (2) the testifying expert’s qualifications; (3) the existence of literature\n\nsupporting or rejecting the underlying scientific theory; (4) the technique’s potential rate\n\n\n\n       10\n          Weatherred v. State, 15 S.W.3d 540, 542 n.5 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (“The ‘hard’\nsciences, areas in which precise measurement, calculation, and prediction are generally possible,\ninclude mathematics, physical science, earth science, and life science. The ‘soft’ sciences, in\ncontrast, are generally thought to include such fields as psychology, economics, political science,\nanthropology, and sociology.”).\n\f                                                                                         Cade–34\n\nof error; (5) the availability of other experts to test and evaluate the technique; (6) the\n\nclarity with which the underlying scientific technique can be explained to the court; and\n\n(7) the experience and skill of the person who applied the technique on the occasion in\n\nquestion. State v. Medrano, 127 S.W.3d 781, 784 n.4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\n       “Relevance refers to the ‘fit’ of the scientific principles to the evidence at hand.”\n\nEveritt, 407 S.W.3d at 263. “Relevance is a looser notion than reliability and is a simpler,\n\nmore straightforward matter to establish.” Tillman, 354 S.W.3d at 438 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); see Jordan, 928 S.W.2d at 555 (noting that expert testimony is relevant\n\nunder Rule 702 if it will assist the trier of fact and is sufficiently tied to the facts of the\n\ncase). Although relevance is the less demanding of the two required showings for\n\nadmissibility under Rule 702, we have emphasized that the proponent will not always\n\nsatisfy it. See Jordan, 928 S.W.2d at 555. “[T]he issue under the reliability and relevance\n\nconditions is whether the expert’s testimony took into account enough of the pertinent\n\nfacts to be of assistance to the trier of fact on a fact in issue.” Vela v. State, 209 S.W.3d\n\n128, 133 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude expert testimony for an\n\nabuse of discretion. Tillman, 354 S.W.3d at 435. We will not reverse if the trial court’s\n\ndecision falls within the zone of reasonable disagreement or is correct under any theory of\n\nlaw applicable to the case. State v. Esparza, 413 S.W.3d 81, 85 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\n       Appellant contends that the trial court should have permitted Vigen to testify about\n\f                                                                                     Cade–35\n\nTDCJ’s ability to control Appellant because Vigen reviewed, and based his opinion on,\n\nAppellant’s prison records, some offense reports concerning Appellant’s aggravated-\n\nsexual-assault conviction, Woods’s and Turner’s testimony, and relevant research in his\n\nfield. Alternatively, Appellant asserts that the trial court should have permitted Vigen to\n\ntestify through answers to hypotheticals that Appellant would not be a future danger in\n\nprison.\n\n          To the extent Vigen proposed to testify about the probability that TDCJ could\n\ncontrol Appellant, the trial court’s ruling fell within the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\nThe record does not support Appellant’s assertion that Vigen based his opinion on any\n\ninformation specific to Appellant. At the admissibility hearing, the State asked Vigen\n\nrepeatedly about the bases for his opinion, and Vigen responded by listing his own\n\nexperience, articles that were not specific to Appellant, and Turner’s and Woods’s\n\ntestimony before the jury. Vigen did not include his review of Appellant’s prison record\n\nand offense reports related to Appellant’s aggravated-sexual-assault conviction as a basis\n\nfor his opinions. Further, neither Turner nor Woods offered testimony specific to\n\nAppellant. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it precluded Vigen from\n\ntestifying about the probability that TDCJ could control Appellant.\n\n          To the extent Appellant argues that the trial court should have allowed Vigen to\n\ntestify via hypotheticals that Appellant would not be a future danger in prison, the record\n\ndoes not show that Appellant suggested this alternative to the trial court. In responding to\n\f                                                                                     Cade–36\n\nthe State’s objection to Vigen’s proposed testimony, defense counsel argued:\n\n       Many times mental health professionals are given hypotheticals and asked\n       to render opinions about future dangerousness and [sic] certainly qualifies\n       within that category and meets the test of [Nenno] on the soft sciences that\n       he’s qualified to give an expert opinion. Any objection would go to the\n       weight. There’s no question about his qualifications and he’s been qualified\n       to testify in other death penalty cases [sic] the same or similar type of\n       issues.\n\nAlthough counsel mentioned the word “hypotheticals,” it was in the context of an\n\nargument that the trial court should allow Vigen to testify that TDCJ would be able to\n\ncontrol Appellant. The trial court cannot be fairly expected to have known from counsel’s\n\nargument that, if the trial court did not allow Vigen to testify about TDCJ’s ability to\n\ncontrol Appellant, then Appellant wished to put Vigen on the stand to testify about\n\nAppellant’s future dangerousness via hypotheticals. And when the trial court ruled that\n\nVigen’s testimony was inadmissible, Appellant did not seek clarification of the ruling’s\n\nscope. To the extent he would have otherwise presented Vigen’s testimony in the form of\n\nhypotheticals, Appellant failed to preserve any complaint. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1(a).\n\nPoint of error eight is overruled.\n\n       Sorensen proposed to offer an opinion based on the results of a novel and\n\nincomplete study that had not been peer-reviewed, published, or replicated. The trial court\n\nacted within its discretion when it found Sorensen’s testimony inadmissible under Rule\n\n702. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 277–80; Medrano, 127 S.W.3d at 784 n.4. Point of error\n\f                                                                                          Cade–37\n\nnine is overruled.11\n\n       We do not reach the merits of point of error ten concerning the admission of\n\nTurner’s testimony because, even if it was error for the trial court to admit Turner’s\n\ntestimony, Appellant was not harmed by that admission. “[W]hen a defendant offers the\n\nsame testimony as that objected to, or the same evidence is introduced from another\n\nsource, without objection, the defendant is not in position to complain on appeal.” See\n\nHughes v. State, 878 S.W.2d 142, 156 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (quoting Stoker v. State,\n\n788 S.W.2d 1, 13 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989)). Although Appellant objected to Turner’s\n\ntestimony concerning weapons made by inmates, he did not object when Lindsey and\n\nWoods gave substantially the same testimony. Point of error ten is overruled.\n\n       In point of error eleven, Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied\n\nhis request for a mistrial after Sabal, his former community-supervision officer, testified\n\nthat he failed a polygraph while on community supervision for aggravated sexual assault.\n\nAlthough polygraph evidence is generally not admissible in Texas courts, the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion by denying Appellant’s motion for mistrial. See Ex parte\n\nBryant, 448 S.W.3d 29, 40 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014); Leonard v. State, 385 S.W.3d 570,\n\n573 n.2 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).\n\n\n       11\n          In response to Appellant’s eighth and ninth points of error, the State Prosecuting\nAttorney’s Office has filed a postsubmission brief urging this Court to overrule Berry v. State,\n233 S.W.3d 847 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). The State Prosecuting Attorney argues that our holding\nin Berry is implicated by the question of whether the testimony of Drs. Vigen and Sorensen was\nrelevant. We decline the invitation in this case because, as discussed above, this Court is able to\nresolve both points of error without deciding the relevancy issue.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–38\n\n       Sabal’s complained-of testimony occurred during the State’s direct examination.\n\nSabal testified that, following Appellant’s termination from a mandatory sex-offender-\n\ntreatment program, an arrest warrant issued, and the district attorney filed a motion to\n\nrevoke Appellant’s community supervision. He also asserted that Appellant knew that the\n\ntermination endangered his community supervision and that Appellant acted “to extend\n\nhis stay in the community.” When the prosecutor asked Sabal to explain what she meant\n\nby that phrase, she answered,\n\n       When a sex offender is unsuccessfully discharged from treatment[,] then we\n       need to find another treatment provider that’s going to accept that defendant\n       into their program. That is not an easy thing to do once the offender has\n       been discharged from treatment, especially for the reasons [Appellant] was\n       discharged. . . . [I]t was difficult to find sex offender treatment providers\n       who would accept an offender who was discharged because [he was]\n       denying the offense for which [he] was placed on [community supervision]\n       and had failed a polygraph.\n\nThe defense objected, arguing that Sabal’s statement about the polygraph was irrelevant\n\nand highly prejudicial. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to\n\ndisregard the statement, but it denied Appellant’s subsequent request for a mistrial. The\n\nrecord reveals no further reference to the polygraph result by either party.\n\n       We review a trial court’s denial of a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion,\n\nand will uphold the ruling if it falls within the zone of reasonable disagreement. Coble,\n\n330 S.W.3d at 292. Here, the alleged grounds for mistrial arose from Sabal’s apparently\n\nunanticipated answer to the State’s question. This scenario is most closely aligned with\n\ncases in which a bystander or witness made a spontaneous outburst that interfered with\n\f                                                                                      Cade–39\n\nthe normal proceedings of a trial. See, e.g., id. at 291–92; Gamboa v. State, 296 S.W.3d\n\n574, 580 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); see also Williams v. State, 643 S.W.2d 136, 138 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1982) (discussing a State witness’s unresponsive answer, which inadvertently\n\nplaced information prejudicial to the defendant before the jury). In those instances, we\n\nheld that the denial of a motion for mistrial would not result in reversible error unless the\n\ndefendant showed the existence of a reasonable probability that the outburst interfered\n\nwith the jury’s verdict. Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 292 (citing Stahl v. State, 749 S.W.2d 826,\n\n829 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988) (op. on reh’g)). In the context of bystander or witness\n\noutbursts, we generally consider a trial court’s instructions to disregard sufficient to cure\n\nthe impropriety because we presume that the jury will follow those instructions. Coble,\n\n330 S.W.3d at 292; see also Williams, 643 S.W.2d at 138 (noting the general rule that an\n\ninstruction to disregard is sufficient to cure prejudice from a nonresponsive answer given\n\nby a State’s witness).\n\n       Appellant argues that we should not apply our normal presumption concerning the\n\nsufficiency of an instruction to disregard because Sabal disclosed the results of the\n\npolygraph, as well as the fact that Appellant took such a test. In support, Appellant relies\n\non Robinson v. State, 550 S.W.2d 54, 59–61 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977), Nichols v. State,\n\n378 S.W.2d 335, 338 (Tex. Crim. App. 1964), and Jones v. State, 680 S.W.2d 499, 502\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1983, no pet.). He contends that these cases stand for the proposition\n\nthat an instruction to disregard is insufficient to cure harm when the jury learns of a\n\f                                                                                    Cade–40\n\npolygraph’s results. Relying on United States v. Murray, 784 F.2d 188 (6th Cir. 1986),\n\nAppellant also asserts that we should not apply the presumption because we should\n\nconsider Sabal a government agent who referred to the polygraph’s result in bad faith.\n\nHowever, all of the cases upon which Appellant relies are distinguishable.\n\n       In Robinson and Nichols, the prosecution bolstered the testimony of key guilt-\n\ninnocence phase witnesses concerning the charged offense. Robinson, 550 S.W.2d at 59\n\n(stating that the accomplice-witness’s testimony was vital to the State’s capital-murder\n\nprosecution); Nichols, 378 S.W.2d at 336 (noting that the State’s statutory-rape case\n\ndepended entirely on the 14-year-old complainant’s testimony). The prosecution did so in\n\nNichols by asking the victim if she had taken a polygraph and in Robinson by repeatedly\n\neliciting testimony that these witnesses had taken, and passed, polygraphs regarding their\n\naccounts of the charged offense. See Robinson, 550 S.W.2d at 56–59; Nichols, 378\n\nS.W.2d at 336–37. In Jones, the prosecution impeached the defendant’s punishment-\n\nphase testimony, in which she asserted that she killed the victim accidentally. Jones, 680\n\nS.W.2d at 500–01. It did so by obtaining the defendant’s admission on cross-examination\n\nthat she had taken a polygraph and lied in response to several questions. Id. at 502. The\n\nState also elicited testimony through another witness that the polygraph examiner\n\nbelieved the defendant had lied when she denied her part in the murder. Id. In Murray, an\n\nexperienced FBI agent who investigated the defendant for mail fraud testified at the guilt-\n\ninnocence phase of the defendant’s later trial on those charges. See Murray, 784 F.2d at\n\f                                                                                       Cade–41\n\n188. During his testimony, the agent referred to the fact that the defendant had taken a\n\npolygraph regarding the charged offense. Id. The panel majority found that the agent’s\n\nreference to the test was deliberate and that the trial court’s instruction to disregard the\n\ncomment was inadequate to cure the error. Id. at 188–89.\n\n       In Appellant’s case, the record does not support a finding that the prosecutor’s\n\nquestion was designed to elicit testimony concerning the polygraph or that the prosecutor\n\ncould have reasonably anticipated the reference. Further, the record shows that the\n\nprosecutor did not mention the polygraph or result after Sabal’s fleeting reference. In\n\naddition, Sabal’s reference occurred during the punishment phase, when the potential for\n\nprejudice was less than if it had occurred at the guilt-innocence phase. See Coble, 330\n\nS.W.3d at 293. Also, Sabal’s brief mention of the examination’s result concerned the\n\ncircumstances in which the convicting court revoked Appellant’s community supervision\n\nfor an extraneous offense. Sabal’s reference did not concern a polygraph in which\n\nAppellant or a witness submitted to questioning about the capital murder for which\n\nAppellant was then on trial. The record also does not support Appellant’s assertion that\n\nSabal’s reference to the polygraph and its result was the product of bad faith.\n\n       After review, we find no reasonable probability that Sabal’s objected-to testimony\n\ninterfered with the jury’s punishment verdict. The evidence supporting the jury’s answers\n\nto the punishment-phase special issues was substantial. Sabal’s reference to the\n\npolygraph’s result was brief, unsolicited, and concerned an extraneous matter; further, the\n\f                                                                                     Cade–42\n\nState did not attempt to capitalize upon the reference. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 293.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Appellant has not overcome the presumption that the trial\n\ncourt’s instruction to disregard was sufficient to cure any harm that may have otherwise\n\nresulted from the objectionable testimony. Point of error eleven is overruled.\n\n       In point of error twelve, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by allowing two\n\nof Desaree’s friends, Allison Nelson and Justus Rodgers, to give victim-impact testimony.\n\nAppellant asserts that their testimony was improper because the State did not elicit their\n\ntestimony in response to defense mitigation evidence and because close relatives were\n\navailable to provide victim-impact testimony. But Appellant has failed to preserve this\n\ncomplaint because his argument on appeal does not comport with his objection at trial.\n\nT EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1; Bekendam v. State, 441 S.W.3d 295, 300 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).\n\nAt trial, the sole basis for Appellant’s objection was that Nelson and Rodgers were not\n\nfamily members. The trial court overruled the objection, finding the testimony admissible\n\nunder Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 263 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (concluding that\n\nvictim-impact testimony is not rendered improper merely because the witness is not a\n\nfamily member). Point of error twelve is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirteen, Appellant contends that the trial court erred when it\n\ndeclined to include the following jury instructions in the punishment charge:\n\n       No juror has to agree with [any] other juror as to what is [a] mitigating\n       circumstance or set of circumstances that justifies a sentence of life. The\n       duty to deliberate only requires that each juror give careful consideration to\n       the evidence in the issue that you are to consider to give an individual true\n\f                                                                                       Cade–43\n\n       verdict according to the law and the evidence.\n\n       No juror is to be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture or sympathy for the\n       deceased or family of the deceased, nor are you to consider any prejudice or\n       public opinions or public feeling that may exist against [Appellant] in\n       considering an answer to Special Issue No. 2.\n\n       During your careful consideration of the special issues, each juror is entitled\n       to his or her own personal moral judgment as to the right answer for these\n       issues.\n\nAppellant asserts that the proposed instructions were all part of the law of capital\n\njurisprudence and were necessary to guide the jury so that it would apply the death\n\npenalty in a constitutional manner.\n\n       Appellant’s argument lacks merit. Article 37.071, subsection (e), sets forth the law\n\napplicable to the mitigation special issue. The trial court’s charge tracked that statutory\n\nlanguage. See Martinez, 924 S.W.2d at 699 (“Following the law as it is set out by the\n\nTexas Legislature will not be deemed error on the part of the trial judge.”). Point of error\n\nthirteen is overruled.\n\n       In point of error fourteen, Appellant asserts that the trial court reversibly erred by\n\noverruling his objection to the State’s allegedly improper punishment-phase argument.\n\nAppellant contends that the State misstated the law by suggesting that the death penalty\n\nwould be a proper verdict based only on an affirmative answer to the future-\n\ndangerousness special question. He argues that Texas law “presumes that a life sentence\n\nis appropriate and a death sentence [inappropriate]” unless the jury answers the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue in the affirmative and the mitigation special issue in the\n\f                                                                                      Cade–44\n\nnegative.\n\n       The record shows that, after correctly stating the two special issues, the prosecutor\n\nlinked the evidence presented at trial to them. See Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1), 2(e)(1). The\n\nprosecutor first focused on the offense facts, arguing that the “horrific[,] senseless,\n\nunjustified violence” Appellant had inflicted was relevant to both special issues and\n\nshowed that Appellant was the type of person who “deserv[ed] a death\n\nsentence”—“exactly what Special Issue 1 and 2 are about.” She also drew the jury’s\n\nattention to the evidence of Appellant’s extraneous offenses and other bad acts, arguing\n\nthat they constituted additional reasons for the jury to return an affirmative answer to the\n\nfuture-dangerousness special issue. After asking the jury to return an affirmative answer\n\non future dangerousness, the prosecutor segued into her argument concerning the\n\nmitigation issue:\n\n              The answer to Special Issue No. 1 is yes. What the State of Texas\n       asks [is] that you vote that way, all of you, and you move on to Special\n       Issue No. 2.\n\n              Now on this special issue, we don’t have the burden of proof, [and]\n       neither does the defense. It’s left up to you. And [Special Issue No. 2] really\n       asks you is there anything that is sufficiently mitigating to warrant that he\n       shouldn’t have the death sentence that you’ve already determined that he\n       deserves by the answer of yes to Special Issue No. 1.\n\n       Appellant objected to the last sentence of the passage set forth above, arguing that it\n\nmisstated the law because “the death sentence is not imposed until all questions are\n\nanswered.” The trial court overruled the objection.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–45\n\n       We perceive no misstatement of law. The prosecutor did not argue that Appellant\n\ncould lawfully receive a death sentence based only on an affirmative answer to the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue. The State’s argument was reasonably understood as a\n\nhypothetical, in which it posited that the jury had already answered “yes” to the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue and was beginning to deliberate on the mitigation issue. Once\n\nthe jury has made an affirmative finding concerning future dangerousness, a defendant’s\n\nsentence is presumptively death unless, after considering the mitigating evidence presented\n\nto it, the jury also answers the mitigation special issue in the affirmative or deadlocks on\n\nthat issue. See Art. 37.071, § 2(g). Point of error fourteen is overruled.\n\n                              VI. V OIR DIRE—B ATSON CHALLENGES\n\n       In points of error fifteen and sixteen, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his Batson12 challenges to the State’s use of peremptory strikes against African-\n\nAmerican veniremembers Viola Brimmer and Leamon Parker. Appellant, who is African-\n\nAmerican, contends that racial discrimination motivated the strikes.\n\n       In Batson, the United States Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause\n\nforbids a prosecutor from exercising peremptory strikes based solely on the basis of a\n\npotential juror’s race. Nieto v. State, 365 S.W.3d 673, 675 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). A\n\nBatson challenge involves a three-step process. Blackman v. State, 414 S.W.3d 757, 764\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2013). First, the defendant must make a prima facie showing of racial\n\n\n\n       12\n            Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\n\f                                                                                       Cade–46\n\ndiscrimination. Nieto, 365 S.W.3d at 676. In the second step, the burden of production\n\nshifts to the prosecutor, who must articulate a race-neutral explanation for the strike. Id.\n\nFinally, the trial court determines whether the defendant has proved purposeful\n\ndiscrimination. Id.\n\n       The trial court’s ruling on the purposeful-discrimination step must be upheld unless\n\nit is clearly erroneous. Id. In determining whether clear error occurred, we are not limited\n\nto the arguments or considerations that the parties specifically called to the trial court’s\n\nattention; rather, we look to the entire record of voir dire. Blackman, 414 S.W.3d at 765.\n\nWe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court’s ruling. Young v.\n\nState, 283 S.W.3d 854, 866 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n       The record shows that Brimmer’s individual voir dire took place before Judge Quay\n\nParker.13 Lead prosecutor Heath Harris questioned Brimmer for the State. At the\n\nconclusion of Brimmer’s voir dire, the State exercised the first of its fifteen statutorily\n\ngranted peremptory strikes to remove her from jury service. See Art. 35.15(a). Defense\n\ncounsel responded with a preemptive Batson challenge, noting Brimmer’s race and gender,\n\nand that the State had used its first peremptory strike against a person of a minority race.\n\nHarris and two other members of the prosecution team who were present during\n\nBrimmer’s voir dire—Jason Hermus and Rachel Jones—made a contemporaneous record\n\nof their race-neutral reasons for striking Brimmer.\n\n       13\n        Judge Mark Stoltz presided over Appellant’s trial. In addition to Judge Parker, Judges\nJoseph Clayton, Webb Biard, and Jim Fry assisted Judge Stoltz with individual voir dire.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–47\n\n       Harris stated that he was concerned that Brimmer would demand that the State meet\n\na higher standard of proof than the law required. Harris asserted that Brimmer’s juror-\n\nquestionnaire responses and individual voir dire testimony manifested Brimmer’s belief\n\nthat the death penalty had been applied disproportionately to African-Americans in Texas,\n\ngenerally, and in Dallas County, specifically. Harris also noted that, in her questionnaire\n\nresponses, Brimmer had expressed a clear preference for life without the possibility of\n\nparole over a death sentence. Harris said that Brimmer’s sentencing preference also\n\nmanifested itself during her voir dire through Brimmer’s reluctance to say that she could\n\nanswer the special issues according to the evidence, if doing so would result in a death\n\nsentence:\n\n       And when I asked her on numerous occasions, numerous time after time\n       [sic] trying to get her to commit that if we prove [Appellant guilty of capital\n       murder] and if Special Issue One was answered yes and Special Issue Two\n       was answered no, if she could render a death sentence, she was very, very\n       reluctant in answering. I almost at one point had to move on because I\n       couldn’t get her to say that she would do death over life.\n\n       And I just think that it’s clear from [Brimmer’s voir dire] that there seemed\n       to be a huge reluctance on her part to ever really consider a death sentence\n       versus a life sentence without the possibility of parole, which is what she\n       indicated not only on her questionnaire but also here today. And that’s the\n       primary reason I struck her.\n\n       Hermus stated that he and Jones concurred with Harris on all the reasons Harris had\n\nexpressed to the court. Hermus then gave his additional reasons for striking Brimmer.\n\nHermus stated that he had concerns with Brimmer before her individual voir dire, based on\n\nthe equivocating nature of many of her juror-questionnaire answers, and he offered a\n\f                                                                                     Cade–48\n\nnonexhaustive list of examples: (1) Brimmer was not sure whether she favored the death\n\npenalty, (2) Brimmer wrote “none at this time” when asked to provide the best argument\n\nfor the death penalty, and (3) Brimmer thought conviction of multiple murders was\n\n“possibly” a proper basis for death eligibility. Hermus asserted that Brimmer’s live\n\ntestimony often reflected a similar equivocation. He noted that Brimmer often rephrased\n\nHarris’s questions into what she apparently wanted the question to be, rather than what\n\nHarris had asked.\n\n       Hermus stated that Brimmer’s demeanor during the State’s voir dire also troubled\n\nhim. He observed Brimmer make faces at Harris or grimace on four different occasions\n\nwhen Harris tried to elicit her opinion on the death penalty and ability to impose it.\n\nHermus believed that Brimmer’s facial expressions and accompanying verbal responses\n\nindicated either displeasure with or disdain toward Harris. Alternatively, Hermus believed\n\nthat Brimmer’s expressions and responses reflected her reluctance to answer the special\n\nissues according to the evidence if a death sentence would result. Hermus also noted that\n\nBrimmer said that she had an issue with African-Americans being “railroaded” onto Death\n\nRow. Lastly, Hermus mentioned that Brimmer’s “reluctance initially to [sic] circumstantial\n\nevidence” concerned the prosecution team.\n\n       Jones added that she was also troubled by Brimmer’s hesitation and facial\n\nexpression when Harris asked whether Brimmer could convict someone on the testimony\n\nof one witness, if the witness could testify to every element of the offense and Brimmer\n\f                                                                                    Cade–49\n\nbelieved the witness. Jones asserted that Brimmer’s facial expression and response\n\nindicated disbelief that the State could obtain a conviction for capital murder based on the\n\ntestimony of only one witness. Jones acknowledged that Brimmer qualified her initial\n\nresponse, but Jones asserted that Brimmer’s qualification was also problematic because it\n\nsuggested that Brimmer would require eyewitness testimony:\n\n       [W]hen we talked to her about proving our case with one witness and if she\n       believed that witness, she proceeded to go on -- she had some hesitation\n       about that and, again, her facial expression, saying, how could you only\n       have one witness?\n\n       And then she qualified it by saying, oh, well, if that one witness saw him\n       commit the crime, and managed to get out, before they too were stabbed,\n       well, then okay, then I could do it.\n\n       Jones also cited Brimmer’s responses when Harris discussed the State’s burden of\n\nproof and tried to determine whether Brimmer would increase that burden. Jones asserted\n\nthat Brimmer’s answers were equivocal or uninformative, because Brimmer would\n\nessentially say no more than, “I just expect you to prove it. I would expect you to prove it.”\n\nJones also stated that towards the end of the State’s voir dire, Brimmer expressed the\n\nsentiment that, in her heart, she did not believe in the death penalty.\n\n       After the prosecutors gave their reasons for striking Brimmer, defense counsel\n\nstated that he would reserve questions because the Batson challenge was premature at that\n\nstage of voir dire. Judge Parker agreed that the challenge was premature and denied it,\n\nstating that Appellant could reurge it at a later time.\n\n       A week later, venire member Parker’s individual voir dire took place before Judge\n\f                                                                                       Cade–50\n\nClayton. Harris questioned Parker for the State. At the conclusion of defense counsel’s\n\nvoir dire, prosecutor Jones challenged Parker for cause on two grounds. See Art. 35.16.\n\nFirst, Jones asserted that, although his answers on the issue vacillated somewhat, Parker’s\n\nfinal answer during the State’s voir dire was that the prosecution would have to prove its\n\ncase to a degree that left no doubt in his mind. Jones argued that Parker was, therefore,\n\nrequiring 100% proof from the State—more than proof beyond a reasonable doubt—which\n\nmade him challengeable for cause under Narvaiz v. State, 840 S.W.2d 415, 427 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1992). Second, Jones argued that Parker did not consider circumstantial\n\nevidence to be valid and could not return a guilty verdict based solely on circumstantial\n\nevidence. When these challenges for cause were unsuccessful, Hermus lodged two\n\nadditional challenges for cause based on Parker’s opposition to the death penalty as\n\nexpressed in his juror questionnaire responses and voir dire testimony. Judge Clayton also\n\ndenied the State’s additional challenges for cause.\n\n       The next day, the State used its second peremptory strike to remove Parker from the\n\nvenire. Hermus asked to place the State’s reasons for the strike on the record, in case of a\n\nlater Batson challenge. Hermus stated that the State struck Parker based on his\n\nquestionnaire answers and voir dire testimony. Hermus particularly drew the court’s\n\nattention to Parker’s answers to the following questions:\n\n       •      (Q. 1) Parker indicated that he was not in favor of the death penalty\n              and wrote, “Only God should make that decision.”\n\n       •      (Q. 2) Parker indicated that he did not believe that the death penalty\n\f                                                                             Cade–51\n\n    should ever be imposed, but if the law provided for it, he could\n    assess it under the proper circumstances.\n\n•   (Q. 4–5) Parker asserted that he had moral, religious, or personal\n    beliefs that would prevent him from sitting in judgment of another\n    human being or returning a verdict that would result in another’s\n    execution. In explanation, Parker wrote that “[t]he Bible tells us not\n    to judge others” and returning a verdict that would result in a death\n    sentence “mean[t] I [was] judging another and could cost them their\n    life.”\n\n•   (Q. 7) Parker wrote “none” when asked to provide the best argument\n    for the death penalty.\n\n•   (Q. 8) Parker wrote that “God[’]s word” was the best argument\n    against the death penalty.\n\n•   (Q. 10) Parker disagreed with Texas law to the extent it makes\n    multiple-murder a capital offense.\n\n•   (Q. 11) Parker disagreed that some crimes warrant the death penalty\n    solely because of their severe facts and circumstances, regardless of\n    whether the guilty person has committed prior violent acts. Parker\n    wrote, “If you kill the[n] you are no better than they are.”\n\n•   (Q. 12) Parker disagreed with Texas law to the extent it permits\n    conviction of a crime, including capital murder, based solely on\n    circumstantial evidence, with no eyewitnesses. Parker wrote, “That is\n    not beyond a reasonable doubt to me.”\n\n•   (Q. 14) Parker indicated that he did not believe in an eye for an eye,\n    writing that “God said turn the other cheek.”\n\n•   (Q. 18) Parker indicated that he did not believe that Texas applies the\n    death penalty fairly. Parker wrote, “By statistic[s,] black men are\n    given the death penalty more than whites, therefore I feel it is\n    unfair.”\n\n•   (Q. 20) When asked whether he believed the death penalty is used\n    too often or too seldom, Parker wrote, “Too often, one is too many.”\n\f                                                                                      Cade–52\n\n\n         •     (Q. 130) Parker indicated that he would not want to serve as a juror\n               in Appellant’s case, writing, “Because of the death penalty.”\n\nHermus stated that Parker’s responses to the foregoing questionnaire items reflected a\n\nstrong bias against the death penalty, and Hermus did not believe that Parker could set it\n\naside.\n\n         Based on Parker’s questionnaire responses and voir dire testimony, Jones echoed\n\nHermus’s belief that, despite Parker’s best efforts, he would not be able to overcome his\n\nscruples against the death penalty. Jones added that they were also concerned by the\n\nhesitation and reservations that Parker expressed about circumstantial evidence, as well as\n\nthe burden of proof he would impose on the State,\n\n         And then we asked him, [e]ven if you believe the circumstantial evidence,\n         could you find somebody guilty, he vacillated on that. He said, [t]o me,\n         circumstantial evidence is no proof that there’s a case, and that he would\n         always be concerned that it was somebody else that did it without an\n         eyewitness. . . . [T]here could have been . . . other people involved that\n         would lead to this person being innocent, and that he would want us to\n         prove the case to him to where he would have no doubt in his mind, which\n         is why the State submitted him for a challenge for cause on requiring 100\n         percent proof. He further said that circumstantial evidence, he considers\n         that weak evidence.\n\nJudge Clayton overruled Appellant’s Batson challenge as to Parker, with leave to reurge\n\nthe challenge later in voir dire.\n\n         When the Batson hearing occurred, about halfway through voir dire, the State had\n\nused a total of four strikes, exercising its third and fourth peremptory challenges to remove\n\ntwo white veniremembers, including Linda Schultz. Judge Stoltz presided over the Batson\n\f                                                                                      Cade–53\n\nhearing, assisted by Judge Clayton, who had conducted Parker’s individual voir dire.\n\nAttempting to show that the State’s race-neutral explanations for striking Brimmer and\n\nParker were pretextual, defense counsel asserted that Brimmer, Parker, and a white venire\n\nmember, John Nily, had each indicated on their questionnaires that they “had problems”\n\nwith circumstantial evidence. Defense counsel asserted that the State had questioned Nily\n\ndifferently about the subject by giving him a more full explanation of what such evidence\n\nincludes. Defense counsel examined prosecutors Harris (who had questioned Brimmer and\n\nParker) and Jones (who had questioned Nily), asking them to explain the alleged disparity.\n\n       Harris testified that the general explanation of circumstantial evidence he gave to\n\nveniremembers varied, depending on different factors. Harris stated that the key difference\n\nbetween Brimmer, Parker, and Nily was that, although all three indicated on their\n\nquestionnaires that they had problems with circumstantial evidence, Nily specifically\n\nindicated that he favored the death penalty. In contrast, Parker voiced strong opposition to\n\nthe death penalty and Brimmer indicated uncertainty about the death penalty and a\n\npreference for life without the possibility of parole. Harris testified that the State’s main\n\nconcern with Parker was his very strong opposition to the death penalty. Harris said that\n\nParker’s attitudes toward circumstantial evidence also concerned the State but were\n\nsecondary to Parker’s stance on capital punishment. Harris testified that he tailored his\n\nquestioning of Parker accordingly. Harris also testified that he explained to Parker that\n\ncircumstantial evidence includes DNA and fingerprint evidence.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–54\n\n       Harris testified that Brimmer’s opposition to the death penalty was not as apparent\n\nfrom her questionnaire responses as Parker’s, but it became clear during voir dire that she\n\nstrongly favored life imprisonment without the possibility of parole over a death sentence.\n\nAs to defense counsel’s allegation that he did not explain the concept of circumstantial\n\nevidence to Brimmer, Harris noted that Brimmer was a trained paralegal and mediator who\n\nhad worked for several law firms. Harris testified that Brimmer was not an average juror\n\nand gave no sign of needing the concept explained to her. Moreover, when Harris\n\nexplained other aspects of death-penalty law, Brimmer’s demeanor suggested that she felt\n\ninsulted.\n\n       Harris testified that Brimmer’s legal background and current employment also\n\nfactored into the State’s decision to strike her. Harris stated that the prosecution team\n\nsubjected individuals with legal backgrounds to greater scrutiny due to concern that they\n\nwould be more opinionated and likely to influence other jurors during deliberations. Harris\n\nasserted that Brimmer’s job as an administrative officer for a Veteran’s Hospital was\n\nproblematic, because it potentially brought her into contact with people having mental-\n\nhealth complaints. Harris testified that similar concerns had caused the State to use its\n\nfourth peremptory strike against venire member Schultz, who was white and headed the\n\nspecial-education department for a local high school.\n\n       Defense counsel questioned Jones about her description, during Nily’s voir dire, of\n\ncircumstantial evidence as “almost a trick question.” Jones denied that, by using the term\n\f                                                                                      Cade–55\n\n“trick question,” she had meant that either party had designed questions to trick potential\n\njurors. Jones explained that she used that phrase merely to reassure Nily. Jones stated that\n\nNily had seemed a little intimidated by the process, based on his demeanor on the stand\n\nand statements that he had never been to court or involved in jury selection. When she\n\nasked him about circumstantial evidence, Jones explained:\n\n       [Nily] seemed maybe ashamed . . . when I said, do you know that\n       circumstantial evidence includes things like DNA and fingerprints? [T]he\n       record can’t fully reflect it, but he did one of these like no, just kind of\n       backing away, looking around at everybody.\n\n       And, so, I wanted to reassure him that there was nothing wrong with it, that\n       it is somewhat of a trick question, and I think -- We don’t explain that DNA\n       and fingerprints are circumstantial evidence. Most people don’t think about\n       it in those terms, and that was exactly how it was with him.\n\nDefense counsel asked Jones why the State did not provide the same explanation to\n\nBrimmer and Parker. Jones responded that Harris had given Parker substantially the same\n\nexplanation and that Brimmer did not seem to need an explanation. Jones further testified\n\nthat the State’s main concern during voir dire was always the venire member’s attitudes\n\nabout capital punishment. Jones asserted that Brimmer and Parker held fundamentally\n\ndifferent views from Nily. Jones explained that Brimmer said that she would keep the\n\ndeath penalty if she were governor of Texas, but also stated that, in her heart of hearts, she\n\nbelieved in life imprisonment without the possibility of parole rather than death. Jones\n\nstated that Parker did not believe in the death penalty, but asserted that he was willing to\n\nperform his civic duty, even at the risk of violating his conscience. Jones asserted that\n\f                                                                                    Cade–56\n\nNily, in contrast, testified that he had always believed in the death penalty and would\n\nexpand death eligibility to rapists and repeat child abusers.\n\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Stoltz stated that he had reviewed the\n\ntranscripts of Brimmer’s, Parker’s, and Nily’s individual voir dire. He denied Appellant’s\n\nBatson challenges to Brimmer and Parker, finding that the State’s facially race-neutral\n\nreasons for striking them Brimmer and Parker were genuine and reasonable.\n\n       After twelve jurors had been seated, the defense reurged its Batson challenges to\n\nJudge Stoltz. Defense counsel asserted that, before the Batson hearing, the prosecution\n\nteam had questioned African-American veniremembers differently than they had\n\nquestioned other potential jurors. Counsel argued that, following the Batson hearing, the\n\nprosecutors began to question African-American veniremembers in a way that was more\n\nconsistent with how they questioned other jurors. Counsel averred that the alleged change\n\nsupported the defense’s argument that race motivated the State’s strikes against Brimmer\n\nand Parker. Defense counsel noted that, following the Batson hearing, the parties had\n\naccepted James Brown, an African-American male, as a juror. Counsel offered the\n\ntranscript of Brown’s individual voir dire as an exhibit to support his reurged Batson\n\nchallenges.\n\n       Jones, who had questioned Brown for the State, responded that the State’s\n\nquestioning during individual voir dire was\n\n       a fluid proposition . . . based on the questionnaire. It depends on how the\n       juror answers the questions, it depends on the style of the prosecutor who is\n\f                                                                                        Cade–57\n\n       doing that individual questioning. So yes, some of the questions may\n       change, some may be more in-depth depending on what answer the juror\n       gives, and certainly, as we pointed out before, it all starts with how and\n       whether or not that person believes in the death penalty.\n\n       Mr. Brown has always believed in the death penalty, he talked about that in\n       his questionnaire, talked about that in individual voir dire.\n\n       Mr. Parker on his questionnaire said he did not believe in the death penalty\n       and never has, thereby marking a three [on Question 2]. [Brimmer] marked\n       a two on [Question 2 of] her questionnaire. However, one of the first things\n       she said in voir dire [was] that she did not favor the death penalty or believe\n       in it.\n\nJones asserted “absolutely” that any change in the State’s questioning was due to the way\n\nthe veniremembers answered the questionnaire, rather than the color of their skin. Jones\n\nalso noted that, besides accepting Brown as a juror, the State also accepted Betty Pettway,\n\nRosetta Johnlouis, and Diane Tyler, all of whom were African-American. Jones stated that\n\nPettway was seated as juror, while the defense used peremptory challenges against\n\nJohnlouis and Tyler. After reviewing Brown’s questionnaire and the transcript of his\n\nindividual voir dire, Judge Stoltz again denied Appellant’s Batson challenges.\n\n       After reviewing the entire record of voir dire, we conclude that Appellant is not\n\nentitled to relief. Initially, we note that the State exercised only seven of its fifteen\n\navailable peremptory strikes, using only two of those seven against African-American\n\njurors. It used the other five against white veniremembers. The State also accepted four\n\nAfrican-American veniremembers as jurors, and ultimately two of those individuals served\n\non Appellant’s jury. Further, the record amply supports the race-neutral explanations that\n\f                                                                                        Cade–58\n\nthe prosecution team offered at the time of the strikes, the Batson hearing, and when\n\nAppellant reurged his Batson challenges after twelve jurors had been seated. See Jasper v.\n\nState, 61 S.W.3d 413, 422 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001) (stating that valid and neutral reasons\n\nfor exercising a peremptory challenge include a veniremember’s vacillation regarding his\n\ncapacity to impose the death penalty despite personal beliefs, and numerous answers in a\n\nveniremember’s questionnaire indicating a bias against the imposition of the death\n\npenalty).\n\n       After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court’s ruling, we\n\nconclude that the trial court’s denial of Appellant’s Batson challenges was not clearly\n\nerroneous. Young, 283 S.W.3d at 866. Points of error fifteen and sixteen are overruled.\n\n                  VII. V OIR DIRE—D ENIALS OF CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE\n\n       In points of error eighteen through thirty-four, Appellant alleges that the trial court\n\nerred in denying his challenges for cause to seventeen veniremembers: Jimmy Lumpkins,\n\nBevin Koshy, Chad Newton, Andrew Askins, Veronica Hernandez, Jana Morgan, Pieter\n\nKessels,14 Jennifer Hilburn, Charles Sturgeon, Rosetta Johnlouis, Diana Tyler,15 Tiffany\n\nLangdon, Camille Sowden, Karen Evans, Patti Matthews, Gaylord O’Con, and Kenneth\n\nAdair. The record shows that Appellant exhausted his fifteen peremptory strikes, using\n\n\n\n       14\n          In point of error twenty-four, Appellant names “Peter Kessels” as the venire member at\nissue. In the record, Kessels’s first name appears as “Pieter.”\n       15\n       In point of error twenty-eight, Appellant names “Diane Taylor” as the juror against\nwhom he raised a challenge for cause. We understand him to refer to venire member Diana Tyler.\n\f                                                                                         Cade–59\n\nfourteen of them to remove Lumpkins, Koshy, Newton, Askins, Hernandez, Morgan,\n\nKessels, Hilburn, Sturgeon, Johnlouis, Tyler, Langdon, Sowden, and Evans after the trial\n\ncourt denied his cause-based challenges to them.16 After Evans’s dismissal, Appellant\n\nreceived and used two additional peremptory strikes to remove Matthews and O’Con after\n\nunsuccessfully challenging them for cause. The trial court denied Appellant’s challenge\n\nfor cause to Adair, as well as Appellant’s request for a third additional strike. Appellant\n\nasserted that, as a result of the trial court’s refusal to grant an eighteenth peremptory strike,\n\nhe had been forced to accept an objectionable juror, Adair.17 Because Appellant received\n\ntwo additional peremptory strikes, he can only demonstrate harm by showing that the trial\n\ncourt erroneously denied at least three of his challenges for cause. Comeaux v. State, 445\n\nS.W.3d 745, 749 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014); Chambers v. State, 866 S.W.2d 9, 22–23 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1993).\n\n       A defendant may challenge a venire member for cause if the member is biased or\n\nprejudiced against the defendant or the law on which the State or defendant is entitled to\n\nrely. Gardner v. State, 306 S.W.3d 274, 295 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); see Art. 35.16(a)(9),\n\n(c)(2). A trial court must excuse the prospective juror if bias or prejudice would\n\nsubstantially impair the juror’s ability to carry out his oath and instructions in accordance\n\nwith the law. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. But before the judge excuses a potential juror\n\n\n       16\n        Appellant exercised his eighth peremptory strike against venire member Can Icduygu.\nAppellant did not challenge Icduygu for cause.\n       17\n            The record shows that Adair became the twelfth member of Appellant’s petit jury.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–60\n\nfor cause, the law must be explained to the juror. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 295. The\n\nproponent of the challenge for cause bears the burden of establishing that the challenge is\n\nproper. Id. The proponent does not meet this burden until he has shown that the venire\n\nmember understood the requirements of the law and could not overcome his prejudice well\n\nenough to follow the law. Id.\n\n       When reviewing a trial court’s decision to deny a challenge for cause, we look to\n\nthe entire record to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support the court’s\n\nruling and reverse only for a clear abuse of discretion. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Because\n\nthe trial judge is in the best position to evaluate a potential juror’s demeanor and\n\nresponses, we review a trial court’s ruling on a challenge for cause with considerable\n\ndeference. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 295; see Burks v. State, 876 S.W.2d 877, 893 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1994) (stating that the trial judge is in the best position to determine whether a\n\npotential juror will set aside his views and honestly and truthfully follow the juror’s oath).\n\nWhen a prospective juror’s answers concerning his ability to follow the law are\n\nvacillating, equivocating, ambiguous, unclear, or contradictory, we accord particular\n\ndeference to the trial court’s decision. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 295; Moore v. State, 999\n\nS.W.2d 385, 400, 407 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\n\n                                         A. Lumpkins\n\n       When defense counsel asked Lumpkins to explain his feelings about the insanity\n\ndefense, he answered: “I think -- I think it would have to be very strong, compelling\n\f                                                                                    Cade–61\n\nevidence, but it’s not something I reject out of hand.” Defense counsel argued that this\n\nstatement showed that Lumpkins would require Appellant to prove insanity by a\n\ncompelling-evidence standard, rather than a preponderance. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE\n\n§ 8.01(a).\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s challenge for\n\ncause on this basis. Lumpkins’s statement did not necessarily indicate that he would\n\nrequire Appellant to prove insanity by more than a preponderance standard. Further, the\n\nremainder of the exchange between Lumpkins and defense counsel suggested that\n\nLumpkins did not see “compelling” evidence as something that was inconsistent with a\n\npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard. After Lumpkins used the phrase “compelling\n\nevidence” and stated that he would not automatically reject an insanity defense, defense\n\ncounsel continued to question him as follows:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Yes. We just can’t -- We can’t be flippant about it. As you’ve\n       indicated in your answers before, I assume you mean that, you know, you\n       want something of substance.\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: Yeah, it can’t be because that’s the only recourse.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Right. Okay. And I think society, especially as recognized in\n       this state and other states, as a society, we don’t want to punish people who\n       do not know, because of some mental disease or defect, that they don’t\n       know the difference between right and wrong. Is that a fair statement?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: Uh-huh.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. And in that same vein, can you see that there are some\n       circumstances in which people actually physically go through acts that\n       cause people to die, or cause things to happen that are criminal offenses,\n\f                                                                                    Cade–62\n\n       and that they don’t know what they are doing because of some mental\n       disease or defect?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: I agree it’s possible.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: It’s possible. Okay. And that we have to sometimes look at all\n       the circumstances surrounding an event and possibly rely on other people\n       who study, make a profession of studying the mind; is that a fair statement?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: It’s why I said it’s compelling.\n\n       In addition, during earlier questioning by the State, Lumpkins evinced his\n\nunderstanding of Appellant’s burden of proof regarding the insanity defense and\n\nunequivocally stated that he would apply it if selected to serve. After informing Lumpkins\n\nthat Appellant might assert an insanity defense, the prosecutor discussed the concept of\n\nlegal insanity and explained Appellant’s preponderance burden of proof. The prosecutor\n\nthen probed Lumpkins’s ability to follow the law, if Appellant raised an insanity defense:\n\n       [PROSECUTION]: [I]f [insanity] were the defense, could you really use\n       your best judgment in determining whether or not the insanity is bona fide\n       or bunk?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: Well, that would depend on the preponderance of the\n       evidence to support it.\n\n       [PROSECUTION]: Sure.\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: In that event, yes.\n\nAfter discussing other topics related to the insanity determination, the prosecutor returned\n\nto Appellant’s preponderance burden of proof:\n\n       [PROSECUTION]: If you find the defendant not guilty, he goes home.\n       Okay? And when I talked to you earlier about insanity, the way insanity\n\f                                                                                      Cade–63\n\n       works is that, if you do believe [by] a preponderance of the evidence [that]\n       the defendant did not know that what he was doing was wrong at the time\n       of the commission of the offense, you have to find him not guilty by reason\n       of insanity. That’s what your oath is going to require you to do. If you\n       believe that, will you do it?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: Yes.\n\n       Lumpkins’s entire voir dire contains sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s\n\nruling. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Thus, Appellant has not demonstrated that the trial court\n\nerred in overruling his challenge for cause to Lumpkins. Point of error eighteen is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                           B. Askins\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Askins would require a higher burden of proof than the\n\nlaw required on the issue of insanity. The record of his individual voir dire shows that\n\nAskins vacillated about his ability to apply the preponderance standard, should Appellant\n\nhave raised an insanity defense.\n\n       When questioned by the State, Askins asserted that he could find Appellant not\n\nguilty by reason of insanity if Appellant raised that defense at trial and proved it by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. When defense counsel asked Askins whether he had any\n\nproblems with the idea of an insanity defense, the venire member retreated from his\n\noriginal position:\n\n       [ASKINS]: You know, it’s hard for me to consider. I mean obviously there\n       are always circumstances that can bring that into play. But, honestly, it is\n       hard for me to consider the insanity defense, so I mean.\n\f                                                                                   Cade–64\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Would you, since our burden of proof is not to the level of\n       beyond a reasonable doubt on insanity, it’s by a preponderance which is just\n       kind of like more likely than not, like a -- If you’re using percentages, it\n       would be like 50.001 percent that we have to get to. Would you require the\n       defense to have a higher burden of proof in the insanity issue because it\n       would be so hard for you to consider?\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yeah.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: You would?\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yeah, I would.\n\nDefense counsel then requested a recess and challenged Askins for cause. The trial court\n\ndenied the challenge and after recalling Askins to the stand, addressed him directly:\n\n       [COURT]: Mr. Askins, the burden on the defense on the issue of insanity,\n       it’s their burden, it’s by a preponderance of the evidence. The legal\n       definition of preponderance of the evidence is the greater weight of the\n       credible and believable evidence. That’s their burden.\n\n       [ASKINS]: Okay.\n\n       [COURT]: Can you accept that burden?\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yes.\n\n       [COURT]: Okay. Would you apply that burden --\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yes.\n\n       [COURT]: -- in answering the issue on insanity?\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yes.\n\nAfter the trial court asked Askins to step outside, defense counsel renewed the challenge.\n\nThe trial court again denied it.\n\f                                                                                    Cade–65\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion. To the extent Askins vacillated about his\n\nability to apply a preponderance standard to Appellant’s insanity defense, the trial judge\n\nwas in the best position to determine whether the venire member would set aside his views\n\nand honestly and truthfully follow the juror’s oath. Burks, 876 S.W.2d at 893. In his final\n\nstatement on the issue, Askins asserted that he could, and would, follow the law. The trial\n\njudge was entitled to believe him, and we defer to that belief. See Gonzales v. State, 353\n\nS.W.3d 826, 836 n.7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). Point of error twenty-one is overruled.\n\n                                       C. Hernandez\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Hernandez could not follow the law regarding the\n\ninsanity defense and would elevate the defense’s burden of proof. The record shows that,\n\nunder questioning by the State, Hernandez unequivocally stated that she could and would\n\napply the preponderance standard if Appellant raised an insanity defense and would acquit\n\nhim if he satisfied that standard. When questioned by defense counsel, Hernandez again\n\nagreed that Appellant’s burden of proof regarding the insanity issue was a preponderance\n\nstandard. However, in response to a follow-up question, Hernandez manifested some\n\nconfusion about the possible evidentiary burdens and the differences between them:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Well, let me ask it to you this way. Is [preponderance] going\n       to be the same burden as like clear and convincing evidence or by proof\n       beyond a reasonable doubt to you?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: Beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Well, you shook your head and you said proof beyond a\n       reasonable doubt, so I didn’t understand what that meant to you.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–66\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: It’s beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. So you’re saying that a preponderance of the evidence\n       is going to have to be proven to you beyond a reasonable doubt?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: Yes.\n\n       Defense counsel clarified that preponderance of the evidence was an evidentiary\n\nstandard of its own and explained where it stood in relation to the clear-and-convincing\n\nand reasonable-doubt evidentiary burdens. After stating that the law required Appellant to\n\nprove insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, counsel returned to his original\n\nquestion:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: [O]kay, would you be able to hold us to that burden, or do you\n       think it’s going to take more like clear and convincing evidence or proof\n       beyond a reasonable doubt?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: I could hold you to that burden.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: You could -- I’m sorry?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: I could do that by a preponderance.\n\n       Defense counsel then asked Hernandez for her thoughts on psychiatrists and\n\npsychologists. When Hernandez responded, “There needs to be more like evidence from\n\ndifferent doctors,” this exchange followed:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. So if we were to bring you one doctor and you believed\n       him, by a preponderance of the evidence, that our client was insane at the\n       time of the offense, is that going to be sufficient for you, or are you going to\n       need more than that?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: I think I’ll need more than that.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–67\n\n      [DEFENSE]: So you’re going to -- And this is where we have to use the\n      terms biased and prejudiced.\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: That’s fine.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: To some degree, you’re going to have a bias against the\n      defense because you’re going to require, even if you believe that one doctor\n      by a preponderance of the evidence, you’re going to require more than that;\n      is that correct?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Yes, just to be on the safe side.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: And that was a yes; is that correct?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Yes, sir.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Okay. And as I’ve explained to you, you know, I’ve told you\n      in that situation you believe that expert, okay, and you believe him and you\n      believe that we’ve proven our case by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n             But what you’re telling me is, even though you believe that, and you\n      believe it by a preponderance of the evidence, you’re going to require more,\n      correct?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: He needs to gain my -- I need to be able to, you know, I\n      need to be able to trust him. You know, I need to see like what kind of\n      history that doctor has and all that.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Okay. Well, I’m telling you, okay, I’m telling you right now\n      that you believe him. Okay? And you believe him --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: So you’re telling me that I believe him.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Yeah, and I’m saying --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: would say I believe him.\n\n      Evidently uncertain whether Hernandez understood the hypothetical or dissatisfied\n\nwith her answer, defense counsel re-emphasized the assumptions he was asking Hernandez\n\f                                                                                     Cade–68\n\nto make, then continued,\n\n      [DEFENSE]: And you’ve indicated to me that, in that situation, you’re\n      going to require more than one doctor. Is that still --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Yes. If it’s possible, yes. But I mean if he already gained\n      my trust and has more -- the balance is more on this side, like it’s better.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Let me just -- The trust and everything, that’s something\n      that’s personal to you. Okay.\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Okay.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: All I can tell you is what the law says. And I’m now trying to\n      put you in a situation where, under the law, we’ve proven to you by a\n      preponderance of the evidence --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Yes.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: -- that he has proven that he was insane by the preponderance\n      of the evidence. Just that burden, okay?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Okay.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: And what you have indicated to me is that, given that\n      situation, you would have a bias against --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Well, if it’s by law, then I need to follow the law.\n\n      After observing that it was everyone’s natural tendency to say that she could follow\n\nthe law, counsel posed the hypothetical to Hernandez again and asked what her verdict\n\nwould be. Hernandez responded that, “I always go with whatever the law says.” Counsel\n\ncontinued to press Hernandez:\n\n      [DEFENSE]: So you understand what I’m getting at here, okay?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Uh-huh.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–69\n\n       [DEFENSE]: I’m telling you that we’ve proven to you by the\n       preponderance of the evidence --\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: You’ve already proven it to me.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And I want to know, what would your verdict be in that\n       situation?\n\nWhen the prosecutor objected that the question had already been asked and answered, the\n\ntrial court stated, “He can ask it again. He can ask it for three more minutes. I’ve heard --\n\nI’ve heard what she said.” When defense counsel asked Hernandez for her answer, she\n\nstated, “If it’s already been proven, then yes, I’ll go with that.” Defense counsel concluded\n\nhis voir dire and immediately afterward challenged her for cause. The trial court denied the\n\nchallenge.\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion. Hernandez repeatedly stated that she\n\nwould hold Appellant to a preponderance standard regarding his insanity defense. To the\n\nextent that Hernandez’s answers sometimes suggested she would hold Appellant to a\n\nhigher burden, the record supports a finding that those responses were based on her\n\ntemporary misapprehension of the law or confusion over defense counsel’s hypotheticals.\n\nFurther, the trial judge was in the best position to evaluate Hernandez’s demeanor and\n\nresponses. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. We extend particular deference to the trial\n\njudge’s decision in these circumstances. See id. Point of error twenty-two is overruled.\n\n                         D. Morgan, Hilburn, Langdon, and O’Con\n\n       Defense counsel challenged Morgan, Hilburn, Langdon, and O’Con solely due to\n\f                                                                                         Cade–70\n\ncertain written responses they gave on the juror questionnaire, arguing that the answers\n\nshowed that these veniremembers would automatically vote for the death penalty. The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in overruling Appellant’s challenges for cause to these\n\nfour prospective jurors.\n\n       While a juror who would automatically vote for the death penalty can be\n\nchallengeable for cause once a proper basis is established, Appellant failed to establish the\n\nproper bases to challenge these veniremembers for cause. To establish those bases,\n\nAppellant had to show that “the veniremember[s] understood the requirements of the law\n\nand could not overcome [their] prejudice well enough to follow the law.” Gardner, 306\n\nS.W.3d at 295. The requirements of the law are explained during voir dire 18 and after the\n\nquestionnaire or juror card is answered.19 As a result, a veniremember cannot be\n\nsufficiently questioned regarding possible prejudice revealed in the questionnaire or during\n\nvoir dire without, at least, some minimum amount of interaction on the part of the\n\nveniremember during voir dire.\n\n\n\n\n       18\n          See, e.g., Cardenas v. State, 325 S.W.3d 179, 185–86 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (stating\nthat the trial judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney explained the requirements of the law\napplicable to the case to the venire panel during voir dire); Barnard v. State, 730 S.W.2d 703,\n715 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987) (holding that the trial judge did not err by conducting a general voir\ndire before individual voir dire in a capital case because the defendant was allowed to\nindividually voir dire veniremembers regarding the law of capital murder); Martinez v. State, 867\nS.W.2d 30, 35 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (same).\n       19\n          See, e.g., Garza v. State, 7 S.W.3d 164, 166 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (noting that written\nquestionnaires are not a formal part of voir dire proceedings and, in some cases, questionnaires or\njuror information cards can be submitted “long in advance of voir dire”).\n\f                                                                                    Cade–71\n\n       Therefore, because Appellant solely relied on their questionnaire answers in\n\nchallenging Morgan, Hilburn, Langdon, and O’Con for cause, he could not have\n\nestablished proper bases for challenging these veniremembers, and it was within the trial\n\ncourt’s discretion to determine that Appellant did not satisfy his burden to show that the\n\nchallenges were proper. See Garza, 7 S.W.3d 164, 166 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). Points of\n\nerror twenty-three, twenty-five, twenty-nine, and thirty-three are overruled.\n\n                                         E. Kessels\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Kessels would automatically impose the death penalty\n\nif Appellant were convicted of capital murder. At trial, counsel alluded to a portion of\n\nKessels’s voir dire testimony, in which counsel paraphrased Kessels as “say[ing]\n\nsomething about that he would start out at a death penalty and that it would take a lot of\n\nthinking for him to get back to neutral.” The trial court denied Appellant’s challenge.\n\n       In support of his argument, Appellant directs us to a portion of Kessels’s voir dire\n\nby the State. The prosecutor had begun to discuss the future-dangerousness special issue.\n\nHe had explained that it was permissible for a juror to answer the future dangerousness\n\nissue “yes” based on the circumstances of the offense, if the juror believed that the\n\ncircumstances so warranted. However, the prosecutor had also emphasized that the juror’s\n\nanswer to the future dangerousness issue could not be automatic. Although Kessels\n\nanswered “yes” when the prosecutor asked whether he could follow the process, the\n\nprosecutor noted hesitation in Kessels’s response. Noting the unfamiliarity of the special\n\f                                                                                     Cade–72\nissues to most jurors, the prosecutor asked Kessels to explain. Kessels responded:\n\n       [KESSELS]: When you said that I have to not really be able to answer\n       question -- Special Issue 1 until you’ve had the burden of proving it.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay.\n\n       [KESSELS]: I really just have a general belief that if someone commits,\n       what you’re saying, a multiple murder, a multiple stabbing murder, that\n       there inherently may be something in them that’s going to make me answer\n       that yes.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay.\n\n       [KESSELS]: So that might be something that I would have to work on to\n       get a more neutral playing field before that started.\n\nAppellant based his challenge on these statements.\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s challenge for\n\ncause to Kessels. The record shows that Kessels made the complained-of statements\n\nbefore the law was fully explained to him. Following Kessels’s statements, the prosecutor\n\nagain noted jurors’ general unfamiliarity with capital-sentencing procedures and explained\n\nthe second special issue. The prosecutor then presented a hypothetical to help Kessels\n\nunderstand the special issues’ interaction and why jurors should not automatically answer\n\nthem a certain way, even when a capital-murder conviction involved multiple murders.\n\nThe prosecutor began by describing the bare facts of a hypothetical capital murder\n\ninvolving two victims—facts from which, without additional information, a jury might\n\nreasonably draw negative inferences concerning the special issues (i.e., that the death\n\npenalty should be assessed).\n\f                                                                                     Cade–73\n       But the prosecutor then gave Kessels various examples of evidence that might be\n\npresented only at the punishment phase and that might lead jurors to answer the special\n\nissues in a way that would result in a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\nAfterward, the prosecutor questioned Kessels as follows:\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: And can you see how not having heard all the evidence\n       [yet], the answer has to start out no on Special Issue 1 until we prove it\n       otherwise and until you’ve kept an open mind and heard all the evidence?\n\n              Does that make sense?\n\n       [KESSELS]: It does.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Does that clear up your hesitation?\n\n       [KESSELS]: Yes. Great explanation.\n\nKessels subsequently asserted that the procedure and rationale surrounding the special\n\nissues made sense to him, and that he had no hesitation about being able to participate in\n\nthe process and keep an open mind until he heard all the evidence.\n\n       The record contains sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s ruling. Davis,\n\n329 S.W.3d at 807. Point of error twenty-four is overruled.\n\n                                         F. Sturgeon\n\n       Appellant asserts that Sturgeon was challengeable for cause because he exhibited a\n\nlack of candor in his written response to a questionnaire item concerning prior jury service.\n\nAppellant relies on Franklin v. State, 138 S.W.3d 351, 354–55 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004),\n\nasserting that when a potential juror withholds material information, it suggests bias.\n\f                                                                                    Cade–74\n       Question 45 of the juror questionnaire asked veniremembers whether they, or their\n\nspouses, had ever been jurors in a civil or criminal case. If the venire member checked\n\n“yes,” the question directed the individual to provide the year and type of case, verdict,\n\npunishment amount, and whether the judge or the jury set punishment. Sturgeon checked\n\n“yes.” He wrote that, while he could not recall the year, he had been a juror in a criminal\n\ncase in which the jury had acquitted the defendant.\n\n       During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor asked Sturgeon about his jury service in\n\nthe case Sturgeon had listed in response to Question 45. Sturgeon described it as a\n\npedophilia case and stated that the trial lasted three or four days. When the prosecutor\n\nasked whether that was his first time serving on a jury, Sturgeon answered, “Something\n\nlike that. I mean, I served on a traffic violation jury in Garland.” Sturgeon subsequently\n\ntold the prosecutor that his service on the traffic violation case occurred “way before” his\n\nservice on the pedophilia case. When the defense questioned him, Sturgeon guessed that\n\nhe might have served on the pedophilia case in the late 1990s.\n\n       In challenging him for cause, defense counsel acknowledged that Sturgeon had\n\nlisted his jury service in the pedophilia case on the questionnaire, but noted that Sturgeon\n\nhad not included his service in the traffic case. Counsel argued that Sturgeon’s failure to\n\nlist his traffic-case service on the questionnaire reflected a lack of candor and suggested\n\nthat he would automatically vote for the death penalty.\n\n       Appellant’s reliance on Franklin is misplaced. Franklin concerned the standard of\n\f                                                                                       Cade–75\nharm an appellate court should apply when a trial judge erroneously denies a mistrial that\n\nthe defendant sought on the grounds that a juror withheld material information during voir\n\ndire. Id. at 355. In that context, we noted our previous holding that, “where a juror\n\nwithholds material information during the voir dire process,” the Sixth Amendment is\n\nimplicated because “the parties are denied the opportunity to exercise their challenges,\n\nthus hampering their selection of a disinterested and impartial jury.” Id. at 354 (citing\n\nSalazar v. State, 562 S.W.2d 480, 482 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1978)).\n\n       Sturgeon did not withhold the information about his traffic-case jury service. In\n\nfact, Sturgeon volunteered the information during his individual voir dire. Both parties had\n\nan opportunity to question Sturgeon on the matter and make informed choices concerning\n\nthe exercise of their challenges. In addition, it was within the trial judge’s discretion to\n\ndetermine that the information was immaterial. See Franklin v. State, 12 S.W.3d 473,\n\n477–79 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n       The record contains sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s ruling. The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s challenge for cause to Sturgeon\n\nbased on his alleged lack of candor on the juror questionnaire. Point of error twenty-six is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                         G. Johnlouis\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Johnlouis’s response to his hypothetical showed that\n\nshe would automatically assess the death penalty. Counsel also asserted that Johnlouis\n\f                                                                                      Cade–76\nwould elevate Appellant’s burden of proof regarding the insanity determination because\n\nshe would require him to present an expert in support of an insanity defense. We find no\n\nabuse of discretion because the record of Johnlouis’s voir dire supports the trial court’s\n\nruling.\n\n          During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor explained that Texas law provides two\n\nsentencing options for capital murder: (1) life without parole or (2) death. Johnlouis agreed\n\nthat she believed the death penalty was appropriate “in certain circumstances” but was\n\nopen to both sentencing options. After exploring topics primarily relevant to the guilt-\n\ninnocence determination, the prosecutor returned to the subject of punishment and\n\nJohnlouis’s ability to answer the special issues based on the law and evidence, even if it\n\nmeant that a death sentence would result. Johnlouis stated that she would be comfortable\n\nparticipating in a process that could result in a defendant receiving a death sentence, but\n\nJohnlouis repeatedly emphasized that her answers to the special issues would depend on\n\nthe evidence. Johnlouis also asserted that her answers to the special issues would not be\n\ndictated by the fact that the jury had found Appellant guilty of capital murder.\n\n          During Appellant’s voir dire, defense counsel presented Johnlouis with a\n\nhypothetical, asking her to assume that she sat on a jury that had just found a defendant\n\nguilty of capital murder. Counsel emphasized that by finding the defendant guilty, the jury\n\nhad necessarily determined that the defendant had “[k]nowingly and intentionally caused\n\nthe death of two people. All right. Meant to do it, intended to do it. It wasn’t a mistake. It\n\f                                                                                      Cade–77\nwasn’t an accident. The person wasn’t insane, okay?” Following that introduction, defense\n\ncounsel asked Johnlouis to tell him “what [her] thoughts are on the death penalty at that\n\npoint.” Johnlouis responded, “Again, I have to hear --” before being cut off by the\n\nprosecutor, who objected that defense counsel had asked an improper commitment\n\nquestion. After the court overruled the objection and defense counsel asked for Johnlouis’s\n\nanswer, she asked him to “[g]ive [her] the question . . . again. There’s so much going on.”\n\nCounsel repeated the hypothetical, again emphasizing what the jury had necessarily\n\ndetermined by finding the defendant guilty and asking for Johnlouis’s “thoughts . . . on the\n\ndeath penalty at that point.” Johnlouis answered, “The death penalty because he did it, you\n\nknow, and there was no -- he did it.”\n\n       Apparently believing that Johnlouis did not understand the issue or his question,\n\ndefense counsel explained the differences in the jury’s inquiry at the guilt-innocence phase\n\nversus the punishment phase of trial, focusing on the special issues. He then presented the\n\nhypothetical again:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And what were your thoughts on the death penalty at that\n       point?\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: And Special [Issue] Number 1 has been --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: No, I’m just saying -- that’s what I’m saying, you’re just at\n       the guilt/innocence portion, okay?\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: I’m just at the guilt/innocence?\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Yeah, you found the person guilty of capital murder.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–78\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Guilty? Okay.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Okay. So what would your thoughts be on the death penalty at\n      that point?\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Again, if they -- if he’s guilty or she’s guilty, then if\n      they’re imposing the death penalty, then they’ll impose the death penalty, I\n      guess.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: So your belief is that at that phase of the trial the person ought\n      to get the death penalty, is that your position?\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nDefense counsel then abandoned his hypothetical and proceeded to discuss Special Issue\n\nNumber 1:\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Okay. And so when you’re going through that special issue,\n      would you agree with me that you would have to be convinced beyond a\n      reasonable doubt that this defendant would commit criminal acts of\n      violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society, correct?\n\n             Would you agree with me on that?\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Again, I need to hear, you know, more than just he’s -- you\n      know, what he did. I mean what happened, you know, the circumstances of\n      what happened.\n\nJohnlouis continued:\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: I don’t think I would say that he would be a threat until I\n      can understand or hear, you know, some of the things that’s happening that\n      he did or whatever. I -- I can’t make that decision at this point.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: And I’m not asking you to make the decision. What I’m trying\n      to --\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Would he be a threat? Until I get the evidence, I’m not\n      sure, you know. I have to weigh what’s going on with him, you know. I\n\f                                                                                     Cade–79\n       don’t -- and then try to put that into perspective. I’m not sure if he would be\n       a threat to society. I don’t, you know --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And that’s what I’m getting at.\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: Yeah.\n\n       The record supports a finding that Johnlouis was confused by counsel’s\n\nhypothetical, which asked for her “thoughts” on the death penalty rather than whether she\n\ncould follow the law, and that her answers resulted from that confusion. Johnlouis’s\n\nsubsequent statements regarding Special Issue Number 1, and her testimony during the\n\nState’s voir dire, manifested her understanding that, by law, a death sentence cannot be the\n\nautomatic consequence of a capital-murder conviction. They similarly manifested her\n\nwillingness to follow the law. In any event, the trial judge was in the best position to\n\ndetermine whether Johnlouis would set aside her personal views and honestly and\n\ntruthfully follow the juror’s oath. Burks, 876 S.W.2d at 893. We defer to his\n\ndetermination.\n\n       We next consider Appellant’s assertion that Johnlouis would elevate his burden of\n\nproof by requiring him to present an expert witness to support his insanity defense. When\n\ndefense counsel initially began discussing the insanity defense and the applicable burden\n\nof proof, he explained that the law did not require Appellant to present expert testimony,\n\nand that Appellant could prove his defense solely with lay testimony. Johnlouis stated that\n\nshe could find Appellant not guilty by reason of insanity based on the testimony of one\n\npsychologist, if she believed the testimony and it established legal insanity by a\n\f                                                                                   Cade–80\npreponderance of the evidence. Johnlouis also stated that she could find Appellant not\n\nguilty by reason of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, based on a lay witness’s\n\ntestimony and without expert testimony. But when defense counsel began to transition to\n\nanother topic, Johnlouis asked for clarification regarding the means by which Appellant\n\ncould prove legal insanity. Defense counsel explained again that Appellant could prove his\n\ndefense only with lay testimony, if he wished. Afterward, Johnlouis stated that she\n\nunderstood and had no problem with a lack of expert testimony.\n\n       Defense counsel later asked Johnlouis if she had any questions. Johnlouis expressed\n\nsome difficulty with the idea of Appellant proving insanity solely through lay testimony: “I\n\ndon’t quite agree -- I mean, understand, maybe. I don’t agree with the non-expert delivery.\n\nThat’s a problem with me, yeah.” She continued,\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: You know, I -- personally, I feel that you have to have\n       somebody -- I mean, a cousin or somebody --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay.\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: -- saying that they’re insane or whatever.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: So you’re saying that you would need an expert there?\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: I think I would probably want one, you know, just to, you\n       know, and run tests or whatever on the --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And -- and --\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: Yeah, because, you know, you can’t just have me --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And that’s –\n\f                                                                                        Cade–81\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: -- come up and say I’m crazy when I’m not.\n\nDefense counsel explained the law again and referred to Johnlouis’s earlier assertion that\n\nshe could find Appellant not guilty by reason of insanity if he proved it by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence through a lay witness. Counsel told Johnlouis that if her\n\nanswer had changed, then she needed to tell him. Johnlouis responded, “[I]f that’s what\n\nthe law says, then we have to follow the law, you know, so that’s why I said I could do it.\n\nBut just because the law -- not that I agree with it, but because of the law.” When counsel\n\ncontinued to press her on the point, Johnlouis stated, “Well, I -- I just said -- I don’t -- I\n\npersonally don’t agree with that but, you know, if that’s the law, that’s the law, you\n\nknow.” In further discussion, Johnlouis was emphatic about her ability to set aside her\n\npersonal disagreement and follow the law, now that she understood it.\n\n       To the extent that Johnlouis gave inconsistent or unclear statements, the trial court\n\nwas in the best position to determine whether she would set aside her personal views and\n\nhonestly and truthfully follow the juror’s oath. Id. We defer to its determination. Point of\n\nerror twenty-seven is overruled.\n\n                                            H. Tyler\n\n       Appellant argues that Tyler was challengeable because (1) she would require an\n\nexpert to testify in support of an insanity defense, and (2) she would impose a higher\n\nburden of proof than the law required regarding the insanity determination. The trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in overruling Appellant’s challenge for cause on these bases.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–82\n       During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor informed Tyler that Appellant might\n\nraise an insanity defense at trial. The prosecutor explained the definition of legal insanity,\n\nAppellant’s preponderance burden of proof, and that Appellant need not present expert\n\ntestimony or a certain number of witnesses. Tyler unequivocally stated that she could\n\nfollow the law in deciding whether Appellant was not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\n       The exchange that formed the basis of Appellant’s challenge to Tyler came at the\n\nend of the defense’s voir dire when defense counsel directed Tyler’s attention to Question\n\n38 of the juror questionnaire. Question 38 informed potential jurors that a person with\n\nmental illness can receive life without parole or the death penalty for capital murder and\n\nasked veniremembers what they thought. Tyler had written, “I don’t know about that[,]\n\nsometime[s] I think they [know] what they are doing.” When defense counsel asked Tyler\n\nwhat she meant by her answer, she explained,\n\n       [TYLER]: Sometimes people are mentally ill but they -- sometimes they be\n       in their right mind and I think sometimes they know what they be doing,\n       and then sometimes if they’re not on their medication, they don’t know.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Well, would you -- you’re -- I think that -- that -- let me ask\n       you, would you be able to listen to evidence about the insanity defense and\n       if you believed that [Appellant] . . . was insane at the time of the offense,\n       would you be able to say not guilty by reason of insanity?\n\n       [TYLER]: If you prove it to me.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: What kind of -- of proof would you be looking for in a -- in\n       an insanity defense, do you know?\n\n              Do you have any idea about that?\n\f                                                                                    Cade–83\n       [TYLER]: I think that you would have to have an expert witness to testify\n       or something to say that he’s insane, something showing that he wasn’t on\n       his medication at the time or if he’s on medication.\n\n              I mean, you have to prove to me that he was insane.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Would we have to prove that to you more than as it was\n       explained to you, more than [by] a preponderance of the evidence?\n\n       [TYLER]: I think so.\n\n       Defense counsel concluded his voir dire directly thereafter and challenged Tyler\n\nfor cause based on the exchange set forth immediately above. After hearing the parties’\n\narguments for and against the challenge, the trial court recalled Tyler to the stand and\n\nquestioned her directly:\n\n       [COURT]: [Y]ou understand that the law requires that they prove [insanity]\n       by a preponderance of the evidence, --\n\n       [TYLER]: Yes, right.\n\n       [COURT]: -- okay?\n\n              And you understand that’s the law.\n\n       [TYLER]: Right.\n\n       [COURT]: Now preponderance of the evidence is not as great a burden as\n       beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n              You understand that?\n\n       [TYLER]:      (Nods head.)\n\n       [COURT]: In fact, one of the attorneys said, you know, 50.1 percent to 49.9\n       percent, or whatever you want to -- just barely tipping the scale one way or\n       another.\n\f                                                                                    Cade–84\n       [TYLER]: Right.\n\n       [COURT]: That’s the burden of proof that the defense has to prove to\n       you . . . [that] the defendant’s insane -- [was] insane at the time of the\n       offense.\n\n             And when [the prosecutor] was talking to you, you said [y]es, you\n       understood that and you could.\n\n              And I think you gave [defense counsel] a different answer, in that\n       you said, well, you would require more of a burden of proof from the\n       defense than a preponderance of the evidence. I mean, [those weren’t] your\n       exact words, but that’s what you indicated.\n\n              Is that the way you feel?\n\n              Now that you know what the law is, can you follow the law or would\n       you require them [to meet] a higher burden of proof than the law imposes?\n\n       [TYLER]: No, I could follow the law. If he proved that to a certain degree\n       that --\n\n       [COURT]: By a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n       [TYLER]: Right. That he was insane at the time?\n\n       [COURT]: Yeah.\n\n       [TYLER]: I could go along with that.\n\n       [COURT]: Okay.\n\n       [TYLER]: I could follow the law.\n\nThe trial court thereafter denied the challenge for cause.\n\n       We find no abuse of discretion. To the extent Tyler gave contradictory answers\n\nconcerning her ability to apply a preponderance standard to Appellant’s insanity defense\n\f                                                                                       Cade–85\nand whether she would require Appellant to present expert testimony, the trial judge was\n\nin the best position to determine whether she would set aside her views and honestly and\n\ntruthfully follow the juror’s oath. Burks, 876 S.W.2d at 893. The trial judge was entitled\n\nto believe Tyler when she told him that she could and would follow the law; we defer to\n\nthat belief. See Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 836 n.7. Point of error twenty-eight is overruled.\n\n                                          I. Sowden\n\n       Appellant challenged Sowden on the grounds that she would automatically vote for\n\nthe death penalty and hold the defense to a higher burden of proof than the law required\n\non the issue of insanity. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Appellant’s\n\nchallenge to Sowden on these grounds.\n\n       Regarding the allegation that Sowden would automatically assess the death\n\npenalty, Appellant relies on a response she gave during the State’s voir dire. He asserts\n\nthat Sowden stated she would be “inclined” to assess the death penalty if a person were\n\nfound guilty of a capital murder involving the killings of two people. See T EX. P ENAL\n\nC ODE § 19.03(a)(7). Appellant acknowledges that Sowden went on to say that she would\n\nlisten to all the evidence, but he contends that her initial response reflected her true\n\nfeelings. We find no abuse of discretion, as the record supports the trial court’s ruling.\n\n       Before Sowden made the statement at issue, the prosecutor had begun to explain\n\nthe law concerning capital murder. Sowden stated that she had previously assumed that a\n\ncapital-murder conviction automatically meant a death sentence. After learning more\n\f                                                                                        Cade–86\nabout capital-sentencing procedures, however, Sowden denied believing that everyone\n\nconvicted of capital murder should automatically receive the death penalty, no matter\n\nwhat the punishment-phase evidence might show.\n\n       The prosecutor then asked Sowden to assume that she sat on a jury that had found\n\na defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of a capital murder involving the deaths of\n\ntwo people. The prosecutor emphasized that the jury had, therefore, necessarily found that\n\nthe killings were not accidental, but intentional. He asked Sowden, “And are you\n\nautomatically going to assess the death penalty or will you listen to the next phase of trial\n\nand honestly apply those questions and see where the answer takes you?” Sowden replied,\n\n“I might have some idea, but I will listen to the facts,” and, “That’s what will lead me.”\n\n       Appellant relies on Sowden’s statement, that she “might have some idea,” to\n\nsupport his argument that she would automatically assess the death penalty. But the\n\nprosecutor continued to question Sowden on this subject and obtained several definitive\n\nanswers that she would not automatically assess a death sentence. Sowden expressed her\n\nbelief in the integrity of the sentencing process and her willingness to maintain it,\n\nasserting that she could “listen to everything and then . . . make [her] decision on what\n\n[she] listened to.” When defense counsel asked Sowden what she had meant when she\n\ntold the prosecutor that she had “some idea,” Sowden responded, “Some idea -- what\n\nyou’re talking to me about is I have no facts yet on this case, so that’s when I say, I have\n\nan idea what I would do, but I cannot tell you until I have all the facts exactly what I will\n\f                                                                                        Cade–87\ndo.” Sowden further explained, “If I have all the facts and I believe someone is guilty,\n\nthen I will go into it with those beliefs. I won’t have an idea at that point. I won’t -- it’s\n\nhard for me to say without knowing all the details.” She asserted again that her answers to\n\nthe special issues would not be automatic: “When I walk in there, I will not say, [t]his\n\nperson should die. I mean, it could be life. I mean, when I step into the second part of this\n\n-- after I hear everything, I can tell you.”\n\n       The entirety of Sowden’s voir dire shows that she made several unequivocal\n\nassertions that she would not automatically vote for a death sentence but would consider\n\nall the evidence and follow the law. To the extent any of her answers on that issue were\n\nunclear or ambiguous, the trial court was in the best position to evaluate her demeanor\n\nand responses. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. We defer to the trial court’s ruling.\n\n       We next turn to Appellant’s contention that Sowden would hold Appellant to a\n\nhigher burden of proof on the insanity determination. During the State’s voir dire, the\n\nprosecutor explained the concept of legal insanity and Appellant’s burden of proof.\n\nSowden stated that she could find Appellant not guilty by reason of insanity if he proved\n\ninsanity by a preponderance of the evidence. Sowden also stated that she could find\n\nAppellant not guilty by reason of insanity on the testimony of one or several witnesses, so\n\nlong as the testimony convinced her by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellant\n\nwas insane at the time of the offense.\n\n       During Appellant’s voir dire, defense counsel also asked Sowden whether, if the\n\f                                                                                     Cade–88\ndefense proved insanity by a preponderance of the evidence through one witness, she\n\nwould have a problem finding Appellant not guilty by reason of insanity. Sowden\n\nanswered that she “would factor it in, certainly.” After explaining the preponderance\n\nstandard again, counsel repeated the question. Sowden responded, “If I believe that\n\nperson is a credible witness. I mean, if that person speaks to me in a manner that I believe\n\nthat person, then yes, I will believe he’s insane.”\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Sowden’s use of the word “credible” and her\n\nintonation when saying it meant that she would elevate Appellant’s burden of proof.\n\nNoting that credibility was part of the preponderance standard’s definition, the trial judge\n\ndenied the challenge. We find no abuse of discretion, as we have defined preponderance\n\nof the evidence as the greater weight of credible evidence that would create a reasonable\n\nbelief in the truth of the claim. See Druery v. State, 412 S.W.3d 523, 540 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2013). Further, the trial judge was in the best position to evaluate Sowden’s\n\ndemeanor and responses. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Point of error thirty is overruled.\n\n                                           J. Evans\n\n       Defense counsel challenged Evans for cause on three grounds: (1) she would\n\nautomatically assess the death penalty, (2) she could not consider evidence about genetics\n\nin answering the mitigation special issue, and (3) she did not understand and could not\n\nfollow the law regarding Appellant’s preponderance burden on insanity. The trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s challenges for cause to Evans.\n\f                                                                                      Cade–89\n       Counsel based his first two reasons for challenging Evans on her juror\n\nquestionnaire answers. Counsel argued that, although Evans stated during voir dire that\n\nshe would change her questionnaire answers now that she had been educated about the\n\nlaw, her demeanor led him to believe that she still held the views expressed in her\n\nquestionnaire and could not follow the law. Appellant does not direct us to any instance\n\nfrom Evans’s voir dire in which she indicated that she understood the law, but she held\n\ncontrary personal views that she could not set aside, nor does our review reveal any. As to\n\nher demeanor during voir dire when questioned about these issues, the trial judge was in\n\nthe best position to evaluate it, and we defer to his determination. Id.\n\n       Regarding the challenge related to his burden of proof on the insanity\n\ndetermination, Appellant relies on an exchange that occurred during the defense’s voir\n\ndire. When the prosecutor initially defined legal insanity and explained Appellant’s\n\npreponderance burden of proof, Evans stated that she could find Appellant not guilty by\n\nreason of insanity if the defense proved insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, even\n\nif the evidence came through one witness. Evans also stated that she would not hold\n\nAppellant to a higher burden than the preponderance standard. Near the end of\n\nAppellant’s voir dire, defense counsel also defined legal insanity and explained\n\nAppellant’s burden of proof. Counsel then gave Evans a hypothetical in the following\n\nexchange:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. If whatever evidence was brought to you, even if it was\n       by one person, and the State did prove -- I mean the defense, excuse me, I\n\f                                                                                    Cade–90\n       misstated. -- the defense proved this defense of insanity by a preponderance\n       of the evidence, your verdict would be what?\n\n       [EVANS]: If the State did prove?\n\n       [DEFENSE]: No, I misstated.\n\n       [EVANS]: I mean if the defense did prove?\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Let’s start over, okay?\n\n       [EVANS]: Okay.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Because I think I screwed it up. I explained the burden of\n       proof. This table has the burden of proof on insanity.\n\n       [EVANS]: Okay.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: The burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence. If\n       we, by one witness or whatever the witness says, and you believe this\n       witness by a preponderance of the evidence and the defense has met that\n       burden in your mind, what would your verdict be or what would you vote\n       for?\n\n       [EVANS]: I guess the insanity one?\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Uh-huh. You could find somebody not guilty by reason of\n       insanity?\n\n       [EVANS]: Yes.\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Evans’s demeanor during the foregoing exchange was\n\n“very inquisitive,” as if she “wasn’t sure” and wanted someone to tell her how to respond.\n\nThe State countered that it had been clear that Evans was simply confused due to defense\n\ncounsel’s initial misstatement. The trial judge, who was in the best position to assess\n\nEvans’s demeanor and responses, denied the challenge. We defer to his decision. Id. Point\n\f                                                                                    Cade–91\nof error thirty-one is overruled.\n\n                                        K. Matthews\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Matthews “hesitated” during voir dire questioning,\n\nwhich indicated that she could not follow the law on insanity and would hold the defense\n\nto a higher burden than the law required. Appellant directs us to Matthews’s response\n\nwhen the prosecutor asked whether she could find Appellant not guilty by reason of\n\ninsanity based on the testimony of one witness. Although Matthews answered, “Yes,” the\n\nprosecutor indicated that he perceived some hesitation in her response. When he asked\n\nwhether the hesitation was because the decision would be distasteful, Matthews\n\nanswered, “No,” but stated that “it [would] take great pondering.” She continued, “It’s not\n\ngoing to be a quick decision, in other words.”\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the challenge for cause.\n\nMatthews’s reference to “pondering” and subsequent clarification did not unequivocally\n\nestablish an inability to follow the law. See Moore, 999 S.W.2d at 407. Moreover, when\n\nquestioned by the defense regarding her ability to find Appellant not guilty by reason of\n\ninsanity on a preponderance of the evidence, Matthews again asserted that she could do\n\nso. Matthews’s voir dire sufficiently supports the trial court’s ruling. See Davis, 329\n\nS.W.3d at 807. Point of error thirty-two is overruled.\n\n                                          L. Adair\n\n       Defense counsel raised three challenges for cause to Adair, all of which the trial\n\f                                                                                      Cade–92\ncourt denied. We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n       First, defense counsel argued that Adair would automatically vote for the death\n\npenalty. Defense counsel acknowledged that, during the State’s voir dire, Adair had\n\nindicated that he could and would follow all the law applicable to sentencing, but defense\n\ncounsel asserted that, during the defense’s voir dire, Adair “differentiated and went back\n\nand forth and vacillated on his true feelings,” such that counsel believed Adair’s “true\n\nopinion [was] that if somebody kills somebody, that they deserve to die.”\n\n       After reviewing Adair’s entire voir dire, we disagree that he took positions during\n\ndefense questioning that were materially different than the answers he gave during the\n\nState’s questioning. But even if we were to accept Appellant’s argument, we give\n\nparticular deference to the trial court’s ruling when a prospective juror vacillates or gives\n\nequivocal or contradictory answers concerning his ability to follow the law. Gardner, 306\n\nS.W.3d at 295.\n\n       Second, defense counsel argued that Adair would hold Appellant to a higher\n\nburden of proof than the law required regarding insanity. Defense counsel based his\n\nassertion on Adair’s response when the prosecutor questioned him about his answer to\n\nQuestion 38 of the juror questionnaire. Question 38 informed potential jurors that a\n\nperson with mental illness can receive life without parole or the death penalty for\n\ncommitting capital murder, then asked for the juror’s thoughts. Adair wrote, “Life\n\nwithout parole no death penalty on a person with mental illness.” The prosecutor\n\f                                                                                     Cade–93\nquestioned Adair as follows:\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: First of all, would you agree with me that anyone can\n       just claim they have a mental illness?\n\n       [ADAIR]: Yes.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Would you agree with me that mental illness\n       exists on a range of very mild, like a person with mild depression, all the\n       way up to severe where a person just doesn’t even understand the difference\n       between right and wrong?\n\n       [ADAIR]: Right.\n\n       [STATE]: Okay. Now, are you saying to me that, no matter what the extent\n       of the mental illness is, that you’ll never consider the death penalty, or are\n       you saying if they are on a far end of that scale that you wouldn’t consider\n       it?\n\n       [ADAIR]: No, on a far end.\n\nThis line of questioning and Adair’s “far end” response concerned a punishment issue\n\nrather than the affirmative defense of insanity. Appellant identifies nothing else in Adair’s\n\nvoir dire suggesting that he would elevate the burden of proof regarding the insanity\n\ndetermination, and we find nothing in our independent review.\n\n       Third, defense counsel asserted that Adair’s testimony when questioned about his\n\nwritten response to Question 17 of the questionnaire showed that he would require any\n\nevidence of remorse to come through Appellant’s testimony. Question 17 asked jurors\n\nwhat would be important to them in deciding whether a person received a death sentence\n\nrather than a life sentence in a capital-murder case. In pertinent part, Adair indicated that\n\na lack of remorse would be significant to him.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–94\n       The prosecutor informed Adair that a defendant has a constitutional right not to\n\ntestify and that if the defendant elects not to testify, a juror may not hold that choice\n\nagainst him. Adair stated that he could and would follow the law. When defense counsel\n\nquestioned Adair, counsel noted his mention of remorse in response to Question 17.\n\nDefense counsel asked whether Adair would require a defendant “to actually testify and\n\nsay, look, I’m sorry I did that, or something like that, in the punishment stage?” Adair\n\nsaid that he would not, but he struggled to explain:\n\n       No, I think the remorse would -- I don’t know if that’s a state of mind or it\n       goes along with like their moral [culpability]. I think it’s, you know, like\n       they have no feeling when they do it, you know, like they are not\n       remorse[ful] about killing another human being.\n\n       Defense counsel then suggested that a defendant’s testimony might be the only\n\nway for him to provide evidence of remorse:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. Do you see where I’m coming from? To actually -- I\n       mean the way we give information to each other is either through, you\n       know, some kind of gesture, words, or writings.\n\n       [ADAIR]: Right, right, right. I guess --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And, so, I guess my question is, you know, how would you\n       receive the information about if a person was remorseful, you know, if you\n       didn’t require him to testify or give you some information about remorse,\n       like I’m sorry or something?\n\n       [ADAIR]: I guess explaining through the act of violence, I guess that would\n       be --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Are you saying that, during the act of violence, they would\n       have to say, I’m sorry, or something like [that]?\n\f                                                                                      Cade–95\n       [ADAIR]: No, just, or their mental, trying to say their state of mind at the\n       time of doing the crime.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. I guess I’m confused. I am totally confused in that\n       sense.\n\n       [ADAIR]: I’m a little confused myself.\n\nWhen defense counsel again asked Adair to explain how one would know whether\n\nsomeone was remorseful or not, Adair responded, “I guess through their actions, maybe\n\nyou could tell. I don’t know, if they were crying or I guess however you could tell\n\nwhether they are remorse[ful] or not.”\n\n       It was within the trial court’s discretion to deny Appellant’s challenge for cause.\n\nThe proponent of a cause-based challenge must show that the challenge is proper and\n\ndoes not meet this burden until, among other things, he demonstrates that the law was\n\nexplained to and understood by the venire member. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. When the\n\nprosecutor explained a defendant’s constitutional right not to testify, Adair stated that he\n\ncould and would follow the law. When defense counsel discussed the topic, it was in the\n\ncontext of how jurors could ascertain whether a defendant felt remorse. Defense counsel\n\ndid not explain to Adair that jurors could determine whether a defendant felt remorse at\n\nthe time of the offense by drawing reasonable inferences from circumstantial evidence\n\npresented at trial. See Snowden v. State, 353 S.W.3d 815, 823–24 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\nRather, it seems that counsel inaccurately implied through his questions that only the\n\ndefendant, by testifying, could supply such evidence. Despite the apparent misdirection,\n\f                                                                                       Cade–96\nAdair evinced an understanding that circumstantial evidence may provide a basis for\n\ninferring remorse. Appellant points to nothing in the record to show that Adair could not\n\nor would not consider such circumstantial evidence, if it were offered, or that he would\n\nrequire evidence of remorse to come from Appellant himself. Point of error thirty-four is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                    M. Koshy and Newton\n\n       Because Appellant received two additional peremptory strikes, he can demonstrate\n\nharm only by showing that the trial court erroneously denied at least three of his\n\nchallenges for cause to the seventeen veniremembers at issue in points of error eighteen\n\nthrough thirty-four. See Chambers, 866 S.W.2d at 23. We have reviewed Appellant’s\n\nchallenges for cause to fifteen of those potential jurors and found no error by the trial\n\ncourt. Accordingly, even if we assume that the trial court erred in denying Appellant’s\n\nchallenges for cause to the two remaining veniremembers at issue, Koshy and Newton,\n\nAppellant cannot show harm on appeal. See id. Points of error nineteen and twenty are\n\noverruled.\n\n                    VIII. V OIR DIRE—R EMAINING POINTS OF ERROR\n\n       In point of error thirty-five, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred by not\n\npermitting defense counsel to ask venire member Morgan about the types of evidence she\n\nmight consider mitigating. During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor explained to\n\nMorgan that jurors must be able to consider all of the evidence, including evidence of the\n\f                                                                                       Cade–97\nvictims’ experience of the offense, when answering the mitigation special issue. See Art.\n\n37.071, § 2(e)(1). When questioning Morgan, defense counsel referred to the State’s point\n\nabout considering the victims’ perspective. Defense counsel asserted that evidence\n\nconcerning the victims’ experience of the offense could have mitigating or aggravating\n\nvalue. Defense counsel asked Morgan if she could foresee circumstances in which such\n\nevidence could be mitigating. After Morgan responded that she could, defense counsel\n\nasked her to give examples, at which point the State successfully objected.\n\n       We review a trial court’s ruling that limits voir dire questioning for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Hernandez v. State, 390 S.W.3d 310, 315 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). Appellant\n\nacknowledges that we have previously held that questions such as the one defense\n\ncounsel posed are improper. See id. (“Whether a juror considers a particular type of\n\nevidence to be mitigating is not a proper area of inquiry.”). To the extent Appellant argues\n\nthat our precedent is inconsistent with the holding of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604\n\n(1978), we disagree. Lockett’s holding requires that the sentencer in a capital case not be\n\nprecluded from considering, as a mitigating factors, any aspect of the defendant’s\n\ncharacter, record, or any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as\n\na basis for a sentence less than death. Id. at 604. We see nothing in Lockett that permits a\n\ndefendant to ask a prospective juror the kind of question that Appellant sought to ask\n\nMorgan. The trial court did not abuse its discretion. Point of error thirty-five is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-six, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred during voir\n\f                                                                                     Cade–98\ndire when it allowed the prosecutor to misstate the law concerning the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue. The alleged misstatements occurred during the State’s\n\nquestioning of veniremembers Johnlouis and Evans.\n\n       The future-dangerousness special issue requires jurors to determine “whether there\n\nis a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would\n\nconstitute a continuing threat to society.” Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1). The record shows that\n\nthe prosecutor focused on the implications of the words “would” and “threat” in the\n\nspecial issue. The prosecutor asserted that the future-dangerousness special issue asks\n\njurors to consider what threat the defendant’s “mere existence” would pose, even\n\nassuming the possibility that he “would sit in his cell every day and never commit a\n\ncriminal act of violence.” Alternatively, the prosecutor explained that the special issue\n\nasks jurors to consider whether the defendant “would” commit criminal acts of violence\n\nthat would constitute a continuing threat to society, “if he could.” After the prosecution\n\nrephrased the question, the trial court overruled Appellant’s objections that the\n\nprosecutor’s statements still misstated the law.\n\n       We have previously construed the future dangerousness issue as focusing on an\n\nindividual’s character for violence and his internal restraints, rather than merely the\n\nexternal restraints of incarceration and likelihood of incapacitation. See, e.g., Coble, 330\n\nS.W.3d at 268–69; Estrada v. State, 313 S.W.3d 274, 281–82 n.5 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\nThe prosecutor’s statements were generally consistent with this. Accordingly, we\n\f                                                                                        Cade–99\nconclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in overruling Appellant’s\n\nobjections. Further, the record shows that neither Johnlouis nor Evans served on\n\nAppellant’s jury. Thus, even if we were to determine that error occurred, it did not affect\n\nAppellant’s substantial rights. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 44.2(b). Point of error thirty-six is\n\noverruled.\n\n                 IX. C ONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES TO A RTICLE 37.071\n\n       In point of error thirty-seven, Appellant argues that Article 37.071, section 2(f)(4),\n\nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution because\n\nit limits the jurors’ consideration to evidence that implicates the defendant’s moral\n\nblameworthiness. In point of error thirty-eight, Appellant asserts that Article 37.071\n\nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it does not provide a burden of\n\nproof regarding the mitigation special issue. In point of error thirty-nine, Appellant\n\ncontends that the “10-12” provision found in Article 37.071, sections 2(d)(2) and (f)(2),\n\nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it misleads the jury. In point of\n\nerror forty, Appellant alleges that Article 37.071, section 2(f)(4), violates the Eighth\n\nAmendment because it does not require the jury to consider mitigating evidence, and for\n\nthe same reason, the trial court’s jury instruction pursuant to Article 37.071, section\n\n2(f)(4), also violated the Eighth Amendment. In point of error forty-one, Appellant\n\ncontends that Article 37.071, section 2(a), violates the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments because it prohibits the jury from being informed about the consequences of\n\f                                                                                    Cade–100\na single holdout juror. In point of error forty-two, Appellant asserts that Texas’s capital\n\nsentencing scheme violates the Supreme Court’s holding in Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 583\n\n(2002). In point of error forty-three, Appellant avers that Article 37.071, section 2(b)(1),\n\nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it does not define the terms\n\n“probability,” “continuing threat to society,” “criminal acts of violence,” and “continuing\n\nthreat.” In point of error forty-four, Appellant alleges that Article 37.071 violates the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding in Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), because it does not\n\nprovide a method by which the state determines a defendant’s death-worthiness.\n\n       Appellant acknowledges that we have previously rejected claims identical to points\n\nof error thirty-seven through thirty-nine and forty-one through forty-three. See, e.g.,\n\nCoble, 330 S.W.3d at 296; Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 694; Roberts v. State, 220 S.W.3d\n\n521, 534 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Although Appellant fails to mention controlling\n\nprecedent from this Court, we have previously rejected the claims he raises in points of\n\nerror forty and forty-four. See, e.g., Lucero v. State, 246 S.W.3d 86, 102 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2008); Saldano v. State, 232 S.W.3d 77, 108–09 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Appellant’s\n\narguments do not persuade us to revisit these issues. Points of error thirty-seven through\n\nforty-four are overruled.\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                                          Hervey, J.\n\nDelivered: February 25, 2015\n\f                 Cade–101\nDo Not Publish\n\f",

T EX. C ODE C RIM. P ROC. A RT. 37.071, § 2(g).1 Direct appeal to this\n\nCourt is automatic. Art. 37.071, § 2(h). Appellant raises forty-four points of error. After\n\nreviewing Appellant’s claims, we find them to be without merit. Consequently, we affirm\n\nthe trial court’s judgment and sentence.\n\n                                  I. F ACTS OF THE OFFENSE\n\n       The jury heard evidence that Appellant and Mischell Fuller had been romantically\n\ninvolved for a number of years. They had also lived together in Fuller’s house for several\n\nyears. Appellant’s eleven year-old daughter, Tyra Cade, and Fuller’s seventeen-year-old\n\ndaughter, Desaree Hoskins, lived with them. Desaree was Fuller’s daughter with her ex-\n\nhusband, Karlton Hoskins, who was in prison when Fuller and Appellant began dating.\n\nMichael Hoskins, Fuller’s older child with Karlton, lived in Denton.\n\n       Although Appellant was still living in Fuller’s house at the time of the killings,\n\ntheir relationship had deteriorated due to various factors. One factor was Karlton’s 2009\n\nrelease from a Florida prison, after which he began to reestablish a relationship with\n\nMichael and Desaree. Fuller greatly encouraged Karlton’s efforts. Although Karlton lived\n\nin Florida, he became a presence in Fuller’s and the children’s lives. Appellant, who was\n\njealous and possessive of Fuller, disliked her contact with Karlton. He suspected Fuller of\n\nrekindling a romantic relationship with Karlton and told her that he did not want her ex-\n\nhusband to call the house. Even before Karlton’s renewed presence, Fuller had repeatedly\n\n       1\n       Unless otherwise stated, all future references to Articles are to the Texas Code of\nCriminal Procedure.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–3\n\nasked Appellant to move out. Appellant refused, and after one such request made shortly\n\nbefore the killings, threatened to burn the house down with Fuller in it. Although Fuller\n\nand Appellant still slept in the same bed, they had not been sexually intimate in several\n\nmonths.\n\n       The killings occurred sometime in the early hours of March 27, 2011. Later that\n\nday, Appellant turned himself in by calling 9-1-1 from a pay phone in a police station\n\nlobby. After receiving Miranda2 warnings, Appellant gave officers video-recorded\n\nstatements in which he confessed to the killings in detail. According to his statements, on\n\nthe evening of March 26, 2011, he hid a recording device near Fuller’s side of the bed,\n\nthen went to a strip club with his cousin. After a few hours in the club, followed by an\n\nunsuccessful search for prostitutes, Appellant returned to Fuller’s house around 2:00 a.m.\n\nThe recording device had captured a Skype conversation between Fuller and Karlton, and\n\nAppellant listened to it when he returned home. Roughly two hours into the recording,\n\nAppellant heard the conversation become sexual in nature.\n\n       Soon thereafter, Appellant got into bed with Fuller, who fell asleep but was later\n\nawakened by Appellant’s tossing and turning in bed. When Fuller told Appellant to lie down\n\nand go to sleep, Appellant showed Fuller a kitchen knife. Fuller began screaming when she\n\nsaw the knife, and Appellant repeatedly stabbed her. Fuller’s screams woke Desaree, who\n\nran into the bedroom to help her mother. Appellant stabbed Desaree several times and then\n\n\n\n       2\n           Miranda v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966).\n\f                                                                                          Cade–4\n\nreturned to Fuller. When Desaree started to get up, Appellant stabbed her again multiple\n\ntimes as she screamed and attempted to crawl away from him. When Desaree stopped\n\nscreaming and moving, Appellant walked back to Fuller, who was still alive and conscious.\n\nAppellant vaginally and anally raped Fuller, claiming that he ejaculated “[i]n her, on her,\n\neverywhere” because she made him feel like a sex offender.3 Appellant believed Fuller lived\n\nfor thirty to forty minutes after he first stabbed her, and he asserted that he sexually assaulted\n\nher for twenty to thirty minutes of that time. While he was sexually assaulting Fuller,\n\nAppellant heard Desaree speaking. He believed that Desaree survived longer than Fuller.\n\n       Officers found Fuller’s body in the master bedroom, face down and naked below\n\nthe waist. Fuller’s buttocks and vaginal area were propped up on several pillows; a bottle\n\nof lubricant lay next to her body. Desaree’s body was in the hallway, immediately outside\n\nthe bedroom. In a bathroom, officers found a bloody knife and notebook containing\n\nAppellant’s handwritten notes. Appellant wrote that Fuller had “kicked [him] to the curb”\n\nwhen she began trying to mend the relationship between Karlton and her children.\n\nAppellant also wrote that, because he could not live without Fuller, he took Fuller from\n\nhimself and “from . . . anyone else.” Although he expressed remorse for the killings,\n\n\n       3\n         When Fuller and Appellant began dating, he was facing charges in Collin County for the\n1999 aggravated sexual assault of Charity Trice. As we discuss in greater detail regarding point\nof error fifteen, a jury subsequently convicted Appellant of that offense. The convicting court\nsentenced him to a three-year term of community supervision that included a ninety-day jail term\nas a condition of community supervision. The community-supervision conditions also required\nAppellant to register as a sex offender and attend a sex-offender treatment program. After\nAppellant was terminated from his sex-offender treatment program, the convicting court revoked\nhis community supervision and sentenced him to three years in prison.\n\f                                                                                        Cade–5\n\nAppellant also frequently deflected responsibility away from himself, writing, for\n\nexample, “[Fuller] used to treat me so good. Not like a sex offender”; “I’m truly sorry,\n\nshe drove me crazy trying to fix things with her kids and the father”; “I feel bad for so\n\nmany people, especially who knew . . . [Fuller]. All I can say is she had a bad side . . . . It\n\nwasn’t always sunshine”; and “Thank Karlton Hoskins for this one.”\n\n       The medical examiner, Jill Urban, M.D., testified that Fuller died from being\n\nstabbed twenty-eight times. Urban found defensive wounds on Fuller’s hands and wrists.\n\nSeveral wounds to Fuller’s face, neck, and chest area were between four and five inches\n\ndeep. Desaree’s death resulted from thirty-nine stab wounds, many of which were also\n\nbetween four and five inches deep. Urban testified that the perpetrator used a great deal of\n\nforce in inflicting Desaree’s injuries, noting that the wounds penetrated her bones.\n\n                                    II. I NSANITY DEFENSE\n\n       In point of error seven, Appellant contends that the evidence of his insanity so\n\ngreatly outweighed the State’s contrary evidence when viewed in a neutral light that the\n\nverdict is manifestly unjust. We disagree.\n\n       Texas law excuses a defendant from criminal responsibility if he proves, by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, the affirmative defense of insanity. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE\n\n§ 8.01(a). The relevant inquiry is whether, at the time of the charged conduct, and as the\n\nresult of a severe mental disease or defect, the defendant did not know that his conduct\n\nwas wrong.

In reviewing a rejected\n\naffirmative defense such as insanity, we consider all of the evidence relevant to that\n\ndefense in a neutral light. Matlock v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\nAlthough the Court views the relevant evidence in a neutral light, we may not usurp the\n\njury’s function by substituting our judgment for the jury’s assessment of witness\n\ncredibility and the weight of the evidence. Id.\n\n       To support his insanity defense, Appellant offered lay testimony from his half-\n\nbrother, Gregory Scott. Scott asserted that Appellant suffered from a severe mental defect\n\nand did not know his conduct was wrong when he killed Fuller and Desaree. Scott\n\ntestified that he was four years older than Appellant and lived with Appellant, their\n\nmother, and Appellant’s biological father, Jerry Cade Ford, until the age of six or seven.\n\nScott, who asserted that he and Appellant came from a “crazy bloodline,” testified that\n\nFord had mental problems. After the age of six or seven, Scott lived with his\n\ngrandparents. He had minimal contact with Appellant until they were both adults and\n\ntheir now-deceased mother became terminally ill. Scott testified that he and Appellant had\n\ndifficult childhoods because their mother and Ford frequently abused each other in front\n\nof them. According to Scott, Appellant seemed different and emotionally unstable after\n\nserving a prison sentence for aggravated sexual assault. Scott also asserted that\n\nAppellant’s mental state at the time of the offense was unstable, primarily due to chronic\n\nback pain that Appellant self-treated with pain patches. Scott admitted that he had\n\f                                                                                     Cade–7\n\ndisliked Fuller and that he had suggested that Appellant place the recording device near\n\nher bed.\n\n       Appellant also presented testimony from three psychologists: Daniel Altman,\n\nMichael Gottlieb, and Gilda Kessner. Dr. Altman testified that he reviewed Ford’s\n\nmental-health records, which showed that Ford had been diagnosed with schizophrenia\n\nand schizoaffective disorder. Altman told the jury that, based on heritability research and\n\nFord’s diagnoses, Appellant had a 9–18% risk of developing the characteristics of\n\nschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. On cross-examination, Altman acknowledged\n\nthat he did not examine or purport to diagnose Appellant with schizophrenia or any other\n\nmental illness. He also stated that, in males, schizophrenia usually appears by a person’s\n\nmid-twenties, and that it would be very unlikely for a thirty-eight-year-old male\n\n(Appellant’s age at the time of the offense) to spontaneously develop schizophrenia.\n\nMoreover, according to Altman, the vast majority of people with mental illnesses,\n\nincluding schizophrenics, understand the difference between right and wrong.\n\n       Dr. Gottlieb testified that he learned through defense counsel of allegations that\n\nAppellant’s mother and cousins sexually abused Appellant as a child. Gottlieb told the\n\njury that some sexually abused children may develop psychological symptoms during\n\nadulthood. These symptoms can include internalizing and externalizing behavior,\n\nphysiological symptoms, distorted perceptions as a result of their experiences, and other\n\nissues. However, the symptoms are nonspecific, meaning that they could originate from\n\f                                                                                          Cade–8\n\nsomething entirely unrelated to the earlier abuse, and there is no causal link between the\n\nearlier abuse and a particular psychological difficulty, if any, that subsequently develops.\n\nOn cross-examination, Gottlieb acknowledged that he received no independent\n\ncorroboration that the alleged sexual abuse actually occurred. And because he did not\n\nexamine Appellant or review any of his records, Gottlieb also could not say whether\n\nAppellant actually manifested any psychological symptoms that might be consistent with\n\nchildhood sexual abuse. Gottlieb further agreed that individuals who have been abused as\n\nchildren and develop psychological symptoms as adults are usually still able to conform\n\ntheir behavior to societal norms. Gottlieb offered no opinion concerning whether\n\nAppellant was insane at the time of the offense.\n\n        Defense counsel deposed Appellant’s father, Ford, in anticipation of Appellant’s\n\ncapital-murder trial. Following Gottlieb’s testimony, and in the jury’s presence, counsel\n\nread a portion of Ford’s deposition testimony into the record.4 In that excerpt, Ford\n\nasserted that he discovered Appellant’s mother performing fellatio on Appellant when\n\nAppellant was about two years old. Ford testified that he responded by hitting Appellant’s\n\nmother in the head with a hammer and stated that Appellant witnessed him inflict the\n\nblow.\n\n        Dr. Kessner acknowledged that she worked exclusively for the defense in capital\n\n\n\n        4\n         Over Appellant’s objection, the trial judge excluded portions of Ford’s videotaped\ndeposition. Appellant proffered the entire deposition for purposes of appeal. The excluded\nportion indicates that Ford gave his testimony while hospitalized for a physical illness.\n\f                                                                                           Cade–9\n\ncases. Kessner testified about a mental condition she called “abandonment rage,” which\n\nshe acknowledged was not a diagnosis included in the American Psychiatric\n\nAssociation’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Kessner testified that a person\n\nexperiencing “abandonment rage” exists in a state of autonomic arousal. She stated that\n\nsuch arousal limits cognitive processes and can cause an individual to lose control of his\n\nbehavior. Kessner asserted that a person who is experiencing stressors such as depression,\n\nchronic pain, after-effects of childhood and adult trauma, and the threat of losing an\n\nintimate partner would be more likely to enter a state of “abandonment rage” than a\n\nperson not subject to such stressors. She also asserted that an individual experiencing\n\n“abandonment rage” would not know, at the moment of violence, that his conduct was\n\nwrong. Kessner testified that there was a high probability that Appellant suffered from\n\n“abandonment rage.” Kessner acknowledged, however, that she did not personally\n\nexamine Appellant in preparation for her testimony.5 Based on the information she\n\nreviewed, and after vacillating greatly, Kessner ultimately stated that is was her opinion\n\nthat Appellant had a severe mental disease or defect at the time of the offense and did not\n\nknow that his conduct was wrong.\n\n       In rebuttal, the State presented the testimony of Tim Proctor, Ph.D., a forensic\n\npsychologist. Dr. Proctor testified that he has worked as an expert witness for both the\n\n\n\n       5\n        Kessner testified that she relied on the report prepared by the State’s expert witness, Tim\nProctor; the notebook found at the crime scene; some letters written by Appellant after the\noffense; conversations with defense counsel; and some professional literature.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–10\n\nState and the defense. Proctor also stated that he personally evaluated Appellant for over\n\nfive hours and conducted a comprehensive record review. That review included records\n\nof the instant offense, including police reports, Appellant’s 9-1-1 call, and Appellant’s\n\nsubsequent statements to police; the psychological evaluation conducted by mental-health\n\nstaff at the jail immediately following Appellant’s arrest; records of Appellant’s mental-\n\nhealth treatment while awaiting trial; police, community supervision, and prison records\n\nassociated with Appellant’s prior arrests and convictions; Appellant’s school,\n\nemployment, and medical records; and the mental-health records of Appellant’s father.\n\nProctor testified that clinical notes reflected the staff’s observations that Appellant\n\nmisrepresented, exaggerated, or completely lied about his mental condition in order to be\n\nmoved to a preferred-housing area. The notes further memorialized Appellant’s\n\nadmission that he cut his own wrist to make it look as if he were suicidal, so that jail\n\nofficials would transfer him from the administrative-segregation housing unit.\n\n       Proctor told the jury that, before the offense, Appellant showed some depressive\n\nsymptoms due to a back injury, but the symptoms did not rise to the level of a severe\n\nmental disease or defect or “anywhere close.” Following the killings and Appellant’s\n\nincarceration on capital-murder charges, psychological staff at the jail diagnosed\n\nAppellant with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and treated him with the lowest\n\nsuggested therapeutic dose of a common antidepressant. Proctor described Appellant’s\n\ndepression as mild and stated that the adjustment disorder reflected Appellant’s reaction\n\nto his current legal difficulties. Proctor also testified that neither of Appellant’s current\n\f                                                                                       Cade–11\n\ndiagnoses reached the level of a severe mental disease, and he opined that Appellant had\n\nno severe mental disease or defect at the time of the offense. Therefore, Proctor\n\nconcluded, Appellant knew when he killed Fuller and Desaree that what he was doing\n\nwas wrong.\n\n       After reviewing all of the relevant evidence in a neutral light, we cannot conclude\n\nthat Appellant’s evidence of insanity greatly outweighed the contrary evidence such that it\n\nrenders the jury’s determination manifestly unjust, conscience-shocking, or clearly biased.\n\nMatlock, 392 S.W.3d at 671. Point of error seven is overruled.\n\n       In point of error two, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by not admitting\n\nFord’s entire videotaped deposition into evidence over the State’s relevance objection.\n\nSee T EX. R. E VID. 401, 402. Appellant asserts that the excluded portion of the deposition,\n\nin which Ford discussed his own mental-health history, was relevant to Appellant’s\n\ninsanity defense. Appellant alleges that the trial judge’s failure to admit Ford’s entire\n\ndeposition violated his Sixth Amendment right to due process by impeding his ability to\n\npresent a complete defense. In point of error three, relying on the same arguments,\n\nAppellant alleges that the trial court erred by sustaining the State’s relevance objection to\n\nthe proposed testimony of Lilly Mae Ware, Ford’s niece and caretaker.\n\n       When a trial court sustains the State’s objection to the admission of a defendant’s\n\nevidence, a federal due process violation may arise only if (1) a state evidentiary rule\n\ncategorically and arbitrarily prohibits the defendant from offering otherwise relevant,\n\nreliable evidence vital to his defense; or (2) the trial court’s clearly erroneous ruling\n\f                                                                                     Cade–12\n\nresults in the exclusion of admissible evidence that forms the vital core of a defendant’s\n\ntheory of defense and effectively prevents him from presenting that defense. Easley v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (quoting Walters v. State, 247\n\nS.W.3d. 204, 219 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)). Appellant does not contend that a state\n\nevidentiary rule categorically and arbitrarily prohibited him from offering the testimony at\n\nissue. Therefore, we consider only whether the trial court’s rulings that excluded the\n\nremainder of Ford’s deposition and Ware’s proposed testimony were clearly erroneous\n\nand whether the excluded evidence was so vital to Appellant’s insanity defense that its\n\nexclusion effectively prevented him from presenting that defense. See id.\n\n       In his excluded deposition testimony, Ford stated that he had been diagnosed with\n\nschizophrenia and bipolar disorder in his late twenties, he had been hospitalized many\n\ntimes due to those conditions, and he had been prescribed various psychiatric medications\n\nto treat his illnesses. Ford also described his disordered-thought processes and auditory\n\nand visual hallucinations. Ford testified that his parents had no history of mental illness\n\nand that none of his nine children had been diagnosed with any mental illness. Ware\n\nproposed to testify about the history and characteristics of Ford’s mental illnesses and\n\noffer her opinion that six of Ford’s children, including Appellant, had mental illness. But\n\nin her proffered testimony, Ware admitted that she was not trained to diagnose mental\n\nillnesses and had spent no significant time with Appellant.\n\n       Appellant is not entitled to relief. The trial court’s rulings excluding the remainder\n\nof Ford’s deposition and Ware’s proposed testimony on relevance grounds were not an\n\f                                                                                      Cade–13\n\nabuse of discretion. Shuffield v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1401705\"><a href=\"/opinion/1401705/shuffield-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\nFurther, the trial court’s rulings did not impede Appellant’s ability to present his insanity\n\ndefense. See Easley, 424 S.W.3d at 540. The issue central of Appellant’s insanity defense\n\nwas whether, at the time of the offense and as the result of a severe mental disease or\n\ndefect, Appellant did not know that his conduct was wrong. The excluded testimony\n\ncentered on Ford’s mental health, not Appellant’s. Appellant presented no evidence that,\n\nlike Ford, he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In addition, the\n\njury learned of Ford’s mental-health history and diagnoses through other witnesses,\n\nincluding Appellant’s half-brother and Dr. Altman. Points of error two and three are\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error four, Appellant alleges that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nnot allowing Dr. Antoinette McGarrahan, a forensic neuropsychologist, to testify at the\n\nguilt-innocence phase that Appellant exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder\n\n(PTSD) and depression and that he scored in the borderline range of intellectual\n\nfunctioning.\n\n       The trial court held a hearing to determine the admissibility of McGarrahan’s\n\ntestimony. McGarrahan stated that she did not evaluate Appellant for insanity at the time\n\nof the offense and had no opinion on that issue. Based on her evaluation and testing of\n\nAppellant, McGarrahan planned to testify that Appellant had borderline-to-low-average\n\nintellectual functioning and exhibited some symptoms associated with depression and\n\nPTSD. McGarrahan stated that Appellant obtained an IQ score of 80 during her testing,\n\f                                                                                         Cade–14\n\nbut she also stated that she had no opinion regarding whether Appellant’s IQ rendered\n\nhim unable to understand that his conduct was wrong at the time of the offense.6\n\n\n       6\n         Although McGarrahan declined to render an opinion as to whether Appellant’s IQ score\nof 80 allowed him to understand that his conduct was wrong at the time of the offense, she did\nmake general statements with respect to a person with an IQ of approximately 80,\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. With respect to Mr. Cade’s IQ being an 80 -- and that’s\n       what your testimony is; is that correct?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Yes, that’s what he tested at.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Are you representing in your opinion that that is a severe\n       mental disease or defect?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: No, I’m not.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: And is it your -- so that is not your opinion?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Correct.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Have you ever rendered an opinion saying that an IQ of 80\n       would be a severe mental disease or defect?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: No.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Is a person with an IQ of 80 able to discern right from wrong?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Based solely on their intellect, yes.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: So there’s nothing with respect to his IQ that would relate to\n       an opinion of yours that at the time of the offense he did or did not have a severe\n       mental disease or defect or that he was or was not able to understand what he was\n       doing was wrong?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Correct.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: And with respect to mental retardation, you are in no way\n       saying the defendant is mentally retarded, are you?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: That’s correct.\n\f                                                                                    Cade–15\n\nMcGarrahan found that Appellant exhibited a depressed affect during her evaluation, but\n\nshe did not know when the symptoms first appeared or whether they played a role in his\n\ncommission of the offense. She also believed that it was possible that most of Appellant’s\n\ndepressive symptoms stemmed from the fact that he was incarcerated and facing capital-\n\nmurder charges. McGarrahan additionally acknowledged that she did not actually\n\ndiagnose Appellant with PTSD, she did not know when the PTSD-like symptoms first\n\nappeared, she could not exclude the possibility that his symptoms could be entirely due to\n\nhis recent commission of a double homicide, and she did not know whether the symptoms\n\nplayed any role in his commission of the offense.\n\n       The trial judge’s decision to exclude McGarrahan’s testimony at the guilt-\n\ninnocence phase due to lack of relevance fell well within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. Shuffield, 189 S.W.3d at 793. McGarrahan had no opinion regarding\n\nwhether Appellant was insane at the time of the killing—the purpose for which Appellant\n\noffered her testimony. See Easley, 424 S.W.3d at 540. Point of error four is overruled.\n\n            III. S UFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE—F UTURE DANGEROUSNESS\n\n       In point of error fifteen, Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsustain the jury’s affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. The\n\nfuture-dangerousness special issue requires the jury to determine “whether there is a\n\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Can you categorically say the defendant is not mentally\n       retarded?\n\n       [McGARRAHAN]: Yes.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–16\n\nprobability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would\n\nconstitute a continuing threat to society.” Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1). When reviewing the\n\nlegal sufficiency of the evidence supporting an affirmative answer to the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict. Williams v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2190742\"><a href=\"/opinion/2190742/williams-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (Tex.

Assessing the evidence and all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict, we determine whether any\n\nrational trier of fact could have believed beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a\n\nprobability the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. Williams, 273 S.W.3d. at 213.\n\n       Both the facts of the offense and other evidence showing Appellant’s escalating\n\npattern of violence and disrespect for the law were sufficient to support the jury’s\n\naffirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. See Swain v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1490445\"><a href=\"/opinion/1490445/swain-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370 (Tex.

Crim. App. 2011). Regarding the facts of the offense, we have recognized\n\nthat a stabbing death is particularly brutal. King v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518709\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518709/king-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1997). “[A] knife is a weapon which by its very nature, forces the user to be\n\nin such close proximity to his victim that he is often touching him or comes into contact\n\nwith him on each blow.” Id. (quoting Martinez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2435875\"><a href=\"/opinion/2435875/martinez-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1996)). Further, “the character of the weapon is such that several thrusts are often\n\f                                                                                      Cade–17\n\nutilized in order to ensure death—each additional thrust potentially indicating to any\n\nrational juror that such a personal act requires a wanton and callous disregard for human\n\nlife.” Id.\n\n        Here, the evidence showed that Appellant stabbed Fuller twenty-eight times and\n\nDesaree thirty-nine times, using great force to inflict deep, painful wounds. By\n\nAppellant’s own estimate, Fuller and Desaree both had between thirty and forty minutes\n\nto experience the pain and terror of his attack before they died. For Fuller, this interval\n\nincluded a vaginal and anal sexual assault while she was dying but still conscious and\n\nable to experience pain and fear. While sexually assaulting Fuller, Appellant was aware\n\nthat Desaree was still alive, within close proximity of her mother’s ongoing sexual\n\nassault, and sufficiently conscious to speak. In short, the sheer brutality and depravity of\n\nthe killings could convince a jury that Appellant poses a future danger to society. Even if\n\nthe jury had been inclined to find that Appellant’s conduct stemmed from an isolated\n\nincident of rage, it could have rationally concluded from the results that Appellant’s “rage\n\nis of such an uncontrollable and extreme nature that he is a continuing danger to society.”\n\nSonnier v.

Trice testified that, when\n\nshe was twenty-one-years old, she met Appellant in a laundromat and exchanged numbers\n\nwith him. Eventually, she invited Appellant to have drinks with her and her co-workers\n\nafter work. Trice rode to the bar with a co-worker and was there for between one and two\n\nhours before asking Appellant to drive her home. Trice had a new apartment, was proud\n\nof it, and invited Appellant in to see it. After they talked for a bit, Trice went into her\n\nbedroom and closed the door to pack because she intended to stay the night at a friend’s\n\nhouse.\n\n         As she went to the front door to leave her apartment, Appellant grabbed her arm\n\nand refused to let her leave. Trice testified that Appellant told her that he “wanted [her]\n\npussy” and threw her to the ground. When Trice tried to fight him, Appellant told her,\n\n“Don’t make me kill you like the last girl.” Because Trice believed Appellant would kill\n\nher if she did not yield to his advances, she pretended to welcome the sexual contact and\n\nled Appellant into her bedroom to get him as far from the front door as possible so she\n\ncould escape. In the bedroom, Appellant never let go of her wrist as he made her remove\n\nher clothing and then engaged in vaginal intercourse with her. Afterward, Appellant\n\f                                                                                    Cade–19\n\nforced Trice to stand over him as he performed oral sex on her.\n\n       The moment Trice felt she could safely escape, she wrapped herself in a blanket\n\nbecause she was naked and ran to a neighbor’s apartment where she waited for police.\n\nTrice sustained injuries to her wrist, chin, hands, and forehead. Appellant had left the\n\nscene by the time police arrived, but he left a message on Trice’s answering machine the\n\nnext day apologizing for the previous night. Appellant was convicted by a jury and\n\nsentenced to three years’ community supervision. As a condition of his community\n\nsupervision, Appellant served ninety days in jail. He was also required to register as a sex\n\noffender and attend a sex-offender treatment program.\n\n       The jury also heard evidence of Appellant’s behavior and attitude following his\n\naggravated-sexual-assault conviction. Mercedes Sabal, Appellant’s community-\n\nsupervision officer for that offense, asserted that, while Appellant was incarcerated, he\n\nwas critical of his past decisions and expressed willingness to adhere to his community-\n\nsupervision conditions. However, following Appellant’s release from jail, he “had an\n\nabout face,” told Sabal he would not adhere to the conditions, and denied his guilt,\n\ncontending that Trice consented to their encounter.\n\n       Al Merchant led the sex-offender treatment program that Appellant was required\n\nto attend. Merchant testified that, during the initial assessment, he found Appellant to be\n\nextremely manipulative. Appellant denied having sexually assaulted Trice, asserting that\n\nhe and Trice were engaged in consensual sex when her boyfriend or husband interrupted\n\f                                                                                         Cade–20\n\nthem. Merchant testified that at the first group session, Appellant continued to maintain\n\nhis innocence. Appellant also attempted to cry in front of the group, a behavior that\n\nMerchant surmised was not a genuine emotional response and further exemplified\n\nAppellant’s willingness to try to manipulate people. Appellant skipped his second session.\n\nAt his third session, which was ultimately his last session, Appellant was evasive,\n\nargumentative, disruptive, and manipulative. As a result, Merchant testified, he\n\nterminated Appellant from the program. In the discharge summary, Merchant wrote that\n\nAppellant’s recidivism risk was extremely high.\n\n       Following Appellant’s termination from the treatment program, the court revoked\n\nhis community supervision and sentenced him to three years in prison. Appellant’s\n\ndisciplinary records while incarcerated showed that Appellant was found in possession of\n\ncontraband and had an altercation with another inmate, during which Appellant suffered a\n\nblack eye and the other inmate suffered a fractured thumb.\n\n       The jury additionally heard evidence that, in 1993, Appellant asked his cousin,\n\nAshton Scott,7 to help him confront a man named Edward Watts. When the two men\n\nfound Watts, Watts pointed a gun at them and Ashton left. After someone later shot Watts\n\nin the back, police officers arrested Ashton for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nAfter making bail, Ashton confronted Appellant, who admitted to shooting Watts with a\n\nshotgun. Ashton asked Appellant to confess to the police, but Appellant refused. The\n\n\n\n       7\n           To distinguish him from Gregory Scott, we hereafter refer to Ashton Scott as “Ashton.”\n\f                                                                                       Cade–21\n\npolice eventually dropped the charges against Ashton, and no one was convicted for\n\nshooting Watts. Ashton also testified that, in 2002, Appellant hit their uncle in the face\n\nwith a beer bottle during an altercation, and that his uncle bled profusely.\n\n       Bobbi Jo Klute dated Appellant off and on for a few years in the mid 1990s. Klute\n\ntestified that, while they were dating, Appellant threw a beer bottle at her vehicle\n\nwindshield after the two argued in her car. She also stated that, during a period that they\n\nwere not dating, Klute was at her father’s house with a male friend when Appellant\n\nkicked in the door, entered the living room, and assaulted Klute’s friend. On another\n\noccasion, Klute and her son were visiting her son’s father, and although Klute and\n\nAppellant were not dating at the time, Appellant showed up, knocked on the door, and\n\nasked her to leave with him. Klute did so to avoid a confrontation. Appellant sometimes\n\ntold Klute that if he could not have her, no one could. Klute grew afraid of Appellant and\n\ntried to end their relationship permanently, but Appellant refused to accept the decision\n\nand harassed her for months. He would call Klute from a pay phone located near her\n\nhouse, follow her, and enter her home without her permission while she was away.\n\n       Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s affirmative answer to the future-dangerousness special issue. Point of\n\nerror fifteen is overruled.\n\n                    IV. R EMAINING GUILT– INNOCENCE ALLEGATIONS\n\n       In point of error one, Appellant claims that the trial court erred by permitting\n\f                                                                                           Cade–22\n\ntwo witnesses to testify that, in March 2011, Fuller told them that Appellant had\n\nthreatened her when she asked him to move out.

Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 (2004); and was unfairly prejudicial\n\nunder Rule 403 of the Texas Rules of Evidence.9 This point of error is multifarious\n\nbecause it is based on more than one legal theory. T EX. R. A PP. P. 38.1; Davis v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2284260\"><a href=\"/opinion/2284260/davis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 820 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). However, we will review Appellant’s\n\nallegations in the interest of justice.\n\n       The witnesses in question were Elena Belcher, Fuller’s mother, and Sandra\n\nHopkins, Fuller’s friend. The trial court permitted Belcher to testify that, shortly before\n\nher death, Fuller said she was going to replace her smoke detector and install a house\n\nalarm because, when Fuller had asked Appellant to move out of her house, Appellant\n\nthreatened to burn the house down with Fuller in it. The trial court allowed Hopkins to\n\ntestify about a conversation with Fuller, during which Fuller made substantially similar\n\nstatements to her.\n\n\n\n       8\n          “‘Hearsay’ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the\ntrial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” TEX . R. EVID .\n801(d).\n       9\n         Rule 403 provides that, “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\nmisleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative\nevidence.” TEX . R. EVID . 403. Unless otherwise stated, all future references to “Rules” refer to\nthe Texas Rules of Evidence.\n\f                                                                                      Cade–23\n\n       Even assuming that the trial court erred by overruling Appellant’s hearsay and\n\nRule 403 objections, the error did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights. See T EX. R.\n\nA PP. P. 44.2(b). The evidence of Appellant’s guilt was overwhelming without Belcher’s\n\nand Hopkins’s objected-to testimony. In addition, the relevant testimony did not\n\nmaterially weaken Appellant’s affirmative defense of insanity. In short, the testimony did\n\nnot have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s verdict.\n\nSee Coble v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274174\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274174/coble-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\n       Appellant’s Confrontation Clause argument also lacks merit. In Crawford, the\n\nSupreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of testimonial\n\nhearsay, and it stated that, at a minimum, the term “testimonial” applies to police\n\ninterrogations and prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a\n\nformer trial. See Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68; Woods v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1504749\"><a href=\"/opinion/1504749/woods-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2004). Accordingly, our threshold inquiry is whether the statements at issue\n\nwere testimonial or nontestimonial. The record shows that Fuller’s statements to Belcher\n\nand Hopkins were casual remarks that she made to her mother and a friend. We have\n\npreviously determined that similar casual remarks to acquaintances are nontestimonial for\n\nCrawford purposes. See Woods, 152 S.W.3d at 114. Point of error one is overruled.\n\n       In point of error five, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred in admitting\n\nState’s Exhibits 109–113 (crime scene photographs) over his Rule 403 objection.\n\nAppellant contends that the photographs were unfairly prejudicial because they were\n\f                                                                                     Cade–24\n\ngraphic and in color, most showed Fuller’s breasts and genitals, and the State had\n\nminimal need for the them. Appellant asserts that the sexual-assault evidence was not\n\nessential to the State’s case because the indictment did not charge him with having\n\nmurdered Fuller in the course of committing sexual assault.\n\n       The record shows that Appellant did not object to the admission of the photograph\n\nmarked as State’s Exhibit 111. Thus, Appellant did not preserve any alleged error for our\n\nreview regarding that exhibit. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1.\n\n       Regarding the remaining exhibits, Rule 403 requires that a photograph possess\n\nsome probative value and that its inflammatory nature not substantially outweigh that\n\nvalue. Williams v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1638295\"><a href=\"/opinion/1638295/williams-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). We review a trial\n\ncourt’s admission of photographs over a Rule 403 objection for an abuse of discretion. Id.\n\nWe examine several factors, including the photographs’ probative value, their potential to\n\nimpress the jury in some irrational and indelible way, the time needed to develop the\n\nevidence, and the proponent’s need for the photographs. Prible v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1369755\"><a href=\"/opinion/1369755/prible-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n733 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). We also consider the number of photographs, their\n\ngruesomeness, their level of detail, their size, whether they are in color or black-and-\n\nwhite, whether they are close-ups, whether they depict a clothed or nude body, the\n\navailability of other means of proof, and other circumstances unique to the individual\n\ncase. Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 690. When elements of a photograph are genuinely helpful\n\nto the jury in making its decision and the photograph’s power “emanates from nothing\n\f                                                                                     Cade–25\n\nmore than what the defendant himself has done[,] we cannot hold that the trial court has\n\nabused its discretion merely because it admitted the evidence.” Sonnier, 913 S.W.2d at\n\n519; see Prible, 175 S.W.3d at 734 n.20.\n\n       The record shows that police officers found Fuller’s body lying face-down on the\n\nmaster bedroom floor and naked below the waist. A bottle of lubricant lay next to Fuller’s\n\nbody. Her buttocks and vaginal area were elevated by pillows. The photographs at issue\n\nare in color and measure roughly 8 ½ x 12 inches. They reflect Fuller’s body as it\n\nappeared after forensic personnel lifted her shirt and rolled her body over to gauge the\n\nextent of her injuries. To the extent that Fuller’s body is shown in these photographs, she\n\nis on her back and naked except for a shirt that is pulled above her breasts.\n\n       State’s Exhibit 109 shows Fuller’s face and body to the knees. There are stab\n\nwounds on Fuller’s face, on the area between her breasts, on her right shoulder and upper\n\nchest area, and on her upper and lower right arm. A relatively small amount of blood is\n\nvisible on Fuller’s skin. Heavier blood stains appear on her shirt, the bedding material\n\nunderneath her, and the adjacent carpet. A bottle of lubricant near the body is partially\n\nvisible at the edge of the photograph. State’s Exhibit 110 is a closer view of Fuller’s\n\ntorso, from her navel to just below her chin. Wounds on Fuller’s right shoulder and upper\n\narm are visible, but the focus of the photograph is a stab wound between Fuller’s breasts.\n\nAs in State’s Exhibit 109, some blood is visible on Fuller’s skin. The quantity of blood\n\nthat stains Fuller’s shirt is more apparent than in State’s Exhibit 109. State’s Exhibit 112\n\f                                                                                      Cade–26\n\ngives a close-up view of wounds on Fuller’s right shoulder and upper chest area, right-\n\nupper arm, and right forearm. Fuller’s left breast, the blood-stained shirt pulled above the\n\nbreast, and a portion of her neck are visible. State’s Exhibit 113 shows Fuller’s body from\n\nthe neck to the knees. Wounds to the area between her breasts and right arm are visible,\n\nas is blood on her skin and shirt. The photograph is taken from approximately the same\n\ndistance but at a slightly different angle than State’s Exhibit 109. The bottle of lubricant\n\nthat was only partially visible in State’s Exhibit 109 is fully visible in State’s Exhibit 113.\n\n       The photographs showed evidence that was directly relevant to, and probative of,\n\nthe charged offense. Besides showing Fuller’s wounds, the photographs corroborated\n\nAppellant’s statements to police and witness testimony concerning the crime scene. See\n\nPrible, 175 S.W.3d at 731. To the extent that the photographs were also probative of the\n\nsexual assault, they constituted same-transaction contextual evidence. See id. at 732\n\n(“Same-transaction contextual evidence results when an extraneous matter is so\n\nintertwined with the State’s proof of the charged crime that avoiding reference to it would\n\nmake the State’s case incomplete or difficult to understand.”).\n\n       Further, the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the\n\nphotographs’ probative value. Whatever power the photographs possessed emanated\n\nprimarily from what Appellant himself did. See Sonnier, 913 S.W.2d at 519. Under these\n\ncircumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting State’s Exhibits\n\n109, 110, 112, and 113. Point of error five is overruled.\n\f                                                                                      Cade–27\n\n       In point of error six, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred by refusing to give\n\nhis proposed instruction on the lesser-included offense of murder:\n\n       If all of you do not agree by a preponderance of the evidence that as a result\n       of a severe mental disease or defect, the defendant did not know that his\n       conduct was wrong when he intentionally or knowingly caused the death of\n       [Fuller], but all of you agree that by preponderance of the evidence as a\n       result of a severe mental disease or defect, the defendant did not know that\n       his conduct was wrong when he intentionally or knowingly caused the death\n       of [Desaree,] then you will find the defendant not guilty by reason of\n       insanity as to the offense of capital murder [and] then you will consider\n       whether the defendant is guilty of the offense of murder of [Fuller].\n\n       We apply a two-step analysis to determine whether the jury should receive a lesser-\n\nincluded offense instruction. State v. Meru, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\nFirst, we ask whether the lesser-included offense’s elements are included within the proof\n\nnecessary to establish the charged offense’s elements. Id. at 162. If they are, we then\n\ninquire whether the record includes evidence that could allow a rational jury to find the\n\ndefendant guilty of only the lesser-included offense. Id.; see Art. 37.09; Feldman v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1662029\"><a href=\"/opinion/1662029/feldman-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750–51 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n\n       Appellant meets the first prong of the test; we have repeatedly held that murder is a\n\nlesser-included offense of capital murder. See, e.g., Smith v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2169006\"><a href=\"/opinion/2169006/smith-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2009). However, Appellant does not satisfy the second prong. Appellant\n\npoints us to the general circumstances of the offense and his statements in which he\n\nprofessed an inability to explain why he killed Desaree. But as the State notes, this\n\nevidence suggests that Appellant lacked a motive to kill Desaree. It does not provide a\n\f                                                                                       Cade–28\n\nrational basis for finding that, due to a severe mental disease or defect, when Appellant\n\nstabbed Desaree thirty-nine times, he did not know that his conduct was wrong.\n\n       Further, the evidence does not support a finding that Appellant’s state of mind\n\nwhen he killed Desaree was different from his state of mind when he killed Fuller. Dr.\n\nProctor, the State’s expert, testified that Appellant was sane during both killings.\n\nAppellant’s expert, Dr. Kessner, opined that Appellant was insane during both killings\n\nbecause he was in a state of “abandonment rage” and autonomic arousal from the moment\n\nFuller screamed (upon seeing Appellant in her bed with a knife) until “the violence\n\nstopped.” For the jury to find Appellant guilty of the lesser-included offense, it would\n\nnecessarily have to disregard both Proctor’s and Kessner’s testimony. It would have to\n\nfind that Appellant was thinking rationally when he began to stab Fuller, but he then\n\nentered a state of autonomic arousal (i.e., became insane) when Desaree entered the\n\nbedroom, and he began stabbing her. He then regained rational thought when he stopped\n\nstabbing Desaree and returned to stabbing Fuller. Finally, he returned to a state of\n\nautonomic arousal (i.e., became insane again) when Desaree began to get up, and he\n\nstabbed her multiple additional times. In short, the evidence could not allow a rational\n\njury to find Appellant guilty of only murder. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 750–51. Point of\n\nerror six is overruled.\n\n                    V. R EMAINING P UNISHMENT-PHASE ALLEGATIONS\n\f                                                                                      Cade–29\n\n       In points of error eight through ten, Appellant challenges the trial court’s rulings\n\nexcluding the punishment-phase testimony of his expert witnesses, Mark Vigen, Ph.D.\n\n(point of error 8) and Jonathan Sorensen, Ph.D. (point of error 9), and admitting the\n\ntestimony of the State’s expert, Travis Turner (point of error 10). Appellant alleges that\n\nthe trial court should have permitted Vigen, a psychologist, to testify that there was a high\n\nprobability that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) could control Appellant\n\nif the jury sentenced him to life without parole. Next, Appellant asserts that the trial court\n\nshould have allowed Sorensen, who holds a criminal-justice doctorate, to testify that\n\nindividuals convicted of homicides involving intimate partners are less likely than other\n\ninmates to commit violence in prison. Finally, Appellant contends that the trial court\n\nshould not have permitted Turner, a TDCJ classification officer, to testify about the types\n\nof weapons that prison inmates make.\n\n       The record shows that Turner first testified at a hearing outside the presence of the\n\njury and later in the presence of the jury during the State’s punishment case-in-chief.\n\nDuring the hearing outside the presence of the jury, Appellant objected on relevance\n\ngrounds to Turner’s proposed testimony about the kinds of inmate-made weapons he had\n\nencountered during his TDCJ career. Appellant argued that other inmates made the\n\nweapons in question, and that Appellant was not imprisoned when the discussed weapons\n\nwere found. The trial court overruled the objection, and Turner was excused. Later, when\n\nthe State recalled Turner in the presence of the jury, Turner testified about TDCJ’s\n\f                                                                                       Cade–30\n\ninmate-classification system, living conditions and restrictions within each classification\n\nof inmate, the general kinds of violence and disciplinary infractions that sometimes occur\n\nin prison, and the kinds of weapons that inmates have made. Turner offered no testimony\n\nrelating specifically to Appellant.\n\n       After the State rested its punishment case, Appellant called Johnny Lindsey to\n\ntestify. Lindsey, who told the jury that he spent twenty-six years in TDCJ for aggravated\n\nsexual assault until being exonerated by DNA testing, testified about the prison\n\nenvironment. On cross-examination, without a defense objection, Lindsey stated that\n\ninmates commonly made and possessed shanks.\n\n       After Lindsey testified, the trial court held a hearing outside the jury’s presence to\n\ndetermine the admissibility of testimony to be offered by defense witnesses S.O. Woods,\n\nSorensen, and Vigen as experts. See T EX. R. E VID. 702. Woods, a retired TDCJ\n\nclassifications officer, proposed to clarify aspects of Turner’s testimony regarding\n\nTDCJ’s inmate-classification system and ability to control inmates. After questioning\n\nWoods briefly, the State indicated that it did not object to his proposed testimony. Next,\n\nSorensen stated that he proposed to testify that inmates convicted of intimate-partner\n\nhomicides are less likely to commit acts of violence in prison than other inmates. The\n\nbasis of Sorensen’s opinion was his research, i.e., a study of TDCJ inmates convicted of\n\ncapital murder, murder, or manslaughter that involved the killing of an intimate partner.\n\n       The trial court continued the hearing to allow Sorensen to retrieve a copy of his\n\f                                                                                    Cade–31\n\nresearch. In the meantime, the jury heard testimony from two defense witnesses, one of\n\nwhom was Woods. On direct examination, Woods testified about TDCJ’s inmate-\n\nclassification system and ability to control inmates. On cross-examination, and without a\n\ndefense objection, Woods testified that prison inmates are very creative and can fashion\n\nalmost anything into a weapon, including shoe laces, combs, and handkerchiefs. Like\n\nTurner, Woods offered no testimony specifically related to Appellant.\n\n       When the hearing resumed, the State elicited testimony from Sorensen that his\n\nstudy was the first of its kind, incomplete, had not been peer reviewed or published, and\n\nno one had replicated his study’s results. Sorensen acknowledged that, although\n\nsuccessful peer review is some indication that a study “seems to look okay,” replication of\n\na study’s results, rather than peer review, validates the study. At the end of Sorensen’s\n\nhearing testimony, the trial court stated that it would review Kelly v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2430249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2430249/kelly-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572–73 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992), before deciding whether it would permit Sorensen\n\nto testify before the jury.\n\n       The trial court then heard from Vigen. Vigen stated that he had reviewed some\n\noffense and TDCJ records related to Appellant’s conviction and imprisonment for\n\naggravated sexual assault, but he had not personally examined him. Vigen proposed to\n\ntestify that TDCJ “has a high probability of controlling individual inmates.” He also\n\nstated that he based his opinion on thirty-five years of working as a psychologist in Texas\n\nprisons; five articles on prison violence written by other people including Sorensen;\n\f                                                                                     Cade–32\n\nVigen’s own co-authored article, in which he summarized research “indicating that a\n\nmajority of death row inmates do not exhibit violence in prison even in more open\n\ninstitutional settings”; and Turner’s and Woods’s testimony before the jury. Although\n\nVigen initially asserted that he would not offer an opinion specific to Appellant, he\n\nultimately stated that he would testify that there was a high probability that TDCJ could\n\ncontrol Appellant, in particular. When asked whether he based his opinion on anything\n\nindividual to Appellant, Vigen acknowledged that he had not evaluated Appellant but\n\nnoted that he had listened to Turner’s and Woods’s testimony.\n\n       The State objected to Vigen’s proposed testimony. It argued that Vigen was not\n\n“qualified” to render an opinion about the probability that TDCJ could control Appellant\n\nbecause Vigen had reviewed very little information about the case, had not been present\n\nthroughout the entire trial, and had not interviewed Appellant. Appellant countered that\n\nthe State’s argument concerned the weight to be given to Vigen’s opinion, rather than\n\nVigen’s qualifications to render it. The trial judge ruled Vigen’s testimony was\n\ninadmissible. After recessing to review Kelly, the trial judge also excluded Sorensen’s\n\ntestimony.\n\n       Rule 702 governs the admission of expert testimony. Tillman v.

Alternatively, Appellant asserts that the trial court should have permitted Vigen to\n\ntestify through answers to hypotheticals that Appellant would not be a future danger in\n\nprison.\n\n          To the extent Vigen proposed to testify about the probability that TDCJ could\n\ncontrol Appellant, the trial court’s ruling fell within the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\nThe record does not support Appellant’s assertion that Vigen based his opinion on any\n\ninformation specific to Appellant. At the admissibility hearing, the State asked Vigen\n\nrepeatedly about the bases for his opinion, and Vigen responded by listing his own\n\nexperience, articles that were not specific to Appellant, and Turner’s and Woods’s\n\ntestimony before the jury. Vigen did not include his review of Appellant’s prison record\n\nand offense reports related to Appellant’s aggravated-sexual-assault conviction as a basis\n\nfor his opinions. Further, neither Turner nor Woods offered testimony specific to\n\nAppellant. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it precluded Vigen from\n\ntestifying about the probability that TDCJ could control Appellant.\n\n          To the extent Appellant argues that the trial court should have allowed Vigen to\n\ntestify via hypotheticals that Appellant would not be a future danger in prison, the record\n\ndoes not show that Appellant suggested this alternative to the trial court. In responding to\n\f                                                                                     Cade–36\n\nthe State’s objection to Vigen’s proposed testimony, defense counsel argued:\n\n       Many times mental health professionals are given hypotheticals and asked\n       to render opinions about future dangerousness and [sic] certainly qualifies\n       within that category and meets the test of [Nenno] on the soft sciences that\n       he’s qualified to give an expert opinion. Any objection would go to the\n       weight. There’s no question about his qualifications and he’s been qualified\n       to testify in other death penalty cases [sic] the same or similar type of\n       issues.\n\nAlthough counsel mentioned the word “hypotheticals,” it was in the context of an\n\nargument that the trial court should allow Vigen to testify that TDCJ would be able to\n\ncontrol Appellant. The trial court cannot be fairly expected to have known from counsel’s\n\nargument that, if the trial court did not allow Vigen to testify about TDCJ’s ability to\n\ncontrol Appellant, then Appellant wished to put Vigen on the stand to testify about\n\nAppellant’s future dangerousness via hypotheticals. And when the trial court ruled that\n\nVigen’s testimony was inadmissible, Appellant did not seek clarification of the ruling’s\n\nscope. To the extent he would have otherwise presented Vigen’s testimony in the form of\n\nhypotheticals, Appellant failed to preserve any complaint. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1(a).\n\nPoint of error eight is overruled.\n\n       Sorensen proposed to offer an opinion based on the results of a novel and\n\nincomplete study that had not been peer-reviewed, published, or replicated. The trial court\n\nacted within its discretion when it found Sorensen’s testimony inadmissible under Rule\n\n702. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 277–80; Medrano, 127 S.W.3d at 784 n.4.

We decline the invitation in this case because, as discussed above, this Court is able to\nresolve both points of error without deciding the relevancy issue.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–38\n\n       Sabal’s complained-of testimony occurred during the State’s direct examination.\n\nSabal testified that, following Appellant’s termination from a mandatory sex-offender-\n\ntreatment program, an arrest warrant issued, and the district attorney filed a motion to\n\nrevoke Appellant’s community supervision. He also asserted that Appellant knew that the\n\ntermination endangered his community supervision and that Appellant acted “to extend\n\nhis stay in the community.” When the prosecutor asked Sabal to explain what she meant\n\nby that phrase, she answered,\n\n       When a sex offender is unsuccessfully discharged from treatment[,] then we\n       need to find another treatment provider that’s going to accept that defendant\n       into their program. That is not an easy thing to do once the offender has\n       been discharged from treatment, especially for the reasons [Appellant] was\n       discharged. . . . [I]t was difficult to find sex offender treatment providers\n       who would accept an offender who was discharged because [he was]\n       denying the offense for which [he] was placed on [community supervision]\n       and had failed a polygraph.\n\nThe defense objected, arguing that Sabal’s statement about the polygraph was irrelevant\n\nand highly prejudicial. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to\n\ndisregard the statement, but it denied Appellant’s subsequent request for a mistrial. The\n\nrecord reveals no further reference to the polygraph result by either party.\n\n       We review a trial court’s denial of a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion,\n\nand will uphold the ruling if it falls within the zone of reasonable disagreement. Coble,\n\n330 S.W.3d at 292. Here, the alleged grounds for mistrial arose from Sabal’s apparently\n\nunanticipated answer to the State’s question.

Robinson, 550 S.W.2d at 59\n\n(stating that the accomplice-witness’s testimony was vital to the State’s capital-murder\n\nprosecution); Nichols, 378 S.W.2d at 336 (noting that the State’s statutory-rape case\n\ndepended entirely on the 14-year-old complainant’s testimony). The prosecution did so in\n\nNichols by asking the victim if she had taken a polygraph and in Robinson by repeatedly\n\neliciting testimony that these witnesses had taken, and passed, polygraphs regarding their\n\naccounts of the charged offense. See Robinson, 550 S.W.2d at 56–59; Nichols, 378\n\nS.W.2d at 336–37. In Jones, the prosecution impeached the defendant’s punishment-\n\nphase testimony, in which she asserted that she killed the victim accidentally. Jones, 680\n\nS.W.2d at 500–01. It did so by obtaining the defendant’s admission on cross-examination\n\nthat she had taken a polygraph and lied in response to several questions. Id. at 502. The\n\nState also elicited testimony through another witness that the polygraph examiner\n\nbelieved the defendant had lied when she denied her part in the murder. Id. In Murray, an\n\nexperienced FBI agent who investigated the defendant for mail fraud testified at the guilt-\n\ninnocence phase of the defendant’s later trial on those charges. See Murray, 784 F.2d at\n\f                                                                                       Cade–41\n\n188. During his testimony, the agent referred to the fact that the defendant had taken a\n\npolygraph regarding the charged offense. Id. The panel majority found that the agent’s\n\nreference to the test was deliberate and that the trial court’s instruction to disregard the\n\ncomment was inadequate to cure the error. Id. at 188–89.\n\n       In Appellant’s case, the record does not support a finding that the prosecutor’s\n\nquestion was designed to elicit testimony concerning the polygraph or that the prosecutor\n\ncould have reasonably anticipated the reference. Further, the record shows that the\n\nprosecutor did not mention the polygraph or result after Sabal’s fleeting reference. In\n\naddition, Sabal’s reference occurred during the punishment phase, when the potential for\n\nprejudice was less than if it had occurred at the guilt-innocence phase. See Coble, 330\n\nS.W.3d at 293. Also, Sabal’s brief mention of the examination’s result concerned the\n\ncircumstances in which the convicting court revoked Appellant’s community supervision\n\nfor an extraneous offense. Sabal’s reference did not concern a polygraph in which\n\nAppellant or a witness submitted to questioning about the capital murder for which\n\nAppellant was then on trial. The record also does not support Appellant’s assertion that\n\nSabal’s reference to the polygraph and its result was the product of bad faith.\n\n       After review, we find no reasonable probability that Sabal’s objected-to testimony\n\ninterfered with the jury’s punishment verdict. The evidence supporting the jury’s answers\n\nto the punishment-phase special issues was substantial. Sabal’s reference to the\n\npolygraph’s result was brief, unsolicited, and concerned an extraneous matter; further, the\n\f                                                                                     Cade–42\n\nState did not attempt to capitalize upon the reference. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 293.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Appellant has not overcome the presumption that the trial\n\ncourt’s instruction to disregard was sufficient to cure any harm that may have otherwise\n\nresulted from the objectionable testimony. Point of error eleven is overruled.\n\n       In point of error twelve, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by allowing two\n\nof Desaree’s friends, Allison Nelson and Justus Rodgers, to give victim-impact testimony.\n\nAppellant asserts that their testimony was improper because the State did not elicit their\n\ntestimony in response to defense mitigation evidence and because close relatives were\n\navailable to provide victim-impact testimony. But Appellant has failed to preserve this\n\ncomplaint because his argument on appeal does not comport with his objection at trial.\n\nT EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1; Bekendam v.

App. 2014).\n\nAt trial, the sole basis for Appellant’s objection was that Nelson and Rodgers were not\n\nfamily members. The trial court overruled the objection, finding the testimony admissible\n\nunder Mosley v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1678386\"><a href=\"/opinion/1678386/mosley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (concluding that\n\nvictim-impact testimony is not rendered improper merely because the witness is not a\n\nfamily member). Point of error twelve is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirteen, Appellant contends that the trial court erred when it\n\ndeclined to include the following jury instructions in the punishment charge:\n\n       No juror has to agree with [any] other juror as to what is [a] mitigating\n       circumstance or set of circumstances that justifies a sentence of life. The\n       duty to deliberate only requires that each juror give careful consideration to\n       the evidence in the issue that you are to consider to give an individual true\n\f                                                                                       Cade–43\n\n       verdict according to the law and the evidence.\n\n       No juror is to be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture or sympathy for the\n       deceased or family of the deceased, nor are you to consider any prejudice or\n       public opinions or public feeling that may exist against [Appellant] in\n       considering an answer to Special Issue No. 2.\n\n       During your careful consideration of the special issues, each juror is entitled\n       to his or her own personal moral judgment as to the right answer for these\n       issues.\n\nAppellant asserts that the proposed instructions were all part of the law of capital\n\njurisprudence and were necessary to guide the jury so that it would apply the death\n\npenalty in a constitutional manner.\n\n       Appellant’s argument lacks merit. Article 37.071, subsection (e), sets forth the law\n\napplicable to the mitigation special issue. The trial court’s charge tracked that statutory\n\nlanguage. See Martinez, 924 S.W.2d at 699 (“Following the law as it is set out by the\n\nTexas Legislature will not be deemed error on the part of the trial judge.”). Point of error\n\nthirteen is overruled.\n\n       In point of error fourteen, Appellant asserts that the trial court reversibly erred by\n\noverruling his objection to the State’s allegedly improper punishment-phase argument.\n\nAppellant contends that the State misstated the law by suggesting that the death penalty\n\nwould be a proper verdict based only on an affirmative answer to the future-\n\ndangerousness special question. He argues that Texas law “presumes that a life sentence\n\nis appropriate and a death sentence [inappropriate]” unless the jury answers the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue in the affirmative and the mitigation special issue in the\n\f                                                                                      Cade–44\n\nnegative.\n\n       The record shows that, after correctly stating the two special issues, the prosecutor\n\nlinked the evidence presented at trial to them. See Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1), 2(e)(1). The\n\nprosecutor first focused on the offense facts, arguing that the “horrific[,] senseless,\n\nunjustified violence” Appellant had inflicted was relevant to both special issues and\n\nshowed that Appellant was the type of person who “deserv[ed] a death\n\nsentence”—“exactly what Special Issue 1 and 2 are about.” She also drew the jury’s\n\nattention to the evidence of Appellant’s extraneous offenses and other bad acts, arguing\n\nthat they constituted additional reasons for the jury to return an affirmative answer to the\n\nfuture-dangerousness special issue. After asking the jury to return an affirmative answer\n\non future dangerousness, the prosecutor segued into her argument concerning the\n\nmitigation issue:\n\n              The answer to Special Issue No. 1 is yes. What the State of Texas\n       asks [is] that you vote that way, all of you, and you move on to Special\n       Issue No. 2.\n\n              Now on this special issue, we don’t have the burden of proof, [and]\n       neither does the defense. It’s left up to you. And [Special Issue No. 2] really\n       asks you is there anything that is sufficiently mitigating to warrant that he\n       shouldn’t have the death sentence that you’ve already determined that he\n       deserves by the answer of yes to Special Issue No. 1.\n\n       Appellant objected to the last sentence of the passage set forth above, arguing that it\n\nmisstated the law because “the death sentence is not imposed until all questions are\n\nanswered.” The trial court overruled the objection.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–45\n\n       We perceive no misstatement of law. The prosecutor did not argue that Appellant\n\ncould lawfully receive a death sentence based only on an affirmative answer to the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue. The State’s argument was reasonably understood as a\n\nhypothetical, in which it posited that the jury had already answered “yes” to the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue and was beginning to deliberate on the mitigation issue. Once\n\nthe jury has made an affirmative finding concerning future dangerousness, a defendant’s\n\nsentence is presumptively death unless, after considering the mitigating evidence presented\n\nto it, the jury also answers the mitigation special issue in the affirmative or deadlocks on\n\nthat issue. See Art. 37.071, § 2(g). Point of error fourteen is overruled.\n\n                              VI. V OIR DIRE—B ATSON CHALLENGES\n\n       In points of error fifteen and sixteen, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his Batson12 challenges to the State’s use of peremptory strikes against African-\n\nAmerican veniremembers Viola Brimmer and Leamon Parker. Appellant, who is African-\n\nAmerican, contends that racial discrimination motivated the strikes.\n\n       In Batson, the United States Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause\n\nforbids a prosecutor from exercising peremptory strikes based solely on the basis of a\n\npotential juror’s race.

Crim. App. 2009).\n\n       The record shows that Brimmer’s individual voir dire took place before Judge Quay\n\nParker.13 Lead prosecutor Heath Harris questioned Brimmer for the State. At the\n\nconclusion of Brimmer’s voir dire, the State exercised the first of its fifteen statutorily\n\ngranted peremptory strikes to remove her from jury service. See Art. 35.15(a). Defense\n\ncounsel responded with a preemptive Batson challenge, noting Brimmer’s race and gender,\n\nand that the State had used its first peremptory strike against a person of a minority race.\n\nHarris and two other members of the prosecution team who were present during\n\nBrimmer’s voir dire—Jason Hermus and Rachel Jones—made a contemporaneous record\n\nof their race-neutral reasons for striking Brimmer.\n\n       13\n        Judge Mark Stoltz presided over Appellant’s trial. In addition to Judge Parker, Judges\nJoseph Clayton, Webb Biard, and Jim Fry assisted Judge Stoltz with individual voir dire.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–47\n\n       Harris stated that he was concerned that Brimmer would demand that the State meet\n\na higher standard of proof than the law required. Harris asserted that Brimmer’s juror-\n\nquestionnaire responses and individual voir dire testimony manifested Brimmer’s belief\n\nthat the death penalty had been applied disproportionately to African-Americans in Texas,\n\ngenerally, and in Dallas County, specifically. Harris also noted that, in her questionnaire\n\nresponses, Brimmer had expressed a clear preference for life without the possibility of\n\nparole over a death sentence. Harris said that Brimmer’s sentencing preference also\n\nmanifested itself during her voir dire through Brimmer’s reluctance to say that she could\n\nanswer the special issues according to the evidence, if doing so would result in a death\n\nsentence:\n\n       And when I asked her on numerous occasions, numerous time after time\n       [sic] trying to get her to commit that if we prove [Appellant guilty of capital\n       murder] and if Special Issue One was answered yes and Special Issue Two\n       was answered no, if she could render a death sentence, she was very, very\n       reluctant in answering. I almost at one point had to move on because I\n       couldn’t get her to say that she would do death over life.\n\n       And I just think that it’s clear from [Brimmer’s voir dire] that there seemed\n       to be a huge reluctance on her part to ever really consider a death sentence\n       versus a life sentence without the possibility of parole, which is what she\n       indicated not only on her questionnaire but also here today. And that’s the\n       primary reason I struck her.\n\n       Hermus stated that he and Jones concurred with Harris on all the reasons Harris had\n\nexpressed to the court. Hermus then gave his additional reasons for striking Brimmer.\n\nHermus stated that he had concerns with Brimmer before her individual voir dire, based on\n\nthe equivocating nature of many of her juror-questionnaire answers, and he offered a\n\f                                                                                     Cade–48\n\nnonexhaustive list of examples: (1) Brimmer was not sure whether she favored the death\n\npenalty, (2) Brimmer wrote “none at this time” when asked to provide the best argument\n\nfor the death penalty, and (3) Brimmer thought conviction of multiple murders was\n\n“possibly” a proper basis for death eligibility. Hermus asserted that Brimmer’s live\n\ntestimony often reflected a similar equivocation. He noted that Brimmer often rephrased\n\nHarris’s questions into what she apparently wanted the question to be, rather than what\n\nHarris had asked.\n\n       Hermus stated that Brimmer’s demeanor during the State’s voir dire also troubled\n\nhim. He observed Brimmer make faces at Harris or grimace on four different occasions\n\nwhen Harris tried to elicit her opinion on the death penalty and ability to impose it.\n\nHermus believed that Brimmer’s facial expressions and accompanying verbal responses\n\nindicated either displeasure with or disdain toward Harris. Alternatively, Hermus believed\n\nthat Brimmer’s expressions and responses reflected her reluctance to answer the special\n\nissues according to the evidence if a death sentence would result. Hermus also noted that\n\nBrimmer said that she had an issue with African-Americans being “railroaded” onto Death\n\nRow. Lastly, Hermus mentioned that Brimmer’s “reluctance initially to [sic] circumstantial\n\nevidence” concerned the prosecution team.\n\n       Jones added that she was also troubled by Brimmer’s hesitation and facial\n\nexpression when Harris asked whether Brimmer could convict someone on the testimony\n\nof one witness, if the witness could testify to every element of the offense and Brimmer\n\f                                                                                    Cade–49\n\nbelieved the witness. Jones asserted that Brimmer’s facial expression and response\n\nindicated disbelief that the State could obtain a conviction for capital murder based on the\n\ntestimony of only one witness. Jones acknowledged that Brimmer qualified her initial\n\nresponse, but Jones asserted that Brimmer’s qualification was also problematic because it\n\nsuggested that Brimmer would require eyewitness testimony:\n\n       [W]hen we talked to her about proving our case with one witness and if she\n       believed that witness, she proceeded to go on -- she had some hesitation\n       about that and, again, her facial expression, saying, how could you only\n       have one witness?\n\n       And then she qualified it by saying, oh, well, if that one witness saw him\n       commit the crime, and managed to get out, before they too were stabbed,\n       well, then okay, then I could do it.\n\n       Jones also cited Brimmer’s responses when Harris discussed the State’s burden of\n\nproof and tried to determine whether Brimmer would increase that burden. Jones asserted\n\nthat Brimmer’s answers were equivocal or uninformative, because Brimmer would\n\nessentially say no more than, “I just expect you to prove it. I would expect you to prove it.”\n\nJones also stated that towards the end of the State’s voir dire, Brimmer expressed the\n\nsentiment that, in her heart, she did not believe in the death penalty.\n\n       After the prosecutors gave their reasons for striking Brimmer, defense counsel\n\nstated that he would reserve questions because the Batson challenge was premature at that\n\nstage of voir dire. Judge Parker agreed that the challenge was premature and denied it,\n\nstating that Appellant could reurge it at a later time.\n\n       A week later, venire member Parker’s individual voir dire took place before Judge\n\f                                                                                       Cade–50\n\nClayton. Harris questioned Parker for the State. At the conclusion of defense counsel’s\n\nvoir dire, prosecutor Jones challenged Parker for cause on two grounds. See Art. 35.16.\n\nFirst, Jones asserted that, although his answers on the issue vacillated somewhat, Parker’s\n\nfinal answer during the State’s voir dire was that the prosecution would have to prove its\n\ncase to a degree that left no doubt in his mind. Jones argued that Parker was, therefore,\n\nrequiring 100% proof from the State—more than proof beyond a reasonable doubt—which\n\nmade him challengeable for cause under Narvaiz v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1659315\"><a href=\"/opinion/1659315/narvaiz-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1992). Second, Jones argued that Parker did not consider circumstantial\n\nevidence to be valid and could not return a guilty verdict based solely on circumstantial\n\nevidence. When these challenges for cause were unsuccessful, Hermus lodged two\n\nadditional challenges for cause based on Parker’s opposition to the death penalty as\n\nexpressed in his juror questionnaire responses and voir dire testimony. Judge Clayton also\n\ndenied the State’s additional challenges for cause.\n\n       The next day, the State used its second peremptory strike to remove Parker from the\n\nvenire. Hermus asked to place the State’s reasons for the strike on the record, in case of a\n\nlater Batson challenge. Hermus stated that the State struck Parker based on his\n\nquestionnaire answers and voir dire testimony. Hermus particularly drew the court’s\n\nattention to Parker’s answers to the following questions:\n\n       •      (Q. 1) Parker indicated that he was not in favor of the death penalty\n              and wrote, “Only God should make that decision.”\n\n       •      (Q. 2) Parker indicated that he did not believe that the death penalty\n\f                                                                             Cade–51\n\n    should ever be imposed, but if the law provided for it, he could\n    assess it under the proper circumstances.\n\n•   (Q. 4–5) Parker asserted that he had moral, religious, or personal\n    beliefs that would prevent him from sitting in judgment of another\n    human being or returning a verdict that would result in another’s\n    execution. In explanation, Parker wrote that “[t]he Bible tells us not\n    to judge others” and returning a verdict that would result in a death\n    sentence “mean[t] I [was] judging another and could cost them their\n    life.”\n\n•   (Q. 7) Parker wrote “none” when asked to provide the best argument\n    for the death penalty.\n\n•   (Q. 8) Parker wrote that “God[’]s word” was the best argument\n    against the death penalty.\n\n•   (Q. 10) Parker disagreed with Texas law to the extent it makes\n    multiple-murder a capital offense.\n\n•   (Q. 11) Parker disagreed that some crimes warrant the death penalty\n    solely because of their severe facts and circumstances, regardless of\n    whether the guilty person has committed prior violent acts. Parker\n    wrote, “If you kill the[n] you are no better than they are.”\n\n•   (Q. 12) Parker disagreed with Texas law to the extent it permits\n    conviction of a crime, including capital murder, based solely on\n    circumstantial evidence, with no eyewitnesses. Parker wrote, “That is\n    not beyond a reasonable doubt to me.”\n\n•   (Q. 14) Parker indicated that he did not believe in an eye for an eye,\n    writing that “God said turn the other cheek.”\n\n•   (Q. 18) Parker indicated that he did not believe that Texas applies the\n    death penalty fairly. Parker wrote, “By statistic[s,] black men are\n    given the death penalty more than whites, therefore I feel it is\n    unfair.”\n\n•   (Q. 20) When asked whether he believed the death penalty is used\n    too often or too seldom, Parker wrote, “Too often, one is too many.”\n\f                                                                                      Cade–52\n\n\n         •     (Q. 130) Parker indicated that he would not want to serve as a juror\n               in Appellant’s case, writing, “Because of the death penalty.”\n\nHermus stated that Parker’s responses to the foregoing questionnaire items reflected a\n\nstrong bias against the death penalty, and Hermus did not believe that Parker could set it\n\naside.\n\n         Based on Parker’s questionnaire responses and voir dire testimony, Jones echoed\n\nHermus’s belief that, despite Parker’s best efforts, he would not be able to overcome his\n\nscruples against the death penalty. Jones added that they were also concerned by the\n\nhesitation and reservations that Parker expressed about circumstantial evidence, as well as\n\nthe burden of proof he would impose on the State,\n\n         And then we asked him, [e]ven if you believe the circumstantial evidence,\n         could you find somebody guilty, he vacillated on that. He said, [t]o me,\n         circumstantial evidence is no proof that there’s a case, and that he would\n         always be concerned that it was somebody else that did it without an\n         eyewitness. . . . [T]here could have been . . . other people involved that\n         would lead to this person being innocent, and that he would want us to\n         prove the case to him to where he would have no doubt in his mind, which\n         is why the State submitted him for a challenge for cause on requiring 100\n         percent proof. He further said that circumstantial evidence, he considers\n         that weak evidence.\n\nJudge Clayton overruled Appellant’s Batson challenge as to Parker, with leave to reurge\n\nthe challenge later in voir dire.\n\n         When the Batson hearing occurred, about halfway through voir dire, the State had\n\nused a total of four strikes, exercising its third and fourth peremptory challenges to remove\n\ntwo white veniremembers, including Linda Schultz. Judge Stoltz presided over the Batson\n\f                                                                                      Cade–53\n\nhearing, assisted by Judge Clayton, who had conducted Parker’s individual voir dire.\n\nAttempting to show that the State’s race-neutral explanations for striking Brimmer and\n\nParker were pretextual, defense counsel asserted that Brimmer, Parker, and a white venire\n\nmember, John Nily, had each indicated on their questionnaires that they “had problems”\n\nwith circumstantial evidence. Defense counsel asserted that the State had questioned Nily\n\ndifferently about the subject by giving him a more full explanation of what such evidence\n\nincludes. Defense counsel examined prosecutors Harris (who had questioned Brimmer and\n\nParker) and Jones (who had questioned Nily), asking them to explain the alleged disparity.\n\n       Harris testified that the general explanation of circumstantial evidence he gave to\n\nveniremembers varied, depending on different factors. Harris stated that the key difference\n\nbetween Brimmer, Parker, and Nily was that, although all three indicated on their\n\nquestionnaires that they had problems with circumstantial evidence, Nily specifically\n\nindicated that he favored the death penalty. In contrast, Parker voiced strong opposition to\n\nthe death penalty and Brimmer indicated uncertainty about the death penalty and a\n\npreference for life without the possibility of parole. Harris testified that the State’s main\n\nconcern with Parker was his very strong opposition to the death penalty. Harris said that\n\nParker’s attitudes toward circumstantial evidence also concerned the State but were\n\nsecondary to Parker’s stance on capital punishment. Harris testified that he tailored his\n\nquestioning of Parker accordingly. Harris also testified that he explained to Parker that\n\ncircumstantial evidence includes DNA and fingerprint evidence.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–54\n\n       Harris testified that Brimmer’s opposition to the death penalty was not as apparent\n\nfrom her questionnaire responses as Parker’s, but it became clear during voir dire that she\n\nstrongly favored life imprisonment without the possibility of parole over a death sentence.\n\nAs to defense counsel’s allegation that he did not explain the concept of circumstantial\n\nevidence to Brimmer, Harris noted that Brimmer was a trained paralegal and mediator who\n\nhad worked for several law firms. Harris testified that Brimmer was not an average juror\n\nand gave no sign of needing the concept explained to her. Moreover, when Harris\n\nexplained other aspects of death-penalty law, Brimmer’s demeanor suggested that she felt\n\ninsulted.\n\n       Harris testified that Brimmer’s legal background and current employment also\n\nfactored into the State’s decision to strike her. Harris stated that the prosecution team\n\nsubjected individuals with legal backgrounds to greater scrutiny due to concern that they\n\nwould be more opinionated and likely to influence other jurors during deliberations. Harris\n\nasserted that Brimmer’s job as an administrative officer for a Veteran’s Hospital was\n\nproblematic, because it potentially brought her into contact with people having mental-\n\nhealth complaints. Harris testified that similar concerns had caused the State to use its\n\nfourth peremptory strike against venire member Schultz, who was white and headed the\n\nspecial-education department for a local high school.\n\n       Defense counsel questioned Jones about her description, during Nily’s voir dire, of\n\ncircumstantial evidence as “almost a trick question.” Jones denied that, by using the term\n\f                                                                                      Cade–55\n\n“trick question,” she had meant that either party had designed questions to trick potential\n\njurors. Jones explained that she used that phrase merely to reassure Nily. Jones stated that\n\nNily had seemed a little intimidated by the process, based on his demeanor on the stand\n\nand statements that he had never been to court or involved in jury selection. When she\n\nasked him about circumstantial evidence, Jones explained:\n\n       [Nily] seemed maybe ashamed . . . when I said, do you know that\n       circumstantial evidence includes things like DNA and fingerprints? [T]he\n       record can’t fully reflect it, but he did one of these like no, just kind of\n       backing away, looking around at everybody.\n\n       And, so, I wanted to reassure him that there was nothing wrong with it, that\n       it is somewhat of a trick question, and I think -- We don’t explain that DNA\n       and fingerprints are circumstantial evidence. Most people don’t think about\n       it in those terms, and that was exactly how it was with him.\n\nDefense counsel asked Jones why the State did not provide the same explanation to\n\nBrimmer and Parker. Jones responded that Harris had given Parker substantially the same\n\nexplanation and that Brimmer did not seem to need an explanation. Jones further testified\n\nthat the State’s main concern during voir dire was always the venire member’s attitudes\n\nabout capital punishment. Jones asserted that Brimmer and Parker held fundamentally\n\ndifferent views from Nily. Jones explained that Brimmer said that she would keep the\n\ndeath penalty if she were governor of Texas, but also stated that, in her heart of hearts, she\n\nbelieved in life imprisonment without the possibility of parole rather than death. Jones\n\nstated that Parker did not believe in the death penalty, but asserted that he was willing to\n\nperform his civic duty, even at the risk of violating his conscience. Jones asserted that\n\f                                                                                    Cade–56\n\nNily, in contrast, testified that he had always believed in the death penalty and would\n\nexpand death eligibility to rapists and repeat child abusers.\n\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Stoltz stated that he had reviewed the\n\ntranscripts of Brimmer’s, Parker’s, and Nily’s individual voir dire. He denied Appellant’s\n\nBatson challenges to Brimmer and Parker, finding that the State’s facially race-neutral\n\nreasons for striking them Brimmer and Parker were genuine and reasonable.\n\n       After twelve jurors had been seated, the defense reurged its Batson challenges to\n\nJudge Stoltz. Defense counsel asserted that, before the Batson hearing, the prosecution\n\nteam had questioned African-American veniremembers differently than they had\n\nquestioned other potential jurors. Counsel argued that, following the Batson hearing, the\n\nprosecutors began to question African-American veniremembers in a way that was more\n\nconsistent with how they questioned other jurors. Counsel averred that the alleged change\n\nsupported the defense’s argument that race motivated the State’s strikes against Brimmer\n\nand Parker. Defense counsel noted that, following the Batson hearing, the parties had\n\naccepted James Brown, an African-American male, as a juror. Counsel offered the\n\ntranscript of Brown’s individual voir dire as an exhibit to support his reurged Batson\n\nchallenges.\n\n       Jones, who had questioned Brown for the State, responded that the State’s\n\nquestioning during individual voir dire was\n\n       a fluid proposition . . . based on the questionnaire. It depends on how the\n       juror answers the questions, it depends on the style of the prosecutor who is\n\f                                                                                        Cade–57\n\n       doing that individual questioning. So yes, some of the questions may\n       change, some may be more in-depth depending on what answer the juror\n       gives, and certainly, as we pointed out before, it all starts with how and\n       whether or not that person believes in the death penalty.\n\n       Mr. Brown has always believed in the death penalty, he talked about that in\n       his questionnaire, talked about that in individual voir dire.\n\n       Mr. Parker on his questionnaire said he did not believe in the death penalty\n       and never has, thereby marking a three [on Question 2]. [Brimmer] marked\n       a two on [Question 2 of] her questionnaire. However, one of the first things\n       she said in voir dire [was] that she did not favor the death penalty or believe\n       in it.\n\nJones asserted “absolutely” that any change in the State’s questioning was due to the way\n\nthe veniremembers answered the questionnaire, rather than the color of their skin. Jones\n\nalso noted that, besides accepting Brown as a juror, the State also accepted Betty Pettway,\n\nRosetta Johnlouis, and Diane Tyler, all of whom were African-American. Jones stated that\n\nPettway was seated as juror, while the defense used peremptory challenges against\n\nJohnlouis and Tyler. After reviewing Brown’s questionnaire and the transcript of his\n\nindividual voir dire, Judge Stoltz again denied Appellant’s Batson challenges.\n\n       After reviewing the entire record of voir dire, we conclude that Appellant is not\n\nentitled to relief. Initially, we note that the State exercised only seven of its fifteen\n\navailable peremptory strikes, using only two of those seven against African-American\n\njurors. It used the other five against white veniremembers. The State also accepted four\n\nAfrican-American veniremembers as jurors, and ultimately two of those individuals served\n\non Appellant’s jury. Further, the record amply supports the race-neutral explanations that\n\f                                                                                        Cade–58\n\nthe prosecution team offered at the time of the strikes, the Batson hearing, and when\n\nAppellant reurged his Batson challenges after twelve jurors had been seated.

The trial court denied Appellant’s challenge\n\nfor cause to Adair, as well as Appellant’s request for a third additional strike. Appellant\n\nasserted that, as a result of the trial court’s refusal to grant an eighteenth peremptory strike,\n\nhe had been forced to accept an objectionable juror, Adair.17 Because Appellant received\n\ntwo additional peremptory strikes, he can only demonstrate harm by showing that the trial\n\ncourt erroneously denied at least three of his challenges for cause.

Lumpkins\n\n       When defense counsel asked Lumpkins to explain his feelings about the insanity\n\ndefense, he answered: “I think -- I think it would have to be very strong, compelling\n\f                                                                                    Cade–61\n\nevidence, but it’s not something I reject out of hand.” Defense counsel argued that this\n\nstatement showed that Lumpkins would require Appellant to prove insanity by a\n\ncompelling-evidence standard, rather than a preponderance. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE\n\n§ 8.01(a).\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s challenge for\n\ncause on this basis. Lumpkins’s statement did not necessarily indicate that he would\n\nrequire Appellant to prove insanity by more than a preponderance standard. Further, the\n\nremainder of the exchange between Lumpkins and defense counsel suggested that\n\nLumpkins did not see “compelling” evidence as something that was inconsistent with a\n\npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard. After Lumpkins used the phrase “compelling\n\nevidence” and stated that he would not automatically reject an insanity defense, defense\n\ncounsel continued to question him as follows:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Yes. We just can’t -- We can’t be flippant about it. As you’ve\n       indicated in your answers before, I assume you mean that, you know, you\n       want something of substance.\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: Yeah, it can’t be because that’s the only recourse.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Right. Okay. And I think society, especially as recognized in\n       this state and other states, as a society, we don’t want to punish people who\n       do not know, because of some mental disease or defect, that they don’t\n       know the difference between right and wrong. Is that a fair statement?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: Uh-huh.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. And in that same vein, can you see that there are some\n       circumstances in which people actually physically go through acts that\n       cause people to die, or cause things to happen that are criminal offenses,\n\f                                                                                    Cade–62\n\n       and that they don’t know what they are doing because of some mental\n       disease or defect?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: I agree it’s possible.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: It’s possible. Okay. And that we have to sometimes look at all\n       the circumstances surrounding an event and possibly rely on other people\n       who study, make a profession of studying the mind; is that a fair statement?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: It’s why I said it’s compelling.\n\n       In addition, during earlier questioning by the State, Lumpkins evinced his\n\nunderstanding of Appellant’s burden of proof regarding the insanity defense and\n\nunequivocally stated that he would apply it if selected to serve. After informing Lumpkins\n\nthat Appellant might assert an insanity defense, the prosecutor discussed the concept of\n\nlegal insanity and explained Appellant’s preponderance burden of proof. The prosecutor\n\nthen probed Lumpkins’s ability to follow the law, if Appellant raised an insanity defense:\n\n       [PROSECUTION]: [I]f [insanity] were the defense, could you really use\n       your best judgment in determining whether or not the insanity is bona fide\n       or bunk?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: Well, that would depend on the preponderance of the\n       evidence to support it.\n\n       [PROSECUTION]: Sure.\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: In that event, yes.\n\nAfter discussing other topics related to the insanity determination, the prosecutor returned\n\nto Appellant’s preponderance burden of proof:\n\n       [PROSECUTION]: If you find the defendant not guilty, he goes home.\n       Okay? And when I talked to you earlier about insanity, the way insanity\n\f                                                                                      Cade–63\n\n       works is that, if you do believe [by] a preponderance of the evidence [that]\n       the defendant did not know that what he was doing was wrong at the time\n       of the commission of the offense, you have to find him not guilty by reason\n       of insanity. That’s what your oath is going to require you to do. If you\n       believe that, will you do it?\n\n       [LUMPKINS]: Yes.\n\n       Lumpkins’s entire voir dire contains sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s\n\nruling. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Thus, Appellant has not demonstrated that the trial court\n\nerred in overruling his challenge for cause to Lumpkins. Point of error eighteen is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                           B. Askins\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Askins would require a higher burden of proof than the\n\nlaw required on the issue of insanity. The record of his individual voir dire shows that\n\nAskins vacillated about his ability to apply the preponderance standard, should Appellant\n\nhave raised an insanity defense.\n\n       When questioned by the State, Askins asserted that he could find Appellant not\n\nguilty by reason of insanity if Appellant raised that defense at trial and proved it by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. When defense counsel asked Askins whether he had any\n\nproblems with the idea of an insanity defense, the venire member retreated from his\n\noriginal position:\n\n       [ASKINS]: You know, it’s hard for me to consider. I mean obviously there\n       are always circumstances that can bring that into play. But, honestly, it is\n       hard for me to consider the insanity defense, so I mean.\n\f                                                                                   Cade–64\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Would you, since our burden of proof is not to the level of\n       beyond a reasonable doubt on insanity, it’s by a preponderance which is just\n       kind of like more likely than not, like a -- If you’re using percentages, it\n       would be like 50.001 percent that we have to get to. Would you require the\n       defense to have a higher burden of proof in the insanity issue because it\n       would be so hard for you to consider?\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yeah.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: You would?\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yeah, I would.\n\nDefense counsel then requested a recess and challenged Askins for cause. The trial court\n\ndenied the challenge and after recalling Askins to the stand, addressed him directly:\n\n       [COURT]: Mr. Askins, the burden on the defense on the issue of insanity,\n       it’s their burden, it’s by a preponderance of the evidence. The legal\n       definition of preponderance of the evidence is the greater weight of the\n       credible and believable evidence. That’s their burden.\n\n       [ASKINS]: Okay.\n\n       [COURT]: Can you accept that burden?\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yes.\n\n       [COURT]: Okay. Would you apply that burden --\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yes.\n\n       [COURT]: -- in answering the issue on insanity?\n\n       [ASKINS]: Yes.\n\nAfter the trial court asked Askins to step outside, defense counsel renewed the challenge.\n\nThe trial court again denied it.\n\f                                                                                    Cade–65\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion. To the extent Askins vacillated about his\n\nability to apply a preponderance standard to Appellant’s insanity defense, the trial judge\n\nwas in the best position to determine whether the venire member would set aside his views\n\nand honestly and truthfully follow the juror’s oath. Burks, 876 S.W.2d at 893. In his final\n\nstatement on the issue, Askins asserted that he could, and would, follow the law. The trial\n\njudge was entitled to believe him, and we defer to that belief. See Gonzales v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2540288\"><a href=\"/opinion/2540288/gonzales-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836 n.7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). Point of error twenty-one is overruled.\n\n                                       C. Hernandez\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Hernandez could not follow the law regarding the\n\ninsanity defense and would elevate the defense’s burden of proof. The record shows that,\n\nunder questioning by the State, Hernandez unequivocally stated that she could and would\n\napply the preponderance standard if Appellant raised an insanity defense and would acquit\n\nhim if he satisfied that standard. When questioned by defense counsel, Hernandez again\n\nagreed that Appellant’s burden of proof regarding the insanity issue was a preponderance\n\nstandard. However, in response to a follow-up question, Hernandez manifested some\n\nconfusion about the possible evidentiary burdens and the differences between them:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Well, let me ask it to you this way. Is [preponderance] going\n       to be the same burden as like clear and convincing evidence or by proof\n       beyond a reasonable doubt to you?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: Beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Well, you shook your head and you said proof beyond a\n       reasonable doubt, so I didn’t understand what that meant to you.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–66\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: It’s beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. So you’re saying that a preponderance of the evidence\n       is going to have to be proven to you beyond a reasonable doubt?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: Yes.\n\n       Defense counsel clarified that preponderance of the evidence was an evidentiary\n\nstandard of its own and explained where it stood in relation to the clear-and-convincing\n\nand reasonable-doubt evidentiary burdens. After stating that the law required Appellant to\n\nprove insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, counsel returned to his original\n\nquestion:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: [O]kay, would you be able to hold us to that burden, or do you\n       think it’s going to take more like clear and convincing evidence or proof\n       beyond a reasonable doubt?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: I could hold you to that burden.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: You could -- I’m sorry?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: I could do that by a preponderance.\n\n       Defense counsel then asked Hernandez for her thoughts on psychiatrists and\n\npsychologists. When Hernandez responded, “There needs to be more like evidence from\n\ndifferent doctors,” this exchange followed:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. So if we were to bring you one doctor and you believed\n       him, by a preponderance of the evidence, that our client was insane at the\n       time of the offense, is that going to be sufficient for you, or are you going to\n       need more than that?\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: I think I’ll need more than that.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–67\n\n      [DEFENSE]: So you’re going to -- And this is where we have to use the\n      terms biased and prejudiced.\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: That’s fine.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: To some degree, you’re going to have a bias against the\n      defense because you’re going to require, even if you believe that one doctor\n      by a preponderance of the evidence, you’re going to require more than that;\n      is that correct?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Yes, just to be on the safe side.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: And that was a yes; is that correct?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Yes, sir.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Okay. And as I’ve explained to you, you know, I’ve told you\n      in that situation you believe that expert, okay, and you believe him and you\n      believe that we’ve proven our case by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n             But what you’re telling me is, even though you believe that, and you\n      believe it by a preponderance of the evidence, you’re going to require more,\n      correct?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: He needs to gain my -- I need to be able to, you know, I\n      need to be able to trust him. You know, I need to see like what kind of\n      history that doctor has and all that.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Okay. Well, I’m telling you, okay, I’m telling you right now\n      that you believe him. Okay? And you believe him --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: So you’re telling me that I believe him.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Yeah, and I’m saying --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: would say I believe him.\n\n      Evidently uncertain whether Hernandez understood the hypothetical or dissatisfied\n\nwith her answer, defense counsel re-emphasized the assumptions he was asking Hernandez\n\f                                                                                     Cade–68\n\nto make, then continued,\n\n      [DEFENSE]: And you’ve indicated to me that, in that situation, you’re\n      going to require more than one doctor. Is that still --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Yes. If it’s possible, yes. But I mean if he already gained\n      my trust and has more -- the balance is more on this side, like it’s better.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Let me just -- The trust and everything, that’s something\n      that’s personal to you. Okay.\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Okay.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: All I can tell you is what the law says. And I’m now trying to\n      put you in a situation where, under the law, we’ve proven to you by a\n      preponderance of the evidence --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Yes.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: -- that he has proven that he was insane by the preponderance\n      of the evidence. Just that burden, okay?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Okay.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: And what you have indicated to me is that, given that\n      situation, you would have a bias against --\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Well, if it’s by law, then I need to follow the law.\n\n      After observing that it was everyone’s natural tendency to say that she could follow\n\nthe law, counsel posed the hypothetical to Hernandez again and asked what her verdict\n\nwould be. Hernandez responded that, “I always go with whatever the law says.” Counsel\n\ncontinued to press Hernandez:\n\n      [DEFENSE]: So you understand what I’m getting at here, okay?\n\n      [HERNANDEZ]: Uh-huh.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–69\n\n       [DEFENSE]: I’m telling you that we’ve proven to you by the\n       preponderance of the evidence --\n\n       [HERNANDEZ]: You’ve already proven it to me.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And I want to know, what would your verdict be in that\n       situation?\n\nWhen the prosecutor objected that the question had already been asked and answered, the\n\ntrial court stated, “He can ask it again. He can ask it for three more minutes. I’ve heard --\n\nI’ve heard what she said.” When defense counsel asked Hernandez for her answer, she\n\nstated, “If it’s already been proven, then yes, I’ll go with that.” Defense counsel concluded\n\nhis voir dire and immediately afterward challenged her for cause. The trial court denied the\n\nchallenge.\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion. Hernandez repeatedly stated that she\n\nwould hold Appellant to a preponderance standard regarding his insanity defense. To the\n\nextent that Hernandez’s answers sometimes suggested she would hold Appellant to a\n\nhigher burden, the record supports a finding that those responses were based on her\n\ntemporary misapprehension of the law or confusion over defense counsel’s hypotheticals.\n\nFurther, the trial judge was in the best position to evaluate Hernandez’s demeanor and\n\nresponses. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. We extend particular deference to the trial\n\njudge’s decision in these circumstances. See id. Point of error twenty-two is overruled.\n\n                         D. Morgan, Hilburn, Langdon, and O’Con\n\n       Defense counsel challenged Morgan, Hilburn, Langdon, and O’Con solely due to\n\f                                                                                         Cade–70\n\ncertain written responses they gave on the juror questionnaire, arguing that the answers\n\nshowed that these veniremembers would automatically vote for the death penalty. The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in overruling Appellant’s challenges for cause to these\n\nfour prospective jurors.\n\n       While a juror who would automatically vote for the death penalty can be\n\nchallengeable for cause once a proper basis is established, Appellant failed to establish the\n\nproper bases to challenge these veniremembers for cause. To establish those bases,\n\nAppellant had to show that “the veniremember[s] understood the requirements of the law\n\nand could not overcome [their] prejudice well enough to follow the law.” Gardner, 306\n\nS.W.3d at 295. The requirements of the law are explained during voir dire 18 and after the\n\nquestionnaire or juror card is answered.19 As a result, a veniremember cannot be\n\nsufficiently questioned regarding possible prejudice revealed in the questionnaire or during\n\nvoir dire without, at least, some minimum amount of interaction on the part of the\n\nveniremember during voir dire.\n\n\n\n\n       18\n          See, e.g., Cardenas v.

Kessels\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Kessels would automatically impose the death penalty\n\nif Appellant were convicted of capital murder. At trial, counsel alluded to a portion of\n\nKessels’s voir dire testimony, in which counsel paraphrased Kessels as “say[ing]\n\nsomething about that he would start out at a death penalty and that it would take a lot of\n\nthinking for him to get back to neutral.” The trial court denied Appellant’s challenge.\n\n       In support of his argument, Appellant directs us to a portion of Kessels’s voir dire\n\nby the State. The prosecutor had begun to discuss the future-dangerousness special issue.\n\nHe had explained that it was permissible for a juror to answer the future dangerousness\n\nissue “yes” based on the circumstances of the offense, if the juror believed that the\n\ncircumstances so warranted. However, the prosecutor had also emphasized that the juror’s\n\nanswer to the future dangerousness issue could not be automatic. Although Kessels\n\nanswered “yes” when the prosecutor asked whether he could follow the process, the\n\nprosecutor noted hesitation in Kessels’s response. Noting the unfamiliarity of the special\n\f                                                                                     Cade–72\nissues to most jurors, the prosecutor asked Kessels to explain. Kessels responded:\n\n       [KESSELS]: When you said that I have to not really be able to answer\n       question -- Special Issue 1 until you’ve had the burden of proving it.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay.\n\n       [KESSELS]: I really just have a general belief that if someone commits,\n       what you’re saying, a multiple murder, a multiple stabbing murder, that\n       there inherently may be something in them that’s going to make me answer\n       that yes.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay.\n\n       [KESSELS]: So that might be something that I would have to work on to\n       get a more neutral playing field before that started.\n\nAppellant based his challenge on these statements.\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s challenge for\n\ncause to Kessels. The record shows that Kessels made the complained-of statements\n\nbefore the law was fully explained to him. Following Kessels’s statements, the prosecutor\n\nagain noted jurors’ general unfamiliarity with capital-sentencing procedures and explained\n\nthe second special issue. The prosecutor then presented a hypothetical to help Kessels\n\nunderstand the special issues’ interaction and why jurors should not automatically answer\n\nthem a certain way, even when a capital-murder conviction involved multiple murders.\n\nThe prosecutor began by describing the bare facts of a hypothetical capital murder\n\ninvolving two victims—facts from which, without additional information, a jury might\n\nreasonably draw negative inferences concerning the special issues (i.e., that the death\n\npenalty should be assessed).\n\f                                                                                     Cade–73\n       But the prosecutor then gave Kessels various examples of evidence that might be\n\npresented only at the punishment phase and that might lead jurors to answer the special\n\nissues in a way that would result in a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\nAfterward, the prosecutor questioned Kessels as follows:\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: And can you see how not having heard all the evidence\n       [yet], the answer has to start out no on Special Issue 1 until we prove it\n       otherwise and until you’ve kept an open mind and heard all the evidence?\n\n              Does that make sense?\n\n       [KESSELS]: It does.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Does that clear up your hesitation?\n\n       [KESSELS]: Yes. Great explanation.\n\nKessels subsequently asserted that the procedure and rationale surrounding the special\n\nissues made sense to him, and that he had no hesitation about being able to participate in\n\nthe process and keep an open mind until he heard all the evidence.\n\n       The record contains sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s ruling.

If the venire member checked\n\n“yes,” the question directed the individual to provide the year and type of case, verdict,\n\npunishment amount, and whether the judge or the jury set punishment. Sturgeon checked\n\n“yes.” He wrote that, while he could not recall the year, he had been a juror in a criminal\n\ncase in which the jury had acquitted the defendant.\n\n       During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor asked Sturgeon about his jury service in\n\nthe case Sturgeon had listed in response to Question 45. Sturgeon described it as a\n\npedophilia case and stated that the trial lasted three or four days. When the prosecutor\n\nasked whether that was his first time serving on a jury, Sturgeon answered, “Something\n\nlike that. I mean, I served on a traffic violation jury in Garland.” Sturgeon subsequently\n\ntold the prosecutor that his service on the traffic violation case occurred “way before” his\n\nservice on the pedophilia case. When the defense questioned him, Sturgeon guessed that\n\nhe might have served on the pedophilia case in the late 1990s.\n\n       In challenging him for cause, defense counsel acknowledged that Sturgeon had\n\nlisted his jury service in the pedophilia case on the questionnaire, but noted that Sturgeon\n\nhad not included his service in the traffic case. Counsel argued that Sturgeon’s failure to\n\nlist his traffic-case service on the questionnaire reflected a lack of candor and suggested\n\nthat he would automatically vote for the death penalty.\n\n       Appellant’s reliance on Franklin is misplaced. Franklin concerned the standard of\n\f                                                                                       Cade–75\nharm an appellate court should apply when a trial judge erroneously denies a mistrial that\n\nthe defendant sought on the grounds that a juror withheld material information during voir\n\ndire. Id. at 355. In that context, we noted our previous holding that, “where a juror\n\nwithholds material information during the voir dire process,” the Sixth Amendment is\n\nimplicated because “the parties are denied the opportunity to exercise their challenges,\n\nthus hampering their selection of a disinterested and impartial jury.” Id. at 354 (citing\n\nSalazar v.

Both parties had\n\nan opportunity to question Sturgeon on the matter and make informed choices concerning\n\nthe exercise of their challenges. In addition, it was within the trial judge’s discretion to\n\ndetermine that the information was immaterial. See Franklin v.

Crim. App. 2000).\n\n       The record contains sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s ruling. The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s challenge for cause to Sturgeon\n\nbased on his alleged lack of candor on the juror questionnaire. Point of error twenty-six is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                         G. Johnlouis\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Johnlouis’s response to his hypothetical showed that\n\nshe would automatically assess the death penalty. Counsel also asserted that Johnlouis\n\f                                                                                      Cade–76\nwould elevate Appellant’s burden of proof regarding the insanity determination because\n\nshe would require him to present an expert in support of an insanity defense. We find no\n\nabuse of discretion because the record of Johnlouis’s voir dire supports the trial court’s\n\nruling.\n\n          During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor explained that Texas law provides two\n\nsentencing options for capital murder: (1) life without parole or (2) death. Johnlouis agreed\n\nthat she believed the death penalty was appropriate “in certain circumstances” but was\n\nopen to both sentencing options. After exploring topics primarily relevant to the guilt-\n\ninnocence determination, the prosecutor returned to the subject of punishment and\n\nJohnlouis’s ability to answer the special issues based on the law and evidence, even if it\n\nmeant that a death sentence would result. Johnlouis stated that she would be comfortable\n\nparticipating in a process that could result in a defendant receiving a death sentence, but\n\nJohnlouis repeatedly emphasized that her answers to the special issues would depend on\n\nthe evidence. Johnlouis also asserted that her answers to the special issues would not be\n\ndictated by the fact that the jury had found Appellant guilty of capital murder.\n\n          During Appellant’s voir dire, defense counsel presented Johnlouis with a\n\nhypothetical, asking her to assume that she sat on a jury that had just found a defendant\n\nguilty of capital murder. Counsel emphasized that by finding the defendant guilty, the jury\n\nhad necessarily determined that the defendant had “[k]nowingly and intentionally caused\n\nthe death of two people. All right. Meant to do it, intended to do it. It wasn’t a mistake. It\n\f                                                                                      Cade–77\nwasn’t an accident. The person wasn’t insane, okay?” Following that introduction, defense\n\ncounsel asked Johnlouis to tell him “what [her] thoughts are on the death penalty at that\n\npoint.” Johnlouis responded, “Again, I have to hear --” before being cut off by the\n\nprosecutor, who objected that defense counsel had asked an improper commitment\n\nquestion. After the court overruled the objection and defense counsel asked for Johnlouis’s\n\nanswer, she asked him to “[g]ive [her] the question . . . again. There’s so much going on.”\n\nCounsel repeated the hypothetical, again emphasizing what the jury had necessarily\n\ndetermined by finding the defendant guilty and asking for Johnlouis’s “thoughts . . . on the\n\ndeath penalty at that point.” Johnlouis answered, “The death penalty because he did it, you\n\nknow, and there was no -- he did it.”\n\n       Apparently believing that Johnlouis did not understand the issue or his question,\n\ndefense counsel explained the differences in the jury’s inquiry at the guilt-innocence phase\n\nversus the punishment phase of trial, focusing on the special issues. He then presented the\n\nhypothetical again:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And what were your thoughts on the death penalty at that\n       point?\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: And Special [Issue] Number 1 has been --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: No, I’m just saying -- that’s what I’m saying, you’re just at\n       the guilt/innocence portion, okay?\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: I’m just at the guilt/innocence?\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Yeah, you found the person guilty of capital murder.\n\f                                                                                     Cade–78\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Guilty? Okay.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Okay. So what would your thoughts be on the death penalty at\n      that point?\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Again, if they -- if he’s guilty or she’s guilty, then if\n      they’re imposing the death penalty, then they’ll impose the death penalty, I\n      guess.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: So your belief is that at that phase of the trial the person ought\n      to get the death penalty, is that your position?\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nDefense counsel then abandoned his hypothetical and proceeded to discuss Special Issue\n\nNumber 1:\n\n      [DEFENSE]: Okay. And so when you’re going through that special issue,\n      would you agree with me that you would have to be convinced beyond a\n      reasonable doubt that this defendant would commit criminal acts of\n      violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society, correct?\n\n             Would you agree with me on that?\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Again, I need to hear, you know, more than just he’s -- you\n      know, what he did. I mean what happened, you know, the circumstances of\n      what happened.\n\nJohnlouis continued:\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: I don’t think I would say that he would be a threat until I\n      can understand or hear, you know, some of the things that’s happening that\n      he did or whatever. I -- I can’t make that decision at this point.\n\n      [DEFENSE]: And I’m not asking you to make the decision. What I’m trying\n      to --\n\n      [JOHNLOUIS]: Would he be a threat? Until I get the evidence, I’m not\n      sure, you know. I have to weigh what’s going on with him, you know. I\n\f                                                                                     Cade–79\n       don’t -- and then try to put that into perspective. I’m not sure if he would be\n       a threat to society. I don’t, you know --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And that’s what I’m getting at.\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: Yeah.\n\n       The record supports a finding that Johnlouis was confused by counsel’s\n\nhypothetical, which asked for her “thoughts” on the death penalty rather than whether she\n\ncould follow the law, and that her answers resulted from that confusion. Johnlouis’s\n\nsubsequent statements regarding Special Issue Number 1, and her testimony during the\n\nState’s voir dire, manifested her understanding that, by law, a death sentence cannot be the\n\nautomatic consequence of a capital-murder conviction. They similarly manifested her\n\nwillingness to follow the law. In any event, the trial judge was in the best position to\n\ndetermine whether Johnlouis would set aside her personal views and honestly and\n\ntruthfully follow the juror’s oath. Burks, 876 S.W.2d at 893. We defer to his\n\ndetermination.\n\n       We next consider Appellant’s assertion that Johnlouis would elevate his burden of\n\nproof by requiring him to present an expert witness to support his insanity defense. When\n\ndefense counsel initially began discussing the insanity defense and the applicable burden\n\nof proof, he explained that the law did not require Appellant to present expert testimony,\n\nand that Appellant could prove his defense solely with lay testimony. Johnlouis stated that\n\nshe could find Appellant not guilty by reason of insanity based on the testimony of one\n\npsychologist, if she believed the testimony and it established legal insanity by a\n\f                                                                                   Cade–80\npreponderance of the evidence. Johnlouis also stated that she could find Appellant not\n\nguilty by reason of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, based on a lay witness’s\n\ntestimony and without expert testimony. But when defense counsel began to transition to\n\nanother topic, Johnlouis asked for clarification regarding the means by which Appellant\n\ncould prove legal insanity. Defense counsel explained again that Appellant could prove his\n\ndefense only with lay testimony, if he wished. Afterward, Johnlouis stated that she\n\nunderstood and had no problem with a lack of expert testimony.\n\n       Defense counsel later asked Johnlouis if she had any questions. Johnlouis expressed\n\nsome difficulty with the idea of Appellant proving insanity solely through lay testimony: “I\n\ndon’t quite agree -- I mean, understand, maybe. I don’t agree with the non-expert delivery.\n\nThat’s a problem with me, yeah.” She continued,\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: You know, I -- personally, I feel that you have to have\n       somebody -- I mean, a cousin or somebody --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay.\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: -- saying that they’re insane or whatever.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: So you’re saying that you would need an expert there?\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: I think I would probably want one, you know, just to, you\n       know, and run tests or whatever on the --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And -- and --\n\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: Yeah, because, you know, you can’t just have me --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And that’s –\n\f                                                                                        Cade–81\n       [JOHNLOUIS]: -- come up and say I’m crazy when I’m not.\n\nDefense counsel explained the law again and referred to Johnlouis’s earlier assertion that\n\nshe could find Appellant not guilty by reason of insanity if he proved it by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence through a lay witness. Counsel told Johnlouis that if her\n\nanswer had changed, then she needed to tell him. Johnlouis responded, “[I]f that’s what\n\nthe law says, then we have to follow the law, you know, so that’s why I said I could do it.\n\nBut just because the law -- not that I agree with it, but because of the law.” When counsel\n\ncontinued to press her on the point, Johnlouis stated, “Well, I -- I just said -- I don’t -- I\n\npersonally don’t agree with that but, you know, if that’s the law, that’s the law, you\n\nknow.” In further discussion, Johnlouis was emphatic about her ability to set aside her\n\npersonal disagreement and follow the law, now that she understood it.\n\n       To the extent that Johnlouis gave inconsistent or unclear statements, the trial court\n\nwas in the best position to determine whether she would set aside her personal views and\n\nhonestly and truthfully follow the juror’s oath. Id. We defer to its determination. Point of\n\nerror twenty-seven is overruled.\n\n                                            H. Tyler\n\n       Appellant argues that Tyler was challengeable because (1) she would require an\n\nexpert to testify in support of an insanity defense, and (2) she would impose a higher\n\nburden of proof than the law required regarding the insanity determination. The trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in overruling Appellant’s challenge for cause on these bases.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–82\n       During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor informed Tyler that Appellant might\n\nraise an insanity defense at trial. The prosecutor explained the definition of legal insanity,\n\nAppellant’s preponderance burden of proof, and that Appellant need not present expert\n\ntestimony or a certain number of witnesses. Tyler unequivocally stated that she could\n\nfollow the law in deciding whether Appellant was not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\n       The exchange that formed the basis of Appellant’s challenge to Tyler came at the\n\nend of the defense’s voir dire when defense counsel directed Tyler’s attention to Question\n\n38 of the juror questionnaire. Question 38 informed potential jurors that a person with\n\nmental illness can receive life without parole or the death penalty for capital murder and\n\nasked veniremembers what they thought. Tyler had written, “I don’t know about that[,]\n\nsometime[s] I think they [know] what they are doing.” When defense counsel asked Tyler\n\nwhat she meant by her answer, she explained,\n\n       [TYLER]: Sometimes people are mentally ill but they -- sometimes they be\n       in their right mind and I think sometimes they know what they be doing,\n       and then sometimes if they’re not on their medication, they don’t know.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Well, would you -- you’re -- I think that -- that -- let me ask\n       you, would you be able to listen to evidence about the insanity defense and\n       if you believed that [Appellant] . . . was insane at the time of the offense,\n       would you be able to say not guilty by reason of insanity?\n\n       [TYLER]: If you prove it to me.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: What kind of -- of proof would you be looking for in a -- in\n       an insanity defense, do you know?\n\n              Do you have any idea about that?\n\f                                                                                    Cade–83\n       [TYLER]: I think that you would have to have an expert witness to testify\n       or something to say that he’s insane, something showing that he wasn’t on\n       his medication at the time or if he’s on medication.\n\n              I mean, you have to prove to me that he was insane.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Would we have to prove that to you more than as it was\n       explained to you, more than [by] a preponderance of the evidence?\n\n       [TYLER]: I think so.\n\n       Defense counsel concluded his voir dire directly thereafter and challenged Tyler\n\nfor cause based on the exchange set forth immediately above. After hearing the parties’\n\narguments for and against the challenge, the trial court recalled Tyler to the stand and\n\nquestioned her directly:\n\n       [COURT]: [Y]ou understand that the law requires that they prove [insanity]\n       by a preponderance of the evidence, --\n\n       [TYLER]: Yes, right.\n\n       [COURT]: -- okay?\n\n              And you understand that’s the law.\n\n       [TYLER]: Right.\n\n       [COURT]: Now preponderance of the evidence is not as great a burden as\n       beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n              You understand that?\n\n       [TYLER]:      (Nods head.)\n\n       [COURT]: In fact, one of the attorneys said, you know, 50.1 percent to 49.9\n       percent, or whatever you want to -- just barely tipping the scale one way or\n       another.\n\f                                                                                    Cade–84\n       [TYLER]: Right.\n\n       [COURT]: That’s the burden of proof that the defense has to prove to\n       you . . . [that] the defendant’s insane -- [was] insane at the time of the\n       offense.\n\n             And when [the prosecutor] was talking to you, you said [y]es, you\n       understood that and you could.\n\n              And I think you gave [defense counsel] a different answer, in that\n       you said, well, you would require more of a burden of proof from the\n       defense than a preponderance of the evidence. I mean, [those weren’t] your\n       exact words, but that’s what you indicated.\n\n              Is that the way you feel?\n\n              Now that you know what the law is, can you follow the law or would\n       you require them [to meet] a higher burden of proof than the law imposes?\n\n       [TYLER]: No, I could follow the law. If he proved that to a certain degree\n       that --\n\n       [COURT]: By a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n       [TYLER]: Right. That he was insane at the time?\n\n       [COURT]: Yeah.\n\n       [TYLER]: I could go along with that.\n\n       [COURT]: Okay.\n\n       [TYLER]: I could follow the law.\n\nThe trial court thereafter denied the challenge for cause.\n\n       We find no abuse of discretion. To the extent Tyler gave contradictory answers\n\nconcerning her ability to apply a preponderance standard to Appellant’s insanity defense\n\f                                                                                       Cade–85\nand whether she would require Appellant to present expert testimony, the trial judge was\n\nin the best position to determine whether she would set aside her views and honestly and\n\ntruthfully follow the juror’s oath. Burks, 876 S.W.2d at 893. The trial judge was entitled\n\nto believe Tyler when she told him that she could and would follow the law; we defer to\n\nthat belief. See Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 836 n.7. Point of error twenty-eight is overruled.\n\n                                          I. Sowden\n\n       Appellant challenged Sowden on the grounds that she would automatically vote for\n\nthe death penalty and hold the defense to a higher burden of proof than the law required\n\non the issue of insanity. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Appellant’s\n\nchallenge to Sowden on these grounds.\n\n       Regarding the allegation that Sowden would automatically assess the death\n\npenalty, Appellant relies on a response she gave during the State’s voir dire. He asserts\n\nthat Sowden stated she would be “inclined” to assess the death penalty if a person were\n\nfound guilty of a capital murder involving the killings of two people. See T EX. P ENAL\n\nC ODE § 19.03(a)(7). Appellant acknowledges that Sowden went on to say that she would\n\nlisten to all the evidence, but he contends that her initial response reflected her true\n\nfeelings. We find no abuse of discretion, as the record supports the trial court’s ruling.\n\n       Before Sowden made the statement at issue, the prosecutor had begun to explain\n\nthe law concerning capital murder. Sowden stated that she had previously assumed that a\n\ncapital-murder conviction automatically meant a death sentence. After learning more\n\f                                                                                        Cade–86\nabout capital-sentencing procedures, however, Sowden denied believing that everyone\n\nconvicted of capital murder should automatically receive the death penalty, no matter\n\nwhat the punishment-phase evidence might show.\n\n       The prosecutor then asked Sowden to assume that she sat on a jury that had found\n\na defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of a capital murder involving the deaths of\n\ntwo people. The prosecutor emphasized that the jury had, therefore, necessarily found that\n\nthe killings were not accidental, but intentional. He asked Sowden, “And are you\n\nautomatically going to assess the death penalty or will you listen to the next phase of trial\n\nand honestly apply those questions and see where the answer takes you?” Sowden replied,\n\n“I might have some idea, but I will listen to the facts,” and, “That’s what will lead me.”\n\n       Appellant relies on Sowden’s statement, that she “might have some idea,” to\n\nsupport his argument that she would automatically assess the death penalty. But the\n\nprosecutor continued to question Sowden on this subject and obtained several definitive\n\nanswers that she would not automatically assess a death sentence. Sowden expressed her\n\nbelief in the integrity of the sentencing process and her willingness to maintain it,\n\nasserting that she could “listen to everything and then . . . make [her] decision on what\n\n[she] listened to.” When defense counsel asked Sowden what she had meant when she\n\ntold the prosecutor that she had “some idea,” Sowden responded, “Some idea -- what\n\nyou’re talking to me about is I have no facts yet on this case, so that’s when I say, I have\n\nan idea what I would do, but I cannot tell you until I have all the facts exactly what I will\n\f                                                                                        Cade–87\ndo.” Sowden further explained, “If I have all the facts and I believe someone is guilty,\n\nthen I will go into it with those beliefs. I won’t have an idea at that point. I won’t -- it’s\n\nhard for me to say without knowing all the details.” She asserted again that her answers to\n\nthe special issues would not be automatic: “When I walk in there, I will not say, [t]his\n\nperson should die. I mean, it could be life. I mean, when I step into the second part of this\n\n-- after I hear everything, I can tell you.”\n\n       The entirety of Sowden’s voir dire shows that she made several unequivocal\n\nassertions that she would not automatically vote for a death sentence but would consider\n\nall the evidence and follow the law. To the extent any of her answers on that issue were\n\nunclear or ambiguous, the trial court was in the best position to evaluate her demeanor\n\nand responses. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. We defer to the trial court’s ruling.\n\n       We next turn to Appellant’s contention that Sowden would hold Appellant to a\n\nhigher burden of proof on the insanity determination. During the State’s voir dire, the\n\nprosecutor explained the concept of legal insanity and Appellant’s burden of proof.\n\nSowden stated that she could find Appellant not guilty by reason of insanity if he proved\n\ninsanity by a preponderance of the evidence. Sowden also stated that she could find\n\nAppellant not guilty by reason of insanity on the testimony of one or several witnesses, so\n\nlong as the testimony convinced her by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellant\n\nwas insane at the time of the offense.\n\n       During Appellant’s voir dire, defense counsel also asked Sowden whether, if the\n\f                                                                                     Cade–88\ndefense proved insanity by a preponderance of the evidence through one witness, she\n\nwould have a problem finding Appellant not guilty by reason of insanity. Sowden\n\nanswered that she “would factor it in, certainly.” After explaining the preponderance\n\nstandard again, counsel repeated the question. Sowden responded, “If I believe that\n\nperson is a credible witness. I mean, if that person speaks to me in a manner that I believe\n\nthat person, then yes, I will believe he’s insane.”\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Sowden’s use of the word “credible” and her\n\nintonation when saying it meant that she would elevate Appellant’s burden of proof.\n\nNoting that credibility was part of the preponderance standard’s definition, the trial judge\n\ndenied the challenge. We find no abuse of discretion, as we have defined preponderance\n\nof the evidence as the greater weight of credible evidence that would create a reasonable\n\nbelief in the truth of the claim. See Druery v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2013). Further, the trial judge was in the best position to evaluate Sowden’s\n\ndemeanor and responses. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Point of error thirty is overruled.\n\n                                           J. Evans\n\n       Defense counsel challenged Evans for cause on three grounds: (1) she would\n\nautomatically assess the death penalty, (2) she could not consider evidence about genetics\n\nin answering the mitigation special issue, and (3) she did not understand and could not\n\nfollow the law regarding Appellant’s preponderance burden on insanity. The trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s challenges for cause to Evans.\n\f                                                                                      Cade–89\n       Counsel based his first two reasons for challenging Evans on her juror\n\nquestionnaire answers. Counsel argued that, although Evans stated during voir dire that\n\nshe would change her questionnaire answers now that she had been educated about the\n\nlaw, her demeanor led him to believe that she still held the views expressed in her\n\nquestionnaire and could not follow the law. Appellant does not direct us to any instance\n\nfrom Evans’s voir dire in which she indicated that she understood the law, but she held\n\ncontrary personal views that she could not set aside, nor does our review reveal any. As to\n\nher demeanor during voir dire when questioned about these issues, the trial judge was in\n\nthe best position to evaluate it, and we defer to his determination. Id.\n\n       Regarding the challenge related to his burden of proof on the insanity\n\ndetermination, Appellant relies on an exchange that occurred during the defense’s voir\n\ndire. When the prosecutor initially defined legal insanity and explained Appellant’s\n\npreponderance burden of proof, Evans stated that she could find Appellant not guilty by\n\nreason of insanity if the defense proved insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, even\n\nif the evidence came through one witness. Evans also stated that she would not hold\n\nAppellant to a higher burden than the preponderance standard. Near the end of\n\nAppellant’s voir dire, defense counsel also defined legal insanity and explained\n\nAppellant’s burden of proof. Counsel then gave Evans a hypothetical in the following\n\nexchange:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. If whatever evidence was brought to you, even if it was\n       by one person, and the State did prove -- I mean the defense, excuse me, I\n\f                                                                                    Cade–90\n       misstated. -- the defense proved this defense of insanity by a preponderance\n       of the evidence, your verdict would be what?\n\n       [EVANS]: If the State did prove?\n\n       [DEFENSE]: No, I misstated.\n\n       [EVANS]: I mean if the defense did prove?\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Let’s start over, okay?\n\n       [EVANS]: Okay.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Because I think I screwed it up. I explained the burden of\n       proof. This table has the burden of proof on insanity.\n\n       [EVANS]: Okay.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: The burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence. If\n       we, by one witness or whatever the witness says, and you believe this\n       witness by a preponderance of the evidence and the defense has met that\n       burden in your mind, what would your verdict be or what would you vote\n       for?\n\n       [EVANS]: I guess the insanity one?\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Uh-huh. You could find somebody not guilty by reason of\n       insanity?\n\n       [EVANS]: Yes.\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Evans’s demeanor during the foregoing exchange was\n\n“very inquisitive,” as if she “wasn’t sure” and wanted someone to tell her how to respond.\n\nThe State countered that it had been clear that Evans was simply confused due to defense\n\ncounsel’s initial misstatement. The trial judge, who was in the best position to assess\n\nEvans’s demeanor and responses, denied the challenge. We defer to his decision. Id. Point\n\f                                                                                    Cade–91\nof error thirty-one is overruled.\n\n                                        K. Matthews\n\n       Defense counsel argued that Matthews “hesitated” during voir dire questioning,\n\nwhich indicated that she could not follow the law on insanity and would hold the defense\n\nto a higher burden than the law required. Appellant directs us to Matthews’s response\n\nwhen the prosecutor asked whether she could find Appellant not guilty by reason of\n\ninsanity based on the testimony of one witness. Although Matthews answered, “Yes,” the\n\nprosecutor indicated that he perceived some hesitation in her response. When he asked\n\nwhether the hesitation was because the decision would be distasteful, Matthews\n\nanswered, “No,” but stated that “it [would] take great pondering.” She continued, “It’s not\n\ngoing to be a quick decision, in other words.”\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the challenge for cause.\n\nMatthews’s reference to “pondering” and subsequent clarification did not unequivocally\n\nestablish an inability to follow the law. See Moore, 999 S.W.2d at 407. Moreover, when\n\nquestioned by the defense regarding her ability to find Appellant not guilty by reason of\n\ninsanity on a preponderance of the evidence, Matthews again asserted that she could do\n\nso. Matthews’s voir dire sufficiently supports the trial court’s ruling. See Davis, 329\n\nS.W.3d at 807. Point of error thirty-two is overruled.\n\n                                          L. Adair\n\n       Defense counsel raised three challenges for cause to Adair, all of which the trial\n\f                                                                                      Cade–92\ncourt denied. We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n       First, defense counsel argued that Adair would automatically vote for the death\n\npenalty. Defense counsel acknowledged that, during the State’s voir dire, Adair had\n\nindicated that he could and would follow all the law applicable to sentencing, but defense\n\ncounsel asserted that, during the defense’s voir dire, Adair “differentiated and went back\n\nand forth and vacillated on his true feelings,” such that counsel believed Adair’s “true\n\nopinion [was] that if somebody kills somebody, that they deserve to die.”\n\n       After reviewing Adair’s entire voir dire, we disagree that he took positions during\n\ndefense questioning that were materially different than the answers he gave during the\n\nState’s questioning. But even if we were to accept Appellant’s argument, we give\n\nparticular deference to the trial court’s ruling when a prospective juror vacillates or gives\n\nequivocal or contradictory answers concerning his ability to follow the law. Gardner, 306\n\nS.W.3d at 295.\n\n       Second, defense counsel argued that Adair would hold Appellant to a higher\n\nburden of proof than the law required regarding insanity. Defense counsel based his\n\nassertion on Adair’s response when the prosecutor questioned him about his answer to\n\nQuestion 38 of the juror questionnaire. Question 38 informed potential jurors that a\n\nperson with mental illness can receive life without parole or the death penalty for\n\ncommitting capital murder, then asked for the juror’s thoughts. Adair wrote, “Life\n\nwithout parole no death penalty on a person with mental illness.” The prosecutor\n\f                                                                                     Cade–93\nquestioned Adair as follows:\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: First of all, would you agree with me that anyone can\n       just claim they have a mental illness?\n\n       [ADAIR]: Yes.\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Would you agree with me that mental illness\n       exists on a range of very mild, like a person with mild depression, all the\n       way up to severe where a person just doesn’t even understand the difference\n       between right and wrong?\n\n       [ADAIR]: Right.\n\n       [STATE]: Okay. Now, are you saying to me that, no matter what the extent\n       of the mental illness is, that you’ll never consider the death penalty, or are\n       you saying if they are on a far end of that scale that you wouldn’t consider\n       it?\n\n       [ADAIR]: No, on a far end.\n\nThis line of questioning and Adair’s “far end” response concerned a punishment issue\n\nrather than the affirmative defense of insanity. Appellant identifies nothing else in Adair’s\n\nvoir dire suggesting that he would elevate the burden of proof regarding the insanity\n\ndetermination, and we find nothing in our independent review.\n\n       Third, defense counsel asserted that Adair’s testimony when questioned about his\n\nwritten response to Question 17 of the questionnaire showed that he would require any\n\nevidence of remorse to come through Appellant’s testimony. Question 17 asked jurors\n\nwhat would be important to them in deciding whether a person received a death sentence\n\nrather than a life sentence in a capital-murder case. In pertinent part, Adair indicated that\n\na lack of remorse would be significant to him.\n\f                                                                                       Cade–94\n       The prosecutor informed Adair that a defendant has a constitutional right not to\n\ntestify and that if the defendant elects not to testify, a juror may not hold that choice\n\nagainst him. Adair stated that he could and would follow the law. When defense counsel\n\nquestioned Adair, counsel noted his mention of remorse in response to Question 17.\n\nDefense counsel asked whether Adair would require a defendant “to actually testify and\n\nsay, look, I’m sorry I did that, or something like that, in the punishment stage?” Adair\n\nsaid that he would not, but he struggled to explain:\n\n       No, I think the remorse would -- I don’t know if that’s a state of mind or it\n       goes along with like their moral [culpability]. I think it’s, you know, like\n       they have no feeling when they do it, you know, like they are not\n       remorse[ful] about killing another human being.\n\n       Defense counsel then suggested that a defendant’s testimony might be the only\n\nway for him to provide evidence of remorse:\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. Do you see where I’m coming from? To actually -- I\n       mean the way we give information to each other is either through, you\n       know, some kind of gesture, words, or writings.\n\n       [ADAIR]: Right, right, right. I guess --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: And, so, I guess my question is, you know, how would you\n       receive the information about if a person was remorseful, you know, if you\n       didn’t require him to testify or give you some information about remorse,\n       like I’m sorry or something?\n\n       [ADAIR]: I guess explaining through the act of violence, I guess that would\n       be --\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Are you saying that, during the act of violence, they would\n       have to say, I’m sorry, or something like [that]?\n\f                                                                                      Cade–95\n       [ADAIR]: No, just, or their mental, trying to say their state of mind at the\n       time of doing the crime.\n\n       [DEFENSE]: Okay. I guess I’m confused. I am totally confused in that\n       sense.\n\n       [ADAIR]: I’m a little confused myself.\n\nWhen defense counsel again asked Adair to explain how one would know whether\n\nsomeone was remorseful or not, Adair responded, “I guess through their actions, maybe\n\nyou could tell. I don’t know, if they were crying or I guess however you could tell\n\nwhether they are remorse[ful] or not.”\n\n       It was within the trial court’s discretion to deny Appellant’s challenge for cause.\n\nThe proponent of a cause-based challenge must show that the challenge is proper and\n\ndoes not meet this burden until, among other things, he demonstrates that the law was\n\nexplained to and understood by the venire member. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. When the\n\nprosecutor explained a defendant’s constitutional right not to testify, Adair stated that he\n\ncould and would follow the law. When defense counsel discussed the topic, it was in the\n\ncontext of how jurors could ascertain whether a defendant felt remorse. Defense counsel\n\ndid not explain to Adair that jurors could determine whether a defendant felt remorse at\n\nthe time of the offense by drawing reasonable inferences from circumstantial evidence\n\npresented at trial. See Snowden v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823–24 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\nRather, it seems that counsel inaccurately implied through his questions that only the\n\ndefendant, by testifying, could supply such evidence. Despite the apparent misdirection,\n\f                                                                                       Cade–96\nAdair evinced an understanding that circumstantial evidence may provide a basis for\n\ninferring remorse. Appellant points to nothing in the record to show that Adair could not\n\nor would not consider such circumstantial evidence, if it were offered, or that he would\n\nrequire evidence of remorse to come from Appellant himself. Point of error thirty-four is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                    M. Koshy and Newton\n\n       Because Appellant received two additional peremptory strikes, he can demonstrate\n\nharm only by showing that the trial court erroneously denied at least three of his\n\nchallenges for cause to the seventeen veniremembers at issue in points of error eighteen\n\nthrough thirty-four. See Chambers, 866 S.W.2d at 23. We have reviewed Appellant’s\n\nchallenges for cause to fifteen of those potential jurors and found no error by the trial\n\ncourt. Accordingly, even if we assume that the trial court erred in denying Appellant’s\n\nchallenges for cause to the two remaining veniremembers at issue, Koshy and Newton,\n\nAppellant cannot show harm on appeal. See id. Points of error nineteen and twenty are\n\noverruled.\n\n                    VIII. V OIR DIRE—R EMAINING POINTS OF ERROR\n\n       In point of error thirty-five, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred by not\n\npermitting defense counsel to ask venire member Morgan about the types of evidence she\n\nmight consider mitigating. During the State’s voir dire, the prosecutor explained to\n\nMorgan that jurors must be able to consider all of the evidence, including evidence of the\n\f                                                                                       Cade–97\nvictims’ experience of the offense, when answering the mitigation special issue. See Art.\n\n37.071, § 2(e)(1). When questioning Morgan, defense counsel referred to the State’s point\n\nabout considering the victims’ perspective. Defense counsel asserted that evidence\n\nconcerning the victims’ experience of the offense could have mitigating or aggravating\n\nvalue. Defense counsel asked Morgan if she could foresee circumstances in which such\n\nevidence could be mitigating. After Morgan responded that she could, defense counsel\n\nasked her to give examples, at which point the State successfully objected.\n\n       We review a trial court’s ruling that limits voir dire questioning for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Hernandez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). Appellant\n\nacknowledges that we have previously held that questions such as the one defense\n\ncounsel posed are improper. See id. (“Whether a juror considers a particular type of\n\nevidence to be mitigating is not a proper area of inquiry.”). To the extent Appellant argues\n\nthat our precedent is inconsistent with the holding of Lockett v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604\n\n(1978), we disagree. Lockett’s holding requires that the sentencer in a capital case not be\n\nprecluded from considering, as a mitigating factors, any aspect of the defendant’s\n\ncharacter, record, or any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as\n\na basis for a sentence less than death. Id. at 604. We see nothing in Lockett that permits a\n\ndefendant to ask a prospective juror the kind of question that Appellant sought to ask\n\nMorgan. The trial court did not abuse its discretion. Point of error thirty-five is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-six, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred during voir\n\f                                                                                     Cade–98\ndire when it allowed the prosecutor to misstate the law concerning the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue. The alleged misstatements occurred during the State’s\n\nquestioning of veniremembers Johnlouis and Evans.\n\n       The future-dangerousness special issue requires jurors to determine “whether there\n\nis a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would\n\nconstitute a continuing threat to society.” Art. 37.071, § 2(b)(1). The record shows that\n\nthe prosecutor focused on the implications of the words “would” and “threat” in the\n\nspecial issue. The prosecutor asserted that the future-dangerousness special issue asks\n\njurors to consider what threat the defendant’s “mere existence” would pose, even\n\nassuming the possibility that he “would sit in his cell every day and never commit a\n\ncriminal act of violence.” Alternatively, the prosecutor explained that the special issue\n\nasks jurors to consider whether the defendant “would” commit criminal acts of violence\n\nthat would constitute a continuing threat to society, “if he could.” After the prosecution\n\nrephrased the question, the trial court overruled Appellant’s objections that the\n\nprosecutor’s statements still misstated the law.\n\n       We have previously construed the future dangerousness issue as focusing on an\n\nindividual’s character for violence and his internal restraints, rather than merely the\n\nexternal restraints of incarceration and likelihood of incapacitation. See, e.g., Coble, 330\n\nS.W.3d at 268–69; Estrada v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1890229\"><a href=\"/opinion/1890229/estrada-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281–82 n.5 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\nThe prosecutor’s statements were generally consistent with this. Accordingly, we\n\f                                                                                        Cade–99\nconclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in overruling Appellant’s\n\nobjections. Further, the record shows that neither Johnlouis nor Evans served on\n\nAppellant’s jury. Thus, even if we were to determine that error occurred, it did not affect\n\nAppellant’s substantial rights. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 44.2(b). Point of error thirty-six is\n\noverruled.\n\n                 IX. C ONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES TO A RTICLE 37.071\n\n       In point of error thirty-seven, Appellant argues that Article 37.071, section 2(f)(4),\n\nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution because\n\nit limits the jurors’ consideration to evidence that implicates the defendant’s moral\n\nblameworthiness. In point of error thirty-eight, Appellant asserts that Article 37.071\n\nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it does not provide a burden of\n\nproof regarding the mitigation special issue. In point of error thirty-nine, Appellant\n\ncontends that the “10-12” provision found in Article 37.071, sections 2(d)(2) and (f)(2),\n\nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it misleads the jury. In point of\n\nerror forty, Appellant alleges that Article 37.071, section 2(f)(4), violates the Eighth\n\nAmendment because it does not require the jury to consider mitigating evidence, and for\n\nthe same reason, the trial court’s jury instruction pursuant to Article 37.071, section\n\n2(f)(4), also violated the Eighth Amendment. In point of error forty-one, Appellant\n\ncontends that Article 37.071, section 2(a), violates the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments because it prohibits the jury from being informed about the consequences of\n\f                                                                                    Cade–100\na single holdout juror. In point of error forty-two, Appellant asserts that Texas’s capital\n\nsentencing scheme violates the Supreme Court’s holding in Ring v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2002). In point of error forty-three, Appellant avers that Article 37.071, section 2(b)(1),\n\nviolates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it does not define the terms\n\n“probability,” “continuing threat to society,” “criminal acts of violence,” and “continuing\n\nthreat.” In point of error forty-four, Appellant alleges that Article 37.071 violates the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding in Bush v. Gore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118395\"><a href=\"/opinion/118395/bush-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), because it does not\n\nprovide a method by which the state determines a defendant’s death-worthiness.\n\n       Appellant acknowledges that we have previously rejected claims identical to points\n\nof error thirty-seven through thirty-nine and forty-one through forty-three. See, e.g.,\n\nCoble, 330 S.W.3d at 296; Williams, 301 S.W.3d at 694; Roberts v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756181\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756181/roberts-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 534 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Although Appellant fails to mention controlling\n\nprecedent from this Court, we have previously rejected the claims he raises in points of\n\nerror forty and forty-four. See, e.g., Lucero v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1402471\"><a href=\"/opinion/1402471/lucero-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 (Tex.

Crim. App. 2007). Appellant’s\n\narguments do not persuade us to revisit these issues. Points of error thirty-seven through\n\nforty-four are overruled.\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                                          Hervey, J.\n\nDelivered: February 25, 2015\n\f                 Cade–101\nDo Not Publish\n\f</pre>",
