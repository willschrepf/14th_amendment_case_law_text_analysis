App. P. </span><span>34.6(c)(1). </span><span> Appellant, Michael Rosenblatt, challenges denial of his motion\r\nto set aside jury findings that resulted in no recovery on Rosenblatt's request for an\r\naward of attorneys' fees.  Rosenblatt contends that an award of $500,000 in attorneys'\r\nfees was proper, notwithstanding the jury's verdict, and contends that we are\r\ncompelled to render judgment in his favor as a matter of law, because (1) he was\r\nstatutorily entitled to attorneys' fees and (2) the evidence supporting his request for\r\nattorneys' fees is uncontroverted.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 301 (authorizing judgment\r\nnotwithstanding verdict).  Because Rosenblatt seeks only rendition, and not a remand\r\nfor trial, we conclude there is no reversible error and affirm.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>Background</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRosenblatt is a former agent for appellee, Freedom Life Insurance Company\r\nof America.<sup> (1)</sup>  After sustaining injuries in a July 1999 automobile accident, Rosenblatt\r\nasserted claims for healthcare benefits from Freedom Life.  Rosenblatt sued Freedom\r\nLife, seeking damages for the company's delays in investigating his claims and in\r\npaying him compensation.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRosenblatt filed suit on September 1, 2001 and amended his pleadings six\r\ntimes to assert varied common-law theories and multiple claims under the Insurance\r\nCode and the Deceptive Trade and Consumer Practices Act.  Freedom Life obtained\r\na partial summary judgment that narrowed these claims before the seven-day trial\r\nbegan, and the disputed issues narrowed further during trial.  The case was ultimately\r\nsubmitted to the jury on Rosenblatt's common-law claim for bad faith and his claim\r\nthat Freedom Life violated former article 21.21, section 4(10)(a)(v)(A) of the\r\nInsurance Code and committed an unfair settlement practice by failing to affirm or\r\ndeny coverage within a reasonable time.<sup> (2)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury rejected Rosenblatt's common-law claim, but found, in response to\r\nthe Insurance Code question, that Freedom Life \"fail[ed] to affirm or deny coverage\r\nof a claim within a reasonable time.\"  The jury awarded Rosenblatt $10,000 in\r\ndamages for future physical impairment and $20,000 for conduct committed\r\nknowingly.  The jury awarded no damages for past and future mental anguish,\r\nphysical pain, medical bills, and past physical impairment.  In addition, and as\r\nchallenged here, the jury awarded no (\"zero\") damages, in response to a three-pronged question concerning attorneys' fees, for trial, appeal to this Court, and appeal\r\nto the Supreme Court of Texas.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter denying motions to disregard the jury's findings filed by both parties, the\r\ntrial court rendered judgment for Rosenblatt for $10,000 for future damages and\r\n$20,000 in additional damages, plus interest and costs.  Rosenblatt did not file a\r\nmotion for new trial.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>Legal Sufficiency Challenge to \"Zero\" Damages for Attorneys' Fees</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his sole issue on appeal, Rosenblatt contends he is entitled to judgment as\r\na matter of law because no evidence supports the jury's failure to award any damages\r\nin response to the question concerning attorneys' fees.  Rosenblatt preserved this\r\nissue for appeal through his motion to disregard the jury's failure to award any\r\namount for attorneys' fees at trial.  In the motion, as here, Rosenblatt argued that the\r\ntrial court was compelled to disregarded the jury's zero findings and to render\r\njudgment for statutorily authorized attorneys' fees of $500,000.<sup> (3)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A.\tStandard of Review</strong> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court may disregard a jury's verdict and render judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict pursuant to rule 301 if no evidence supports the jury's\r\nfindings or if a directed verdict would have been proper.  <em>Tiller v. McLure</em>, 121\r\nS.W.3d 709, 713 (Tex. 2003); <em>Brown v. Bank of Galveston, N.A.</em>, 963 S.W.2d 511,\r\n513 (Tex. 1998); <em>Williams v. Briscoe</em>, 137 S.W.3d 120, 124 (Tex. App.--Houston\r\n[1st Dist.] 2004, no pet.).  A challenge to a ruling on a judgment notwithstanding the\r\nverdict requires \"no evidence,\" i.e., legal-sufficiency review.  <em>See Wal-Mart Stores,\r\nInc. v. Miller</em>, 102 S.W.3d 706, 709 (Tex. 2003); <em>Williams</em>, 137 S.W.3d at 124; <em>see\r\nalso City of Keller v. Wilson</em>, 168 S.W.3d 803, 823 (Tex. 2005) (\"[T]he test for legal\r\nsufficiency should be the same for summary judgments, directed verdicts, judgments\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict, and appellate no-evidence review.\").<sup> (4)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs the party seeking attorneys' fees, who therefore carried the burden of proof,\r\n<em>see Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991), Rosenblatt\r\nmust demonstrate on appeal that the evidence conclusively established all vital facts\r\nin support of his claim as a matter of law.  <em>Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co.</em>, 767 S.W.2d\r\n686, 690 (Tex. 1989); <em>accord Cale's Clean Scene Carwash, Inc. v. Hubbard</em>, 76\r\nS.W.3d 784, 786 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (\"A trial court may\r\ndisregard a jury's negative finding and substitute its own affirmative finding only if\r\nthe evidence conclusively establishes the affirmative finding.\").  In reviewing a legal-sufficiency challenge by the party who had the burden of proof at trial, the dispositive\r\ninquiry is whether the record establishes a proposition that contradicts the jury's\r\nfinding as a matter of law.   <em>See Sterner</em>, 767 S.W.2d at 690.  Only then may we\r\nsustain the legal-sufficiency challenge.  <em>See id.</em>  </span><span><em>City of Keller</em> confirms the four\r\ninstances in which a legal sufficiency challenge must be sustained, as follows:  (1)\r\nthere is complete absence of a vital fact; (2) the rules of law or evidence preclude\r\naccording weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence\r\noffered to prove a vital fact is no more than a scintilla; and (4) the evidence\r\nconclusively establishes the opposite of a vital fact.  168 S.W.3d at 810 &amp; n.16 (Tex.\r\n2005) (citing, among other cases, <em>King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman</em>, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751\r\n(Tex. 2003)).</span><span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn applying the legal-sufficiency standard, we must credit evidence that\r\nsupports the judgment if reasonable jurors could credit that evidence, and we must\r\ndisregard contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not disregard that\r\nevidence.  <em>City of Keller</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 827.  Accordingly, we review the evidence\r\nin the light most favorable to the verdict, but disregard all contrary evidence that a\r\nreasonable jury could have disbelieved.  <em>Ysleta Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Monarrez</em>, 177\r\nS.W.3d 915, 917 (Tex. 2005) (citing <em>City of Keller</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 812).  If the\r\nevidence falls within the zone of reasonable disagreement, we may not invade the role\r\nof the fact-finder, who alone determines the credibility of the witnesses, the weight\r\nto give their testimony, and whether to accept or reject all or any part of that\r\ntestimony.  <em>City of Keller</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 822.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIt is generally true that a fact finder is free to believe all, part, or none of the\r\ntestimony of a witness, but a fact-finder's \"decisions regarding credibility must be\r\nreasonable.\"  <em>Id. </em>at 820.  The fact finder \"cannot ignore undisputed testimony that is\r\nclear, positive, direct, otherwise credible, free from contradictions and\r\ninconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted.\"  <em>Id.  </em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B.\tFormer Article 21.21, § 16(b)(1) Mandates \"Reasonable and Necessary\"\r\nFees Recovery for Party Who Prevails and Recovers Damages</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>1.\t<em>Party Who Prevails and Recovers Damages is Entitled to Attorneys'\r\nFees</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tWell-settled law precludes awarding attorneys' fees without statutory or\r\ncontractual authority.  <em>Holland v.

Act of May 19, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch.\r\n414, § 11, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 2988, 2999 (repealed 2003); <em>see </em></span><span>former article 21.21,\r\nsection 16(b)(1) (\"In a suit filed under this section, any plaintiff who <em>prevails </em>may\r\nobtain . . . . the amount of actual damages plus court costs and reasonable and\r\nnecessary attorneys' fees.\") (emphasis added);</span><span><sup> (5)</sup> <em>State Farm Life Ins.

Progressive Voters League</em>, 801 S.W.2d 880, 881-82 (Tex.\r\n1990) (same).<sup> (6)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Rosenblatt has expressly declined a new trial, both in the trial court\r\nand on appeal, the dispositive question becomes whether Rosenblatt established, as\r\na matter of law, that he is entitled to $500,000 as reasonable and necessary attorneys'\r\nfees.  Specifically, did Rosenblatt provide evidence to support his claim for attorneys'\r\nfees that was \"clear, positive, direct, otherwise credible, free from contradictions and\r\ninconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted\"?  <em>See City of Keller</em>, 168\r\nS.W.3d at 822; <em>Ragsdale</em>, 801 S.W.2d at 881-82.  We agree with the trial court that\r\nhe did not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C.\tRosenblatt Did Not Conclusively Establish that the $500,000 in Attorneys'\r\nFees Was Reasonable and Necessary</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tRosenblatt's trial counsel, Tracy Conwell, referred several times during her\r\ntestimony to the amount of $500,000, describing it as a \"reasonable\" amount of\r\nattorneys' fees for the work she had done in this case.  In addition to relying on that\r\ntestimony, Rosenblatt argues that Freedom Life (1) did not controvert Conwell's\r\ntestimony and (2) conceded that the testimony was uncontroverted in responding to\r\nRosenblatt's motion to disregard the jury's failure to award any attorneys' fees. \r\nRelying on the <em>Ragsdale</em> decision, Rosenblatt argues that this concession precludes\r\nFreedom Life's contending on appeal that the jury and the trial court properly rejected\r\nConwell's evidence in declining to award attorneys' fees.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRosenblatt misconstrues <em>Ragsdale</em>, which recognized an exception to the\r\ngeneral rule that an interested witness \"does no more than raise a fact issue to be\r\ndetermined by the jury.\"  <em>See id.</em> at 882.  The exception arises when the testimony of\r\nan interested witness \"is not contradicted by any other witness, or attendant\r\ncircumstances, and the same is clear, direct and positive, and free from contradiction,\r\ninaccuracies, and circumstances tending to cast suspicion thereon.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 882; <em>see\r\nBrown</em>, 963 S.W.2d at515-16 (citing <em>Ragsdale</em>, 801 S.W.2d at 882).  Applying the\r\nexception in <em>Ragsdale</em>, the supreme court ruled that the trial court erred by not taking\r\nas true, \"as a matter of law,\" the testimony of the interested witness, an attorney who\r\ntestified without objection that $22,500 was a reasonable amount for attorneys' fees. \r\n<em>Id</em>. at 881-82.  The exception is \"<em>especially true</em>,\" the court observed, and Rosenblatt\r\nemphasizes, when \"the opposing party has the means and opportunity of disproving\r\nthe testimony,\" but did not object.  <em>Ragsdale</em>, 801 S.W.2d at 882 (emphasis in\r\noriginal).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<em>Ragsdale</em> clarified, however, that failure to controvert is but one factor among\r\nothers that the court considers in determining whether the testimony merely raises a\r\nfact issue or may be accepted as true as a matter of law.  <em>Id.</em>  <em>Ragsdale </em>and recent\r\ninterpretations of <em>Ragsdale </em>demonstrate that the uncontroverted testimony of an\r\ninterested witness will establish that attorneys' fees sought are reasonable and\r\nnecessary as a matter of law, thus authorizing rendition by an appellate court, but only\r\nif the following conditions exist:  (1) the testimony could readily be contradicted if\r\nuntrue; (2) the testimony is clear, direct, and positive; and (3) there are no\r\ncircumstances that tend to discredit or impeach the testimony.  <em>Ragsdale</em>, 801 S.W.2d\r\nat 882; <em>McMillin v. State Farm Lloyds</em>, 180 S.W.3d 183, 210 (Tex. App.--Austin\r\n2005, pet. denied) (citing <em>Lofton v. Tex. Brine Corp.</em>, 777 S.W.2d 384, 386 (Tex.\r\n1989)); <em>Hubbard</em>, 76 S.W.3d at 786 (also citing <em>Lofton</em>, 777 S.W.2d at 386). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe examine Conwell's testimony within these guidelines.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>1.\t<em>Uncontroverted or Controvertible? </em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe do not agree that Conwell's testimony conclusively established that\r\n$500,000 was a reasonable amount for attorneys' fees or that her testimony was\r\nuncontroverted, because Conwell controverted her own testimony.  Despite testifying\r\nthat $500,000 was a reasonable fee, Conwell also explained the terms of her\r\ncontingency-fee contract, the total hours worked, and her hourly rate.<sup> (8)</sup>  She testified\r\nthat a 40 percent fee, as described in her contract, was reasonable.  Conwell did not\r\nperform a step-by-step calculation of a total amount from the terms and percentages\r\nstated in the contract, but invited the jury to make the calculation.  As this Court\r\nrecognized recently, if a party presents evidence of <em>both</em> a fixed amount as a\r\nreasonable attorneys' fee and a contingency-fee contract that results in a lesser fee\r\nand claims that the contract was reasonable and that the jury could rely on either\r\ncalculation, that party may not argue on appeal that the evidence attesting to the\r\nreasonableness of the higher amount is uncontroverted.  <em>Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ray\r\nFerguson Interests, Inc.</em>, No. 01-02-00807-CV, 2006 WL 648834, at *11, 13-14\r\n(Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] Mar. 16, 2006, pet. denied) (mem. op.).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConwell also provided other amounts for the jury.  She not only testified that\r\nher evidence suggested an award for attorneys' fees \"in the neighborhood of\r\n$400,000, maybe $350,000,\" but also acknowledged that her contingency-fee contract\r\ncould be interpreted as resulting in the significantly lesser sum of 40 percent of\r\nRosenblatt's total recovery, or $12,000.  In other testimony, Conwell estimated her\r\npersonal total time at 997 hours at $250 per hour, which results in yet another\r\ncalculation of approximately $250,000, to which was to be added her law clerks' fees,\r\nwhich Conwell \"guess[ed] a reaonable rate would be anywhere between [$]25 and\r\n$75 an hour,\" though she also invited the jury to \"figure out a reasonable rate.\" \r\nAdding the law clerks' fees to the $250,000 and calculating them in accordance with\r\nthe range Conwell suggested results in yet another total, with an approximate high of\r\n$340,000 and a low of $287,000. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConwell also testified that the $500,000 estimate included \"over\" $100,000 in\r\nexpenses.  But the trial court sustained Freedom Life's objections to several items\r\nlisted as expenses on the grounds that they were not recoverable.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Conwell's own testimony provided alternatives to the $500,000\r\namount that she opined was a reasonable fee and because her proposed amounts\r\nincluded nonrecoverable costs, we cannot agree that her testimony on the $500,000\r\namount was uncontroverted.  To the contrary, Conwell's testimony that $500,000 was\r\na reasonable award for attorneys' fees was both controvertible and controverted--by\r\nConwell.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>2.\t<em>Clear, Positive, Direct, and Free from Inconsistencies?</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConwell's testimony as to the varying amounts and calculations, described\r\nabove, conflicts with and contradicts the $500,000 ceiling amount and is thus\r\ninconsistent with a clearly demonstrated award of $500,000.  Moreover, Conwell\r\nacknowledged that her figures were estimates and invited the jurors to \"figure a\r\nreasonable fee,\" stating that she \"was not going to add it up\" for them.  Conwell also\r\nconceded under cross-examination that only \"some\" of the attorney time recorded in\r\nher entries had been entered contemporaneously.  She had constructed the remainder\r\nfrom estimates.  Conwell's inconsistencies, estimates, and equivocation render her\r\ntestimony less than clear, positive, and direct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>3.\t<em>Free of Circumstances that Tend to Discredit or Impeach?</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs shown above, Freedom Life successfully impeached Conwell's testimony\r\nthat $500,000 was a reasonable attorneys' fee for this case, first  by cross-examination\r\nof Conwell to emphasize that her calculations were estimates reconstructed from\r\nhindsight, and then by successfully objecting to recovery of certain costs and\r\nexpenses. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe note as well that over the five years that Conwell spent preparing this case,\r\nthe claims asserted against Freedom Life on Rosenblatt's behalf reduced significantly,\r\nwith but two theories ultimately submitted to the jury.  According to Conwell, it was\r\nnecessary for her to do as much work as she did because of the difficulty in\r\nascertaining what Freedom Life did and how Freedom Life did it.  She would \"need\r\nto do it all,\" she claimed, \"whether suing for bad faith or 21.55 or 21.21 because those\r\nclaims are so intertwined that [she could not] separate them.\"  <em>See C.M. Asfahl\r\nAgency v. Tensor, Inc</em>., 135 S.W.3d 768, 801 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2004,\r\nno pet.) (recognizing both duty to segregate between recoverable and nonrecoverable\r\nclaims in seeking attorneys' fees and exception to duty for intertwined claims arising\r\nout of same occurrence).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn addition to the \"bad faith or 21.55 or 21.21\" claims to which Conwell\r\nreferred in explaining that her work was not severable, however, Rosenblatt's live\r\npleadings include additional claims, none of which was submitted to the jury, though\r\nthey had survived pretrial motions for summary judgment.  These claims were for\r\nunfair settlement practices; deceptive trade practices, including claims for\r\nunconscionable conduct and for conspiracy to violate the deceptive trade statue; and\r\nstatutory libel.  In addition, Rosenblatt attempted to show at trial that Freedom Life\r\nwas engaged in a common enterprise with the two additionally named defendants.<sup> (9)</sup> \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo the extent that the jury may have heard testimony relating to these\r\nremaining claims, however, Conwell did not include them with those described as too\r\n\"intertwined\" to enable segregation and thus discredited her own testimony that\r\n$500,000 was a reasonable fee.  It is rationally to be anticipated that a jury that\r\nexamines a charge with only two liability questions and awards damages for only one\r\nof these would discredit evidence that attempted to recover an award for attorneys'\r\nfees for claims that the jury was not asked to decide.  <em>See Cordova v. Sw. Bell Yellow\r\nPages, Inc.</em>, 148 S.W.3d 441, 449 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2004, no pet.) (recognizing\r\nthat party liable for attorneys' fees \"should not be held responsible for time spent in\r\noverpreparation\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn presenting herself as a qualified witness to testify on the claim for attorneys'\r\nfees, Conwell stated she was \"familiar with law firms in this town\" and knew \"what\r\npeople charge.\"  She did not, however, explain either her personal familiarity or\r\nexperience with the type of claims that she pursued against Freedom Life on\r\nRosenblatt's behalf.  Moreover, in accordance with former article 21.21, section\r\n16(b)(1), which requires that attorneys' fees awarded be both reasonable <em>and\r\n</em>necessary, the jury was properly asked to determine \"a reasonable fee for the\r\n<em>necessary</em> services of [Conwell].\"  <em>See</em> Act of May 19, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 414,\r\n§ 13, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 2988, 3000 (repealed 2003); <em>Bocquet</em>, 972 S.W.2d at 21. \r\nThough Conwell summarized her work for this case, evidence concerning the\r\nnecessity of the work was lacking.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>4.\t<em>Consequences:  Fact Issue Raised, but Resolved by Jury, and Relief\r\nby Rendition Neither Urged Nor Preserved.</em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t<em>City of Keller</em> reaffirms that a fact is not proved \" as a matter of law\" when the\r\nrules of law or evidence preclude according effect to the only evidence offered to\r\nestablish a vital fact. <em>City of Keller</em>, </span><span>168 S.W.3d </span><span>at 810 &amp; n.16.  Under the three-pronged <em>Ragsdale</em> analysis just presented, we cannot agree that Conwell's testifying\r\nthat $500,000 was a reasonable attorneys' fee for this case, was \"uncontroverted\"as\r\na matter of law and therefore conclude that a $500,000 fee was not established as a\r\nmatter of law.  <em>See Ragsdale</em>, 801 S.W.2d at 882; <em>and compare McMillin</em>, 180 S.W.3d\r\nat 210 (rejecting contention that testimony supporting attorneys' fees was\r\nuncontroverted) <em>with Brown</em>, 963 S.W.2d at 515, <em>and Hubbard</em>, 76 S.W.3d at 787-88\r\n(both holding that testimony supporting attorneys' fees was uncontroverted). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Conwell's testimony failed, therefore, to conclusively establish the\r\n$500,000 fee, as a matter law, her interested-witness testimony raised only a triable\r\nissue to be determined by trier of fact, in this case, the jury.  <em>See Ragsdale</em>, 801\r\nS.W.2d at 882; <em>McMillin</em>, 180 S.W.3d at 211 (remanding for determination whether\r\nentire amount of attorneys' fees sought was reasonable and necessary, because issue\r\nnot conclusively established).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe fact finder \"cannot ignore undisputed testimony that is clear, positive,\r\ndirect, otherwise credible, free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could\r\nhave been readily controverted.\" <em> City of Keller</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 820; <em>accord</em> <em>Ragsdale</em>,\r\n801 S.W.2d at 882 (employing identical test in concluding that issue established as\r\nmatter of law).  But Conwell did not provide undisputed testimony that was clear,\r\npositive, direct and otherwise credible; instead she contradicted and controverted her\r\nher own testimony.  Accordingly, the jury, was authorized to disregard her testimony\r\nthat $500,000 was a reasonable attorneys' fee, if the jury did disregard that testimony,\r\nwhen the jury answered the factual issue presented by the attorneys' fee question in\r\nthe court's charge.  <em>See City of Keller</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 819-20; <em>Ragsdale</em>, 801 S.W.2d\r\nat 882.  By the same analysis, the trial court properly declined Rosenblatt's limited\r\nchallenge to the jury's decision--his request that the trial court (1) disregard the\r\njury's \"zero\" damages response to the attorneys' fee question and (2) render judgment\r\nnotwithstanding that finding for $500,000.  <em>See City of Keller</em>, 168 S.W.3d at 820;\r\n<em>Ragsdale</em>, 801 S.W.2d at 822. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tContinuing his trial strategy on appeal, Rosenblatt  seeks only rendition in the\r\namount of $500,000, having affirmatively rejected relief by remand, both as preserved\r\nin the trial court and as presented here, not only through reliance on a partial\r\nreporter's record, but also through the narrow issue asserted in his brief and during\r\noral argument.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the evidence presented in support of Rosenblatt's claim for attorneys'\r\nfees is not conclusive as a matter of law and thus precludes that relief, we cannot\r\nrender the judgment that Rosenblatt seeks.  <em>See McMillin</em>, 180 S.W.3d at 211 (\"We\r\ncannot render judgment . . . because the evidence is not conclusive.\").  Though our\r\nsister court reversed and ordered a remand in <em>McMillin</em>, the appellant there had\r\nalternatively requested that relief.  <em>See id</em>. at  210-11 (stating that sustaining legal-sufficiency issue removed need to address factual sufficiency of evidence).  That\r\nalternative is not presented here.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, we overrule Rosenblatt's sole issue. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>Conclusion</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe affirm the judgment of the trial court. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tSherry Radack</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tChief Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Panel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Jennings and Bland.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Rosenblatt's pleadings in the trial court named two additional defendants, National\r\nCare Marketing, Inc.  and Ascent Assurance, Inc.  Rosenblatt identified National Care\r\nMarketing, Inc. as the administrator of the Freedom Life policy and stated that Ascent\r\nAssurance, Inc. either owned or controlled both Freedom Life and National Care.  The\r\njury did not, however, determine the relationship, if any, between these entities, and\r\nthe judgment binds only Freedom Life.  Accordingly, we consider Freedom Life the\r\nsole appellee.\r\n</p><p>2. <em>See</em> Act of May 19, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 414, § 11, 1995 Tex. Gen.

This case\r\nis governed by the former statute, based on the date that Rosenblatt filed suit.\r\n</p><p>3. This rendition point was the only challenge to the verdict that Rosenblatt made in the\r\ntrial court.  He filed no motion for new trial or other motion that would preserve and\r\nthus authorize this Court to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand this\r\ncause to the trial court.  <em>See generally</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 324(b)(2)-(3); Tex. R. App. P.\r\n33.1(a)(1).  Rosenblatt has expressly limited this appeal; he seeks rendition only and\r\ndoes not wish a new trial.\r\n</p><p>4. During oral submission of this case on March 6, 2007, the Court announced its\r\nconcerns regarding the appellate record, as follows:  Rosenblatt had filed only a\r\npartial reporter's record, and the existing record did not demonstrate that Rosenblatt\r\nhad included \"a statement of the points or issues to be presented on appeal\" when he\r\nasked the court reporter to prepare the reporter's record.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P.\r\n34.6(c)(1) (\"Partial Reporter's Record\").  Rosenblatt has since filed a supplemental\r\nclerk's record that includes a certified copy of correspondence to the court reporter,\r\ndated February 13, 2006, from Rosenblatt's counsel, with copies to opposing counsel,\r\nin which Rosenblatt's counsel explained that,</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t[Rosenblatt] has requested only a partial Reporter's\r\nRecord, consisting of the testimony of Tracy Conwell,\r\n[Rosenblatt's] counsel, because [Rosenblatt] intends to assert on\r\nappeal only that the trial court's error [sic] in denying\r\n[Rosenblatt's] request to disregard the jury's finding of zero\r\nattorneys' fees and the trial court's refusal to award $500,000 in\r\nattorneys' fees, based on the uncontroverted testimony of\r\n[Rosenblatt's] counsel [sic].  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Rosenblatt thus complied with Tex. R. App. P. 34.6(c)(1), and because\r\nappellee, Freedom Life Insurance Company, has designated and filed an addition to\r\nthe reporter's record, <em>see id</em>. (c)(2), consisting of Rosenblatt's contingent-fee contract,\r\nwe must presume that the partial reporter's record before us constitutes the \"entire\"\r\nrecord for purposes of reviewing Rosenblatt's single issue challenging the sufficiency\r\nof the evidence.  <em>See id</em> (c)(4); John Hill Cayce, Jr., Anne Gardner &amp; Felicia Harris\r\nKyle, <em>Civil Appeals in Texas: Practicing Under the New Rules of Appellate\r\nProcedure</em>, 49 Baylor L.

Rosenblatt contends that an award of $500,000 in attorneys'\r\nfees was proper, notwithstanding the jury's verdict, and contends that we are\r\ncompelled to render judgment in his favor as a matter of law, because (1) he was\r\nstatutorily entitled to attorneys' fees and (2) the evidence supporting his request for\r\nattorneys' fees is uncontroverted.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 301 (authorizing judgment\r\nnotwithstanding verdict).  Because Rosenblatt seeks only rendition, and not a remand\r\nfor trial, we conclude there is no reversible error and affirm.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>Background</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRosenblatt is a former agent for appellee, Freedom Life Insurance Company\r\nof America.<sup> (1)</sup>  After sustaining injuries in a July 1999 automobile accident, Rosenblatt\r\nasserted claims for healthcare benefits from Freedom Life.  Rosenblatt sued Freedom\r\nLife, seeking damages for the company's delays in investigating his claims and in\r\npaying him compensation.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRosenblatt filed suit on September 1, 2001 and amended his pleadings six\r\ntimes to assert varied common-law theories and multiple claims under the Insurance\r\nCode and the Deceptive Trade and Consumer Practices Act.  Freedom Life obtained\r\na partial summary judgment that narrowed these claims before the seven-day trial\r\nbegan, and the disputed issues narrowed further during trial.  The case was ultimately\r\nsubmitted to the jury on Rosenblatt's common-law claim for bad faith and his claim\r\nthat Freedom Life violated former article 21.21, section 4(10)(a)(v)(A) of the\r\nInsurance Code and committed an unfair settlement practice by failing to affirm or\r\ndeny coverage within a reasonable time.<sup> (2)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury rejected Rosenblatt's common-law claim, but found, in response to\r\nthe Insurance Code question, that Freedom Life \"fail[ed] to affirm or deny coverage\r\nof a claim within a reasonable time.\"  The jury awarded Rosenblatt $10,000 in\r\ndamages for future physical impairment and $20,000 for conduct committed\r\nknowingly.  The jury awarded no damages for past and future mental anguish,\r\nphysical pain, medical bills, and past physical impairment.  In addition, and as\r\nchallenged here, the jury awarded no (\"zero\") damages, in response to a three-pronged question concerning attorneys' fees, for trial, appeal to this Court, and appeal\r\nto the Supreme Court of Texas.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter denying motions to disregard the jury's findings filed by both parties, the\r\ntrial court rendered judgment for Rosenblatt for $10,000 for future damages and\r\n$20,000 in additional damages, plus interest and costs.  Rosenblatt did not file a\r\nmotion for new trial.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>Legal Sufficiency Challenge to \"Zero\" Damages for Attorneys' Fees</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his sole issue on appeal, Rosenblatt contends he is entitled to judgment as\r\na matter of law because no evidence supports the jury's failure to award any damages\r\nin response to the question concerning attorneys' fees.  Rosenblatt preserved this\r\nissue for appeal through his motion to disregard the jury's failure to award any\r\namount for attorneys' fees at trial.  In the motion, as here, Rosenblatt argued that the\r\ntrial court was compelled to disregarded the jury's zero findings and to render\r\njudgment for statutorily authorized attorneys' fees of $500,000.<sup> (3)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A.\tStandard of Review</strong> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court may disregard a jury's verdict and render judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict pursuant to rule 301 if no evidence supports the jury's\r\nfindings or if a directed verdict would have been proper.  <em>Tiller v.

Conwell did not\r\nperform a step-by-step calculation of a total amount from the terms and percentages\r\nstated in the contract, but invited the jury to make the calculation.  As this Court\r\nrecognized recently, if a party presents evidence of <em>both</em> a fixed amount as a\r\nreasonable attorneys' fee and a contingency-fee contract that results in a lesser fee\r\nand claims that the contract was reasonable and that the jury could rely on either\r\ncalculation, that party may not argue on appeal that the evidence attesting to the\r\nreasonableness of the higher amount is uncontroverted.  <em>Tex.

She not only testified that\r\nher evidence suggested an award for attorneys' fees \"in the neighborhood of\r\n$400,000, maybe $350,000,\" but also acknowledged that her contingency-fee contract\r\ncould be interpreted as resulting in the significantly lesser sum of 40 percent of\r\nRosenblatt's total recovery, or $12,000.  In other testimony, Conwell estimated her\r\npersonal total time at 997 hours at $250 per hour, which results in yet another\r\ncalculation of approximately $250,000, to which was to be added her law clerks' fees,\r\nwhich Conwell \"guess[ed] a reaonable rate would be anywhere between [$]25 and\r\n$75 an hour,\" though she also invited the jury to \"figure out a reasonable rate.\" \r\nAdding the law clerks' fees to the $250,000 and calculating them in accordance with\r\nthe range Conwell suggested results in yet another total, with an approximate high of\r\n$340,000 and a low of $287,000. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConwell also testified that the $500,000 estimate included \"over\" $100,000 in\r\nexpenses.  But the trial court sustained Freedom Life's objections to several items\r\nlisted as expenses on the grounds that they were not recoverable.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Conwell's own testimony provided alternatives to the $500,000\r\namount that she opined was a reasonable fee and because her proposed amounts\r\nincluded nonrecoverable costs, we cannot agree that her testimony on the $500,000\r\namount was uncontroverted.  To the contrary, Conwell's testimony that $500,000 was\r\na reasonable award for attorneys' fees was both controvertible and controverted--by\r\nConwell.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>2.\t<em>Clear, Positive, Direct, and Free from Inconsistencies?</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConwell's testimony as to the varying amounts and calculations, described\r\nabove, conflicts with and contradicts the $500,000 ceiling amount and is thus\r\ninconsistent with a clearly demonstrated award of $500,000.  Moreover, Conwell\r\nacknowledged that her figures were estimates and invited the jurors to \"figure a\r\nreasonable fee,\" stating that she \"was not going to add it up\" for them.  Conwell also\r\nconceded under cross-examination that only \"some\" of the attorney time recorded in\r\nher entries had been entered contemporaneously.  She had constructed the remainder\r\nfrom estimates.  Conwell's inconsistencies, estimates, and equivocation render her\r\ntestimony less than clear, positive, and direct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>3.\t<em>Free of Circumstances that Tend to Discredit or Impeach?</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs shown above, Freedom Life successfully impeached Conwell's testimony\r\nthat $500,000 was a reasonable attorneys' fee for this case, first  by cross-examination\r\nof Conwell to emphasize that her calculations were estimates reconstructed from\r\nhindsight, and then by successfully objecting to recovery of certain costs and\r\nexpenses. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe note as well that over the five years that Conwell spent preparing this case,\r\nthe claims asserted against Freedom Life on Rosenblatt's behalf reduced significantly,\r\nwith but two theories ultimately submitted to the jury.  According to Conwell, it was\r\nnecessary for her to do as much work as she did because of the difficulty in\r\nascertaining what Freedom Life did and how Freedom Life did it.  She would \"need\r\nto do it all,\" she claimed, \"whether suing for bad faith or 21.55 or 21.21 because those\r\nclaims are so intertwined that [she could not] separate them.\"  <em>See C.M.

These claims were for\r\nunfair settlement practices; deceptive trade practices, including claims for\r\nunconscionable conduct and for conspiracy to violate the deceptive trade statue; and\r\nstatutory libel.

It is rationally to be anticipated that a jury that\r\nexamines a charge with only two liability questions and awards damages for only one\r\nof these would discredit evidence that attempted to recover an award for attorneys'\r\nfees for claims that the jury was not asked to decide.  <em>See Cordova v.

That\r\nalternative is not presented here.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, we overrule Rosenblatt's sole issue. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong>Conclusion</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe affirm the judgment of the trial court. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tSherry Radack</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\tChief Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Panel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Jennings and Bland.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Rosenblatt's pleadings in the trial court named two additional defendants, National\r\nCare Marketing, Inc.  and Ascent Assurance, Inc.  Rosenblatt identified National Care\r\nMarketing, Inc. as the administrator of the Freedom Life policy and stated that Ascent\r\nAssurance, Inc. either owned or controlled both Freedom Life and National Care.  The\r\njury did not, however, determine the relationship, if any, between these entities, and\r\nthe judgment binds only Freedom Life.  Accordingly, we consider Freedom Life the\r\nsole appellee.\r\n</p><p>2. <em>See</em> Act of May 19, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 414, § 11, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 2988,\r\n2999, <em>repealed by </em>Act of May 22, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 1274, § 26(a)(1), 2003\r\nTex. Gen. Laws 3611, 3662 (effective April 1, 2005), (recodified without substantive\r\nrevision at Tex. Ins. Code Ann. § 541.060(a)(4) (Vernon Supp. 2006)).  This case\r\nis governed by the former statute, based on the date that Rosenblatt filed suit.\r\n</p><p>3. This rendition point was the only challenge to the verdict that Rosenblatt made in the\r\ntrial court.  He filed no motion for new trial or other motion that would preserve and\r\nthus authorize this Court to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand this\r\ncause to the trial court.  <em>See generally</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 324(b)(2)-(3); Tex. R. App. P.\r\n33.1(a)(1).  Rosenblatt has expressly limited this appeal; he seeks rendition only and\r\ndoes not wish a new trial.\r\n</p><p>4. During oral submission of this case on March 6, 2007, the Court announced its\r\nconcerns regarding the appellate record, as follows:  Rosenblatt had filed only a\r\npartial reporter's record, and the existing record did not demonstrate that Rosenblatt\r\nhad included \"a statement of the points or issues to be presented on appeal\" when he\r\nasked the court reporter to prepare the reporter's record.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P.\r\n34.6(c)(1) (\"Partial Reporter's Record\").  Rosenblatt has since filed a supplemental\r\nclerk's record that includes a certified copy of correspondence to the court reporter,\r\ndated February 13, 2006, from Rosenblatt's counsel, with copies to opposing counsel,\r\nin which Rosenblatt's counsel explained that,</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t[Rosenblatt] has requested only a partial Reporter's\r\nRecord, consisting of the testimony of Tracy Conwell,\r\n[Rosenblatt's] counsel, because [Rosenblatt] intends to assert on\r\nappeal only that the trial court's error [sic] in denying\r\n[Rosenblatt's] request to disregard the jury's finding of zero\r\nattorneys' fees and the trial court's refusal to award $500,000 in\r\nattorneys' fees, based on the uncontroverted testimony of\r\n[Rosenblatt's] counsel [sic].  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tBecause Rosenblatt thus complied with Tex. R. App. P. 34.6(c)(1), and because\r\nappellee, Freedom Life Insurance Company, has designated and filed an addition to\r\nthe reporter's record, <em>see id</em>. (c)(2), consisting of Rosenblatt's contingent-fee contract,\r\nwe must presume that the partial reporter's record before us constitutes the \"entire\"\r\nrecord for purposes of reviewing Rosenblatt's single issue challenging the sufficiency\r\nof the evidence.  <em>See id</em> (c)(4); John Hill Cayce, Jr., Anne Gardner &amp; Felicia Harris\r\nKyle, <em>Civil Appeals in Texas: Practicing Under the New Rules of Appellate\r\nProcedure</em>, 49 Baylor L. Rev. 867, 922, 925-26 (1997). \r\n<p>5. Act of May 19, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 414, § 11, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 2988,\r\n3000, <em>repealed by </em>Act of May 22, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 1274, § 26(a)(1), 2003\r\nTex. Gen.
