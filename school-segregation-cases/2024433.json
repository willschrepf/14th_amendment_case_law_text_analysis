Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761,  764 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1996).  In July of 1995, a sixteen-year-old acquaintance\r\n\nof Cardoza, Myron Ragsdale, asked Cardoza to secure a handgun\r\n\nfor him to purchase.  Cardoza found a dealer willing to  sell\r\n\na  nine-millimeter  semiautomatic  handgun  to  Ragsdale  for\r\n\n$200.00.  On the night of July 14, 1995, Cardoza and Ragsdale\r\n\nwent to Walnut  Park in Roxbury,  Massachusetts, to make  the\r\n\ngun purchase.  Ragsdale paid $200.00 for the handgun and nine\r\n\nrounds  of ammunition.   Ragsdale  loaded the gun  with eight\r\n\nrounds  of ammunition,  and Cardoza  took  possession of  the\r\n\nninth round.\r\n\n          Sometime  after  the   transaction  was  completed,\r\n\nCardoza and Ragsdale began walking along Humboldt Avenue.  As\r\n\nthey walked,  Ragsdale had the  handgun in his  waistband and\r\n\nCardoza  carried the single round of  ammunition in his hand.\r\n\nBy this time it was approximately 2:00 a.m. on the morning of\r\n\nJuly 15.  They were  spotted walking along Humboldt Avenue by\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nfour  officers of the  Boston Police's Youth  Violence Strike\r\n\nForce who were patrolling the area in an unmarked police car.\r\n\nOne of the  officers in the car, Gregory  Brown, noticed that\r\n\nCardoza and  Ragsdale were acting  indecisively about whether\r\n\nto continue walking up Humboldt, or instead cross  the street\r\n\nin front  of the police  car.  Moving slowly,  the police car\r\n\napproached Cardoza and Ragsdale from  behind.  As the  patrol\r\n\ncar approached, Cardoza and  Ragsdale crossed Humboldt Avenue\r\n\nin order to walk up the sidewalk of Ruthven Street, a one-way\r\n\nthoroughfare  that emptied  onto Humboldt  Avenue.   As  they\r\n\ncrossed in front  of the car, Officer Brown,  who was sitting\r\n\nin the back seat on the driver's side, recognized Cardoza and\r\n\ndirected the  driver to  make a left  turn off  Humboldt, and\r\n\nproceed the  wrong  way  up  Ruthven for  a  short  distance.\r\n\nOfficer Brown testified  that he wanted  to ask Cardoza  some\r\n\nquestions concerning a  shooting incident  that had  occurred\r\n\nsome days earlier.  The driver took the left turn, and pulled\r\n\nover to the curb just  off Humboldt, facing the wrong  way on\r\n\nRuthven Street.\r\n\n          Officer Brown, whose window was rolled down, called\r\n\nout  to Cardoza,  asking \"What's  up Freddie?   What  are you\r\n\ndoing out this time of  night?\"  Cardoza stopped, turned, and\r\n\napproached  the patrol  car.   Ragsdale  continued walking  a\r\n\nshort distance.  Officer Brown remained in the car conversing\r\n\nwith Cardoza through the open car window.   As he talked with\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nOfficer  Brown, Cardoza  began  to  gesture  with  his  hand,\r\n\nexposing  the  round of  ammunition.    Seeing the  round  of\r\n\nammunition, Brown exited  the patrol car,  and began to  pat-\r\n\nfrisk Cardoza.   At the same time, two  other officers exited\r\n\nthe  car and approached and pat-frisked Ragsdale, discovering\r\n\nthe handgun loaded with eight rounds of ammunition.\r\n\n          Cardoza  was  indicted  on four  counts.    Count I\r\n\ncharged Cardoza with being a felon-in-possession of one round\r\n\nof ammunition, in violation of  18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).  Count\r\n\nII  charged Cardoza under  the same statutory  provision with\r\n\nbeing a  felon-in-possession of  the semi-automatic  firearm,\r\n\nbased on  his alleged  possession of the  weapon for  a short\r\n\nperiod  of time  after the  transaction.   Count III  charged\r\n\nCardoza with  causing the sale,  delivery, and transfer  of a\r\n\nhandgun  to  a juvenile  in  violation of  the  Youth Handgun\r\n\nSafety Act, codified at 18 U.S.C.   922(x).  Count IV charged\r\n\nCardoza with aiding and abetting a juvenile in the possession\r\n\nof a handgun  in violation of  the same.   A jury returned  a\r\n\nguilty verdict  on Counts  I, III, and  IV, and  acquitted on\r\n\nCount  II.    Following  the   jury  verdict,  but  prior  to\r\n\nsentencing, the district court  issued a memorandum detailing\r\n\nits refusal to grant both Cardoza's motion to dismiss and his\r\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal.  United States  v. Cardoza,\r                                                                        \r\n\n914  F.  Supp. 683  (D.  Mass.  1996).   The  district  court\r\n\nsentenced  Cardoza  under  the Guidelines  to  235  months of\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nimprisonment  and five  years of  supervised  release.   This\r\n\nappeal followed.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n                 The Meaning of \"Ammunition\"\r                             The Meaning of \"Ammunition\"\r\n\n          Cardoza launches  his appeal  by  arguing that  the\r\n\nsingle  nine  millimeter  bullet which  he  was  convicted of\r\n\npossessing  is  not  \"ammunition\" within  the  meaning  of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   922(g).  We disagree.\r\n\n          Cardoza was  convicted of  violating the  felon-in-\r\n\npossession  statute, which makes  it illegal for  a convicted\r\n\nfelon \"to  possess in or  affecting commerce, any  firearm or\r\n\nammunition . .  . .\"  18 U.S.C    922(g)(1)(West Supp. 1997).\r\n\n\"Ammunition\" is  defined as  \"ammunition or cartridge  cases,\r\n\nprimers,  bullets, or propellent  powder designed for  use in\r\n\nany  firearm.\"  18  U.S.C.   921(a)(17)(A)(West  Supp. 1997).\r\n\nCardoza  suggests  first that  the  statutory  definition, by\r\n\nincluding  the plural words  \"cases, primers,  [and] bullets\"\r\n\nbans  only  the  possession   of  more  than  one   piece  of\r\n\nammunition.  Second,  he suggests that the  word \"ammunition\"\r\n\nitself always means multiple rounds.  Finally, Cardoza argues\r\n\nthat the definition of \"ammunition\" is sufficiently ambiguous\r\n\nto require application of the \"rule of lenity,\" United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Lanier, 117 S. Ct. 1219,  1225 (1997), in his favor.   The\r                     \r\n\ncourt below  determined that  \"[n]o amount  of wordplay  will\r\n\ncontradict  the plain  meaning  of  the  statute,  an  honest\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nreading  of which leads  to the inexorable  conclusion that a\r\n\nsingle  nine millimeter bullet  . . .  constitutes ammunition\r\n\nfor the purposes of [ 922 (g)(1)].\"  Cardoza, 914 F. Supp. at\r                                                        \r\n\n686-87. \r\n\n          This question  is  one  of  statutory  construction\r\n\nwhich  we review de novo.   Strickland v. Commissioner, Maine\r                                                                         \r\n\nDep't of Human Servs., 96 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir. 1996).   In\r                                 \r\n\nthis instance,  we need not  venture far beyond the  words of\r\n\nthe statute.  \r\n\n           We think the  common sense, everyday understanding\r\n\nof  the  word  \"ammunition\" encompasses  a  single  bullet or\r\n\ncartridge. See O'Connell  v. Shalala, 79  F.3d 170, 176  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1996) (\"courts are bound to afford statutes a practical,\r\n\ncommonsense  reading\").     Thus   courts,  and   the  public\r\n\ngenerally, refer  to ammunition  in terms  of \"rounds.\"   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States  v.

If the word \"ammunition\"\r\n\nwas incapable of meaning one bullet, one would not refer to a\r\n\n\"single round of ammunition.\"1 \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We  note that even the Supreme  Court has assumed, albeit\r\nin dicta, that  the term \"ammunition\" means a  single bullet.\r\nSee United  States  v.  Batchelder, 442  U.S.  114,  121  n.7\r                                              \r\n(1979)(\"[B]ecause     922(h)  alone  proscribes  receipt   of\r\nammunition,  a felon  who  obtained  a  single  bullet  could\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          To  hold otherwise  would result  in an  absurdity.\r\n\nMarques  v.

It  would\r                        \r\n\ntherefore   make  little  sense  to  interpret     922(g)  to\r\n\ncriminalize  possession of  two bullets,  but  not one,  when\r\n\nCongress'  purpose  was  to deprive  certain  persons  of any\r\n\nfirepower. \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                The Interstate Commerce Nexus\r                            The Interstate Commerce Nexus\r\n\n          Cardoza next assigns error to the  district court's\r\n\nfailure to dismiss  the indictment, arguing that  the Supreme\r\n\nCourt's  decision in  United States  v.

As  an initial matter we  find that\r                 \r\n\nthe  YHSA is a regulation  of economic activity.   This is so\r\n\nbecause it  prohibits expressly commercial  activity, namely,\r\n\nthe sale, transfer, or delivery of handguns to juveniles.  It\r\n\ntherefore  stands   in  direct  opposition   to  the  statute\r\n\ninvalidated in Lopez, which \"by its terms ha[d] nothing to do\r                                \r\n\nwith 'commerce'  or any sort of economic  enterprise . . . .\"\r\n\nId. at 561.  \r               \r\n\n          Similarly,  we think  the possessory  prong of  the\r\n\nYHSA,  under  which  Cardoza  was  convicted  of  aiding  and\r\n\nabetting, is  \"an essential  part of  a larger regulation  of\r\n\neconomic  activity, in which  the regulatory scheme  could be\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nundercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nThis is so because the YHSA was designed expressly to \"stop[]\r\n\nthe commerce in  handguns with juveniles nationwide .  . . .\"\r\n\nH.R.

Part of this  regulatory approach\r\n\ninvolves the  suppression of  the demand  for such  handguns.\r\n\nThe  YHSA can  be thus  seen  as criminalization  of the  two\r\n\npoints where  the prohibited  commerce finds  its nexus;  the\r\n\ndemand  for  the  firearms  (possession),  and  the  sale  or\r\n\ntransfer  designed to meet that demand.  The two prohibitions\r\n\ngo hand in hand  with one another.  Invalidation of  one half\r\n\nof the equation would likely have deleterious effects on  the\r\n\nefficacy of  the legislation.   In this  regard, we  think it\r\n\nclear that given  Congress' express purpose, its  decision to\r\n\npunish   both  the  supply  (sale  or  transfer)  and  demand\r\n\n(possession)  sides of  the  market  is  a  means  reasonably\r\n\ncalculated to achieve its end.

Assuming, then, for purposes\r\n\nof this  appeal, that  the regulated  activity occurs  solely\r\n\nintrastate,  we  must  now  pass  on  whether  this  activity\r\n\n\"substantially affects\" interstate  commerce.  We turn  first\r\n\nto the legislative  findings on the matter.   Lopez, 514 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 562  (\"we of  course consider legislative  findings .  . .\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nregarding effect on interstate commerce . . . .\").

Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, at 390 (1994), reprinted in 1994\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 1858, Congress  found that \"it is  necessary and\r\n\nappropriate  to assist  the States  in  controlling crime  by\r\n\nstopping the commerce in handguns with juveniles nationwide .\r\n\n.  .  .\"   Id.  at  391,  1994 U.S.C.C.A.N.  at  1859.   This\r                          \r\n\nindicates  that  Congress  determined  that  the  market  for\r\n\nhandguns among juveniles was national.   We do not think this\r\n\nobservation can be seriously disputed.  As the court in Rybar\r                                                                         \r\n\nconcluded,  \"[c]ongressional  findings  generated  throughout\r\n\nCongress' history of  firearms regulation link both  the flow\r\n\nof  firearms  across  state  lines  and  their  consequential\r\n\nindiscriminate  availability   with  the   resulting  violent\r\n\ncriminal  acts that are  beyond the effective  control of the\r\n\nstate.\"  103 F.3d at 279.  \r\n\n          The  answer,  therefore, to  whether  an intrastate\r\n\nmarket in handguns for  juveniles \"substantially affects\" the\r\n\ninterstate market  in such  commodities is  obvious.   Simply\r\n\nput,  the  handgun must  come  from somewhere,  often  out of\r\n\nstate.  Indeed, it is worth noting here  that even though the\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nYHSA  does not require it, the government introduced evidence\r\n\nat trial  that the  handgun transferred  to Ragsdale  had, in\r\n\nfact, been  manufactured outside  Massachusetts.   Therefore,\r\n\nthe supply  and demand for  handguns in any given  state will\r\n\n\"substantially  affect\" interstate  commerce  in handguns  by\r\n\ncausing the weapons to move across state lines.  \r\n\n          In  Lopez,  the  Court  examined  its  decision  in\r                               \r\n\nWickard  v.

Still, Chief  Justice Rehnquist\r                 \r\n\nquoted with  approval the Wickard analysis that  \"a factor of\r                                             \r\n\nsuch volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have\r\n\na substantial influence on price and market conditions.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat  560 (quoting  Wickard, 317  U.S. at 128).

Cardoza  suggests that because the  police admitted\r\n\nthat they did  not have reasonable and  articulable suspicion\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nto  \"Terry-stop\" Cardoza, discovery of the bullet flowed from\r\n\nan  unreasonable seizure,  and thus  must be  excluded.

Because  we agree that  there was  no \"seizure\"\r\n\nwithin the  meaning of the  Fourth Amendment at the  time the\r\n\npolice officer saw  the bullet in  Cardoza's hand, we  uphold\r\n\nthe lower court's denial of Cardoza's suppression motion.\r\n\n          Our  review  of   a  lower  court's  denial   of  a\r\n\nsuppression motion  is bifurcated.

As we stated\r                               \r\n\nin  Young, this deference  to the lower  court's fact finding\r                     \r\n\n\"reflects our  awareness that the  trial judge . .  . sits in\r\n\nthe best position to determine what  actually happened.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nConversely,  we review conclusions of law de novo, subjecting\r\n\nconstitutional  interpretations  to  plenary  review.

The record demonstrates that portions of\r                              \r\n\nthe  police officer's  as well  as  Cardoza's and  Ragsdale's\r\n\ntestimony were credited in making the findings.   The court's\r\n\nfindings of fact are supported by the evidence, United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Sealey, 30 F.3d  7, 8 (1st  Cir. 1994), and  we detect no\r                      \r\n\nerror.  \r\n\n          Turning  to  the court's  rulings  of  law, Cardoza\r\n\nargues that because  the court stated at the  hearing that in\r\n\nthe absence of a response  from Cardoza, \"the police officers\r\n\nwould have run  them down,\" the court was  in essence finding\r\n\nthat  Cardoza was  seized by  the time  the bullet  was seen.\r\n\nAlthough  the lower court's  legal conclusions on  the Fourth\r\n\nAmendment  issue lack the precision and clarity desirable for\r\n\nappellate  review,  we think  Cardoza's argument  ignores the\r\n\nentirety of the court's  reasoning in favor of an  irrelevant\r\n\naside.  Reading the   findings in total, it is  apparent that\r\n\nthe  court determined  that there  was  no \"stop\"  within the\r\n\nmeaning of  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S.  1 (1968).  Our reasoning\r                                     \r\n\nis  as follows.   The  court found  that prior to  seeing the\r\n\nbullet in his  hand, the police  had no  basis upon which  to\r\n\nconstitutionally detain Mr. Cardoza.   Yet it went on to hold\r\n\nthat  the interaction between  Officer Brown and  Cardoza was\r\n\n\"lawful,\" and provided no grounds  upon which to exclude  the\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nevidence.  Under current  Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the\r\n\nonly way  the district court  could have determined  that the\r\n\ninteraction was lawful (here meaning constitutional) and also\r\n\nhold that there  was no reasonable and  articulable suspicion\r\n\nupon which to  detain Cardoza, was for it to  decide that the\r\n\npolice were  not detaining,  or seizing,  Cardoza within  the\r\n\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment.4  We conclude therefore that\r\n\nthe  court below  determined  that there  was  no seizure  of\r\n\nCardoza prior to  Officer Brown's sighting  of the bullet  in\r\n\nCardoza's hand.    See  McCarthy,  77  F.3d  at  525  (\"Where\r                                            \r\n\nspecific  findings are  lacking, we  view the  record in  the\r\n\nlight most  favorable to  the ruling,  making all  reasonably\r\n\nsupported inferences.\").\r\n\n          We now  turn to  the gravamen  of Cardoza's  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment  argument,  namely,  whether  the district  court's\r\n\ndetermination that there  was no seizure was correct.   To be\r\n\nsure, \"not  all  personal intercourse  between policemen  and\r\n\ncitizens involves 'seizures' of persons.\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at\r                                                            \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The government  also suggests  that because  the district\r\ncourt  inferred  that  Cardoza  deliberately  approached  the\r\ncruiser in order to throw  the police off Ragsdale, there was\r\nno \"submission  to\"  a police  show of  authority within  the\r\nmeaning of California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 626 (1991),\r                                              \r\nbecause of the fact that Cardoza's actions were motivated not\r\nby  acquiescence to  a  police request,  but  rather his  own\r\nstrategic decision.  We  note only that, given  the generally\r\nobjective standards  employed  in  Fourth  Amendment  seizure\r\nanalysis,  we would  see little  reason  to inquire  into the\r\nsubjective intent of the detainee in making the determination\r\nwhether  or  not he  or  she  has \"submitted  to\"  a show  of\r\nauthority.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n19  n.16.   Instead, \"[i]nteraction  between law  enforcement\r\n\nofficials  and citizens generally falls within three tiers of\r\n\nFourth Amendment analysis,  depending on the level  of police\r\n\nintrusion into  a person's privacy.\"   Young, 105 F.3d  at 5.\r                                                        \r\n\nThe first  tier \"encompasses  interaction  of such  minimally\r\n\nintrusive nature that  it does not trigger the protections of\r\n\nthe Fourth Amendment.\"  Id.  It has therefore been recognized\r                                       \r\n\nthat police  officers may approach citizens in public and ask\r\n\nquestions  without  the  need  for articulable  suspicion  of\r\n\ncriminal  activity.

It is therefore the case that, \r\n\n          in   order   to   determine   whether   a\r\n          particular   encounter    constitutes   a\r\n          seizure,  a court  must consider  all the\r\n          circumstances  surrounding  the encounter\r\n          to determine  whether the  police conduct\r\n          would have  communicated to  a reasonable\r\n          person that  the person was  not free  to\r\n          decline   the   officers'   requests   or\r\n          otherwise terminate the encounter.  \r\n\nBostick, 501 U.S.  at 439.

In doing so we have\r                                   \r\n\nhad the recent opportunity to examine the existence of Fourth\r\n\nAmendment seizures under facts remarkably similar to the case\r\n\nat hand.  Thus,  in Young we found no seizure  where a police\r                                     \r\n\ncruiser   \"pulled   alongside   [defendant],   the   officers\r\n\nidentified themselves  as Boston  Police officers,  and asked\r\n\n'got a  minute' to  which [defendant]  replied 'sure.'\"   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nSimilarly, in Sealey, there was no Fourth Amendment violation\r                                \r\n\nwhere police officers  in a cruiser approached  the defendant\r\n\nand yelled  \"Hey Stephen,  what's up?\"  before the  defendant\r\n\ntook  flight.   30 F.3d  at  8, 10.   In  each  instance, our\r\n\ndetermination  was informed by  the observation that  \"in the\r\n\nabsence of  an officer's  exertion  of physical  force or  an\r\n\nindividual's  submission to a  show of authority,  no seizure\r\n\noccurs.\"  Young, 105 F.3d at 6; Sealey, 30 F.3d at 10.\r                                                  \r\n\n          Cardoza  focuses  our  attention  on several  facts\r\n\nparticular  to his situation that ostensibly compel a holding\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ncontrary to Young  and Sealey.  First, the  question posed to\r                                         \r\n\nhim,  \"Why  are  you out  at  this  time of  night?\"  is more\r\n\ndemanding and pointed an inquiry than the generalized queries\r\n\nat issue  in Young  and Sealey.   Second, the  police cruiser\r                                          \r\n\nturned the wrong  way up a one-way street, albeit  for a very\r\n\nshort  distance, making clear the officer's intention to come\r\n\ninto  contact with Cardoza.   Finally, Cardoza  adds that his\r\n\npast interactions  with the same  officer led him  to believe\r\n\nthat he was not free to leave at the time he was called over.\r\n\nAlthough  each of  these facts  distinguishes  his case  from\r\n\nYoung and  Sealey, our  job in  identifying whether  a Fourth\r                             \r\n\nAmendment seizure has  occurred is not  absolutely controlled\r\n\nby the  traditional operation of factually similar precedent.\r\n\nThis is so because no two police-citizen encounters will ever\r\n\nbe   completely  identical.      We   therefore  reject   the\r\n\ngovernment's assertion that  Young dispositively controls the\r                                              \r\n\noutcome  of   this  appeal.    Instead,  \"we  adhere  to  our\r\n\ntraditional contextual approach, and determine only that,  in\r\n\nthis  particular case, the police conduct in question did not\r\n\namount to a  seizure.\"  Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 573.  We make\r                                              \r\n\nthis determination  in the  instant case  because the  police\r\n\nconduct at  issue was  not a \"show  of authority\"  within the\r\n\nmeaning  of Fourth Amendment  jurisprudence.  Hodari  D., 499\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. at 625-29.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          As the Court  observed in Hodari D., \"the  test for\r                                                         \r\n\nexistence of a  'show of authority' is an  objective one: not\r\n\nwhether the citizen  perceived that he  was being ordered  to\r\n\nrestrict  his movement, but  whether the officer's  words and\r\n\nactions would  have conveyed  that to  a reasonable  person.\"\r\n\nId. at 628.  Similarly, it was noted in Chesternut that\r                                                              \r\n\n          [t]he  test  is   necessarily  imprecise,\r\n          because  it  is  designed  to assess  the\r\n          coercive effect of  police conduct, taken\r\n          as a  whole,  rather  than  to  focus  on\r\n          particular  details  of that  conduct  in\r\n          isolation.  Moreover,  what constitutes a\r\n          restraint on  liberty prompting  a person\r\n          to  conclude  that  he  is  not  free  to\r\n          \"leave\" will  vary,  not  only  with  the\r\n          particular police  conduct at  issue, but\r\n          also  with  the  setting   in  which  the\r\n          conduct occurs.\r\n\n486 U.S. at 573.   \r\n\n          Our inquiry is  not directed at whether  the police\r\n\nconduct  objectively communicated  police desire to  speak to\r                                                                      \r\n\nCardoza, or ask  him a question.5  Rather,  we must determine\r                                           \r\n\nwhether their  conduct indicated  that they  were interfering\r\n\nwith his liberty  to such an extent  that he was not  free to\r                            \r\n\nleave.   We think  the distinction  important, and are  left,\r\n\ntherefore, with  the  conclusion that  the  police  officers'\r\n\nconduct on  the night in question would not have communicated\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Indeed, it  would appear that  this is  exactly what  the\r\ndistrict court  was  referring  to  when  it  stated  at  the\r\nsuppression  hearing that  the police  \"intended  to exercise\r\ntheir authority at least to  bring themselves into a position\r\nto confront Mr. Cardoza.\"\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nto a  reasonable person  that the police  were attempting  to\r\n\n\"intrude upon [Cardoza's] freedom of movement.\"  Id. at 575.\r                                                                \r\n\n          To  begin with, no  sirens or flashing  lights were\r\n\nused by  the officers to  indicate to Cardoza that  he should\r\n\nstop in  his tracks.   Similarly, the  police cruiser  pulled\r\n\nover and stopped at the  curb before Officer Brown called out\r\n\nto Cardoza.  Compare Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 576 (short drive\r                                           \r\n\nalongside defendant  not \"so  intimidating\" as  to constitute\r\n\nseizure).   And  Officer Brown  remained in  the car  when he\r\n\ncalled  out to  Cardoza.   In total,  the encounter  does not\r\n\nobjectively communicate a \"restrain[t against] his freedom to\r\n\nwalk away . . . .\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 16.  Officer Brown did\r                                     \r\n\nnot  ask Cardoza to  stop, or even  to approach the  car.  He\r\n\nsimply  called  out  through  an  open  car  window with  the\r\n\nquestion  \"what are  you doing  out at  this time  of night?\"\r\n\nThose  words do  not objectively  communicate  an attempt  to\r\n\nrestrain Cardoza's  liberty.   We  are therefore  unpersuaded\r\n\nthat the  police officers' actions  transformed \"mere  police\r\n\nquestioning,\" Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434, into a seizure.   \r                                 \r\n\n          We recognize,  of course,  the import of  Cardoza's\r\n\nobservation that  few people,  including himself,  would ever\r\n\nfeel free to walk away from any  police question.  Under this\r\n\nreasoning,  however,  the  standard  reiterated  in   Bostick\r                                                                         \r\n\ntransforms every police-citizen encounter into a seizure. See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v. Tavolacci,  895 F.2d 1423,  1425 (D.C.

The \"free  to walk\r\n\naway\" test,  however, must  be read  in conjunction  with the\r\n\nCourt's frequent admonitions  that \"a seizure does  not occur\r\n\nsimply  because a police officer approaches an individual and\r\n\nasks a  few questions.\"  Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434; Terry, 392\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. at 19  n.16.  What emerges between  the two imperatives,\r\n\ntherefore,  is the directive that police conduct, viewed from\r\n\nthe   totality  of   the   circumstances,  must   objectively\r\n\ncommunicate  that  the  officer  is  exercising  his  or  her\r\n\nofficial  authority to  restrain the individual's  liberty of\r\n\nmovement  before  we  can  find  that  a  seizure  occurred.6\r\n\nBecause  there was  no such  objective  communication in  the\r\n\ninstant  case, we  affirm  the  district  court's  denial  of\r\n\nCardoza's motion to suppress.   \r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n                         The Sentence\r                                     The Sentence\r\n\n          Cardoza's final argument  posits that his 235-month\r\n\nsentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") and the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  As for Cardoza's contention  that the court's observation\r\nthat the police officers would have \"run them down\" compels a\r\ncontrary holding, he is  mistaken.  In determining  whether a\r\nseizure occurred, \"the  subjective intent of the  officers is\r\nrelevant   to   an  assessment   of   the   Fourth  Amendment\r\nimplications  of police conduct only  to the extent that that\r\nintent   has  been  conveyed   to  the   person  confronted.\"\r\nChesternut, 486 U.S. at 575 n.7.  \r                      \r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\") offends both\r\n\nthe  Eighth  Amendment's  proscriptions  against  cruel   and\r\n\nunusual  punishments and the  Fifth Amendment's guarantees of\r\n\ndue process.  \r\n\n          Cardoza  was  sentenced  under  the  Armed   Career\r\n\nCriminal   enhancement,   18   U.S.C.      924(e),   and  the\r\n\ncorresponding Guideline section, U.S.S.G    4B1.4, because he\r\n\nviolated the felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C.   922(g),\r\n\nand had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies\r\n\nwhich  had been  committed on  occasions  different from  one\r\n\nanother.   Cardoza's Pre-Sentence Report  (\"PSR\") contains  a\r\n\nrecord  of  four  violent  felonies  of  which  he  had  been\r\n\nconvicted, which are  described below, the facts  being drawn\r\n\nfrom the unobjected-to portions of the PSR.  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nVoccola, 99 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir. 1996).7 \r                   \r\n\n          On  June  27,   1988,  Cardoza  was  arrested   and\r\n\narraigned  for attempting to steal an automobile, assault and\r\n\nbattery of a police officer, receipt  of stolen property, and\r\n\npossession  of burglarious tools.   On February  13, 1989, he\r\n\nwas arrested and arraigned for stealing a woman's wallet at a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  We  briefly elaborate on  the facts  underlying Cardoza's\r\nfour  violent  felonies   not  because  the  facts   of  each\r\nconviction  are relevant  to  the sentencing  process itself.\r\nThey are not.  See United  States v. Damon, No. 97-1032, 1997\r                                                      \r\nWL  605196, at *7 (1st Cir.  Oct. 6, 1997)(\"Congress intended\r\nthat   the   Guidelines  take   a  categorical   approach  to\r\nsentencing.\").   Instead, we  provide a short  explication in\r\norder  to  refute  Cardoza's  contention  that  he  is  being\r\nsentenced solely for possession of a bullet.\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nlocal mall, possession of burglarious tools, and receipt of a\r\n\nstolen car which  he had attempted to use in his getaway.  On\r\n\nMarch  15, 1989, Cardoza and another individual were arrested\r\n\nfor armed robbery,  and assault and battery  with a dangerous\r\n\nweapon,  having  held  up an  individual  by  restraining the\r\n\nvictim  from behind  and holding  a  screwdriver against  the\r\n\nvictim's throat.  He was convicted of this latter offense and\r\n\nsentenced  on July 28, 1989, in Suffolk County Superior Court\r\n\nto twenty  years for  the armed robbery  count, two  years to\r\n\nserve,  and ten  years  on  the assault  and  battery with  a\r\n\ndangerous weapon count, one year  to serve.  He was convicted\r\n\nand sentenced on August 18, 1989, for the former two offenses\r\n\nin  Roxbury  District   Court  to  two  and   one-half  years\r\n\nincarceration  for each, sentences to run concurrent with the\r\n\nsentence  imposed in  Suffolk Superior  Court  for the  armed\r\n\nrobbery charge.  Cardoza was released from prison on June 10,\r\n\n1991.  \r\n\n          Less  than  four  months  after  his  release,   on\r\n\nOctober 2,  1991, he was  arrested with four  other men after\r\n\nthe car  in which they  were riding pulled up  beside another\r\n\nvehicle, a passenger in the car containing Cardoza pointed  a\r\n\nsemi-automatic weapon out  the window, and proceeded  to fire\r\n\nfour  rounds into the adjacent automobile.   He was convicted\r\n\nand  sentenced in Suffolk  County Superior Court  for assault\r\n\nwith a dangerous weapon, knowingly receiving stolen property,\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nand possession of a firearm.  He received three to five years\r\n\nincarceration.  Cardoza  was released on September  30, 1994.\r\n\nThe offenses for which he was convicted in the instant appeal\r\n\noccurred just over nine months later.\r\n\n          At sentencing, the government and Cardoza's counsel\r\n\nagreed  that the proper  sentence calculation under  the ACCA\r\n\nand U.S.S.G. was 235 to 293 months.  No argument was  made by\r\n\nCardoza's counsel to depart downward.8  Cardoza did, however,\r\n\npress  his constitutional arguments both in his objections to\r\n\nthe  PSR  and  at  the  disposition  hearing.    Cardoza  was\r\n\nsentenced to  235 months incarceration  on Count I,  one year\r\n\neach on Counts III and IV to  run concurrent with Count I and\r\n\neach other, and supervised release  of five years.  The court\r\n\nconcluded sentencing with the following statement:\r\n\n          I've given you the  most lenient sentence\r\n          that  I am  authorized to give  under the\r\n          law.  And  yet that lenient sentence,  at\r\n          least  given  what   discretion  I  have,\r\n          sentences  you to  prison  for nearly  20\r\n          years  of your  life.   And  the fact  is\r\n          that, . . . as you  were building up this\r\n          conviction    after   conviction    after\r\n          conviction after conviction  in the state\r\n          courts, with these short  sentences or no\r\n          sentences, you were laying the groundwork\r\n          for this  sentence which is  imposed upon\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  Cardoza notes in his brief his contention that several of\r\nhis convictions below were unconstitutionally obtained.   His\r\ncounsel conceded at the disposition hearing, however, that he\r\ncannot collaterally  attack these convictions  at sentencing.\r\nCustis  v.  United States,  511  U.S.  485,  497 (1994).  The\r                                     \r\ndistrict  court was  correct that  Cardoza may  return  to it\r\nshould a  subsequent constitutional attack  prove successful.\r\nUnited States v.

I  am required  to impose\r\n          this sentence  given the  legal framework\r\n          under which  we operate.

Michigan,  501 U.S.  957  (1991),  two justices\r                                  \r\n\nsought to limit proportionality review to capital cases only,\r\n\nid.  at  994 (opinion  of  Scalia, J.,  joined  by Rehnquist,\r               \r\n\nC.J.),  three justices  recognized a  \"narrow proportionality\r\n\nprinciple,\" id.  at 997  (opinion of  Kennedy, J.,  joined by\r                           \r\n\nO'Connor  and Souter, JJ.),  and three justices  dissented on\r\n\nthe grounds  that Helm's three-factor  proportionality review\r                                  \r\n\ncontrolled, id.  at 1021  (White, J.,  dissenting, joined  by\r                           \r\n\nBlackmun and Stevens,  JJ.).  We have interpreted Harmelin to\r                                                                      \r\n\nrequire  a   defendant  seeking  proportionality   review  to\r\n\ndemonstrate, at the threshold, an \"initial inference of gross\r\n\ndisproportionality,\" Tart  v.

Similarly, in\r\n\nSaccoccia we upheld a mandatory life sentence in a drug-money\r                     \r\n\nlaundering scheme, stating that\r\n\n          Congress  --  not  the  judiciary  --  is\r\n          vested with the authority  to define, and\r\n          attempt to  solve, the  societal problems\r\n          created   by   drug   trafficking  across\r\n          national and state borders.   The Supreme\r\n          Court has made  it plain that the  use of\r\n          severe   penalties   as   part   of   the\r\n          legislative   armamentarium   does    not\r\n          constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\r\n\n58 F.3d at 789.  \r\n\n          Against this backdrop, we cannot say that Cardoza's\r\n\nsentence   supports  the   necessary   \"inference  of   gross\r\n\ndisproportionality.\"   Bucuvalas, 970  F.2d at 946.   Cardoza\r                                            \r\n\nhas  not been sentenced  to a 235-month  incarceration solely\r\n\nbecause he was in possession of a single bullet, as his brief\r\n\nstrenuously argues.  Rather, he  has been sentenced to such a\r\n\nterm because  (1) he was  a convicted felon in  possession of\r\n\nthe bullet,  and (2) he  had previously been convicted  of at\r\n\nleast three violent  felonies.  Further, despite  counsel for\r\n\nappellant's position  at  oral argument,  a bullet  is not  a\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\n\"souvenir.\"   It  is a  live round  of ammunition  capable of\r\n\ndoing considerable  harm when fired  from a gun.   With those\r\n\nclarifications in mind,  the sentence imposed upon  him under\r\n\nthe  ACCA  recidivist  statute  does  not  give  rise  to  an\r\n\ninference  of  constitutional  infirmity.   As  we  stated in\r\n\nGilliard,\r                    \r\n\n               The purpose of  a recidivist statute\r\n          . .  . is  not to  simplify  the task  of\r\n          prosecutors,  judges  or   juries.    Its\r\n          primary   goals  are   to  deter   repeat\r\n          offenders and, at some point  in the life\r\n          of  one who  repeatedly commits  criminal\r\n          offenses serious enough to be punished as\r\n          felonies, to  segregate that  person from\r\n          the  rest  of  society  for  an  extended\r\n          period of  time.  . .  .   Like the  line\r\n          dividing felony theft from petty larceny,\r\n          the point at  which a recidivist will  be\r\n          deemed to have demonstrated the necessary\r\n          propensities and the amount  of time that\r\n          the  recidivist  will  be  isolated  from\r\n          society  are matters  largely within  the\r\n          discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.\r\n\n847 F.2d at 26 (quoting Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 284-\r                                                     \r\n\n85 (1980)).  While it may be the case that reasonable persons\r\n\nwill disagree as to the  wisdom of the policy choice inherent\r\n\nin  the  imposition   of  a  sentence  such  as   this,  such\r\n\ndisagreements  do not,  in  the instant  case,  give rise  to\r\n\nconstitutional concerns.      In  the  years   preceding  his\r\n\nconviction  below, Cardoza  had  racked  up  at  least  three\r\n\nconvictions  for  violent  felonies  in   the  state  courts.\r\n\nResponding  to  the  very  problem  presented   by  Cardoza's\r\n\nconduct, Congress decided to \"infuse federal law  enforcement\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\ninto efforts at  curbing and 'incapacitating''armed, habitual\r\n\n(career) criminals.'\"  Id.

United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Olano, 507  U.S. 725,  732 (1993).

Lombard, 72 F.3d  170 (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1995)(Lombard I).  There, we vacated a  sentence and remanded\r                         \r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\nbecause the district  court erroneously believed that  it had\r\n\nno  authority  to depart  downward,  despite  the substantial\r\n\neffect that consideration of previously acquitted conduct had\r\n\non Lombard's sentence.   Id. at 187.  We  were concerned that\r                                        \r\n\n\"the sentencing phase  of the defendant's trial  produced the\r\n\nconclusion he had committed murder and mandated imposition of\r\n\na life sentence,  but without the protections  which normally\r\n\nattend the criminal process, such as the requirement of proof\r\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Id. at 179-80.  Our decision was\r                                            \r\n\ncompelled by  both the  extreme facts  and the  determination\r\n\nthat the \"district  court did not recognize  its authority to\r\n\nconsider   whether  a  downward  departure  would  have  been\r\n\nappropriate . . . .\"   Id. at  187.  We were,  however, clear\r                                      \r\n\nthat Lombard I is \"an unusual and perhaps a singular case, at\r                        \r\n\nthe boundaries of constitutional sentencing law, and does not\r\n\nprovide an  open door.\"   Id.   Indeed, following  remand, we\r                                         \r\n\nupheld the  imposition of the  same life sentence,  after the\r\n\ndistrict  court recognized its authority to depart, and chose\r\n\nnot to exercise it.

Most   importantly,  the\r                   \r\n\nenhancement below  was  predicated on  convictions that  were\r\n\nobtained in state court, as opposed to  the uncharged, indeed\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nacquitted,  conduct enhancements at  play in Lombard  I.

In short,\r                                                           \r\n\nwe do  not think  this case  lies,  like Lombard  I, \"at  the\r                                                            \r\n\nboundaries of constitutional sentencing law . . . .\"  Lombard\r                                                                         \r\n\nI, 72 F.3d at 187.9  \r\n\n          Finally,  Cardoza   makes  three   brief  arguments\r\n\nconcerning  the  calculation  of his  criminal  history.   As\r\n\nCardoza himself recognizes, however, resolution of any errors\r\n\nwould not affect  his sentence.  We therefore  need not reach\r\n\nthem.    We note  only  that  should  Cardoza return  to  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  for  resentencing, see  supra  note  8, this\r                                                          \r\n\nopinion does not preclude him from raising, at that time, his\r\n\ncriminal history arguments.\r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r\n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons, the  convictions  and\r\n\nsentence below are affirmed.\r                               affirmed\r                                       \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  Cardoza also makes vague allusions in his brief to double\r\njeopardy and federalism concerns  attendant in his  sentence.\r\nThese  arguments are completely  undeveloped, and  are deemed\r\nwaived.

United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 764 (1st Cir.1996).  In July of 1995, a sixteen-year-old acquaintance of Cardoza, Myron Ragsdale, asked Cardoza to secure a handgun for him to purchase.  Cardoza found a dealer willing to sell a nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun to Ragsdale for $200.00.  On the night of July 14, 1995, Cardoza and Ragsdale went to Walnut Park in Roxbury, Massachusetts, to make the gun purchase.  Ragsdale paid $200.00 for the handgun and nine rounds of ammunition.  Ragsdale loaded the gun with eight rounds of ammunition, and Cardoza took possession of the ninth round.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime after the transaction was completed, Cardoza and Ragsdale began walking along Humboldt Avenue.  As they walked, Ragsdale had the handgun in his waistband and Cardoza carried the single round of ammunition in his hand.  By this time it was approximately 2:00 a.m.  on the morning of July 15.  They were spotted walking along Humboldt Avenue by four officers of the Boston Police's Youth Violence Strike Force who were patrolling the area in an unmarked police car.  One of the officers in the car, Gregory Brown, noticed that Cardoza and Ragsdale were acting indecisively about whether to continue walking up Humboldt, or instead cross the street in front of the police car.  Moving slowly, the police car approached Cardoza and Ragsdale from behind.  As the patrol car approached, Cardoza and Ragsdale crossed Humboldt Avenue in order to walk up the sidewalk of Ruthven Street, a one-way thoroughfare that emptied onto Humboldt Avenue.  As they crossed in front of the car, Officer Brown, who was sitting in the back seat on the driver's side, recognized Cardoza and directed the driver to make a left turn off Humboldt, and proceed the wrong way up Ruthven for a short distance.  Officer Brown testified that he wanted to ask Cardoza some questions concerning a shooting incident that had occurred some days earlier.  The driver took the left turn, and pulled over to the curb just off Humboldt, facing the wrong way on Ruthven Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Brown, whose window was rolled down, called out to Cardoza, asking \"What's up Freddie?   What are you doing out this time of night?\"   Cardoza stopped, turned, and approached the patrol car.  Ragsdale continued walking a short distance.  Officer Brown remained in the car conversing with Cardoza through the open car window.  As he talked with Officer Brown, Cardoza began to gesture with his hand, exposing the round of ammunition.  Seeing the round of ammunition, Brown exited the patrol car, and began to pat-frisk Cardoza.  At the same time, two other officers exited the car and approached and pat-frisked Ragsdale, discovering the handgun loaded with eight rounds of ammunition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza was indicted on four counts.  Count I charged Cardoza with being a felon-in-possession of one round of ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).  Count II charged Cardoza under the same statutory provision with being a felon-in-possession of the semi-automatic firearm, based on his alleged possession of the weapon for a short period of time after the transaction.  Count III charged Cardoza with causing the sale, delivery, and transfer of a handgun to a juvenile in violation of the Youth Handgun Safety Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(x).  Count IV charged Cardoza with aiding and abetting a juvenile in the possession of a handgun in violation of the same.  A jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts I, III, and IV, and acquitted on Count II.  Following the jury verdict, but prior to sentencing, the district court issued a memorandum detailing its refusal to grant both Cardoza's motion to dismiss and his motion for judgment of acquittal.

Cardoza suggests first that the statutory definition, by including the plural words \"cases, primers, [and] bullets\" bans only the possession of more than one piece of ammunition.  Second, he suggests that the word \"ammunition\" itself always means multiple rounds.  Finally, Cardoza argues that the definition of \"ammunition\" is sufficiently ambiguous to require application of the \"rule of lenity,\" United States v. Lanier, --- U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 1225, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997), in his favor.

Cardoza instead argues that &#167; 922(g) exceeds congressional commerce clause authority because it fails to require proof that possession of a single ammunition cartridge \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce as purportedly mandated by Lopez.   Cardoza would therefore have us hold that Lopez impliedly changes the meaning of the jurisdictional element present in &#167; 922(g) such that the ammunition which he possessed must have \"substantially affected\" interstate commerce before his conviction passes Commerce Clause scrutiny.  This application of the Lopez decision to &#167; 922(g) has been rejected by this court more than once.  United States v.

See United States v.

Therefore, because the Court had no occasion in Lopez to reach the question, 514 U.S. at 561-62, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31, it remains the law that where a federal criminal statute contains a jurisdictional element requiring proof that an object was \"in or affecting\" commerce, the government need only meet the \"minimal nexus\" test enunciated in Scarborough v.

Thus in Rybar, the Third Circuit upheld the constitutionality of a federal criminal statute making it illegal to \"transfer or possess a machinegun,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(o)(1) (West Supp.1997), stating that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>[t]here was no reason for Congress to believe that traffic in machine guns had any less connection with interstate commerce than did the possession of a firearm by a felon, and Congress' intent to regulate possession and transfer of machine guns as a means of stemming interstate gun trafficking is manifest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 282.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the third permitted category, \"[w]here economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.\"  Lopez, 514 U.S. at 560, 115 S.Ct. at 1630.   As an initial matter we find that the YHSA is a regulation of economic activity.  This is so because it prohibits expressly commercial activity, namely, the sale, transfer, or delivery of handguns to juveniles.  It therefore stands in direct opposition to the statute invalidated in Lopez, which \"by its terms ha[d] nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise....\"  Id. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we think the possessory prong of the YHSA, under which Cardoza was convicted of aiding and abetting, is \"an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\"  Id. This is so because the YHSA was designed expressly to \"stop[ ] the commerce in handguns with juveniles nationwide....\"  H.R. Conf.  Rep. No. 103-711, at 391 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1858, 1859.   Part of this regulatory approach involves the suppression of the demand for such handguns.  The YHSA can be thus seen as criminalization of the two points where the prohibited commerce finds its nexus;  the demand for the firearms (possession), and the sale or transfer designed to meet that demand.  The two prohibitions go hand in hand with one another.  Invalidation of one half of the equation would likely have deleterious effects on the efficacy of the legislation.  In this regard, we think it clear that given Congress' express purpose, its decision to punish both the supply (sale or transfer) and demand (possession) sides of the market is a means reasonably calculated to achieve its end.  Hodel, 452 U.S. at 276, 101 S.Ct. at 2360.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far, we have determined that the YHSA regulates economic activity, and that the possessory prong of the YHSA is integral to the regulation.  Assuming, then, for purposes of this appeal, that the regulated activity occurs solely intrastate, we must now pass on whether this activity \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce.  We turn first to the legislative findings on the matter.  Lopez, 514 U.S. at 562, 115 S.Ct. at 1631 (\"we of course consider legislative findings ... regarding effect on interstate commerce....\").  Concerned that \"[c]rime, particularly crime involving drugs and guns, is a pervasive, nationwide problem;  problems with crime at the local level are exacerbated by the interstate movement of drugs, guns and criminal gangs;  firearms and ammunition, and handguns in particular, move easily in interstate commerce,\" H.R. Conf.  Rep. No. 103-711, at 390 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1858, Congress found that \"it is necessary and appropriate to assist the States in controlling crime by stopping the commerce in handguns with juveniles nationwide....\"  Id. at 391, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1859.   This indicates that Congress determined that the market for handguns among juveniles was national.  We do not think this observation can be seriously disputed.  As the court in Rybar concluded, \"[c]ongressional findings generated throughout Congress' history of firearms regulation link both the flow of firearms across state lines and their consequential indiscriminate availability with the resulting violent criminal acts that are beyond the effective control of the state.\"  103 F.3d at 279.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer, therefore, to whether an intrastate market in handguns for juveniles \"substantially affects\" the interstate market in such commodities is obvious.  Simply put, the handgun must come from somewhere, often out of state.  Indeed, it is worth noting here that even though the YHSA does not require it, the government introduced evidence at trial that the handgun transferred to Ragsdale had, in fact, been manufactured outside Massachusetts.  Therefore, the supply and demand for handguns in any given state will \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce in handguns by causing the weapons to move across state lines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lopez, the Court examined its decision in Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942), stating that the decision was \"perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity....\"  Lopez, 514 U.S. at 560, 115 S.Ct. at 1630.   Still, Chief Justice Rehnquist quoted with approval the Wickard analysis that \"a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions.\"  Id. at 560, 115 S.Ct. at 1630 (quoting Wickard, 317 U.S. at 128, 63 S.Ct. at 90-91).   We think the intrastate commerce in handguns goes well beyond the \"substantial influence\" present in Wickard.   As such, the YHSA is proper under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Fourth Amendment Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza next challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress the bullet, arguing that the evidence was the result of an unconstitutional search and seizure.  Cardoza suggests that because the police admitted that they did not have reasonable and articulable suspicion to \"Terry-stop\" Cardoza, discovery of the bullet flowed from an unreasonable seizure, and thus must be excluded.  See generally United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975-77 (1st Cir.1994).  Because we agree that there was no \"seizure\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment at the time the police officer saw the bullet in Cardoza's hand, we uphold the lower court's denial of Cardoza's suppression motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a lower court's denial of a suppression motion is bifurcated.  We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error, United States v.

As we stated in Young, this deference to the lower court's fact finding \"reflects our awareness that the trial judge ... sits in the best position to determine what actually happened.\"  Id. Conversely, we review conclusions of law de novo, subjecting constitutional interpretations to plenary review.  Id.; Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).  Finally, as a general matter, we uphold a district court's denial of a suppression motion \"provided that any reasonable view of the evidence supports the decision.\"  McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 529.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the factual findings of the district court, which do not differ in substance from our recitation of the facts supra.   The record demonstrates that portions of the police officer's as well as Cardoza's and Ragsdale's testimony were credited in making the findings.  The court's findings of fact are supported by the evidence, United States v. Sealey, 30 F.3d 7, 8 (1st Cir.1994), and we detect no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the court's rulings of law, Cardoza argues that because the court stated at the hearing that in the absence of a response from Cardoza, \"the police officers would have run them down,\" the court was in essence finding that Cardoza was seized by the time the bullet was seen.  Although the lower court's legal conclusions on the Fourth Amendment issue lack the precision and clarity desirable for appellate review, we think Cardoza's argument ignores the entirety of the court's reasoning in favor of an irrelevant aside.  Reading the findings in total, it is apparent that the court determined that there was no \"stop\" within the meaning of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).  Our reasoning is as follows.  The court found that prior to seeing the bullet in his hand, the police had no basis upon which to constitutionally detain Mr. Cardoza.  Yet it went on to hold that the interaction between Officer Brown and Cardoza was \"lawful,\" and provided no grounds upon which to exclude the evidence.  Under current Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the only way the district court could have determined that the interaction was lawful (here meaning constitutional) and also hold that there was no reasonable and articulable suspicion upon which to detain Cardoza, was for it to decide that the police were not detaining, or seizing, Cardoza within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We conclude therefore that the court below determined that there was no seizure of Cardoza prior to Officer Brown's sighting of the bullet in Cardoza's hand.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 525 (\"Where specific findings are lacking, we view the record in the light most favorable to the ruling, making all reasonably supported inferences.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the gravamen of Cardoza's Fourth Amendment argument, namely, whether the district court's determination that there was no seizure was correct.  To be sure, \"not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves 'seizures' of persons.\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879 n. 16.  Instead, \"[i]nteraction between law enforcement officials and citizens generally falls within three tiers of Fourth Amendment analysis, depending on the level of police intrusion into a person's privacy.\"  Young, 105 F.3d at 5. The first tier \"encompasses interaction of such minimally intrusive nature that it does not trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment.\"  Id. It has therefore been recognized that police officers may approach citizens in public and ask questions without the need for articulable suspicion of criminal activity.  Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434-35, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 2386-87, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991);  Young, 105 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undoubtedly, Fourth Amendment analysis does not easily lend itself to bright line distinctions.

It is therefore the case that,in order to determine whether a particular encounter constitutes a seizure, a court must consider all the circumstances surrounding the encounter to determine whether the police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person that the person was not free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bostick, 501 U.S. at 439, 111 S.Ct. at 2389.   The test employed in this area is highly fact specific.  As a result, the Court in Bostick rejected a per se rule that police drug interdiction efforts on bus lines were always unconstitutional because it determined that any analysis that hinged on a single dispositive factor foreclosed consideration of \"all the circumstances....\"  Id.  See also Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 572, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 1979, 100 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988) (\"[A]ny assessment as to whether police conduct amounts to a seizure implicating the Fourth Amendment must take into account all of the circumstances surrounding the incident in each individual case.\")  (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decisions have adhered to an analysis that considers the totality of the circumstances particular to each encounter.  Young, 105 F.3d at 6. In doing so we have had the recent opportunity to examine the existence of Fourth Amendment seizures under facts remarkably similar to the case at hand.  Thus, in Young we found no seizure where a police cruiser \"pulled alongside [defendant], the officers identified themselves as Boston Police officers, and asked 'got a minute' to which [defendant] replied 'sure.' \"  Id. Similarly, in Sealey, there was no Fourth Amendment violation where police officers in a cruiser approached the defendant and yelled \"Hey Stephen, what's up?\" before the defendant took flight.  30 F.3d at 8, 10.   In each instance, our determination was informed by the observation that \"in the absence of an officer's exertion of physical force or an individual's submission to a show of authority, no seizure occurs.\"  Young, 105 F.3d at 6;  Sealey, 30 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza focuses our attention on several facts particular to his situation that ostensibly compel a holding contrary to Young and Sealey.   First, the question posed to him, \"Why are you out at this time of night?\" is more demanding and pointed an inquiry than the generalized queries at issue in Young and Sealey.   Second, the police cruiser turned the wrong way up a one-way street, albeit for a very short distance, making clear the officer's intention to come into contact with Cardoza.  Finally, Cardoza adds that his past interactions with the same officer led him to believe that he was not free to leave at the time he was called over.  Although each of these facts distinguishes his case from Young and Sealey, our job in identifying whether a Fourth Amendment seizure has occurred is not absolutely controlled by the traditional operation of factually similar precedent.  This is so because no two police-citizen encounters will ever be completely identical.  We therefore reject the government's assertion that Young dispositively controls the outcome of this appeal.  Instead, \"we adhere to our traditional contextual approach, and determine only that, in this particular case, the police conduct in question did not amount to a seizure.\"  Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 573, 108 S.Ct. at 1979.   We make this determination in the instant case because the police conduct at issue was not a \"show of authority\" within the meaning of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 625-29, 111 S.Ct. at 1550-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Court observed in Hodari D., \"the test for existence of a 'show of authority' is an objective one:  not whether the citizen perceived that he was being ordered to restrict his movement, but whether the officer's words and actions would have conveyed that to a reasonable person.\"  Id. at 628, 111 S.Ct. at 1551.   Similarly, it was noted in Chesternut that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>[t]he test is necessarily imprecise, because it is designed to assess the coercive effect of police conduct, taken as a whole, rather than to focus on particular details of that conduct in isolation.  Moreover, what constitutes a restraint on liberty prompting a person to conclude that he is not free to \"leave\" will vary, not only with the particular police conduct at issue, but also with the setting in which the conduct occurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">486 U.S. at 573, 108 S.Ct. at 1979.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry is not directed at whether the police conduct objectively communicated police desire to speak to Cardoza, or ask him a question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Rather, we must determine whether their conduct indicated that they were interfering with his liberty to such an extent that he was not free to leave.  We think the distinction important, and are left, therefore, with the conclusion that the police officers' conduct on the night in question would not have communicated to a reasonable person that the police were attempting to \"intrude upon [Cardoza's] freedom of movement.\"  Id. at 575, 108 S.Ct. at 1980.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, no sirens or flashing lights were used by the officers to indicate to Cardoza that he should stop in his tracks.  Similarly, the police cruiser pulled over and stopped at the curb before Officer Brown called out to Cardoza.  Compare Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 576, 108 S.Ct. at 1980-81 (short drive alongside defendant not \"so intimidating\" as to constitute seizure).  And Officer Brown remained in the car when he called out to Cardoza.  In total, the encounter does not objectively communicate a \"restrain[t against] his freedom to walk away....\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1877.   Officer Brown did not ask Cardoza to stop, or even to approach the car.  He simply called out through an open car window with the question \"what are you doing out at this time of night?\"   Those words do not objectively communicate an attempt to restrain Cardoza's liberty.  We are therefore unpersuaded that the police officers' actions transformed \"mere police questioning,\" Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434, 111 S.Ct. at 2386, into a seizure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, of course, the import of Cardoza's observation that few people, including himself, would ever feel free to walk away from any police question.  Under this reasoning, however, the standard reiterated in Bostick transforms every police-citizen encounter into a seizure.  See United States v. Tavolacci, 895 F.2d 1423, 1425 (D.C.Cir.1990)(recognizing criticism of test as \"based on a false assumption that ordinary citizens believe they are normally free to cut police inquiries short.\").  The \"free to walk away\" test, however, must be read in conjunction with the Court's frequent admonitions that \"a seizure does not occur simply because a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few questions.\"  Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434, 111 S.Ct. at 2386;  Terry, 392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879 n. 16.  What emerges between the two imperatives, therefore, is the directive that police conduct, viewed from the totality of the circumstances, must objectively communicate that the officer is exercising his or her official authority to restrain the individual's liberty of movement before we can find that a seizure occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Because there was no such objective communication in the instant case, we affirm the district court's denial of Cardoza's motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>The Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza's final argument posits that his 235-month sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") and the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\") offends both the Eighth Amendment's proscriptions against cruel and unusual punishments and the Fifth Amendment's guarantees of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza was sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal enhancement, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e), and the corresponding Guideline section, U.S.S.G &#167; 4B1.4, because he violated the felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), and had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies which had been committed on occasions different from one another.  Cardoza's Pre-Sentence Report (\"PSR\") contains a record of four violent felonies of which he had been convicted, which are described below, the facts being drawn from the unobjected-to portions of the PSR. United States v. Voccola, 99 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 27, 1988, Cardoza was arrested and arraigned for attempting to steal an automobile, assault and battery of a police officer, receipt of stolen property, and possession of burglarious tools.  On February 13, 1989, he was arrested and arraigned for stealing a woman's wallet at a local mall, possession of burglarious tools, and receipt of a stolen car which he had attempted to use in his getaway.  On March 15, 1989, Cardoza and another individual were arrested for armed robbery, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, having held up an individual by restraining the victim from behind and holding a screwdriver against the victim's throat.  He was convicted of this latter offense and sentenced on July 28, 1989, in Suffolk County Superior Court to twenty years for the armed robbery count, two years to serve, and ten years on the assault and battery with a dangerous weapon count, one year to serve.  He was convicted and sentenced on August 18, 1989, for the former two offenses in Roxbury District Court to two and one-half years incarceration for each, sentences to run concurrent with the sentence imposed in Suffolk Superior Court for the armed robbery charge.  Cardoza was released from prison on June 10, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than four months after his release, on October 2, 1991, he was arrested with four other men after the car in which they were riding pulled up beside another vehicle, a passenger in the car containing Cardoza pointed a semi-automatic weapon out the window, and proceeded to fire four rounds into the adjacent automobile.  He was convicted and sentenced in Suffolk County Superior Court for assault with a dangerous weapon, knowingly receiving stolen property, and possession of a firearm.  He received three to five years incarceration.  Cardoza was released on September 30, 1994.  The offenses for which he was convicted in the instant appeal occurred just over nine months later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the government and Cardoza's counsel agreed that the proper sentence calculation under the ACCA and U.S.S.G. was 235 to 293 months.  No argument was made by Cardoza's counsel to depart downward.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Cardoza did, however, press his constitutional arguments both in his objections to the PSR and at the disposition hearing.  Cardoza was sentenced to 235 months incarceration on Count I, one year each on Counts III and IV to run concurrent with Count I and each other, and supervised release of five years.  The court concluded sentencing with the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>I've given you the most lenient sentence that I am authorized to give under the law.  And yet that lenient sentence, at least given what discretion I have, sentences you to prison for nearly 20 years of your life.  And the fact is that, ... as you were building up this conviction after conviction after conviction after conviction in the state courts, with these short sentences or no sentences, you were laying the groundwork for this sentence which is imposed upon you exactly as [your attorney] explained it, because you are a felon in possession of ammunition, one bullet;  and because, given your prior history, you are considered by the Court and by society to be an armed career criminal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, these are the laws that I must follow.  Society has decided through the Congress that it simply will not tolerate this violence, will not tolerate people who have such a record from committing other crimes.  I am required to impose this sentence given the legal framework under which we operate.  It is a just sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>The Eighth Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza supports his Eighth Amendment challenge on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision in Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983), arguing that his sentence, like the life sentence imposed in Helm under a recidivist statute for writing a $100 \"no-account\" check, is \"significantly disproportionate to his crime, and is therefore prohibited by the Eighth Amendment,\" id. at 303, 103 S.Ct. at 3016-17.   He acknowledges that we have rejected a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the ACCA, United States v. Gilliard, 847 F.2d 21, 27 (1st Cir.1988), and instead questions only the constitutionality of the ACCA provisions as applied to him, given that his possessory offense involved only one bullet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Court in Helm stated that \"[t]he constitutional principle of proportionality has been recognized explicitly in the Court for almost a century,\" Helm, 463 U.S. at 286, 103 S.Ct. at 3007-08, it also recognized that \"prior convictions are relevant to the sentencing decision\", id. at 296 n. 21, 103 S.Ct. at 3013 n. 21.  Similarly, the Court's most recent examination of proportionality has, at the very least, cast doubt on the exact method by which a reviewing court should approach such challenges in non-capital cases.  In the plurality opinion of Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991), two justices sought to limit proportionality review to capital cases only, id. at 994, 111 S.Ct. at 2701 (opinion of Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J.), three justices recognized a \"narrow proportionality principle,\" id. at 997, 111 S.Ct. at 2702 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by O'Connor and Souter, JJ.), and three justices dissented on the grounds that Helm 's three-factor proportionality review controlled, id. at 1021, 111 S.Ct. at 2715-16 (White, J., dissenting, joined by Blackmun and Stevens, JJ.).  We have interpreted Harmelin to require a defendant seeking proportionality review to demonstrate, at the threshold, an \"initial inference of gross disproportionality,\" Tart v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 949 F.2d 490, 503 n. 16 (1st Cir.1991), between the \"gravity of [the] criminal conduct and the severity of the ... penalty\" imposed, United States v. Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d 937, 946 (1st Cir.1992).  See Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1005, 111 S.Ct. at 2707 (opinion of Kennedy, J.)  (\"[I]ntrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional analyses are appropriate only in the rare case in which a threshold comparison of the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportionality.\");  United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 788-89 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1322, 134 L.Ed.2d 474 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in Graciani, we upheld a 280-month sentence for the distribution of 85.3 grams of crack cocaine against a proportionality attack.  61 F.3d at 73, 77.   Similarly, in Saccoccia we upheld a mandatory life sentence in a drug-money laundering scheme, stating that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>Congress--not the judiciary--is vested with the authority to define, and attempt to solve, the societal problems created by drug trafficking across national and state borders.  The Supreme Court has made it plain that the use of severe penalties as part of the legislative armamentarium does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">58 F.3d at 789.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we cannot say that Cardoza's sentence supports the necessary \"inference of gross disproportionality.\"  Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d at 946.   Cardoza has not been sentenced to a 235-month incarceration solely because he was in possession of a single bullet, as his brief strenuously argues.  Rather, he has been sentenced to such a term because (1) he was a convicted felon in possession of the bullet, and (2) he had previously been convicted of at least three violent felonies.  Further, despite counsel for appellant's position at oral argument, a bullet is not a \"souvenir.\"   It is a live round of ammunition capable of doing considerable harm when fired from a gun.  With those clarifications in mind, the sentence imposed upon him under the ACCA recidivist statute does not give rise to an inference of constitutional infirmity.  As we stated in Gilliard,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of a recidivist statute ... is not to simplify the task of prosecutors, judges or juries.  Its primary goals are to deter repeat offenders and, at some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the rest of society for an extended period of time....  Like the line dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">847 F.2d at 26 (quoting Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1144-45, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980)).  While it may be the case that reasonable persons will disagree as to the wisdom of the policy choice inherent in the imposition of a sentence such as this, such disagreements do not, in the instant case, give rise to constitutional concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the years preceding his conviction below, Cardoza had racked up at least three convictions for violent felonies in the state courts.  Responding to the very problem presented by Cardoza's conduct, Congress decided to \"infuse federal law enforcement into efforts at curbing and 'incapacitating\"'armed, habitual (career) criminals.' \"  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 1073, at 2 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3661, 3662).   Viewing, therefore, the total conduct for which Cardoza has been sentenced, we cannot find a supportable inference of gross disproportionality, and thus reject his Eighth Amendment challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Due Process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note at the outset that Cardoza's due process challenge was not raised below.  The only mention made of this challenge in the district court is by incantation of the term \"Due Process\" in Cardoza's objections to the PSR. It is well-settled that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived....  It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work....\"  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).  We therefore review Cardoza's claim for plain error.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-77, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  It does not occupy our attention for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza bases his due process challenge on our decision in United States v. Lombard, 72 F.3d 170 (1st Cir.1995)  (Lombard I).   There, we vacated a sentence and remanded because the district court erroneously believed that it had no authority to depart downward, despite the substantial effect that consideration of previously acquitted conduct had on Lombard's sentence.  Id. at 187.   We were concerned that \"the sentencing phase of the defendant's trial produced the conclusion he had committed murder and mandated imposition of a life sentence, but without the protections which normally attend the criminal process, such as the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Id. at 179-80.   Our decision was compelled by both the extreme facts and the determination that the \"district court did not recognize its authority to consider whether a downward departure would have been appropriate....\"  Id. at 187.   We were, however, clear that Lombard I is \"an unusual and perhaps a singular case, at the boundaries of constitutional sentencing law, and does not provide an open door.\"  Id. Indeed, following remand, we upheld the imposition of the same life sentence, after the district court recognized its authority to depart, and chose not to exercise it.  United States v. Lombard, 102 F.3d 1, 2, 5 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2437, 138 L.Ed.2d 197 (1997)(Lombard II).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the concerns animating our decision in Lombard I are present here.  Most importantly, the enhancement below was predicated on convictions that were obtained in state court, as opposed to the uncharged, indeed acquitted, conduct enhancements at play in Lombard I.  And Cardoza does not suggest that he was denied any of the procedural protections found lacking in Lombard I.  In short, we do not think this case lies, like Lombard I, \"at the boundaries of constitutional sentencing law....\"  Lombard I, 72 F.3d at 187.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Cardoza makes three brief arguments concerning the calculation of his criminal history.  As Cardoza himself recognizes, however, resolution of any errors would not affect his sentence.  We therefore need not reach them.  We note only that should Cardoza return to the district court for resentencing, see supra note 8, this opinion does not preclude him from raising, at that time, his criminal history arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions and sentence below are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note that even the Supreme Court has assumed, albeit in dicta, that the term \"ammunition\" means a single bullet.

In July of 1995, a sixteen-year-old acquaintance of Cardoza, Myron Ragsdale, asked Cardoza to secure a handgun for him to purchase.  Cardoza found a dealer willing to sell a nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun to Ragsdale for $200.00.  On the night of July 14, 1995, Cardoza and Ragsdale went to Walnut Park in Roxbury, Massachusetts, to make the gun purchase.  Ragsdale paid $200.00 for the handgun and nine rounds of ammunition.  Ragsdale loaded the gun with eight rounds of ammunition, and Cardoza took possession of the ninth round.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime after the transaction was completed, Cardoza and Ragsdale began walking along Humboldt Avenue.  As they walked, Ragsdale had the handgun in his waistband and Cardoza carried the single round of ammunition in his hand.  By this time it was approximately 2:00 a.m.  on the morning of July 15.  They were spotted walking along Humboldt Avenue by four officers of the Boston Police's Youth Violence Strike Force who were patrolling the area in an unmarked police car.  One of the officers in the car, Gregory Brown, noticed that Cardoza and Ragsdale were acting indecisively about whether to continue walking up Humboldt, or instead cross the street in front of the police car.  Moving slowly, the police car approached Cardoza and Ragsdale from behind.  As the patrol car approached, Cardoza and Ragsdale crossed Humboldt Avenue in order to walk up the sidewalk of Ruthven Street, a one-way thoroughfare that emptied onto Humboldt Avenue.  As they crossed in front of the car, Officer Brown, who was sitting in the back seat on the driver's side, recognized Cardoza and directed the driver to make a left turn off Humboldt, and proceed the wrong way up Ruthven for a short distance.  Officer Brown testified that he wanted to ask Cardoza some questions concerning a shooting incident that had occurred some days earlier.  The driver took the left turn, and pulled over to the curb just off Humboldt, facing the wrong way on Ruthven Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Brown, whose window was rolled down, called out to Cardoza, asking \"What's up Freddie?

Officer Brown remained in the car conversing with Cardoza through the open car window.  As he talked with Officer Brown, Cardoza began to gesture with his hand, exposing the round of ammunition.  Seeing the round of ammunition, Brown exited the patrol car, and began to pat-frisk Cardoza.  At the same time, two other officers exited the car and approached and pat-frisked Ragsdale, discovering the handgun loaded with eight rounds of ammunition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza was indicted on four counts.  Count I charged Cardoza with being a felon-in-possession of one round of ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).  Count II charged Cardoza under the same statutory provision with being a felon-in-possession of the semi-automatic firearm, based on his alleged possession of the weapon for a short period of time after the transaction.  Count III charged Cardoza with causing the sale, delivery, and transfer of a handgun to a juvenile in violation of the Youth Handgun Safety Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(x).  Count IV charged Cardoza with aiding and abetting a juvenile in the possession of a handgun in violation of the same.  A jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts I, III, and IV, and acquitted on Count II.  Following the jury verdict, but prior to sentencing, the district court issued a memorandum detailing its refusal to grant both Cardoza's motion to dismiss and his motion for judgment of acquittal.

Cardoza suggests first that the statutory definition, by including the plural words \"cases, primers, [and] bullets\" bans only the possession of more than one piece of ammunition.  Second, he suggests that the word \"ammunition\" itself always means multiple rounds.

As an initial matter we find that the YHSA is a regulation of economic activity.  This is so because it prohibits expressly commercial activity, namely, the sale, transfer, or delivery of handguns to juveniles.  It therefore stands in direct opposition to the statute invalidated in Lopez, which \"by its terms ha[d] nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise....\"  Id. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we think the possessory prong of the YHSA, under which Cardoza was convicted of aiding and abetting, is \"an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\"  Id. This is so because the YHSA was designed expressly to \"stop[ ] the commerce in handguns with juveniles nationwide....\"  H.R. Conf.  Rep. No. 103-711, at 391 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1858, 1859.   Part of this regulatory approach involves the suppression of the demand for such handguns.  The YHSA can be thus seen as criminalization of the two points where the prohibited commerce finds its nexus;  the demand for the firearms (possession), and the sale or transfer designed to meet that demand.  The two prohibitions go hand in hand with one another.  Invalidation of one half of the equation would likely have deleterious effects on the efficacy of the legislation.  In this regard, we think it clear that given Congress' express purpose, its decision to punish both the supply (sale or transfer) and demand (possession) sides of the market is a means reasonably calculated to achieve its end.  Hodel, 452 U.S. at 276, 101 S.Ct. at 2360.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far, we have determined that the YHSA regulates economic activity, and that the possessory prong of the YHSA is integral to the regulation.  Assuming, then, for purposes of this appeal, that the regulated activity occurs solely intrastate, we must now pass on whether this activity \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce.  We turn first to the legislative findings on the matter.  Lopez, 514 U.S. at 562, 115 S.Ct. at 1631 (\"we of course consider legislative findings ... regarding effect on interstate commerce....\").  Concerned that \"[c]rime, particularly crime involving drugs and guns, is a pervasive, nationwide problem;  problems with crime at the local level are exacerbated by the interstate movement of drugs, guns and criminal gangs;  firearms and ammunition, and handguns in particular, move easily in interstate commerce,\" H.R. Conf.  Rep. No. 103-711, at 390 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1858, Congress found that \"it is necessary and appropriate to assist the States in controlling crime by stopping the commerce in handguns with juveniles nationwide....\"  Id. at 391, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1859.   This indicates that Congress determined that the market for handguns among juveniles was national.  We do not think this observation can be seriously disputed.  As the court in Rybar concluded, \"[c]ongressional findings generated throughout Congress' history of firearms regulation link both the flow of firearms across state lines and their consequential indiscriminate availability with the resulting violent criminal acts that are beyond the effective control of the state.\"  103 F.3d at 279.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer, therefore, to whether an intrastate market in handguns for juveniles \"substantially affects\" the interstate market in such commodities is obvious.  Simply put, the handgun must come from somewhere, often out of state.  Indeed, it is worth noting here that even though the YHSA does not require it, the government introduced evidence at trial that the handgun transferred to Ragsdale had, in fact, been manufactured outside Massachusetts.  Therefore, the supply and demand for handguns in any given state will \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce in handguns by causing the weapons to move across state lines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lopez, the Court examined its decision in Wickard v.

Still, Chief Justice Rehnquist quoted with approval the Wickard analysis that \"a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions.\"  Id. at 560, 115 S.Ct. at 1630 (quoting Wickard, 317 U.S. at 128, 63 S.Ct. at 90-91).   We think the intrastate commerce in handguns goes well beyond the \"substantial influence\" present in Wickard.   As such, the YHSA is proper under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>The Fourth Amendment Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza next challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress the bullet, arguing that the evidence was the result of an unconstitutional search and seizure.

The record demonstrates that portions of the police officer's as well as Cardoza's and Ragsdale's testimony were credited in making the findings.  The court's findings of fact are supported by the evidence, United States v. Sealey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195505\"><a href=\"/opinion/195505/united-states-v-sealey/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1994), and we detect no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the court's rulings of law, Cardoza argues that because the court stated at the hearing that in the absence of a response from Cardoza, \"the police officers would have run them down,\" the court was in essence finding that Cardoza was seized by the time the bullet was seen.  Although the lower court's legal conclusions on the Fourth Amendment issue lack the precision and clarity desirable for appellate review, we think Cardoza's argument ignores the entirety of the court's reasoning in favor of an irrelevant aside.  Reading the findings in total, it is apparent that the court determined that there was no \"stop\" within the meaning of Terry v. Ohio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span> (1968).  Our reasoning is as follows.  The court found that prior to seeing the bullet in his hand, the police had no basis upon which to constitutionally detain Mr. Cardoza.  Yet it went on to hold that the interaction between Officer Brown and Cardoza was \"lawful,\" and provided no grounds upon which to exclude the evidence.  Under current Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the only way the district court could have determined that the interaction was lawful (here meaning constitutional) and also hold that there was no reasonable and articulable suspicion upon which to detain Cardoza, was for it to decide that the police were not detaining, or seizing, Cardoza within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We conclude therefore that the court below determined that there was no seizure of Cardoza prior to Officer Brown's sighting of the bullet in Cardoza's hand.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 525 (\"Where specific findings are lacking, we view the record in the light most favorable to the ruling, making all reasonably supported inferences.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the gravamen of Cardoza's Fourth Amendment argument, namely, whether the district court's determination that there was no seizure was correct.  To be sure, \"not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves 'seizures' of persons.\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879 n. 16.  Instead, \"[i]nteraction between law enforcement officials and citizens generally falls within three tiers of Fourth Amendment analysis, depending on the level of police intrusion into a person's privacy.\"  Young, 105 F.3d at 5. The first tier \"encompasses interaction of such minimally intrusive nature that it does not trigger the protections of the Fourth Amendment.\"  Id. It has therefore been recognized that police officers may approach citizens in public and ask questions without the need for articulable suspicion of criminal activity.  Florida v.

See Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975.   It is therefore the case that,in order to determine whether a particular encounter constitutes a seizure, a court must consider all the circumstances surrounding the encounter to determine whether the police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person that the person was not free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bostick, 501 U.S. at 439, 111 S.Ct. at 2389.

First, the question posed to him, \"Why are you out at this time of night?\" is more demanding and pointed an inquiry than the generalized queries at issue in Young and Sealey.   Second, the police cruiser turned the wrong way up a one-way street, albeit for a very short distance, making clear the officer's intention to come into contact with Cardoza.  Finally, Cardoza adds that his past interactions with the same officer led him to believe that he was not free to leave at the time he was called over.  Although each of these facts distinguishes his case from Young and Sealey, our job in identifying whether a Fourth Amendment seizure has occurred is not absolutely controlled by the traditional operation of factually similar precedent.  This is so because no two police-citizen encounters will ever be completely identical.  We therefore reject the government's assertion that Young dispositively controls the outcome of this appeal.  Instead, \"we adhere to our traditional contextual approach, and determine only that, in this particular case, the police conduct in question did not amount to a seizure.\"  Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 573, 108 S.Ct. at 1979.   We make this determination in the instant case because the police conduct at issue was not a \"show of authority\" within the meaning of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 625-29, 111 S.Ct. at 1550-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Court observed in Hodari D., \"the test for existence of a 'show of authority' is an objective one:  not whether the citizen perceived that he was being ordered to restrict his movement, but whether the officer's words and actions would have conveyed that to a reasonable person.\"  Id. at 628, 111 S.Ct. at 1551.   Similarly, it was noted in Chesternut that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>[t]he test is necessarily imprecise, because it is designed to assess the coercive effect of police conduct, taken as a whole, rather than to focus on particular details of that conduct in isolation.  Moreover, what constitutes a restraint on liberty prompting a person to conclude that he is not free to \"leave\" will vary, not only with the particular police conduct at issue, but also with the setting in which the conduct occurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">486 U.S. at 573, 108 S.Ct. at 1979.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry is not directed at whether the police conduct objectively communicated police desire to speak to Cardoza, or ask him a question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Rather, we must determine whether their conduct indicated that they were interfering with his liberty to such an extent that he was not free to leave.  We think the distinction important, and are left, therefore, with the conclusion that the police officers' conduct on the night in question would not have communicated to a reasonable person that the police were attempting to \"intrude upon [Cardoza's] freedom of movement.\"  Id. at 575, 108 S.Ct. at 1980.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, no sirens or flashing lights were used by the officers to indicate to Cardoza that he should stop in his tracks.  Similarly, the police cruiser pulled over and stopped at the curb before Officer Brown called out to Cardoza.  Compare Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 576, 108 S.Ct. at 1980-81 (short drive alongside defendant not \"so intimidating\" as to constitute seizure).  And Officer Brown remained in the car when he called out to Cardoza.  In total, the encounter does not objectively communicate a \"restrain[t against] his freedom to walk away....\"  Terry, 392 U.S. at 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1877.   Officer Brown did not ask Cardoza to stop, or even to approach the car.  He simply called out through an open car window with the question \"what are you doing out at this time of night?\"   Those words do not objectively communicate an attempt to restrain Cardoza's liberty.  We are therefore unpersuaded that the police officers' actions transformed \"mere police questioning,\" Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434, 111 S.Ct. at 2386, into a seizure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, of course, the import of Cardoza's observation that few people, including himself, would ever feel free to walk away from any police question.  Under this reasoning, however, the standard reiterated in Bostick transforms every police-citizen encounter into a seizure.  See United States v. Tavolacci, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536493\"><a href=\"/opinion/536493/united-states-v-leo-j-tavolacci/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1423</span></a></span>, 1425 (D.C.Cir.1990)(recognizing criticism of test as \"based on a false assumption that ordinary citizens believe they are normally free to cut police inquiries short.\").  The \"free to walk away\" test, however, must be read in conjunction with the Court's frequent admonitions that \"a seizure does not occur simply because a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few questions.\"  Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434, 111 S.Ct. at 2386;  Terry, 392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879 n. 16.  What emerges between the two imperatives, therefore, is the directive that police conduct, viewed from the totality of the circumstances, must objectively communicate that the officer is exercising his or her official authority to restrain the individual's liberty of movement before we can find that a seizure occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Because there was no such objective communication in the instant case, we affirm the district court's denial of Cardoza's motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>The Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza's final argument posits that his 235-month sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") and the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\") offends both the Eighth Amendment's proscriptions against cruel and unusual punishments and the Fifth Amendment's guarantees of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardoza was sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal enhancement, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e), and the corresponding Guideline section, U.S.S.G &#167; 4B1.4, because he violated the felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), and had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies which had been committed on occasions different from one another.

On February 13, 1989, he was arrested and arraigned for stealing a woman's wallet at a local mall, possession of burglarious tools, and receipt of a stolen car which he had attempted to use in his getaway.  On March 15, 1989, Cardoza and another individual were arrested for armed robbery, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, having held up an individual by restraining the victim from behind and holding a screwdriver against the victim's throat.  He was convicted of this latter offense and sentenced on July 28, 1989, in Suffolk County Superior Court to twenty years for the armed robbery count, two years to serve, and ten years on the assault and battery with a dangerous weapon count, one year to serve.  He was convicted and sentenced on August 18, 1989, for the former two offenses in Roxbury District Court to two and one-half years incarceration for each, sentences to run concurrent with the sentence imposed in Suffolk Superior Court for the armed robbery charge.

He was convicted and sentenced in Suffolk County Superior Court for assault with a dangerous weapon, knowingly receiving stolen property, and possession of a firearm.  He received three to five years incarceration.  Cardoza was released on September 30, 1994.

No argument was made by Cardoza's counsel to depart downward.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Cardoza did, however, press his constitutional arguments both in his objections to the PSR and at the disposition hearing.  Cardoza was sentenced to 235 months incarceration on Count I, one year each on Counts III and IV to run concurrent with Count I and each other, and supervised release of five years.  The court concluded sentencing with the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>I've given you the most lenient sentence that I am authorized to give under the law.

Cardoza has not been sentenced to a 235-month incarceration solely because he was in possession of a single bullet, as his brief strenuously argues.  Rather, he has been sentenced to such a term because (1) he was a convicted felon in possession of the bullet, and (2) he had previously been convicted of at least three violent felonies.  Further, despite counsel for appellant's position at oral argument, a bullet is not a \"souvenir.\"   It is a live round of ammunition capable of doing considerable harm when fired from a gun.

Most importantly, the enhancement below was predicated on convictions that were obtained in state court, as opposed to the uncharged, indeed acquitted, conduct enhancements at play in Lombard I.  And Cardoza does not suggest that he was denied any of the procedural protections found lacking in Lombard I.  In short, we do not think this case lies, like Lombard I, \"at the boundaries of constitutional sentencing law....\"  Lombard I, 72 F.3d at 187.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Cardoza makes three brief arguments concerning the calculation of his criminal history.  As Cardoza himself recognizes, however, resolution of any errors would not affect his sentence.  We therefore need not reach them.  We note only that should Cardoza return to the district court for resentencing, see supra note 8, this opinion does not preclude him from raising, at that time, his criminal history arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions and sentence below are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note that even the Supreme Court has assumed, albeit in dicta, that the term \"ammunition\" means a single bullet.  See United States v. Batchelder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110091\"><a href=\"/opinion/110091/united-states-v-batchelder/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, 121 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110091\"><a href=\"/opinion/110091/united-states-v-batchelder/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hodari D., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, 626, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112579\"><a href=\"/opinion/112579/california-v-hodari-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span> (1991), because of the fact that Cardoza's actions were motivated not by acquiescence to a police request, but rather his own strategic decision.  We note only that, given the generally objective standards employed in Fourth Amendment seizure analysis, we would see little reason to inquire into the subjective intent of the detainee in making the determination whether or not he or she has \"submitted to\" a show of authority</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Indeed, it would appear that this is exactly what the district court was referring to when it stated at the suppression hearing that the police \"intended to exercise their authority at least to bring themselves into a position to confront Mr. Cardoza.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> As for Cardoza's contention that the court's observation that the police officers would have \"run them down\" compels a contrary holding, he is mistaken.  In determining whether a seizure occurred, \"the subjective intent of the officers is relevant to an assessment of the Fourth Amendment implications of police conduct only to the extent that that intent has been conveyed to the person confronted.\"  Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 575 n. 7, 108 S.Ct. at 1980 n. 7</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We briefly elaborate on the facts underlying Cardoza's four violent felonies not because the facts of each conviction are relevant to the sentencing process itself.  They are not.  See United States v. Damon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197584\"><a href=\"/opinion/197584/united-states-v-damon/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 145 (1st Cir.1997)(\"Congress intended that the Guidelines take a categorical approach to sentencing.\").  Instead, we provide a short explication in order to refute Cardoza's contention that he is being sentenced solely for possession of a bullet</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Cardoza notes in his brief his contention that several of his convictions below were unconstitutionally obtained.  His counsel conceded at the disposition hearing, however, that he cannot collaterally attack these convictions at sentencing.  Custis v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, 497, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span> (1994).  The district court was correct that Cardoza may return to it should a subsequent constitutional attack prove successful.  United States v. Pettiford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197099\"><a href=\"/opinion/197099/united-states-v-pettiford/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Cardoza also makes vague allusions in his brief to double jeopardy and federalism concerns attendant in his sentence.  These arguments are completely undeveloped, and are deemed waived.  See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
