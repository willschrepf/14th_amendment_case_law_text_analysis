After review, we affirm.\n\n                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Facts1\n\n       In the fall of 2010, J.A.M. enrolled at Nova’s College of Osteopathic\n\nMedicine and successfully completed his first semester. In April 2011, J.A.M.\n\nexperienced a recurrence of his major depressive disorder. During that episode,\n\nJ.A.M. heavily consumed alcohol for a week and eventually checked into a\n\nhospital for inpatient psychiatric stabilization. Nova granted J.A.M. retroactive\n\nmedical leave and, following the episode, J.A.M. returned to school and\n\nsuccessfully resumed his studies.\n\n       Nova’s Associate Dean for Student Affairs referred J.A.M. to a student\n\nassistance program, which required him to sign a “one-size-fits-all agreement\n\ncalling for random drug tests and abstinence from alcohol.” In the fall of 2011,\n\nJ.A.M. experienced a recurrence of his major depressive disorder, which caused\n\n       1\n        We recount the facts from the allegations in the amended complaint, which we accept as\ntrue and construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Cinotto v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 674\nF.3d 1285, 1291 (11th Cir. 2012).\n\n\n                                                     2\n\f             Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016   Page: 3 of 13\n\n\nhim to fail many classes and binge drink. During this second episode, J.A.M. spent\n\nsix days in a psychiatric hospital. Following his release from the hospital, Nova\n\ninformed J.A.M. that he would have to take a leave of absence and obtain the\n\napproval of the Student Progress Committee to resume his studies. J.A.M. took a\n\nseven-month leave of absence, reenrolled in the fall of 2012, and passed all classes\n\nhe had previously failed.\n\n      In November 2012, J.A.M. suffered a third depressive episode that involved\n\ndrinking and was twice hospitalized for inpatient psychiatric stabilization. During\n\nthe December 2012 winter break, J.A.M. checked himself into a dual-diagnoses\n\ntreatment program. In January 2013, he resumed his classes. In April 2013,\n\nJ.A.M. suffered a fourth depressive episode and was hospitalized for “alcohol-\n\ninvolved psychiatric stabilization.” In sum, from 2011 to 2014, J.A.M. was unable\n\nto complete a single full semester of medical school without suffering a relapse of\n\nhis major depressive disorder during the semester.\n\n      Nova discovered that J.A.M.’s fourth depressive episode involved alcohol\n\nand told him that he would need to take another medical leave of absence. Nova\n\nalso told him that the Student Progress Committee would have to approve his\n\nreadmission. During his third medical leave of absence, J.A.M. underwent a\n\npartial-hospitalization program for 45 days and then moved into a transitional\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f              Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016    Page: 4 of 13\n\n\nliving facility for two months of intensive outpatient therapy and another month of\n\nnormal outpatient therapy.\n\n      At the end of 2013, Nova’s Chair of the Department of Psychiatry examined\n\nJ.A.M. and cleared him to return to school, with monitoring. Notwithstanding this\n\nclearance, Nova required J.A.M. to appear before the Student Progress Committee,\n\nwhose members questioned him about whether he had breached his substance\n\nabuse and alcohol agreement. In response to the committee’s inquiries, J.A.M.\n\nexplained that he had never been to class intoxicated, had never seen a patient\n\nwhile intoxicated, and had never been in any sort of conflict with faculty, staff, or\n\nother students. The committee voted to dismiss J.A.M. from Nova because all four\n\nof his depressive episodes “involved alcohol.” The committee’s recommendation\n\nwas accepted by the dean and affirmed by Nova’s internal appeals process.\n\nB.    Procedural History\n\n      On April 10, 2015, J.A.M. filed a counseled, two-count amended complaint\n\n(the “complaint”) in federal district court against Nova, alleging (1) disability\n\ndiscrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 794(a) (Count I), and (2) disability discrimination under Title III of the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) (Count II).\n\nJ.A.M. alleged that Nova excluded him from participation in the College of\n\nOsteopathic Medicine due to his mental illness and, therefore, “discriminated\n\n\n                                              4\n\f              Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016   Page: 5 of 13\n\n\nagainst him solely by reason of his disability,” in violation of the RA. J.A.M.\n\nfurther alleged that Nova “dismissed him . . . in reliance on his being mentally\n\ndisabled,” in violation of the ADA.\n\n      On April 16, 2015, Nova filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure\n\nto state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In an\n\nAugust 12, 2015 order, the district court granted Nova’s motion and dismissed the\n\ncomplaint. J.A.M. appealed.\n\n                                 II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review de novo the district court’s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to state a claim. Cinotto v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 674 F.3d 1285,\n\n1291 (11th Cir. 2012). When evaluating a motion to dismiss, a court looks to see\n\nwhether the complaint contains sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a\n\nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face. Surtain v. Hamlin Terrace Found., 789\n\nF.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir. 2015). This plausibility standard is met when the\n\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable\n\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. Id. “A pleading\n\nthat offers a formulaic recitation of elements of a cause of action will not do.”\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted). “[C]onclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of fact or legal\n\n\n                                              5\n\f              Case: 15-13883      Date Filed: 04/06/2016     Page: 6 of 13\n\n\nconclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal.” Oxford Asset\n\nMgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002).\n\nB.     ADA Title III Claim\n\n       Title III of the ADA sets forth a general rule against disability-based\n\ndiscrimination in public accommodations 2:\n\n       No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability\n       in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities,\n       privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public\n       accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or\n       operates a place of public accommodation.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) (emphasis added). Title III also sets forth a statutory\n\ndefinition of “discrimination,” which includes, inter alia:\n\n       (i) the imposition or application of eligibility criteria that screen out\n       or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any class of\n       individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any\n       goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations,\n       unless such criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of\n       the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\n       accommodations being offered;\n\n       (ii) a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices,\n       or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such\n       goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations\n       to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that\n       making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of\n       such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\n       accommodations;\n\n\n\n       2\n       A “public accommodation” includes a “postgraduate private school.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12181(7)(J).\n                                                6\n\f              Case: 15-13883      Date Filed: 04/06/2016    Page: 7 of 13\n\n\n      (iii) a failure to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no\n      individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or\n      otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the\n      absence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the entity can\n      demonstrate that taking such steps would fundamentally alter the\n      nature of the good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or\n      accommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden; . . .\n\nId. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i-iii) (emphasis added).\n\n      The definition of discrimination provided in Title III covers both tangible\n\nbarriers, that is, physical and architectural barriers that would prevent a disabled\n\nperson from entering an accommodation’s facilities and accessing its goods,\n\nservices and privileges, and intangible barriers, such as discriminatory policies and\n\nprocedures that restrict a disabled person’s ability to enjoy the defendant entity’s\n\ngoods, services and privileges. Rendon v. Valleycrest Prods., 294 F.3d 1279,\n\n1283-84 (11th Cir. 2002).\n\n      Here, J.A.M. failed to state a claim under Title III of ADA. For starters,\n\nJ.A.M. did not plead facts demonstrating that Nova’s actions constituted\n\n“discrimination” under Title III. Nova’s actions do not fall under Title III’s first\n\ndefinition of discrimination. While Nova’s mandatory substance abuse and alcohol\n\nagreement may constitute a readmission criterion that tends to “screen out” certain\n\nindividuals with chronic alcohol-related problems, there is no allegation that this\n\ncriterion was not “necessary for the provision of the . . . services . . . being offered”\n\nby Nova. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i). It is axiomatic that a medical student\n\n\n                                               7\n\f              Case: 15-13883      Date Filed: 04/06/2016     Page: 8 of 13\n\n\nwith alcohol problems would have to abstain from alcohol in order to complete his\n\nstudies. Nova placed alcohol-related conditions on J.A.M. that were necessary to\n\nfacilitate the successful completion of his coursework.\n\n      Nor do Nova’s actions fall under Title III’s second and third definitions of\n\ndiscrimination. While J.A.M. argues that Nova failed to make “reasonable\n\nmodifications” or “take . . . steps . . . to ensure that no individual with a disability\n\nis excluded” (an already specious claim), there is no allegation that making these\n\naccommodations would not “fundamentally alter” the nature of the services\n\nprovided by Nova. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii-iii). Again, it is self-evident that\n\nJ.A.M.’s requested accommodations—repeated medical leaves of absence for\n\nextended amounts of time, exam rescheduling, and excusal of misconduct—would\n\nfundamentally alter his course of study and the skills learned therein. Nova was\n\nunder no obligation to provide accommodations that would fundamentally alter the\n\nnature of its osteopathic medicine program. In fact, the Supreme Court has\n\nrepeatedly admonished courts to respect the academic judgment of universities.\n\nSee, e.g., Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225, 106 S. Ct. 507,\n\n513 (1985) (“When judges are asked to review the substance of a genuinely\n\nacademic decision . . . they should show great respect for the faculty’s professional\n\njudgment.”); Bd. of Curators of the Univ. of Mo. v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 90, 98\n\nS. Ct. 948, 955 (1978) (“[T]he determination whether to dismiss a student for\n\n\n                                                8\n\f              Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016    Page: 9 of 13\n\n\nacademic reasons requires an expert evaluation of cumulative information and is\n\nnot readily adapted to the procedural tools of judicial or administrative\n\ndecisionmaking.”). Accordingly, Nova’s actions did not constitute\n\n“discrimination” under Title III.\n\n      In any event, assuming arguendo that Nova “discriminated against” J.A.M.\n\nand inhibited his “full and equal enjoyment of the . . . services . . . of [Nova]” by\n\nrequiring him to sign a substance abuse agreement and later dismissing him, the\n\ncomplaint contains no allegation that Nova discriminated “on the basis of\n\n[J.A.M.’s] disability.” See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). J.A.M. alleged that his major\n\ndepressive disorder constituted a mental disability. But J.A.M. did not allege that\n\nhe was dismissed because of his mental disability. Rather, he alleged that he was\n\ndismissed because he breached his agreement to abstain from alcohol consumption.\n\nAt best, Nova discriminated on the basis of J.A.M.’s alcohol-related behavioral\n\nmisconduct, not his disability. As such, J.A.M. failed to allege that Nova\n\ndiscriminated against him on account of his disability and, therefore, failed to state\n\na claim under Title III.\n\n      J.A.M.’s argument that the substance abuse and alcohol agreement was a\n\npretext for disability discrimination is without merit. Nova is not required to\n\nexcuse past misconduct, even if that misconduct is linked to a student’s mental\n\ndisability. See Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 465 (4th\n\n\n                                              9\n\f                Case: 15-13883   Date Filed: 04/06/2016   Page: 10 of 13\n\n\nCir. 2012) (“[M]isconduct—even misconduct related to a disability—is not itself a\n\ndisability and may be a basis for dismissal.”) (quotation marks omitted). J.A.M.\n\nbreached the substance abuse and alcohol agreement on at least three separate\n\noccasions. His mental disability does not excuse his misconduct.\n\nC.     Rehabilitation Act Claim\n\n       The Rehabilitation Act provides the following protection for persons facing\n\na disability:\n\n       No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States\n       . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from\n       the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n       discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal\n       financial assistance . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (emphasis added). Discrimination claims under the RA are\n\ngoverned by the same standards used in ADA cases. Cash v. Smith, 231 F.3d\n\n1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). In order to establish a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination under the RA or ADA, the plaintiff must demonstrate that he (1) is\n\ndisabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful\n\ndiscrimination because of his disability. See id.\n\n       An “otherwise qualified” person is one who is able to meet all of a\n\nprogram’s requirements in spite of his handicap. Onishea v. Hopper, 171 F.3d\n\n1289, 1300 (11th Cir. 1999). In the context of postsecondary education, an\n\n“otherwise qualified” individual must be able to meet the academic and technical\n\n\n                                             10\n\f             Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016    Page: 11 of 13\n\n\nstandards requisite to admission or participation in the education program or\n\nactivity, in spite of his handicap. See id.; 34 C.F.R. § 104.3(l)(3).\n\n      In certain circumstances, an educational institution’s refusal to accommodate\n\nthe needs of a disabled person amounts to discrimination against that person\n\nbecause of his disability. See Se. Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 412-13, 99\n\nS. Ct. 2361, 2370 (1979). However, “[the RA] imposes no requirement upon an\n\neducational institution to lower or to effect substantial modifications of standards\n\nto accommodate a handicapped person.” Id. at 413, 99 S. Ct. at 2370-71. Where\n\nthe purpose of an educational program is to train persons to serve their profession\n\nin all customary ways, an institution’s refusal to make “major adjustments” to its\n\nprogram in order to accommodate the disabled does not amount to disability-\n\nrelated discrimination. Id. at 413, 99 S. Ct. at 2370.\n\n      Here, J.A.M.’s RA claim fails for several reasons. First, J.A.M. did not\n\nallege facts demonstrating that Nova dismissed him “solely by reason of . . . his\n\ndisability.” See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). As discussed above, Nova dismissed him due\n\nto his breach of the substance abuse and alcohol agreement, not due to his mental\n\ndisability. J.A.M. alleged no other facts suggesting that Nova dismissed him\n\nbecause of his mental disability, let alone that his mental disability was the sole\n\nreason for dismissal.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f             Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016   Page: 12 of 13\n\n\n      Second, the allegations in the complaint affirmatively demonstrate that\n\nJ.A.M. is not an “otherwise qualified individual” under the RA. See id. His\n\nmental disability renders him wholly unable to participate in Nova’s osteopathic\n\nmedicine program. From 2011 to 2014, he was unable to complete a single full\n\nsemester of medical school without suffering a relapse of his major depressive\n\ndisorder during the semester. These depressive episodes caused him to abuse\n\nalcohol, fail classes, and withdraw from his studies. His disability caused at least\n\nfive hospitalizations for psychiatric stabilization in the course of two years. Even\n\nafter multiple leaves of absence, one lasting as long as seven months, and intensive\n\noutpatient treatment, he repeatedly relapsed and failed to meet Nova’s academic\n\nrequirements. It is clear that J.A.M.’s disability renders him incapable of meeting\n\nthe academic and technical standards required to participate in Nova’s osteopathic\n\nmedicine program. As such, he is not an “otherwise qualified individual” and\n\ncannot state a claim under the RA. See Onishea, 171 F.3d at 1300; 34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 104.3(l)(3).\n\n      Finally, the allegations in the complaint do not establish that Nova refused to\n\naccommodate J.A.M.’s needs in a way that amounted to disability discrimination.\n\nNova gave J.A.M. multiple opportunities to complete his coursework in spite of his\n\nmental disability.

Facts1\n\n       In the fall of 2010, J.A.M. enrolled at Nova’s College of Osteopathic\n\nMedicine and successfully completed his first semester. In April 2011, J.A.M.\n\nexperienced a recurrence of his major depressive disorder. During that episode,\n\nJ.A.M. heavily consumed alcohol for a week and eventually checked into a\n\nhospital for inpatient psychiatric stabilization. Nova granted J.A.M. retroactive\n\nmedical leave and, following the episode, J.A.M. returned to school and\n\nsuccessfully resumed his studies.\n\n       Nova’s Associate Dean for Student Affairs referred J.A.M. to a student\n\nassistance program, which required him to sign a “one-size-fits-all agreement\n\ncalling for random drug tests and abstinence from alcohol.” In the fall of 2011,\n\nJ.A.M. experienced a recurrence of his major depressive disorder, which caused\n\n       1\n        We recount the facts from the allegations in the amended complaint, which we accept as\ntrue and construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.

During this second episode, J.A.M. spent\n\nsix days in a psychiatric hospital. Following his release from the hospital, Nova\n\ninformed J.A.M. that he would have to take a leave of absence and obtain the\n\napproval of the Student Progress Committee to resume his studies. J.A.M. took a\n\nseven-month leave of absence, reenrolled in the fall of 2012, and passed all classes\n\nhe had previously failed.\n\n      In November 2012, J.A.M. suffered a third depressive episode that involved\n\ndrinking and was twice hospitalized for inpatient psychiatric stabilization. During\n\nthe December 2012 winter break, J.A.M. checked himself into a dual-diagnoses\n\ntreatment program. In January 2013, he resumed his classes. In April 2013,\n\nJ.A.M. suffered a fourth depressive episode and was hospitalized for “alcohol-\n\ninvolved psychiatric stabilization.” In sum, from 2011 to 2014, J.A.M. was unable\n\nto complete a single full semester of medical school without suffering a relapse of\n\nhis major depressive disorder during the semester.\n\n      Nova discovered that J.A.M.’s fourth depressive episode involved alcohol\n\nand told him that he would need to take another medical leave of absence. Nova\n\nalso told him that the Student Progress Committee would have to approve his\n\nreadmission. During his third medical leave of absence, J.A.M. underwent a\n\npartial-hospitalization program for 45 days and then moved into a transitional\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f              Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016    Page: 4 of 13\n\n\nliving facility for two months of intensive outpatient therapy and another month of\n\nnormal outpatient therapy.\n\n      At the end of 2013, Nova’s Chair of the Department of Psychiatry examined\n\nJ.A.M. and cleared him to return to school, with monitoring. Notwithstanding this\n\nclearance, Nova required J.A.M. to appear before the Student Progress Committee,\n\nwhose members questioned him about whether he had breached his substance\n\nabuse and alcohol agreement. In response to the committee’s inquiries, J.A.M.\n\nexplained that he had never been to class intoxicated, had never seen a patient\n\nwhile intoxicated, and had never been in any sort of conflict with faculty, staff, or\n\nother students. The committee voted to dismiss J.A.M. from Nova because all four\n\nof his depressive episodes “involved alcohol.” The committee’s recommendation\n\nwas accepted by the dean and affirmed by Nova’s internal appeals process.\n\nB.    Procedural History\n\n      On April 10, 2015, J.A.M. filed a counseled, two-count amended complaint\n\n(the “complaint”) in federal district court against Nova, alleging (1) disability\n\ndiscrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 794(a) (Count I), and (2) disability discrimination under Title III of the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) (Count II).\n\nJ.A.M. alleged that Nova excluded him from participation in the College of\n\nOsteopathic Medicine due to his mental illness and, therefore, “discriminated\n\n\n                                              4\n\f              Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016   Page: 5 of 13\n\n\nagainst him solely by reason of his disability,” in violation of the RA. J.A.M.\n\nfurther alleged that Nova “dismissed him . . . in reliance on his being mentally\n\ndisabled,” in violation of the ADA.\n\n      On April 16, 2015, Nova filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure\n\nto state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In an\n\nAugust 12, 2015 order, the district court granted Nova’s motion and dismissed the\n\ncomplaint. J.A.M. appealed.\n\n                                 II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review de novo the district court’s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to state a claim. Cinotto v.

When evaluating a motion to dismiss, a court looks to see\n\nwhether the complaint contains sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a\n\nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.

ADA Title III Claim\n\n       Title III of the ADA sets forth a general rule against disability-based\n\ndiscrimination in public accommodations 2:\n\n       No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability\n       in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities,\n       privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public\n       accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or\n       operates a place of public accommodation.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) (emphasis added). Title III also sets forth a statutory\n\ndefinition of “discrimination,” which includes, inter alia:\n\n       (i) the imposition or application of eligibility criteria that screen out\n       or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any class of\n       individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any\n       goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations,\n       unless such criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of\n       the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\n       accommodations being offered;\n\n       (ii) a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices,\n       or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such\n       goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations\n       to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that\n       making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of\n       such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\n       accommodations;\n\n\n\n       2\n       A “public accommodation” includes a “postgraduate private school.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12181(7)(J).\n                                                6\n\f              Case: 15-13883      Date Filed: 04/06/2016    Page: 7 of 13\n\n\n      (iii) a failure to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no\n      individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or\n      otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the\n      absence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the entity can\n      demonstrate that taking such steps would fundamentally alter the\n      nature of the good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or\n      accommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden; . . .\n\nId. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i-iii) (emphasis added).\n\n      The definition of discrimination provided in Title III covers both tangible\n\nbarriers, that is, physical and architectural barriers that would prevent a disabled\n\nperson from entering an accommodation’s facilities and accessing its goods,\n\nservices and privileges, and intangible barriers, such as discriminatory policies and\n\nprocedures that restrict a disabled person’s ability to enjoy the defendant entity’s\n\ngoods, services and privileges.

Valleycrest Prods., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75876\"><a href=\"/opinion/75876/sergio-rendon-v-valleycrest-productions-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1283-84 (11th Cir. 2002).\n\n      Here, J.A.M. failed to state a claim under Title III of ADA. For starters,\n\nJ.A.M. did not plead facts demonstrating that Nova’s actions constituted\n\n“discrimination” under Title III. Nova’s actions do not fall under Title III’s first\n\ndefinition of discrimination. While Nova’s mandatory substance abuse and alcohol\n\nagreement may constitute a readmission criterion that tends to “screen out” certain\n\nindividuals with chronic alcohol-related problems, there is no allegation that this\n\ncriterion was not “necessary for the provision of the . . . services . . . being offered”\n\nby Nova. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i). It is axiomatic that a medical student\n\n\n                                               7\n\f              Case: 15-13883      Date Filed: 04/06/2016     Page: 8 of 13\n\n\nwith alcohol problems would have to abstain from alcohol in order to complete his\n\nstudies. Nova placed alcohol-related conditions on J.A.M. that were necessary to\n\nfacilitate the successful completion of his coursework.\n\n      Nor do Nova’s actions fall under Title III’s second and third definitions of\n\ndiscrimination. While J.A.M. argues that Nova failed to make “reasonable\n\nmodifications” or “take . . . steps . . . to ensure that no individual with a disability\n\nis excluded” (an already specious claim), there is no allegation that making these\n\naccommodations would not “fundamentally alter” the nature of the services\n\nprovided by Nova. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii-iii). Again, it is self-evident that\n\nJ.A.M.’s requested accommodations—repeated medical leaves of absence for\n\nextended amounts of time, exam rescheduling, and excusal of misconduct—would\n\nfundamentally alter his course of study and the skills learned therein. Nova was\n\nunder no obligation to provide accommodations that would fundamentally alter the\n\nnature of its osteopathic medicine program. In fact, the Supreme Court has\n\nrepeatedly admonished courts to respect the academic judgment of universities.\n\nSee, e.g., Regents of Univ. of Mich. v.

Accordingly, Nova’s actions did not constitute\n\n“discrimination” under Title III.\n\n      In any event, assuming arguendo that Nova “discriminated against” J.A.M.\n\nand inhibited his “full and equal enjoyment of the . . . services . . . of [Nova]” by\n\nrequiring him to sign a substance abuse agreement and later dismissing him, the\n\ncomplaint contains no allegation that Nova discriminated “on the basis of\n\n[J.A.M.’s] disability.” See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). J.A.M. alleged that his major\n\ndepressive disorder constituted a mental disability. But J.A.M. did not allege that\n\nhe was dismissed because of his mental disability. Rather, he alleged that he was\n\ndismissed because he breached his agreement to abstain from alcohol consumption.\n\nAt best, Nova discriminated on the basis of J.A.M.’s alcohol-related behavioral\n\nmisconduct, not his disability. As such, J.A.M. failed to allege that Nova\n\ndiscriminated against him on account of his disability and, therefore, failed to state\n\na claim under Title III.\n\n      J.A.M.’s argument that the substance abuse and alcohol agreement was a\n\npretext for disability discrimination is without merit. Nova is not required to\n\nexcuse past misconduct, even if that misconduct is linked to a student’s mental\n\ndisability. See Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ.

Where\n\nthe purpose of an educational program is to train persons to serve their profession\n\nin all customary ways, an institution’s refusal to make “major adjustments” to its\n\nprogram in order to accommodate the disabled does not amount to disability-\n\nrelated discrimination. Id. at 413, 99 S. Ct. at 2370.\n\n      Here, J.A.M.’s RA claim fails for several reasons. First, J.A.M. did not\n\nallege facts demonstrating that Nova dismissed him “solely by reason of . . . his\n\ndisability.” See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). As discussed above, Nova dismissed him due\n\nto his breach of the substance abuse and alcohol agreement, not due to his mental\n\ndisability. J.A.M. alleged no other facts suggesting that Nova dismissed him\n\nbecause of his mental disability, let alone that his mental disability was the sole\n\nreason for dismissal.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f             Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016   Page: 12 of 13\n\n\n      Second, the allegations in the complaint affirmatively demonstrate that\n\nJ.A.M. is not an “otherwise qualified individual” under the RA. See id. His\n\nmental disability renders him wholly unable to participate in Nova’s osteopathic\n\nmedicine program. From 2011 to 2014, he was unable to complete a single full\n\nsemester of medical school without suffering a relapse of his major depressive\n\ndisorder during the semester. These depressive episodes caused him to abuse\n\nalcohol, fail classes, and withdraw from his studies. His disability caused at least\n\nfive hospitalizations for psychiatric stabilization in the course of two years. Even\n\nafter multiple leaves of absence, one lasting as long as seven months, and intensive\n\noutpatient treatment, he repeatedly relapsed and failed to meet Nova’s academic\n\nrequirements. It is clear that J.A.M.’s disability renders him incapable of meeting\n\nthe academic and technical standards required to participate in Nova’s osteopathic\n\nmedicine program. As such, he is not an “otherwise qualified individual” and\n\ncannot state a claim under the RA. See Onishea, 171 F.3d at 1300; 34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 104.3(l)(3).\n\n      Finally, the allegations in the complaint do not establish that Nova refused to\n\naccommodate J.A.M.’s needs in a way that amounted to disability discrimination.\n\nNova gave J.A.M. multiple opportunities to complete his coursework in spite of his\n\nmental disability. Nova allowed him to take two medical leaves of absence, retake\n\nexaminations, and even referred him to professionals for treatment. It was not until\n\n\n                                             12\n\f             Case: 15-13883     Date Filed: 04/06/2016   Page: 13 of 13\n\n\nJ.A.M.’s fourth depressive episode in three years that Nova determined that\n\ndismissal was appropriate. As if it had not done so already, Nova would have\n\nneeded to make “major adjustments” to its osteopathic medicine program to\n\ncontinue accommodating J.A.M. See Davis, 442 U.S. at 413, 99 S. Ct. at 2370.\n\nThe RA imposes no such obligation and, therefore, Nova did not discriminate\n\nagainst J.A.M. because of his disability.\n\n                               III. CONCLUSION\n\n      In light of the foregoing, we affirm the district court’s order dismissing\n\nPlaintiff J.A.M.’s amended complaint.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f</pre>",
