Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and record. See\nFed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).\n\fNo. 06-3677                                                                    Page 2\n\nfor purposes of this appeal, fell into three categories. First, they alleged that the\nWisconsin Parole Commission (“the Commission”), as a state agency, violated Title\nII of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.,\nby denying them parole and excluding them from prison programs because of their\nhistories of drug or alcohol addiction. Second, al Ghashiyah individually alleged\nthat Lieutenant John P. Grahl, Captain Bruce Muraski, and Captain Patricia L.\nGarro, all prison guards, impeded his access to the courts and committed the state-\nlaw tort of abuse of process by placing him in segregated disciplinary detention\nbased on a report that they knew was false, and all with the intent of depriving him\nof access to his legal materials.1 Al Ghashiyah further alleged that this lack of\nready access caused him to lose three unspecified cases that he then had pending\nbefore the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin. Finally, al Ghashiyah brought four\nadditional separate claims for relief based on purported violations of his rights to\ndue process and equal protection. Specifically, he alleged that (1) inmate complaint\nexaminers refused to process his prison grievance complaints because he refused to\nsign them with the name under which he is convicted, John Albert Casteel; (2) on\nseparate occasions members of a prison disciplinary board impermissibly relied on\nallegedly fabricated evidence to find him guilty of violating various prison\nregulations; (3) the Commission failed to reinstate him to his job as prison barber\nand to reimburse him for back wages after purportedly being ordered to do so by\nstate courts; and (4) several prison guards harassed him.\n\n       After the state filed a motion for summary judgment, the district court\nrejected all of al Ghashiyah’s individual due-process and equal-protection claims.\nSpecifically, the court determined that: (1) the inmate complaint examiners were\nabsolutely immune from suit as an adjudicatory body; (2) al Ghashiyah had an\nadequate post-deprivation state remedy to challenge the prison disciplinary board’s\ndecisions; and (3) he failed to exhaust his remedies against the prison guards\n(against whom he claimed harassment) and the Commission (for its failure to\nreinstate him to his barber position) through the WDOC’s written grievance\nprocedure. However, the court allowed the ADA claim and al Ghashiyah’s access-\nto-courts claim to proceed.\n       In November 2005 the state filed a second motion for summary judgment on\n\n\n      1\n         In his complaint, al Ghashiyah also alleged that a prison guard named J.D.\nSmith acted with Lieutenant Grahl, Captain Muraski, and Captain Garro to restrict\nhis access to the courts. The district court separately dismissed al Ghashiyah’s claim\nas to Smith, a determination that al Ghashiyah does not challenge on appeal.\nAl Ghashiyah thus waives any argument as to the district court’s decision regarding\nSmith, see Williams v. REP Corp., 302 F.3d 660, 666 (7th Cir. 2002), and we\naccordingly will limit our examination of al Ghashiyah’s access-to-courts claim to his\nallegations regarding Grahl, Muraski, and Garro.\n\fNo. 06-3677                                                                      Page 3\n\nthese remaining claims. In addressing the ADA claim, the state argued that the\nplaintiffs were not disabled, and, in any case, were denied parole or excluded from\nprison programs for reasons other than their purported disabilities. As to\nal Ghashiyah, the state submitted documents reflecting that, on multiple occasions,\nhe was denied parole and the chance to participate in prison programs because,\namong other reasons: he had not served sufficient time to be released on parole; his\nhistory of recidivism suggested that his release would constitute an unreasonable\nrisk to the public; and his behavior and general attitude while incarcerated were\ndeficient. In opposing al Ghashiyah’s access-to-courts claim, the state argued that\nhe failed to produce evidence that Lieutenant Grahl, Captain Muraski, or Captain\nGarro restricted his access to his legal materials, and submitted affidavits from the\nthree guards in which they attested that they had not.\n\n       In response, al Ghashiyah argued that the decisions to deny him parole were\nbased on information that was “constitutionally tainted and false.” He also asserted\nin an attached affidavit that he knew from his “own personal experiences” that\nLieutenant Grahl, Captain Muraski, and Captain Garro intended to hinder his\naccess to his legal materials, and that their actions led to the dismissal of “three (3)\nimportant cases.”\n\n       The district court granted the state’s motion for summary judgment. The\ncourt ruled that al Ghashiyah and his co-plaintiffs failed to submit any evidence “to\nprove that any of them was a person with a disability who was otherwise qualified\nfor parole release, and who was denied parole release solely due to an alleged\ndisability.” The court also rejected al Ghashiyah’s access-to-courts claim on the\nground that he failed to show that Lieutenant Grahl, Captain Muraski, or Captain\nGarro knew that al Ghashiyah was placed in disciplinary detention on false\ncharges. The court, however, did not address whether Grahl, Muraski, or Garro\ncommitted abuse of process.\n\n       On appeal al Ghashiyah asks us to reverse the district court’s actions on the\nADA claim, the access-to-court and abuse-of-process claims, and his individual\nclaims for violation of his rights to due process and equal protection. Because we\nreview the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo, see Johnson v.\nDoughty, 433 F.3d 1001, 1009 (7th Cir. 2006), we may affirm on any basis supported\nby the record, see EEOC v. Target Corp., 460 F.3d 946, 959 (7th Cir. 2006); Hill v.\nAm. Gen. Fin., Inc., 218 F.3d 639, 642 (7th Cir. 2000). And in reviewing the record\nwe examine whether the moving party—the state in this case—demonstrates that\n“there is no genuine issue as to any material fact” that it is entitled “to judgment as\na matter of law,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n322-23 (1986), construing all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of\nal Ghashiyah as the non-moving party, see Cardoso v. Robert Bosch Corp., 427 F.3d\n429, 432 (7th Cir. 2005).\n\fNo. 06-3677                                                                       Page 4\n\n\n       We first address al Ghashiyah’s ADA claim. Because al Ghashiyah’s\nco-plaintiffs have not appealed, we examine his individual claim only. See Am.\nFed’n of Gov’t Employees, Local 2119 v. Cohen, 171 F.3d 460, 467 (7th Cir. 1999)\n(“‘[T]he plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and\ncannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.’”\n(quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975))); see also Navin v. Park Ridge\nSch. Dist., 270 F.3d 1147, 1149 (7th Cir. 2001) (stating that pro se litigants lack\nauthority to represent the interests of other parties). As pertinent here, al\nGhashiyah shoulders the burden of establishing that he has a disability, and that\nthe Commission denied him parole or the opportunity to participate in other prison\nprograms because of that disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Radaszewski ex rel.\nRadaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599, 606-07 (7th Cir. 2004); Cassidy v. Ind. Dep’t\nof Corrs., 199 F.3d 374, 375 (7th Cir. 2000). He asserts that he is disabled under\nthe ADA due to his history of drug addiction, which, as he claimed in his complaint,\n“substantially limit[s] [his] judgment, ability to learn, ability to comprehend the\nlong-range effects of [his] acts, and ability to maintain a stable social relationship.”\n\n       As a threshold matter, al Ghashiyah has failed to produce any evidence to\nsubstantiate his allegation that his past drug addiction is a disability. Past drug\naddiction is protected under the ADA only when it “substantially limits one or more\nmajor life activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A)-(B); see also 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.104(1)(ii),\n(3), 35.131(a)(2); Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 896 (9th Cir. 2002). Although\nwe may assume in this instance that “learning,” “comprehending,” and maintaining\n“stable social relationships” are major life activities, al Ghashiyah has produced no\nevidence, medical or otherwise, that his past addictions negatively affect these\naspects of his life. See Stein v. Ashcroft, 284 F.3d 721, 726 (7th Cir. 2002) (rejecting\nclaim that impairment limited plaintiff’s major life activities because plaintiff failed\nto support claim with medical evidence); Contreras v. Suncast Corp., 237 F.3d 756,\n763 (7th Cir. 2001) (stating that it is plaintiff’s burden on summary judgment to\ndemonstrate he can “come up with evidence to show he could meet his ultimate\nburden of showing [a] . . . recognized disability”). Given the absence of evidence\nshowing that al Ghashiyah qualified for ADA protection, the district court was\ncorrect to reject the claim on summary judgment. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252;\nHammel v. Eau Galle Cheese Factory, 407 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2005) (“Summary\njudgment is not a dress rehearsal or practice run; it is the put up or shut up\nmoment in a lawsuit, when a party must show what evidence it has that would\nconvince a trier of fact to accept its version of the events.” (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted)).\n\n       The district court also was correct to reject al Ghashiyah’s access-to-courts\nclaim, but for reasons other than those the court articulated. See Target Corp., 460\n\fNo. 06-3677                                                                    Page 5\n\nF.3d at 959. For al Ghashiyah to proceed on this claim, he must produce evidence\nshowing that Lieutenant Grahl, Captain Muraski, and Captain Garro hindered his\nability to pursue either a nonfrivolous challenge to his conviction or sentence, or an\narguable civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S.\n343, 352-54 & 353 n.3 (1996); see also Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 414-15\n(2002); Lehn v. Holmes, 364 F.3d 862, 868 (7th Cir. 2002). At summary judgment\nal Ghashiyah submitted an affidavit in which he attested that, because of the prison\nguards’ actions, he lost three “important” cases he then had pending before the\nWisconsin appellate court. But he did not name these cases, provide the cases’\ndocket numbers, or even describe the nature of his claims; in short, he produced no\nadmissible evidence showing that the cases were not frivolous and fell within the\ncategory of actions (civil rights actions or attacks on his conviction or sentence)\nprotected by the right to access courts. See Lewis, 518 U.S. at 352-54 & 353 n.3.\nAl Ghashiyah’s access-to-courts claim thus fails as a matter of law. See id.; see also\nHarbury, 536 U.S. at 414-15. And because the district court properly rejected the\nclaim, it did not err by not addressing al Ghashiyah’s pendent state-law claim that\nGrahl, Muraski, and Garro committed abuse of process. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3);\nWilliams Elec. Games, Inc. v. Garrity, 479 F.3d 904, 907 (7th Cir. 2007).\n\n       Al Ghashiyah’s remaining arguments warrant little discussion. The inmate\ncomplaint examiners are immune from suit. See Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S.\n259, 268-69 (1993); Walrath v. United States, 35 F.3d 277, 281-82 (7th Cir. 1994); cf.\nTobin for Governor v. Ill. State Bd. of Elections, 268 F.3d 517, 521-22 (7th Cir.\n2001). Al Ghashiyah’s due-process claim against the members of the prison\ndisciplinary board fails because he had an adequate post-deprivation state remedy\nto challenge the board’s decisions in the form of a writ of certiorari from the state\ncircuit court. See Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 132 (1990); Hamlin v.\nVaudenberg, 95 F.3d 580, 585 (7th Cir. 1996); State v. Goulette, 222 N.W.2d 622,\n626 (Wis. 1974). Finally, the district court properly dismissed al Ghashiyah’s\nclaims against the guards for harassment and against the Commission for failing to\nreinstate him to his barber position; there is no evidence to support his bare\nassertion on appeal that prison guards kept him from satisfying WDOC’s written\ngrievance procedure before filing suit. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Wis. Admin. Code\nDOC §§ 310.05, 310.07; Dixon v. Page, 291 F.3d 485, 489-91 (7th Cir. 2002); see also\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 252; Hammel, 407 F.3d at 859.\n\n                                                                         AFFIRMED.\n\f",

In opposing al Ghashiyah’s access-to-courts claim, the state argued that\nhe failed to produce evidence that Lieutenant Grahl, Captain Muraski, or Captain\nGarro restricted his access to his legal materials, and submitted affidavits from the\nthree guards in which they attested that they had not.\n\n       In response, al Ghashiyah argued that the decisions to deny him parole were\nbased on information that was “constitutionally tainted and false.” He also asserted\nin an attached affidavit that he knew from his “own personal experiences” that\nLieutenant Grahl, Captain Muraski, and Captain Garro intended to hinder his\naccess to his legal materials, and that their actions led to the dismissal of “three (3)\nimportant cases.”\n\n       The district court granted the state’s motion for summary judgment. The\ncourt ruled that al Ghashiyah and his co-plaintiffs failed to submit any evidence “to\nprove that any of them was a person with a disability who was otherwise qualified\nfor parole release, and who was denied parole release solely due to an alleged\ndisability.” The court also rejected al Ghashiyah’s access-to-courts claim on the\nground that he failed to show that Lieutenant Grahl, Captain Muraski, or Captain\nGarro knew that al Ghashiyah was placed in disciplinary detention on false\ncharges. The court, however, did not address whether Grahl, Muraski, or Garro\ncommitted abuse of process.\n\n       On appeal al Ghashiyah asks us to reverse the district court’s actions on the\nADA claim, the access-to-court and abuse-of-process claims, and his individual\nclaims for violation of his rights to due process and equal protection.

Because al Ghashiyah’s\nco-plaintiffs have not appealed, we examine his individual claim only. See Am.\nFed’n of Gov’t Employees, Local 2119 v.

As pertinent here, al\nGhashiyah shoulders the burden of establishing that he has a disability, and that\nthe Commission denied him parole or the opportunity to participate in other prison\nprograms because of that disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Radaszewski ex rel.\nRadaszewski v. Maram, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787732\"><a href=\"/opinion/787732/donna-radaszewski-guardian-on-behalf-of-eric-radaszewski-v-barry-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606-07 (7th Cir. 2004); Cassidy v.

He asserts that he is disabled under\nthe ADA due to his history of drug addiction, which, as he claimed in his complaint,\n“substantially limit[s] [his] judgment, ability to learn, ability to comprehend the\nlong-range effects of [his] acts, and ability to maintain a stable social relationship.”\n\n       As a threshold matter, al Ghashiyah has failed to produce any evidence to\nsubstantiate his allegation that his past drug addiction is a disability. Past drug\naddiction is protected under the ADA only when it “substantially limits one or more\nmajor life activities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A)-(B); see also 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.104(1)(ii),\n(3), 35.131(a)(2); Thompson v.

Although\nwe may assume in this instance that “learning,” “comprehending,” and maintaining\n“stable social relationships” are major life activities, al Ghashiyah has produced no\nevidence, medical or otherwise, that his past addictions negatively affect these\naspects of his life. See Stein v.

Given the absence of evidence\nshowing that al Ghashiyah qualified for ADA protection, the district court was\ncorrect to reject the claim on summary judgment. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252;\nHammel v. Eau Galle Cheese Factory, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790216\"><a href=\"/opinion/790216/paul-s-hammel-cross-appellee-v-eau-galle-cheese-factory/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 859 (7th Cir. 2005) (“Summary\njudgment is not a dress rehearsal or practice run; it is the put up or shut up\nmoment in a lawsuit, when a party must show what evidence it has that would\nconvince a trier of fact to accept its version of the events.” (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted)).\n\n       The district court also was correct to reject al Ghashiyah’s access-to-courts\nclaim, but for reasons other than those the court articulated. See Target Corp., 460\n\fNo. 06-3677                                                                    Page 5\n\nF.3d at 959. For al Ghashiyah to proceed on this claim, he must produce evidence\nshowing that Lieutenant Grahl, Captain Muraski, and Captain Garro hindered his\nability to pursue either a nonfrivolous challenge to his conviction or sentence, or an\narguable civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Lewis v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352-54 & 353 n.3 (1996); see also Christopher v.

At summary judgment\nal Ghashiyah submitted an affidavit in which he attested that, because of the prison\nguards’ actions, he lost three “important” cases he then had pending before the\nWisconsin appellate court. But he did not name these cases, provide the cases’\ndocket numbers, or even describe the nature of his claims; in short, he produced no\nadmissible evidence showing that the cases were not frivolous and fell within the\ncategory of actions (civil rights actions or attacks on his conviction or sentence)\nprotected by the right to access courts. See Lewis, 518 U.S. at 352-54 & 353 n.3.\nAl Ghashiyah’s access-to-courts claim thus fails as a matter of law. See id.; see also\nHarbury, 536 U.S. at 414-15. And because the district court properly rejected the\nclaim, it did not err by not addressing al Ghashiyah’s pendent state-law claim that\nGrahl, Muraski, and Garro committed abuse of process. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3);\nWilliams Elec. Games, Inc. v.

Al Ghashiyah’s due-process claim against the members of the prison\ndisciplinary board fails because he had an adequate post-deprivation state remedy\nto challenge the board’s decisions in the form of a writ of certiorari from the state\ncircuit court.
