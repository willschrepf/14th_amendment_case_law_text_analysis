(Urban) appeals a final judgment entered after a jury\n\ntrial in a suit it initiated against Chris Drummond in which no party received any\n\naward of damages, but in which Drummond was awarded attorney’s fees. In five\n\nissues, Urban contends that: (1) the trial court erroneously awarded attorney’s fees\n\nto Drummond and denied Urban’s motion to disregard the jury’s finding on\n\fattorney’s fees to Drummond, (2) alternatively, if Drummond was entitled to recover\n\nattorney’s fees, a remittitur is appropriate, because the amount of attorney’s fees\n\nawarded is excessive and the evidence was factually and legally insufficient to\n\nsupport it, (3) the trial court erred by refusing to award Urban its attorney’s fees in\n\nthe amount found by the jury, (4) the trial court erred by denying Urban’s amended\n\nmotion for sanctions which sought mandatory statutory attorney’s fees under the\n\nTexas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) and Texas Debt Collection Act\n\n(TDCA) and attorney’s fees as sanctions pursuant to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n13 and 215 and Chapters 9 and 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nand (5) the trial court erred in refusing to award Urban its appellate attorney’s fees\n\nas a matter of law. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      Chris Drummond signed a Residential Buyer/Tenant Representation\n\nAgreement (the Agreement) in 2011 in which Drummond agreed to “work\n\nexclusively through [Urban] in acquiring property” in the Houston market area for a\n\nsix-month period. Under the terms of the Agreement, Urban was entitled to a\n\ncommission based on the gross sales price of the property Drummond agreed to\n\npurchase in the market area, and the commission became payable when the\n\ntransaction closed or when Drummond breached the Agreement, whichever occurred\n\nfirst. The Agreement further stated that in the event Drummond defaulted on the\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fAgreement, Drummond “will be liable for the amount of compensation that [Urban]\n\nwould have received under this agreement if [Urban] was not in default.” The\n\nAgreement also contained the following attorney’s fees provision:\n\n      ATTORNEY’S FEES: If Client or Broker is a prevailing party in any\n      legal proceeding brought as a result of a dispute under this agreement\n      or any transaction related to this agreement, such party will be entitled\n      to recover from the non-prevailing party all costs of such proceeding\n      and reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n      Drummond purchased a home in Houston through another realtor during\n\nUrban’s six-month exclusive period. Urban filed a breach of contract claim against\n\nDrummond to collect the commission and attorney’s fees as provided for in the\n\nAgreement. Drummond answered and asserted numerous affirmative defenses to\n\nUrban’s breach of contract claim, including breach of fiduciary duty, and ten\n\ncounterclaims against Urban, including a “counterclaim” for breach of the\n\nAgreement and a counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty based exclusively upon\n\nUrban’s conduct prior to execution of the Agreement. Drummond also filed\n\nthird-party claims against Urban’s counsel (Chris Di Ferrante), Urban’s President\n\nand CEO (Vinod Ramani), and an Urban employee (George Silaski). Urban later\n\nadded claims for fraud, and statutory attorney’s fees under section 17.50(c) of the\n\nDTPA and section 15.21 of the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act (TFEA).\n\n      Drummond nonsuited his third-party actions without prejudice and Urban\n\ndismissed its fraud claim against Drummond before trial. Urban also obtained\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fsummary judgment on several of Drummond’s counterclaims and affirmative\n\ndefenses prior to trial, and the trial court refused to submit jury questions on several\n\nothers.1 The only questions submitted to the jury pertained to Urban’s breach of\n\ncontract claim and Drummond’s affirmative defense of breach of fiduciary duty.2\n\nThe jury was asked: (1) whether Urban or Drummond failed to comply with the\n\nAgreement, (2) if both Urban and Drummond failed to comply, who failed to\n\nmaterially comply first, (3) if Urban failed to materially comply first, was Urban’s\n\nfailure to comply excused, and (4) what amount of damages, if any, Urban was\n\nentitled to as a result of Drummond’s failure to materially comply with the\n\nAgreement. The jury was also asked to decide whether Urban had breached its\n\nfiduciary duty to Drummond after Drummond executed the Agreement, and to\n\ndetermine a reasonable amount of attorney’s fees for both parties through trial and\n\n\n\n\n1\n      Although they were set forth in his live pleading at trial, several of Drummond’s\n      other counterclaims and affirmative defenses were never expressly disposed of by\n      the court (e.g., Drummond’s counterclaim for class relief).\n2\n      In his live pleading Drummond alleged: (1) breach of fiduciary duty as an\n      affirmative defense to Urban’s breach of contract claim; and (2) a counterclaim\n      against Urban for breach of fiduciary duty. Drummond’s counterclaim for breach of\n      fiduciary duty is based exclusively upon Urban’s actions prior to and\n      contemporaneous with the execution of the Agreement. The jury, however, was only\n      asked to determine if Urban complied with its fiduciary duties to Drummond after\n      Drummond executed the Agreement. Thus, the record reflects that the court’s\n      charge included a question on Drummond’s affirmative defense to Urban’s breach\n      of contract claim, not a question on Drummond’s breach of fiduciary duty claim, as\n      Urban argues on appeal.\n\n                                           4\n\fon appeal. No damages question was submitted to the jury with respect to\n\nDrummond.\n\n      The jury found that both Drummond and Urban failed to comply with the\n\nAgreement, Urban failed to materially comply first, Urban’s failure to materially\n\ncomply was not excused, and Urban did not comply with its fiduciary duty to\n\nDrummond. The jury found that Urban incurred zero damages. The jury also found\n\nthat a reasonable amount for Urban’s attorney’s fees was $74,649 through trial and\n\nzero on appeal, and that a reasonable amount for Drummond’s attorney’s fees was\n\n$110,000 through trial and $60,000 on appeal.\n\n      The trial court rendered a final judgment based on the jury verdict that ordered\n\nthat Urban take nothing on its claims against Drummond, and awarded Drummond\n\n$110,000 in attorney’s fees through trial, plus an additional $60,000 in conditional\n\nappellate attorney’s fees. The award of attorney’s fees was premised on the trial\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Drummond was the “prevailing party” under the Agreement\n\nand Urban was the “non-prevailing party.”\n\n      Urban filed a timely motion to disregard the jury’s findings and a motion for\n\nnew trial. Urban also filed a post-trial amended motion for sanctions which sought\n\nmandatory statutory attorney’s fees under the DTPA, the TFEA, the TDCA, and\n\nattorney’s fees as sanctions under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 13 and 215 and\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapters 9 and 10. The trial court denied\n\nall three motions.\n\n      This appeal followed.\n\n        Breach of Contract “Counterclaim” and Prior Material Breach\n\n      Urban raises arguments in its first appellate issue that are premised in part\n\nupon the following two assertions: (1) Drummond pleaded a “counterclaim” against\n\nUrban for breach of contract, and (2) the trial court granted summary judgment in\n\nUrban’s favor on Drummond’s affirmative defense of prior material breach.\n\nA.    Drummond’s Breach of Contract “Counterclaim”\n\n      Urban contends that Drummond pleaded a “counterclaim” against Urban for\n\nbreach of contract. Drummond responds that he only asserted an affirmative defense\n\nto Urban’s breach of contract claim, not a separate counterclaim.\n\n      The record reflects that Drummond pleaded what he denoted as a\n\n“counterclaim” for breach of contract in his live pleading, as well as an affirmative\n\ndefense to Urban’s breach of contract claim, both of which were premised on the\n\nsame reasoning, i.e., that Urban breached the Agreement by failing to use best efforts\n\nin representing Drummond after the Agreement was executed. Because Urban did\n\nnot challenge Drummond’s pleading by special exceptions, we must liberally\n\nconstrue the pleading in Drummond’s favor. See Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v.\n\nAuld, 34 S.W.3d 887, 897 (Tex. 2000); cf. CKB & Assocs., Inc. v. Moore\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fMcCormack Petroleum, Inc., 809 S.W.2d 577, 586 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1991, writ\n\ndenied) (“A pleading that gives adequate notice will not fail merely because the\n\ndraftsman named it improperly.”).\n\n      Drummond’s purported “counterclaim” did not ask for damages as a result of\n\nthe alleged breach, and, instead, argued that Urban’s prior breach excused him from\n\npaying any commission under the Agreement. See generally Compass Bank v. MFP\n\nFin. Servs., Inc., 152 S.W.3d 844, 852 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, pet. denied)\n\n(excuse based upon prior material breach is affirmative defense). We liberally\n\nconstrue Drummond’s purported “counterclaim” for breach of contract as an\n\naffirmative defense to Urban’s breach of contract claim.\n\nB.    Prior Material Breach\n\n      Urban also contends that the trial court granted summary judgment in its favor\n\non Drummond’s affirmative defense of prior material breach, thus foreclosing\n\nDrummond from arguing that affirmative defense at trial. The record reflects,\n\nhowever, that the parties debated the scope of the summary judgment order during a\n\npretrial hearing and, at that hearing, the trial judge clarified her earlier summary\n\njudgment ruling and stated that “prior breach by Urban is still a viable affirmative\n\ndefense” for Drummond. Thus, Drummond’s affirmative defense that he was\n\nexcused from performance under the contract based on Urban’s prior material breach\n\nhad not been disposed of by the court by the time of trial.\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      Having resolved these preliminary matters, we will now address Urban’s\n\nappellate complaints.\n\n                Award of Attorney’s Fees Pursuant to Agreement\n\n      In its first issue, Urban contends that the trial court erred by awarding\n\nattorney’s fees to Drummond because Drummond is not a “prevailing party” under\n\nthe Agreement.3 Drummond requested an award of attorney’s fees based exclusively\n\nupon the Agreement’s attorney’s fee provision. See Epps v. Fowler, 351 S.W.3d 862,\n\n865 (Tex. 2011) (citing Intercontinental Grp. P’ship v. KB Home Lone Star L.P.,\n\n\n3\n      Whether a party is entitled to seek an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to a statute\n      or contract is a question of law that we review de novo. See Peterson Grp., Inc. v.\n      PLTQ Lotus Grp., L.P., 417 S.W.3d 46, 59 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013,\n      pet. denied) (statute); Goldman v. Olmstead, 414 S.W.3d 346, 365–66 (Tex. App.—\n      Dallas 2013, pet. denied) (prevailing party provision in contract). A trial court’s\n      decision to award attorney’s fees, however, is generally reviewed for an abuse of\n      discretion. The First and Fourteenth Courts of Appeals, however, have recently\n      addressed whether a trial court’s decision to award attorney’s fees to a “prevailing\n      party” under a contractual attorney’s fee provision should be reviewed under a de\n      novo or abuse of discretion standard. See N. Star Water Logic, LLC v. Ecolotron,\n      Inc., No. 14-14-00972-CV, 2016 WL 402072, at *1 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n      Dist.] Feb. 2, 2016, no pet.); see also Referente v. City View Courtyard, L.P., No.\n      01–14–00602–CV, 2015 WL 6081428, at *2–3 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n      Oct. 13, 2015, no pet.). In those cases, the courts held that a trial court’s decision to\n      grant or deny attorney’s fees under a contract’s “prevailing party” clause when the\n      plaintiff has nonsuited its claims without prejudice is a mixed question of law and\n      fact. N. Star Water Logic, 2016 WL 402072, at *1; Referente, 2015 WL 6081428,\n      at *2–3. In such cases, a trial court’s decision that a party nonsuited to avoid an\n      unfavorable ruling is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, deferring to any factual\n      findings supported by some evidence, and legal questions involved in that decision\n      are reviewed de novo. Referente, 2015 WL 6081428, at *2–3. Although Urban\n      argues that de novo review is the appropriate standard in this case, we need not\n      decide this issue because regardless of which standard of review we employ, our\n      holding would be the same.\n\n\n                                              8\n\f295 S.W.3d 650, 653 (Tex. 2009) (stating that Texas litigants can only recover\n\nattorney’s fees if statute or contract specifically provides for such recovery)). The\n\nAgreement states in relevant part that if Drummond “is a prevailing party in any\n\nlegal proceeding brought as a result of a dispute under this agreement or any\n\ntransaction related to this agreement, [Drummond] will be entitled to recover from\n\nthe non-prevailing party all costs of such proceeding and reasonable attorney’s fees.”\n\nA.    Applicable Law\n\n      1.     Contract Interpretation\n\n      When construing a contract, our primary concern is to ascertain the intentions\n\nof the parties as expressed in the document. Amedisys, Inc. v. Kingwood Home\n\nHealth Care, LLC, 437 S.W.3d 507, 514 (Tex. 2014). We begin our analysis with\n\nthe language of the contract because it is the best representation of what the parties\n\nmutually intended. Gilbert Tex. Constr., L.P. v. Underwriters at Lloyd’s London,\n\n327 S.W.3d 118, 126 (Tex. 2010). Unless the contract dictates otherwise, we give\n\nwords and phrases their ordinary and generally accepted meaning, reading them in\n\ncontext and in light of the rules of grammar and common usage. See id.; Forbau v.\n\nAetna Life Ins. Co., 876 S.W.2d 132, 133 (Tex. 1994).\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      2.     Prevailing Parties\n\n      When interpreting a contractual attorney’s fee provision in which the\n\n“prevailing party” term is left undefined, as is the case here, we are to “presume the\n\nparties intended the terms ordinary meaning.” KB Home, 295 S.W.3d at 653.\n\n      A prevailing party is the party “who successfully prosecutes the action or\n\nsuccessfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the\n\nextent of its original contention.” Johns v. Ram-Forwarding, Inc., 29 S.W.3d 635,\n\n637–38 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.) (citing City of Amarillo v.\n\nGlick, 991 S.W.2d 14, 17 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1997, pet. denied)). Determination\n\nof whether a party is the prevailing or successful party is based upon success on the\n\nmerits, and not on whether damages were awarded. Glick, 991 S.W.2d at 17; see\n\nalso Robbins v. Capozzi, 100 S.W.3d 18, 27 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2002, no pet.). In\n\nother words, the prevailing party is the party who is vindicated by the trial court’s\n\njudgment. Glick, 991 S.W.2d at 17.\n\n      In its 2009 opinion in KB Home, the Texas Supreme Court explained that “[t]o\n\nqualify as a prevailing party, a . . . plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on the\n\nmerits of his claim. The plaintiff must obtain an enforceable judgment against the\n\ndefendant from whom fees are sought, or comparable relief through a consent decree\n\nor settlement.” 295 S.W.3d at 654. In short, “[w]hether a party prevails turns on\n\nwhether the party prevails upon the court to award it something, either monetary or\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fequitable.” Id. at 655. Although the opinion is instructive with regard to when a\n\nplaintiff can be a prevailing party, KB Home did not reach the issue of “whether the\n\ndefendant in that case could instead be the ‘prevailing party.’” Silver Lion, Inc. v.\n\nDolphin St., Inc., No. 01–07–00370–CV, 2010 WL 2025749, at *18 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] May 20, 2010, pet. denied) (mem. op.); see also Fitzgerald v.\n\nSchroeder Ventures II, LLC, 345 S.W.3d 624, 629–30 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\n2011, no pet.) (relying on Silver Lion and holding KB Home was inapplicable to\n\nquestion of whether defendant was entitled to attorney’s fees).\n\n      Two years after the KB Home opinion, the Texas Supreme Court revisited the\n\nquestion of what it means to be a “prevailing party” and clarified that a defendant\n\ndoes not have to obtain affirmative relief from a court in order to “prevail.” Epps,\n\n351 S.W.3d at 868–70. In Epps, the plaintiff nonsuited its case with prejudice. Id.\n\nThe Court held that a defendant is a prevailing party under such circumstances\n\nbecause “[t]he res judicata effect of a nonsuit with prejudice works a permanent,\n\ninalterable change in the parties’ legal relationship to the defendant’s benefit: the\n\ndefendant can never again be sued by the plaintiff or its privies for claims arising out\n\nof the same subject matter.” Id. at 868–69. Thus, a defendant who successfully\n\ndefends against a plaintiff’s claim is entitled to recover its attorney’s fees pursuant\n\nto a contract’s “prevailing party” clause. See SEECO, Inc. v. K. T. Rock, LLC, 416\n\nS.W.3d 664, 674 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. denied) (awarding\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fdefendant its attorney’s fees under “prevailing party” clause); see also Bhatia v.\n\nWoodlands N. Hous. Heart Ctr., PLLC, 396 S.W.3d 658, 670–71 (Tex. App.—[14th\n\nDist.] 2013, pet. denied) (same); Johnson v. Smith, No. 07–10–00017–CV, 2012 WL\n\n140654, at *2 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Jan. 18, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.) (same);\n\nSilver Lion, Inc., 2010 WL 2025749, at *18 (same).\n\n      3.     “Main Issue” Analysis\n\n      Drummond contends that he is the “prevailing party” under the Agreement\n\nbecause he prevailed at trial by successfully defending against the “main issue” in\n\nthe case, i.e., Urban’s breach of contract claim. Urban argues that KB Home\n\nspecifically rejected “main issue” analysis in cases involving contractual attorney’s\n\nfees provisions, and therefore, we should determine which party prevailed under the\n\nAgreement by looking at which party prevailed at any stage of the proceedings on\n\nthe most claims, counterclaims, and affirmative defenses, as opposed to only looking\n\nat which party prevailed at trial on the main issue.\n\n      KB Home did not reject “main issue” analysis in all circumstances. Although\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court rejected the dissent’s reliance upon “main issue” analysis\n\nin that case, it did so based on a conflict between the express language of the\n\ncontrolling attorney’s fee provision and the dissent’s analysis, which concluded that\n\nthe “main issue” in that breach of a contract case was a counterclaim based on a\n\nseparate oral agreement. KB Home, 295 S.W.3d at 661. Relying upon the express\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\flanguage of the contract’s attorney’s fees provision, the KB Home majority held that\n\nwhether a party was a prevailing party under the contract was confined to disputes\n\narising out of that written contract, and did not include disputes over oral side\n\nagreements.4 Id. Therefore, we do not read KB Home as rejecting “main issue”\n\nanalysis in all cases in which a contractual attorney’s fee provision controls, but,\n\nrather, only in those cases in which such analysis is incompatible with a controlling\n\ncontractual provision. See generally Bhatia, 396 S.W.3d at 670–71.\n\n      In the years since KB Home was decided, this Court and others have continued\n\nto use “main issue” analysis in cases involving contractual attorney’s fees\n\nprovisions. See Silver Lion, Inc., 2010 WL 2025749, at *18 (relying upon pre-KB\n\nHome authorities and holding defendant who prevailed on “main issue” was entitled\n\nto attorney’s fees pursuant to contract provision); see also SEECO, Inc., 416 S.W.3d\n\nat 674 (holding defendant who prevailed on “main issue” was entitled to attorney’s\n\nfees pursuant to contract provision); Bhatia, 396 S.W.3d at 670–71 (same); Johnson,\n\n\n\n4\n      Specifically, the majority stated:\n         The attorney’s-fees provision makes clear that the prevailing party is judged\n         by “an action to enforce the terms of this Contract or to declare rights\n         hereunder.” The problem with the dissent’s analysis is that Intercontinental’s\n         counterclaim was not rooted in the parties’ written contract, but rather in an\n         alleged separate oral agreement. Under the dissent’s “main issue” test, the\n         interpretation of “prevailing party” in “this Contract” is controlled by the fate\n         of a claim brought under a separate oral contract.\n      Intercontinental Grp. P’ship v. KB Home Lone Star L.P., 295 S.W.3d 650, 661 (Tex.\n      2009) (emphasis in original).\n\n                                            13\n\f2012 WL 140654, at *2 (same). In a case tried to a jury, the issues that are fully\n\nlitigated and properly submitted to the jury provide compelling evidence of the main\n\nissues in that case. See Bhatia, 396 S.W.3d at 670–71 (holding that, in suit involving\n\nmultiple claims and counterclaims based on breach of contract, tort, and statutory\n\ncauses of action, some of which “were essentially abandoned, and others were\n\ndefeated in motions practice and were not submitted to the jury or raised in th[e]\n\nappeal,” main issues were those that were fully litigated, properly submitted to jury,\n\nand formed basis of “vast majority of the [trial] testimony”); see generally Johnson,\n\nNo. 07–10–00017–CV, 2012 WL 140654, at *3 (stating that parties who “obtained\n\nfavorable findings on all major jury issues” and take-nothing judgment in their favor\n\nwere prevailing parties under contract).\n\n      Unlike Bhatia, the Court cannot review a full transcript of the trial\n\nproceedings in this case order to determine which issue or issues were the primary\n\nfocus of the testimony because the parties have only presented a partial reporter’s\n\nrecord on appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 34.6(c) (allowing for filing of partial reporter’s\n\nrecord). Unfortunately, only a fraction of the reporter’s record on file with this court\n\nincludes testimony on the merits. Most of the nine-volume reporter’s record consists\n\nof transcripts of bench and pretrial conferences held outside the jury’s presence, a\n\nbill of exception, a hearing on post-trial motions, and exhibits. Furthermore, half of\n\nthe testimony included in the partial record relates primarily to the issue of attorney’s\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\ffees, and, to a lesser degree, Urban’s amended motion for sanctions. As a result, we\n\ncannot discern which issue or issues consumed the majority of the trial testimony in\n\nthis case. Because Urban filed a statement of the points or issues to be presented on\n\nappeal in compliance with Rule 34.6(c), we “must presume that the partial reporter’s\n\nrecord designated by the parties constitutes the entire record for purposes of\n\nreviewing the stated points or issues.” TEX. R. APP. P. 34.6(c)(4).\n\nB.    Analysis\n\n      The only issues in this case that were submitted to the jury after a full trial on\n\nthe merits were Urban’s breach of contract claim and Drummond’s affirmative\n\ndefenses to that claim based on Urban’s alleged breach of its fiduciary duty and\n\nUrban’s prior breach of the Agreement. Although there were other issues raised in\n\nthis case, those claims, counterclaims, and affirmative defenses were either\n\neliminated in pretrial motion practice or not submitted to the jury. Thus, the appellate\n\nrecord reflects that Urban’s breach of contract claim was the main issue in this case.\n\nSee Bhatia, 396 S.W.3d at 670–71.\n\n      The jury found that both Urban and Drummond failed to comply with the\n\nAgreement, but Urban failed to materially comply with the Agreement first, and\n\nUrban’s failure to comply was not excused. The jury also found that Urban did not\n\ncomply with its fiduciary duty to Drummond after Drummond signed the\n\nAgreement. The jury awarded zero damages to Urban for Drummond’s breach of\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fcontract and the final judgment ordered that Urban take nothing on its claims against\n\nDrummond. Urban is not challenging the jury’s findings on appeal. Based on the\n\njury’s findings, Drummond’s failure to comply with the Agreement was excused as\n\na matter of law by Urban’s prior material breach. See Mustang Pipeline Co. v. Driver\n\nPipeline Co., 134 S.W.3d 195, 196 (Tex. 2004) (“It is a fundamental principle of\n\ncontract law that when one party to a contract commits a material breach of that\n\ncontract, the other party is discharged or excused from further performance.”).\n\nAccordingly, we hold that Drummond prevailed at trial by successfully defending\n\nagainst the main issue in this case, i.e., Urban’s breach of contract claim. See Bhatia,\n\n396 S.W.3d at 670–71; see also Johnson, 2012 WL 140654, at *3 (stating that parties\n\nwho “obtained favorable findings on all major jury issues” and take-nothing\n\njudgment in their favor were prevailing parties under contract). As the “prevailing\n\nparty” at trial on the main issue in this case, Drummond was entitled to recover his\n\ncosts and reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to the express language of the\n\nAgreement.\n\n      Urban argues that Drummond is not entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to KB\n\nHome because Drummond did not recover any affirmative relief on his\n\n“counterclaim” against Urban for breach of contract. See KB Home, 295 S.W.3d at\n\n654–55 (stating plaintiff must obtain some affirmative relief on his claim in order to\n\nbe prevailing party). However, Drummond asserted an affirmative defense, not a\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fcounterclaim for breach of contract, therefore, KB Home does not prohibit him from\n\nbeing a prevailing party under the Agreement. See Fitzgerald, 345 S.W.3d at 629–\n\n30 (noting that KB Home did not reach issue of whether defendant can be prevailing\n\nparty); Silver Lion, Inc., 2010 WL 2025749, at *18 (same).\n\n      Urban also argues that even if Drummond is a “prevailing party,” Drummond\n\nstill cannot recover his attorney’s fees because Urban “prevailed” on most of the\n\nclaims and affirmative defenses raised in this case, and therefore, Urban cannot be\n\nconsidered a “non-prevailing party” under the contract. As previously discussed,\n\nregardless of whether Urban successfully defended against other issues raised in this\n\ncase, particularly in motion practice, a “prevailing party” is one that succeeds on the\n\nmain issue. See SEECO, 416 S.W.3d at 674; see also Mag Instrument, Inc. v. G.T.\n\nSales Inc., 294 S.W.3d 800, 808 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, pet. denied)\n\n(“[T]he prevailing party is typically the party who either successfully prosecutes the\n\naction or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue.”); cf. Chevron\n\nPhillips Chem. Co., L.P. v. Kingwood Crossroads, L.P., 346 S.W.3d 37, 72 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. denied) (rejecting party’s argument that it\n\ncould not be considered “non-prevailing party” because jury found it “utterly\n\nblameless” with regard to failed transaction; stating that “[n]onetheless, the contract\n\nentitled a party to recover attorney’s fees for successful defense of a claim”). The\n\ntrial court rendered a take-nothing judgment in Drummond’s favor with respect to\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\fthe main issue in this case, Urban’s breach of contract claim, and Urban is not\n\nchallenging that aspect of the trial court’s judgment on appeal.\n\n      Urban also argues that Drummond cannot recover attorney’s fees based on his\n\ndefense of Urban’s breach of contract claim because the jury found that Drummond\n\nbreached the Agreement and there is no jury finding that Drummond’s breach was\n\nexcused. As previously discussed, the jury’s findings—which are not being\n\nchallenged on appeal—demonstrate that Drummond’s failure to comply with the\n\nAgreement was excused as a matter of law by Urban’s prior material breach. See\n\nMustang Pipeline Co., 134 S.W.3d at 196. Because Drummond’s breach was\n\nexcused as a matter of law, no jury finding on this issue was necessary. The jury’s\n\nfinding of breach in this context also does not prevent Drummond from recovering\n\nhis costs and attorney’s fees under the Agreement’s prevailing party provision. See\n\nChevron Phillips Chem. Co., 346 S.W.3d at 71–72 (affirming award of contractual\n\nattorney’s fees to party jury had found failed to comply with contract; party’s failure\n\nto comply was excused by impracticability).\n\n      Urban also cites to several cases for the general proposition that contracting\n\nparties cannot take advantage of favorable provisions of a contract they breached.\n\nAll of these cases, however, are distinguishable because none of them involve a\n\nbreaching party’s attempt to enforce a contractual attorney’s fees provision when\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fthat party’s breach was excused.5\n\n      Urban’s reliance upon dicta in KB Home and on another distinguishable case\n\nis similarly misplaced.6 After acknowledging that “[t]he issue of whether a\n\nbreaching-but-nonpaying defendant can be a ‘prevailing party’ under an\n\nattorney’s-fees provision” was not before the court, the KB Home court stated in a\n\nfootnote that “[w]hen defining litigation success, some might argue that while relief\n\nis required for plaintiffs to prevail, a finding of ‘no breach’ is required for\n\ndefendants—that is, a desired finding on breach is insufficient for plaintiffs but\n\nindispensable for defendants.” KB Home, 295 S.W.3d at 659 n.42. Urban argues that\n\nthis language indicates that Drummond cannot be a “prevailing party” under the\n\n5\n      See generally Drury Sw., Inc. v.

(jury found that both parties\n      materially breached contract, but GTP breached first; court held that GTP was not\n      entitled to damages on claim because “prior material breach was not the only\n      possible ground for the jury to find Frankel’s material breach was excused,” and\n      GTP was not challenging all possible grounds on appeal).\n\n\n                                           19\n\fAgreement. KB Home’s dicta, however, does not express any opinion about the\n\nsituation presented here—whether a defendant whose breach of the contract was\n\nexcused by the plaintiff’s prior material breach, can nevertheless be a “prevailing\n\nparty.”\n\n      Urban further contends that Drummond cannot recover attorney’s fees from\n\nUrban because Drummond has no obligation to pay such fees under Drummond’s\n\ncontingent fee agreement with this counsel. Regardless of the terms of Drummond’s\n\nfee arrangement, the Agreement at issue in this case expressly entitles a “prevailing\n\nparty in any legal proceeding brought as a result of a dispute under this agreement\n\nor any transaction related to this agreement . . . to recover from the non-prevailing\n\nparty all costs of such proceeding and reasonable attorney’s fees.” The only\n\nlimitations imposed by the Agreement on the award of attorney’s fees are that such\n\nfees must be reasonable and relate to an applicable legal proceeding. We will not\n\nrewrite the parties’ agreement or add any new requirements. See Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins.\n\nCo. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154, 162 (Tex. 2003) (a court “may neither rewrite the\n\nparties’ contract nor add to its language”); Nat. Gas Clearinghouse v. Midgard\n\nEnergy Co., 113 S.W.3d 400, 407 (Tex.

Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n      The need to segregate attorney’s fees is a question of law, but the extent to\n\nwhich certain claims can or cannot be segregated is a mixed question of law and fact.\n\nSee Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 312–13 (Tex. 2006).\n\n\n7\n      In light of our disposition, we need not address Urban’s third and fifth issues\n      challenging the trial court’s failure to award Urban its trial and appellate attorney’s\n      fees pursuant to the Agreement’s “prevailing party” clause.\n\n\n                                            21\n\fGenerally, a party seeking attorney’s fees must segregate fees between claims for\n\nwhich they are recoverable and claims for which they are not. Id. at 311. If the fee\n\nmovant survives the segregation inquiry, the reviewing court can then turn its\n\nattention to the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence underpinning the award.\n\nSee id. at 314.\n\n      When construing a contract, our primary concern is to ascertain the intentions\n\nof the parties as expressed in the document. Amedisys, Inc. v. Kingwood Home\n\nHealth Care, LLC, 437 S.W.3d 507, 514 (Tex. 2014). We begin our analysis with\n\nthe language of the contract because it is the best representation of what the parties\n\nmutually intended. Gilbert Tex. Constr., 327 S.W.3d at 126. Unless the contract\n\ndictates otherwise, we give words and phrases their ordinary and generally accepted\n\nmeaning, reading them in context and in light of the rules of grammar and common\n\nusage. See id.; Forbau, 876 S.W.2d at 133.\n\nB.    Analysis\n\n      Here, the Agreement does not expressly limit the availability of attorney’s\n\nfees to a party who prevails on any particular type of claim, but rather allows the\n\n“prevailing party in any legal proceeding brought as a result of a dispute under this\n\nagreement or any transaction related to this agreement . . . to recover from the\n\nnon-prevailing party all costs of such proceeding and reasonable attorney’s fees.”\n\nBecause the term “legal proceeding” is not defined in the Agreement, we interpret\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fthis phrase according to its ordinary and generally accepted meaning. See Gilbert\n\nTex. Constr., 327 S.W.3d at 126; Forbau, 876 S.W.2d at 133. Black’s Law\n\nDictionary defines “legal proceeding” as: “Any proceeding authorized by law and\n\ninstituted in a court or tribunal to acquire a right or to enforce a remedy.” BLACK’S\n\nLAW DICTIONARY 370 (Pocket ed. 1996). The term “legal proceeding,” as used in\n\nthe “prevailing party” provision of a real estate contract includes, at the very least, a\n\n“lawsuit.” Sierra Assoc. Grp., Inc. v. Hardeman, No. 03-08-00324-CV, 2009 WL\n\n416465, at *8–9 (Tex. App.—Austin Feb. 20, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.) (“Sierra\n\nfiled a lawsuit, which is, of course, a legal proceeding.”).\n\n      Urban initially sued Drummond for breach of contract in order to collect an\n\nunpaid commission under the Agreement. This suit is undoubtedly a “legal\n\nproceeding brought as a result of a dispute under” the Agreement. Drummond’s\n\ncounterclaims against Urban and Urban’s subsequently added fraud claim against\n\nDrummond are also part of the same “legal proceeding,” as that term is used in the\n\nAgreement.\n\n      Drummond argues that his third-party petitions against Di Ferrante, Silaski,\n\nand Ramani are also part of the same “legal proceeding” with Urban, and therefore,\n\nhe is entitled to recover any costs and attorney’s fees incurred with respect to these\n\nclaims. Although Drummond’s actions against Di Ferrante, Silaski, and Ramani\n\nwere included in the same trial court cause number as the action between Drummond\n\n\n\n                                           23\n\fand Urban, the contract only authorizes an award of fees against “the non-prevailing\n\nparty,” and Urban is not the non-prevailing party with respect to Drummond’s third-\n\nparty petitions against Di Ferrante, Silaski, and Ramani. As a result, Drummond\n\ncannot recover attorney’s fees and costs against Urban as a “prevailing party” with\n\nrespect to such claims. Cf. Garrison v. Kocurek, No. 03-99-00270-CV, 2000 WL\n\n45643, at *2 (Tex. App.—Austin Jan. 21, 2000, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated\n\nfor publication) (stating that main action should be viewed separately when\n\nevaluating who is “prevailing party” in third-party action). Therefore, Drummond\n\nwas required to segregate his fees with respect to the time his attorney spent on his\n\nthird-party petitions against Di Ferrante, Silaski, and Ramani. See Tony Gullo, 212\n\nS.W.3d at 311.\n\n      Accordingly, we sustain Urban’s second issue and we remand the case for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion on the issue of Drummond’s\n\nattorney’s fees.\n\n            Statutory Attorney’s Fees and Attorney’s Fees as Sanctions\n\n      In its fourth issue, Urban argues that the trial court erred by denying Urban’s\n\namended motion for sanctions which sought mandatory statutory attorney’s fees\n\nunder the DTPA and TDCA, and attorney’s fees as sanctions under Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure 13 and 215 and Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapters\n\n9 and 10.\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fA.    Urban’s Claims for Attorney’s Fees pursuant to DTPA and TDCA\n\n      1.     Standard of Review\n\n      The availability of attorney’s fees under the DTPA or TDCA is a question of\n\nlaw that we review de novo. See Holland v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1 S.W.3d 91, 94\n\n(Tex. 1999); see also Johnson v. City of Fort Worth, 774 S.W.2d 653, 656 (Tex.\n\n1989) (“Matters of statutory construction are questions of law for the court to\n\ndecide.”). However, if attorney’s fees are available pursuant to a given statute, we\n\nreview a trial court’s refusal to award such fees for an abuse of discretion. See\n\nDonwerth v. Preston II Chrysler–Dodge, Inc., 775 S.W.2d 634, 637 n.3 (Tex. 1989);\n\nBohls v. Oakes, 75 S.W.3d 473, 480 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, pet. denied).\n\n      2.     Texas Debt Collection Act\n\n      Urban’s amended motion asked the trial court to award it its attorney’s fees\n\nand costs pursuant to the TDCA and DTPA. Both statutes have similar provisions\n\nauthorizing the trial court to award a defendant reasonable attorney’s fees and costs\n\nif the court finds that an action under that section: (1) “was brought in bad faith or\n\nfor purposes of harassment,” TEX. FIN. CODE ANN. § 392.403(c) (West 2006); and\n\n(2) “was groundless in fact or law or brought in bad faith, or brought for the purpose\n\nof harassment.” TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 17.50(c) (West 2011).\n\n      Although Urban pleaded for attorney’s fees pursuant to the Agreement and\n\nDTPA section 17.50(c), it did not request attorney’s fees under TDCA section\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f392.403(c) until its post-trial amended motion for sanctions. See Heritage Gulf\n\nCoast Props., Ltd. v. Sandalwood Apartments, Inc., 416 S.W.3d 642, 663 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (holding that trial court did not err by\n\nrefusing to award party attorney’s fees on unpleaded ground). Accordingly, we hold\n\nthat the trial court did not err in refusing to award Urban its attorney’s fees under\n\nTDCA section 392.403(c) because Urban did not timely plead for such relief. Id.;\n\nsee also TEX. R. CIV. P. 63 (stating party may amend its pleadings until seven days\n\nbefore trial unless amended pleadings operate as surprise to opposing party).\n\n      3.     Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act\n\n      The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Urban on Drummond’s\n\nDTPA counterclaim. Urban contends that it is entitled to attorney’s fees under\n\nsection 17.50(c) because Drummond’s DTPA claim is groundless.8\n\n      The DTPA authorizes a trial court to award a defendant its reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees and court costs if the court finds that “an action under this\n\nsection was groundless in fact or law or brought in bad faith, or brought for the\n\npurpose of harassment.” TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 17.50(c) (West 2011). The\n\nterm “groundless” as used in the DPTA has the same meaning as it does under Rule\n\n13, i.e., “no basis in law or fact and not warranted by good faith argument for the\n\n\n\n8\n      Urban does not argue on appeal that Drummond’s DTPA claim was brought in bad\n      faith or for purposes of harassment.\n\n\n                                          26\n\fextension, modification, or reversal of existing law.” Donwerth, 775 S.W.2d at 637;\n\nsee also Mosk v. Thomas, 183 S.W.3d 691, 695 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2003, no pet.). In order to determine whether a DTPA claim is groundless, a trial\n\ncourt must examine the facts available to the litigant and circumstances existing\n\nwhen the litigant filed his or her pleadings. Davila v. World Car Five Star, 75 S.W.3d\n\n537, 542–43 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, no pet.) (applying case law interpreting\n\nRule 13 to motion for attorney’s fees under DTPA). The standard for determining\n\nwhether a suit is groundless considers “whether the totality of the tendered evidence\n\ndemonstrates an arguable basis in fact and law for the consumer’s claim.”\n\nSplettstosser v. Myer, 779 S.W.2d 806, 808 (Tex. 1989). Groundlessness is more\n\nthan an ultimate determination that the claim is not a winner. See Emmons v. Purser,\n\n973 S.W.2d 696, 700 (Tex. App.—Austin 1998, no pet.) (Rule 13).\n\n      Questions of whether an action is groundless, brought in bad faith, or brought\n\nfor the purpose of harassment are reserved solely for the court, according to the plain\n\nwords of the statute. See Donwerth, 775 S.W.2d at 637. Appellate review of such\n\ndeterminations is a question of law under an abuse of discretion standard. Id. at 637\n\nn.3. A trial court abuses its discretion if the trial court acts without reference to\n\nguiding rules and principles, or acts arbitrarily or unreasonably. Downer v.\n\nAquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241–42 (Tex. 1985).\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f      In its amended motion for sanctions, Urban argued that Drummond’s DTPA\n\nclaim was groundless and brought in bad faith and for purpose of harassment, and\n\nasked the court to take judicial notice of Drummond’s counterclaims, Urban’s\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment, Urban’s reply to Drummond’s response to\n\nUrban’s motion, and the court’s order granting Urban’s motion. Later in its amended\n\nmotion for sanctions, Urban argued that “[m]ost of the allegations supporting\n\nDrummond’s” DTPA claim “were contradicted by Drummond’s own testifying\n\nexpert, George Stephens in his deposition,” and that “Drummond and his counsel\n\nfailed to explore and verify any basis for [his] allegations [regarding the validity and\n\nenforceability of the Agreement] from those experts in Texas real estate rules,\n\nregulations, and practices.” Urban did not otherwise specify in its motion why it\n\nbelieved that Drummond’s claim was groundless, brought in bad faith, and for\n\npurpose of harassment.\n\n      Drummond responded to the amended motion, attaching an affidavit from his\n\ncounsel. In that affidavit Drummond’s counsel testified that he had made a\n\nreasonable inquiry into the legal and factual basis for the DTPA claim and that the\n\nclaim was not brought in bad faith or for purpose of harassment. An evidentiary\n\nhearing was not held on Urban’s motion for sanctions. The trial court denied Urban’s\n\nmotion and stated: “After reviewing the motion and response, as well as the evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                          28\n\fin the record and the pleadings on file, the Court is of the opinion that the Motion\n\nshould be denied.”\n\n      The pleadings and motions Urban relied on in its sanctions motion do little to\n\nilluminate the facts available to Drummond’s attorney and the circumstances that\n\nexisted when he signed and filed the various pleadings asserting a counterclaim\n\nunder the DTPA. See Davila, 75 S.W.3d at 542–43 (stating court must examine facts\n\navailable to litigant and circumstances existing when litigant filed his pleading when\n\ndetermining whether DTPA claim is groundless). Drummond’s counsel, however,\n\ntestified that he reviewed the DTPA and “select[ed] those possible claims that could\n\nbe warranted by the facts as [he] then understood them or as [he] reasonably\n\nexpected them to ultimately be after discovery.” Thus, there is some evidence from\n\nwhich the trial court could have determined that the DTPA claim was not groundless.\n\nSee Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co., 84 S.W.3d 198, 211 (Tex. 2002) (stating that trial\n\ncourt does not abuse its discretion so long as some evidence supports its decision).\n\nAccordingly, based on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion when it denied Urban’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs under the\n\nDTPA. See Donwerth, 775 S.W.2d at 637 n.3; Bohls, 75 S.W.3d at 480.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\fB.    Urban’s Claims for Attorney’s Fees as Sanctions under Rule 13 and\n      Chapters 9 and 10\n\n      1.     Chapter 9\n\n      Urban complains on appeal about the trial court’s failure to sanction\n\nDrummond pursuant to Chapter 9. Although Urban moved for sanctions pursuant to\n\nChapter 9 in a pre-trial motion, Urban did not mention Chapter 9 in its post-trial\n\nAmended Motion for Sanctions. Unlike a supplemental motion, an amended motion\n\nsupercedes the previous motion. See Dall. Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Finlan, 27 S.W.3d 220,\n\n231 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2000, pet. denied) (stating that amended summary judgment\n\nmotion supercedes and supplants previous motion, which may no longer be\n\nconsidered). A court is not authorized to grant sanctions under a statute or rule not\n\nidentified in the motion for sanctions. See Greene v. Young, 174 S.W.3d 291, 301\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (holding trial court erred in\n\nimposing sanctions on grounds that were not pleaded). The trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion by not awarding Urban sanctions pursuant to Chapter 9 because Urban\n\ndid not request sanctions on that basis in its amended motion. See Greene, 174\n\nS.W.3d at 301; Ball v. Rao, 48 S.W.3d 332, 338 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2001, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n      2.     Chapter 10 and Rule 13\n\n      On appeal, Urban argues that the trial court erred in denying its request for\n\nsanctions because: (1) Drummond filed groundless claims (i.e., DTPA, TDCA, all\n\n\n                                         30\n\fclaims against Di Ferrante, fraud, class relief, and anti-trust violations) and defenses\n\n(i.e., illegality, public policy, and failure to be a procuring cause) in bad faith and\n\nfor purpose of harassment; (2) Drummond’s response to Urban’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment included a verifiably false statement of fact regarding the\n\namount of attorney’s fees requested by Urban; (3) Drummond’s response to another\n\nof Urban’s motions for summary judgment included a “misleading statement” to the\n\ncourt about the definition of the term “procuring cause”; (4) Drummond abused the\n\ndiscovery process by refusing to appear for deposition and then refusing to answer\n\nquestions during his deposition; and (5) Drummond and his counsel “engaged in a\n\npattern of conduct” that includes the aforementioned instances of misconduct,\n\nresulting in “needless expense, delay and waste of judicial resources.”\n\n          a. Standard of Review\n\n      Our analysis of a motion for sanctions filed under Chapter 10 is the same as\n\nour review of a motion filed under Rule 13. See Nath v. Tex. Children’s Hosp., 446\n\nS.W.3d 355, 361 (Tex. 2014); Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex. 2007). We\n\nmay reverse the trial court’s ruling only if the trial court acted without reference to\n\nany guiding rules and principles, such that its ruling was arbitrary or unreasonable.\n\nLow, 221 S.W.3d at 614.\n\n      For the purposes of Chapter 10 and Rule 13, courts presume pleadings,\n\nmotions, and other papers are filed in good faith. Thottumkal v. McDougal, 251\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\fS.W.3d 715, 718 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied); Nath, 446\n\nS.W.3d at 361. The party moving for sanctions bears the burden of overcoming this\n\npresumption. Nath, 446 S.W.3d at 361; Low, 221 S.W.3d at 614.\n\n          b. Rule 139\n\n      Rule 13 authorizes the imposition of sanctions if an attorney or party signs a\n\npleading, motion, or other paper that is (1) groundless and (2) brought in bad faith\n\nor for the purpose of harassment. TEX. R. CIV. P. 13. For the purpose of Rule 13,\n\n“groundless” means that the claim has “no basis in law or fact and not warranted by\n\ngood faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.” Id.;\n\nR.M. Dudley Constr. Co. v. Dawson, 258 S.W.3d 694, 708 (Tex. App.—Waco 2008,\n\npet. denied). To determine if a claim is groundless, the trial court must objectively\n\nask whether the party and counsel made a reasonable inquiry into the legal and\n\nfactual basis of the claim at the time the document in question was filed. See Loeffler\n\nv. Lytle Indep. Sch. Dist., 211 S.W.3d 331, 348 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2006, pet.\n\ndenied). We determine whether a reasonable inquiry has been made by looking at\n\nthe facts available to the attorney and the circumstances that existed when the\n\nattorney signed and filed the document in question. See Robson v. Gilbreath, 267\n\n\n\n\n9\n      Rule 13 authorizes sanctions as are available under Rule 215.2(b), which includes\n      attorney’s fees.\n\n\n                                          32\n\fS.W.3d 401, 405 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, pet. denied); Elkins v. Stotts–Brown,\n\n103 S.W.3d 664, 668 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, no pet.).\n\n      Bad faith is the conscious doing of a wrong for dishonest, discriminatory, or\n\nmalicious purposes; bad faith does not exist when a party merely exercises bad\n\njudgment or is negligent. Thielemann v. Kethan, 371 S.W.3d 286, 294 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. denied) (citing Elkins, 103 S.W.3d at 669)). A\n\ndocument is filed for the purpose of harassment if it is filed with the intent to annoy,\n\nalarm, and abuse another person. See Thielemann, 371 S.W.3d at 294 (citing Elkins,\n\n103 S.W.3d at 669). In deciding whether a party filed a document in bad faith or for\n\nthe purpose of harassment, the trial court must measure the party’s conduct and\n\nexamine the facts available to the party at the time the relevant document was signed.\n\nSee Gomer v. Davis, 419 S.W.3d 470, 478, 480 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2013, no pet.). Thus, the court must consider the acts or omissions of counsel, not\n\nmerely the legal merit of a pleading or motion. See id.; see also Parker v. Walton,\n\n233 S.W.3d 535, 539 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.).\n\n      Rule 13 generally requires that the trial court hold an evidentiary hearing to\n\nmake a determination about the motives and credibility of the person signing the\n\ndocument. Gomer, 419 S.W.3d at 480. In some circumstances, however, the trial\n\ncourt may be able to make a determination by taking judicial notice of items in the\n\ncase file. The trial court abuses its discretion in imposing sanctions under Rule 13 if\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\fthere is no evidence in the record for the court to determine that the party signed and\n\nfiled the document in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. See id.\n\n          c. Chapter 10\n\n      Chapter 10 provides that the signature of attorneys or parties on a pleading or\n\nmotion constitutes a certificate by them that, to the best of their knowledge,\n\ninformation, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry, the instrument is not being\n\npresented for an improper purpose, is warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous\n\nargument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the\n\nestablishment of new law, and there is evidentiary support for each allegation or\n\ncontention. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 10.001 (West 2002). “A court that\n\ndetermines that a person has signed a pleading or motion in violation of Section\n\n10.001 may impose a sanction on the person, a party represented by the person, or\n\nboth.” Id. § 10.004. As with Rule 13, in order to impose sanctions under Chapter 10,\n\nthe trial court in most cases must hold an evidentiary hearing in order to make the\n\nnecessary factual determinations about the party’s or the attorney’s motives and\n\ncredibility. See Dawson, 258 S.W.3d at 709; Gomer, 419 S.W.3d at 480. The party\n\nmoving for sanctions must prove the pleading party’s subjective state of mind.\n\nWithout an evidentiary hearing, the court may lack evidence to determine whether a\n\npleading or motion was filed in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. Dawson,\n\n258 S.W.3d at 710; Gomer, 419 S.W.3d at 480.\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\f         d. Analysis\n\n           i.   False or Misleading Statements in Pretrial Responses to Motion\n                for Summary Judgment\n      Urban moved for sanctions against Drummond based on the fact that\n\nDrummond’s counsel signed: (1) the October 2012 response to Urban’s partial\n\nmotion for summary judgment which included a “misleading statement” about the\n\ndefinition of the term “procuring cause”; and (2) the October 2013 response to\n\nUrban’s motion for summary judgment on Drummond’s TDCA claims which falsely\n\nstated that Urban was seeking $128,571.72 in attorney’s fees.\n\n      “Sanctions for alleged violations known to movants before trial are waived if\n\na hearing and ruling are not secured pretrial.” Finlay v. Olive, 77 S.W.3d 520, 525\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (holding party waived its right to\n\nsanctions pursuant to Chapter 10 and Rule 215 by failing to request and obtain\n\nhearing on sanctions motion for matters known to party prior to trial). In this case,\n\nUrban did not request sanctions based on these allegedly false and misleading\n\nstatements until after trial. Moreover, Urban’s amended motion reflects that its\n\nrequest for sanctions is based entirely upon pre-trial events that, in one case, were\n\nknown to Urban well in advance of trial (i.e., Drummond’s October 2012 response).\n\nAs was the case in Finlay, “the pre-trial conduct matters at issue . . . were all\n\ncomplete before trial; no trial testimony was needed to determine whether improper\n\nconduct known before trial warranted sanctions.” Id. at 526. Urban argues that its\n\n\n                                         35\n\famended motion is timely because the trial court has plenary power to grant a\n\nsanctions motion filed after a final judgment has been rendered for filing groundless\n\npleadings pursuant to Rule 13 and Chapter 10. See Lane Bank Equip. Co. v. Smith\n\nSo. Equip., Inc., 10 S.W.3d 308, 312 (Tex. 2000). However, Urban waived its right\n\nto sanctions based on Drummond’s allegedly false or misleading pretrial statements\n\nby failing to obtain a hearing and ruling on said motion prior to trial. See Finlay, 77\n\nS.W.3d at 526.\n\n           ii.   Drummond’s “Groundless” Claims and Defenses\n\n      On appeal, Urban argues that it is entitled to sanctions against Drummond\n\nbased on Drummond’s filing of groundless claims and defenses in bad faith and with\n\nintent to harass. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 13. At the outset, we note that Urban did not\n\nrequest sanctions based on Drummond’s claims for fraud and class relief in its\n\namended motion for sanctions. Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion when it refused to award Urban attorney’s fees based on Drummond’s\n\nfiling of these claims. See Ball, 48 S.W.3d at 338 (holding trial court erred in\n\nimposing sanctions when motion did not request sanctions on that ground).\n\n      With respect to Drummond’s other allegedly groundless claims and defenses,\n\nDrummond responded to the amended motion for sanctions, attaching an affidavit\n\nfrom his counsel in which he stated that he made what he considered to be a\n\nreasonable inquiry into the legal and factual basis of these claims when he filed the\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fpleading in question and responded to the various motions for summary judgment\n\non those claims. Drummond’s counsel also testified that he “unequivocally” denied\n\nfiling any of these claims or defenses for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith.\n\nThus, there is some evidence from which the trial court could have determined that\n\nthese claims and defenses were not groundless. Accordingly, based on the record\n\nbefore us, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied\n\nUrban’s motion for sanctions on this ground. See Donwerth, 775 S.W.2d at 637 n.3;\n\nBohls, 75 S.W.3d at 480.\n\n          iii.   Discovery Abuses\n\n      Urban also sought sanctions against Drummond for pretrial discovery abuses\n\nrelating to Drummond’s alleged refusal to appear for deposition and his refusal to\n\nanswer questions during his deposition. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 215.2(b)(2) (authorizing\n\ncourt to impose monetary penalty against party, or advising attorney, who fails to\n\ncomply with order compelling discovery or abuses discovery process). A party’s\n\nfailure to obtain a pretrial ruling on discovery disputes existing before trial begins\n\nconstitutes a waiver of the issue on appeal. See Remington Arms Co., Inc. v.\n\nCaldwell, 850 S.W.2d 167, 170 (Tex. 1993); see also Finlay, 77 S.W.3d at 525.\n\nAlthough Urban filed motions to compel Drummond’s deposition testimony, the\n\nappellate record does not reflect that Urban ever obtained a ruling on its motions.\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\fAccordingly, Urban has waived any claim for sanctions based on these pretrial\n\ndiscovery abuses. Id.\n\n          iv.   “Pattern of Conduct”\n\n      Urban also argues on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion when it\n\nrefused to award it sanctions because Drummond and his counsel “engaged in a\n\npattern of conduct” that resulted in “needless expense, delay and waste of judicial\n\nresources.” Urban did not raise this argument in its amended motion for sanctions\n\nand Urban’s “pattern of conduct” argument is not an independent ground for the\n\nimposition of sanctions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not sanctioning\n\nDrummond and awarding Urban attorney’s fees on this basis.\n\nC.    Urban’s Claim for Mandatory Attorney’s Fees with Respect to\n      Drummond’s Third-Party Petitions\n\n      In addition to seeking recovery of the attorney’s fees Urban incurred\n\ndefending itself against Drummond’s counterclaims, Urban is also seeking\n\nattorney’s fees from Drummond based on Drummond’s filing of third-party\n\npetitions against Urban’s counsel (Di Ferrante), Urban’s president and CEO\n\n(Ramani), and an Urban employee (Silaski). Urban contends that Drummond’s third-\n\nparty DTPA and TDCA claims are groundless and have no basis in law or fact and\n\nseeks to recover the attorney’s fees Urban incurred defending Di Ferrante, Silaski,\n\nand Ramani against these claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f      Drummond nonsuited all of his claims against Di Ferrante, Silaski, and\n\nRamani without prejudice in October 2012. Urban and Drummond tried the\n\nremaining claims to a jury in November 2013. The record reflects that Urban did not\n\nattempt to recover attorney’s fees it incurred defending Di Ferrante, Silaski, and\n\nRamani against Drummond’s DTPA and TDCA claims pursuant to Chapter 10 and\n\nRule 13 until Urban’s post-trial amended motion for sanctions, which was filed in\n\nDecember 2013—14 months after the nonsuit.\n\n      As previously discussed, “[s]anctions for alleged violations known to movants\n\nbefore trial are waived if a hearing and ruling are not secured pretrial.” Finlay, 77\n\nS.W.3d at 525; see generally Remington Arms, 850 S.W.2d at 170 (holding that “the\n\nfailure to obtain a pretrial ruling on discovery disputes that exist before\n\ncommencement of trial constitutes a waiver of any claim for sanctions based on that\n\nconduct”). Urban did not request sanctions for these pretrial matters until after trial.\n\nAs was the case in Finlay, “the pre-trial conduct matters at issue . . . were all\n\ncomplete before trial; no trial testimony was needed to determine whether improper\n\nconduct known before trial warranted sanctions.” Finlay, 77 S.W.3d at 526.\n\n      Urban waived its right to sanctions based on Drummond’s filing of the\n\nthird-party complaints by failing to move for sanctions and request and obtain\n\nhearing on its sanctions motion for matters known to the party prior to trial. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\fD.    Conclusion\n\n      Having determined that Urban waived its right to sanctions or that the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by denying Urban’s amended motion for sanctions,\n\nwe overrule Urban’s fourth issue.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the portion of the trial court’s judgment awarding Drummond his\n\nattorney’s fees and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion on this issue. We affirm the trial court’s denial of Urban’s amended motion\n\nfor sanctions and affirm the judgment in all other respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Russell Lloyd\n                                              Justice\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Massengale, and Lloyd.\n\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\f",

(Urban) appeals a final judgment entered after a jury\n\ntrial in a suit it initiated against Chris Drummond in which no party received any\n\naward of damages, but in which Drummond was awarded attorney’s fees. In five\n\nissues, Urban contends that: (1) the trial court erroneously awarded attorney’s fees\n\nto Drummond and denied Urban’s motion to disregard the jury’s finding on\n\fattorney’s fees to Drummond, (2) alternatively, if Drummond was entitled to recover\n\nattorney’s fees, a remittitur is appropriate, because the amount of attorney’s fees\n\nawarded is excessive and the evidence was factually and legally insufficient to\n\nsupport it, (3) the trial court erred by refusing to award Urban its attorney’s fees in\n\nthe amount found by the jury, (4) the trial court erred by denying Urban’s amended\n\nmotion for sanctions which sought mandatory statutory attorney’s fees under the\n\nTexas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) and Texas Debt Collection Act\n\n(TDCA) and attorney’s fees as sanctions pursuant to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\n\n13 and 215 and Chapters 9 and 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nand (5) the trial court erred in refusing to award Urban its appellate attorney’s fees\n\nas a matter of law. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      Chris Drummond signed a Residential Buyer/Tenant Representation\n\nAgreement (the Agreement) in 2011 in which Drummond agreed to “work\n\nexclusively through [Urban] in acquiring property” in the Houston market area for a\n\nsix-month period. Under the terms of the Agreement, Urban was entitled to a\n\ncommission based on the gross sales price of the property Drummond agreed to\n\npurchase in the market area, and the commission became payable when the\n\ntransaction closed or when Drummond breached the Agreement, whichever occurred\n\nfirst. The Agreement further stated that in the event Drummond defaulted on the\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fAgreement, Drummond “will be liable for the amount of compensation that [Urban]\n\nwould have received under this agreement if [Urban] was not in default.” The\n\nAgreement also contained the following attorney’s fees provision:\n\n      ATTORNEY’S FEES: If Client or Broker is a prevailing party in any\n      legal proceeding brought as a result of a dispute under this agreement\n      or any transaction related to this agreement, such party will be entitled\n      to recover from the non-prevailing party all costs of such proceeding\n      and reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n      Drummond purchased a home in Houston through another realtor during\n\nUrban’s six-month exclusive period. Urban filed a breach of contract claim against\n\nDrummond to collect the commission and attorney’s fees as provided for in the\n\nAgreement. Drummond answered and asserted numerous affirmative defenses to\n\nUrban’s breach of contract claim, including breach of fiduciary duty, and ten\n\ncounterclaims against Urban, including a “counterclaim” for breach of the\n\nAgreement and a counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty based exclusively upon\n\nUrban’s conduct prior to execution of the Agreement. Drummond also filed\n\nthird-party claims against Urban’s counsel (Chris Di Ferrante), Urban’s President\n\nand CEO (Vinod Ramani), and an Urban employee (George Silaski). Urban later\n\nadded claims for fraud, and statutory attorney’s fees under section 17.50(c) of the\n\nDTPA and section 15.21 of the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act (TFEA).\n\n      Drummond nonsuited his third-party actions without prejudice and Urban\n\ndismissed its fraud claim against Drummond before trial. Urban also obtained\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fsummary judgment on several of Drummond’s counterclaims and affirmative\n\ndefenses prior to trial, and the trial court refused to submit jury questions on several\n\nothers.1 The only questions submitted to the jury pertained to Urban’s breach of\n\ncontract claim and Drummond’s affirmative defense of breach of fiduciary duty.2\n\nThe jury was asked: (1) whether Urban or Drummond failed to comply with the\n\nAgreement, (2) if both Urban and Drummond failed to comply, who failed to\n\nmaterially comply first, (3) if Urban failed to materially comply first, was Urban’s\n\nfailure to comply excused, and (4) what amount of damages, if any, Urban was\n\nentitled to as a result of Drummond’s failure to materially comply with the\n\nAgreement. The jury was also asked to decide whether Urban had breached its\n\nfiduciary duty to Drummond after Drummond executed the Agreement, and to\n\ndetermine a reasonable amount of attorney’s fees for both parties through trial and\n\n\n\n\n1\n      Although they were set forth in his live pleading at trial, several of Drummond’s\n      other counterclaims and affirmative defenses were never expressly disposed of by\n      the court (e.g., Drummond’s counterclaim for class relief).\n2\n      In his live pleading Drummond alleged: (1) breach of fiduciary duty as an\n      affirmative defense to Urban’s breach of contract claim; and (2) a counterclaim\n      against Urban for breach of fiduciary duty. Drummond’s counterclaim for breach of\n      fiduciary duty is based exclusively upon Urban’s actions prior to and\n      contemporaneous with the execution of the Agreement. The jury, however, was only\n      asked to determine if Urban complied with its fiduciary duties to Drummond after\n      Drummond executed the Agreement. Thus, the record reflects that the court’s\n      charge included a question on Drummond’s affirmative defense to Urban’s breach\n      of contract claim, not a question on Drummond’s breach of fiduciary duty claim, as\n      Urban argues on appeal.\n\n                                           4\n\fon appeal. No damages question was submitted to the jury with respect to\n\nDrummond.\n\n      The jury found that both Drummond and Urban failed to comply with the\n\nAgreement, Urban failed to materially comply first, Urban’s failure to materially\n\ncomply was not excused, and Urban did not comply with its fiduciary duty to\n\nDrummond. The jury found that Urban incurred zero damages. The jury also found\n\nthat a reasonable amount for Urban’s attorney’s fees was $74,649 through trial and\n\nzero on appeal, and that a reasonable amount for Drummond’s attorney’s fees was\n\n$110,000 through trial and $60,000 on appeal.\n\n      The trial court rendered a final judgment based on the jury verdict that ordered\n\nthat Urban take nothing on its claims against Drummond, and awarded Drummond\n\n$110,000 in attorney’s fees through trial, plus an additional $60,000 in conditional\n\nappellate attorney’s fees. The award of attorney’s fees was premised on the trial\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Drummond was the “prevailing party” under the Agreement\n\nand Urban was the “non-prevailing party.”\n\n      Urban filed a timely motion to disregard the jury’s findings and a motion for\n\nnew trial. Urban also filed a post-trial amended motion for sanctions which sought\n\nmandatory statutory attorney’s fees under the DTPA, the TFEA, the TDCA, and\n\nattorney’s fees as sanctions under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 13 and 215 and\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapters 9 and 10. The trial court denied\n\nall three motions.\n\n      This appeal followed.\n\n        Breach of Contract “Counterclaim” and Prior Material Breach\n\n      Urban raises arguments in its first appellate issue that are premised in part\n\nupon the following two assertions: (1) Drummond pleaded a “counterclaim” against\n\nUrban for breach of contract, and (2) the trial court granted summary judgment in\n\nUrban’s favor on Drummond’s affirmative defense of prior material breach.\n\nA.    Drummond’s Breach of Contract “Counterclaim”\n\n      Urban contends that Drummond pleaded a “counterclaim” against Urban for\n\nbreach of contract. Drummond responds that he only asserted an affirmative defense\n\nto Urban’s breach of contract claim, not a separate counterclaim.\n\n      The record reflects that Drummond pleaded what he denoted as a\n\n“counterclaim” for breach of contract in his live pleading, as well as an affirmative\n\ndefense to Urban’s breach of contract claim, both of which were premised on the\n\nsame reasoning, i.e., that Urban breached the Agreement by failing to use best efforts\n\nin representing Drummond after the Agreement was executed. Because Urban did\n\nnot challenge Drummond’s pleading by special exceptions, we must liberally\n\nconstrue the pleading in Drummond’s favor.

We liberally\n\nconstrue Drummond’s purported “counterclaim” for breach of contract as an\n\naffirmative defense to Urban’s breach of contract claim.\n\nB.    Prior Material Breach\n\n      Urban also contends that the trial court granted summary judgment in its favor\n\non Drummond’s affirmative defense of prior material breach, thus foreclosing\n\nDrummond from arguing that affirmative defense at trial. The record reflects,\n\nhowever, that the parties debated the scope of the summary judgment order during a\n\npretrial hearing and, at that hearing, the trial judge clarified her earlier summary\n\njudgment ruling and stated that “prior breach by Urban is still a viable affirmative\n\ndefense” for Drummond. Thus, Drummond’s affirmative defense that he was\n\nexcused from performance under the contract based on Urban’s prior material breach\n\nhad not been disposed of by the court by the time of trial.\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      Having resolved these preliminary matters, we will now address Urban’s\n\nappellate complaints.\n\n                Award of Attorney’s Fees Pursuant to Agreement\n\n      In its first issue, Urban contends that the trial court erred by awarding\n\nattorney’s fees to Drummond because Drummond is not a “prevailing party” under\n\nthe Agreement.3 Drummond requested an award of attorney’s fees based exclusively\n\nupon the Agreement’s attorney’s fee provision.

Urban argues that KB Home\n\nspecifically rejected “main issue” analysis in cases involving contractual attorney’s\n\nfees provisions, and therefore, we should determine which party prevailed under the\n\nAgreement by looking at which party prevailed at any stage of the proceedings on\n\nthe most claims, counterclaims, and affirmative defenses, as opposed to only looking\n\nat which party prevailed at trial on the main issue.\n\n      KB Home did not reject “main issue” analysis in all circumstances. Although\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court rejected the dissent’s reliance upon “main issue” analysis\n\nin that case, it did so based on a conflict between the express language of the\n\ncontrolling attorney’s fee provision and the dissent’s analysis, which concluded that\n\nthe “main issue” in that breach of a contract case was a counterclaim based on a\n\nseparate oral agreement. KB Home, 295 S.W.3d at 661. Relying upon the express\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\flanguage of the contract’s attorney’s fees provision, the KB Home majority held that\n\nwhether a party was a prevailing party under the contract was confined to disputes\n\narising out of that written contract, and did not include disputes over oral side\n\nagreements.4 Id. Therefore, we do not read KB Home as rejecting “main issue”\n\nanalysis in all cases in which a contractual attorney’s fee provision controls, but,\n\nrather, only in those cases in which such analysis is incompatible with a controlling\n\ncontractual provision. See generally Bhatia, 396 S.W.3d at 670–71.\n\n      In the years since KB Home was decided, this Court and others have continued\n\nto use “main issue” analysis in cases involving contractual attorney’s fees\n\nprovisions.

See TEX. R. APP. P. 34.6(c) (allowing for filing of partial reporter’s\n\nrecord). Unfortunately, only a fraction of the reporter’s record on file with this court\n\nincludes testimony on the merits. Most of the nine-volume reporter’s record consists\n\nof transcripts of bench and pretrial conferences held outside the jury’s presence, a\n\nbill of exception, a hearing on post-trial motions, and exhibits. Furthermore, half of\n\nthe testimony included in the partial record relates primarily to the issue of attorney’s\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\ffees, and, to a lesser degree, Urban’s amended motion for sanctions. As a result, we\n\ncannot discern which issue or issues consumed the majority of the trial testimony in\n\nthis case. Because Urban filed a statement of the points or issues to be presented on\n\nappeal in compliance with Rule 34.6(c), we “must presume that the partial reporter’s\n\nrecord designated by the parties constitutes the entire record for purposes of\n\nreviewing the stated points or issues.” TEX. R. APP. P. 34.6(c)(4).\n\nB.    Analysis\n\n      The only issues in this case that were submitted to the jury after a full trial on\n\nthe merits were Urban’s breach of contract claim and Drummond’s affirmative\n\ndefenses to that claim based on Urban’s alleged breach of its fiduciary duty and\n\nUrban’s prior breach of the Agreement. Although there were other issues raised in\n\nthis case, those claims, counterclaims, and affirmative defenses were either\n\neliminated in pretrial motion practice or not submitted to the jury. Thus, the appellate\n\nrecord reflects that Urban’s breach of contract claim was the main issue in this case.\n\nSee Bhatia, 396 S.W.3d at 670–71.\n\n      The jury found that both Urban and Drummond failed to comply with the\n\nAgreement, but Urban failed to materially comply with the Agreement first, and\n\nUrban’s failure to comply was not excused. The jury also found that Urban did not\n\ncomply with its fiduciary duty to Drummond after Drummond signed the\n\nAgreement. The jury awarded zero damages to Urban for Drummond’s breach of\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fcontract and the final judgment ordered that Urban take nothing on its claims against\n\nDrummond. Urban is not challenging the jury’s findings on appeal. Based on the\n\njury’s findings, Drummond’s failure to comply with the Agreement was excused as\n\na matter of law by Urban’s prior material breach. See Mustang Pipeline Co. v. Driver\n\nPipeline Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894516\"><a href=\"/opinion/894516/mustang-pipeline-co-v-driver-pipeline-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 196 (Tex. 2004) (“It is a fundamental principle of\n\ncontract law that when one party to a contract commits a material breach of that\n\ncontract, the other party is discharged or excused from further performance.”).\n\nAccordingly, we hold that Drummond prevailed at trial by successfully defending\n\nagainst the main issue in this case, i.e., Urban’s breach of contract claim. See Bhatia,\n\n396 S.W.3d at 670–71; see also Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">140654</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (stating that parties\n\nwho “obtained favorable findings on all major jury issues” and take-nothing\n\njudgment in their favor were prevailing parties under contract). As the “prevailing\n\nparty” at trial on the main issue in this case, Drummond was entitled to recover his\n\ncosts and reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to the express language of the\n\nAgreement.\n\n      Urban argues that Drummond is not entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to KB\n\nHome because Drummond did not recover any affirmative relief on his\n\n“counterclaim” against Urban for breach of contract. See KB Home, 295 S.W.3d at\n\n654–55 (stating plaintiff must obtain some affirmative relief on his claim in order to\n\nbe prevailing party). However, Drummond asserted an affirmative defense, not a\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fcounterclaim for breach of contract, therefore, KB Home does not prohibit him from\n\nbeing a prevailing party under the Agreement.

As previously discussed,\n\nregardless of whether Urban successfully defended against other issues raised in this\n\ncase, particularly in motion practice, a “prevailing party” is one that succeeds on the\n\nmain issue.

The\n\ntrial court rendered a take-nothing judgment in Drummond’s favor with respect to\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\fthe main issue in this case, Urban’s breach of contract claim, and Urban is not\n\nchallenging that aspect of the trial court’s judgment on appeal.\n\n      Urban also argues that Drummond cannot recover attorney’s fees based on his\n\ndefense of Urban’s breach of contract claim because the jury found that Drummond\n\nbreached the Agreement and there is no jury finding that Drummond’s breach was\n\nexcused. As previously discussed, the jury’s findings—which are not being\n\nchallenged on appeal—demonstrate that Drummond’s failure to comply with the\n\nAgreement was excused as a matter of law by Urban’s prior material breach. See\n\nMustang Pipeline Co., 134 S.W.3d at 196. Because Drummond’s breach was\n\nexcused as a matter of law, no jury finding on this issue was necessary. The jury’s\n\nfinding of breach in this context also does not prevent Drummond from recovering\n\nhis costs and attorney’s fees under the Agreement’s prevailing party provision. See\n\nChevron Phillips Chem. Co., 346 S.W.3d at 71–72 (affirming award of contractual\n\nattorney’s fees to party jury had found failed to comply with contract; party’s failure\n\nto comply was excused by impracticability).\n\n      Urban also cites to several cases for the general proposition that contracting\n\nparties cannot take advantage of favorable provisions of a contract they breached.\n\nAll of these cases, however, are distinguishable because none of them involve a\n\nbreaching party’s attempt to enforce a contractual attorney’s fees provision when\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fthat party’s breach was excused.5\n\n      Urban’s reliance upon dicta in KB Home and on another distinguishable case\n\nis similarly misplaced.6 After acknowledging that “[t]he issue of whether a\n\nbreaching-but-nonpaying defendant can be a ‘prevailing party’ under an\n\nattorney’s-fees provision” was not before the court, the KB Home court stated in a\n\nfootnote that “[w]hen defining litigation success, some might argue that while relief\n\nis required for plaintiffs to prevail, a finding of ‘no breach’ is required for\n\ndefendants—that is, a desired finding on breach is insufficient for plaintiffs but\n\nindispensable for defendants.” KB Home, 295 S.W.3d at 659 n.42.

Later in its amended\n\nmotion for sanctions, Urban argued that “[m]ost of the allegations supporting\n\nDrummond’s” DTPA claim “were contradicted by Drummond’s own testifying\n\nexpert, George Stephens in his deposition,” and that “Drummond and his counsel\n\nfailed to explore and verify any basis for [his] allegations [regarding the validity and\n\nenforceability of the Agreement] from those experts in Texas real estate rules,\n\nregulations, and practices.” Urban did not otherwise specify in its motion why it\n\nbelieved that Drummond’s claim was groundless, brought in bad faith, and for\n\npurpose of harassment.\n\n      Drummond responded to the amended motion, attaching an affidavit from his\n\ncounsel. In that affidavit Drummond’s counsel testified that he had made a\n\nreasonable inquiry into the legal and factual basis for the DTPA claim and that the\n\nclaim was not brought in bad faith or for purpose of harassment. An evidentiary\n\nhearing was not held on Urban’s motion for sanctions.

See Davila, 75 S.W.3d at 542–43 (stating court must examine facts\n\navailable to litigant and circumstances existing when litigant filed his pleading when\n\ndetermining whether DTPA claim is groundless). Drummond’s counsel, however,\n\ntestified that he reviewed the DTPA and “select[ed] those possible claims that could\n\nbe warranted by the facts as [he] then understood them or as [he] reasonably\n\nexpected them to ultimately be after discovery.” Thus, there is some evidence from\n\nwhich the trial court could have determined that the DTPA claim was not groundless.\n\nSee Butnaru v.

Gomer, 419 S.W.3d at 480. In some circumstances, however, the trial\n\ncourt may be able to make a determination by taking judicial notice of items in the\n\ncase file.

As with Rule 13, in order to impose sanctions under Chapter 10,\n\nthe trial court in most cases must hold an evidentiary hearing in order to make the\n\nnecessary factual determinations about the party’s or the attorney’s motives and\n\ncredibility. See Dawson, 258 S.W.3d at 709; Gomer, 419 S.W.3d at 480. The party\n\nmoving for sanctions must prove the pleading party’s subjective state of mind.\n\nWithout an evidentiary hearing, the court may lack evidence to determine whether a\n\npleading or motion was filed in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment.

(holding party waived its right to\n\nsanctions pursuant to Chapter 10 and Rule 215 by failing to request and obtain\n\nhearing on sanctions motion for matters known to party prior to trial). In this case,\n\nUrban did not request sanctions based on these allegedly false and misleading\n\nstatements until after trial. Moreover, Urban’s amended motion reflects that its\n\nrequest for sanctions is based entirely upon pre-trial events that, in one case, were\n\nknown to Urban well in advance of trial (i.e., Drummond’s October 2012 response).\n\nAs was the case in Finlay, “the pre-trial conduct matters at issue . . . were all\n\ncomplete before trial; no trial testimony was needed to determine whether improper\n\nconduct known before trial warranted sanctions.” Id. at 526. Urban argues that its\n\n\n                                         35\n\famended motion is timely because the trial court has plenary power to grant a\n\nsanctions motion filed after a final judgment has been rendered for filing groundless\n\npleadings pursuant to Rule 13 and Chapter 10.

Drummond’s “Groundless” Claims and Defenses\n\n      On appeal, Urban argues that it is entitled to sanctions against Drummond\n\nbased on Drummond’s filing of groundless claims and defenses in bad faith and with\n\nintent to harass. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 13. At the outset, we note that Urban did not\n\nrequest sanctions based on Drummond’s claims for fraud and class relief in its\n\namended motion for sanctions. Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion when it refused to award Urban attorney’s fees based on Drummond’s\n\nfiling of these claims. See Ball, 48 S.W.3d at 338 (holding trial court erred in\n\nimposing sanctions when motion did not request sanctions on that ground).\n\n      With respect to Drummond’s other allegedly groundless claims and defenses,\n\nDrummond responded to the amended motion for sanctions, attaching an affidavit\n\nfrom his counsel in which he stated that he made what he considered to be a\n\nreasonable inquiry into the legal and factual basis of these claims when he filed the\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fpleading in question and responded to the various motions for summary judgment\n\non those claims. Drummond’s counsel also testified that he “unequivocally” denied\n\nfiling any of these claims or defenses for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith.\n\nThus, there is some evidence from which the trial court could have determined that\n\nthese claims and defenses were not groundless. Accordingly, based on the record\n\nbefore us, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied\n\nUrban’s motion for sanctions on this ground.

Discovery Abuses\n\n      Urban also sought sanctions against Drummond for pretrial discovery abuses\n\nrelating to Drummond’s alleged refusal to appear for deposition and his refusal to\n\nanswer questions during his deposition. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 215.2(b)(2) (authorizing\n\ncourt to impose monetary penalty against party, or advising attorney, who fails to\n\ncomply with order compelling discovery or abuses discovery process). A party’s\n\nfailure to obtain a pretrial ruling on discovery disputes existing before trial begins\n\nconstitutes a waiver of the issue on appeal. See Remington Arms Co., Inc. v.\n\nCaldwell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1717670\"><a href=\"/opinion/1717670/remington-arms-co-inc-v-caldwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 170 (Tex. 1993); see also Finlay, 77 S.W.3d at 525.\n\nAlthough Urban filed motions to compel Drummond’s deposition testimony, the\n\nappellate record does not reflect that Urban ever obtained a ruling on its motions.\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\fAccordingly, Urban has waived any claim for sanctions based on these pretrial\n\ndiscovery abuses. Id.\n\n          iv.   “Pattern of Conduct”\n\n      Urban also argues on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion when it\n\nrefused to award it sanctions because Drummond and his counsel “engaged in a\n\npattern of conduct” that resulted in “needless expense, delay and waste of judicial\n\nresources.” Urban did not raise this argument in its amended motion for sanctions\n\nand Urban’s “pattern of conduct” argument is not an independent ground for the\n\nimposition of sanctions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not sanctioning\n\nDrummond and awarding Urban attorney’s fees on this basis.\n\nC.    Urban’s Claim for Mandatory Attorney’s Fees with Respect to\n      Drummond’s Third-Party Petitions\n\n      In addition to seeking recovery of the attorney’s fees Urban incurred\n\ndefending itself against Drummond’s counterclaims, Urban is also seeking\n\nattorney’s fees from Drummond based on Drummond’s filing of third-party\n\npetitions against Urban’s counsel (Di Ferrante), Urban’s president and CEO\n\n(Ramani), and an Urban employee (Silaski). Urban contends that Drummond’s third-\n\nparty DTPA and TDCA claims are groundless and have no basis in law or fact and\n\nseeks to recover the attorney’s fees Urban incurred defending Di Ferrante, Silaski,\n\nand Ramani against these claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\f      Drummond nonsuited all of his claims against Di Ferrante, Silaski, and\n\nRamani without prejudice in October 2012. Urban and Drummond tried the\n\nremaining claims to a jury in November 2013. The record reflects that Urban did not\n\nattempt to recover attorney’s fees it incurred defending Di Ferrante, Silaski, and\n\nRamani against Drummond’s DTPA and TDCA claims pursuant to Chapter 10 and\n\nRule 13 until Urban’s post-trial amended motion for sanctions, which was filed in\n\nDecember 2013—14 months after the nonsuit.\n\n      As previously discussed, “[s]anctions for alleged violations known to movants\n\nbefore trial are waived if a hearing and ruling are not secured pretrial.” Finlay, 77\n\nS.W.3d at 525; see generally Remington Arms, 850 S.W.2d at 170 (holding that “the\n\nfailure to obtain a pretrial ruling on discovery disputes that exist before\n\ncommencement of trial constitutes a waiver of any claim for sanctions based on that\n\nconduct”). Urban did not request sanctions for these pretrial matters until after trial.\n\nAs was the case in Finlay, “the pre-trial conduct matters at issue . . . were all\n\ncomplete before trial; no trial testimony was needed to determine whether improper\n\nconduct known before trial warranted sanctions.” Finlay, 77 S.W.3d at 526.\n\n      Urban waived its right to sanctions based on Drummond’s filing of the\n\nthird-party complaints by failing to move for sanctions and request and obtain\n\nhearing on its sanctions motion for matters known to the party prior to trial. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\fD.    Conclusion\n\n      Having determined that Urban waived its right to sanctions or that the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by denying Urban’s amended motion for sanctions,\n\nwe overrule Urban’s fourth issue.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the portion of the trial court’s judgment awarding Drummond his\n\nattorney’s fees and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion on this issue. We affirm the trial court’s denial of Urban’s amended motion\n\nfor sanctions and affirm the judgment in all other respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Russell Lloyd\n                                              Justice\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Massengale, and Lloyd.\n\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\f</pre>",
