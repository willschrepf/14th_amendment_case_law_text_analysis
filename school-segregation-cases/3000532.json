Graves,\n           Defendants-Appellants.          )   Judge Presiding.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n          JUSTICE McCULLOUGH delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n          On February 10, 2006, plaintiff, Eugene Robert Bilski,\n\nan inmate at Pontiac Correctional Center (PCC), pro se filed an\n\namended complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief\n\nagainst defendants, Roger Walker, Jr., Director of the Illinois\n\nDepartment of Corrections (DOC); Guy Pierce, warden of PCC;\n\nRandall Taylor, superintendent of School District No. 428; Blair\n\nLeibach, assistant warden of operations for PCC; and Robert\n\fGriffin, assistant warden of programs for PCC.     On February 15,\n\n2006, plaintiff Michael Ruiz, an inmate at PCC, pro se filed a\n\ncomplaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against\n\ndefendants Walker, Pierce, and Taylor.\n\n          After a combined evidentiary hearing, the trial court\n\nentered orders in each case requiring defendants to \"allow a\n\nwilling staff member of DOC to proctor examinations to the\n\nplaintiff in his pursuit of approved correspondence courses for\n\ncollege credit, upon the plaintiff satisfying his burden of\n\nsecuring a willing proctor and an available time, date, and\n\nlocation for such examinations.\"   Defendants filed notices of\n\nappeal, docketed as No. 4-08-0126 and No. 4-08-0127.     At defen-\n\ndants' request, we have consolidated these appeals.\n\n          Plaintiffs here are inmates of PCC.     Plaintiffs re-\n\nquested a staff member be allowed to proctor correspondence-\n\ncourse exams.   Plaintiffs' request was denied.    Plaintiffs filed\n\na four-count complaint for declaratory judgement and injunctive\n\nrelief against defendants requesting the trial court compel\n\ndefendants to allow a staff member to proctor correspondence-\n\ncourse exams.   The court filed as stated.   This appeal followed.\n\n          Before addressing the merits of the appeal, we consider\n\ndefendants' motion to strike portions of plaintiffs' brief.\n\nDefendants have moved to strike those portions of plaintiffs'\n\nbrief that refer to facts not in evidence.   Plaintiffs filed an\n\n\n                               - 2 -\n\fobjection and a response thereto, and this court ordered defen-\n\ndants' motion be taken with the case.    \"The general rule is that\n\n'material which was not part of the court record or considered by\n\nthe trial court is not part of the record on appeal and should\n\nnot be considered by the appellate court.'\"    Doyle Plumbing &\n\nHeating Co. v. Board of Education, Quincy Public District No.\n\n172, 291 Ill. App. 3d 221, 229-30, 683 N.E.2d 530, 536 (1997),\n\nquoting Smith v. First National Bank of Danville, 254 Ill. App.\n\n3d 251, 258, 624 N.E.2d 899, 905 (1993).    We find no reason to\n\ndeviate from that rule in this case.    We will not consider the\n\nportions of plaintiffs' brief that refer to facts not in evi-\n\ndence.\n\n          A prisoner has no liberty or property interest in\n\nattending an educational program.   See Murdock v. Washington, 193\n\nF.3d 510, 513 (7th Cir. 1999); 20 Ill. Adm. Code ยง405.20(a), as\n\namended by 18 Ill. Reg. 2970, 2974 (eff. February 14, 1994)\n\n(\"[n]othing in this [p]art shall be construed to require educa-\n\ntional opportunities for all committed persons\"); see also Hadley\n\nv. Snyder, 335 Ill. App. 3d 347, 354, 780 N.E.2d 316, 323 (2002)\n\n(a prisoner does not have a liberty interest in attending educa-\n\ntional or recreational programs); Williams v. Thompson, 111 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 145, 148-51, 443 N.E.2d 809, 810-12 (1982) (reversing a\n\npreliminary injunction requiring prison officials to allow\n\ninmates to complete vocational training programs for lack of\n\n\n                              - 3 -\n\fright to participate in said programs).    In the instant case,\n\nplaintiffs have not shown that limitations on access to a staff\n\nmember to proctor correspondence-course exams affected plain-\n\ntiffs' liberty or property interests.    Consequently, these\n\nlimitations did not violate plaintiffs' right to due process.\n\n          Plaintiffs contended that limitations on their access\n\nto postsecondary programs as prisoners confined in protective\n\ncustody, as compared to the general prison population, violated\n\ntheir equal-protection rights.    DOC operates its protective\n\ncustody units under a consent decree, Meeks v. Lane, No. 75-C-96\n\n(N.D. Ill. 1981), issued by a three-judge panel of the United\n\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.      The\n\ndecree requires defendants to provide inmates in protective\n\ncustody \"educational opportunities commensurate with those\n\navailable to inmates in the general population.\"    In this case,\n\nPCC does not house a general population.\n\n          Moreover, prison officials do not violate the equal-\n\nprotection clause when they treat protective-custody inmates\n\ndifferently from general-population inmates based on legitimate\n\npenological concerns.   French v. Owens, 777 F.2d 1250, 1256 (7th\n\nCir. 1985).   Restrictions on plaintiffs' access to a staff member\n\nto proctor correspondence-course exams were based on \"limited\n\nresources and budgetary constraints.\"    Because these limitations\n\nwere based on legitimate penological concerns, plaintiffs failed\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\fto show that restricted access to postsecondary educational\n\nprograms violated plaintiffs' equal-protection rights.\n\n          Similarly, plaintiffs contended that limitations on\n\ntheir access to postsecondary programs as male inmates at PCC, as\n\ncompared to female inmates at Dwight Correctional Center (DCC),\n\nviolated their equal-protection rights.   Male and female prison-\n\ners are often not similarly situated in relevant respects for\n\npurposes of asserting equal-protection claims.   See Klinger v.\n\nDepartment of Corrections, 107 F.3d 609, 612 (8th Cir. 1997)\n\n(male prisoners housed in multiple institutions and female\n\nprisoners housed in one not similarly situated for purposes of\n\naccess to programs and services based on differences in prison\n\ndemographics); Keevan v. Smith, 100 F.3d 644, 648 (8th Cir. 1996)\n\n(male and female inmates not similarly situated for purposes of\n\nprison programming based on different number of male and female\n\ninmates, differences in sentences served, and classification\n\nlevels of male and female inmates); Women Prisoners of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia Department of Corrections v. District of\n\nColumbia, 93 F.3d 910, 924-27 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (male and female\n\ninmates housed in separate prisons not similarly situated for\n\npurposes of access to programs and services); Timm v. Gunter, 917\n\nF.2d 1093, 1102 (8th Cir.1990) (male and female inmates not\n\nsimilarly situated for purposes of pat-down searches by opposite-\n\nsex guards); Pargo v. Elliott, 894 F. Supp. 1243, 1261 (S.D. Iowa\n\n\n                              - 5 -\n\f1995) (male and female inmates not similarly situated for pur-\n\nposes of inmate security and programming where male inmates\n\nhoused in different facilities by security classifications and\n\nfemale inmates housed together, served shorter sentences, and had\n\nspecial characteristics).\n\n           Defendants' affidavits in support of their response to\n\na motion for summary judgment by plaintiffs stated that DCC\n\nhouses a total of 977 female inmates.    Thirty-four inmates are\n\nheld in segregation status and nine are in protective custody.\n\nThe remaining 934 inmates are made up of multilevel classifica-\n\ntions.   In comparison, PCC houses 1,619 inmates.   Three hundred\n\nninety-eight are held in a medium-security unit, six hundred\n\nninety-eight are in segregation, and five hundred are in protec-\n\ntive custody.    DCC is classified as maximum security because it\n\nis the only DOC facility to house maximum-security female inmates\n\nin Illinois.    However, the maximum-security inmates make up a\n\nsmall percentage of the overall population.    In comparison, PCC's\n\nprimary purpose is to house long-term disciplinary-segregation\n\nand protective-custody inmates.    Female inmates housed in DCC's\n\nsegregation- and protective-custody units do not participate in\n\neducational programing that is also not available to those\n\ninmates at PCC.\n\n           Thus, the programs at PCC and DCC reflect separate sets\n\nof decisions based on entirely different circumstances.    Program\n\n\n                                - 6 -\n\fpriorities differ from prison to prison depending on innumerable\n\nvariables that officials must take into account.    PCC and DCC are\n\ndifferent institutions with different inmates, each operating\n\nwith limited resources to fulfill different specific needs.\n\nThus, plaintiffs and DCC inmates are not similarly situated for\n\npurposes of prison programs and services and plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to make the requisite threshold showing that they are\n\nsimilarly situated to the group that they claim receives favor-\n\nable treatment.   For this reason, plaintiffs have not suffered an\n\nequal-protection violation.\n\n          Likewise, neither the provisions in the Unified Code of\n\nCorrections (Unified Code) nor the Illinois Constitution, each of\n\nwhich propounds general policies of rehabilitation and restora-\n\ntion to useful citizenship, creates an entitlement to participate\n\nin postsecondary education.   See 730 ILCS 5/1-1-2 (West 2004)\n\n(concerning restoration to useful citizenship); 730 ILCS 5/3-7-1\n\n(West 2004) (requiring DOC to promulgate rules in compliance with\n\nthe Unified Code); Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, ยง11.   Instead,\n\nwhether a prisoner may \"secur[e] a willing proctor and an avail-\n\nable time, date, and location for *** examinations\" is a matter\n\nof discretion solely for DOC.   See 730 ILCS 5/3-6-2(d) (West\n\n2004) (postsecondary opportunities encouraged \"wherever possi-\n\nble\"); 20 Ill. Adm. Code ยง405.20(a)(1)(D), as amended by 18 Ill.\n\nReg. 2970, 2974 (eff. February 14, 1994) (adult-division educa-\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\ftional provisions shall include postsecondary education \"where\n\npossible\").\n\n          Courts are not to intervene in matters within the\n\ndiscretion of DOC, including whether a staff member may proctor\n\ncorrespondence-course exams.   As such, ruling on plaintiffs'\n\nrequest to allow a staff member to proctor correspondence-course\n\nexams exceeds the scope of the trial courtโs authority.\n\n          Because plaintiffs had no right to proctored\n\ncorrespondence-course exams, the trial court abused its discre-\n\ntion by entering the injunction below, and we reverse.\n\n          Reversed.\n\n          TURNER and STEIGMANN, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 8 -\n\f",

Iowa\n\n\n                              - 5 -\n\f1995) (male and female inmates not similarly situated for pur-\n\nposes of inmate security and programming where male inmates\n\nhoused in different facilities by security classifications and\n\nfemale inmates housed together, served shorter sentences, and had\n\nspecial characteristics).\n\n           Defendants' affidavits in support of their response to\n\na motion for summary judgment by plaintiffs stated that DCC\n\nhouses a total of 977 female inmates.    Thirty-four inmates are\n\nheld in segregation status and nine are in protective custody.\n\nThe remaining 934 inmates are made up of multilevel classifica-\n\ntions.   In comparison, PCC houses 1,619 inmates.   Three hundred\n\nninety-eight are held in a medium-security unit, six hundred\n\nninety-eight are in segregation, and five hundred are in protec-\n\ntive custody.    DCC is classified as maximum security because it\n\nis the only DOC facility to house maximum-security female inmates\n\nin Illinois.    However, the maximum-security inmates make up a\n\nsmall percentage of the overall population.    In comparison, PCC's\n\nprimary purpose is to house long-term disciplinary-segregation\n\nand protective-custody inmates.    Female inmates housed in DCC's\n\nsegregation- and protective-custody units do not participate in\n\neducational programing that is also not available to those\n\ninmates at PCC.\n\n           Thus, the programs at PCC and DCC reflect separate sets\n\nof decisions based on entirely different circumstances.    Program\n\n\n                                - 6 -\n\fpriorities differ from prison to prison depending on innumerable\n\nvariables that officials must take into account.    PCC and DCC are\n\ndifferent institutions with different inmates, each operating\n\nwith limited resources to fulfill different specific needs.\n\nThus, plaintiffs and DCC inmates are not similarly situated for\n\npurposes of prison programs and services and plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to make the requisite threshold showing that they are\n\nsimilarly situated to the group that they claim receives favor-\n\nable treatment.   For this reason, plaintiffs have not suffered an\n\nequal-protection violation.\n\n          Likewise, neither the provisions in the Unified Code of\n\nCorrections (Unified Code) nor the Illinois Constitution, each of\n\nwhich propounds general policies of rehabilitation and restora-\n\ntion to useful citizenship, creates an entitlement to participate\n\nin postsecondary education.   See 730 ILCS 5/1-1-2 (West 2004)\n\n(concerning restoration to useful citizenship); 730 ILCS 5/3-7-1\n\n(West 2004) (requiring DOC to promulgate rules in compliance with\n\nthe Unified Code); Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, ยง11.   Instead,\n\nwhether a prisoner may \"secur[e] a willing proctor and an avail-\n\nable time, date, and location for *** examinations\" is a matter\n\nof discretion solely for DOC.   See 730 ILCS 5/3-6-2(d) (West\n\n2004) (postsecondary opportunities encouraged \"wherever possi-\n\nble\"); 20 Ill. Adm. Code ยง405.20(a)(1)(D), as amended by 18 Ill.\n\nReg. 2970, 2974 (eff. February 14, 1994) (adult-division educa-\n\n\n                                - 7 -\n\ftional provisions shall include postsecondary education \"where\n\npossible\").\n\n          Courts are not to intervene in matters within the\n\ndiscretion of DOC, including whether a staff member may proctor\n\ncorrespondence-course exams.   As such, ruling on plaintiffs'\n\nrequest to allow a staff member to proctor correspondence-course\n\nexams exceeds the scope of the trial courtโs authority.\n\n          Because plaintiffs had no right to proctored\n\ncorrespondence-course exams, the trial court abused its discre-\n\ntion by entering the injunction below, and we reverse.\n\n          Reversed.\n\n          TURNER and STEIGMANN, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 8 -\n\f</pre>",
