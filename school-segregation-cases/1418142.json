Tipton\nJudge\n\n                                       OPINION\n\n\n\n              The petitioner, Victor James Cazes, appeals as of right from the order of\n\nthe Shelby County Criminal Court denying him post-conviction relief from his 1990\n\fconvictions for felony murder, aggravated rape and first degree burglary. The petitioner\n\nwas sentenced to death for the murder conviction and received twenty-five-year and\n\nsix-year sentences, respectively, for the aggravated rape and burglary convictions. The\njudgments of conviction were affirmed on direct appeal. State v. Cazes, 875 S.W.2d\n\n253 (Tenn. 1994). In this post-conviction appeal, the petitioner raises the following\n\nissues:\n              (1) whether the trial judge at the evidentiary hearing should\n              have recused himself and reassigned the petition to another\n              division of the trial court;\n\n              (2) whether the petitioner was denied the effective assistance\n              of counsel;\n\n              (3) whether the petitioner was denied his right to an impartial\n              jury;\n\n              (4) whether the use of the petitioner’s felony convictions as an\n              aggravating circumstance violated the principles of due\n              process and ex post facto;\n\n              (5) whether the state withheld exculpatory information;\n\n              (6) whether the reasonable doubt jury instructions were\n              constitutional;\n\n              (7) whether the cumulative effect of the foregoing errors\n              deprived the petitioner of a fair trial and due process;\n\n              (8) whether a harmless error analysis relative to invalid\n              aggravating circumstances is constitutional; and\n              (9) whether the trial court erred by not conducting an in camera\n              review of the prosecutor’s files.\n\nWe affirm the trial court’s denial of the post-conviction petition.\n\n\n              The facts surrounding the crimes in this case are described by the\n\nTennessee Supreme Court in its opinion on direct appeal as follows:\n                     The State’s proof introduced at the guilt phase of trial\n              demonstrated that on Sunday morning, April 24, 1988, the\n              body of Gladys Skinner, an older woman who lived alone, was\n              found in her home in the Frayser area of Memphis. She had\n              last been seen alive late Saturday night by Ben Harris, a friend\n              who brought her home from a card game. After checking Ms.\n              Skinner’s house to make sure everything was “safe and\n              secure,” Harris left around 12:10 a.m.\n\n                     The next morning, because her telephone was busy\n              each time they called, Gladys Skinner’s daughter and\n              grandson went to her house to check on her. When they\n              arrived, they noticed that a front window screen had been\n              removed, that the window was broken, that blood was on the\n              window blinds, and that the doors to the house were locked.\n              The grandson and a neighbor entered the house through the\n\n                                              2\n\ffront window and found Gladys Skinner’s body lying beneath\nsome bedcovers on the bedroom floor, between the bed and\nthe wall. The wall next to the bed was spattered with blood as\nwere several pictures from the wall that lay broken on the floor.\nBlood also stained the floor and the fitted sheet on the bed.\nWhile the bedroom had been ransacked, nothing of value was\nmissing from the house.\n\n        Gladys Skinner’s nude body was lying face down, her\nknees underneath her with her buttocks “jacked up off the\nfloor” and her legs spread apart. Scrape marks were found on\nher inner legs and vagina. Her right breast had been bitten\nand her left breast was scraped. Dilation of the vagina and\nrectum demonstrated penetration at or after the time of death;\nhowever, no sperm were found. Numerous marks and bruises\nwere found on her body, including defensive wounds to her\narms and hands, and a large bruise on her back that the proof\nindicated could have been caused by a fist.\n\n        The Shelby County medical examiner testified that the\nvictim’s death was caused by skull injuries that were inflicted\nby multiple blows to the head with a blunt instrument, like a\nwelder’s chipping hammer. According to the medical examiner\nand a forensic anthropologist who examined the skull, the\nnumber of blows had ranged from eight to fifteen and the skull\nhad been “virtually shattered” by the force of the blows. Their\nproof showed that one or more of these injuries would have\ncaused death within minutes to an hour, but the victim would\nnot necessarily have lost consciousness immediately. A\nforensic serologist’s testimony indicated that the assault may\nhave continued for some time. The serologist testified that\nsome blows may have been struck after the blood from some\nof the wounds had begun clotting, and that it takes three to\nfifteen minutes for blood to clot outside the body.\n\n       At the time of the murder, the defendant, Victor Cazes,\na welder, worked sporadically as a handyman at an automotive\nrepair garage owned by Michael Lucas, Gladys Skinner’s step-\ngrandchild. Before the murder, Cazes had been to Gladys\nSkinner’s house two to three times to work on her car. On\nSaturday night, April 23, 1988, Cazes attended a birthday\ncookout at Lucas’s home, which was a few blocks from\nSkinner’s house. He left the gathering alone around 10 or 11\np.m.\n\n         Circumstantial evidence tied the defendant, Victor\nCazes, to the offense. His finger and palm prints were found\non the front window screen and frame. Two of his fingerprints\nwere lifted from a light bulb beside the back door and fresh pry\nmarks were found on the [back door]. Gladys Skinner routinely\nleft this back light on at night, and it was on when Ben Harris\nleft her house shortly after midnight Sunday morning. When\nher body was found, the light was off and the bulb was loose\nin its socket, as if it had been unscrewed.\n\n        Michael Lucas testified that Victor Cazes owned two or\nthree chipping hammers, which Lucas described as blunt\ninstruments made entirely of steel with a point on one end, a\nchisel flat on the other end, and a coil-wired handle. A forensic\nanthropologist testified that a pattern of depressions located in\nthe involved portion of the victim’s skull were consistent with\nridges on the striking surface of a particular welder’s chipping\nhammer owned by Cazes. The hammer had been crafted into\na metal knick-knack by Cazes after the crime and given to a\nfriend’s mother. The forensic serologist also testified that a\n\n                               3\n\ftransfer blood stain on the victim’s bedsheet was caused by\ncontact with a wet, bloody object which was consistent with the\nsize and shape of this same chipping hammer and another like\nit that Cazes had left at the home of his friend’s mother.\n\n       Dr. Richard Souviron, a forensic odontologist, testified\nthat, based upon his comparison of the bite marks on Gladys\nSkinner’s breasts with molds and models of Cazes’ teeth, he\nhad concluded to a reasonable degree of dental certainty that\nCazes’ teeth had made the bite marks on the victim’s body at\nor about the time of her death. Another forensic odontologist,\nDr. Harry Mincer, testified that the defendant Cazes could have\nmade the bite marks on the victim. Two women who had\nengaged in sexual intercourse with Cazes testified that he had\nalso bitten them, and that the victim’s body position was one\nhe preferred during sex.\n\n       The defendant presented no proof.\n\n      Based on this evidence in the guilt phase, the jury found\nthe defendant, Victor Cazes, guilty of first-degree felony\nmurder in the perpetration of rape, and also guilty of\naggravated rape and first-degree burglary.\n        In the sentencing phase of the trial, the State relied\nupon the evidence presented during the guilt phase and also\nintroduced records of the defendant’s previous convictions in\nShelby County, Tennessee, in February 1990 for “assault [with\nintent to commit murder in the first degree] with bodily injury”\nand for aggravated rape.\n\n\n        In mitigation, the defendant introduced medical records\nfrom the period of his incarceration in the Shelby County Jail\nto show that he had required medical treatment on several\noccasions as a result of fights, and that he had been placed on\nsuicide watch twice while incarcerated. An acquaintance\ntestified that the defendant was a heavy user of alcohol,\nmarijuana and cocaine, and that he sometimes could not\nremember what he had done while he was intoxicated.\n\n        The defendant and two of his brothers testified about his\nbackground. One of twelve children, the defendant had been\nunable to control his urination until he was twenty. He testified\nthat his father had beaten him when he was young. One\nbrother described the defendant as “hot-tempered” and\n“always fighting.” The defendant said that he fought because\nother people would tease him when he wet on himself. In the\nseventh grade, after being arrested for truancy, the defendant\nset fire to his jail cell. He underwent a psychiatric examination\nand was sent to reform school, where the fights continued.\nAfter his release from reform school, the defendant married\ntwice. He has one child from his second marriage. The\ndefendant had worked for a substantial wage as a welder in\nLouisiana, and a brother described him as a “hard-working\nman.” The defendant testified he began drinking after his first\ndivorce and admitted using various drugs and flying into rages.\n\n       As to the crime itself, the defendant testified that on\nSaturday night, April 23, 1988, he was “full of it” and “well on\n[his] way” to being drunk when he left the cookout at Michael\nLucas’s home. After leaving the cookout, he drank a bottle of\nJim Beam on his way to a bar where he “got totally drunk.” He\nstated that he remembered nothing more about the night.\n\n\n                               4\n\f                                Dr. Wyatt Nichols, a clinical psychologist, testified that\n                         while the defendant was competent to stand trial and not\n                         legally insane, there were signs to indicate psychological\n                         problems. Dr. Nichols specifically mentioned the defendant’s\n                         long history of chemical dependency and multiple drug abuse.\n                         He also suggested that the defendant might have an impulse\n                         control problem which, along with the history of bedwetting,\n                         was possibly indicative of minimal neurological damage.\n                                Based on the proof, the jury found the existence of three\n                         aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, which\n                         were: (1) that the defendant had been previously convicted of\n                         violent felony offenses; (2) that the murder was especially\n                         heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or\n                         depravity of mind; and (3) that the murder was committed while\n                         the defendant was engaged in committing a felony. Tenn.\n                         Code Ann. § 39-2-203(i)(2), (5), and (7) (1982).1 In addition,\n                         the jury found that the mitigating circumstances were not\n\n\n                         sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating\n                         circumstance and as a result, sentenced the defendant to\n                         death.\n        Cazes, 875 S.W.2d at 257-59.\n\n\n                         At the post-conviction evidentiary hearing, Gloria Shettles, a private\n\n        investigator hired on behalf of the petitioner, testified that she obtained the names of\n\n        twenty-eight witnesses from the prosecutor’s original trial files. She said she located\n\n        fifteen of these witnesses and interviewed nine of them, including former employers.\n\n        Ms. Shettles testified that those interviewed were very cooperative but that they could\n        not recall some information. She said that three of the petitioner’s former employers\n\n        indicated that the petitioner was an excellent worker but that the petitioner had difficulty\n\n        getting along with coworkers and following directions. Ms. Shettles said that the\n        employers also reported that the petitioner did not take criticism well and was impatient,\n\n        emotional and impulsive. Ms. Shettles said that others told her that the petitioner was\n\n        quiet and a loner. Ms. Shettles testified as follows:\n                         A lot of these people had been, or had observed [the\n                         petitioner] when he was drinking. And so a lot of their remarks\n                         had to do with a definite change in his behavior under the\n                         influence of alcohol. And they spoke to that . . . . They talked\n                         about [the petitioner] literally being in control one minute and\n                         not being in control the next. They couldn’t give -- they were\n                         consistent in their remarks, but they couldn’t give me any basis\n                         for it, even in their opinion. That he was sitting there and was\n                         fine, and then the next minute [he] might become very angry\n                         at somebody and would act out on that anger . . . . Well,\n                         people made -- almost everyone made a remark such as, it\n                         seemed as though he had a mental problem. He might have\n\n\n1\n    The felon y murd er aggra vating circ umsta nce w as reve rsed on appea l, and the su preme court\n        found that its application was harmless.\n\n                                                               5\n\f              had a split personality. Obviously, these people aren’t experts.\n              But, in their opinion he would have a wild look, for instance,\n              after he was drinking. There was a noticeable change that\n              they could describe.\n\nMs. Shettles testified that the information she gathered from her interviews was\n\nconsistent with the information found in the police reports.\n\n\n              Dr. Pamela Auble, a clinical neuropsychologist, testified that she\n\nconducted a psychological and neuropsychological evaluation of the petitioner. Dr.\nAuble stated that before testifying at the evidentiary hearing, she reviewed a social\n\nhistory prepared by Sarah Ottinger; reports prepared by Drs. Rossby, Nurcombe and\n\nSmith; and the results of tests she administered on the petitioner, including an\nintelligence test, an achievement test in reading and writing, a memory test, two tests of\n\nmental flexibility, two language tests, two tests of motor speed and dexterity, and five\n\npersonality tests. Dr. Auble said she also interviewed the petitioner.\n\n\n              Dr. Auble testified that the petitioner was cooperative during the tests and\n\nthe interview. She also stated:\n\n              [T]here was no evidence, or no strong and conclusive\n              evidence that the memory and thinking that [the petitioner]\n              does is a lot different from what other people do. A problem\n              that would indicate or suggest that parts of his brain, you know\n              there might be holes in parts of his brain, or damage in certain\n              areas of his brain. . . . It’s known that, things like head injuries,\n              often cause emotional lack of control, impulsiveness and an\n              inability to control emotions. But, they’re also associated with\n              difficulties with memory and thinking. I didn’t really find that\n              with [the petitioner], which indicates to me that the troubles that\n              he has controlling his emotions are more likely to be the result\n              of a chemical imbalance, or something along that line, rather\n              than the results of a head injury, per se.\n\nWith regard to the personality tests, Dr. Auble testified as follows:\n              [The petitioner] is someone who tends to brood and ruminate\n              about wrongs that have been done to him. He thinks a great\n              deal. He has probably a rich internal life, that is how he kind\n              of copes with his world. He kind of retreats into fantasy or\n              thinking. The personality testing indicated that he can be\n              impulsive and he can act out under stress. He doesn’t have\n              very good emotional controls. From the personality testing [the\n              petitioner] is somebody who has a lot of difficulty relating to\n              other people. Some parts of him wants [sic] closeness, other\n              parts feel angry and rejected. He is ambivalent about both\n              women and men, and in general, I think, tries to keep people\n              at a distance. He tends to be suspicious of people. You know,\n              to believe that others would hurt him if they were given the\n              chance. There was also evidence on the personality testing of\n              confusion about sexuality, and [mother-son] relationships.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f              Regarding the petitioner’s social history, Dr. Auble testified that the\n\npetitioner is the ninth of eleven children and that until he was in his twenties, the\n\npetitioner suffered from enuresis, which caused the petitioner to urinate on himself both\nwhile asleep and awake. Dr. Auble stated that because of this condition, the petitioner\n\nwas “picked on” by his family and other children. Dr. Auble testified about physical\n\nabuse the petitioner suffered from both parents at an early age, fights he had with his\nsiblings, and discipline problems he had in school, including an attack on a teacher and\n\na principal and his inability to relate to other students, which led to expulsion from two\n\nelementary schools.\n\n\n              Dr. Auble testified that she diagnosed the petitioner with intermittent\n\nexplosive disorder, which she said is consistent with Dr. Rossby’s finding of low\nserotonin levels. With respect to serotonin, Dr. Auble stated that:\n\n              Serotonin is a neuro-transmitter. It’s one of several in the\n              brain. Neuro-transmitters have various functions. Serotonin\n              has been associated, primarily, with inhibitory functions.\n              Specifically, and probably the most relevant for this inhibitor,\n              are functions of the amygdala which is a brain structure, kind\n              of in the mid-brain limbic system. The amygdala is responsible\n              for emotional memory. Disruption of amygdala function causes\n              rage reactions. A low serotonin level would be something that\n              would decrease inhibition in the amygdala, making it more\n              likely that a rage reaction might occur.\n\nDr. Auble testified that the petitioner’s intermittent explosive disorder is “characterized\nby periods of rage, which are often triggered by fairly minor events, during which the\n\nperson has no control . . . [a]nd then, they eventually subside.” According to Dr. Auble,\n\nthe petitioner has suffered from this disorder since childhood. Dr. Auble testified that\nthis disorder could be attributed to traumatic experiences the petitioner had as a child,\n\nas well as the petitioner’s low serotonin level. Dr. Auble stated that the petitioner would\n\nsometimes enter a dissociative state, triggered by a minor event related to past\ntraumatic experiences, and afterward, the petitioner would have no memory of what\n\noccurred while he was in that state. Dr. Auble also concluded that the petitioner\n\nexhibited schizotypal personality disorder with antisocial and compulsive traits.\n\n\n\n\n              Dr. Auble testified that the petitioner’s history of alcohol and drug abuse\n\nwould contribute to lowering his serotonin levels and inhibitions. Dr. Auble testified that:\n\n                                              7\n\f               [the petitioner’s] violence towards women increased, from the\n               time he was married and coincided with the greater alcohol\n               use . . . . Yes. Certainly, a correlation, yes. An association\n               between the disinhibition of alcohol and, you know, [the\n               petitioner] has just immense amounts of underlying anger. A\n               lot of that towards women. In the context of alcohol and\n               substance abuse, in the context of relating to a woman, you\n               know, those would come together and make it more likely for\n               him to experience anger, rage, intermittent explosive disorder\n               and dissociative episodes.\n\n\n\n               Dr. Auble testified that had she been contacted before trial, she would\nhave recommended further analysis and investigation of the petitioner’s brain\n\nchemistry, specifically testing of the cerebrum spinal fluid, which would have shown the\n\nlow serotonin levels. Dr. Auble explained that “given the organic and psychological\nproblems, the history of physical and emotion [sic] abuse and neglect, the intoxication\n\nat the time, that it is . . . likelier than not that [the petitioner] was in a dissociative state\n\nand was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, unable to control\nhis behavior.”\n\n\n\n               Dr. Auble testified that she did not personally perform all the tests\n\nadministered on the petitioner during the evaluation; only reviewed a summary of the\n\ntranscript prepared by post-conviction counsel; and did not discuss the matter with Dr.\nNichols, the defense expert at trial, except for reviewing his notes and data. Dr. Auble\n\ntestified that she did not remember whether she asked the petitioner about the events\n\nsurrounding the murder or whether he was using alcohol or drugs at the time. She\ntestified, however, that she believed that another expert was supposed to focus on that\n\naspect.\n\n\n\n               Dr. Murray Smith, a specialist in internal and addiction medicine and the\n\nMedical Director of Baptist Hospital’s drug and alcohol treatment center, testified that he\n\nevaluated the petitioner both medically and in terms of addiction medicine. Dr. Smith\n\ntestified that he reviewed summaries of the trial transcript and previous medical records\nprepared by post-conviction counsel; the reports of Drs. Rossby, Auble and Nurcombe;\n\nthe social history prepared by Sarah Ottinger, and he interviewed the petitioner for\n\nabout four hours. Dr. Smith stated that he also performed blood and glucose tests on\nthe petitioner. Dr. Smith testified that the petitioner exhibited signs of hypoglycemia,\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fwhich is a significantly low blood sugar level that results in stressful, hyper-irritable and\n\nexcitable feelings. He said that adrenaline levels would increase to raise the blood\n\nsugar level. Dr. Smith further testified that alcohol, though initially raising the blood\nsugar level, would eventually lower the level. He stated that persons suffering from\n\nhypoglycemia would crave alcohol to get a “quick fuel supply.” Dr. Smith stated as\n\nfollows:\n              There’s [sic] two symptoms a person feels. One is the affect\n              of the low sugar itself. And the second is the affect of the\n              adrenaline. The affect of the low sugar itself may be the\n              feeling of confusion. A feeling like spaciness, like things aren’t\n              working well, like poor focus, poor concentration, poor\n              memory. Then the affect of the adrenaline includes increased\n              heart rate, increased breathing rate, increased blood pressure,\n              increase [sic] muscular activity with shakiness. A sense of\n              impending doom. A sense of anxiety. A sense of irritability.\n              Even some paranoia.\n\n\n              Dr. Smith testified that stress, the petitioner’s alcohol and chemical\n\ndependency, and the petitioner’s diet of “fast food type foods with a very heavy intake\n\nof Coca-Cola, regular Coca-Cola” caused the petitioner’s hypoglycemic condition. Dr.\n\nSmith believed that the petitioner inherited the brain chemistry which fostered his\n\nalcohol and chemical addiction. Dr. Smith stated that the petitioner informed him that\n\nhe experienced alcohol induced blackouts. Dr. Smith also stated that the summary of\n\nthe trial transcript indicated that other witnesses testified about the petitioner’s\n\nblackouts. Dr. Smith testified that the general opinion in his profession is that alcohol\nreleases the inhibition against violent rageful behavior rather than producing that type of\n\nbehavior. Dr. Smith testified that for people who suffer from intermittent explosive\n\ndisorder, the addition of alcohol and drug addiction “would be like pouring gasoline on a\nfire.” In addition, Dr. Smith testified that alcohol and cocaine use increases the\n\nlikelihood of the severity of hypoglycemic reactions.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Smith testified that alcohol contributes to lowering the serotonin level\n\nover time, which causes irritable and suspicious feelings, and an inability to inhibit\n\nbehavior. Dr. Smith testified that a combination of alcohol abuse, low serotonin,\n\nhypoglycemia and intermittent explosive disorder, such as he believed was present in\nthe petitioner, would prevent a person under severe emotional stress from controlling\n\nhis behavior. Dr. Smith stated that all these conditions are treatable and that treating\n\nthem would reduce the risk of uncontrollable behavior. Dr. Smith agreed with Dr.\n\n                                              9\n\fAuble’s diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder and stated that he believed the\n\npetitioner has antisocial personality disorder as well.\n\n\n\n               In response to a question about what might have triggered the petitioner’s\n\nviolent behavior on the night of the crime, Dr. Smith stated:\n\n               I can tell you what I believe. I believe that as a child [the\n               petitioner] had something very, very horrible happen to him in\n               regards to an older woman. His mother says that she will take\n               whatever it was to her grave and will not talk about it. And\n               because of dissociation, [the petitioner] cannot ever know what\n               it was. And that whatever triggered his violent, uncontrollable\n               activity that night, was triggered by something that related to\n               an older woman and that particular situation. And I may never\n               know and you may never know. And [the petitioner] certainly\n               wouldn’t know. But, I believe it happened. And I believe it\n               based on a lot of literature and based on a training program\n               that I went to in New Orleans at River Oaks Hospital. That this\n               type of thing happens . . . . It’s more than a guess. It’s an\n               educated summary of all the materials. If I took just one part\n               of it, no I couldn’t, but taking the big picture of what his mother\n               said, of his history, of his reactivity to women. The big picture\n               would suggest that this is what happened to him. And that he\n               was triggered into a dissociative state where he had absolute\n               loss of control that his functional self wasn’t there. All he was\n               was a reactive self.\n\nDr. Smith further testified that a person in a dissociative state could premeditate, i.e.,\n\nact “very clever . . . because it is survival.”\n\n\n\n               Dr. Smith stated that although he reviewed the summary of the transcript\n\nprepared by post-conviction counsel, he did not ask the petitioner any questions about\n\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding the crime. Dr. Smith testified that it was not\nnecessary to question the petitioner on this because the summary of the transcript\n\nnoted that the petitioner had no recollection of the events. He testified that in addition,\n\nthe only report of the petitioner’s intoxication on the night of the murder came from the\npetitioner himself. He said that the petitioner told him that he started drinking between\n\n3:00 and 5:00 p.m. and consumed two pints of whiskey. Dr. Smith testified that\n\nalthough the petitioner could not recall the specific events of that night, the petitioner\n\ntold him that he would normally ingest two Valium pills and several lines of cocaine and\nsmoke two to three marijuana cigarettes.\n\n\n\n               Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a psychiatry professor and the director of child and\nadolescent psychiatry at Vanderbilt University, testified that he interviewed the\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fpetitioner four or five times for a total of eleven hours. Dr. Nurcombe said he also\n\nreviewed the petitioner’s social history; a summary of the trial transcript; and reports\n\nfrom Drs. Rossby, Smith and Auble during his evaluation. Dr. Nurcombe said he did\nnot test the petitioner. Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner suffered from\n\nintermittent explosive disorder, polysubstance abuse, paranoid personality disorder,\n\nhypoglycemia and a low serotonin level. He testified that ninety-nine percent of the\nsame sex, race and age population as the petitioner have higher serotonin levels than\n\nthe petitioner. Dr. Nurcombe stated that the combination of these factors would cause\n\nthe petitioner to have difficulty controlling violent impulses. According to Dr. Nurcombe,\nthe petitioner’s capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was\n\nimpaired at the time of the offense in this case.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that research in this field since the early 1980s has\n\ndemonstrated that low serotonin levels are associated with violent impulsive behavior.\n\nHe said the research further demonstrates that recidivist offenders of violent crimes\n\ntend to have a lower serotonin level than do nonrecidivist offenders. He said that a\n\ncombination of hypoglycemia and low serotonin levels seems to be a possible indicator\n\nof recidivism. Dr. Nurcombe stated that alcohol consumption and intermittent explosive\n\ndisorder are also factors.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that individuals have certain memories that are\n\nreactivated by situations or events that remind the individual of terrifying or emotionally\n\narousing experiences from the past. He said the person will not usually remember the\npast event, but when the emotion from the past event is triggered by something in the\n\npresent, not necessarily recognized by the person, an automatic discharge of behavior,\n\nfeeling and emotion occurs. He testified that serotonin helps the individual control\nthese automatic discharges. According to Dr. Nurcombe, lower serotonin levels, like\n\nthe petitioner has, severely impair the ability to control the automatic discharges of\n\nemotion or behavior. Dr. Nurcombe stated that after reviewing the petitioner’s social\n\nhistory prepared by Ms. Ottinger, he found the following factors relevant with regard to\nthe generation of emotional memory in the petitioner:\n\n              The social history . . . did indicate a considerable degree of\n              emotional and physical abuse . . . . First of all [the petitioner]\n              was the ninth of eleven children. He was born . . . into a family\n\n                                             11\n\f              which was identified, I think, ethnically with the Cajun group in\n              Louisiana. His family was very poor. Early in their marriage\n              [the petitioner’s] parents are said to have had a turbulent\n              marriage. Although by the time he was born, this was less\n              apparent.     The parents, however, were described as\n              disengaged from each other. This was a family in which\n              affection was not expressed. And, in fact, the only emotion\n              that was expressed, and in fact, encouraged to be expressed\n              was fighting between the siblings. By the time [the petitioner]\n              was born, his mother left much of the child rearing and child\n              care to the older daughters in the family . . . . [The petitioner]\n              suffered from early childhood to the age of 21 with severe\n              problem [sic] of urinary incontinence, which involved both\n              daytime and nighttime incontinence . . . . The mother is said to\n              have been punitive towards him for this. The other siblings\n              humiliated him. His nickname at home was “piss-bug.” . . . In\n              fact, from the very first day of school he remembers being\n              separated from the classroom for having been incontinent and\n              being made to stand in a corner. And this happened frequently\n              when he was at school. And for other children rejecting him or\n              humiliating him on these grounds . . . . [The petitioner] was\n              subject from middle childhood, onward, to attacks of rage,\n              which became extremely severe by the age of 11 to 12 years.\n              As a result of his attacks of rage, of impulsive running away\n              from school, he was suspended, expelled, in fact, from two\n              schools. And had very significant difficulties in the third and\n              final school that he attended. Rage, assaults on teachers,\n              impulsive running away, provocation towards other children,\n              together with the problem of enuresis indicated that by the time\n              he reached grade five he was in serious difficulties,\n              emotionally.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner’s social history suggests that he\n\nhad low serotonin levels as a child. Dr. Nurcombe discussed the physical abuse the\n\npetitioner suffered from his parents, and he said it is significant that the petitioner has\nno memory of his mother’s physical abuse toward him. Dr. Nurcombe stated that the\n\nevidence of abuse by the petitioner’s mother was gathered from the petitioner’s\n\nsiblings. Dr. Nurcombe believed that the petitioner repressed these memories. Dr.\nNurcombe also considered significant two school reports that described the petitioner\n\nas being in a “trance” and “out of touch at times.” According to Dr. Nurcombe, these\n\nreports are consistent with a dissociative tendency.\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner abused alcohol in an effort to\n\novercome his anger toward his wives. Dr. Nurcombe explained that the more the\n\npetitioner drank, the more irritable and explosive he became because his serotonin\nlevels would eventually drop even further. Dr. Nurcombe stated that low serotonin,\n\naggravated by alcohol abuse, disinhibits and enables the release of repressed\n\nemotional memories. Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner’s hypoglycemia, in\n\n                                             12\n\fconnection with the low serotonin, intermittent explosive disorder and alcohol abuse,\n\nwould increase the petitioner’s lack of control.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that he would not necessarily have described the\n\npetitioner’s condition in the same way as Dr. Nichols. Dr. Nurcombe stated that the\n\npetitioner was in a “fugue state,” wherein the petitioner was in a continuing impulsive\nviolent rage triggered by a momentary experience. When asked whether the petitioner\n\nwould have the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, Dr.\n\nNurcombe initially responded that the petitioner’s ability to do so would be significantly\nimpaired. Upon further questioning, he stated that assuming the petitioner was\n\nintoxicated, hypoglycemic, and experiencing a low serotonin level and intermittent\n\nexplosive disorder triggered by some event, the petitioner’s ability would be so\nsignificantly impaired as to prevent the petitioner from conforming his conduct to the\n\nrequirements of the law.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that although the petitioner did not remember\n\ncommitting the murder, the petitioner did remember that he drank and took drugs earlier\n\nthat evening. Dr. Nurcombe also stated that the petitioner was convicted in Louisiana\n\nof a sexual offense about which he was able to remember the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the offense. Dr. Nurcombe testified that the ingestion of drugs and alcohol\nwere the main factors that triggered the event in the present case. Dr. Nurcombe\n\nadmitted that he could not identify any emotional trigger, but he added that the trigger\n\ncould be something minor that would not necessarily be identified by anyone else.\n\n\n              When asked by the court how an explosive disorder can be justified when\n\nthere was evidence of planning in this case, Dr. Nurcombe explained that because the\npetitioner drank so heavily and blacked out, something likely occurred during this\n\nintoxicated state to trigger the petitioner’s emotional memories. According to Dr.\n\nNurcombe, this in turn led the petitioner to act out his revenge fantasies against\n\nwomen. Dr. Nurcombe stated that although the petitioner did not inform him of any\nrevenge fantasies toward women because he is not consciously aware of them, the\n\npetitioner did describe revenge fantasies and violent reactions against people in prison\n\nwho had slighted or humiliated him. Dr. Nurcombe explained that there is some sense\n\n                                            13\n\fof primitive self-protective behavior when a person is in a “fugue state” and that the\n\nperson’s behavior in a “fugue state” is more automatic and outside conscious\n\nawareness. Finally, Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner’s “plain meanness” would\nbe attributable to his mental disorders.\n\n\n\n              James Ball testified that he and Dwight Duncan were appointed to\nrepresent the petitioner after the trial court relieved the Office of the Public Defender.\n\nMr. Ball testified that he had been practicing law since 1961 and estimated that he had\n\nbeen involved in thousands of criminal cases, including several capital cases. Mr. Ball\ntestified that he assumed the case was “pretty much worked up” when he took it over\n\nbecause the capital defense team at the Public Defender’s Office had the case for\n\nabout thirteen months. Mr. Ball testified that the court appointed him to the case around\nJuly 9, 1990. He said that the trial was originally scheduled to start on September 10,\n\n1990, but they obtained a continuance until September 24, 1990. Mr. Ball further\n\ntestified that Mr. Duncan was not available to assist him until late August.\n\n\n\n              Mr. Ball testified that he did not recall whether he was familiar with the\n\nfiling of ex parte motions for expert services in capital cases. He said that Dr. Nichols\n\nevaluated the petitioner while the public defender represented him. Mr. Ball testified\n\nthat his first contact with Dr. Nichols was sometime in September and that Dr. Nichols\nsuggested the possibility that the petitioner suffered from an organic brain impairment,\n\nwhich severely limited his ability to control his impulses when angry. Mr. Ball testified\n\nthat Mr. Duncan filed a motion for additional support services on September 29, 1990,\nupon receiving a letter from Dr. Nichols on September 28, 1990, explaining that the\n\npetitioner might be suffering from an organic brain disorder. Mr. Ball testified that they\n\nwanted an M.R.I. and a Q-beam performed on the petitioner. He said that they filed the\nmotion during the guilt phase of trial, and the trial court denied it.\n\n\n\n              Mr. Ball testified that he received discovery from the state but that he did\n\nnot receive the police reports from the case. Mr. Ball also testified that both Mr. Duncan\nand the public defender requested the petitioner’s school records from Louisiana but\n\nnever received them. Mr. Ball testified that he personally traveled to Louisiana and met\n\nwith the petitioner’s family for several hours but that they were not very cooperative. He\n\n                                              14\n\fsaid he asked to talk to the petitioner’s mother, but the family refused because they did\n\nnot want her to be involved. Mr. Ball testified that although he attempted to have the\n\nentire family testify during the sentencing phase, only two of the petitioner’s brothers\nappeared. Mr. Ball said he did not meet with any of the petitioner’s former teachers or\n\nprincipals. However, he said he knew that the petitioner had a troubled childhood,\n\nincluding problems in school. Mr. Ball said that from conversations with the petitioner\nand some of his acquaintances, he discovered that the petitioner abused drugs and\n\nalcohol. He said he reviewed the petitioner’s social history prepared for the post-\n\nconviction hearing and testified that the information would have been helpful to the\ndefense at trial. However, he stated that during sentencing, testimony revealed facts\n\nabout the petitioner’s childhood and alcohol and drug abuse, as well as his possible\n\nneurological problems.\n\n\n              Mr. Ball testified that he met with the petitioner often before trial and was\n\nable to carry on intelligent conversations about the proof and available defenses. He\n\nsaid he believed that the petitioner was competent to assist in his defense. Mr. Ball\n\nsaid he never considered the petitioner to be out of touch with reality during the trial.\n\nHe said he knew that the petitioner was taking antipsychotic drugs while in jail. He\n\nstated that the most damaging evidence against the petitioner at trial was\n\ncircumstantial: the fingerprints at the scene and the bite marks on the victim. Mr. Ball\nsaid that the state apparently lost one of the fingerprints taken from the screen in front\n\nof the victim’s house. Mr. Ball testified that he and Mr. Duncan defended on the merits\n\nof the case, meaning they made the state prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt\nbecause “that’s what [he] thought needed to be done.” Mr. Ball stated that the\n\npetitioner had been to the victim’s residence before because he was a friend of her\n\ngrandson. He said that he and Mr. Duncan filed a motion on August 29, 1990, for\nexpert services to assist in rebutting the state’s experts on the fingerprints, the bite\n\nmarks, and the chipping hammer, but the motion was denied. Mr. Ball testified that\n\nthey fully discussed the case with the petitioner and that the petitioner did not object to\n\nthe trial strategy. Mr. Ball testified that the petitioner was not in favor of an insanity\ndefense. He said the decision to forgo an insanity defense was made before Dr.\n\nNichols sent him the letter suggesting that more testing might be helpful. Mr. Ball\n\ntestified that Dr. Nichols examined the petitioner before trial and that Dr. Nichols stated\n\n                                              15\n\fthat he believed the petitioner was competent and legally sane at the time of the\n\noffense.\n\n\n\n              Judge James C. Beasley, Jr., former Assistant District Attorney General,\n\ntestified that he helped prosecute the petitioner’s case. Judge Beasley testified that he\n\ngave defense counsel a copy of his entire file when they were appointed to represent\nthe petitioner. Judge Beasley testified that this was not his normal procedure but\n\nbecause petitioner’s counsel were appointed after the public defender was relieved\n\nprior to trial, he gave new counsel everything he had, except possibly the police reports.\nJudge Beasley recounted the mitigation proof presented by the defense, including the\n\npetitioner’s own testimony, as follows:\n\n                       It was -- I mean, I think you would have to be very cold\n              not to have been moved by it. Even though I was the\n              prosecutor and even though I was seeking the death penalty,\n              I felt it was moving testimony. And I think I was concerned,\n              especially when the jury stayed out in the sentencing phase for\n              five or six hours, two or three times longer than they had in the\n              guilt phase. It concerned me greatly that they may be being\n              swayed by this proof that he had put on.\n\n\n\n              Judge Beasley testified that the state questioned the petitioner on cross-\n\nexamination about the events on the night of the murder but that the petitioner testified\nthat he did not recall anything about the offense. Judge Beasley testified that the jury\n\nappeared to be very emotional when they returned with their verdict. Judge Beasley\n\ntestified that even if the defense had offered expert testimony during the guilt phase\nsuggesting that the crime was impulsive, he still would have argued to the jury that the\n\npetitioner planned his actions and acted with premeditation.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Daniel A. Martell, a forensic neuropsychologist, testified that forensic\n\nneuropsychology encompasses the study of brain damage and its effects on human\n\nbehavior as it relates to the law. Dr. Martell stated that before his two-day evaluation of\n\nthe petitioner, he reviewed the post-conviction testimony of the petitioner’s experts, the\npetitioner’s prison records, the police reports, and selected portions of the trial transcript\n\nand the medical records of the petitioner’s mother. Dr. Martell said he interviewed the\n\npetitioner and administered several tests, including memory tests; a language test; a\npsychological disassociation test; a battery of tests to detect malingering; tests\n\n\n                                             16\n\fmeasuring psychopathy, antisocial behaviors and substance abuse; and the MMPI\n\npsychological personality test.\n\n\n\n             Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner has low serotonin and\n\nhypoglycemia. However, he also testified that:\n\n             the research that attempted to link low serotonin to violent\n             behavior I think is -- has been over represented to the Court,\n             the strength of that association. A careful reading of the\n             literature indicates that it’s not tied to violent behavior per se,\n             but rather is tied to impulsive behavior, of which violence or\n             aggression is sometimes a subset.\n\n                   A careful examination of the trial record indicates that\n             Mr. Cazes’s behavior in conducting the crime was not\n             impulsive. And the finding from the research is that low\n             serotonin is related to impulsive criminal offending.\n\n                     In fact, when you look at the criteria for the research\n              groups, people were determined not to be impulsive if, number\n              one, they knew the victim, which Mr. Cazes did in this case;\n              and number two, if there was evidence of premeditation in the\n              conduct of the violent crime. And I believe a reading of the\n              record indicates that there was that level of premeditation, of\n              non-impulsive, planned, goal-oriented behavior, and I’m\n              prepared to give the Court my impression from reading the trial\n              record of evidence of that lack of impulsivity.\n\n              ....\n\n                     The first issue is the fact that he selected a victim that\n              was known to him, which, as I mentioned from the research\n              studies, would be rule-out [sic] for impulsivity.\n\n                      In addition, upon arriving at her residence, he obtained\n              a chipping hammer, which I understand to be a welder’s tool,\n              from his car, which he used both in attempting to gain entry to\n              her residence as well as in the assault on Ms. Skinner. The\n              fact that he had the foresight to plan ahead and obtain this tool\n              to help him indicates that he was not behaving in an impulsive\n              way, but rather in a goal-oriented way. He appreciated the\n              nature and consequences of what he wanted to do, i.e., obtain\n              entry into her locked house and gain access to her, and it also\n              indicates an ability to control his behavior. He didn’t go\n              rushing out of his car and banging on the door or smashing out\n              the window. He was careful in taking a tool with him to\n              perpetrate the crime.\n                      The fact that he unscrewed the light bulb illuminating\n              the backyard is further indication that he knew what he was\n              doing or what he wanted to do was wrong and that he wanted\n              to reduce his risk of detection by reducing the illumination in\n              that situation. So it’s purposeful behavior directed at avoiding\n              detection of his behavior. Again, that is not impulsive. He\n              didn’t go cracking at the door and smashing out the window\n              until he reduced his risk.\n\n                     There’s evidence at the back door of evidence of trying\n              to -- of pry marks to open that door. Failing . . . for some\n              reason at being able to do that, whether it was making too\n              much noise or he couldn’t get the door open, I don’t know, but\n\n                                             17\n\ffor some reason he abandoned that effort, he then was able to\nplan an alternative strategy. He was able to shift from trying to\ngain entry through the back of the house and go around to the\nfront of the house, where he may have attempted to gain entry\nthrough the front door, which had an iron gate on it, and\nultimately selected an accessible window as his mode of entry.\n\n       The ability to shift your behavior, to start in on one plan\nof attack, meet an impediment and then have the problem\nsolving ability to avoid that and go around and find another\nway to get in again is evidence that it’s not impulsive. This is\nfocused, goal-oriented behavior, aimed at obtaining a specific\nreward; that is, getting access into her secured home and\ngaining access to her.\n       Even upon selecting the window he still had to deal with\nthe screens that had been installed there and had to remove\nthe screens. Again his dogged pursuit of his goal of gaining\nentry into the house at whatever means necessary, mangling\nthe screen, breaking out the window, all of these things are not\nimpulsive, but instead are planned, focused, goal-oriented\nbehaviors.\n\n       Once inside the house, the evidence indicates that he\ncentered his behavior on the victim’s bedroom where she was.\nHe is not elsewhere in the house breaking into things.\nEverything is focused where the scene of the sexual assault\ntakes place.\n\n       Upon encountering Ms. Skinner, he subdued her with\nblows to her head and body with the chipping hammer. This\nwas to render her compliant to his wishes, to reduce her ability\nto call the police or to scream or to call for help. This is\nbehavior that’s very characteristic of sexual homicide offenders\nas they have been profiled by the FBI’s Behavioral Science\nUnit and as they’ve published about the behavior of individuals\nwho do this. This is very typical behavior of sexual homicide\noffenders to use this kind of blitz attack on the victim to subdue\nthem and to get them to cooperate with their wishes.\n       Again, this is not impulsive behavior. This is purposeful,\ngoal-directed behavior in order to permit him to accomplish the\nsexual act that he has come there to do.\n\n       In addition, after subduing her, he engages in sexual\nbehaviors that are particularly pleasing to him, including biting\nthe victim in certain places and posing her body in sexual\npositions that he found arousing and that were his favorite\npositions to do that. Again, this is practiced and purposeful\nbehavior for his own sexual gratification, not impulsive\nbehavior driven by some biochemical imbalance.\n       Following the assault, the evidence indicates that he\nransacked her bedroom, pulling things out of the drawers,\nstaging the crime scene to perhaps appear as if a robbery had\noccurred. Again, this kind of staging of the crime scene is not\nimpulsive behavior, but rather is purposeful, goal-directed\nbehavior, intended to misdirect investigators who come on to\nthe scene and make them think that there was some other goal\nin mind during the course of the assault.\n\n        This type of forensic behavioral analysis to me indicates\nthat this was not an impulsive crime, but rather was purposeful,\nfocused, goal-directed, planned behavior, and that would be\ninconsistent with the research literature on glucose metabolism\n\n                               18\n\f              and low serotonin that suggests that some of these offenders\n              will engage in aggressive behavior that is impulsive.\n\n\n              Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner met the criteria for conduct disorder\n\nin childhood and antisocial personality behavior as an adult, but he testified that he\ndisagreed with the diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder because this disorder is\n\ncharacterized by sudden, unexpected rage attacks that must occur outside the context\n\nof other specific mental disorders, including intoxication. Dr. Martell testified that\naccording to the petitioner’s history, the petitioner’s rage occurred only when he was\n\nintoxicated. Dr. Martell also disagreed that the crime was committed while the\n\npetitioner was in a dissociative mental state. He said that during his evaluation of the\npetitioner, the petitioner informed him that he had about twenty blackout spells after\n\nwhich he would not remember anything and that they all occurred while he was abusing\n\neither drugs or alcohol. According to Dr. Martell, the diagnosis of a dissociative\ndisorder cannot be made if the disorder only occurs during a state of intoxication. Dr.\n\nMartell said that in addition, the petitioner scored below the cutoff for dissociation on the\n\ntest he administered. Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner never engaged in a violent\n\nact during any of the other blackouts he experienced and that the petitioner did not\n\nclaim to have amnesia during previous violent acts. Dr. Martell said that this indicates\nthat the petitioner was not in a dissociative state at the time of the crime.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Martell testified that contrary to Dr. Auble’s findings, he did not find\nany evidence of neuropsychological impairment. Dr. Martell opined that the petitioner\n\nwas not giving his best efforts on the neuropsychological tests administered by Dr.\n\nAuble. Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner exaggerated his responses on some of\nthe personality tests administered by Dr. Auble, which could have caused her to\n\nmisinterpret the results. Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner was “emotionally labile,\n\nthat he’s demanding, that he can be hostile and irritable and evasive and suspicious\n\nand distrustful.”\n\n\n              Dr. Martell testified that he reviewed Dr. Nichols’ recommendation that the\n\npetitioner undergo further neurological evaluation and stated that even if further\nevaluation had been performed before trial, the results would not have supported an\n\n\n                                             19\n\finsanity defense. Dr. Martell stated:\n\n                     I think even if it had led to the full examination that has\n              been done in the last year or two, because of the reasons I’ve\n              outlined for the Court this morning, none of these factors would\n              have been relevant to his mental state.\n\n                     Serotonin doesn’t matter because the crime was not\n              impulsive. He doesn’t meet criteria for intermittent explosive\n              disorder or dissociation. He is an antisocial character. And\n              even if this additional testing were done, we’d be at the same\n              point that we are today, that it wouldn’t support it.\n\n                     Dr. Nichols was the defense doctor, and he himself felt\n              that he was not insane. He thought it would be nice to know\n              more about his neuropsychological status, but even if we had\n              pursued that at that -- if the Court had pursued that or the\n              defense had pursued that at the time and it yielded the findings\n              that we have today, it still wouldn’t have contributed to his\n              defense or to mitigation evidence.\n\n\n              Dr. Martell admitted that he used his own method instead of an official\n\ncomputer program from National Computer Systems in scoring some of the tests\nadministered to the petitioner. Dr. Martell also admitted that more than one published\n\nauthority exists regarding the results of some of the psychological tests administered.\n\nThe petitioner’s attorney attempted to discredit Dr. Martell’s conclusions. For example,\n\nafter citing to one of the authorities upon which Dr. Martell relied that stated that a\n\ndisorganized crime scene suggests an impulsive crime, the attorney asked Dr. Martell\nhow he concluded that the petitioner acted with purpose when the victim’s bedroom\n\nwas in such disarray. Dr. Martell supported his conclusion with the fact that the\n\npetitioner tried to deter detection by unscrewing the light bulb above the back door and\nby trying to pry the door open rather than kicking it open. Dr. Martell explained that the\n\npetitioner may have left the crime scene in disarray to mislead the police about the\n\npurpose of the crime. Regarding the petitioner’s low serotonin level, alcohol abuse, and\nhypoglycemia, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n              ATTORNEY: So those three factors in combination are good\n              predictors of the likelihood of violent impulsive behavior?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: Of impulsive violent behavior, that’s correct.\n\n              ATTORNEY: That’s correct. And Mr. Cazes has all three of\n              those factors in evidence, does he not?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: He has the factors, but in committing this\n              crime he was not impulsive.\n\n              ATTORNEY: Well, again that goes to your definition of impulsivity.\n\n              ....\n\n                                             20\n\f              DR. MARTELL: This is based on an analysis of his behavior\n              as he conducted the crimes.\n              ATTORNEY: According to your notion of impulsivity?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: It is my opinion. That’s correct.\n\nRegarding the petitioner’s treatment with Prozac while in prison, the following colloquy\noccurred:\n\n              ATTORNEY: And you asked him about how it had affected him,\n              correct?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: I did.\n\n              ATTORNEY: And he responded that it had calmed him down?\n              DR. MARTELL: He did.\n\n              ATTORNEY: Isn’t that in itself corroborative of the behavioral effects\n              of low serotonin in Mr. Cazes?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: No, it is not, and let me tell you why. Mr.\n              Cazes, during the period of time when he was being treated\n              with Prozac, he had historically refused any treatment or\n              contact until these proceedings and Dr. Nurcombe’s diagnosis\n              and the serotonin findings, at which time he did agree to take\n              the Prozac. And he reports he felt better, and there is actually\n              a note in the chart that said there was some improvement in\n              his behavior.\n\n                 However, at the same time that he was taking the Prozac\n              he had at least two incidents where he flung feces on\n              correctional officers during the time when he is being treated.\n              And then he later refused to take the medication and continued\n              to have this kind of behavior, not necessarily the throwing\n              feces, but acting out to the point where he had to be put in the\n              administrative segregation.\n                 And it’s also a consistent pattern with his prior disciplinary\n              history in the institution. So that to me shows that there’s no\n              correlation between the Prozac treatment and his impulsive\n              acting-out kind of behavior. I think it reflects antisocial\n              personality, not serotonin depletion.\n              COURT: You’re saying he felt better but he didn’t act any better?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: That’s correct, sir.\n              Dr. Auble was recalled and testified that she and Dr. Martell disagreed on\n\nwhether the petitioner had intermittent explosive disorder, whether impulsive behavior\n\ncan be purposeful and whether evidence of low serotonin, hypoglycemia and the\n\nfindings in the petitioner’s social history are significant mitigating factors. Dr. Auble\ntestified that the petitioner could have acted “purposefully in the grip of an emotional\n\nimpulse,” similar to the actions of people with impulse control disorders like pyromania,\n\nkleptomania and pathological gambling. According to Dr. Auble, the crime in this case\nwas the product of an emotional impulse with low serotonin, intoxication and\n\n\n                                             21\n\fhypoglycemia contributing to impair the petitioner’s inhibition of the emotional impulse.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Auble could not describe or identify any triggering event that caused\nthe petitioner to retreat to this emotional state. She testified that she and Dr. Martell\n\nalso disagreed about what personality disorder the petitioner has. She said Dr. Martell\n\nbelieves the petitioner has antisocial personality disorder, whereas she believes he has\nintermittent explosive disorder. Dr. Auble testified that the petitioner’s aggressive\n\noutbursts did not occur only when the petitioner was intoxicated. She also testified that\n\nthe petitioner could have been in a dissociative state while intoxicated. However, Dr.\nAuble said she could not identify any time during which the petitioner claimed to\n\nblackout while not intoxicated. After reviewing some of the physical exhibits from the\n\noriginal trial, Dr. Auble testified that the verbal description of the crime scene she\nreceived was sufficient for her to form an opinion about the impulsive nature of the\n\ncrime without having viewed the exhibits. Based upon the foregoing proof, the trial\n\ncourt denied the post-conviction petition.\n\n\n\n              Under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act in effect at the time the\n\npetitioner filed his petition, the petitioner has the burden of proving the allegations in his\n\npetition by a preponderance of the evidence. McBee v. State, 655 S.W.2d 191, 195\n\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1983). The trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law in\npost-conviction cases are conclusive on appeal unless the appellate court finds that the\n\nevidence preponderates against the findings. Black v. State, 794 S.W.2d 752, 755\n\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1990); Butler v. State, 789 S.W.2d 898, 899 (Tenn. 1990).\nFurthermore, this court may not reweigh or reevaluate the evidence or substitute its\n\ninferences for those drawn by the trial court. Black, 794 S.W.2d at 755. This includes\n\ngiving deference to the trial court concerning witness credibility. Id.\n\n\n\n                           I. RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT\n\n              The petitioner contends that the trial judge conducting the post-conviction\n\nevidentiary hearing erred by denying the petitioner’s motions to recuse the judge and to\nhave the case reassigned to the division of the trial court to which it was originally\n\nassigned. The state contends that the issues are not properly before this court\n\nbecause they have been previously determined against the petitioner. Alternatively, the\n\n                                             22\n\fstate contends that the trial court properly denied the petitioner’s motions.\n\n\n\n              Initially, we address the state’s contention that the issues were previously\ndetermined against the petitioner. The state claims that the law of the case doctrine\n\nprecludes reconsideration of these issues on direct appeal because the petitioner\n\npreviously sought and was denied extraordinary review of these issues pursuant to\nT.R.A.P. 10. The grant of a T.R.A.P. 10 application is conditioned upon a showing by\n\nthe appellant that “the lower court has so far departed from the accepted and usual\n\ncourse of judicial proceedings as to require immediate review” or that immediate review\nis necessary for complete determination of the action on appeal. If these requirements\n\nare not met, the application for permission to appeal is denied. However, this court\n\ndoes not necessarily reach the merits of the particular claims raised when it denies a\nT.R.A.P. 10 application. Instead, the court decides whether the claims raised must be\n\naddressed in an interlocutory or extraordinary fashion rather than subsequently on\n\ndirect appeal. In the present case, the court concluded that immediate, interlocutory\n\nreview was not necessary. Although the court’s order refers to the particular issues\n\nraised, the court did not fully address the merits of the underlying claims. Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude that these issues were not previously addressed and are now properly\n\nbefore us. See, e.g., State v. Ruane, 912 S.W.2d 766, 773-77 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995)\n\n(addressing the merits on direct appeal even though the appellant’s T.R.A.P. 10\napplication was denied and the order of denial referred to the underlying issue raised).\n\n\n\n                                  A. Motion to Recuse\n              The petitioner contends that because the trial court judge was employed\n\nby the Office of the District Attorney General during the prosecution of the petitioner on\n\nan earlier, separate matter, thereby giving the appearance of partiality, the judge should\nhave recused himself. The state contends that the trial court did not err by denying the\n\npetitioner’s motion. We note that the trial court has discretion in determining whether to\n\ngrant a motion to recuse. The court’s decision will not be reversed on appeal unless\n\nthe face of the record reveals clear abuse. State v. Hines, 919 S.W.2d 573, 578 (Tenn.\n\n1995).\n\n\n\n              Canon 3(E)(1), Rule 10, Tenn. Sup. Ct. R., provides as follows:\n\n                                            23\n\f              A judge shall disqualify himself . . . in a proceeding in which\n              the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\n              including but not limited to instances where:\n\n              (a) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a\n              party or a party’s lawyer, or personal knowledge of disputed\n              evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;\n\n              (b) the judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy,\n              or a lawyer with whom the judge previously practiced law\n              served during such association as a lawyer concerning the\n              matter, or the judge has been a material witness concerning it.\n\nThe commentary to this section provides:\n              A lawyer in a government agency does not ordinarily have an\n              association with other lawyers employed by that agency within\n              the meaning of Section E(1)(b); a judge formerly employed by\n              a government agency, however, should disqualify himself . . .\n\n              in a proceeding if the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be\n              questioned because of such association.\n\n\n\n              We hold that the petitioner has not demonstrated that the trial court\nabused its discretion in denying the motion to recuse. The record reflects that although\n\nthe trial judge was present in the courtroom during a hearing in a previous proceeding\n\ninvolving the petitioner, the judge stated that he merely received a copy of a motion\n\nfiled by defense counsel because the prosecutor handling the matter was unavailable at\n\nthe time. While the judge’s name appears on the cover of the transcript in the earlier\nproceeding, no other mention of the judge’s participation in the earlier proceeding\n\nexists. Moreover, the judge stated that he did not remember or know anything about\n\nthe petitioner or his cases.\n\n\n              Nothing in the record before us suggests that the trial judge’s impartiality\n\ncould reasonably be questioned. The judge sufficiently explained why his name\nappeared on the cover of the transcript from the earlier proceeding involving the\n\npetitioner. Although the petitioner claims that the trial court’s bias against him is\n\nevidenced by the denial of the petitioner’s claims, adverse rulings by a court are\n\ngenerally insufficient grounds to establish bias. Alley v. State, 882 S.W.2d 810, 820\n\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1994). The record is devoid of any suggestion that the trial judge\n\ndemonstrated antagonism toward the petitioner or expressed any opinion about the\n\nmerits of the proceeding before the hearing. See Id. at 821-22.\n\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f                                  B. Motion to Reassign\n\n              The petitioner contends that his petition was transferred from one division\n\nof the trial court to another in violation of local court rules and that the trial court should\nhave granted his motion to reassign the petition to the court in which it was originally\n\nfiled. The state contends that the trial court properly denied the motion.\n\n\n\n              Initially, we note that some discrepancy exists as to which court the\n\npetition was originally assigned. The petitioner suggests that the petition was originally\n\nassigned to Division IX of the Shelby County Criminal Court. However, the court\nrecords reflect that the petition was filed in Division VII but that the trial judge in Division\n\nVII had a conflict with the petitioner and asked Judge Craft of Division VIII to hear the\n\nmatter. The record shows that Judge Craft agreed, and the petition was heard in\nDivision VIII, the same division in which the original trial was conducted. However, the\n\ntrial judge who presided over the trial in Division VIII retired before the petitioner filed\n\nthe present petition.\n\n\n\n              Rule 4.03 of the Shelby County Criminal Court Rules requires that a\n\nwritten order of transfer be filed to transfer a case from one division to another. The\n\nrecord in the present case contains no written order of transfer. However, Rule 4.05\n\nprovides that “[t]he judges may transfer cases among themselves by mutual consent”\nwithout the consent of the parties or counsel. Our reading of the record shows that this\n\nis what occurred in the present case. Obviously, the better practice would have been\n\nfor a written order to have been filed. However, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate\nthat he was prejudiced by the lack of a written order. See T.R.A.P. 36(b).\n\n\n\n                     II. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n              The petitioner contends that his trial attorneys were ineffective at both the\n\nguilt and sentencing phases of the trial. Specifically, the petitioner argues that his\n\nattorneys failed to conduct an adequate investigation into his background, including his\n\nmental and physical conditions. He argues that the attorneys’ deficient performance\nprecluded the jury from considering possible defenses during the guilt phase and\n\nimportant mitigating evidence during sentencing. The state contends that the petitioner\n\nreceived the effective assistance of counsel.\n\n                                              25\n\f              Under the Sixth Amendment, when a claim of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel is made, the burden is upon the petitioner to show (1) that counsel’s\n\nperformance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial in terms of\nrendering a reasonable probability that the result of the trial was unreliable or the\n\nproceedings fundamentally unfair. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.\n\nCt. 2052, 2064 (1984); see Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 368-72, 113 S. Ct. 838,\n842-44 (1993). The Strickland standard has been applied to the right to counsel under\n\nArticle I, Section 9, of the Tennessee Constitution. State v. Melson, 772 S.W.2d 417,\n\n419 n. 2 (Tenn. 1989).\n\n\n              In Baxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930, 936 (Tenn. 1975), our supreme court\n\ndecided that attorneys should be held to the general standard of whether the services\nrendered were within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal\n\ncases. Further, the court stated that the range of competence was to be measured by\n\nthe duties and criteria set forth in Beasley v. United States, 491 F.2d 687, 696 (6th Cir.\n\n1974) and United States v. DeCoster, 487 F.2d 1197, 1202-04 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Also,\n\nin reviewing counsel’s conduct, a “fair assessment of attorney performance requires\n\nthat every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct\n\nthe circumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from\n\ncounsel’s perspective at the time.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065; see\n\nHellard v. State, 629 S.W.2d 4, 9 (Tenn. 1982).\n\n\n\n              We also note that the approach to the issue of the ineffective assistance\nof counsel does not have to start with an analysis of an attorney’s conduct. If prejudice\n\nis not shown, we need not seek to determine the validity of the allegations about\n\ndeficient performance. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069.\n\n\n\n\n              Initially, we note that the petitioner contends that this court should adopt a\n\nde novo standard of review when addressing ineffective assistance of counsel claims in\n\npost-conviction appeals. He argues that the trial court’s findings with respect to\n\nineffective assistance are not binding on appeal because the issue involves a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact.\n\n                                            26\n\f              In Henley v. State, 960 S.W.2d 572, 578-79 (Tenn. 1997), our supreme\n\ncourt stated the following relative to review of a trial court’s post-conviction\n\ndeterminations following an evidentiary hearing:\n              The findings of fact of the trial judge on a petitioner for post-\n              conviction relief are afforded the weight of a jury verdict and\n              are conclusive on appeal unless the evidence in the record\n              preponderates against those findings. [Tidwell v. State, 922\n              S.W.2d 497, 500 (Tenn. 1996)]; Cooper v. State, 849 S.W.2d\n              744, 746 (Tenn. 1993); Butler v. State, 789 S.W.2d 898, 899\n              (Tenn. 1990).        In evaluating whether the evidence\n              preponderates against the trial court’s findings, we are guided\n              by longstanding rules of appellate procedure. Appellate courts\n              in this State do not reweigh or reevaluate the evidence. We\n              can not substitute our inferences for those drawn by the trial\n              judge. Moreover, questions concerning the credibility of\n              witnesses, the weight and value to be given their testimony,\n              and the factual issues raised by the evidence are to be\n              resolved by the trial judge. Finally, the party seeking to\n              overturn the findings of the trial judge bears the burden on\n              appeal of demonstrating why the evidence contained in the\n              record preponderates against the findings of the trial judge.\n              Bolin v. State, 219 Tenn. 4, 11, 405 S.W.2d 768, 771 (1966);\n              Cooper, 847 S.W.2d at 527; Black v. State, 794 S.W.2d 752,\n              755 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1990). It is with these principles in mind\n              that we evaluate the findings of the trial court and the Court of\n              Criminal Appeals with respect to the petitioner’s claim of\n              ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing.\n\nThe court stated that the issue before it was “whether the evidence in the record\n\npreponderates against the trial court’s finding that the petitioner failed to establish that\n\nhe was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.” 960 S.W.2d at\n580. See also Richard C. Taylor v. State, No. 01C01-9709-CC-00384, Williamson\n\nCounty (Tenn. Crim. App., July 21, 1999) (citing Henley and holding that the\n\nappropriate standard of review is whether the evidence preponderates against the trial\n\n\ncourt’s findings). In light of Henley and Taylor, we reject the petitioner’s claim that our\n\nreview should be de novo.\n\n\n              We are aware, however, that the Tennessee Supreme Court recently\n\nused a de novo review standard in a direct appeal of a conviction when the issue of the\n\neffective assistance of counsel was presented. See State v. Brenda Ann Burns, No.\nW1996-00004-SC-R11-CD, Henry County, slip op. at 12 (Tenn. Nov. 8, 1999) (for\n\npublication). Given the summary fashion in which the court addressed the standard of\n\nreview in Burns, we seriously doubt that it intended to overrule Henley and thirty years\n\nof similar post-conviction jurisprudence. In any event, even if we are to use a de novo\n\n\n                                             27\n\fstandard relative to the question of whether the petitioner received the effective\n\nassistance of counsel, we do not believe that the petitioner received the ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, given the underlying facts as found by the trial court.\n\n\n                         A. Guilt Phase–Failure to Investigate\n\n              The petitioner contends that his trial attorneys were ineffective during the\nguilt phase of his trial because they failed to investigate the petitioner’s low serotonin\n\nand blood sugar levels and to explore a possible insanity defense. He argues that his\n\nattorneys were ineffective by defending the case solely “on the merits.” The state\ncontends that the trial court correctly found that the petitioner received the effective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n\n\n               The trial court found that the petitioner’s attorneys rendered effective\n\nassistance, making the following findings and conclusions:\n\n              Petitioner was examined twice at the request of his attorneys\n              by a competent forensic psychologist, Dr. Wyatt Nichols, who\n              would not support a defense of insanity. Although not called\n              by either side at the hearing on this petition, Dr. Nichols\n              testified at petitioner’s trial that at the time of the trial he had\n              been practicing clinical psychology for eleven or twelve years,\n              with specialized training in forensic psychology. The State\n              stipulated to his qualifications, and he was accepted by the trial\n              court as an expert in the field of forensic psychology. The\n              constitutional requirements of Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68\n              (1985), were satisfied. Dr. Nichols testified at petitioner’s trial\n              that\n\n                     A. . . . . It was my opinion that [petitioner] was\n                     not criminally insane and did not appear to me to\n                     suffer from a mental illness that was sufficient for\n                     me to be concerned.\n                             Sometimes people who are really\n                     severely mentally ill will say they didn’t do it, but\n                     in fact they may have and there’s a real severe\n                     illness there that will interfere with their ability to\n                     communicate. But I did not see that. So it was\n                     my final opinion that he failed the Graham Vs.\n                     State test, and so basically he was criminally\n                     responsible.\n\n\n                     Q. Does that mean that he -- that you didn’t see\n                     any psychological problems at all?\n\n                     A. No. It doesn’t mean that. It just means that\n                     he didn’t meet the Graham Vs. State criteria that\n                     I mentioned earlier as far as a mental illness.\n\n              There was no indication at the time of petitioner’s trial that Dr.\n\n                                              28\n\f              Nichols’ opinion was in any way impeachable, and the\n              attorneys therefore had no “specialized need” for further\n              evaluation that they could have given the trial court on the\n              issue of an insanity defense during the guilt phase . . . .\n\n                      Mr. Ball . . . testified that in his experience, insanity\n              defenses aren’t very successful, and that he would have to\n              basically admit to the murder, but say petitioner was not legally\n              responsible for it. On redirect, he testified that even though he\n              had no expert proof to rebut the fingerprint evidence, the proof\n              at the trial was that petitioner had been at the victim’s house\n              before, having known the victim and having hung around with\n              her grandson. (The garage petitioner worked at was owned by\n              Mike Lucas, the employer, friend and drug partner of petitioner.\n              He was also the step-grandson of Ms. Skinner.) Mr. Ball felt\n              the case could have been won.\n\n                      . . . . Eliminating the “distorting effect of hindsight, to\n              reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged\n              conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s\n              perspective at the time,” Strickland at 689 and Hellard at 9, it\n              would have been extremely risky to have attempted a defense\n              of insanity, in light of the entirely circumstantial proof offered,\n              even if an expert witness who would support an insanity\n              defense could have been found, knowing that Dr. Nichols in\n              that event would then be called as a state’s witness against the\n              petitioner.\n\n                     This Court finds that not only were petitioner’s attorneys\n              not deficient in their performance during the guilt phase on the\n              issue of insanity, but that there has also been no showing of\n              prejudice to petitioner.\n\n              ....\n\n                     Petitioner has completely failed to carry his burden of\n              proving that his attorneys 1) should have known to file a\n              motion for additional psychological assistance on the issue of\n              insanity, 2) that his attorneys could have shown a specialized\n              need for that assistance, if requested, 3) that the expert\n              assistance, had it been granted, would have revealed a\n              chemical imbalance in petitioner’s system, and 4) if it had, that\n              a viable theory of [insanity] could have been made out to the\n              jury that would have been better than the defense actually\n              tried. Petitioner has not shown that there is a reasonable\n              probability (a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\n              the outcome) that but for counsel’s not asking for additional\n              psychological assistance, the result of the guilt phase would\n              have been different. Strickland, at 694. Petitioner has not\n              established either prong of the Strickland test, either deficiency\n              or prejudice, in the guilt phase, and therefore this allegation is\n              without merit.\n\n\n\n              We hold that the petitioner has failed to establish that the record\npreponderates against the trial court’s findings. Mr. Ball testified that the petitioner\n\ncould carry on intelligent conversations and that the petitioner did not act out of touch\n\nwith reality. Mr. Ball further testified that the petitioner did not want to pursue an\ninsanity defense. The petitioner was examined twice by Dr. Nichols, and although he\n\n\n                                             29\n\frecommended further testing to discover the extent of the petitioner’s mental condition,\n\nhe stated that his findings would not support an insanity defense. Thus, the petitioner\n\nhas not shown that his attorneys would have been able to demonstrate a specialized\nneed for further evaluation of the petitioner to pursue an insanity defense.\n\n\n\n       B. Sentencing Phase–Failure to Investigate and Request Expert Services\n          The petitioner contends that his attorneys were ineffective during the\n\nsentencing phase of trial. He argues that the attorneys failed to investigate fully the\n\npetitioner’s background and failed to seek expert mental services for mitigation until the\ntrial had already begun. The petitioner argues that the jury might have returned a life\n\nsentence if it was presented with the evidence regarding the petitioner’s low serotonin\n\nlevel, hypoglycemia and alcohol addiction, as well as more detailed information about\nthe petitioner’s tumultuous relationship with his family, particularly his mother. The\n\nstate contends that the attorneys were not deficient and that the petitioner has failed to\n\ndemonstrate prejudice. Regarding the presentation of mitigating evidence during the\n\ncapital cases, our supreme court has stated as follows:\n\n                     Where the alleged prejudice under Strickland involves\n              counsel’s failure to present mitigating evidence in the penalty\n              phase of a capital trial, several factors are significant. First,\n              courts have analyzed the nature and extent of the mitigating\n              evidence that was available but not presented. Second, courts\n              have considered whether substantially similar mitigating\n              evidence was presented to the jury in either the guilt or penalty\n              phase of the proceedings. Finally, the courts have considered\n              whether there was such strong evidence of aggravating factors\n              that the mitigating evidence would not have affected the jury’s\n              determination.\n\nGoad v. State, 938 S.W.2d 363, 371 (Tenn. 1990) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n              First, we will address the petitioner’s contention that his attorneys were\n\nineffective for failing to conduct further investigation into his social background for\nmitigation evidence at the sentencing phase. We believe that the petitioner has\n\ndemonstrated neither deficiency nor prejudice. With respect to the attorneys’ failure to\n\nsecure the petitioner’s school records, Mr. Ball testified that both he and the public\n\ndefender requested but never received the materials. Mr. Ball testified that he went to\nLouisiana and spoke with the petitioner’s family but that he was not allowed access to\n\nthe petitioner’s mother. He testified that during his interviews with the petitioner’s father\n\nand brothers, he learned that the petitioner was severely abused as a child. Defense\n\n                                             30\n\fcounsel presented this evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial, along with\n\nevidence of the petitioner’s enuresis and the problems associated with it and the\n\npetitioner’s abuse of alcohol and drugs. The trial court’s order denying post-conviction\nrelief states the following:\n\n              This brief summary of the high points in the mitigation\n              evidence presented in petitioner’s trial does not adequately\n              reflect the quality or extent of the proof offered. Altogether,\n              petitioner presented 167 pages of transcript in mitigation\n              during the sentencing phase. Much of it was highly emotional,\n              and even from a cold reading of the transcript seven years\n              later this Court was moved by petitioner’s account, and his\n              brothers’ accounts, of his tragic childhood.\n\nThe petitioner has failed to show that his attorneys did not adequately investigate and\n\npresent his social history, nor has he shown a reasonable probability that, had they\nperformed further investigation, the outcome of the sentencing phase would have been\n\ndifferent.\n\n\n\n              With respect to the petitioner’s contention that his attorneys were\n\nineffective for failing to request expert mental services for mitigation until after the trial\n\nhad started, the trial court found that the attorneys were deficient. The trial court stated\n\nthat because Dr. Nichols suggested additional neurological testing to explore the\n\npetitioner’s mental condition, the trial judge “would most likely have given the attorneys\nfunds for this neurological workup and also a continuance to obtain it.” However, the\n\ntrial court found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice. The trial court\n\ndetermined that all of the proof raised at the evidentiary hearing was presented at the\nmitigation hearing, except for the evidence of the petitioner’s hypoglycemia, low\n\nserotonin, and the effects of the two when combined with alcohol and drugs. The trial\n\ncourt determined that even if the petitioner had been further evaluated, it is unlikely that\nhis serotonin and glucose levels would have been tested. The trial court found that\n\nsubstantially similar mitigating evidence was presented at trial in that Dr. Nichols\n\ntestified that the petitioner may have had an organic brain impairment that interfered\n\nwith his ability to control urges. Finally, the trial court determined that the strong\nevidence of other aggravating factors shows that the mitigating evidence would not\n\nhave affected the jury’s determination. See Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 371.\n\n\n\n              The record supports the trial court’s finding of deficient performance. The\n\n\n                                              31\n\fpetitioner’s attorneys originally made an ex parte motion for expert services that was\n\ndenied for failure to comply with Rule 13, § 2(B)(10), Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. Then, in what\n\nthe trial court characterized as a last ditch effort to secure expert services, the attorneys\npresented a letter from Dr. Nichols to support their specialized need for evaluation, and\n\nthey requested a continuance in order to conduct the evaluation. However, they did not\n\npresent the letter until the fifth day of trial. As the trial court stated in its order denying\nthe post-conviction petition, “[w]hen proof of a specialized need is not obtained until the\n\nfifth day of trial, however, there is not much likelihood that a continuance will be\n\ngranted.” The petitioners have provided no reason why this letter or an affidavit from\nDr. Nichols was not presented before trial. Failure to investigate, follow up, and present\n\nevidence of a history of mental problems for use at the sentencing phase of a capital\n\ncase is deficient performance. Cooper v. State, 847 S.W.2d 521, 530-32 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992).\n\n\n\n              Despite the attorneys’ deficiency, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate\n\nthat the record preponderates against the trial court’s determination of no prejudice.\n\nMost significant is the fact that the petitioner has not shown that if the evaluation\n\nsuggested by Dr. Nichols had been performed, evidence of the petitioner’s\n\nhypoglycemia or low serotonin would have been discovered. The trial court found as\n\nfollows:\n              [A]t the time of petitioner’s trial in 1990, the “low serotonin”\n              defense and the “low blood sugar” defense were relatively\n              unknown. There were only three significant articles\n              produced by petitioner that had been published in this area\n              in scientific journals. . . . It is clear that the relationship\n              between serotonin and impulsive behavior was not widely\n              known in 1990. Dr. Auble had not yet attended any\n              seminars in forensic psychology at the time of petitioner’s\n              trial, and Dr. Martell had not yet published any of his articles\n              on the relationship between serotonin and violent behavior.\n              Dr. Nichols had suggested to the attorneys that a “Q Beam”\n              or an “MRI” be performed . . . . Both Drs. Auble and Martell\n              agree that those tests would have turned up nothing useful\n              in petitioner’s defense had the attorneys requested and\n              obtained funds for them. No one at any time ever suggested\n              to petitioner’s trial attorneys that they test the chemical\n              balance of his spinal fluid.\n\n               They could hardly have been expected to have been familiar\n               with 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid, or to have read any of those\n               three articles on their own.\n\nIn light of the fact that the “low serotonin” and “low blood sugar” research and theories\n\nwere not widely known and that Dr. Nichols’ suggested evaluation did not contemplate\n\n                                               32\n\ftesting for such imbalances, the petitioner has not demonstrated a reasonable\n\nprobability that but for his attorneys’ deficiency in failing to request expert services in a\n\ntimely fashion, the outcome of the sentencing phase would have been different.\n\n\n              In making this determination, we are also mindful of the principles set forth\n\nin Goad. The trial court made the following determinations with respect to these\n\nprinciples:\n\n                     The first question to be considered under Goad . . . is\n              the nature and extent of the mitigating evidence that was\n              available but not presented. Except for proof at the hearing on\n              this petition of petitioner’s low serotonin levels and low glucose\n              tolerance level, and their effect on petitioner when combined\n              with drug and alcohol use, all other proof of mitigation raised\n              by petitioner in the hearing on this petition had already been\n              presented at trial by his attorneys, in one form or another,\n              through jail records, lay witnesses, family members of\n              petitioner, and Dr. Nichols. . . .\n\n                      The second consideration under Goad is “whether\n              substantially similar mitigating evidence was presented to the\n              jury in either the guilt phase or penalty phase of the\n              proceedings.” The possibility that petitioner had these\n              problems due to a medical or psychological condition was\n              presented to the jury during mitigation proof by Dr. Nichols. He\n              testified that\n\n                     Mr. Cazes’s behavior as far as his history of\n                     chemical dependency which causes brain\n                     damage over an extended period of time like\n                     he’s abused chemicals, plus even before he\n                     started abusing chemicals he had a lot of\n                     difficulties with impulse control, rages, becoming\n                     angry for no apparent reason, and becoming –\n                     going into a rage and being destructive at times.\n                     And people who have these problems, a fairly\n                     high number of them have neurological\n                     problems.\n\n                              What I mean by neurological problems,\n                      some kind of organic impairment with their brain\n                      that interferes with their ability to control an urge,\n                      a momentary urge. Not necessarily that it would\n                      interfere with their ability to plan out something\n                      over a long term, but any time their affect or their\n                      feelings are elevated, be it anxiety, be it anger,\n                      be it excitement, they’re happy about something\n                      just like a little child at Christmas may get into a\n                      lot more trouble because they’re real excited\n                      about things, well, they’re having impulse control\n                      problems. Well, that’s what I’m talking about\n                      here, that when his affect is up, his feeling level\n                      is up, then he may have more difficulty or he\n                      does have more difficulty controlling himself.\n\n                            There’s a possibility that that is due to\n                      some brain impairment or organic impairment .\n                      ...\n\n\n                                               33\n\f              Even though we know now, after petitioner has been\n              thoroughly tested, that he had no significant brain damage due\n              to drug use or head trauma, still the jury was told that it was a\n              distinct possibility that many of his problems were caused by\n              a condition out of his control.\n              The third Goad consideration is “whether there was such\n              strong evidence of aggravating factors that the mitigating\n              evidence would not have affected the jury’s determination.”\n              Assuming therefore, that the attorneys had properly and timely\n              requested and received funds, and time, to further evaluate\n              petitioner, and that they had in fact found an expert who was\n              acquainted with the relationship between serotonin and\n              impulsive behavior, and petitioner decided to present that\n              mitigation evidence to the jury (that a combination of low\n              serotonin, low blood sugar, extensive substance abuse, tragic\n              childhood and hatred of women had all combined to make\n              petitioner not responsible for his actions), the state would have\n              been able to rebut that theory with petitioner’s history of\n              continued violence in a prison setting while awaiting trial,\n              during a time when he had a raised serotonin level, was not on\n              junk food, and was not using alcohol or illegal drugs. This\n              violent behavior would most likely have alienated the jury. An\n              important part of this theory of petitioner also concerns his\n              hatred of women and his continued violence toward them, a\n              rage which was “triggered” by an “emotional memory,”\n              compelling him to rape and murder Ms. Skinner in a “fugue\n              state.” This would have also tended to alienate the jury, and\n              in view of the aggravating circumstance offered in this trial that\n              petitioner had been convicted of the Aggravated Rape and\n              Attempted Murder of another woman which was committed\n              after the murder of Ms. Skinner, may have practically ensured\n              a sentence of death.\n\n              ....\n\n              Considering the nature of the omitted mitigation, necessarily\n              involving petitioner’s hatred of women and his lack of control\n              even when not on drugs, alcohol, junk food and low serotonin,\n              as compared to the strong aggravating factors [1) “heinous,\n              atrocious and cruel,” in that the crime involved a driving to the\n              scene, a systematic, premeditated breaking into the home of\n              a known elderly victim, an extremely bloody, brutal murder and\n              rape . . . ., plus 2) “prior convictions for crimes of violence” in\n              that petitioner, after raping and killing Ms. Skinner, committed\n              and was convicted of another Aggravated Rape and Assault\n              to Murder] petitioner has failed to show prejudice. . . . “Given\n              the overwhelming aggravating factors, there is no reasonable\n              probability that the omitted evidence would have changed the\n              conclusion of the jury that the aggravating circumstances\n              outweighed the mitigating circumstances and hence, the\n              sentence imposed.” Strickland, at 697.\n\nConsidering the petitioner’s inability to demonstrate even a possibility that serotonin\n\nand blood sugar testing would have been performed and considering the principles set\nforth in Goad and their application to this case, we conclude that the petitioner has not\n\ndemonstrated prejudice.\n\n\n\n                C. Petitioner’s Right to a Limited Cross-examination\n\n\n                                             34\n\f          The petitioner contends that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to protect\n\nhis right to a limited cross-examination during the sentencing phase of trial. He\n\ncontends that he wanted to testify at the sentencing phase about his background\nwithout being subject to cross-examination regarding details of the crime and that his\n\nattorneys filed a motion to prevent the state from asking questions about the crime,\n\nwhich the trial court denied. The petitioner argues that his attorneys offered no support\nfor their motion and inadvertently waived the issue for appeal by asking the petitioner\n\nwhat he remembered about the day of the murder.\n\n\n\n              On direct appeal, our supreme court acknowledged that “in the limited\n\nsphere of a death penalty sentencing hearing, a capital defendant’s testimony regarding\n\nmitigating factors that are wholly collateral to the merits of the charges against him does\nnot operate as a complete waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination.” Cazes,\n\n875 S.W.2d at 266. Nevertheless, the court determined that the petitioner was not\n\nprejudiced by the cross-examination because the petitioner could not recall anything\n\nabout the crime. Id. Similarly, in denying post-conviction relief, the trial court concluded\n\nthat the “state’s cross-examination was therefore effectively limited by petitioner’s\n\ntestimony that he lacked any knowledge of the circumstances of the offense.” The\n\npetitioner has not demonstrated that the record preponderates against this finding.\n\n\n\n                             D. Conceding Premeditation\n\n          The petitioner contends that counsel were ineffective during closing argument\n\nat sentencing because they mentioned that the jury had already found premeditation.\nThe petitioner contends that because he was convicted of felony murder, which does\n\nnot require premeditation, this erroneous reference by counsel resulted in prejudice.\n\nThe petitioner offers no support for this argument, and we hold that it is without merit. A\nreview of the closing argument shows that counsel focused not on the crime itself but\n\non mitigation. The petitioner has not demonstrated prejudice.\n\n\n\n                       E. Failure to Raise all Issues on Appeal\n              The petitioner contends that his attorneys were ineffective on appeal for\n\nfailing to raise all issues. Specifically, he contends that the attorneys should have\n\nargued that (1) the jury’s finding of the “prior violent felony” aggravating circumstance\n\n                                            35\n\fviolated the ex post facto and due process clauses of the Tennessee and United States\n\nConstitutions, (2) the reasonable doubt jury instruction violated the due process clause\n\nof the United States Constitution, and (3) the manner in which appellate courts conduct\nharmless error analysis in capital cases violates state guarantees of trial by jury and\n\nfederal guarantees of due process. Our supreme court has previously determined that\n\nthese issues are without merit. See King v. State, 992 S.W.2d 946 (Tenn. 1999); State\n\nv. Bigbee, 885 S.W.2d 797, 817 (Tenn. 1994); State v. Nichols, 877 S.W.2d 722, 734\n\n(Tenn. 1994); State v. Howell, 868 S.W.2d 238 (Tenn. 1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                  III. IMPARTIAL JURY\n\n              The petitioner contends that he was denied the right to an impartial jury\nbecause the trial court refused to allow individual, sequestered voir dire concerning\n\npretrial publicity. In conjunction, he argues that his attorneys were ineffective for failing\n\nto include examples of pretrial publicity in the record for appeal.\n\n\n\n              With respect to the petitioner’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\nthe petitioner claims that his attorneys failed to include examples of the pretrial publicity\n\nin the record for appeal. The petitioner argues that this precluded the supreme court\n\nfrom adequately addressing the jury voir dire issues on appeal. However, this particular\nclaim was neither included in the post-conviction petition below nor addressed by the\n\ntrial court. Accordingly, this issue is not properly before this court and is waived. See\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-112 (1990); Butler v. State, 789 S.W.2d 898, 902 (Tenn.\n1990); Brown v. State, 928 S.W.2d 453, 457 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996). Regardless, the\n\npetitioner has failed to establish prejudice.\n\n\n\n              “Individual voir dire is mandated only when there is a ‘significant\n\npossibility’ that a juror has been exposed to potentially prejudicial material.” State v.\n\nHarris, 839 S.W.2d 54, 65 (Tenn. 1992) (citing State v. Porterfield, 746 S.W.2d 411,\n\n447 (Tenn. 1988)). The decision of the trial court to deny individual voir dire of the\nvenire remains within the sound discretion of the court and will not be reversed on\n\nappeal absent a finding of manifest error. Howell, 868 S.W.2d at 247-48. The\n\npetitioner must demonstrate that the jurors were biased or prejudiced against him\n\n                                                36\n\fbecause of the pretrial publicity. State v. Melson, 638 S.W.2d 342, 360-61 (Tenn.\n\n1982). Mere exposure to news accounts of the incident does not, standing alone,\n\nestablish bias or prejudice. Prospective jurors can have knowledge of the facts\nsurrounding the crime and still be qualified to sit on the jury. State v. Bates, 804\n\nS.W.2d 868, 877 (Tenn. 1991). The test is “whether the jurors who actually sat and\n\nrendered verdicts were prejudiced by the pretrial publicity.” State v. Kyger, 787 S.W.2d\n13, 18-19 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1989).\n\n\n\n              In support of his claim, the petitioner relies upon State v. Claybrook, 736\n\nS.W.2d 95 (Tenn. 1987) and State v. Shepherd, 862 S.W.2d 557 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1992). In both of these cases, the court determined that the trial court’s refusal to allow\n\nindividual, sequestered voir dire was prejudicial error because the prospective jurors\nadmitted that they knew the defendants had been charged with or convicted of other\n\ncrimes. In Claybrook, the court determined that the need to conduct individual,\n\nsequestered voir dire became apparent “when it was made known to the trial court that\n\n80% of the first group of prospective jurors had heard information regarding the\n\ndefendant’s case, two members of that initial panel mentioned in the presence of other\n\nprospective jurors that they had heard that the defendant had been in prison before.”\n\n736 S.W.2d at 100.\n\n\n\n              In the present case, however, the jurors were not questioned about their\n\nknowledge of the petitioner’s previous record. Additionally, as the trial court noted in\n\ndenying post-conviction relief, “[o]f the prospective jurors examined, approximately\ntwenty-five percent had been exposed to some pretrial publicity about this case . . . .”\n\nThe record establishes that only two of the jurors who heard the petitioner’s case had\n\nbeen exposed to pretrial publicity, and unlike Claybrook, no evidence exists that the\n\njurors heard information that the petitioner had previously been in jail. The empaneled\n\njurors stated that they could render an impartial verdict based solely upon the evidence\n\npresented at trial. Thus, the petitioner has not demonstrated, as is required, that the\n\njurors who actually heard his case were biased or prejudiced because of pretrial\npublicity.\n\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\f                 Finally, we note that in his reply brief, the petitioner asserts in a footnote\n\nthat Rule 606(b), Tenn. R. Evid., effectively precluded him from demonstrating prejudice\n\nby disallowing the testimony of jurors at the evidentiary hearing. He relies upon Henley\n\nv. State, 960 S.W.2d 572 (Tenn. 1997). In Henley, the petitioner presented affidavits\n\nfrom jurors at the evidentiary hearing stating that they were swayed against the\n\npetitioner because his mother did not testify during the sentencing phase of a capital\ntrial. The court concluded that the affidavits were not admissible because they “related\n\nto the precise subject matter about which a juror is strictly forbidden from testifying by\n\nRule 606(b)- the effect of the mother’s failure to testify on the jury verdict.” 960 S.W.2d\nat 581. However, we do not believe that the holding in Henley precludes the use of\n\njuror affidavits to prove prejudicial exposure to pretrial publicity. See, e.g., Claybrook,\n\n736 S.W.2d at 100-01 (holding that jurors’ testimony regarding exposure to pretrial\npublicity allowed at motion for new trial); State v. Robert Emmet Dunlap, Jr., No.\n\n02C01-9801-CC-00009, Henry County (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 21, 1998) (holding that\n\nthe “extraneous prejudicial information” exception to the admissibility of juror testimony\n\nincludes a juror’s personal knowledge of an accused’s prior criminal record).\n\n\n\n                       IV. USE OF AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE\n\n          The petitioner contends that the use of his previous convictions for\n\naggravated rape and assault with intent to murder, based on conduct that occurred\nafter the present offenses but for which the petitioner was convicted before the present\n\noffenses, violates the due process and ex post facto clauses of the state and federal\n\nconstitutions.\n\n\n          The petitioner committed the crimes against Ms. Skinner at issue in this case\n\nin April 1988. In June 1989, the petitioner committed separate offenses of attempted\nmurder and aggravated rape, and he was convicted of these crimes before the trial in\n\n\n\nthe present case. The state relied upon these previous convictions as an aggravating\n\ncircumstance. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-2-302(I)(2).\n\n\n\n          The petitioner contends that using convictions for crimes committed after the\n\noffense in the present case to enhance his punishment in the present case violates due\n\n                                                38\n\fprocess and ex post facto. Our supreme court rejected the same argument in State v.\n\nCaldwell, 671 S.W.2d 459, 465 (Tenn. 1984). In Caldwell, the court stated:\n\n              The Defendant avers that it was error for the Trial Court to\n              allow the introduction of his conviction for first degree murder\n              in the Lipford case as an aggravating circumstance in this\n              case, since the Lipford murder occurred after the [murder in\n              this case].\n              ....\n\n              Caldwell claims that using the subsequent murder as an\n              aggravating circumstance permits an ex post facto law. The\n              language in the statute, “previously convicted” clearly indicates\n              that the date of the conviction, not of the commission of the\n              crime, is the important factor. The order in which the crimes\n              were actually committed is irrelevant, as long as the\n              convictions have been entered before the sentencing hearing\n              at which they are introduced into evidence.\nId. at 464-65; see also State v. Hodges, 944 S.W.2d 346, 357 (Tenn. 1997) ( “We have\n\npreviously held on numerous occasions that so long as a defendant is convicted of a\n\nviolent felony prior to the sentencing hearing at which the previous conviction is\nintroduced, this aggravating circumstance is applicable.”). In the present case, the\n\naggravating circumstance was in effect at the time the petitioner committed the crimes\n\nagainst Ms. Skinner. In addition, Caldwell provided further notice to the petitioner that\n\nfuture convictions could be used to enhance punishment, regardless of when the\n\ncriminal acts underlying the convictions were committed. This issue is without merit.\n\n\n                             V. EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE\n\n          The petitioner contends that the state withheld police reports containing\nexculpatory information in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 370 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194\n\n(1963). He argues that the information in the police reports was exculpatory, claiming\n\nthat it provided substantial clues that should have led the trial attorneys to investigate\npetitioner’s mental condition. The state contends that the prosecutor was not required\n\nto disclose the complete police investigation and that, in any event, the information\n\ncontained in the reports was not exculpatory.\n\n\n\n          The state has a duty to furnish exculpatory evidence to the accused, and any\n\n“suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request\n\nviolates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment,\nirrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” Brady, 373 U.S. at 87, 83\n\n\n                                             39\n\fS. Ct. at 1196-97. This evidence may pertain to the guilt or innocence of the accused\n\nor to the punishment which may be imposed if the accused is convicted of the crime.\n\nSee State v. Marshall, 845 S.W.2d 228, 233 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992). Moreover, this\nduty to disclose extends to all favorable information regardless of whether the evidence\n\nis admissible. Branch v. State, 469 S.W.2d 533, 534 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1969).\n\nAlthough Brady does not require the state to investigate for the defendant, it does\nburden the prosecution with the responsibility of disclosing statements of witnesses\n\nfavorable to the defense. State v. Reynolds, 671 S.W.2d 854, 856 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1984). The duty does not extend to information that the defense already possesses or\nis able to obtain or to information not in the possession or control of the prosecution.\n\nBanks v. State, 556 S.W.2d 88, 90 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1977). Similarly, there is “‘no\n\nconstitutional requirement that the prosecution make a complete and detailed\naccounting to the defense of all police investigatory work on a case.’” State v. Walker,\n\n910 S.W.2d 381, 389 (Tenn. 1995) (quoting Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 92 S. Ct.\n\n2562 (1972)).\n\n\n\n              In order to establish a Brady due process violation, the following elements\n\nmust be proven:\n\n              (1) The defendant must have requested the information\n              (unless the evidence is obviously exculpatory, in which case\n              the State is bound to release the information whether\n              requested or not);\n\n                (2) The State must have suppressed the information;\n                (3) The information must have been favorable to the accused;\n                and\n                (4) The information must have been material.\n\nState v. Edgin, 902 S.W.2d 387, 389 (Tenn. 1995). In Edgin, our supreme court\n\nadopted the following standard for materiality:\n              [T]here is constitutional error “if there is a reasonable\n              probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the\n              defense, the result of the proceeding would have been\n              different.”\n              ....\n\n                “[The] touchstone of materiality is a ‘reasonable probability’ of\n                a different result, and the adjective is important. The question\n                is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have\n                received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its\n                absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting\n                in a verdict worthy of confidence. A ‘reasonable probability’ of\n                a different result is accordingly shown when the Government’s\n\n                                               40\n\f              evidentiary suppression ‘undermines confidence in the\n              outcome of the trial.’”\n902 S.W.2d at 390 (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 1556\n\n(1995)).\n\n\n\n              The petitioner’s attorney testified at the evidentiary hearing that he never\n\nreceived copies of the police reports. Gloria Shettles testified that she interviewed the\n\npersons named in the report and that they stated that the petitioner was an excellent\nworker; did not take criticism well; was impatient, emotional and impulsive; and would\n\nbecome angry and out of control when he was drinking. The trial court dismissed the\n\nclaim, finding that the petitioner did not specifically define his issue and offered\ninsufficient proof to support his allegations.\n\n\n\n              We believe that the petitioner’s claim fails because he has not established\nthat he was unable to obtain the information himself, that the evidence was favorable,\n\nor that the information was material. The information contained in the police reports is\n\ngeneral background information of the petitioner’s demeanor, provided by the\n\npetitioner’s friends, acquaintances and former employers. Because the information\n\ncame from people the petitioner knew, there is no reason why he could not have\nobtained the information himself. Additionally, the information does not contain direct\n\nexculpatory information. Despite the petitioner’s argument that the information could\n\nhave led his attorneys to investigate the petitioner’s mental status further, the police\nreports do not provide any additional information of which the attorneys were not\n\nalready aware at trial. Furthermore, we believe that the petitioner has not\n\ndemonstrated a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different had his attorneys been aware of the reports. We have previously\n\ndetermined that the trial court properly found against the petitioner regarding his claim\n\nof ineffective investigation into a possible insanity defense. Thus, the petitioner has\n\nfailed to show that the information is material.\n\n\n                   VI. REASONABLE DOUBT JURY INSTRUCTION\n\n              The petitioner contends that the reasonable doubt jury instructions at both\nphases of his trial were unconstitutional because the trial court used the term “moral\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fcertainty” and excluded from the definition a “doubt that may arise from possibility.” The\n\nreasonable doubt jury instructions contested by the petitioner were upheld as\n\nconstitutional. See Carter v. State, 958 S.W.2d 620, 625 (Tenn. 1997); Nichols, 877\nS.W.2d at 734. This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n                     VII. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ERROR\n              The petitioner contends that the cumulative effect of all the alleged\n\nconstitutional errors resulted in the petitioner being deprived of a fair trial. See State v.\n\nCadle, 634 S.W.2d 623, 626 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1982). Considering our rulings in this\n\n\ncase, we conclude that no errors exist that cumulatively would deprive the petitioner of\n\na fair trial. See Rosenthal v. State, 292 S.W.2d 1, 4-5 (Tenn. 1956).\n\n\n\n                             VIII. HARMLESS ERROR ANALYSIS\n\n              The petitioner contends that the Tennessee Supreme Court’s harmless\n\nerror analysis on direct appeal with respect to the jury’s erroneous application of the\n\nfelony murder aggravating circumstance violated his right to a jury determination of\n\nsentencing and to due process of law. He argues that Tennessee law creates a due\n\nprocess liberty interest in jury resentencing that precludes the court’s application of a\n\nharmless error analysis when the sentencing jury has considered an invalid aggravating\ncircumstance. This argument has been rejected by our supreme court. See Boyd v.\n\nState, 959 S.W.2d 557, 560 (Tenn. 1998) (holding that a jury’s reliance on an invalid\n\nfelony murder aggravating factor does not require a resentencing hearing if the\nreviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the sentence would have\n\nbeen the same had the jury given no weight to the invalid aggravating factor). This\n\nissue is without merit.\n\n\n              IX. IN CAMERA REVIEW OF PROSECUTOR’S FILES\n\n              The petitioner contends that the trial court erred by failing to conduct an in\n\ncamera review of the prosecutor’s files regarding other crimes with which the petitioner\nhad been charged. The petitioner sought to review the files to find information\n\npertaining to his post-conviction issues, particularly the issue of his mental state, but the\n\ntrial court denied the motion. The files pertain to alleged acts of child sexual abuse,\n\n                                             42\n\fand the trial court denied the request pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-1-612, which\n\nprohibits the disclosure of all records concerning reports of child sexual abuse. The\n\nstatute provides limited circumstances under which disclosure may be allowed, but the\ntrial court determined that those circumstances did not apply in this case.\n\n\n\n               The petitioner cites Munke v. Munke, 882 S.W.2d 803, 804 (Tenn. Ct.\n\nApp. 1994), to support his contention that the trial court was required to conduct an in\n\ncamera inspection. However, in that case, the court held that an inspection was\n\nrequired under the statutory exception to disclosure “for the purpose of protecting a\nchild or children from child abuse or child sexual abuse . . . .” Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-1-\n\n612(h). This exception does not apply to the petitioner’s case. This issue is without\n\nmerit. See, e.g., State v. Caughron, 855 S.W.2d 526, 541 (Tenn. 1993) (holding that a\n\ntrial court is not required to review the entire prosecutor’s file absent a specific showing\n\nfrom the petitioner).\n\n\n\n               In consideration of the foregoing and the record as a whole, the judgment\n\nof the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                          ______________________________\n                                          Joseph M.

Tipton\nJudge\n\n                                       OPINION\n\n\n\n              The petitioner, Victor James Cazes, appeals as of right from the order of\n\nthe Shelby County Criminal Court denying him post-conviction relief from his 1990\n\fconvictions for felony murder, aggravated rape and first degree burglary. The petitioner\n\nwas sentenced to death for the murder conviction and received twenty-five-year and\n\nsix-year sentences, respectively, for the aggravated rape and burglary convictions. The\njudgments of conviction were affirmed on direct appeal. State v. Cazes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384392\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384392/state-v-cazes/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1994). In this post-conviction appeal, the petitioner raises the following\n\nissues:\n              (1) whether the trial judge at the evidentiary hearing should\n              have recused himself and reassigned the petition to another\n              division of the trial court;\n\n              (2) whether the petitioner was denied the effective assistance\n              of counsel;\n\n              (3) whether the petitioner was denied his right to an impartial\n              jury;\n\n              (4) whether the use of the petitioner’s felony convictions as an\n              aggravating circumstance violated the principles of due\n              process and ex post facto;\n\n              (5) whether the state withheld exculpatory information;\n\n              (6) whether the reasonable doubt jury instructions were\n              constitutional;\n\n              (7) whether the cumulative effect of the foregoing errors\n              deprived the petitioner of a fair trial and due process;\n\n              (8) whether a harmless error analysis relative to invalid\n              aggravating circumstances is constitutional; and\n              (9) whether the trial court erred by not conducting an in camera\n              review of the prosecutor’s files.\n\nWe affirm the trial court’s denial of the post-conviction petition.\n\n\n              The facts surrounding the crimes in this case are described by the\n\nTennessee Supreme Court in its opinion on direct appeal as follows:\n                     The State’s proof introduced at the guilt phase of trial\n              demonstrated that on Sunday morning, April 24, 1988, the\n              body of Gladys Skinner, an older woman who lived alone, was\n              found in her home in the Frayser area of Memphis. She had\n              last been seen alive late Saturday night by Ben Harris, a friend\n              who brought her home from a card game. After checking Ms.\n              Skinner’s house to make sure everything was “safe and\n              secure,” Harris left around 12:10 a.m.\n\n                     The next morning, because her telephone was busy\n              each time they called, Gladys Skinner’s daughter and\n              grandson went to her house to check on her. When they\n              arrived, they noticed that a front window screen had been\n              removed, that the window was broken, that blood was on the\n              window blinds, and that the doors to the house were locked.\n              The grandson and a neighbor entered the house through the\n\n                                              2\n\ffront window and found Gladys Skinner’s body lying beneath\nsome bedcovers on the bedroom floor, between the bed and\nthe wall. The wall next to the bed was spattered with blood as\nwere several pictures from the wall that lay broken on the floor.\nBlood also stained the floor and the fitted sheet on the bed.\nWhile the bedroom had been ransacked, nothing of value was\nmissing from the house.\n\n        Gladys Skinner’s nude body was lying face down, her\nknees underneath her with her buttocks “jacked up off the\nfloor” and her legs spread apart. Scrape marks were found on\nher inner legs and vagina. Her right breast had been bitten\nand her left breast was scraped. Dilation of the vagina and\nrectum demonstrated penetration at or after the time of death;\nhowever, no sperm were found. Numerous marks and bruises\nwere found on her body, including defensive wounds to her\narms and hands, and a large bruise on her back that the proof\nindicated could have been caused by a fist.\n\n        The Shelby County medical examiner testified that the\nvictim’s death was caused by skull injuries that were inflicted\nby multiple blows to the head with a blunt instrument, like a\nwelder’s chipping hammer. According to the medical examiner\nand a forensic anthropologist who examined the skull, the\nnumber of blows had ranged from eight to fifteen and the skull\nhad been “virtually shattered” by the force of the blows. Their\nproof showed that one or more of these injuries would have\ncaused death within minutes to an hour, but the victim would\nnot necessarily have lost consciousness immediately. A\nforensic serologist’s testimony indicated that the assault may\nhave continued for some time. The serologist testified that\nsome blows may have been struck after the blood from some\nof the wounds had begun clotting, and that it takes three to\nfifteen minutes for blood to clot outside the body.\n\n       At the time of the murder, the defendant, Victor Cazes,\na welder, worked sporadically as a handyman at an automotive\nrepair garage owned by Michael Lucas, Gladys Skinner’s step-\ngrandchild. Before the murder, Cazes had been to Gladys\nSkinner’s house two to three times to work on her car. On\nSaturday night, April 23, 1988, Cazes attended a birthday\ncookout at Lucas’s home, which was a few blocks from\nSkinner’s house. He left the gathering alone around 10 or 11\np.m.\n\n         Circumstantial evidence tied the defendant, Victor\nCazes, to the offense. His finger and palm prints were found\non the front window screen and frame. Two of his fingerprints\nwere lifted from a light bulb beside the back door and fresh pry\nmarks were found on the [back door]. Gladys Skinner routinely\nleft this back light on at night, and it was on when Ben Harris\nleft her house shortly after midnight Sunday morning. When\nher body was found, the light was off and the bulb was loose\nin its socket, as if it had been unscrewed.\n\n        Michael Lucas testified that Victor Cazes owned two or\nthree chipping hammers, which Lucas described as blunt\ninstruments made entirely of steel with a point on one end, a\nchisel flat on the other end, and a coil-wired handle. A forensic\nanthropologist testified that a pattern of depressions located in\nthe involved portion of the victim’s skull were consistent with\nridges on the striking surface of a particular welder’s chipping\nhammer owned by Cazes. The hammer had been crafted into\na metal knick-knack by Cazes after the crime and given to a\nfriend’s mother. The forensic serologist also testified that a\n\n                               3\n\ftransfer blood stain on the victim’s bedsheet was caused by\ncontact with a wet, bloody object which was consistent with the\nsize and shape of this same chipping hammer and another like\nit that Cazes had left at the home of his friend’s mother.\n\n       Dr. Richard Souviron, a forensic odontologist, testified\nthat, based upon his comparison of the bite marks on Gladys\nSkinner’s breasts with molds and models of Cazes’ teeth, he\nhad concluded to a reasonable degree of dental certainty that\nCazes’ teeth had made the bite marks on the victim’s body at\nor about the time of her death. Another forensic odontologist,\nDr. Harry Mincer, testified that the defendant Cazes could have\nmade the bite marks on the victim. Two women who had\nengaged in sexual intercourse with Cazes testified that he had\nalso bitten them, and that the victim’s body position was one\nhe preferred during sex.\n\n       The defendant presented no proof.\n\n      Based on this evidence in the guilt phase, the jury found\nthe defendant, Victor Cazes, guilty of first-degree felony\nmurder in the perpetration of rape, and also guilty of\naggravated rape and first-degree burglary.\n        In the sentencing phase of the trial, the State relied\nupon the evidence presented during the guilt phase and also\nintroduced records of the defendant’s previous convictions in\nShelby County, Tennessee, in February 1990 for “assault [with\nintent to commit murder in the first degree] with bodily injury”\nand for aggravated rape.\n\n\n        In mitigation, the defendant introduced medical records\nfrom the period of his incarceration in the Shelby County Jail\nto show that he had required medical treatment on several\noccasions as a result of fights, and that he had been placed on\nsuicide watch twice while incarcerated. An acquaintance\ntestified that the defendant was a heavy user of alcohol,\nmarijuana and cocaine, and that he sometimes could not\nremember what he had done while he was intoxicated.\n\n        The defendant and two of his brothers testified about his\nbackground. One of twelve children, the defendant had been\nunable to control his urination until he was twenty. He testified\nthat his father had beaten him when he was young. One\nbrother described the defendant as “hot-tempered” and\n“always fighting.” The defendant said that he fought because\nother people would tease him when he wet on himself. In the\nseventh grade, after being arrested for truancy, the defendant\nset fire to his jail cell. He underwent a psychiatric examination\nand was sent to reform school, where the fights continued.\nAfter his release from reform school, the defendant married\ntwice. He has one child from his second marriage. The\ndefendant had worked for a substantial wage as a welder in\nLouisiana, and a brother described him as a “hard-working\nman.” The defendant testified he began drinking after his first\ndivorce and admitted using various drugs and flying into rages.\n\n       As to the crime itself, the defendant testified that on\nSaturday night, April 23, 1988, he was “full of it” and “well on\n[his] way” to being drunk when he left the cookout at Michael\nLucas’s home. After leaving the cookout, he drank a bottle of\nJim Beam on his way to a bar where he “got totally drunk.” He\nstated that he remembered nothing more about the night.\n\n\n                               4\n\f                                Dr. Wyatt Nichols, a clinical psychologist, testified that\n                         while the defendant was competent to stand trial and not\n                         legally insane, there were signs to indicate psychological\n                         problems. Dr. Nichols specifically mentioned the defendant’s\n                         long history of chemical dependency and multiple drug abuse.\n                         He also suggested that the defendant might have an impulse\n                         control problem which, along with the history of bedwetting,\n                         was possibly indicative of minimal neurological damage.\n                                Based on the proof, the jury found the existence of three\n                         aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, which\n                         were: (1) that the defendant had been previously convicted of\n                         violent felony offenses; (2) that the murder was especially\n                         heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or\n                         depravity of mind; and (3) that the murder was committed while\n                         the defendant was engaged in committing a felony. Tenn.\n                         Code Ann. § 39-2-203(i)(2), (5), and (7) (1982).1 In addition,\n                         the jury found that the mitigating circumstances were not\n\n\n                         sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating\n                         circumstance and as a result, sentenced the defendant to\n                         death.\n        Cazes, 875 S.W.2d at 257-59.\n\n\n                         At the post-conviction evidentiary hearing, Gloria Shettles, a private\n\n        investigator hired on behalf of the petitioner, testified that she obtained the names of\n\n        twenty-eight witnesses from the prosecutor’s original trial files. She said she located\n\n        fifteen of these witnesses and interviewed nine of them, including former employers.\n\n        Ms. Shettles testified that those interviewed were very cooperative but that they could\n        not recall some information. She said that three of the petitioner’s former employers\n\n        indicated that the petitioner was an excellent worker but that the petitioner had difficulty\n\n        getting along with coworkers and following directions. Ms. Shettles said that the\n        employers also reported that the petitioner did not take criticism well and was impatient,\n\n        emotional and impulsive. Ms. Shettles said that others told her that the petitioner was\n\n        quiet and a loner. Ms. Shettles testified as follows:\n                         A lot of these people had been, or had observed [the\n                         petitioner] when he was drinking. And so a lot of their remarks\n                         had to do with a definite change in his behavior under the\n                         influence of alcohol. And they spoke to that . . . . They talked\n                         about [the petitioner] literally being in control one minute and\n                         not being in control the next. They couldn’t give -- they were\n                         consistent in their remarks, but they couldn’t give me any basis\n                         for it, even in their opinion. That he was sitting there and was\n                         fine, and then the next minute [he] might become very angry\n                         at somebody and would act out on that anger . . . . Well,\n                         people made -- almost everyone made a remark such as, it\n                         seemed as though he had a mental problem. He might have\n\n\n1\n    The felon y murd er aggra vating circ umsta nce w as reve rsed on appea l, and the su preme court\n        found that its application was harmless.\n\n                                                               5\n\f              had a split personality. Obviously, these people aren’t experts.\n              But, in their opinion he would have a wild look, for instance,\n              after he was drinking. There was a noticeable change that\n              they could describe.\n\nMs. Shettles testified that the information she gathered from her interviews was\n\nconsistent with the information found in the police reports.\n\n\n              Dr. Pamela Auble, a clinical neuropsychologist, testified that she\n\nconducted a psychological and neuropsychological evaluation of the petitioner. Dr.\nAuble stated that before testifying at the evidentiary hearing, she reviewed a social\n\nhistory prepared by Sarah Ottinger; reports prepared by Drs. Rossby, Nurcombe and\n\nSmith; and the results of tests she administered on the petitioner, including an\nintelligence test, an achievement test in reading and writing, a memory test, two tests of\n\nmental flexibility, two language tests, two tests of motor speed and dexterity, and five\n\npersonality tests. Dr. Auble said she also interviewed the petitioner.\n\n\n              Dr. Auble testified that the petitioner was cooperative during the tests and\n\nthe interview. She also stated:\n\n              [T]here was no evidence, or no strong and conclusive\n              evidence that the memory and thinking that [the petitioner]\n              does is a lot different from what other people do. A problem\n              that would indicate or suggest that parts of his brain, you know\n              there might be holes in parts of his brain, or damage in certain\n              areas of his brain. . . . It’s known that, things like head injuries,\n              often cause emotional lack of control, impulsiveness and an\n              inability to control emotions. But, they’re also associated with\n              difficulties with memory and thinking. I didn’t really find that\n              with [the petitioner], which indicates to me that the troubles that\n              he has controlling his emotions are more likely to be the result\n              of a chemical imbalance, or something along that line, rather\n              than the results of a head injury, per se.\n\nWith regard to the personality tests, Dr. Auble testified as follows:\n              [The petitioner] is someone who tends to brood and ruminate\n              about wrongs that have been done to him. He thinks a great\n              deal. He has probably a rich internal life, that is how he kind\n              of copes with his world. He kind of retreats into fantasy or\n              thinking. The personality testing indicated that he can be\n              impulsive and he can act out under stress. He doesn’t have\n              very good emotional controls. From the personality testing [the\n              petitioner] is somebody who has a lot of difficulty relating to\n              other people. Some parts of him wants [sic] closeness, other\n              parts feel angry and rejected. He is ambivalent about both\n              women and men, and in general, I think, tries to keep people\n              at a distance. He tends to be suspicious of people. You know,\n              to believe that others would hurt him if they were given the\n              chance. There was also evidence on the personality testing of\n              confusion about sexuality, and [mother-son] relationships.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f              Regarding the petitioner’s social history, Dr. Auble testified that the\n\npetitioner is the ninth of eleven children and that until he was in his twenties, the\n\npetitioner suffered from enuresis, which caused the petitioner to urinate on himself both\nwhile asleep and awake. Dr. Auble stated that because of this condition, the petitioner\n\nwas “picked on” by his family and other children. Dr. Auble testified about physical\n\nabuse the petitioner suffered from both parents at an early age, fights he had with his\nsiblings, and discipline problems he had in school, including an attack on a teacher and\n\na principal and his inability to relate to other students, which led to expulsion from two\n\nelementary schools.\n\n\n              Dr. Auble testified that she diagnosed the petitioner with intermittent\n\nexplosive disorder, which she said is consistent with Dr. Rossby’s finding of low\nserotonin levels. With respect to serotonin, Dr. Auble stated that:\n\n              Serotonin is a neuro-transmitter. It’s one of several in the\n              brain. Neuro-transmitters have various functions. Serotonin\n              has been associated, primarily, with inhibitory functions.\n              Specifically, and probably the most relevant for this inhibitor,\n              are functions of the amygdala which is a brain structure, kind\n              of in the mid-brain limbic system. The amygdala is responsible\n              for emotional memory. Disruption of amygdala function causes\n              rage reactions. A low serotonin level would be something that\n              would decrease inhibition in the amygdala, making it more\n              likely that a rage reaction might occur.\n\nDr. Auble testified that the petitioner’s intermittent explosive disorder is “characterized\nby periods of rage, which are often triggered by fairly minor events, during which the\n\nperson has no control . . . [a]nd then, they eventually subside.” According to Dr. Auble,\n\nthe petitioner has suffered from this disorder since childhood. Dr. Auble testified that\nthis disorder could be attributed to traumatic experiences the petitioner had as a child,\n\nas well as the petitioner’s low serotonin level. Dr. Auble stated that the petitioner would\n\nsometimes enter a dissociative state, triggered by a minor event related to past\ntraumatic experiences, and afterward, the petitioner would have no memory of what\n\noccurred while he was in that state. Dr. Auble also concluded that the petitioner\n\nexhibited schizotypal personality disorder with antisocial and compulsive traits.\n\n\n\n\n              Dr. Auble testified that the petitioner’s history of alcohol and drug abuse\n\nwould contribute to lowering his serotonin levels and inhibitions. Dr. Auble testified that:\n\n                                              7\n\f               [the petitioner’s] violence towards women increased, from the\n               time he was married and coincided with the greater alcohol\n               use . . . . Yes. Certainly, a correlation, yes. An association\n               between the disinhibition of alcohol and, you know, [the\n               petitioner] has just immense amounts of underlying anger. A\n               lot of that towards women. In the context of alcohol and\n               substance abuse, in the context of relating to a woman, you\n               know, those would come together and make it more likely for\n               him to experience anger, rage, intermittent explosive disorder\n               and dissociative episodes.\n\n\n\n               Dr. Auble testified that had she been contacted before trial, she would\nhave recommended further analysis and investigation of the petitioner’s brain\n\nchemistry, specifically testing of the cerebrum spinal fluid, which would have shown the\n\nlow serotonin levels. Dr. Auble explained that “given the organic and psychological\nproblems, the history of physical and emotion [sic] abuse and neglect, the intoxication\n\nat the time, that it is . . . likelier than not that [the petitioner] was in a dissociative state\n\nand was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, unable to control\nhis behavior.”\n\n\n\n               Dr. Auble testified that she did not personally perform all the tests\n\nadministered on the petitioner during the evaluation; only reviewed a summary of the\n\ntranscript prepared by post-conviction counsel; and did not discuss the matter with Dr.\nNichols, the defense expert at trial, except for reviewing his notes and data. Dr. Auble\n\ntestified that she did not remember whether she asked the petitioner about the events\n\nsurrounding the murder or whether he was using alcohol or drugs at the time. She\ntestified, however, that she believed that another expert was supposed to focus on that\n\naspect.\n\n\n\n               Dr. Murray Smith, a specialist in internal and addiction medicine and the\n\nMedical Director of Baptist Hospital’s drug and alcohol treatment center, testified that he\n\nevaluated the petitioner both medically and in terms of addiction medicine. Dr. Smith\n\ntestified that he reviewed summaries of the trial transcript and previous medical records\nprepared by post-conviction counsel; the reports of Drs. Rossby, Auble and Nurcombe;\n\nthe social history prepared by Sarah Ottinger, and he interviewed the petitioner for\n\nabout four hours. Dr. Smith stated that he also performed blood and glucose tests on\nthe petitioner. Dr. Smith testified that the petitioner exhibited signs of hypoglycemia,\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fwhich is a significantly low blood sugar level that results in stressful, hyper-irritable and\n\nexcitable feelings. He said that adrenaline levels would increase to raise the blood\n\nsugar level. Dr. Smith further testified that alcohol, though initially raising the blood\nsugar level, would eventually lower the level. He stated that persons suffering from\n\nhypoglycemia would crave alcohol to get a “quick fuel supply.” Dr. Smith stated as\n\nfollows:\n              There’s [sic] two symptoms a person feels. One is the affect\n              of the low sugar itself. And the second is the affect of the\n              adrenaline. The affect of the low sugar itself may be the\n              feeling of confusion. A feeling like spaciness, like things aren’t\n              working well, like poor focus, poor concentration, poor\n              memory. Then the affect of the adrenaline includes increased\n              heart rate, increased breathing rate, increased blood pressure,\n              increase [sic] muscular activity with shakiness. A sense of\n              impending doom. A sense of anxiety. A sense of irritability.\n              Even some paranoia.\n\n\n              Dr. Smith testified that stress, the petitioner’s alcohol and chemical\n\ndependency, and the petitioner’s diet of “fast food type foods with a very heavy intake\n\nof Coca-Cola, regular Coca-Cola” caused the petitioner’s hypoglycemic condition. Dr.\n\nSmith believed that the petitioner inherited the brain chemistry which fostered his\n\nalcohol and chemical addiction. Dr. Smith stated that the petitioner informed him that\n\nhe experienced alcohol induced blackouts. Dr. Smith also stated that the summary of\n\nthe trial transcript indicated that other witnesses testified about the petitioner’s\n\nblackouts. Dr. Smith testified that the general opinion in his profession is that alcohol\nreleases the inhibition against violent rageful behavior rather than producing that type of\n\nbehavior. Dr. Smith testified that for people who suffer from intermittent explosive\n\ndisorder, the addition of alcohol and drug addiction “would be like pouring gasoline on a\nfire.” In addition, Dr. Smith testified that alcohol and cocaine use increases the\n\nlikelihood of the severity of hypoglycemic reactions.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Smith testified that alcohol contributes to lowering the serotonin level\n\nover time, which causes irritable and suspicious feelings, and an inability to inhibit\n\nbehavior. Dr. Smith testified that a combination of alcohol abuse, low serotonin,\n\nhypoglycemia and intermittent explosive disorder, such as he believed was present in\nthe petitioner, would prevent a person under severe emotional stress from controlling\n\nhis behavior. Dr. Smith stated that all these conditions are treatable and that treating\n\nthem would reduce the risk of uncontrollable behavior. Dr. Smith agreed with Dr.\n\n                                              9\n\fAuble’s diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder and stated that he believed the\n\npetitioner has antisocial personality disorder as well.\n\n\n\n               In response to a question about what might have triggered the petitioner’s\n\nviolent behavior on the night of the crime, Dr. Smith stated:\n\n               I can tell you what I believe. I believe that as a child [the\n               petitioner] had something very, very horrible happen to him in\n               regards to an older woman. His mother says that she will take\n               whatever it was to her grave and will not talk about it. And\n               because of dissociation, [the petitioner] cannot ever know what\n               it was. And that whatever triggered his violent, uncontrollable\n               activity that night, was triggered by something that related to\n               an older woman and that particular situation. And I may never\n               know and you may never know. And [the petitioner] certainly\n               wouldn’t know. But, I believe it happened. And I believe it\n               based on a lot of literature and based on a training program\n               that I went to in New Orleans at River Oaks Hospital. That this\n               type of thing happens . . . . It’s more than a guess. It’s an\n               educated summary of all the materials. If I took just one part\n               of it, no I couldn’t, but taking the big picture of what his mother\n               said, of his history, of his reactivity to women. The big picture\n               would suggest that this is what happened to him. And that he\n               was triggered into a dissociative state where he had absolute\n               loss of control that his functional self wasn’t there. All he was\n               was a reactive self.\n\nDr. Smith further testified that a person in a dissociative state could premeditate, i.e.,\n\nact “very clever . . . because it is survival.”\n\n\n\n               Dr. Smith stated that although he reviewed the summary of the transcript\n\nprepared by post-conviction counsel, he did not ask the petitioner any questions about\n\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding the crime. Dr. Smith testified that it was not\nnecessary to question the petitioner on this because the summary of the transcript\n\nnoted that the petitioner had no recollection of the events. He testified that in addition,\n\nthe only report of the petitioner’s intoxication on the night of the murder came from the\npetitioner himself. He said that the petitioner told him that he started drinking between\n\n3:00 and 5:00 p.m. and consumed two pints of whiskey. Dr. Smith testified that\n\nalthough the petitioner could not recall the specific events of that night, the petitioner\n\ntold him that he would normally ingest two Valium pills and several lines of cocaine and\nsmoke two to three marijuana cigarettes.\n\n\n\n               Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a psychiatry professor and the director of child and\nadolescent psychiatry at Vanderbilt University, testified that he interviewed the\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fpetitioner four or five times for a total of eleven hours. Dr. Nurcombe said he also\n\nreviewed the petitioner’s social history; a summary of the trial transcript; and reports\n\nfrom Drs. Rossby, Smith and Auble during his evaluation. Dr. Nurcombe said he did\nnot test the petitioner. Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner suffered from\n\nintermittent explosive disorder, polysubstance abuse, paranoid personality disorder,\n\nhypoglycemia and a low serotonin level. He testified that ninety-nine percent of the\nsame sex, race and age population as the petitioner have higher serotonin levels than\n\nthe petitioner. Dr. Nurcombe stated that the combination of these factors would cause\n\nthe petitioner to have difficulty controlling violent impulses. According to Dr. Nurcombe,\nthe petitioner’s capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was\n\nimpaired at the time of the offense in this case.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that research in this field since the early 1980s has\n\ndemonstrated that low serotonin levels are associated with violent impulsive behavior.\n\nHe said the research further demonstrates that recidivist offenders of violent crimes\n\ntend to have a lower serotonin level than do nonrecidivist offenders. He said that a\n\ncombination of hypoglycemia and low serotonin levels seems to be a possible indicator\n\nof recidivism. Dr. Nurcombe stated that alcohol consumption and intermittent explosive\n\ndisorder are also factors.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that individuals have certain memories that are\n\nreactivated by situations or events that remind the individual of terrifying or emotionally\n\narousing experiences from the past. He said the person will not usually remember the\npast event, but when the emotion from the past event is triggered by something in the\n\npresent, not necessarily recognized by the person, an automatic discharge of behavior,\n\nfeeling and emotion occurs. He testified that serotonin helps the individual control\nthese automatic discharges. According to Dr. Nurcombe, lower serotonin levels, like\n\nthe petitioner has, severely impair the ability to control the automatic discharges of\n\nemotion or behavior. Dr. Nurcombe stated that after reviewing the petitioner’s social\n\nhistory prepared by Ms. Ottinger, he found the following factors relevant with regard to\nthe generation of emotional memory in the petitioner:\n\n              The social history . . . did indicate a considerable degree of\n              emotional and physical abuse . . . . First of all [the petitioner]\n              was the ninth of eleven children. He was born . . . into a family\n\n                                             11\n\f              which was identified, I think, ethnically with the Cajun group in\n              Louisiana. His family was very poor. Early in their marriage\n              [the petitioner’s] parents are said to have had a turbulent\n              marriage. Although by the time he was born, this was less\n              apparent.     The parents, however, were described as\n              disengaged from each other. This was a family in which\n              affection was not expressed. And, in fact, the only emotion\n              that was expressed, and in fact, encouraged to be expressed\n              was fighting between the siblings. By the time [the petitioner]\n              was born, his mother left much of the child rearing and child\n              care to the older daughters in the family . . . . [The petitioner]\n              suffered from early childhood to the age of 21 with severe\n              problem [sic] of urinary incontinence, which involved both\n              daytime and nighttime incontinence . . . . The mother is said to\n              have been punitive towards him for this. The other siblings\n              humiliated him. His nickname at home was “piss-bug.” . . . In\n              fact, from the very first day of school he remembers being\n              separated from the classroom for having been incontinent and\n              being made to stand in a corner. And this happened frequently\n              when he was at school. And for other children rejecting him or\n              humiliating him on these grounds . . . . [The petitioner] was\n              subject from middle childhood, onward, to attacks of rage,\n              which became extremely severe by the age of 11 to 12 years.\n              As a result of his attacks of rage, of impulsive running away\n              from school, he was suspended, expelled, in fact, from two\n              schools. And had very significant difficulties in the third and\n              final school that he attended. Rage, assaults on teachers,\n              impulsive running away, provocation towards other children,\n              together with the problem of enuresis indicated that by the time\n              he reached grade five he was in serious difficulties,\n              emotionally.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner’s social history suggests that he\n\nhad low serotonin levels as a child. Dr. Nurcombe discussed the physical abuse the\n\npetitioner suffered from his parents, and he said it is significant that the petitioner has\nno memory of his mother’s physical abuse toward him. Dr. Nurcombe stated that the\n\nevidence of abuse by the petitioner’s mother was gathered from the petitioner’s\n\nsiblings. Dr. Nurcombe believed that the petitioner repressed these memories. Dr.\nNurcombe also considered significant two school reports that described the petitioner\n\nas being in a “trance” and “out of touch at times.” According to Dr. Nurcombe, these\n\nreports are consistent with a dissociative tendency.\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner abused alcohol in an effort to\n\novercome his anger toward his wives. Dr. Nurcombe explained that the more the\n\npetitioner drank, the more irritable and explosive he became because his serotonin\nlevels would eventually drop even further. Dr. Nurcombe stated that low serotonin,\n\naggravated by alcohol abuse, disinhibits and enables the release of repressed\n\nemotional memories. Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner’s hypoglycemia, in\n\n                                             12\n\fconnection with the low serotonin, intermittent explosive disorder and alcohol abuse,\n\nwould increase the petitioner’s lack of control.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that he would not necessarily have described the\n\npetitioner’s condition in the same way as Dr. Nichols. Dr. Nurcombe stated that the\n\npetitioner was in a “fugue state,” wherein the petitioner was in a continuing impulsive\nviolent rage triggered by a momentary experience. When asked whether the petitioner\n\nwould have the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, Dr.\n\nNurcombe initially responded that the petitioner’s ability to do so would be significantly\nimpaired. Upon further questioning, he stated that assuming the petitioner was\n\nintoxicated, hypoglycemic, and experiencing a low serotonin level and intermittent\n\nexplosive disorder triggered by some event, the petitioner’s ability would be so\nsignificantly impaired as to prevent the petitioner from conforming his conduct to the\n\nrequirements of the law.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Nurcombe testified that although the petitioner did not remember\n\ncommitting the murder, the petitioner did remember that he drank and took drugs earlier\n\nthat evening. Dr. Nurcombe also stated that the petitioner was convicted in Louisiana\n\nof a sexual offense about which he was able to remember the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the offense. Dr. Nurcombe testified that the ingestion of drugs and alcohol\nwere the main factors that triggered the event in the present case. Dr. Nurcombe\n\nadmitted that he could not identify any emotional trigger, but he added that the trigger\n\ncould be something minor that would not necessarily be identified by anyone else.\n\n\n              When asked by the court how an explosive disorder can be justified when\n\nthere was evidence of planning in this case, Dr. Nurcombe explained that because the\npetitioner drank so heavily and blacked out, something likely occurred during this\n\nintoxicated state to trigger the petitioner’s emotional memories. According to Dr.\n\nNurcombe, this in turn led the petitioner to act out his revenge fantasies against\n\nwomen. Dr. Nurcombe stated that although the petitioner did not inform him of any\nrevenge fantasies toward women because he is not consciously aware of them, the\n\npetitioner did describe revenge fantasies and violent reactions against people in prison\n\nwho had slighted or humiliated him. Dr. Nurcombe explained that there is some sense\n\n                                            13\n\fof primitive self-protective behavior when a person is in a “fugue state” and that the\n\nperson’s behavior in a “fugue state” is more automatic and outside conscious\n\nawareness. Finally, Dr. Nurcombe testified that the petitioner’s “plain meanness” would\nbe attributable to his mental disorders.\n\n\n\n              James Ball testified that he and Dwight Duncan were appointed to\nrepresent the petitioner after the trial court relieved the Office of the Public Defender.\n\nMr. Ball testified that he had been practicing law since 1961 and estimated that he had\n\nbeen involved in thousands of criminal cases, including several capital cases. Mr. Ball\ntestified that he assumed the case was “pretty much worked up” when he took it over\n\nbecause the capital defense team at the Public Defender’s Office had the case for\n\nabout thirteen months. Mr. Ball testified that the court appointed him to the case around\nJuly 9, 1990. He said that the trial was originally scheduled to start on September 10,\n\n1990, but they obtained a continuance until September 24, 1990. Mr. Ball further\n\ntestified that Mr. Duncan was not available to assist him until late August.\n\n\n\n              Mr. Ball testified that he did not recall whether he was familiar with the\n\nfiling of ex parte motions for expert services in capital cases. He said that Dr. Nichols\n\nevaluated the petitioner while the public defender represented him. Mr. Ball testified\n\nthat his first contact with Dr. Nichols was sometime in September and that Dr. Nichols\nsuggested the possibility that the petitioner suffered from an organic brain impairment,\n\nwhich severely limited his ability to control his impulses when angry. Mr. Ball testified\n\nthat Mr. Duncan filed a motion for additional support services on September 29, 1990,\nupon receiving a letter from Dr. Nichols on September 28, 1990, explaining that the\n\npetitioner might be suffering from an organic brain disorder. Mr. Ball testified that they\n\nwanted an M.R.I. and a Q-beam performed on the petitioner. He said that they filed the\nmotion during the guilt phase of trial, and the trial court denied it.\n\n\n\n              Mr. Ball testified that he received discovery from the state but that he did\n\nnot receive the police reports from the case. Mr. Ball also testified that both Mr. Duncan\nand the public defender requested the petitioner’s school records from Louisiana but\n\nnever received them. Mr. Ball testified that he personally traveled to Louisiana and met\n\nwith the petitioner’s family for several hours but that they were not very cooperative. He\n\n                                              14\n\fsaid he asked to talk to the petitioner’s mother, but the family refused because they did\n\nnot want her to be involved. Mr. Ball testified that although he attempted to have the\n\nentire family testify during the sentencing phase, only two of the petitioner’s brothers\nappeared. Mr. Ball said he did not meet with any of the petitioner’s former teachers or\n\nprincipals. However, he said he knew that the petitioner had a troubled childhood,\n\nincluding problems in school. Mr. Ball said that from conversations with the petitioner\nand some of his acquaintances, he discovered that the petitioner abused drugs and\n\nalcohol. He said he reviewed the petitioner’s social history prepared for the post-\n\nconviction hearing and testified that the information would have been helpful to the\ndefense at trial. However, he stated that during sentencing, testimony revealed facts\n\nabout the petitioner’s childhood and alcohol and drug abuse, as well as his possible\n\nneurological problems.\n\n\n              Mr. Ball testified that he met with the petitioner often before trial and was\n\nable to carry on intelligent conversations about the proof and available defenses. He\n\nsaid he believed that the petitioner was competent to assist in his defense. Mr. Ball\n\nsaid he never considered the petitioner to be out of touch with reality during the trial.\n\nHe said he knew that the petitioner was taking antipsychotic drugs while in jail. He\n\nstated that the most damaging evidence against the petitioner at trial was\n\ncircumstantial: the fingerprints at the scene and the bite marks on the victim. Mr. Ball\nsaid that the state apparently lost one of the fingerprints taken from the screen in front\n\nof the victim’s house. Mr. Ball testified that he and Mr. Duncan defended on the merits\n\nof the case, meaning they made the state prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt\nbecause “that’s what [he] thought needed to be done.” Mr. Ball stated that the\n\npetitioner had been to the victim’s residence before because he was a friend of her\n\ngrandson. He said that he and Mr. Duncan filed a motion on August 29, 1990, for\nexpert services to assist in rebutting the state’s experts on the fingerprints, the bite\n\nmarks, and the chipping hammer, but the motion was denied. Mr. Ball testified that\n\nthey fully discussed the case with the petitioner and that the petitioner did not object to\n\nthe trial strategy. Mr. Ball testified that the petitioner was not in favor of an insanity\ndefense. He said the decision to forgo an insanity defense was made before Dr.\n\nNichols sent him the letter suggesting that more testing might be helpful. Mr. Ball\n\ntestified that Dr. Nichols examined the petitioner before trial and that Dr. Nichols stated\n\n                                              15\n\fthat he believed the petitioner was competent and legally sane at the time of the\n\noffense.\n\n\n\n              Judge James C. Beasley, Jr., former Assistant District Attorney General,\n\ntestified that he helped prosecute the petitioner’s case. Judge Beasley testified that he\n\ngave defense counsel a copy of his entire file when they were appointed to represent\nthe petitioner. Judge Beasley testified that this was not his normal procedure but\n\nbecause petitioner’s counsel were appointed after the public defender was relieved\n\nprior to trial, he gave new counsel everything he had, except possibly the police reports.\nJudge Beasley recounted the mitigation proof presented by the defense, including the\n\npetitioner’s own testimony, as follows:\n\n                       It was -- I mean, I think you would have to be very cold\n              not to have been moved by it. Even though I was the\n              prosecutor and even though I was seeking the death penalty,\n              I felt it was moving testimony. And I think I was concerned,\n              especially when the jury stayed out in the sentencing phase for\n              five or six hours, two or three times longer than they had in the\n              guilt phase. It concerned me greatly that they may be being\n              swayed by this proof that he had put on.\n\n\n\n              Judge Beasley testified that the state questioned the petitioner on cross-\n\nexamination about the events on the night of the murder but that the petitioner testified\nthat he did not recall anything about the offense. Judge Beasley testified that the jury\n\nappeared to be very emotional when they returned with their verdict. Judge Beasley\n\ntestified that even if the defense had offered expert testimony during the guilt phase\nsuggesting that the crime was impulsive, he still would have argued to the jury that the\n\npetitioner planned his actions and acted with premeditation.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Daniel A. Martell, a forensic neuropsychologist, testified that forensic\n\nneuropsychology encompasses the study of brain damage and its effects on human\n\nbehavior as it relates to the law. Dr. Martell stated that before his two-day evaluation of\n\nthe petitioner, he reviewed the post-conviction testimony of the petitioner’s experts, the\npetitioner’s prison records, the police reports, and selected portions of the trial transcript\n\nand the medical records of the petitioner’s mother. Dr. Martell said he interviewed the\n\npetitioner and administered several tests, including memory tests; a language test; a\npsychological disassociation test; a battery of tests to detect malingering; tests\n\n\n                                             16\n\fmeasuring psychopathy, antisocial behaviors and substance abuse; and the MMPI\n\npsychological personality test.\n\n\n\n             Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner has low serotonin and\n\nhypoglycemia. However, he also testified that:\n\n             the research that attempted to link low serotonin to violent\n             behavior I think is -- has been over represented to the Court,\n             the strength of that association. A careful reading of the\n             literature indicates that it’s not tied to violent behavior per se,\n             but rather is tied to impulsive behavior, of which violence or\n             aggression is sometimes a subset.\n\n                   A careful examination of the trial record indicates that\n             Mr. Cazes’s behavior in conducting the crime was not\n             impulsive. And the finding from the research is that low\n             serotonin is related to impulsive criminal offending.\n\n                     In fact, when you look at the criteria for the research\n              groups, people were determined not to be impulsive if, number\n              one, they knew the victim, which Mr. Cazes did in this case;\n              and number two, if there was evidence of premeditation in the\n              conduct of the violent crime. And I believe a reading of the\n              record indicates that there was that level of premeditation, of\n              non-impulsive, planned, goal-oriented behavior, and I’m\n              prepared to give the Court my impression from reading the trial\n              record of evidence of that lack of impulsivity.\n\n              ....\n\n                     The first issue is the fact that he selected a victim that\n              was known to him, which, as I mentioned from the research\n              studies, would be rule-out [sic] for impulsivity.\n\n                      In addition, upon arriving at her residence, he obtained\n              a chipping hammer, which I understand to be a welder’s tool,\n              from his car, which he used both in attempting to gain entry to\n              her residence as well as in the assault on Ms. Skinner. The\n              fact that he had the foresight to plan ahead and obtain this tool\n              to help him indicates that he was not behaving in an impulsive\n              way, but rather in a goal-oriented way. He appreciated the\n              nature and consequences of what he wanted to do, i.e., obtain\n              entry into her locked house and gain access to her, and it also\n              indicates an ability to control his behavior. He didn’t go\n              rushing out of his car and banging on the door or smashing out\n              the window. He was careful in taking a tool with him to\n              perpetrate the crime.\n                      The fact that he unscrewed the light bulb illuminating\n              the backyard is further indication that he knew what he was\n              doing or what he wanted to do was wrong and that he wanted\n              to reduce his risk of detection by reducing the illumination in\n              that situation. So it’s purposeful behavior directed at avoiding\n              detection of his behavior. Again, that is not impulsive. He\n              didn’t go cracking at the door and smashing out the window\n              until he reduced his risk.\n\n                     There’s evidence at the back door of evidence of trying\n              to -- of pry marks to open that door. Failing . . . for some\n              reason at being able to do that, whether it was making too\n              much noise or he couldn’t get the door open, I don’t know, but\n\n                                             17\n\ffor some reason he abandoned that effort, he then was able to\nplan an alternative strategy. He was able to shift from trying to\ngain entry through the back of the house and go around to the\nfront of the house, where he may have attempted to gain entry\nthrough the front door, which had an iron gate on it, and\nultimately selected an accessible window as his mode of entry.\n\n       The ability to shift your behavior, to start in on one plan\nof attack, meet an impediment and then have the problem\nsolving ability to avoid that and go around and find another\nway to get in again is evidence that it’s not impulsive. This is\nfocused, goal-oriented behavior, aimed at obtaining a specific\nreward; that is, getting access into her secured home and\ngaining access to her.\n       Even upon selecting the window he still had to deal with\nthe screens that had been installed there and had to remove\nthe screens. Again his dogged pursuit of his goal of gaining\nentry into the house at whatever means necessary, mangling\nthe screen, breaking out the window, all of these things are not\nimpulsive, but instead are planned, focused, goal-oriented\nbehaviors.\n\n       Once inside the house, the evidence indicates that he\ncentered his behavior on the victim’s bedroom where she was.\nHe is not elsewhere in the house breaking into things.\nEverything is focused where the scene of the sexual assault\ntakes place.\n\n       Upon encountering Ms. Skinner, he subdued her with\nblows to her head and body with the chipping hammer. This\nwas to render her compliant to his wishes, to reduce her ability\nto call the police or to scream or to call for help. This is\nbehavior that’s very characteristic of sexual homicide offenders\nas they have been profiled by the FBI’s Behavioral Science\nUnit and as they’ve published about the behavior of individuals\nwho do this. This is very typical behavior of sexual homicide\noffenders to use this kind of blitz attack on the victim to subdue\nthem and to get them to cooperate with their wishes.\n       Again, this is not impulsive behavior. This is purposeful,\ngoal-directed behavior in order to permit him to accomplish the\nsexual act that he has come there to do.\n\n       In addition, after subduing her, he engages in sexual\nbehaviors that are particularly pleasing to him, including biting\nthe victim in certain places and posing her body in sexual\npositions that he found arousing and that were his favorite\npositions to do that. Again, this is practiced and purposeful\nbehavior for his own sexual gratification, not impulsive\nbehavior driven by some biochemical imbalance.\n       Following the assault, the evidence indicates that he\nransacked her bedroom, pulling things out of the drawers,\nstaging the crime scene to perhaps appear as if a robbery had\noccurred. Again, this kind of staging of the crime scene is not\nimpulsive behavior, but rather is purposeful, goal-directed\nbehavior, intended to misdirect investigators who come on to\nthe scene and make them think that there was some other goal\nin mind during the course of the assault.\n\n        This type of forensic behavioral analysis to me indicates\nthat this was not an impulsive crime, but rather was purposeful,\nfocused, goal-directed, planned behavior, and that would be\ninconsistent with the research literature on glucose metabolism\n\n                               18\n\f              and low serotonin that suggests that some of these offenders\n              will engage in aggressive behavior that is impulsive.\n\n\n              Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner met the criteria for conduct disorder\n\nin childhood and antisocial personality behavior as an adult, but he testified that he\ndisagreed with the diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder because this disorder is\n\ncharacterized by sudden, unexpected rage attacks that must occur outside the context\n\nof other specific mental disorders, including intoxication. Dr. Martell testified that\naccording to the petitioner’s history, the petitioner’s rage occurred only when he was\n\nintoxicated. Dr. Martell also disagreed that the crime was committed while the\n\npetitioner was in a dissociative mental state. He said that during his evaluation of the\npetitioner, the petitioner informed him that he had about twenty blackout spells after\n\nwhich he would not remember anything and that they all occurred while he was abusing\n\neither drugs or alcohol. According to Dr. Martell, the diagnosis of a dissociative\ndisorder cannot be made if the disorder only occurs during a state of intoxication. Dr.\n\nMartell said that in addition, the petitioner scored below the cutoff for dissociation on the\n\ntest he administered. Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner never engaged in a violent\n\nact during any of the other blackouts he experienced and that the petitioner did not\n\nclaim to have amnesia during previous violent acts. Dr. Martell said that this indicates\nthat the petitioner was not in a dissociative state at the time of the crime.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Martell testified that contrary to Dr. Auble’s findings, he did not find\nany evidence of neuropsychological impairment. Dr. Martell opined that the petitioner\n\nwas not giving his best efforts on the neuropsychological tests administered by Dr.\n\nAuble. Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner exaggerated his responses on some of\nthe personality tests administered by Dr. Auble, which could have caused her to\n\nmisinterpret the results. Dr. Martell testified that the petitioner was “emotionally labile,\n\nthat he’s demanding, that he can be hostile and irritable and evasive and suspicious\n\nand distrustful.”\n\n\n              Dr. Martell testified that he reviewed Dr. Nichols’ recommendation that the\n\npetitioner undergo further neurological evaluation and stated that even if further\nevaluation had been performed before trial, the results would not have supported an\n\n\n                                             19\n\finsanity defense. Dr. Martell stated:\n\n                     I think even if it had led to the full examination that has\n              been done in the last year or two, because of the reasons I’ve\n              outlined for the Court this morning, none of these factors would\n              have been relevant to his mental state.\n\n                     Serotonin doesn’t matter because the crime was not\n              impulsive. He doesn’t meet criteria for intermittent explosive\n              disorder or dissociation. He is an antisocial character. And\n              even if this additional testing were done, we’d be at the same\n              point that we are today, that it wouldn’t support it.\n\n                     Dr. Nichols was the defense doctor, and he himself felt\n              that he was not insane. He thought it would be nice to know\n              more about his neuropsychological status, but even if we had\n              pursued that at that -- if the Court had pursued that or the\n              defense had pursued that at the time and it yielded the findings\n              that we have today, it still wouldn’t have contributed to his\n              defense or to mitigation evidence.\n\n\n              Dr. Martell admitted that he used his own method instead of an official\n\ncomputer program from National Computer Systems in scoring some of the tests\nadministered to the petitioner. Dr. Martell also admitted that more than one published\n\nauthority exists regarding the results of some of the psychological tests administered.\n\nThe petitioner’s attorney attempted to discredit Dr. Martell’s conclusions. For example,\n\nafter citing to one of the authorities upon which Dr. Martell relied that stated that a\n\ndisorganized crime scene suggests an impulsive crime, the attorney asked Dr. Martell\nhow he concluded that the petitioner acted with purpose when the victim’s bedroom\n\nwas in such disarray. Dr. Martell supported his conclusion with the fact that the\n\npetitioner tried to deter detection by unscrewing the light bulb above the back door and\nby trying to pry the door open rather than kicking it open. Dr. Martell explained that the\n\npetitioner may have left the crime scene in disarray to mislead the police about the\n\npurpose of the crime. Regarding the petitioner’s low serotonin level, alcohol abuse, and\nhypoglycemia, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n              ATTORNEY: So those three factors in combination are good\n              predictors of the likelihood of violent impulsive behavior?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: Of impulsive violent behavior, that’s correct.\n\n              ATTORNEY: That’s correct. And Mr. Cazes has all three of\n              those factors in evidence, does he not?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: He has the factors, but in committing this\n              crime he was not impulsive.\n\n              ATTORNEY: Well, again that goes to your definition of impulsivity.\n\n              ....\n\n                                             20\n\f              DR. MARTELL: This is based on an analysis of his behavior\n              as he conducted the crimes.\n              ATTORNEY: According to your notion of impulsivity?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: It is my opinion. That’s correct.\n\nRegarding the petitioner’s treatment with Prozac while in prison, the following colloquy\noccurred:\n\n              ATTORNEY: And you asked him about how it had affected him,\n              correct?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: I did.\n\n              ATTORNEY: And he responded that it had calmed him down?\n              DR. MARTELL: He did.\n\n              ATTORNEY: Isn’t that in itself corroborative of the behavioral effects\n              of low serotonin in Mr. Cazes?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: No, it is not, and let me tell you why. Mr.\n              Cazes, during the period of time when he was being treated\n              with Prozac, he had historically refused any treatment or\n              contact until these proceedings and Dr. Nurcombe’s diagnosis\n              and the serotonin findings, at which time he did agree to take\n              the Prozac. And he reports he felt better, and there is actually\n              a note in the chart that said there was some improvement in\n              his behavior.\n\n                 However, at the same time that he was taking the Prozac\n              he had at least two incidents where he flung feces on\n              correctional officers during the time when he is being treated.\n              And then he later refused to take the medication and continued\n              to have this kind of behavior, not necessarily the throwing\n              feces, but acting out to the point where he had to be put in the\n              administrative segregation.\n                 And it’s also a consistent pattern with his prior disciplinary\n              history in the institution. So that to me shows that there’s no\n              correlation between the Prozac treatment and his impulsive\n              acting-out kind of behavior. I think it reflects antisocial\n              personality, not serotonin depletion.\n              COURT: You’re saying he felt better but he didn’t act any better?\n\n              DR. MARTELL: That’s correct, sir.\n              Dr. Auble was recalled and testified that she and Dr. Martell disagreed on\n\nwhether the petitioner had intermittent explosive disorder, whether impulsive behavior\n\ncan be purposeful and whether evidence of low serotonin, hypoglycemia and the\n\nfindings in the petitioner’s social history are significant mitigating factors. Dr. Auble\ntestified that the petitioner could have acted “purposefully in the grip of an emotional\n\nimpulse,” similar to the actions of people with impulse control disorders like pyromania,\n\nkleptomania and pathological gambling. According to Dr. Auble, the crime in this case\nwas the product of an emotional impulse with low serotonin, intoxication and\n\n\n                                             21\n\fhypoglycemia contributing to impair the petitioner’s inhibition of the emotional impulse.\n\n\n\n              Dr. Auble could not describe or identify any triggering event that caused\nthe petitioner to retreat to this emotional state. She testified that she and Dr. Martell\n\nalso disagreed about what personality disorder the petitioner has. She said Dr. Martell\n\nbelieves the petitioner has antisocial personality disorder, whereas she believes he has\nintermittent explosive disorder. Dr. Auble testified that the petitioner’s aggressive\n\noutbursts did not occur only when the petitioner was intoxicated. She also testified that\n\nthe petitioner could have been in a dissociative state while intoxicated. However, Dr.\nAuble said she could not identify any time during which the petitioner claimed to\n\nblackout while not intoxicated. After reviewing some of the physical exhibits from the\n\noriginal trial, Dr. Auble testified that the verbal description of the crime scene she\nreceived was sufficient for her to form an opinion about the impulsive nature of the\n\ncrime without having viewed the exhibits. Based upon the foregoing proof, the trial\n\ncourt denied the post-conviction petition.\n\n\n\n              Under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act in effect at the time the\n\npetitioner filed his petition, the petitioner has the burden of proving the allegations in his\n\npetition by a preponderance of the evidence.

RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT\n\n              The petitioner contends that the trial judge conducting the post-conviction\n\nevidentiary hearing erred by denying the petitioner’s motions to recuse the judge and to\nhave the case reassigned to the division of the trial court to which it was originally\n\nassigned. The state contends that the issues are not properly before this court\n\nbecause they have been previously determined against the petitioner. Alternatively, the\n\n                                             22\n\fstate contends that the trial court properly denied the petitioner’s motions.\n\n\n\n              Initially, we address the state’s contention that the issues were previously\ndetermined against the petitioner. The state claims that the law of the case doctrine\n\nprecludes reconsideration of these issues on direct appeal because the petitioner\n\npreviously sought and was denied extraordinary review of these issues pursuant to\nT.R.A.P. 10. The grant of a T.R.A.P. 10 application is conditioned upon a showing by\n\nthe appellant that “the lower court has so far departed from the accepted and usual\n\ncourse of judicial proceedings as to require immediate review” or that immediate review\nis necessary for complete determination of the action on appeal. If these requirements\n\nare not met, the application for permission to appeal is denied. However, this court\n\ndoes not necessarily reach the merits of the particular claims raised when it denies a\nT.R.A.P. 10 application. Instead, the court decides whether the claims raised must be\n\naddressed in an interlocutory or extraordinary fashion rather than subsequently on\n\ndirect appeal. In the present case, the court concluded that immediate, interlocutory\n\nreview was not necessary. Although the court’s order refers to the particular issues\n\nraised, the court did not fully address the merits of the underlying claims. Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude that these issues were not previously addressed and are now properly\n\nbefore us. See, e.g., State v. Ruane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1676392\"><a href=\"/opinion/1676392/state-v-ruane/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 773-77 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995)\n\n(addressing the merits on direct appeal even though the appellant’s T.R.A.P. 10\napplication was denied and the order of denial referred to the underlying issue raised).\n\n\n\n                                  A. Motion to Recuse\n              The petitioner contends that because the trial court judge was employed\n\nby the Office of the District Attorney General during the prosecution of the petitioner on\n\nan earlier, separate matter, thereby giving the appearance of partiality, the judge should\nhave recused himself. The state contends that the trial court did not err by denying the\n\npetitioner’s motion. We note that the trial court has discretion in determining whether to\n\ngrant a motion to recuse. The court’s decision will not be reversed on appeal unless\n\nthe face of the record reveals clear abuse. State v.

Sup. Ct. R., provides as follows:\n\n                                            23\n\f              A judge shall disqualify himself . . . in a proceeding in which\n              the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\n              including but not limited to instances where:\n\n              (a) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a\n              party or a party’s lawyer, or personal knowledge of disputed\n              evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;\n\n              (b) the judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy,\n              or a lawyer with whom the judge previously practiced law\n              served during such association as a lawyer concerning the\n              matter, or the judge has been a material witness concerning it.\n\nThe commentary to this section provides:\n              A lawyer in a government agency does not ordinarily have an\n              association with other lawyers employed by that agency within\n              the meaning of Section E(1)(b); a judge formerly employed by\n              a government agency, however, should disqualify himself . . .\n\n              in a proceeding if the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be\n              questioned because of such association.\n\n\n\n              We hold that the petitioner has not demonstrated that the trial court\nabused its discretion in denying the motion to recuse. The record reflects that although\n\nthe trial judge was present in the courtroom during a hearing in a previous proceeding\n\ninvolving the petitioner, the judge stated that he merely received a copy of a motion\n\nfiled by defense counsel because the prosecutor handling the matter was unavailable at\n\nthe time. While the judge’s name appears on the cover of the transcript in the earlier\nproceeding, no other mention of the judge’s participation in the earlier proceeding\n\nexists. Moreover, the judge stated that he did not remember or know anything about\n\nthe petitioner or his cases.\n\n\n              Nothing in the record before us suggests that the trial judge’s impartiality\n\ncould reasonably be questioned. The judge sufficiently explained why his name\nappeared on the cover of the transcript from the earlier proceeding involving the\n\npetitioner. Although the petitioner claims that the trial court’s bias against him is\n\nevidenced by the denial of the petitioner’s claims, adverse rulings by a court are\n\ngenerally insufficient grounds to establish bias.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2465218\"><a href=\"/opinion/2465218/alley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 820\n\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1994). The record is devoid of any suggestion that the trial judge\n\ndemonstrated antagonism toward the petitioner or expressed any opinion about the\n\nmerits of the proceeding before the hearing. See Id. at 821-22.\n\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f                                  B. Motion to Reassign\n\n              The petitioner contends that his petition was transferred from one division\n\nof the trial court to another in violation of local court rules and that the trial court should\nhave granted his motion to reassign the petition to the court in which it was originally\n\nfiled. The state contends that the trial court properly denied the motion.\n\n\n\n              Initially, we note that some discrepancy exists as to which court the\n\npetition was originally assigned. The petitioner suggests that the petition was originally\n\nassigned to Division IX of the Shelby County Criminal Court. However, the court\nrecords reflect that the petition was filed in Division VII but that the trial judge in Division\n\nVII had a conflict with the petitioner and asked Judge Craft of Division VIII to hear the\n\nmatter. The record shows that Judge Craft agreed, and the petition was heard in\nDivision VIII, the same division in which the original trial was conducted. However, the\n\ntrial judge who presided over the trial in Division VIII retired before the petitioner filed\n\nthe present petition.\n\n\n\n              Rule 4.03 of the Shelby County Criminal Court Rules requires that a\n\nwritten order of transfer be filed to transfer a case from one division to another. The\n\nrecord in the present case contains no written order of transfer. However, Rule 4.05\n\nprovides that “[t]he judges may transfer cases among themselves by mutual consent”\nwithout the consent of the parties or counsel. Our reading of the record shows that this\n\nis what occurred in the present case. Obviously, the better practice would have been\n\nfor a written order to have been filed. However, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate\nthat he was prejudiced by the lack of a written order. See T.R.A.P. 36(b).\n\n\n\n                     II. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n              The petitioner contends that his trial attorneys were ineffective at both the\n\nguilt and sentencing phases of the trial. Specifically, the petitioner argues that his\n\nattorneys failed to conduct an adequate investigation into his background, including his\n\nmental and physical conditions. He argues that the attorneys’ deficient performance\nprecluded the jury from considering possible defenses during the guilt phase and\n\nimportant mitigating evidence during sentencing. The state contends that the petitioner\n\nreceived the effective assistance of counsel.\n\n                                              25\n\f              Under the Sixth Amendment, when a claim of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel is made, the burden is upon the petitioner to show (1) that counsel’s\n\nperformance was deficient and (2) that the deficiency was prejudicial in terms of\nrendering a reasonable probability that the result of the trial was unreliable or the\n\nproceedings fundamentally unfair.

In light of Henley and Taylor, we reject the petitioner’s claim that our\n\nreview should be de novo.\n\n\n              We are aware, however, that the Tennessee Supreme Court recently\n\nused a de novo review standard in a direct appeal of a conviction when the issue of the\n\neffective assistance of counsel was presented. See State v. Brenda Ann Burns, No.\nW1996-00004-SC-R11-CD, Henry County, slip op. at 12 (Tenn. Nov. 8, 1999) (for\n\npublication). Given the summary fashion in which the court addressed the standard of\n\nreview in Burns, we seriously doubt that it intended to overrule Henley and thirty years\n\nof similar post-conviction jurisprudence.

Guilt Phase–Failure to Investigate\n\n              The petitioner contends that his trial attorneys were ineffective during the\nguilt phase of his trial because they failed to investigate the petitioner’s low serotonin\n\nand blood sugar levels and to explore a possible insanity defense. He argues that his\n\nattorneys were ineffective by defending the case solely “on the merits.” The state\ncontends that the trial court correctly found that the petitioner received the effective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n\n\n               The trial court found that the petitioner’s attorneys rendered effective\n\nassistance, making the following findings and conclusions:\n\n              Petitioner was examined twice at the request of his attorneys\n              by a competent forensic psychologist, Dr. Wyatt Nichols, who\n              would not support a defense of insanity. Although not called\n              by either side at the hearing on this petition, Dr. Nichols\n              testified at petitioner’s trial that at the time of the trial he had\n              been practicing clinical psychology for eleven or twelve years,\n              with specialized training in forensic psychology. The State\n              stipulated to his qualifications, and he was accepted by the trial\n              court as an expert in the field of forensic psychology.

Dr. Nichols testified at petitioner’s trial\n              that\n\n                     A. . . . . It was my opinion that [petitioner] was\n                     not criminally insane and did not appear to me to\n                     suffer from a mental illness that was sufficient for\n                     me to be concerned.\n                             Sometimes people who are really\n                     severely mentally ill will say they didn’t do it, but\n                     in fact they may have and there’s a real severe\n                     illness there that will interfere with their ability to\n                     communicate. But I did not see that. So it was\n                     my final opinion that he failed the Graham Vs.\n                     State test, and so basically he was criminally\n                     responsible.\n\n\n                     Q. Does that mean that he -- that you didn’t see\n                     any psychological problems at all?\n\n                     A. No. It doesn’t mean that. It just means that\n                     he didn’t meet the Graham Vs. State criteria that\n                     I mentioned earlier as far as a mental illness.\n\n              There was no indication at the time of petitioner’s trial that Dr.\n\n                                              28\n\f              Nichols’ opinion was in any way impeachable, and the\n              attorneys therefore had no “specialized need” for further\n              evaluation that they could have given the trial court on the\n              issue of an insanity defense during the guilt phase . . . .\n\n                      Mr. Ball . . . testified that in his experience, insanity\n              defenses aren’t very successful, and that he would have to\n              basically admit to the murder, but say petitioner was not legally\n              responsible for it. On redirect, he testified that even though he\n              had no expert proof to rebut the fingerprint evidence, the proof\n              at the trial was that petitioner had been at the victim’s house\n              before, having known the victim and having hung around with\n              her grandson. (The garage petitioner worked at was owned by\n              Mike Lucas, the employer, friend and drug partner of petitioner.\n              He was also the step-grandson of Ms. Skinner.) Mr. Ball felt\n              the case could have been won.\n\n                      . . . . Eliminating the “distorting effect of hindsight, to\n              reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged\n              conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s\n              perspective at the time,” Strickland at 689 and Hellard at 9, it\n              would have been extremely risky to have attempted a defense\n              of insanity, in light of the entirely circumstantial proof offered,\n              even if an expert witness who would support an insanity\n              defense could have been found, knowing that Dr. Nichols in\n              that event would then be called as a state’s witness against the\n              petitioner.\n\n                     This Court finds that not only were petitioner’s attorneys\n              not deficient in their performance during the guilt phase on the\n              issue of insanity, but that there has also been no showing of\n              prejudice to petitioner.\n\n              ....\n\n                     Petitioner has completely failed to carry his burden of\n              proving that his attorneys 1) should have known to file a\n              motion for additional psychological assistance on the issue of\n              insanity, 2) that his attorneys could have shown a specialized\n              need for that assistance, if requested, 3) that the expert\n              assistance, had it been granted, would have revealed a\n              chemical imbalance in petitioner’s system, and 4) if it had, that\n              a viable theory of [insanity] could have been made out to the\n              jury that would have been better than the defense actually\n              tried. Petitioner has not shown that there is a reasonable\n              probability (a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\n              the outcome) that but for counsel’s not asking for additional\n              psychological assistance, the result of the guilt phase would\n              have been different. Strickland, at 694. Petitioner has not\n              established either prong of the Strickland test, either deficiency\n              or prejudice, in the guilt phase, and therefore this allegation is\n              without merit.\n\n\n\n              We hold that the petitioner has failed to establish that the record\npreponderates against the trial court’s findings. Mr. Ball testified that the petitioner\n\ncould carry on intelligent conversations and that the petitioner did not act out of touch\n\nwith reality. Mr. Ball further testified that the petitioner did not want to pursue an\ninsanity defense. The petitioner was examined twice by Dr. Nichols, and although he\n\n\n                                             29\n\frecommended further testing to discover the extent of the petitioner’s mental condition,\n\nhe stated that his findings would not support an insanity defense. Thus, the petitioner\n\nhas not shown that his attorneys would have been able to demonstrate a specialized\nneed for further evaluation of the petitioner to pursue an insanity defense.\n\n\n\n       B. Sentencing Phase–Failure to Investigate and Request Expert Services\n          The petitioner contends that his attorneys were ineffective during the\n\nsentencing phase of trial. He argues that the attorneys failed to investigate fully the\n\npetitioner’s background and failed to seek expert mental services for mitigation until the\ntrial had already begun. The petitioner argues that the jury might have returned a life\n\nsentence if it was presented with the evidence regarding the petitioner’s low serotonin\n\nlevel, hypoglycemia and alcohol addiction, as well as more detailed information about\nthe petitioner’s tumultuous relationship with his family, particularly his mother. The\n\nstate contends that the attorneys were not deficient and that the petitioner has failed to\n\ndemonstrate prejudice. Regarding the presentation of mitigating evidence during the\n\ncapital cases, our supreme court has stated as follows:\n\n                     Where the alleged prejudice under Strickland involves\n              counsel’s failure to present mitigating evidence in the penalty\n              phase of a capital trial, several factors are significant. First,\n              courts have analyzed the nature and extent of the mitigating\n              evidence that was available but not presented. Second, courts\n              have considered whether substantially similar mitigating\n              evidence was presented to the jury in either the guilt or penalty\n              phase of the proceedings. Finally, the courts have considered\n              whether there was such strong evidence of aggravating factors\n              that the mitigating evidence would not have affected the jury’s\n              determination.\n\nGoad v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (Tenn. 1990) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n              First, we will address the petitioner’s contention that his attorneys were\n\nineffective for failing to conduct further investigation into his social background for\nmitigation evidence at the sentencing phase. We believe that the petitioner has\n\ndemonstrated neither deficiency nor prejudice. With respect to the attorneys’ failure to\n\nsecure the petitioner’s school records, Mr. Ball testified that both he and the public\n\ndefender requested but never received the materials. Mr. Ball testified that he went to\nLouisiana and spoke with the petitioner’s family but that he was not allowed access to\n\nthe petitioner’s mother. He testified that during his interviews with the petitioner’s father\n\nand brothers, he learned that the petitioner was severely abused as a child. Defense\n\n                                             30\n\fcounsel presented this evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial, along with\n\nevidence of the petitioner’s enuresis and the problems associated with it and the\n\npetitioner’s abuse of alcohol and drugs. The trial court’s order denying post-conviction\nrelief states the following:\n\n              This brief summary of the high points in the mitigation\n              evidence presented in petitioner’s trial does not adequately\n              reflect the quality or extent of the proof offered. Altogether,\n              petitioner presented 167 pages of transcript in mitigation\n              during the sentencing phase. Much of it was highly emotional,\n              and even from a cold reading of the transcript seven years\n              later this Court was moved by petitioner’s account, and his\n              brothers’ accounts, of his tragic childhood.\n\nThe petitioner has failed to show that his attorneys did not adequately investigate and\n\npresent his social history, nor has he shown a reasonable probability that, had they\nperformed further investigation, the outcome of the sentencing phase would have been\n\ndifferent.\n\n\n\n              With respect to the petitioner’s contention that his attorneys were\n\nineffective for failing to request expert mental services for mitigation until after the trial\n\nhad started, the trial court found that the attorneys were deficient. The trial court stated\n\nthat because Dr. Nichols suggested additional neurological testing to explore the\n\npetitioner’s mental condition, the trial judge “would most likely have given the attorneys\nfunds for this neurological workup and also a continuance to obtain it.” However, the\n\ntrial court found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice. The trial court\n\ndetermined that all of the proof raised at the evidentiary hearing was presented at the\nmitigation hearing, except for the evidence of the petitioner’s hypoglycemia, low\n\nserotonin, and the effects of the two when combined with alcohol and drugs. The trial\n\ncourt determined that even if the petitioner had been further evaluated, it is unlikely that\nhis serotonin and glucose levels would have been tested. The trial court found that\n\nsubstantially similar mitigating evidence was presented at trial in that Dr. Nichols\n\ntestified that the petitioner may have had an organic brain impairment that interfered\n\nwith his ability to control urges. Finally, the trial court determined that the strong\nevidence of other aggravating factors shows that the mitigating evidence would not\n\nhave affected the jury’s determination. See Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 371.\n\n\n\n              The record supports the trial court’s finding of deficient performance. The\n\n\n                                              31\n\fpetitioner’s attorneys originally made an ex parte motion for expert services that was\n\ndenied for failure to comply with Rule 13, § 2(B)(10), Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. Then, in what\n\nthe trial court characterized as a last ditch effort to secure expert services, the attorneys\npresented a letter from Dr. Nichols to support their specialized need for evaluation, and\n\nthey requested a continuance in order to conduct the evaluation. However, they did not\n\npresent the letter until the fifth day of trial. As the trial court stated in its order denying\nthe post-conviction petition, “[w]hen proof of a specialized need is not obtained until the\n\nfifth day of trial, however, there is not much likelihood that a continuance will be\n\ngranted.” The petitioners have provided no reason why this letter or an affidavit from\nDr. Nichols was not presented before trial. Failure to investigate, follow up, and present\n\nevidence of a history of mental problems for use at the sentencing phase of a capital\n\ncase is deficient performance. Cooper v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2388301\"><a href=\"/opinion/2388301/cooper-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530-32 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992).\n\n\n\n              Despite the attorneys’ deficiency, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate\n\nthat the record preponderates against the trial court’s determination of no prejudice.\n\nMost significant is the fact that the petitioner has not shown that if the evaluation\n\nsuggested by Dr. Nichols had been performed, evidence of the petitioner’s\n\nhypoglycemia or low serotonin would have been discovered. The trial court found as\n\nfollows:\n              [A]t the time of petitioner’s trial in 1990, the “low serotonin”\n              defense and the “low blood sugar” defense were relatively\n              unknown. There were only three significant articles\n              produced by petitioner that had been published in this area\n              in scientific journals. . . . It is clear that the relationship\n              between serotonin and impulsive behavior was not widely\n              known in 1990. Dr. Auble had not yet attended any\n              seminars in forensic psychology at the time of petitioner’s\n              trial, and Dr. Martell had not yet published any of his articles\n              on the relationship between serotonin and violent behavior.\n              Dr. Nichols had suggested to the attorneys that a “Q Beam”\n              or an “MRI” be performed . . . . Both Drs. Auble and Martell\n              agree that those tests would have turned up nothing useful\n              in petitioner’s defense had the attorneys requested and\n              obtained funds for them. No one at any time ever suggested\n              to petitioner’s trial attorneys that they test the chemical\n              balance of his spinal fluid.\n\n               They could hardly have been expected to have been familiar\n               with 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid, or to have read any of those\n               three articles on their own.\n\nIn light of the fact that the “low serotonin” and “low blood sugar” research and theories\n\nwere not widely known and that Dr. Nichols’ suggested evaluation did not contemplate\n\n                                               32\n\ftesting for such imbalances, the petitioner has not demonstrated a reasonable\n\nprobability that but for his attorneys’ deficiency in failing to request expert services in a\n\ntimely fashion, the outcome of the sentencing phase would have been different.\n\n\n              In making this determination, we are also mindful of the principles set forth\n\nin Goad. The trial court made the following determinations with respect to these\n\nprinciples:\n\n                     The first question to be considered under Goad . . . is\n              the nature and extent of the mitigating evidence that was\n              available but not presented. Except for proof at the hearing on\n              this petition of petitioner’s low serotonin levels and low glucose\n              tolerance level, and their effect on petitioner when combined\n              with drug and alcohol use, all other proof of mitigation raised\n              by petitioner in the hearing on this petition had already been\n              presented at trial by his attorneys, in one form or another,\n              through jail records, lay witnesses, family members of\n              petitioner, and Dr. Nichols. . . .\n\n                      The second consideration under Goad is “whether\n              substantially similar mitigating evidence was presented to the\n              jury in either the guilt phase or penalty phase of the\n              proceedings.” The possibility that petitioner had these\n              problems due to a medical or psychological condition was\n              presented to the jury during mitigation proof by Dr. Nichols. He\n              testified that\n\n                     Mr. Cazes’s behavior as far as his history of\n                     chemical dependency which causes brain\n                     damage over an extended period of time like\n                     he’s abused chemicals, plus even before he\n                     started abusing chemicals he had a lot of\n                     difficulties with impulse control, rages, becoming\n                     angry for no apparent reason, and becoming –\n                     going into a rage and being destructive at times.\n                     And people who have these problems, a fairly\n                     high number of them have neurological\n                     problems.\n\n                              What I mean by neurological problems,\n                      some kind of organic impairment with their brain\n                      that interferes with their ability to control an urge,\n                      a momentary urge. Not necessarily that it would\n                      interfere with their ability to plan out something\n                      over a long term, but any time their affect or their\n                      feelings are elevated, be it anxiety, be it anger,\n                      be it excitement, they’re happy about something\n                      just like a little child at Christmas may get into a\n                      lot more trouble because they’re real excited\n                      about things, well, they’re having impulse control\n                      problems. Well, that’s what I’m talking about\n                      here, that when his affect is up, his feeling level\n                      is up, then he may have more difficulty or he\n                      does have more difficulty controlling himself.\n\n                            There’s a possibility that that is due to\n                      some brain impairment or organic impairment .\n                      ...\n\n\n                                               33\n\f              Even though we know now, after petitioner has been\n              thoroughly tested, that he had no significant brain damage due\n              to drug use or head trauma, still the jury was told that it was a\n              distinct possibility that many of his problems were caused by\n              a condition out of his control.\n              The third Goad consideration is “whether there was such\n              strong evidence of aggravating factors that the mitigating\n              evidence would not have affected the jury’s determination.”\n              Assuming therefore, that the attorneys had properly and timely\n              requested and received funds, and time, to further evaluate\n              petitioner, and that they had in fact found an expert who was\n              acquainted with the relationship between serotonin and\n              impulsive behavior, and petitioner decided to present that\n              mitigation evidence to the jury (that a combination of low\n              serotonin, low blood sugar, extensive substance abuse, tragic\n              childhood and hatred of women had all combined to make\n              petitioner not responsible for his actions), the state would have\n              been able to rebut that theory with petitioner’s history of\n              continued violence in a prison setting while awaiting trial,\n              during a time when he had a raised serotonin level, was not on\n              junk food, and was not using alcohol or illegal drugs. This\n              violent behavior would most likely have alienated the jury. An\n              important part of this theory of petitioner also concerns his\n              hatred of women and his continued violence toward them, a\n              rage which was “triggered” by an “emotional memory,”\n              compelling him to rape and murder Ms. Skinner in a “fugue\n              state.” This would have also tended to alienate the jury, and\n              in view of the aggravating circumstance offered in this trial that\n              petitioner had been convicted of the Aggravated Rape and\n              Attempted Murder of another woman which was committed\n              after the murder of Ms. Skinner, may have practically ensured\n              a sentence of death.\n\n              ....\n\n              Considering the nature of the omitted mitigation, necessarily\n              involving petitioner’s hatred of women and his lack of control\n              even when not on drugs, alcohol, junk food and low serotonin,\n              as compared to the strong aggravating factors [1) “heinous,\n              atrocious and cruel,” in that the crime involved a driving to the\n              scene, a systematic, premeditated breaking into the home of\n              a known elderly victim, an extremely bloody, brutal murder and\n              rape . . . ., plus 2) “prior convictions for crimes of violence” in\n              that petitioner, after raping and killing Ms. Skinner, committed\n              and was convicted of another Aggravated Rape and Assault\n              to Murder] petitioner has failed to show prejudice. . . . “Given\n              the overwhelming aggravating factors, there is no reasonable\n              probability that the omitted evidence would have changed the\n              conclusion of the jury that the aggravating circumstances\n              outweighed the mitigating circumstances and hence, the\n              sentence imposed.” Strickland, at 697.\n\nConsidering the petitioner’s inability to demonstrate even a possibility that serotonin\n\nand blood sugar testing would have been performed and considering the principles set\nforth in Goad and their application to this case, we conclude that the petitioner has not\n\ndemonstrated prejudice.\n\n\n\n                C. Petitioner’s Right to a Limited Cross-examination\n\n\n                                             34\n\f          The petitioner contends that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to protect\n\nhis right to a limited cross-examination during the sentencing phase of trial. He\n\ncontends that he wanted to testify at the sentencing phase about his background\nwithout being subject to cross-examination regarding details of the crime and that his\n\nattorneys filed a motion to prevent the state from asking questions about the crime,\n\nwhich the trial court denied. The petitioner argues that his attorneys offered no support\nfor their motion and inadvertently waived the issue for appeal by asking the petitioner\n\nwhat he remembered about the day of the murder.\n\n\n\n              On direct appeal, our supreme court acknowledged that “in the limited\n\nsphere of a death penalty sentencing hearing, a capital defendant’s testimony regarding\n\nmitigating factors that are wholly collateral to the merits of the charges against him does\nnot operate as a complete waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination.” Cazes,\n\n875 S.W.2d at 266. Nevertheless, the court determined that the petitioner was not\n\nprejudiced by the cross-examination because the petitioner could not recall anything\n\nabout the crime. Id. Similarly, in denying post-conviction relief, the trial court concluded\n\nthat the “state’s cross-examination was therefore effectively limited by petitioner’s\n\ntestimony that he lacked any knowledge of the circumstances of the offense.” The\n\npetitioner has not demonstrated that the record preponderates against this finding.\n\n\n\n                             D. Conceding Premeditation\n\n          The petitioner contends that counsel were ineffective during closing argument\n\nat sentencing because they mentioned that the jury had already found premeditation.\nThe petitioner contends that because he was convicted of felony murder, which does\n\nnot require premeditation, this erroneous reference by counsel resulted in prejudice.\n\nThe petitioner offers no support for this argument, and we hold that it is without merit. A\nreview of the closing argument shows that counsel focused not on the crime itself but\n\non mitigation. The petitioner has not demonstrated prejudice.\n\n\n\n                       E. Failure to Raise all Issues on Appeal\n              The petitioner contends that his attorneys were ineffective on appeal for\n\nfailing to raise all issues. Specifically, he contends that the attorneys should have\n\nargued that (1) the jury’s finding of the “prior violent felony” aggravating circumstance\n\n                                            35\n\fviolated the ex post facto and due process clauses of the Tennessee and United States\n\nConstitutions, (2) the reasonable doubt jury instruction violated the due process clause\n\nof the United States Constitution, and (3) the manner in which appellate courts conduct\nharmless error analysis in capital cases violates state guarantees of trial by jury and\n\nfederal guarantees of due process. Our supreme court has previously determined that\n\nthese issues are without merit. See King v.

IMPARTIAL JURY\n\n              The petitioner contends that he was denied the right to an impartial jury\nbecause the trial court refused to allow individual, sequestered voir dire concerning\n\npretrial publicity. In conjunction, he argues that his attorneys were ineffective for failing\n\nto include examples of pretrial publicity in the record for appeal.\n\n\n\n              With respect to the petitioner’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\nthe petitioner claims that his attorneys failed to include examples of the pretrial publicity\n\nin the record for appeal. The petitioner argues that this precluded the supreme court\n\nfrom adequately addressing the jury voir dire issues on appeal. However, this particular\nclaim was neither included in the post-conviction petition below nor addressed by the\n\ntrial court. Accordingly, this issue is not properly before this court and is waived. See\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-112 (1990); Butler v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1492822\"><a href=\"/opinion/1492822/butler-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 902 (Tenn.\n1990); Brown v.

Regardless, the\n\npetitioner has failed to establish prejudice.\n\n\n\n              “Individual voir dire is mandated only when there is a ‘significant\n\npossibility’ that a juror has been exposed to potentially prejudicial material.” State v.\n\nHarris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2411822\"><a href=\"/opinion/2411822/state-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (Tenn. 1992) (citing State v.

The decision of the trial court to deny individual voir dire of the\nvenire remains within the sound discretion of the court and will not be reversed on\n\nappeal absent a finding of manifest error. Howell, 868 S.W.2d at 247-48. The\n\npetitioner must demonstrate that the jurors were biased or prejudiced against him\n\n                                                36\n\fbecause of the pretrial publicity. State v.

Claybrook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1621242\"><a href=\"/opinion/1621242/state-v-claybrook/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1987) and State v.

Crim. App.\n\n1992). In both of these cases, the court determined that the trial court’s refusal to allow\n\nindividual, sequestered voir dire was prejudicial error because the prospective jurors\nadmitted that they knew the defendants had been charged with or convicted of other\n\ncrimes. In Claybrook, the court determined that the need to conduct individual,\n\nsequestered voir dire became apparent “when it was made known to the trial court that\n\n80% of the first group of prospective jurors had heard information regarding the\n\ndefendant’s case, two members of that initial panel mentioned in the presence of other\n\nprospective jurors that they had heard that the defendant had been in prison before.”\n\n736 S.W.2d at 100.\n\n\n\n              In the present case, however, the jurors were not questioned about their\n\nknowledge of the petitioner’s previous record. Additionally, as the trial court noted in\n\ndenying post-conviction relief, “[o]f the prospective jurors examined, approximately\ntwenty-five percent had been exposed to some pretrial publicity about this case . . . .”\n\nThe record establishes that only two of the jurors who heard the petitioner’s case had\n\nbeen exposed to pretrial publicity, and unlike Claybrook, no evidence exists that the\n\njurors heard information that the petitioner had previously been in jail. The empaneled\n\njurors stated that they could render an impartial verdict based solely upon the evidence\n\npresented at trial. Thus, the petitioner has not demonstrated, as is required, that the\n\njurors who actually heard his case were biased or prejudiced because of pretrial\npublicity.\n\n\n\n\n                                            37\n\f                 Finally, we note that in his reply brief, the petitioner asserts in a footnote\n\nthat Rule 606(b), Tenn. R. Evid., effectively precluded him from demonstrating prejudice\n\nby disallowing the testimony of jurors at the evidentiary hearing. He relies upon Henley\n\nv. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060938\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060938/henley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1997). In Henley, the petitioner presented affidavits\n\nfrom jurors at the evidentiary hearing stating that they were swayed against the\n\npetitioner because his mother did not testify during the sentencing phase of a capital\ntrial. The court concluded that the affidavits were not admissible because they “related\n\nto the precise subject matter about which a juror is strictly forbidden from testifying by\n\nRule 606(b)- the effect of the mother’s failure to testify on the jury verdict.” 960 S.W.2d\nat 581. However, we do not believe that the holding in Henley precludes the use of\n\njuror affidavits to prove prejudicial exposure to pretrial publicity. See, e.g., Claybrook,\n\n736 S.W.2d at 100-01 (holding that jurors’ testimony regarding exposure to pretrial\npublicity allowed at motion for new trial); State v. Robert Emmet Dunlap, Jr., No.\n\n02C01-9801-CC-00009, Henry County (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 21, 1998) (holding that\n\nthe “extraneous prejudicial information” exception to the admissibility of juror testimony\n\nincludes a juror’s personal knowledge of an accused’s prior criminal record).\n\n\n\n                       IV. USE OF AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE\n\n          The petitioner contends that the use of his previous convictions for\n\naggravated rape and assault with intent to murder, based on conduct that occurred\nafter the present offenses but for which the petitioner was convicted before the present\n\noffenses, violates the due process and ex post facto clauses of the state and federal\n\nconstitutions.\n\n\n          The petitioner committed the crimes against Ms. Skinner at issue in this case\n\nin April 1988. In June 1989, the petitioner committed separate offenses of attempted\nmurder and aggravated rape, and he was convicted of these crimes before the trial in\n\n\n\nthe present case. The state relied upon these previous convictions as an aggravating\n\ncircumstance. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-2-302(I)(2).\n\n\n\n          The petitioner contends that using convictions for crimes committed after the\n\noffense in the present case to enhance his punishment in the present case violates due\n\n                                                38\n\fprocess and ex post facto. Our supreme court rejected the same argument in State v.\n\nCaldwell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2367119\"><a href=\"/opinion/2367119/state-v-caldwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 465 (Tenn. 1984). In Caldwell, the court stated:\n\n              The Defendant avers that it was error for the Trial Court to\n              allow the introduction of his conviction for first degree murder\n              in the Lipford case as an aggravating circumstance in this\n              case, since the Lipford murder occurred after the [murder in\n              this case].\n              ....\n\n              Caldwell claims that using the subsequent murder as an\n              aggravating circumstance permits an ex post facto law. The\n              language in the statute, “previously convicted” clearly indicates\n              that the date of the conviction, not of the commission of the\n              crime, is the important factor. The order in which the crimes\n              were actually committed is irrelevant, as long as the\n              convictions have been entered before the sentencing hearing\n              at which they are introduced into evidence.\nId. at 464-65; see also State v. Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1061002\"><a href=\"/opinion/1061002/state-v-hodges/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357 (Tenn. 1997) ( “We have\n\npreviously held on numerous occasions that so long as a defendant is convicted of a\n\nviolent felony prior to the sentencing hearing at which the previous conviction is\nintroduced, this aggravating circumstance is applicable.”). In the present case, the\n\naggravating circumstance was in effect at the time the petitioner committed the crimes\n\nagainst Ms. Skinner. In addition, Caldwell provided further notice to the petitioner that\n\nfuture convictions could be used to enhance punishment, regardless of when the\n\ncriminal acts underlying the convictions were committed. This issue is without merit.\n\n\n                             V.

He argues that the information in the police reports was exculpatory, claiming\n\nthat it provided substantial clues that should have led the trial attorneys to investigate\npetitioner’s mental condition. The state contends that the prosecutor was not required\n\nto disclose the complete police investigation and that, in any event, the information\n\ncontained in the reports was not exculpatory.\n\n\n\n          The state has a duty to furnish exculpatory evidence to the accused, and any\n\n“suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request\n\nviolates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment,\nirrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” Brady, 373 U.S. at 87, 83\n\n\n                                             39\n\fS.

Edgin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2371758\"><a href=\"/opinion/2371758/state-v-edgin/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (Tenn. 1995). In Edgin, our supreme court\n\nadopted the following standard for materiality:\n              [T]here is constitutional error “if there is a reasonable\n              probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the\n              defense, the result of the proceeding would have been\n              different.”\n              ....\n\n                “[The] touchstone of materiality is a ‘reasonable probability’ of\n                a different result, and the adjective is important. The question\n                is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have\n                received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its\n                absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting\n                in a verdict worthy of confidence. A ‘reasonable probability’ of\n                a different result is accordingly shown when the Government’s\n\n                                               40\n\f              evidentiary suppression ‘undermines confidence in the\n              outcome of the trial.’”\n902 S.W.2d at 390 (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 434, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1556\n\n(1995)).\n\n\n\n              The petitioner’s attorney testified at the evidentiary hearing that he never\n\nreceived copies of the police reports. Gloria Shettles testified that she interviewed the\n\npersons named in the report and that they stated that the petitioner was an excellent\nworker; did not take criticism well; was impatient, emotional and impulsive; and would\n\nbecome angry and out of control when he was drinking. The trial court dismissed the\n\nclaim, finding that the petitioner did not specifically define his issue and offered\ninsufficient proof to support his allegations.\n\n\n\n              We believe that the petitioner’s claim fails because he has not established\nthat he was unable to obtain the information himself, that the evidence was favorable,\n\nor that the information was material. The information contained in the police reports is\n\ngeneral background information of the petitioner’s demeanor, provided by the\n\npetitioner’s friends, acquaintances and former employers. Because the information\n\ncame from people the petitioner knew, there is no reason why he could not have\nobtained the information himself. Additionally, the information does not contain direct\n\nexculpatory information. Despite the petitioner’s argument that the information could\n\nhave led his attorneys to investigate the petitioner’s mental status further, the police\nreports do not provide any additional information of which the attorneys were not\n\nalready aware at trial. Furthermore, we believe that the petitioner has not\n\ndemonstrated a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different had his attorneys been aware of the reports. We have previously\n\ndetermined that the trial court properly found against the petitioner regarding his claim\n\nof ineffective investigation into a possible insanity defense. Thus, the petitioner has\n\nfailed to show that the information is material.\n\n\n                   VI. REASONABLE DOUBT JURY INSTRUCTION\n\n              The petitioner contends that the reasonable doubt jury instructions at both\nphases of his trial were unconstitutional because the trial court used the term “moral\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fcertainty” and excluded from the definition a “doubt that may arise from possibility.” The\n\nreasonable doubt jury instructions contested by the petitioner were upheld as\n\nconstitutional. See Carter v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060963/carter-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625 (Tenn. 1997); Nichols, 877\nS.W.2d at 734. This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n                     VII. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ERROR\n              The petitioner contends that the cumulative effect of all the alleged\n\nconstitutional errors resulted in the petitioner being deprived of a fair trial. See State v.\n\nCadle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1622575\"><a href=\"/opinion/1622575/state-v-cadle/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1982). Considering our rulings in this\n\n\ncase, we conclude that no errors exist that cumulatively would deprive the petitioner of\n\na fair trial. See Rosenthal v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1734147\"><a href=\"/opinion/1734147/rosenthal-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4-5 (Tenn. 1956).\n\n\n\n                             VIII. HARMLESS ERROR ANALYSIS\n\n              The petitioner contends that the Tennessee Supreme Court’s harmless\n\nerror analysis on direct appeal with respect to the jury’s erroneous application of the\n\nfelony murder aggravating circumstance violated his right to a jury determination of\n\nsentencing and to due process of law. He argues that Tennessee law creates a due\n\nprocess liberty interest in jury resentencing that precludes the court’s application of a\n\nharmless error analysis when the sentencing jury has considered an invalid aggravating\ncircumstance. This argument has been rejected by our supreme court. See Boyd v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060917\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060917/state-v-boyd/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560 (Tenn. 1998) (holding that a jury’s reliance on an invalid\n\nfelony murder aggravating factor does not require a resentencing hearing if the\nreviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the sentence would have\n\nbeen the same had the jury given no weight to the invalid aggravating factor). This\n\nissue is without merit.\n\n\n              IX. IN CAMERA REVIEW OF PROSECUTOR’S FILES\n\n              The petitioner contends that the trial court erred by failing to conduct an in\n\ncamera review of the prosecutor’s files regarding other crimes with which the petitioner\nhad been charged. The petitioner sought to review the files to find information\n\npertaining to his post-conviction issues, particularly the issue of his mental state, but the\n\ntrial court denied the motion. The files pertain to alleged acts of child sexual abuse,\n\n                                             42\n\fand the trial court denied the request pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-1-612, which\n\nprohibits the disclosure of all records concerning reports of child sexual abuse. The\n\nstatute provides limited circumstances under which disclosure may be allowed, but the\ntrial court determined that those circumstances did not apply in this case.\n\n\n\n               The petitioner cites Munke v. Munke, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 804 (Tenn. Ct.\n\nApp. 1994), to support his contention that the trial court was required to conduct an in\n\ncamera inspection. However, in that case, the court held that an inspection was\n\nrequired under the statutory exception to disclosure “for the purpose of protecting a\nchild or children from child abuse or child sexual abuse . . . .” Tenn. Code Ann. § 37-1-\n\n612(h). This exception does not apply to the petitioner’s case. This issue is without\n\nmerit. See, e.g., State v. Caughron, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1668932\"><a href=\"/opinion/1668932/state-v-caughron/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541 (Tenn. 1993) (holding that a\n\ntrial court is not required to review the entire prosecutor’s file absent a specific showing\n\nfrom the petitioner).\n\n\n\n               In consideration of the foregoing and the record as a whole, the judgment\n\nof the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                          ______________________________\n                                          Joseph M.
