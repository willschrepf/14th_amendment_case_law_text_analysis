Ct. No. M105497)\n        Respondent,\n\n                 v.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT and\nREMEDIATION MANAGEMENT, INC.,\n\n       Defendant, Cross-Complainant and\n       Appellant,\n\nSURETEC INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n      Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n        This dispute arose from a public works project involving the construction of a\ndental clinic at the Presidio of Monterey (the Project). The owner, the United States\nArmy Corps of Engineers (the Corps), retained JMR Construction Corp. (JMR) as\ngeneral contractor for the Project. JMR, in turn, entered into various subcontracts,\nincluding separate electrical and plumbing subcontracts, with Environmental Assessment\nand Remediation Management, Inc. (EAR). SureTec Insurance Company (SureTec)\nissued separate bonds guaranteeing EAR’s performance under the two subcontracts.\n        While the Project was ongoing, JMR (1) communicated with EAR about alleged\ndelays, deficient and late submittals, and improper plumbing work, and (2) retained\n\n        *\n         Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 8.1105(b) and 8.1110, this opinion is\ncertified for publication with the exception of parts I.A., I.C., III, IV, V, and VI of the\nDiscussion.\n\fcertain funds otherwise due to EAR under the subcontracts. After the Project was\ncompleted, JMR filed suit against EAR and SureTec (collectively, defendants) for breach\nof contract and for foreclosure of the performance bonds. JMR alleged it was damaged\nas a result of EAR’s failure to perform under the two subcontracts. EAR filed a cross-\ncomplaint for recovery of retention funds withheld under the subcontracts.\n       After a court trial, JMR was awarded the net amount of $315,631, which included\nan offset for the retention funds JMR withheld under the subcontracts. In posttrial\nproceedings, the court issued an order determining JMR was entitled to recover attorney\nfees in an amount to be determined for its successful defense of the cross-complaint. The\ncourt also awarded JMR $90,644.07 in expert witness fees pursuant to Code of Civil\nProcedure section 9981 by concluding that JMR’s total monetary recovery ($315,631 plus\nan undetermined amount of attorney fees) had exceeded the $375,000 amount of its\npretrial settlement offers. SureTec and EAR filed separate appeals.\n       EAR makes seven arguments on appeal. First, it asserts there was no substantial\nevidence to support the trial court’s finding it was liable to JMR for delays on the Project.\nSecond, it argues the court erred by using the Eichleay method of calculating extended\nhome office overhead damages. Third, it asserts the court erred by utilizing the modified\ntotal cost method of calculating disruption and delay damages. Fourth, it argues the\ncourt, in its statement of decision, failed to address essential matters of fact and law.\nFifth, it contends the court erred in determining JMR was entitled to attorney fees in\ndefending the cross-complaint. Sixth, it asserts JMR was not entitled to recover its expert\nwitness fees pursuant to section 998. And seventh, it contends the court erred by denying\nits motion for new trial.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise\nspecified.\n                                              2\n\f       SureTec contends JMR cannot prevail against SureTec because JMR failed to\ndeclare EAR in default under the subcontracts, and JMR failed to notify SureTec of any\nsuch default. It also contends the order finding JMR entitled to attorney fees on EAR’s\ncross-complaint was improper as to SureTec. Further, it contests the award to JMR of\nexpert witness fees under section 998. And it argues that SureTec’s liability must be\nlimited to a maximum of $471,881, the ceiling of its liability under the performance bond\non the plumbing subcontract.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude the court did not err in its\nutilization of the Eichleay method to calculate extended home office overhead damages\nand in its use of the modified total cost method of calculating JMR’s disruption and delay\ndamages. We also hold the court did not err in finding SureTec liable under the\nperformance bonds, concluding that formal notice of EAR’s default was not a condition\nprecedent to JMR’s recovery under the bonds. In the unpublished portion of this opinion,\nwe conclude (1) there was substantial evidence supporting the court’s finding that EAR\nwas liable to JMR for Project delays; (2) the court’s statement of decision was not\ndefective; (3) defendants’ challenges to the interim, nonfinal, postjudgment order\ndetermining that JMR was entitled to recover attorney fees in defending the cross-\ncomplaint are not cognizable at this time; (4) defendants’ challenges to the award of\nJMR’s expert witness fees under section 998 are meritorious; (5) EAR’s claim that the\ncourt abused its discretion in denying EAR’s motion for new trial has no merit; and\n(6) SureTec’s request for an order that its maximum liability is $471,881 is not\ncognizable because it is a request for an advisory opinion. Accordingly we will affirm\nthe judgment, reverse the order awarding expert witness fees, and remand the case for\nfurther postjudgment proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                            PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       On April 29, 2010, JMR filed its complaint against EAR and SureTec. JMR\nalleged four causes of action: (1) breach of the plumbing subcontract; (2) enforcement\n                                             3\n\fand foreclosure on the performance bond for the plumbing subcontract; (3) breach of the\nelectrical subcontract; and (4) enforcement and foreclosure on the performance bond for\nthe electrical subcontract. The first and third causes of action were alleged against EAR,\nwhile the second and fourth causes of action were alleged against SureTec.2 JMR alleged\nthat EAR’s failure or refusal to perform its work under the two subcontracts in\naccordance with the Project’s schedule “caused project delay, acceleration, and related\ndamages to JMR.” The alleged damages included “offset of JMR claims against the\nOwner, increased cost of JMR on-site performance costs and other loss of cost recovery\nand overhead on the Project.” In each of the four causes of action, JMR claimed its\ndamages were in an amount “not less than $200,000.00.”\n       EAR filed a cross-complaint against JMR alleging breach of contract and common\ncounts. It alleged in separate causes of action that JMR had breached the electrical\nsubcontract and plumbing subcontract, and that as a result of these breaches, EAR had\nbeen damaged in an amount in excess of $108,913.31.\n       A five-day court trial took place in January 2012. After the parties submitted\nposttrial briefs in lieu of final argument, the court issued a ruling on April 30, 2012,\nfinding in favor of JMR in the total amount of $379,318, which amount included a\ndeduction of $121,893 that had been previously withheld from EAR under the\nsubcontracts. The court further ordered that EAR take nothing on its cross-complaint.\n       Pursuant to the court’s request, JMR submitted a proposed statement of decision in\nwhich it withdrew one of its claims and adjusted the amount of another claim, resulting in\nrevised damages award of $315,631. The damages were derived by (1) adding five\ndamage figures in amounts of $29,249 (air compressor), $132,168 (field overhead for\ndelay), $15,440 (field overhead for Project closeout), $14,244 (markup for field\n\n       2\n         JMR also sought in the second and fourth causes of action to foreclose on the\npayment bonds issued by SureTec under the two subcontracts. The payment bonds are\nnot at issue in this appeal.\n                                              4\n\foverhead), $60,693 (Eichleay home office overhead), and $185,730 (damages during\nframing and drywall phase); and (2) subtracting from this amount $121,893 previously\nwithheld under the subcontracts. On July 19, 2012, the court signed the statement of\ndecision. On August 14, 2012, the court entered judgment in favor of JMR and against\ndefendants in the amount of $315,631. The court also ordered that EAR and SureTec\ntake nothing on the cross-complaint3 and that defendants were liable for JMR’s costs,\nincluding attorney fees in defending the cross-complaint, in an amount to be determined\nafter appropriate filings by JMR.\n       In postjudgment proceedings (discussed in greater detail, post), the court issued an\norder on November 13, 2012, granting JMR’s request for recovery of expert fees of\n$90,644.07. In the same order, the court reaffirmed a prior tentative ruling that it would\naward attorney fees to JMR for its successful defense of EAR’s cross-complaint in an\namount to be determined at a later time.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       I.     EAR’s Appeal of the Judgment\n       EAR asserts four challenges to the court’s judgment. First, it contends there is no\nsubstantial evidence to support the court’s finding that EAR breached its subcontracts\nwith JMR. Second, it argues the court erred in using the Eichleay formula of calculating\nhome office overhead damages. Third, it claims the court erred in applying the modified\ntotal cost method of damages in connection with alleged delay damages associated with\nthe interior installation of metal studs and drywall (hereafter, the framing and drywall\nphase). And fourth, it argues the court’s statement of decision was defective in that it\nfailed to take into consideration essential matters of fact and law. We address each of\nthese contentions below.\n\n\n       3\n         The finding that SureTec take nothing on the cross-complaint appears to be in\nerror, since EAR was the sole cross-complainant.\n                                             5\n\f              A.     Sufficiency-of-Evidence Challenge\n                     1.     JMR Evidence\n                            a.     Testimony\n       On July 25, 2006, the Corps notified JMR that it had been awarded the contract to\ncomplete the Project at a total contract price of $6,691,000 (the prime contract).\nThereafter, on September 19, 2006, JMR and EAR executed the subcontract for electrical\nwork for a total contract price of $732,500. On November 14, 2006, JMR and EAR\nexecuted the subcontract for plumbing work for a total contract price of $471,881. Both\nsubcontracts recited that the schedule for performance of the prime contract was 450 days\nfrom the “Owner’s Notice to Proceed Date [of] 8/30/06,” thereby making the completion\ndate November 23, 2007. EAR acknowledged these “contract durations and time\nconstraints and [agreed it would] comply with [JMR’s] construction schedule.”\n       Work on the Project continued nearly six months passed the scheduled completion\ndate of November 23, 2007. The beneficial occupancy date—i.e., completion of the\nProject—was May 14, 2008.\n       Several representatives of JMR and one JMR-retained expert testified that EAR\nwas responsible for concurrent delays on the Project. Ron Rivard, JMR’s Vice President,\ntestified that the Project was delayed and the Corps, through change orders, granted a\n180-day extension of the Project completion date. The Corps was responsible in part for\nthe extension due to delays in approval of the landscaping plans. Rivard also testified\nthat three subcontractors—EAR, Countywide Mechanical (Countywide), and Del Monte\nGlass (Glass)—contributed to delays, but he did not know the number of delay days\ncaused by each of the three subcontractors, saying “[t]hat’s up [to] the experts.”\n       Rivard testified that one aspect of EAR-caused delay involved the furnishing of an\nair compressor. EAR initially disputed that an air compressor was included in its scope\nof work under the plumbing subcontract, but it eventually supplied an air compressor\nwithout producing a submittal beforehand. Submittals were required on the Project so the\n                                             6\n\fCorps could give advance approval of the equipment. The air compressor was not\napproved by the Corps, and EAR refused to provide a Corps-approved replacement\ncompressor. JMR thereafter procured and installed a Corps-approved compressor.\nRivard testified that EAR’s failure to supply an approved air compressor caused delay in\nJMR’s performance under the prime contract. He testified the schedule called for the air\ncompressor to be supplied in October 2007. Instead, it was supplied in February or\nMarch 2008.\n       Steven Hupaylo, JMR’s job superintendent for the Project from its inception to\nAugust 2007, was responsible for managing and coordinating the subcontractors in the\nfield. Hupaylo testified the drywall work for the interior of the clinic did not go well.\nJMR’s plan was to install metal framing, have EAR do its plumbing and electrical work\nin the uncovered metal frame, and then cover the metal frame along with the plumbing\nand electrical work with drywall. JMR had separated the building into three areas, with\nthe intention of going room-by-room to have this work done efficiently. According to\nHupaylo: “We had a good shot at doing the thing. And the biggest problem we had was .\n. . the plumbing and electrical that held us up in the [P]roject [by] not having materials,\nnot having skilled people, [and] not having any people sometimes. That was the single\nbiggest issue.” Hupaylo also testified that EAR’s plumbing crew “left the site a lot” and\nwere often working at other locations on the base. EAR’s foreman would sometimes\nshow up on the site without materials; he would promise to return to the site the next day,\nbut would not. As a result of ongoing problems with EAR’s performance under both\nsubcontracts, JMR had to install the drywall in a piecemeal fashion.\n       Daniel Spade worked as JMR’s project manager from January 2007 until the\nProject’s completion. Spade testified there were significant punch list items at the end of\nthe Project resulting from EAR’s deficient performance under the subcontracts. In\naddition, aside from the air compressor issue, there were problems with (1) an undersized\n\n\n                                              7\n\fwater heater, (2) the mixing valves controlling hot and cold water, and (3) the improper\noperation of the fire alarm and life safety system.\n       JMR also presented testimony from John Elmer, a construction management\nexpert with expertise in scheduling. JMR retained Elmer to review the schedule for the\nProject, to identify whether there were any delays in the Project’s completion, and to\ndetermine the causes of any delays. Elmer testified regarding concurrent delays on the\nProject. Defendants did not challenge Elmer’s qualifications as an expert.\n       Elmer testified that for any construction project, the owner and the general\ncontractor agree to an initial construction schedule—a baseline schedule. The general\ncontractor prepares a baseline schedule after receiving input from the subcontractors.\nThe general contractor then submits the baseline schedule to the owner for approval. The\nbaseline schedule is regularly tracked as work proceeds, typically through a computerized\nprogram. If there is a delay in the delivered date of any work, and the delay is on the\ncritical path—i.e., the longest path of activities required to complete the project—that\ndelay will extend the completion date of the Project.\n       In arriving at his opinions as to any delays to the baseline schedule, Elmer\nreviewed a number of construction documents, including monthly schedule updates, daily\nquality control reports, daily subcontractor reports, submittal logs, punch lists, and\ncorrespondence. In his analysis of the critical path of the Project, Elmer also created an\nas-built schedule from December 2007 to May 2008 to attempt to identify accurately the\nprogress of the work on the Project as compared with the baseline schedule. He created\nthis as-built schedule because the monthly schedule updates in the latter months of the\nProject did not accurately reflect the status of work being performed.\n       Elmer opined there was a critical path delay that extended the Project’s completion\nby 180 days. That delay was reflected in change orders from the Corps extending the\ncompletion date of the Project. Elmer testified that the parties responsible for the delays\nwere the Corps and three subcontractors: EAR, Countywide, and Glass. He opined that\n                                              8\n\fEAR and Countywide were concurrently responsible for 142 of the 180 days of delay,\nand that of those 142 days, Glass was concurrently responsible for 28 days of delay.\n       Elmer also testified that from December 19, 2007, to May 14, 2008 (the beneficial\noccupancy date), the commissioning of the life safety systems (operable heating\nventilating and air conditioning, smoke detector, and fire alarm systems) drove the\ncritical path. “Commissioning” involved these systems being “signed off as being\ncomplete and operable” and was a precondition for the owner accepting beneficial\noccupancy. Elmer testified that EAR, Countywide and, to a much lesser extent, Glass\nwere the subcontractors performing work relevant to the completion of these systems. He\nalso said the concurrent delays by Countywide did not delay EAR’s work on the life\nsafety systems, and he opined that JMR did not contribute to any delay in the completion\nof the Project between December 2007 and May 14, 2008.\n                             b.     Documentary Evidence\n       JMR introduced documentary evidence showing EAR was responsible for Project\ndelays. Most of the written communications were from Daniel Spade, JMR’s project\nmanager. Spade addressed some of the communications directly to John Fieri, EAR’s\nplumbing project manager. Most of the written communications not addressed to Fieri\nlisted Fieri as a “cc” recipient. As noted twice by the trial court in its statement of\ndecision, Fieri was not called by EAR as a witness at trial.\n       On July 11, 2007, Spade advised EAR in an email to Ravindra Pendurthi, EAR’s\nowner, that EAR had, in contravention of the specifications, used laborers instead of\nplumbers to install pipe. Spade also noted that “an entire wage review of [EAR] on the\n[P]roject [was] likely,” and he directed that Pendurthi “get [his] company in compliance.”\n       On August 10, 2007, Spade wrote a letter to Pendurthi indicating that (1) EAR was\n“well behind schedule on the interior walls in the building”; (2) pipe insulation had “not\nbeen completed[,] preventing completion of the drywall in many areas”; (3) “[t]he gas\nlines ha[d] not been run and therefore drywall in some areas will have to be removed and\n                                              9\n\freplaced at EAR’s expense”; (4) EAR had not delivered soffit light fixtures on-site,\n“preventing covering these areas”; (5) “lobby wall sconces [we]re not on site[,]\npreventing completion of rough-in”; and (6) EAR was responsible for deficient\nsubmittals (about which JMR had previously notified EAR), and EAR’s failure to correct\nthe deficient submittals had resulted in the Corps withholding funds due to JMR. Spade\nalso summarized that “EAR[’s] plumbing performance [was] substantially behind and\n[was] severely impacting the schedule and the timely completion of the [P]roject.” Spade\nadvised EAR that it had “48 hours to properly man the [P]roject with qualified\nplumbers.”\n       Spade sent EAR two follow-up emails in September 2007. In those emails, he\nstated the Corps was “not approving anymore [sic] money for plumbing and electrical\nwork done last month because submittal items ha[d] not been completed.” Spade also\nreiterated that the Corps was “holding money from last month[’]s billing.”\n       On October 28, 2007, Spade sent an email to EAR that listed incomplete plumbing\nand electrical items, stating “[s]ome of these items are having impacts and almost all are\noverdue.” On November 21, 2007, Spade sent another email to Pendurthi, indicating\nthere were “[m]ajor issues still outstanding,” and stating: “We have run out of time\nwaiting for your electrical submittals to be turned in . . . . This is a serious problem in that\nit could impact closeout of the [P]roject. If this occurs[,] EAR will be held responsible for\nJMR’s overhead costs and any associated damages.”\n       On December 7, 2007, Spade sent another email to Pendurthi about EAR’s delays\nand problems with Project submittals. Earlier that day, the Corps had advised JMR that\nthe Corps had in the past retained a portion of contract payments based upon “excessive\noutstanding submittals; progression of work without proper quality controls; and slippage\nof the approved [P]roject schedule.” The Corps also noted that “many of these\ndeficiencies ha[d] not yet been resolved.” Spade advised Pendurthi that “EAR ha[d] been\nresponsible for a significant amount of the production delay and 5 pages out of the 11\n                                              10\n\fpages of outstanding submittals.” He also noted that “almost all” of the electrical\nsubmittals and some of the plumbing submittals were still outstanding.\n          On January 14, 2008, Spade advised EAR by email that the Corps had not granted\nbeneficial occupancy of the building because there were outstanding issues concerning\nthe mechanical system. Spade said “[t]he majority of the [outstanding] items are EAR’s\nresponsibility.” He indicated the items needed to “be resolved this week.” And he said:\n“You have already been informed of the financial impact involved. The fact that these\nitems are weeks old and still not resolved are major issues to the [C]orps[’] home office.”\n          On January 21, 2008, Spade sent a letter to Fieri stating “[t]here [were] a number\nof major items that ha[d] been on the Quality Control punchlist for over a month,” and\nthe Corps was citing to the major items as a reason for denying beneficial occupancy.\nSpade sent another email to Fieri on February 29, 2008, advising there were “still a\nnumber of [punch list] items to resolve. Some on the plumbing side[,] others on the\nelectrical . . . . There are still a large number of electrical submittals[,] which is a huge\nissue.”\n          On March 19, 2008, Spade sent another email to Fieri noting there were still a\nnumber of punch list items to be addressed. Spade indicated: “The simple fact is EAR is\nworking on other projects and is not completing this work. [¶] No one is on[-]site\naddressing these items. Every time Bob [Clark of the Corps] visits[,] he finds something\nnew.” Spade also wrote: “We have been struggling with EAR’s installation of the\nplumbing system; clean outs have not been installed, goose neck vents not installed,\nplumbing venting not installed per plan and requiring shop drawings prior to installation,\nmedical gas pipe not brazed per specification (still a sore point with the Corps), DDC\nvalve not installed per civil plan . . ., and payroll issues. [¶] The biggest issue on the\nelectrical side has been the submittals, which are still not complete and over 1 year late.”\n\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f                     2.     EAR’s Evidence\n       Ravindra Pendurthi, EAR’s owner, testified that EAR started plumbing work on\nthe Project in late September or early October 2006, even though the subcontract was not\nformally executed until December 2006. He said EAR commenced electrical work on the\nProject in or about September 2006, before that subcontract was executed. He testified\nthat EAR started work early at JMR’s urging, because JMR was “behind schedule” on the\nProject.\n       According to Pendurthi, JMR was slow in providing EAR with a baseline schedule\nfor the Project. He said JMR did not provide it until March 2007. He acknowledged that\nat the time, EAR responded in writing that the schedule was fine, but that its compliance\nwith it was dependent on timely work by other tradesmen whose work needed to be\ncompleted before EAR’s.\n       Pendurthi described several tasks that were added to its scope of work under both\nsubcontracts which extended EAR’s time to complete its performance. He also testified\nthat JMR approved change orders for this additional work, but JMR did not formally\ngrant EAR extensions of time. Instead, in each instance, the JMR representative (either\nSpade or Hupaylo) advised EAR that JMR was behind schedule but would “take care of\n[EAR’s extension request] at the end of the [P]roject.”\n       Pendurthi testified there was a period of time in which EAR inquired of JMR\nabout the equipment JMR was going to provide that impacted EAR’s rough-in plumbing\nwork. He said JMR’s delay in providing this information interfered with EAR’s ability to\ncomplete its work.\n       Pendurthi denied that EAR lacked sufficient materials or failed to supply sufficient\npersonnel to work on the Project. He also denied that EAR’s work crews on the Project\nwere pulled off the job to do other work. He claimed EAR had dedicated crews for the\nProject. He acknowledged that EAR’s foreman sometimes did not show up to work\n\n\n                                            12\n\fbecause he had a persistent gout problem. But, he said, EAR eventually addressed the\nissue by replacing the foreman.\n       Pendurthi testified that much of the drywall work—particularly the work in the x-\nray room and dentures room—was done out of sequence and was hampered because JMR\ndid not have proper submittals. He said this caused delays in EAR’s performance.\nPendurthi also testified that the drywall cost was elevated and its time of completion was\nlengthened because the Corps required a “level five finish,” which was a quality much\nmore difficult to achieve than a normal sheetrock job. In addition, JMR used an out-of-\ntown workforce that resulted in cost overruns. Pendurthi admitted on cross-examination\nthat EAR did not advise JMR in writing that JMR was causing delays in EAR’s\nperformance.\n       Pendurthi also testified there was a period of time in or about November 2006\nwhen JMR did not have on-site quality control personnel as required by the Corps. JMR\nasked for help from EAR, and EAR supplied quality control personnel to work on-site for\napproximately one month. Pendurthi testified that JMR’s failure to have on-site quality\ncontrol personnel for a period of time delayed EAR’s performance.\n       According to Pendurthi, all of EAR’s work under both subcontracts was accepted.\nPendurthi testified that by November 30, 2007—according to applications for payment\nEAR had submitted—EAR’s plumbing and electrical work were 98.66 percent and 96.36\npercent completed, respectively. Pendurthi testified that after December 1, 2007, EAR’s\nremaining work was “[m]ostly finish work” during which time EAR was waiting for\nother trades to complete their work.\n                     3.     Substantial Evidence Standard of Review\n       As a fundamental proposition, a judgment or order is presumed correct on appeal.\n(In re Marriage of Arceneaux (1990) 51 Cal.3d 1130, 1133.) “ ‘All intendments and\npresumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and\nerror must be affirmatively shown.’ ” (Denham v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County\n                                            13\n\f(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564.) It is appellant’s burden to overcome this presumption of\ncorrectness, which burden includes providing an adequate record demonstrating error.\n(Ibid.; see also Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter\nGroup 2013) ¶ 8:17, pp. 8-5 to 8-6, rev. #1, 2013.) The doctrine of implied findings is “a\nnatural and logical corollary” to (1) the presumption of the correctness of the judgment,\n(2) the fact that all intendments and presumptions are made in favor of that correctness,\nand (3) the appellant’s burden of demonstrating error with an adequate record. (Fladeboe\nv. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 42, 58 (Fladeboe).) This\n“doctrine . . . requires the appellate court to infer the trial court made all factual findings\nnecessary to support the judgment. [Citation.]” (Ibid.; see Michael U. v. Jamie B. (1985)\n39 Cal.3d 787, 792-793, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in In re\nZacharia D. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 435, 448-449.)\n       A disputed factual issue that has been resolved by the trial court is reviewed under\nthe substantial evidence standard. (Winograd v. American Broadcasting Co. (1998)\n68 Cal.App.4th 624, 632.) As the California Supreme Court has explained: “In\nreviewing the evidence on such an appeal all conflicts must be resolved in favor of the\nrespondent, and all legitimate and reasonable inferences indulged in to uphold the verdict\nif possible. It is an elementary, but often overlooked principle of law, that when a verdict\nis attacked as being unsupported, the power of the appellate court begins and ends with a\ndetermination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or\nuncontradicted, which will support the conclusion reached by the jury. When two or\nmore inferences can be reasonably deduced from the facts, the reviewing court is without\npower to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court. [Citations.]” (Crawford v.\nSouthern Pacific Co. (1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429 (Crawford); see also Roddenberry v.\nRoddenberry (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 651-652.)\n       Upon review of the record in its entirety, “all of the evidence must be examined,\nbut it is not weighed. All of the evidence most favorable to the respondent must be\n                                               14\n\faccepted as true, and that unfavorable discarded as not having sufficient verity, to be\naccepted by the trier of fact. If the evidence so viewed is sufficient as a matter of law, the\njudgment must be affirmed.” (Estate of Teel (1944) 25 Cal.2d 520, 527.)\n       The benchmark “substantial evidence” is not “synonymous with ‘any’ evidence.”\n(People v. Bassett (1968) 69 Cal.2d 122, 139.) As one court has explained: “While it is\ncommonly stated that our ‘power’ begins and ends with a determination that there is\nsubstantial evidence [citation], this does not mean we must blindly seize any evidence in\nsupport of the respondent in order to affirm the judgment. The Court of Appeal ‘was not\ncreated . . . merely to echo the determinations of the trial court. A decision supported by\na mere scintilla of evidence need not be affirmed on review.’ [Citation.] ‘[I]f the word\n“substantial” [is to mean] anything at all, it clearly implies that such evidence must be of\nponderable legal significance. Obviously the word cannot be deemed synonymous with\n“any” evidence. It must be reasonable . . . , credible, and of solid value . . . .’ [Citation.]\nThe ultimate determination is whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found for the\nrespondent based on the whole record. [Citation.] While substantial evidence may\nconsist of inferences, such inferences must be ‘a product of logic and reason’ and ‘must\nrest on the evidence’ [citation]; inferences that are the result of mere speculation or\nconjecture cannot support a finding [citations].” (Kuhn v. Department of General\nServices (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1627, 1633, footnote omitted, italics original.)\n       It is the appellant’s burden to establish that the judgment is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence. (Adoption of Allison C. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1011.) In\nmeeting that burden, the appellant is charged with presenting an adequate record from\nwhich the error is demonstrated. (Maria P. v. Riles (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1295.)\n“Defendants raising a claim of insufficiency of the evidence assume[] a ‘daunting\nburden.’ [Citation.]” (Whiteley v. Philip Morris, Inc. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 635, 678.)\nIn assessing whether substantial evidence supports the trial court’s factual findings, we\nconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. (Plumas\n                                              15\n\fCounty Dept. of Child Support Services v. Rodriguez (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1021,\n1026.)\n                       4.     Procedural Bar\n         As noted earlier, where the claim is the absence of sufficient evidence to support\nthe judgment, it is the appellant’s burden—not the respondent’s or the court’s—“to\nidentify and establish deficiencies in the evidence. [Citation.]” (Houng Que, Inc. v. Luu\n(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 400, 409 (Houng Que); see also Hickson v. Thielman (1956)\n147 Cal.App.2d 11, 14-15.) “ ‘The rule is well established that a reviewing court must\npresume that the record contains evidence to support every finding of fact, and an\nappellant who contends that some particular finding is not supported is required to set\nforth in his [or her] brief a summary of the material evidence upon that issue. Unless this\nis done, the error assigned is deemed to be waived. [Citation.] It is incumbent upon\nappellants to state fully, with transcript references, the evidence which is claimed to be\ninsufficient to support the findings.’ ” (In re Marriage of Fink (1979) 25 Cal.3d 877,\n887; see also Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1246 [“attack on the evidence\nwithout a fair statement of the evidence is entitled to no consideration when it is apparent\nthat a substantial amount of evidence was received on behalf of the respondent”].)\n         Moreover, “the burden [of appellant] to provide a fair summary of the evidence\n‘grows with the complexity of the record. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Boeken v. Philip\nMorris Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1640, 1658 (Boeken).) Thus, an appellant’s\nrecitation of only the evidence supporting its position does not comply with the\nrequirements of an appellant’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, and may result in\nthe appellate court disregarding the claim. (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971)\n3 Cal.3d 875, 881; Stewart v. Union Carbide Corp. (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 23, 34.)\n         EAR has not met its burden as appellant to provide a summary of the material\nevidence (including evidence favorable to respondent JMR) concerning the claims\nlitigated in the court trial. This failure is particularly pronounced in light of the wealth\n                                               16\n\fand complexity of the evidence adduced at trial. (See Boeken, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1658.) For instance, as seen from the recitation of facts, ante, there was a significant\namount of evidence presented by JMR—through the testimony of four employees or\nformer employees (Rivard, Hupaylo, Spade, and Thornton)—that EAR’s performance\nunder the two subcontracts hindered JMR’s ability to complete the prime contract and\nsignificantly delayed completion of the Project. Yet EAR, in its opening brief, does not\nmention that Hupaylo, Spade, or Thornton testified. EAR also fails to present Rivard’s\ntestimony that is unfavorable to EAR’s position, such as Rivard’s testimony that EAR’s\nfailure to install the air compressor caused significant delays to the Project. EAR’s\n“selective recitation of the record . . . is manifestly deficient,” and we may therefore treat\nits claim of error as waived. (In re Marriage of Fink, supra, 25 Cal.3d at p. 887.) But\neven if we were to consider EAR’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge as having not\nbeen waived, it nonetheless lacks merit.\n                     5.      Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Court’s Findings\n       JMR presented evidence from multiple sources that EAR’s breaches of the\nsubcontracts were a concurrent cause in the delay of the completion of the Project.\nSteven Hupaylo, JMR’s job superintendent, testified that JMR’s drywall work was\ndelayed by EAR’s performance. According to Hupaylo, JMR’s planned, methodical\napproach to building out the interior was “held . . . up . . . [by EAR’s] not having\nmaterials, not having skilled people, [and] not having any people sometimes. That was\nthe biggest single issue.” Because of the ongoing problems with EAR’s performance\nunder both subcontracts, JMR had to complete the drywall work in an inefficient,\npiecemeal fashion. Documentary evidence presented by JMR—including a number of\nwritten communications from Spade to EAR—confirmed that (1) EAR’s plumbing and\nelectrical work was behind schedule; (2) some of EAR’s plumbing work was done\ncontrary to specifications; (3) EAR had performed work without proper quality controls;\n(4) EAR had failed to timely deliver certain electrical products, thereby delaying the\n                                              17\n\fProject; (5) EAR was responsible for multiple deficient or late submittals that resulted in\nthe Corps withholding payment under the prime contract; and (6) EAR was responsible\nfor numerous punch list items as of January 2008 that, two months later, it had not yet\naddressed. Spade also confirmed in his testimony that EAR’s deficient performance\nunder both subcontracts had resulted in several significant punch list items at the end of\nthe Project. And Rivard testified that EAR’s failure to supply the air compressor delayed\nJMR’s performance under the prime contract. Furthermore, JMR’s retained construction\nmanagement expert, John Elmer, gave detailed testimony concerning EAR’s\nresponsibility for concurrent delays on the Project. Elmer opined that of the 180 days of\ncritical path delay, EAR was concurrently responsible for 142 days of delay. EAR\nneither challenged Elmer’s expert qualifications nor presented its own expert testimony\nto contradict Elmer’s opinions.\n       In urging there was no substantial evidence supporting the judgment, EAR\nemphasizes the testimony of its owner, Pendurthi. EAR argues that “Pendurthi provided\nclear, positive and rationally believable testimony that the Project delays . . . were caused\nin whole or in part by JMR itself.” It cites to Pendurthi’s testimony that delays related to\nthe drywall installation and to time and cost overruns were due to matters chargeable to\nJMR—i.e., the difficulty of achieving “level five” drywall finish and JMR’s choice of\nusing expensive, out-of-town labor. But as trier of fact, “[t]he trial court [was] the\nexclusive judge of the credibility of the witnesses.” (People v. Duncan (2008) 160\nCal.App.4th 1014, 1018; see generally Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil\nAppeals and Writs, supra, ¶ 8:54, p. 8-26.) The court was therefore free to discount or\nreject Pendurthi’s testimony as self-serving, lacking in specifics, or otherwise lacking\ncredibility. (See In re Ana C. (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 1317, 1329 [appellate court cannot\nsubstitute its assessment of witnesses’ credibility for the trial court’s credibility\nassessment].) It is clear the trial court did not credit Pendurthi’s testimony, finding in the\nstatement of decision, for instance, that (1) “Pendurthi’s contrary conclusory explanations\n                                              18\n\f[regarding disruption and delay caused by EAR in the framing and drywall phase we]re\nnot credible”; (2) “Pendurthi’s conclusion that JMR’s alleged late finishing of the drywall\ndelayed EAR’s work [wa]s illogical”; and (3) EAR’s failure to produce documentary\nevidence “to support Mr. Pendurthi’s testimony renders [his] testimony weak and\nunreliable.”4 The court thus accepted the evidence presented by JMR—particularly\nHupaylo’s testimony—concerning delays caused by EAR in connection with the metal\nframing and drywall phases of the Project. Further, while EAR stresses Pendurthi’s\ntestimony that JMR’s failure to have on-site quality control personnel for a period of time\nin the fall of 2006 caused delay, the trial court could have minimized or rejected this\ntestimony as well. Indeed, there was no evidence that this delay early in the Project,\nassuming its existence, was a delay under a critical path analysis.\n       EAR also argues that JMR’s damages expert, Juan Perez, provided testimony\nnegating JMR’s claim that EAR was responsible for delaying the project: EAR argues\nthat Perez “testified that JMR was the cause of concurrent Project delays—upwards of\n75% responsibility during a time in August 2007—for failing to timely submit\noutstanding Project submittals.” (Original emphasis.) But the date cited by EAR is\nmisstated. The correct date is August 2008, three months after the Corps accepted the\nProject. Perez called the several-months period after beneficial occupancy (May 14,\n2008) the “Project Closeout” period. And to the extent EAR’s argument is that Perez’s\ndamage calculation testimony should be disregarded because he admitted that JMR had\n“upwards of 75% responsibility” for delays in the critical path timeline, JMR conflates\n\n\n       4\n         The court, in its statement of decision, specifically rejected other testimony\npresented by Pendurthi, including his assertion that there were precontract discussions in\nwhich the parties plainly agreed that supplying an air compressor was outside the scope\nof EAR’s duties under the plumbing subcontract. Pendurthi testified at length concerning\nthis issue. But because EAR does not challenge the trial court’s finding against EAR and\nits award of damages to JMR concerning the air compressor, we do not recite that\ntestimony here.\n                                             19\n\ftwo distinct parts of Perez’s testimony. As discussed, post, Perez opined that EAR was\nresponsible for at least 75 percent of the delay damages sustained by JMR during the\n142-day period in which EAR and another subcontractor, Countywide, were concurrently\nresponsible for delays in the critical path timeline. Based upon EAR’s responsibility for\ndelays during this 142-day period, Perez calculated damages in the form of field overhead\nand Eichleay damages. The “Project Closeout” was a period of 13 weeks after the 142-\nday concurrent delay period. Perez testified that during this period when the Project was\nwinding down, there were a number of outstanding contractor submittals. Perez, on a\nweek-by-week basis, determined the total number of submittals on the Project, the\nnumber of outstanding EAR submittals, and then multiplied EAR’s percentage of total\nsubmittals by the total weekly field overhead. During the third week of May 2008, for\nexample, the total field overhead was $6,641.73, EAR was responsible for 43 percent of\nthe outstanding submittals (36 of 84) during that week, so EAR’s proportional liability\nfor the week was $2,855.94. During two weeks of August 2008, there were four\noutstanding submittals—one was EAR’s and three were JMR’s. Perez therefore allocated\n25 percent of the weekly overhead to EAR for each these two weeks. The fact that Perez\ndetermined that JMR had 75 percent responsibility for delays during two weeks of\nAugust 2008—and calculated damages based upon EAR’s 25 percent responsibility\nduring that period—has nothing to do with Perez assessment of damages based upon\nEAR’s concurrent delay responsibility for the 142-day period preceding the Corps’s\nacceptance of beneficial occupancy of the Project on May 14, 2008.\n      In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence of causation for the\ndelay, EAR argues, in one sentence of its opening brief, that JMR “was unable to provide\nsubstantial evidence as to any Project delay damages allegedly attributable to EAR.” We\nneed not address this conclusory, undeveloped legal argument. (Tilbury Constructors,\nInc. v. State Compensation Ins. Fund (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 466, 482 [appellate\narguments raised in perfunctory fashion are deemed forfeited].) We conclude EAR has\n                                            20\n\ffailed to sustain its burden of showing there was insufficient evidence to support the\njudgment.\n              B.     Challenges to the Calculation of Contract Damages\n       In the alternative to its sufficiency-of-the evidence challenge, EAR contests the\ncourt’s acceptance of the Eichleay formula of recovering home office overhead damages.\nEAR also contends the court erred in applying the modified total cost method of\ncalculating the cost associated with delays in the framing and drywall phase of the\nProject. We will address these two challenges after first identifying the appropriate\nstandards of review. At the outset, however, we will present a summary of the evidence\nconcerning JMR’s claims of damages.\n                     1.     Evidence Concerning Damages\n       JMR presented evidence of damages that involved four categories: (1) field\noverhead delay damages; (2) home office overhead (Eichleay delay damages); (3) delay\ndamages associated with the framing and drywall phase of the Project, utilizing the\nmodified total cost method; and (4) costs associated with EAR’s failure to supply an\napproved air compressor. We will not summarize the air compressor damages, since they\nare not at issue in this appeal. But given their interrelationship with the Eichleay delay\ndamages, we will review the evidence of field overhead damages even though those\ndamages are not directly challenged by EAR.\n                            a.     Field Overhead Damages\n       Daniel Spade, JMR’s project manager, testified that the Corps had rejected JMR’s\nrecovery of any extended overhead damages resulting from delays in the Project’s\ncompletion. The Corps rejected these damages because there were concurrent delays\ncaused by parties other than the Corps. At trial, JMR’s construction management expert,\nJohn Elmer, explained that when the owner of a public works project causes delay, and a\nsubcontractor or subcontractors concurrently cause delay, the owner may grant the\ngeneral contractor an extension of time to complete the project, but it will not grant the\n                                             21\n\fgeneral contractor compensable time (i.e., delay damages payable by the owner). Elmer\ntestified that under such circumstances, the general contractor will typically seek delay\ndamages from the subcontractor, under the theory that the general contractor “should\nhave recovered compensable time, but . . . was precluded from [doing so] because of [the\nsubcontractor’s] delay.”\n       Juan Perez, a construction expert retained by JMR, provided extensive testimony\nregarding JMR’s delay damages attributable to EAR. Defendants did not challenge\nPerez’s qualifications as an expert. Perez testified that he has had experience in\npresenting disruption claims on behalf of contractors. A disruption claim is based upon a\ncontractor’s intended performance or method of performance being impacted by another\ncontractor or by an event, resulting in the contractor’s performance being more costly\nbecause it is either done out of sequence or for an extended duration.\n       Perez calculated JMR’s damages based upon (1) his review of the project\ndocuments, and (2) his reliance upon the opinions of John Elmer, JMR’s construction\nmanagement expert. Specifically, Perez relied upon Elmer’s opinions that (1) there was a\ncritical path delay that extended the Project’s completion by 180 days; (2) 180 days is\nreflected in change orders issued by the Corps extending the Project’s completion date;\n(3) the parties responsible for the delays were the Corps and three subcontractors (EAR,\nCountywide Mechanical, and Del Monte Glass); (4) EAR and Countywide were each\nconcurrently responsible for 142 days of the 180 days of delay; (5) within the 142-day\nperiod, Del Monte Glass was concurrently responsible for 28 days of delay.\n       Perez opined that, under the two subcontracts combined, EAR was responsible for\nat least 75 percent of the delay damages sustained by JMR during the 142-day concurrent\ndelay period identified by Elmer. Perez arrived at this percentage allocation after\nconsidering (a) Elmer’s allocation of EAR’s responsibility for concurrent delays\n(63 percent); (b) a determination of EAR’s percentage of the total contract value of the\n\n\n                                            22\n\fmechanical, electrical, and plumbing trades (67 percent); and (c) the percentage of punch\nlist items for the 142-day concurrent delay period (83 percent).\n       Perez also rendered the opinion that JMR sustained field overhead damages\nassociated with EAR’s concurrent delay. Field overhead costs are the costs a contractor\nincurs in maintaining its field operations, including cost items such as storage trailers,\noffice trailers, and a job superintendent’s salary. Perez concluded that JMR’s total field\noverhead damages for which EAR was responsible was $161,851.33.\n                             b.     Home Office Overhead Damages\n       Perez testified that he calculated damages for JMR’s home office costs (otherwise\nknown as unabsorbed overhead costs) using the Eichleay formula. Perez explained that\nthis formula “is a method of allocating those home office overhead costs to a project that\n[has] been extended or delayed.” According to Perez, the Eichley formula is the\n“exclusive method approved by the Federal Government to arrive at the fair\ncompensation amount for unabsorbed overhead costs.” He testified that “[b]ut for the\nconcurrent delays on the project, the Eichleay [f]ormula would have been used by both\nJMR and the Government to arrive at the fair compensation amount for unabsorbed\noverhead costs that belonged to JMR.”\n                             c.     Framing and Drywall Phase Damages\n       JMR qualified its vice-president, Ron Rivard, as an expert witness in estimating\ninterior framing and drywall work. Rivard had over 30 years’ experience as a licensed\ngeneral contractor, and approximately 35 years as an estimator in which he had estimated\nat least 300 jobs.\n       Rivard testified that he prepared the bid for the framing and drywall phase of the\nProject. In doing so, he utilized the plans in an electronic format and used computer\nsoftware to perform a detailed cost takeoff. The takeoff yielded a bill of materials, and\nthe software automatically assigned a labor factor indicating the number of labor hours\nassociated with the particular area of work. The labor factor was based upon historical\n                                             23\n\fdata, i.e., JMR’s experience in constructing buildings similar to the building in the\nProject. The total bid for the framing and drywall phase was $220,000, an amount JMR\nassumed would be sufficient to perform the work in an orderly fashion and with a\nreasonable crew size. Rivard testified he was unaware of any mistakes in the bid, and\nopined that $220,000 was a reasonable cost for that phase of the Project.\n       Craig Connerty, a certified public accountant with 27 years of experience, testified\nas an expert on JMR’s behalf. JMR had been a client of Connerty’s accounting firm for\nover 15 years. Connerty reviewed the costs posted in JMR’s books allocated to the\nframing and drywall phase of the Project. He testified that the total costs allocated to this\nphase was $461,535, and he reviewed the subcategories of those costs. Connerty “did a\nlot of testing with regard to the accounts for reasonableness” by selecting a number of\ndifferent invoices for review before arriving at the $461,535 figure. Connerty also noted\nthat this figure should be reduced by approximately $48,200 to account for costs that,\nbased upon his conversation with Rivard, were erroneously posted to the framing and\ndrywall phase.\n       Perez offered testimony relating to disruption damages for the framing and\ndrywall phase. In forming his opinion, Perez spoke with job superintendent Steven\nHupaylo, project manager Daniel Spade, and JMR’s vice president Ron Rivard. Perez\nalso reviewed documents identifying the costs of the framing and drywall phase; certified\npayroll figures indicating the number of workers on the job site during that phase; and\nother correspondence. Perez relied on Hupaylo’s testimony to the effect “that every wall\nwas impacted by EAR’s performance, meaning that the impacts and the costs [were]\nintrinsically intertwined [and it was] difficult if not impractical or impossible to segregate\n[the] individual impacts.” In calculating disruption damages, Perez performed a\n“modified total cost analysis.” He described this approach as follows: “[Y]ou would\ntake a selected portion of the contractor’s costs that he incurred and subtract from that the\n\n\n                                             24\n\fcontractor’s budget for those items, removing . . . items which were not part of the\noriginal budget . . . to ensure you’re comparing apples to apples.”\n       Thus, one component of Perez’s calculation was the original bid. Perez did an\nindependent analysis of JMR’s bid for the framing and drywall phase. He found that\nRivard’s bid contained the kind of detail indicative of a good estimate, the bid used\nmethods that were “consistent with other contractors,” and the bid was “based on\nhistoric[al] information[,] which is also important.” Perez testified that he “was satisfied”\nwith Rivard’s bid and that the numbers within it “appeared reasonable.” He noted that in\ncomparing the material costs in the bid with the actual material costs, “the material\nestimate was almost dead on.” He also noted that because labor estimates are based upon\nthe material scheduled, the fact that the actual cost of materials was consistent with the\nestimate for those materials was “a good indication of a good estimate.” He concluded\nthat “if your material estimate is off, your labor estimate would be off. And Mr. Rivard’s\nmaterial estimate was on, was accurate.”\n       Perez also reviewed the “logged” costs that related to the framing and drywall\nphase of the Project. This amount totaled $461,534. Perez subtracted the costs that had\nbeen incorrectly allocated to the framing and drywall phase. These were the same figures\nidentified in the testimony of JMR’s accounting expert, Craig Connerty. Perez also\nsubtracted a per diem figure associated with the erroneously posted costs. Perez then\ncalculated the total amount of disruption damages allocable to EAR relating to the\nframing and drywall phase, which he determined to be $185,729.\n                     2.     Standards of Review\n       An appellant’s challenge to damages, depending upon its specific nature, may be\nsubject to a substantial evidence, abuse of discretion, or de novo standard of review. The\nquestion of whether a plaintiff was, in fact, damaged by the defendant’s breach of\ncontract is reviewed for substantial evidence. (See GHK Associates v. Mayer Group, Inc.\n(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 856, 873 (GHK).) The question of whether “a certain measure of\n                                             25\n\fdamages is permissible given the legal right the defendant has breached, is a matter of\nlaw, subject to de novo review. [Citation.]” (New West Charter Middle School v. Los\nAngeles Unified School Dist. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 831, 843 (New West); see also\nHurtado v. Superior Court (1974) 11 Cal.3d 574, 579.) But where the measure of\ndamages is legally permissible, a trial court’s choice of that measure, among other legally\npermissible measures of damages, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (New West, at\np. 843, citing GHK, at p. 873.)\n       EAR contends that neither the Eichleay formula nor the modified total cost\nmethod was legally authorized in this case. EAR does not make the further argument\nthat, assuming the legal validity of these damage calculations, the court abused its\ndiscretion by selecting them over other legally permissible methods of computing\ndamages. Accordingly, we review the legal propriety of the court’s use of the two\ndamages calculations de novo. In addition, EAR contends that, even assuming the legal\nvalidity of the Eichleay formula, JMR failed to establish the requisite elements for its\napplication, a question we review under the substantial evidence standard of review.\n                     3.     Challenges to the Eichleay Formula\n                            a.      The Eichleay Formula\n       As explained by JMR’s expert, Juan Perez, the Eichleay formula “is a method of\nallocating those home office overhead costs to a project that [have] been extended or\ndelayed.” It originated from a case before the Armed Services Board of Contract\nAppeals (see Eichleay Corp. (A.S.B.C.A.1960) 60-2 BCA (CCH) 2688), and it is\ntypically used in federal litigation involving federal public works projects. (See, e.g., P.J.\nDick Inc. v. Principi (Fed.Cir.2003) 324 F.3d 1364, 1370; Altmayer v. Johnson\n(Fed.Cir.1996) 79 F.3d 1129, 1132-1133 (Altmayer).) The Federal Circuit has held that\n“the Eichleay formula is the only means for calculating recovery for unabsorbed home\noffice overhead.” (E.R. Mitchell Const. Co. v. Danzig (Fed.Cir.1999) 175 F.3d 1369,\n1372, italics original; see also Nicon, Inc. v. U.S. (Fed.Cir.2003) 331 F.3d 878, 884.)\n                                             26\n\f       As explained by the Altmayer court: “Home office overhead costs are those that\nare expended for the benefit of the whole business, which by their nature cannot be\nattributed or charged to any particular contract. [Citation.] In contracting with the\ngovernment, a company necessarily includes a portion of home office overhead expenses,\nwhich it calculates based on the contract’s duration, in its estimate of costs to perform the\ncontract. [Citation.] When the government delays or disrupts contract performance,\nultimately requiring that it be extended, the contractor’s stream of income from the\ngovernment for the direct costs it has incurred under the contract is reduced or\ninterrupted. [Citation.] However, home office overhead continues to accrue throughout\nboth the original and extended performance periods, regardless of direct contract activity.\n[Citations.] This, of course, results in a reduction or interruption of payments for\noverhead, especially when, as here, the contractor has prepared a critical path schedule,\nfor any delay along the critical path results in the delay of the overall project.”\n(Altmayer, supra, 79 F.3d at p. 1132.)\n       There are three steps in the calculation of extended overhead using the Eichleay\nformula. They are (1) “to find [the] allocable contract overhead [by] multiply[ing] the\ntotal overhead cost incurred during the contract period times the ratio of billings from the\ndelayed contract to total billings of the firm during the contract period; [(2)] to get the\ndaily contract overhead rate, divide allocable contract overhead by days of contract\nperformance; and [(3)] to get the amount recoverable, multiply the daily contract\noverhead rate times days of government-caused delay. [Citation.]” (Wickham\nContracting Co., Inc. v. Fischer (Fed.Cir. 1994) 12 F.3d 1574, 1577, fn. 3 (Wickham\nContracting).)\n                             b.     Legal Propriety of Using Eichleay Formula\n       EAR argues it was improper for the court to accept JMR’s proffer of the Eichleay\nformula to establish its unabsorbed overhead damages caused by EAR’s concurrent\ndelay. EAR asserts there is no legal precedent for applying the formula because (1) there\n                                              27\n\fhave been no published California decisions endorsing its use, and (2) there is no legal\nauthority authorizing its use in situations, such as here, where the defendant causing the\ndelay was not the government. EAR also urges that Perez, JMR’s expert, “admitted\napplication of the Eichleay formula is ‘debated.’ ”5\n       Under Civil Code section 3300, a party may recover for a breach of contract a sum\nthat will compensate it “for all the detriment proximately caused thereby, or which, in the\nordinary course of things, will be likely to result therefrom.” “[I]n the law of contracts\nthe theory is that the party injured by a breach should receive as nearly as possible the\nequivalent of the benefits of performance. [Citations.] The aim is to put the injured party\nin as good a position as [it] would have been had performance been rendered as\npromised. This aim can never be exactly attained yet that is the problem the trial court is\nrequired to resolve. [Citation.]” (Brandon & Tibbs v. George Kevorkian Accountancy\nCorp. (1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 442, 454; see also Lewis Jorge Const. Management, Inc. v.\nPomona Unified School Dist. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 960, 967-968 (Lewis Jorge).) “Where\nthe fact of damages is certain . . . the amount of damages need not be calculated with\nabsolute certainty. The law requires only that some reasonable basis of computation be\nused, and the result reached can be a reasonable approximation.” (Acree v. General\nAcceptance Corp. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 385, 398, fns. omitted, italics in original\n(Acree); see also SCI Cal. Funeral Services, Inc. v. Five Bridges Foundation (2012)\n203 Cal.App.4th 549, 570 (SCI Cal. Funeral Services).)\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Perez was asked if there was any criticism of the Eichleay formula. He\nresponded: “I’m aware of . . . different cases—certainly Eichleay is a formula which is\nthe subject of a lot of cases and the application of Eichleay is debated and . . . it’s an\nevolving formula. And I try to keep up-to-date with the evolution of it, but that’s what\nI’m aware of.” After again being asked if he was aware of any criticisms of the formula,\nPerez responded: “Criticisms? Not criticisms more than just the applicability of it—of\nthe formula.”\n                                             28\n\f       Delay damages are a common element recoverable by a party aggrieved by the\nbreach of a construction contract. (See, e.g., Coughlin v. Blair (1953) 41 Cal.2d 587,\n603-604 [plaintiffs entitled to damages for increased building costs and loss of use of\nproperty resulting from defendants’ delay in performance of contract to pave road and\ninstall utilities]; State of California ex rel. Dept. of Transportation. v. Guy F. Atkinson\nCo. (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 25, 32-34 (Guy F. Atkinson) [contractor entitled to disruption\nand delay damages caused by material changes to contract ordered by state]; Bird v.\nAmerican Surety Co. (1917) 175 Cal. 625, 631 [delay damages incurred by owner,\nincluding rental losses, recoverable].) A subcontractor who is responsible for delaying\nthe progress of a construction project may be held liable for delay damages incurred by\nthe general contractor or by another subcontractor. (10 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate\n(3d ed. 2001) § 27:39, p. 109.) Increased overhead expenses incurred by a general\ncontractor as a result of the subcontractor’s breach may be an item of recoverable\ndamages. (See Allen v. Gardner (1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 335, 344.)\n       As explained in one treatise: “A building contractor whose performance is\ndelayed by the owner may have increased overhead and fixed costs resulting from a delay\nand may suffer labor and material cost increases or loss of labor productivity due to\ndelays for all of which he or she would be entitled to damages.” (Cal. Attorney’s Guide\nto Damages (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2014) § 1.49, p. 1-50.) Extended home office overhead\nis one type of delay damages for which a contractor may seek recovery. (See Cal.\nConstruction Contracts, Defects, and Litigation (Cont.Ed.Bar 2013) §§ 5.107, 6.86, pp.\n394, 537; Gibbs & Hunt, Cal. Construction Law (17th ed. 2011) Construction Claims,\n§ 6.07[F], p. 441.)\n       We acknowledge there are no reported California appellate decisions approving\nthe use of the Eichleay formula. In the only reported California case addressing the\nformula, the appellate court did not decide the legal propriety of its use because the\nmunicipality against which such damages were sought did not dispute the formula’s\n                                              29\n\fgeneral applicability to construction delay claims. (See Howard Contracting, Inc. v. G.A.\nMacDonald Construction Co., Inc. (1998) 71 Cal.App.4th 38, 53.)\n       We do not infer from the absence of California authority that the Eichleay formula\nis unavailable as proof of delay damages in this state. As has been observed in one\ntreatise: “The federal government developed the Eichleay formula to compute the\namount of home office overhead expense for which a government contractor should be\nreimbursed for a period of delay. Although the formula has not been discussed in a\nreported California case, it is frequently used at the trial court level and in arbitration\nproceedings to compute damages.” (Cal. Construction Contracts, Defects, and Litigation,\nsupra, § 5.107, p. 394.)6\n       That the circumstances of this case are different from those in which Eichleay\ndamages are typically discussed in reported decisions—i.e., the general contractor\nseeking delay damages from a subcontractor, rather than from a governmental\nagency/owner—does not preclude use of the formula. JMR presented unrebutted\ntestimony from Daniel Spade that because there were concurrent delays, the Corps\nrejected JMR’s effort to recover extended overhead damages from the Corps. And\nJMR’s construction management expert, John Elmer, testified that when the owner of a\npublic works project causes delay, but a subcontractor or subcontractors concurrently\ncause delay, the owner may grant the general contractor additional time but it will not\ngrant the general contractor compensable time (i.e., delay damages). Elmer testified that\nunder such circumstances, the general contractor will typically seek delay damages from\nthe subcontractor under the theory that the general contractor “should have recovered\n\n\n       6\n         We acknowledge it is stated elsewhere in the treatise that, because California\ncourts have not adopted the Eichleay formula in any published decision, “[t]he\napplicability of [it] to public or private construction projects in California is\nquestionable.” (Cal. Construction Contracts, Defects, and Litigation, supra, § 6.86,\np. 538.)\n                                              30\n\fcompensable time, but . . . was precluded from [doing so] because of [the\nsubcontractor’s] delay.” (See William F. Klingensmith, Inc. v. U.S. (Fed.Cir. 1984)\n731 F.2d 805, 809 [contractor generally denied recovery for government-caused delays\nwhere there are concurrent delays and absent “ ‘proof a clear apportionment of the delay\nand expense attributable to each . . .’ ”]; Gibbs & Hunt, Cal. Construction Law, supra,\nConstruction Claims, § 6.07[E], p. 440 [where owner causing project delays shows that\n“simultaneous cause of delay was the contractor’s own mismanagement of the project,”\nand delays “contributed to or overlapped the owner caused delays, then they may be\nconsidered concurrent and may be treated as noncompensable delays”].) EAR presented\nno expert testimony of its own to rebut JMR’s expert testimony concerning Eichleay\ndamages.\n       We conclude the trial court did not err in applying the Eichleay formula as a\nlegally permissible method of determining JMR’s home office overhead damages. We\nbase this conclusion upon the expert evidence presented at trial, the general recoverability\nof extended home office overhead as an element of delay damages, and the federal\ncourts’ general acceptance of the Eichleay formula. In other words, the calculation of\nextended home office overhead damages using the Eichleay formula was an appropriate\nmethod to compensate JMR “for all the detriment proximately caused” by EAR’s breach\nof contract. (Civ. Code, § 3300.) That recovery facilitates “[t]he goal [of placing] the\nplaintiff ‘in as good a position as he or she would have occupied’ if the defendant had not\nbreached the contract. [Citation.]” (Lewis Jorge, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 967, quoting 24\nWilliston on Contracts (4th ed.2002) § 64:1, p. 7.) Indeed, it would be anomalous to\nallow recovery to JMR for Eichleay extended home office overhead damages in a claim\nagainst the government-owner—had there been no concurrent delay and where, as here,\nJMR had established the fact of such damages and causation—while denying such\nrecovery from EAR where EAR was concurrently responsible for the delay.\n\n\n                                            31\n\f                             c.     Proof of Elements of Eichleay Formula\n       EAR also challenges the use of the Eichleay formula on the basis that JMR did not\nestablish the requisite elements for its application. The federal courts have identified\nthree Eichleay requirements. “[T]he contractor [must] establish: (1) a government-\ncaused delay; (2) that [the contractor] was on ‘standby’; and (3) that [the contractor] was\nunable to take on other work. [Citation.]” (Altmayer, supra, 79 F.3d at p. 1133.) EAR\nasserts there was no evidence JMR was unable to take on other work.\n       JMR presented evidence, through Perez, concerning JMR’s inability to obtain\nother work. Perez’s expert testimony was based in large part upon his conversations with\nRivard and JMR’s bonding agent, Sharon Rusconi. Perez testified that JMR was a\nwoman-owned business that received work on Small Business Administration Section 8A\nprojects. Such projects are not strictly bid competitively; contract awards are largely\ndependent on the contractor’s ratings. Perez testified that as a result of Project delays\nduring the 142-day concurrent delay period, JMR’s rating was downgraded to marginal.\nThis rating downgrade negatively impacted JMR’s ability to obtain new work. Rivard\ninformed Perez that during the period of November 2007 through sometime in 2008,\nJMR could not obtain a bid bond. JMR was thus precluded from bidding on public\nprojects and could not get other work.7\n       This evidence constituted substantial evidence of the third Eichleay prerequisite,\ni.e., “that [JMR] was unable to take on other work. [Citation.]” (Altmayer, supra,\n79 F.3d at p. 1133.) Accordingly, EAR’s claim that there was insufficient evidence\nsupporting application of the Eichleay formula fails.8\n\n       7\n          EAR did not assert any evidentiary objections at trial to this testimony, forfeiting\nany such objections on appeal. (See SCI Cal. Funeral Services, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 563-565 [appellant’s challenges to admissibility of expert testimony forfeited due\nto failure to preserve them in trial court].)\n        8\n          EAR also argues JMR’s damages were improperly calculated because Perez\nincluded impermissible expenses such as advertising and entertainment as part of its\n                                              32\n\f                      3.     Challenges to Modified Total Cost Method\n       EAR contends the court erred in several respects in using the modified total cost\nmethod in its award of delay damages relating to the framing and drywall phase. “The\ntotal cost method derives damages as the difference between a contractor’s actual costs\nand its original bid.” (Servidone Const. Corp. v. U.S. (Fed.Cir. 1991) 931 F.2d 860, 861.)\nIn the event some of the costs of the contractor are deemed unreasonable or were the\nresult of “its own errors or omissions, then those costs are subtracted from the damages to\narrive at a modified total cost. [Citation.]” (Dillingham-Ray Wilson v. City of Los\nAngeles (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1408 (Dillingham-Ray Wilson); see Annot., “Total\nCost Method (or Approach)” and “Modified Total Cost Method (or Approach)” to\nProving Damages in State Contract Cases (2004) 124 A.L.R.5th 375, 389 [modified total\ncost approach may be utilized where most damages are attributable to defendant and\n“contractor can isolate and quantify those damages that arose due to causes for which the\ncontractor is responsible”].) As explained by the California Supreme Court, to invoke the\ntotal cost method for recovering damages, a contractor must establish “(1) the\nimpracticality of proving actual losses directly; (2) [its] bid was reasonable; (3) its actual\ncosts were reasonable; and (4) it was not responsible for the added costs. [Citation.]”\n(Amelco Electric v. City of Thousand Oaks (2002) 27 Cal.4th 228, 243 (Amelco); see also\nid. at pp. 243-244 [“trial court bears the initial responsibility of determining that each\nelement of the four-part test” is satisfied].)\n       EAR, citing Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at page 243, contends the total cost method\nof computing damages “is generally disfavored” under the law. Although not favored,\nthe total cost method—along with its subcategory, the modified total cost method—has\nbeen recognized in California as an appropriate way of computing damages. (See, e.g.,\n\n\n\nhome office overhead. But Perez testified that the advertising and entertainment\nexpenses were insignificant and did not affect his calculation under the Eichleay formula.\n                                                 33\n\fGuy F. Atkinson Co., supra, 187 Cal.App.3d at p. 32; C. Norman Peterson C. v.\nContainer Corp. of America (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 628, 646-647; see also California\nCivil Jury Instruction (CACI) No. 4541.) Further, although our high court in Amelco—\nbecause the municipality did not contest the issue—declined to decide whether the total\ncost formula was an appropriate method of calculating damages in a breach of a public\ncontract case (Amelco, at p. 242), the Second District Court of Appeal, Division Two,\nconcluded that the Amelco court in fact upheld common law principles “permit[ting] a\npublic contractor to pursue either a total cost theory or a modified total cost theory.”\n(Dillingham-Ray Wilson, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at p. 1408.) The court reached this\nconclusion because Amelco cited Guy F. Atkinson, supra, 172 Cal.App.3d 25, and did not\ndisapprove of the result in that case. (Dillingham-Ray Wilson, at p. 1408.)\n       The California Supreme Court has emphasized that one of the major concerns in\nthe use of the total cost method is that it not be used as “ ‘a substitute for proof of\ncausation.’ [Citation.]” (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 244.) Here, there was\nsubstantial evidence of a causal connection between the extra cost JMR incurred in the\nProject’s framing and drywall phase and EAR’s breach of contract. Moreover, the\ncautionary statement in Amelco that the total cost method “ ‘should be applied only to the\nsmallest affected portion of the contractual relationship that can be clearly identified’\n[citation]” was heeded: JMR used the modified total cost method to calculate damages\nrelated only to the framing and drywall phase of the Project, not to damages related to the\nentire Project.\n       EAR also contends there was a lack of evidence to support a finding of the four\nprerequisites recited in Amelco (hereafter the Amelco elements) for use of the modified\ntotal cost method. As we discuss below, the trial court specifically addressed each of the\nAmelco elements in its statement of decision, and substantial evidence supported the\ncourt’s conclusions that JMR established each element.\n\n\n                                              34\n\f       The trial court specifically found JMR had established the first Amelco element—\n“the impracticality of proving actual losses directly.” (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at\np. 243.) In so concluding, the court cited the testimony of JMR’s job superintendent,\nSteven Hupaylo, which it found credible. As the court stated, Hupaylo had testified that\nJMR had a good design for performing the framing and drywall work, but he (Hupaylo)\n“had to wait for EAR to complete its rough-in work before he could complete the walls,\nand, because of EAR’s delays, he never had all four walls and a ceiling in any room to\nwork with.” The trial court concluded: “Consequently, the disruption occurred\nthroughout the entire period of that work, was not confined to one particular section or\ntime, so [it] could not be tracked specifically as the disruption occurred.” Furthermore,\nPerez testified, based upon Hupaylo’s testimony, that because “every wall was impacted\nby EAR’s performance, [this] mean[t] that the impacts and the costs are intrinsically\nintertwined [and it is] difficult if not impractical or impossible to segregate [the]\nindividual impacts.”\n       The trial court also found JMR had established the second Amelco element, i.e.,\nthe reasonableness of its bid. (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 243; see Gibbs & Hunt,\nCal. Construction Law, supra, Construction Claims, § 6.14[A], p. 471 [stressing the\nimportance of accuracy of bid estimate to contractor’s claim under total cost method].)\nThe court noted that (1) Rivard, as an expert experienced in estimating, testified\nconcerning his methodology for preparing his bid, and opined that the bid for the framing\nand drywall phase was reasonable; (2) Perez reviewed the bid, noted that Rivard’s\nmethodology was consistent with other contractors and was based upon historical\ninformation, and was satisfied it was accurate; (3) Perez opined the $220,000 stated in the\nbid was a reasonable cost for the framing and drywall phase; and (4) EAR offered no\nexpert testimony to rebut or contradict the reasonableness of the framing and drywall bid.\n       Likewise, the court concluded JMR’s actual costs for the framing and drywall\nphase were reasonable—the third Amelco element. (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 243.)\n                                              35\n\fIn concluding that “the actual costs were reasonable and accurately recorded,” the trial\ncourt cited to the testimony of JMR’s experts, Connerty and Perez. It noted that\nConnerty reviewed JMR’s costs associated with the framing and drywall phase, and that\nConnerty’s work was “substantial.” The trial court indicated that Connerty “did not just\naccept JMR’s numbers; he [‘]did a lot of testing[’] of the accounts for reasonableness by\nactually reviewing a number of invoices, and conducted an independent analysis.”\n       Finally, the trial court found JMR was not responsible for the added costs—the\nfourth Amelco element. (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 243.) It concluded EAR was\nsolely at fault for the disruption in the completion of the framing and drywall phase. The\ncourt cited the testimony of Hupaylo that because of EAR’s delays in “not having\nmaterials, not having skilled people, and sometimes not having any people working at all,\nJMR’s crews had to work piecemeal” and in an inefficient manner to complete the work.\nThe court “accept[ed] the testimony of Steve Hupaylo as accurate.” It also relied on\nPerez’s testimony that, based upon his review of certified payroll records, “the number of\n[EAR] workers reported on the certified payroll corresponded with the low percentage of\ncompletion.” Perez also testified that EAR’s rough-in work took four months to\ncomplete, notwithstanding that EAR had scheduled 34 days for the work. The trial court\nagreed with Perez’s “conclusion that . . . JMR was confronted with the incomplete work\nand stacking of trades, which disrupted its efficiency.”\n       EAR points to testimony it presented to suggest that JMR’s cost overruns were\ndue to its hiring of expensive out-of-town labor and the high level of quality required for\nthe drywall finish. But the trial court rejected these arguments. The court indicated in its\nstatement of decision that “Pendurthi’s contrary conclusory explanations [regarding the\nframing and drywall disruption we]re not credible,” and the court found Pendurthi’s\n“testimony weak and unreliable.” Moreover—as was the case with JMR’s presentation\nof Eichleay damages—EAR offered no expert testimony to contradict JMR’s showing\n\n\n                                             36\n\fthat the modified total cost method was appropriate for calculating its damages associated\nwith the framing and drywall phase.\n       As a variant of its contention that the court erred in concluding JMR was not\nresponsible for the added cost, EAR argues, quoting from Amelco at p. 246, that damages\nwere not recoverable under this method because JMR did not “ ‘distinguish between\nthose inefficiencies that were [JMR’s] and those believed to be the responsibility of the\n[Army] (and presumably other prime contractors and subcontractors).’ ” But the court\nrejected EAR’s contention that JMR was responsible for inefficiencies in the framing and\ndrywall phase, and there was substantial evidence to support the court’s conclusion.\n       Lastly, EAR contends the disruption damages awarded by the court were\n“admittedly inaccurately calculated” because they failed to account for a $90,000\nmiscoding error about which Rivard testified. This argument relates to cross-examination\nin which defendants’ counsel asked if Rivard had given prior deposition testimony to the\neffect that there was an approximate $90,000 miscoding of costs that were not related to\nthe framing and drywall phase of the Project. Defendants raised this issue twice in their\nposttrial briefing. The trial court addressed this contention in its statement of decision.\nThe court concluded that Rivard’s deposition testimony concerning the “$90,000 coding\novercharge” was essentially superseded by testimony from Perez and Connerty that,\nshortly before trial, Rivard advised them that the adjustment for miscoded items was\napproximately $48,200.9 The trial court thus characterized the $90,000 coding error as a\n“relatively unfocused pre-trial examination estimate” that did not warrant further\nconsideration in its award of damages. Giving deference to the court’s role as trier of\n\n\n       9\n        The statement of decision recites that the figure given by Rivard to Perez and\nConnerty shortly before trial was “a final $428,200 adjustment for items that were\nproperly counted for tasks other than metal studs and drywall.” This is an obvious\ntypographical error, as Connerty testified the figure was “$48,200 and something” and\nPerez testified the figure was $48,262.\n\n                                             37\n\ffact, we conclude there was no error in disregarding the purported $90,000 coding error\nin determining JMR’s disruption damages.\n       We thus conclude there was no legal impediment to JMR’s use of the modified\ntotal cost method of calculating its damages associated with the framing and drywall\nphase of the Project. The trial court was justified in concluding that JMR had established\neach of the four Amelco elements required for utilizing this method. (Amelco, supra,\n27 Cal.4th at p. 243.) The fact that the damages claimed using this formula may have\nonly been a reasonable approximation of JMR’s loss associated with this phase of the\nProject is not an obstacle to its use, since the fact of such damages was established by\nsubstantial evidence. (Acree, supra, 92 Cal.App.4th at p. 398.)\n              C.     EAR’s Challenges to the Statement of Decision\n       Interwoven throughout its briefs on appeal is EAR’s challenge to the legal\nsufficiency of the trial court’s statement of decision. Citing repeatedly to Duff v. Duff\n(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 781—a case that predated by 14 years the Legislature’s\namendment of section 632 to provide a procedure governing statements of decision in\ncivil trials (see Stats. 1981, ch. 900, § 1, p. 3425)—EAR claims that because of the\ncourt’s alleged failure to make findings, “reversal of the Judgment . . . is compelled.” We\nconclude the statement of decision is legally sufficient..\n       Section 632 provides in relevant part: “The court shall issue a statement of\ndecision explaining the factual and legal basis for its decision as to each of the principal\ncontroverted issues at trial upon the [timely] request of any party appearing at the trial.”\nThe statement of decision need only “ ‘state ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.’ ” (In\nre Marriage of Garrity and Bishton (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 675, 686.) The court is not\nrequired “to make an express finding of fact on every factual matter controverted at trial,\nwhere the statement of decision sufficiently disposes of all the basic issues in the case.\n[Citations.]” (Bauer v. Bauer (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1118 (Bauer).) Stated\notherwise, “[a] statement of decision need not address all the legal and factual issues\n                                             38\n\fraised by the parties. Instead, it need do no more than state the grounds upon which the\njudgment rests, without necessarily specifying the particular evidence considered by the\ntrial court in reaching its decision. [Citations.]” (Muzquiz v. City of Emeryville (2000)\n79 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1124-1125 (Muzquiz).) As this court has stated, “ ‘ “[u]ltimate\nfact[]” ’ is a slippery term, but in general it refers to a core fact, such as an element of a\nclaim or defense, without which the claim or defense must fail. [Citation.] It is\ndistinguished conceptually from ‘evidentiary facts’ and ‘conclusions of law.’ [Citation.]”\n(Yield Dynamics, Inc. v. TEA Systems Corp. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 547, 559 (Yield\nDynamics).)\n       After the court issued its tentative decision on April 30, 2012, defendants\nsubmitted a request for a statement of decision and a 72-item list of purported\ncontroverted issues they wished to have addressed. At the court’s direction in its\ntentative ruling, JMR submitted a proposed statement of decision on May 29, 2012.\nFollowing receipt of defendants’ objections to JMR’s proposed statement of decision, the\ncourt signed a 23-page statement of decision on July 19, 2012.\n       In its opening brief, EAR identifies 16 “controverted issues” the court allegedly\nfailed to address. EAR argues the failure to address these issues requires reversal of the\njudgment.10 We have reviewed each of these “controverted issues.” Like the\ncontroverted issues this court considered in Yield Dynamics, EAR’s issues are\n\n\n       10\n         EAR states in its opening brief that “JMR’s proposed statement of decision\n[ultimately adopted by the court] failed to provide written findings on not less than fifty-\none (51) controverted issues raised in EAR’s request.” But EAR identifies and provides\nargument relative to only 16 of the “controverted issues” it contends the court failed to\naddress. We need not identify or discuss the remaining 35 “controverted issues”\npurportedly not addressed by the court in its statement of decision. (Dills v. Redwoods\nAssociates, Ltd. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 888, 890, fn. 1 [appellate court has no obligation\nto “develop the appellants’ arguments for them”]; see also In re S.C. (2006)\n138 Cal.App.4th 396, 406 [appellate court is not required to search the record in order to\ndiscover support for the litigant’s position].)\n\n                                               39\n\f“compound, argumentative, tendentious, or vague, reading more like interrogatories”\nthan “controverted issues” properly identified under section 632. (Yield Dynamics,\nsupra, 154 Cal.App.4th at p. 558.)\n       Contrary to EAR’s assertions, some of the identified issues were specifically\naddressed by the trial court in its statement of decision. For instance, the trial court\naddressed, in several different places, the following purportedly unaddressed issue: “4)\nHow did EAR’s acts or omissions allegedly constituting a material breach of the\nPlumbing Subcontract cause JMR any damage?”11 Other issues—essentially\ninterrogatories—asked the trial court to cite legal authority in support of various aspects\nof its decision. Several issues were compound, argumentative and tendentious. For\ninstance, one request (issue “58”) asked the court to identify the “legal authority [under\nwhich] EAR [is] responsible for JMR’s own delays to the project where the Army Corps\nof Engineers recognized that JMR was 5% behind schedule, that JMR’s three phase\ninspections were ‘lacking,’ that JMR’s superintendence was ‘lacking,’ that JMR was\n‘working without activity hazard analysis,’ and where JMR had ‘inadequate site\nsupervision.’ ” And some of the issues invited the court to provide specific evidentiary\ndetail unnecessary to explaining the court’s decision.\n       As noted earlier, the trial court was only required to address “ ‘ultimate rather than\nevidentiary facts’ ” in its statement of decision. (Muzquiz, supra, 79 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1125, quoting In re Cheryl E. (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 587, 599; see also Hellman v. La\n\n\n       11\n          Other issues identified by EAR and addressed by the trial court include:\n(1) issue “26,” concerning whether Perez’s calculation of disruption damages had taken\ninto consideration a $90,000 “miscalculat[ion]”; (2) issue “66,” concerning whether JMR\nwas responsible for any of the disruption damages it claimed; (3) issue “68,” concerning\nwhether JMR’s bid contemplated JMR’s using out-of-town labor, performing work out of\nsequence, or extra cost associated with achieving a “ ‘level-five drywall finish’ ”; and\n(4) issue “65,” concerning whether JMR’s disruption damages were capable of\ncalculation with certainty.\n\n                                              40\n\fCumbre Golf & Country Club (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1224, 1230.) It was not required to\ngive a point-by-point response to a party’s statement of purported controverted issues.\n(Ermoian v. Desert Hospital (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 475, 498; In re Marriage of Burkle\n(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 712, 736, fn. 15.) The trial court’s statement of decision\n“sufficiently dispose[d] of all the basic issues in the case” (Bauer, supra, 46 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 1118) and adequately “state[d] the grounds upon which the judgment rest[ed]”\n(Muzquiz, supra, 79 Cal.App.4th at p. 1125).\n       II.    SureTec’s Challenge to the Judgment Due to Lack of Default Notice\n       SureTec contends the trial court erred in finding it liable under the performance\nbonds because JMR failed to give it (SureTec) notice of EAR’s default under the\nsubcontracts. SureTec argues that a “declaration of default was a condition precedent to\nSureTec’s liability.” It also argues that, looking at the language of the bonds as a whole,\nthere was an implied requirement that JMR provide a notice of default to SureTec as a\ncondition precedent to SureTec’s liability under the bonds.\n       There was undisputed evidence, based upon Rivard’s testimony, that JMR did not\nformally declare EAR in default under either subcontract. Nor did JMR ask SureTec to\ncomplete the bonded work under either subcontract. At trial, Cynthia Vincent, a SureTec\nvice-president, testified that SureTec received no notice of any default under the\nplumbing or electrical subcontracts. She also testified that SureTec was not given the\nopportunity to complete work under either subcontract, and that JMR never asked\nSureTec to obtain new plumbing or electrical subcontractors.\n              A.     Contractual Conditions Generally\n       A conditional obligation is one in which “the rights or duties of any party thereto\ndepend upon the occurrence of an uncertain event.” (Civ. Code, § 1434; see also Rest.2d,\nContracts, § 224: “A condition is an event, not certain to occur, which must occur, unless\nits non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due.”)\n“[P]arties may expressly agree that a right or duty is conditional upon the occurrence or\n                                            41\n\fnonoccurrence of an act or event.” (Platt Pacific, Inc. v. Andelson (1993) 6 Cal.4th 307,\n313 (Platt Pacific).) A condition in a contract may be a condition precedent, concurrent,\nor subsequent. (Civ. Code, § 1435.) “[A] condition precedent is either an act of a party\nthat must be performed or an uncertain event that must happen before the contractual\nright accrues or the contractual duty arises.” (Platt Pacific, at p. 313; see also Civ. Code,\n§ 1436.)\n       “The existence of a condition precedent normally depends upon the intent of the\nparties as determined from the words they have employed in the contract. [Citation.]”\n(Realmuto v. Gagnard (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 193, 199.) But “stipulations in an\nagreement are not to be construed as conditions precedent unless such construction is\nrequired by clear, unambiguous language; and particularly so where a forfeiture would be\ninvolved or inequitable consequences would result. [Citations.]” (Alpha Beta Food\nMarkets v. Retail Clerks Union Local 770 (1955) 45 Cal.2d 764, 771 (Alpha Beta Food);\nsee also Rubin v. Fuchs (1969) 1 Cal.3d 50, 53 [contract provisions are not construed as\nconditions precedent in the absence of language plainly requiring such construction]; City\nof San Diego v. Haas (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 472, 493.) Because “such conditions are\nnot favored by the law, [they] are to be strictly construed against one seeking to avail\n[it]self of them. [Citation.]” (Antonelle v. Kennedy & Shaw Lumber Co. (1903) 140 Cal.\n309, 315.)\n              B.     Interpretation of the Contract Language\n       Resolution of SureTec’s contention that a notice of default was a condition\nprecedent to its liability requires an independent review of the trial court’s interpretation\nof the bonds, since no extrinsic evidence was introduced by the parties on that question.\n(Campbell v. Scripps Bank (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1336; see also Airlines\nReporting Corp. v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1458,\n1461 [appellate court reviews interpretation of bonds de novo].)\n\n\n                                              42\n\f       “A surety bond is a ‘ “written instrument executed by the principal and surety in\nwhich the surety agrees to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of the principal.” ’\n[Citation.]” (American Contractors Indem. Co. v. Saladino (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th\n1262, 1268.) In the suretyship context, “the risk of loss remains with the principal, while\nthe surety merely lends its credit so as to guarantee payment or performance in the event\nthat the principal defaults. [Citation.] In the absence of default, the surety has no\nobligation. [Citation.]” (Cates Construction, Inc. v. Talbot Partners (1999) 21 Cal.4th\n28, 38 (Cates Construction).) A performance bond, a species of a surety bond, is one in\nwhich the surety “guarantee[s] that obligations undertaken by the principal will be\ncompleted under the terms of the bonded contract.” (1 Baier et al., Cal. Mechanics Liens\nand Related Construction Remedies (Cont.Ed.Bar 4th ed. 2014) Private Works Remedies,\n§ 2.115, p. 145.) When the principal breaches its contract with the bond’s beneficiary\n(i.e., the owner, or, in this case, the general contractor), “generally the surety’s liability\nhas been found to be coextensive with that of its principal. If the principal is liable under\nthe contract, the surety is liable under the performance bond. [Citation.]” (Ibid.) This\nmay include, in the event of the principal’s default, the surety’s liability under the bond\nfor “damages attributable to [its] principal[’s] delay in performing [a] construction\ncontract. [Citations.]” (Cates Construction, at p. 41.)\n       A surety contract is interpreted pursuant to the same rules that govern the\ninterpretation of contracts generally. (Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. City of Berkeley\n(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 145, 150 (Pacific Employers), citing United States Leasing Corp.\nv. DuPont (1968) 69 Cal.2d 275, 284; Civ. Code, § 2837.) To determine the surety’s\nliability, “we look first to the express terms of the performance bond. [Citations.]”\n(Cates Construction, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 39.) Performance bonds typically\nincorporate by reference the general contract or subcontract for which the bond was\nissued. As such, “ ‘the bond and the contract should be read together and construed fairly\nand reasonably as a whole according to the intention of the parties.’ [Citations.]” (Id. at\n                                               43\n\fpp. 39-40; see also Pacific Employers, at p. 150 [generally, “contract performance bond\nwill be read with the contract”].)\n          Each subcontract here requires EAR to furnish JMR, as the named obligee, a\nperformance bond and a payment bond “to secure the faithful performance of the\nSubcontract Work and to satisfy all Subcontractor payment obligations related to the\nSubcontract Work.” On November 10, 2006, SureTec issued separate performance bonds\nfor EAR’s electrical subcontract and its plumbing subcontract, listing the penal amounts\nof the bonds as $732,500 and $471,881, respectively. Each performance bond\nspecifically incorporates by reference the respective subcontract for which the bond was\nissued.\n          The one-page “Articles” of the two performance bonds contain identical language.\nArticle 1, containing the heading “SCOPE OF BOND” (emphasis omitted), states: “The\nPrincipal [EAR] and the Surety [SureTec], jointly and severally, bind themselves . . . to\nthe Obligee [JMR] for the performance of the Subcontract.” Under the heading\n“EFFECT OF OBLIGATION” (emphasis omitted), Article 2 provides: “If the Principal\nperforms the Subcontract, then this bond shall be null and void; otherwise it shall remain\nin full force and effect.” Article 4, under the heading “PRINCIPAL DEFAULT”\n(emphasis omitted), provides: “Whenever the Principal shall be, and is declared by the\nObligee to be in default under the Subcontract, with the Obligee having performed its\nobligations in the Subcontract, the Surety may promptly remedy the default, or shall\npromptly” (1) “[c]omplete the Subcontract in accordance with its terms and conditions”;\n(2) retain a new subcontractor to complete the Principal’s work under the subcontract;\n(3) pay the Obligee the amount for which the Surety is liable; or (4) deny liability in\nwhole or in part, providing an explanation for doing so.\n          Each subcontract details JMR’s right to deduct or withhold payments to EAR, and\nJMR’s rights in the event of EAR’s breach. Furthermore, each subcontract specifically\nrequires JMR to provide written notice to EAR in a number of circumstances. Those\n                                             44\n\fcircumstances include where (1) JMR elects to deduct from amounts otherwise due to\nEAR any sums EAR owes JMR; (2) JMR “deems it necessary and desirable to [withhold\npayments due to EAR to] protect itself against possible loss or damages”; (3) JMR\nconcludes EAR has failed to (a) supply sufficient skilled workers, (b) adhere to the work\nschedule, (c) pay workers or suppliers, (d) follow the law, or (e) has otherwise materially\nbreached the subcontract, requiring JMR to give EAR notice to cure the default; (4) JMR\nelects to suspend EAR’s work under the subcontract; (5) the owner suspends its\nagreement with JMR; (6) JMR elects to terminate the subcontract due to EAR’s material\ndefault of its obligations under the subcontract, after having given EAR written notice to\ncure; and (7) the owner terminates its agreement with JMR. None of these notice\nprovisions requires JMR to give written notice to the surety, SureTec. Furthermore, each\nsubcontract provides that the surety need not be advised of any changes, additions, or\nomissions to the subcontract.\n              C.     Discussion\n       SureTec implicitly acknowledges that neither performance bond expressly\nprovides that JMR must give notice to SureTec of EAR’s default as a condition precedent\nto SureTec’s liability. But it asserts that “[a] contractual provision need not be expressly\nlabeled ‘condition precedent’ to be treated as such. Rather, whether a provision is a\ncondition precedent is to be determined from the whole contract, its purpose, and the\nintention of the parties.” Quoting from Wal-Noon Corp. v. Hill (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d\n605, 611 (Wal-Noon), SureTec contends the default notice as a condition precedent ‘may\nbe necessarily implied in the language of [the] contract . . .’ ” Applying principles of\ncontract interpretation, we conclude that JMR was not required to give SureTec notice of\nEAR’s default as a condition precedent to SureTec’s liability on the bonds.\n       The only notice language in the bonds is found in Article 3, where SureTec\nexpressly “waive[d] notice of any alteration or extension of the Subcontract, including\nbut not limited to the Subcontract price and/or time, made by the Obligee [JMR].”\n                                             45\n\f(Italics added.) And the default provisions in the subcontracts—incorporated by\nreference into the bonds—include requirements in several instances that JMR give notice\nto EAR without any similar requirement of giving notice to SureTec. Thus, the bonds do\nnot contain the requisite “clear, unambiguous language” (Alpha Beta Food, supra,\n45 Cal.2d at p. 771) that would support a finding that JMR was required to provide a\nnotice of default to SureTec as a condition precedent to liability under the bonds.\n       Pacific Allied v. Century Steel Products (1958) 162 Cal.App.2d 70 (Pacific Allied)\nis instructive. There, the defendant (Century) agreed to fabricate and sell steel forms to\nplaintiff (Pacific) for the purpose of using them to install storm drains. (Id. at p. 72.)\nCentury also guaranteed that Pacific’s labor costs, through its use of Century’s steel\nforms, would not exceed four cents per square foot, and that Century would, upon\ncompletion of the job and Pacific’s submission of an itemized cost breakdown, pay\nPacific’s labor costs in excess of four cents per square foot. (Id. at p. 73.) Pacific agreed\nto keep a detailed account of labor costs and give Century a “continuous report.” (Ibid.)\nPacific kept Century apprised of costs during the project and gave it periodic oral reports,\nbut it did not provide a detailed cost breakdown upon the project’s completion. (Id. at\np. 78.) The court rejected Century’s contention that Pacific was required to provide a\ndetailed cost breakdown as a condition precedent to its recovery under the contract. (Id.\nat pp. 79-80.) The appellate court held that (1) conditions precedent are not favored in\nthe law; (2) neither the express terms of the contract nor a reasonable implication drawn\nfrom them compelled a finding that providing the cost breakdown was condition\nprecedent to Pacific’s recovery; and (3) the interpretation advanced by Century was\nparticularly disfavored because it would result in a forfeiture. (Id. at pp. 79-80.)\n       Here, as in Pacific Allied, there was no language expressly conditioning SureTec’s\nperformance under the bonds upon receipt of a notice of default from JMR. In Pacific\nAllied, there was an express agreement by the plaintiff to provide some level of\n\n\n                                              46\n\fnotification (a detailed cost breakdown) to the defendant. Here, there was no such\nexpress covenant requiring JMR to provide any notice to SureTec.\n       We conclude that SureTec’s receipt of a declaration of default by JMR is not a\ncondition precedent to triggering SureTec’s liability under the bonds. This interpretation\nnecessarily defeats SureTec’s argument that a condition precedent should be implied\nfrom the language of the bonds. This interpretation is also consistent with the statutory\nmandate that courts, in construing an instrument, shall “ ‘not [] insert what has been\nomitted, or [] omit what has been inserted.’ ” (Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP (2008)\n44 Cal.4th 937, 954, quoting § 1858; see also Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Robert S.\n(2001) 26 Cal.4th 758, 763 [applying § 1858 to reject insurer’s contention that illegal act\nexclusion in homeowner’s insurance policy should be construed as a “criminal act”\nexclusion, observing that if insurer had “wanted to exclude criminal acts from coverage,\nit could have easily done so”].)\n       Likewise, our construction comports with the law governing suretyships. “A\nsuretyship obligation is to be deemed unconditional unless its terms import some\ncondition precedent to the liability of the surety.” (Civ. Code, § 2806; see Bank of\nAmerica v. McRae (1947) 81 Cal.App.2d 1, 7 [“guaranty is unconditional unless its terms\nimport some condition precedent to the liability of the guarantor”].) Here, Article 1 of\neach bond creates the unconditional obligation to the effect that EAR and SureTec\n“jointly and severally, bind themselves . . . to [JMR] for the performance of the\nSubcontract.”\n       SureTec contends that, notwithstanding Article 1, its obligation here was\ndischarged under Article 2 of the performance bonds, which reads: “If the Principal\nperforms the Subcontract, then this bond shall be null and void; otherwise it shall remain\nin full force and effect.” SureTec asserts that because EAR performed its obligations by\ncompleting its work under the subcontracts, the bonds became “null and void” under\nArticle 2. This contention has no merit.\n                                            47\n\f       As discussed in detail, ante, the trial court found, based upon substantial evidence,\nthat EAR breached the plumbing and electrical subcontracts by, among other things,\ndelayed performance under the contracts and by disrupting the efficient completion of the\nframing and drywall phase of the Project. EAR’s breach gave JMR the option to\nterminate the subcontracts, but it was not required to do so. (See Whitney Inv. Co. v.\nWestview Development Co. (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 594, 602.) That JMR did not\nterminate the subcontracts as a result of EAR’s breach does not absolve EAR of\nresponsibility for breaching the contracts. “[Breach of contract d]amages for delay can\nresult from either a total or partial failure of performance. In both cases, delay damages\nare an extra item of recovery in addition to the normal measure of damages. However,\neven when there has been complete performance of a contract, damages for delay can\nresult when performance was not completed on time.” (Cal. Attorney’s Guide to\nDamages, supra, § 1.49, pp. 1-49 to 1-50.)\n       Furthermore, under general suretyship law, Civil Code section 2807 provides that\n“[a] surety who has assumed liability for payment or performance is liable to the creditor\nimmediately upon the default of the principal, and without demand or notice.” (Italics\nadded; see Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group\n2015) ¶ 6:3436, pp. 6I-72 to 6I-73 [“if the bond is silent, the obligee is not required to\ngive the surety notice of the principal’s default or make demand upon the surety for\npayment”].)\n       Thus, for instance, in State Bd. of Equalization v. Balboa Ins. Co. (1978)\n89 Cal.App.3d 499, the surety was held liable on sales tax surety bonds after the\nprincipal’s default, notwithstanding the obligee’s (State Board of Equalization’s) failure\nto make demand for payment or its failure to include the surety on a notice of lien. (Id. at\npp. 503-504.) The court explained that when the surety executed the surety bonds, “it did\nnot put conditions of special or separate notice” upon its “agreement to stand good for\n[the principal’s] tax liability.” (Id. at p. 504.) Citing Civil Code section 2807, the court\n                                             48\n\fheld the surety was liable under the bonds because neither the law nor the agreement\nrequired notice as a condition to the surety’s liability. (Ibid.)\n       SureTec relies on several out-of-state cases to support its contention that a\ndeclaration of EAR’s default by JMR to SureTec was a condition precedent to JMR’s\nrecovery under the bonds. Several of these cases were based upon the courts’\ninterpretation of the relevant contracts under applicable Florida law. (See, e.g., L&A\nContracting v. Southern Concrete Services (5th Cir. 1994) 17 F.3d 106 (L&A\nContracting); School Bd. of Escambia County v. TIG Premier Ins. Co. N.D.Fla. 2000)\n110 F.Supp.2d 1351; DCC Constructors, Inc. v. Randall Mechanical, Inc. (Fla.Ct.App.\n2001) 791 So.2d 575.) In L&A Contracting—a case relied upon by a number of the\nauthorities cited by SureTec—the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that a\ncontractor’s unequivocal declaration of the subcontractor’s default was “a necessary\nprecondition” to the surety’s liability under a performance bond. (L&A Contracting, at\np. 111; cf Colorado Structures Inc. v. Ins. Co. of the West (Wash. 2007) 167 P.3d 1125,\n1134 [disagreeing with L&A Contracting, concluding that a proper interpretation of the\nbond’s language in that case is that it created “liability, subject to a single express\ncondition subsequent (the principal’s prompt and faithful performance)”]; Walter\nConcrete Const. Corp. v. Lederle Labs. (N.Y. 2003) 788 N.E.2d 609, 610 [rejecting\nsurety’s claim that default notice was required, holding that had parties wished to make\nliability conditioned on default notice, they could have expressly so provided in\nperformance bond].) But L&A Contracting, and other cases relied on by SureTec, did not\ninvolve a contractual interpretation of performance bonds under California law. And\nnone of those authorities considered the appropriateness of implying a condition\nprecedent relating to default notice in light of decisional authority prohibiting such a\nconstruction unless the contractual language plainly requires it. (See Rubin v. Fuch,\nsupra, 1 Cal.3d at p. 53; Alpha Beta Food, supra, 45 Cal.2d at p. 771.) Indeed, L&A\nContracting does not discuss conditions precedent generally or the appropriateness of\n                                              49\n\fimplying a condition not expressly stated in a contract. We therefore decline to follow\nthe out-of-state authorities relied upon by SureTec. (See People v. Uribe (2011)\n199 Cal.App.4th 836, 865, fn. 15 [California courts not bound by out-of-state decisional\nauthority].)\n       We read the performance bonds together with the subcontracts to which they relate\nin ascertaining the intentions of the parties. (Cates Construction, supra, 21 Cal.4th at\npp. 39-40.) A number of provisions in the EAR subcontracts require JMR to give notice\nto EAR; none of these provisions requires notice to SureTec. The performance bonds\nthemselves contain no express requirement of any notice to the surety. The only mention\nof notice in either bond is a provision under which SureTec waives notice of any\nalteration or extension of the referenced subcontract. Reading Article 1 together with\nArticle 2 of each bond—in conjunction with the language of the subcontracts\nincorporated by reference—yields the conclusion that SureTec’s obligation to JMR in the\nevent of EAR’s breach of the underlying subcontract is unconditional. (See id. at p. 41\n[considering the documents “as a whole, the bond and underlying construction contract\nare fairly and reasonably read as requiring” surety to answer for principal’s failure to\nperform under contract].)\n       We conclude the performance bonds did not require JMR to give notice of default\nto SureTec as a condition precedent to recovery under the bonds. Any interpretation of\nthe bonds as implying such a condition precedent would be contrary to (1) suretyship\nprinciples (see Civ. Code, §§ 2806, 2807), and (2) the principle that conditions precedent\nshould not be implied unless the construction is compelled by the clear language of the\nagreement, particularly here, where such an implied condition would result in a\nforfeiture. (Alpha Beta Food, supra, 45 Cal.2d at p. 771.)12\n\n       12\n          SureTec also cites Wal-Noon, supra, 45 Cal.App.3d 605 in support of its\nposition that notice of default to SureTec was an implied condition precedent to recovery\nunder the performance bonds. But Wal-Noon involved a landlord-tenant dispute in\n                                             50\n\f       III.   The Attorney Fee Order\n       Defendants separately challenge the postjudgment order awarding JMR attorney\nfees in defending EAR’s cross-complaint. EAR asserts that the underlying premise of the\ncourt’s decision—that JMR prevailed on the cross-complaint—is faulty. It argues that it\n“clearly and unambiguously prevailed” on the two causes of action for breach of contract\nalleged in its cross-complaint. SureTec contends the award of attorney fees against it was\nlegally improper because the scope of its liability under the performance bonds did not\nextend to attorney fees incurred by JMR to defend the unmeritorious cross-complaint\nfiled by SureTec’s principal, EAR. We must consider initially whether defendants’\nclaims are cognizable on appeal. (See Jennings v. Marralle (1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 126\n[appellate court required to address sua sponte the question of appealability “whenever a\ndoubt exists” concerning the issue].)\n       After entry of judgment, JMR filed a motion for attorney fees awardable as costs\npursuant to Civil Code section 1717 (attorney fee motion). On November 9, 2012, the\ncourt heard argument concerning various motions, including JMR’s attorney fee motion.\n\n\n\nconnection with the lease of a commercial building. The lessees, without the lessors’\nknowledge, replaced the premises’ leaky roof, and later sought reimbursement from the\nlessors because the lease had imposed upon the lessors the obligation to repair and\nreplace the roof and all exterior walls. (Id. at pp. 608-610.) The appellate court\nconcluded that “notice as a condition precedent to the lessors’ obligation to repair is not\nonly clearly apparent from the terms of the written lease, it is indispensable to effectuate\nthe intentions of the parties. [Citation.] It has been held that unless explicitly excluded\ntherein, performance under an express covenant to repair is conditional upon notice from\nthe tenant. [Citations.] Accordingly, we hold that notice is an indispensable condition\nprecedent to [the lessors’] duty to perform under the covenant to repair” (Id. at p. 612.)\nHere, we address surety bonds and a surety-obligee relationship, not a commercial lease\nand a landlord-tenant relationship. Thus, the facts of Wal-Noon are distinguishable. This\ncase, unlike Wal-Noon, requires application of suretyship principles (e.g., Civil Code\nsections 2806 and 2807). Those principles, along with the absence of a clear indication\nthat the parties intended otherwise, compel our conclusion that notice of default to\nSureTec was not an implied condition precedent to recovery under the bonds.\n\n                                            51\n\fThe court’s tentative decision regarding that motion, in which it cited Johnson v. Siegel\n(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1087, was twofold: (1) JMR, because it did not seek mediation of\nits claims before filing suit, was not entitled to attorney fees for pursuing its complaint;\nbut (2) JMR was entitled to attorney fees for its defense of EAR’s cross-complaint.\n       In its written order of November 13, 2012, the court, among other things, ordered\nJMR to calculate the amount of attorney fees incurred before the filing of EAR’s cross-\ncomplaint. The court also set a deadline for that submission and for a response by\ndefendants. The court further indicated in its order that it would “issue an award of\nAttorney Fees to JMR, consistent with its tentative ruling on November 2, 2012.”13 The\nrecord does not include an order fixing an amount of fees entered subsequent to the\ncourt’s November 13, 2012 order. EAR has indicated in its opening brief that it\nexpressly reserves the right to appeal any such order fixing the amount of attorney fees.\nAnd the parties at oral argument on November 19, 2015, indicated that, as of that date,\nthe court had not yet issued an order fixing the amount of attorney fees awardable to\nJMR.\n       A postjudgment award of attorney fees is generally appealable pursuant to section\n904.1, subdivision (a)(1). (Whiteside v. Tenet Healthcare Corp. (2002)\n101 Cal.App.4th 693, 706.) But “if a judgment determines that a party is entitled to\nattorney’s fees but does not determine the amount, that portion of the judgment is\nnonfinal and nonappealable.” (P R Burke Corp. v. Victor Valley Wastewater\nReclamation Authority (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1053 (P R Burke).) This conclusion\nis based upon the principle that an order that contemplates further action by the court is\nnot final. (See Koshak v. Malek (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1540, 1545; Steen v. Fremont\nCemetery Corp. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1221, 1228-1229.)\n\n       13\n        The record does not contain a tentative ruling dated November 2, 2012. We\nassume the trial court was referring to its tentative ruling made at the hearing on\nNovember 9, 2012.\n                                              52\n\f       Here, the November 13, 2012 postjudgment order was nonfinal because it did not\nfix an amount of attorney fees awardable to JMR. Rather, it simply adopted the court’s\ntentative ruling denying attorney fees to JMR for its prosecution of the complaint and\ngranting fees for its defense of the cross-complaint. The court specifically contemplated\na future order awarding JMR a fixed amount of attorney fees after the parties submitted\nfurther pleadings. Thus, the order “was nonfinal [because f]urther judicial action was\nnecessary to determine the extent of [JMR’s] entitlement to attorney’s fees.” (P R Burke,\nsupra, 98 Cal.App.4th at p. 1054, italics original.) It was a “ ‘postjudgment’ order[]\n[that] lacked finality in that [it was] also preparatory to later proceedings,” a type of order\nwhich the California Supreme Court has held is generally not appealable. (Lakin v.\nWatkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 653.) But this conclusion does not\nend our inquiry.\n       SureTec argues somewhat conclusorily that “the trial court’s order that JMR is\nentitled to attorney[] fees is the necessary predicate for its final [] appealable order, also\nentered [] November 13, 2012, that JMR is entitled to $90,644.07 in expert witness fees.”\nWhile we agree with SureTec’s implicit statement that the court utilized its attorney fee\norder in concluding that JMR was entitled to expert witness fees, we disagree with\nSureTec’s ultimate conclusion that we are required to review the court’s interim nonfinal\nattorney fee order here.\n       Under section 906, where an appeal under section 904.1 is taken, “the reviewing\ncourt may review the verdict or decision and any intermediate ruling, proceeding, order\nor decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order\nappealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party.” (See Abramson v.\nJuniper Networks, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 638, 649.) The intermediate order of\nNovember 13, 2012, finding defendants liable to JMR for attorney fees is related to the\ncourt’s order of the same date awarding JMR’s expert witness fees under section 998. As\nwe discuss in section IV, post, the court’s award of expert fees to JMR pursuant to\n                                              53\n\fsection 998 was founded on the assumption that, after aggregating JMR’s monetary\nrecovery under the judgment with its attorney fee award, JMR will recover more than its\npretrial $375,000 offer to compromise. But, as we also discuss, since the court has not\nyet issued a monetary award of fees, its determination that JMR’s total recovery has\nexceeded $375,000 is erroneous. Thus, the court’s November 13, 2012 interim order\ndetermining that JMR is entitled to recover attorney fees in defending EAR’s cross-\ncomplaint is not relevant to our consideration of the appealable order awarding expert\nwitness fees. We therefore decline to consider the nonappealable interim attorney fee\norder at this time.\n       IV.    Award of Expert Fees Pursuant to Section 998\n       After entry of judgment, JMR submitted a memorandum of costs in which it\nclaimed, among other costs, expert witness fees in the total amount of $90,644.07.\nConcurrently with its costs memorandum, JMR filed a brief in which it argued it was\nentitled to recover expert witness fees pursuant to section 998. It asserted that more than\n10 days before trial, in accordance with section 998, it had served identical offers to EAR\nand SureTec in which it offered to have judgment taken against the respective defendants\nin the amount of $375,000 with each side to bear its own costs. JMR argued that because\nit had obtained a judgment that—after adding statutory prevailing-party costs and\nattorney fees to the monetary award of $315,631—exceeded the $375,000 amount of the\noffers, the court in its discretion could award it reasonable postoffer expert witness costs.\nSureTec and EAR filed separate motions to strike/tax costs that included opposition to an\naward to JMR of its expert witness fees.14\n\n\n\n\n       14\n         The motion to tax or strike costs filed by EAR is not included in the appellate\nrecord, but it is referenced in numerous documents included in the record. And EAR’s\nreply memorandum in support of its motion to tax or strike costs, which includes\nargument in opposition to JMR’s request for expert witness fees, is part of the record.\n                                             54\n\f       On November 9, 2012, the court heard argument on defendants’ motions to\nstrike/tax costs. The court then issued an order on November 13, 2012, denying\ndefendants’ parallel motions, thereby awarding JMR expert witness fees of $90,644.07.\nAn order fixing costs and disposing of a motion to tax costs is a separately appealable\norder under section 904.1, subdivision (b). (Grant v. List & Lathrop (1992)\n2 Cal.App.4th 993, 996.)\n       On appeal, EAR and SureTec make identical arguments that the court erred in\nawarding JMR postoffer expert witness costs. They contend the award was improper\nbecause JMR received a judgment of $315,631, nearly $60,000 less than its section 998\noffers. Further, they assert that JMR may only reach the threshold amount of more than\n$375,000 if it is awarded attorney fees exceeding $59,369; defendants both contend that\nno attorney fees should be awarded to JMR. Lastly, defendants posit that an award of\nexpert fees is premature because the court has yet to determine a fixed amount of attorney\nfees awardable to JMR for purposes of determining whether it has obtained a judgment\nmore favorable than the offers pursuant to section 998. We agree with defendants’ third\nargument and will reverse on that basis.\n       Section 998, subdivision (a) provides that “costs allowed under section 1031 and\n1032 shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section.” The statute sets forth a\nprocedure by which a party, not less than 10 days before trial (or arbitration), may serve a\nwritten offer to settle the litigation, including a specification of “the terms and conditions\nof the judgment or award.” (§ 998, subd. (b).) Under subdivision (d), “[i]f an offer made\nby a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable\njudgment . . . the court . . . in its discretion, may require the defendant to pay a reasonable\nsum to cover postoffer costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular\nemployees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both,\npreparation for trial . . . or during trial . . . of the case by the plaintiff, in addition to\nplaintiff’s costs.” Under a parallel provision, a defendant who makes a pretrial offer that\n                                                 55\n\fis not accepted, upon the plaintiff’s failure to obtain a more favorable judgment, may\nrecover, in the court’s discretion, reasonable expert costs incurred by the defendant in\npreparation for trial and trial. (§ 998, subd. (c)(1).) The statute’s purpose “is to\nencourage the settlement of lawsuits prior to trial.” (T. M. Cobb Co. v. Superior Court\n(1984) 36 Cal.3d 273, 280.)\n       In determining under section (d) if a defendant has failed to obtain a judgment\nmore favorable than a plaintiff’s section 998 offer, where the offer contains a waiver of\ncosts, “ ‘the amount of the judgment is deemed to be the amount of the damages plus the\namount of costs allowed under section 1033.5, subdivision (a).’ [Citation.]” (Wilson v.\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 382, 392.) Included among the costs\npermitted under section 1033.5, subdivision (a) are attorney fees that are authorized by\ncontract. (§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).)\n       In this case, there has, to date, been no award of a defined amount of attorney fees\nin favor of JMR. Pursuant to the court’s November 13, 2012 order, it granted EAR’s\nmotion to strike certain costs listed in JMR’s costs memorandum. As a result, the total\namount of costs awarded pursuant to JMR’s costs memorandum (excluding expert\nwitness fees) was $4,800.18. Adding these costs to the judgment, the total judgment to\ndate is $320,431.18, nearly $55,000 less than the pretrial offers. It is apparent that the\ncourt—given the sizable amount of attorney fees claimed by JMR in its motion for fees\nunder Civil Code section 1717 ($252,889)—assumed JMR would ultimately receive an\nattorney fee award that would bring JMR’s total recovery above the pretrial offer\nthreshold of $375,000. But, as we have discussed (see section III, ante), the November\n13, 2012 order regarding attorney fees is an interim, nonappealable order that\ncontemplates further action (i.e., determining the amount of the award) by the court.\nAccordingly, any finding that JMR is entitled, in the court’s discretion, to an award of\nexpert fees pursuant to section 998, subdivision (d) is premature. We will therefore\nreverse the court’s order of November 13, 2012, awarding JMR expert fees pursuant to\n                                              56\n\fsection 998 and will remand the case to the trial court. Such reversal is without prejudice\nto the court, upon rendering an attorney fee award, to make a discretionary determination\nas to whether JMR is entitled to an award of postoffer expert witness fees under section\n998.\n       V.     EAR’s Motion for New Trial\n       As its final claim of error, EAR contends the court abused its discretion in denying\nits motion for new trial. It argues the court’s alleged failure to read JMR’s proposed\nstatement of decision before signing it constituted “an ‘irregularity in the proceedings’ ”\nthat compelled the granting of the new trial motion. This contention is without merit.\n       After entry of judgment, EAR filed a motion for new trial, asserting six of the\nseven statutory grounds provided under section 657, including “irregularity in the\nproceedings of the court” as provided in subdivision (1) of the statute. The bulk of\nEAR’s argument below was that (1) JMR concealed and suppressed evidence, thereby\ndenying EAR a fair trial, and (2) there was insufficient evidence supporting the finding of\nEAR’s responsibility for delay and for the award of damages (including Eichleay\ndamages and damages related to supplying the air compressor). Although EAR made\nreference to the statement of decision in its motion—challenging both its timeliness and\nits contents—it did not include as a basis for granting new trial the allegation that the\nstatement of decision had been signed by the court without reading it. By failing to raise\nthe issue below in its motion for new trial, EAR forfeited its appellate challenge to the\ndenial of the motion on this basis. (North Coast Business Park v. Nielsen Construction\nCo. (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 22, 28 [failure to preserve issue below result in forfeiture of\nappellate claim].)\n       Moreover, even if we were to address EAR’s argument on the merits, it would fail.\nEAR twice states in its opening brief that the trial court “failed to read” the proposed\nstatement of decision before signing it. It presents no evidence in support of this bald\nassertion. (See § 658 [new trial motion based upon irregularity of the proceedings “must\n                                             57\n\fbe made upon affidavits”]; Linhart v. Nelson (1976) 18 Cal.3d 641, 644 [court may not\nconsider ground for new trial motion where affidavit supporting that ground is required\nunder section 658 and none is submitted].) There is thus no basis for EAR’s contention\nthat the court abused its discretion in denying the motion for new trial. (See Plancarte v.\nGuardsmark, LLC (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 640, 645 [“trial court’s broad discretion in\nruling on a motion for new trial is accorded great deference on appeal”].)\n       VI.    Remaining Arguments by SureTec\n       SureTec asserts three further arguments. Its first two arguments are that (1) if the\njudgment is reversed as to SureTec, it is entitled to its attorney fees for its successful\ndefense of the lawsuit, including the attorney fees incurred on appeal; and (2) if the\njudgment against EAR is reversed, the judgment against SureTec must likewise be\nreversed. Since we affirm the judgment, neither of these arguments has merit.\n       As its third remaining argument, SureTec argues that, assuming the judgment is\nnot reversed, its maximum liability for damages, including costs and attorney fees, is\n$471,881, the amount of the performance bond issued on EAR’s plumbing subcontract.\nIt contends that because the court, despite SureTec’s request, did not allocate the damage\naward as between the two subcontracts, there can be no inference drawn that some\namount of the $315,631 damages was awarded for EAR’s breach of the electrical\nsubcontract. Accordingly, SureTec argues, its responsibility to answer for its principal,\nEAR, is limited to the $471,881 amount of the performance bond for the plumbing\nsubcontract. It seeks an order from this court to this effect.\n       As discussed in section IV, ante, the total amount of JMR’s recovery to date,\nincluding costs properly awarded by the court, is $320,431.18. This is approximately\n$150,000 less than the amount of the performance bond for the plumbing subcontract.\nThe trial court has not yet made a final ruling regarding attorney fees, and any issue\nconcerning JMR’s claimed entitlement to expert fees under section 998 will be decided\nby the trial court in its discretion upon remand. Thus, at this point there is no justiciable\n                                              58\n\fissue for resolution by this court, and we decline to decide hypothetical or theoretical\ncontroversies. (See In re Joshua S. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 261, 273 [courts do not “ ‘issu[e]\npurely advisory opinions, or consider[] a hypothetical state of facts in order to give\ngeneral guidance rather than to resolve a specific legal dispute’ ”]; see also Hunt v.\nSuperior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 984, 998.)\n                                   DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed. The postjudgment order of November 13, 2012,\nawarding expert witness fees to JMR pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998 is\nreversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion. Statutory costs are awarded to respondent JMR.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  Márquez, J.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n    Rushing, P.J.\n\n\n\n\n    Elia, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                             59\n\fTrial Court:                                Monterey County Superior Court Superior\n                                            Court No.: M105497\n\n\nTrial Judge:                                The Honorable\n                                            Lydia M.

The owner, the United States\nArmy Corps of Engineers (the Corps), retained JMR Construction Corp. (JMR) as\ngeneral contractor for the Project. JMR, in turn, entered into various subcontracts,\nincluding separate electrical and plumbing subcontracts, with Environmental Assessment\nand Remediation Management, Inc. (EAR). SureTec Insurance Company (SureTec)\nissued separate bonds guaranteeing EAR’s performance under the two subcontracts.\n        While the Project was ongoing, JMR (1) communicated with EAR about alleged\ndelays, deficient and late submittals, and improper plumbing work, and (2) retained\n\n        *\n         Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 8.1105(b) and 8.1110, this opinion is\ncertified for publication with the exception of parts I.A., I.C., III, IV, V, and VI of the\nDiscussion.\n\fcertain funds otherwise due to EAR under the subcontracts. After the Project was\ncompleted, JMR filed suit against EAR and SureTec (collectively, defendants) for breach\nof contract and for foreclosure of the performance bonds. JMR alleged it was damaged\nas a result of EAR’s failure to perform under the two subcontracts. EAR filed a cross-\ncomplaint for recovery of retention funds withheld under the subcontracts.\n       After a court trial, JMR was awarded the net amount of $315,631, which included\nan offset for the retention funds JMR withheld under the subcontracts. In posttrial\nproceedings, the court issued an order determining JMR was entitled to recover attorney\nfees in an amount to be determined for its successful defense of the cross-complaint. The\ncourt also awarded JMR $90,644.07 in expert witness fees pursuant to Code of Civil\nProcedure section 9981 by concluding that JMR’s total monetary recovery ($315,631 plus\nan undetermined amount of attorney fees) had exceeded the $375,000 amount of its\npretrial settlement offers. SureTec and EAR filed separate appeals.\n       EAR makes seven arguments on appeal. First, it asserts there was no substantial\nevidence to support the trial court’s finding it was liable to JMR for delays on the Project.\nSecond, it argues the court erred by using the Eichleay method of calculating extended\nhome office overhead damages. Third, it asserts the court erred by utilizing the modified\ntotal cost method of calculating disruption and delay damages. Fourth, it argues the\ncourt, in its statement of decision, failed to address essential matters of fact and law.\nFifth, it contends the court erred in determining JMR was entitled to attorney fees in\ndefending the cross-complaint. Sixth, it asserts JMR was not entitled to recover its expert\nwitness fees pursuant to section 998. And seventh, it contends the court erred by denying\nits motion for new trial.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise\nspecified.\n                                              2\n\f       SureTec contends JMR cannot prevail against SureTec because JMR failed to\ndeclare EAR in default under the subcontracts, and JMR failed to notify SureTec of any\nsuch default. It also contends the order finding JMR entitled to attorney fees on EAR’s\ncross-complaint was improper as to SureTec. Further, it contests the award to JMR of\nexpert witness fees under section 998. And it argues that SureTec’s liability must be\nlimited to a maximum of $471,881, the ceiling of its liability under the performance bond\non the plumbing subcontract.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude the court did not err in its\nutilization of the Eichleay method to calculate extended home office overhead damages\nand in its use of the modified total cost method of calculating JMR’s disruption and delay\ndamages. We also hold the court did not err in finding SureTec liable under the\nperformance bonds, concluding that formal notice of EAR’s default was not a condition\nprecedent to JMR’s recovery under the bonds. In the unpublished portion of this opinion,\nwe conclude (1) there was substantial evidence supporting the court’s finding that EAR\nwas liable to JMR for Project delays; (2) the court’s statement of decision was not\ndefective; (3) defendants’ challenges to the interim, nonfinal, postjudgment order\ndetermining that JMR was entitled to recover attorney fees in defending the cross-\ncomplaint are not cognizable at this time; (4) defendants’ challenges to the award of\nJMR’s expert witness fees under section 998 are meritorious; (5) EAR’s claim that the\ncourt abused its discretion in denying EAR’s motion for new trial has no merit; and\n(6) SureTec’s request for an order that its maximum liability is $471,881 is not\ncognizable because it is a request for an advisory opinion. Accordingly we will affirm\nthe judgment, reverse the order awarding expert witness fees, and remand the case for\nfurther postjudgment proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                            PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       On April 29, 2010, JMR filed its complaint against EAR and SureTec. JMR\nalleged four causes of action: (1) breach of the plumbing subcontract; (2) enforcement\n                                             3\n\fand foreclosure on the performance bond for the plumbing subcontract; (3) breach of the\nelectrical subcontract; and (4) enforcement and foreclosure on the performance bond for\nthe electrical subcontract. The first and third causes of action were alleged against EAR,\nwhile the second and fourth causes of action were alleged against SureTec.2 JMR alleged\nthat EAR’s failure or refusal to perform its work under the two subcontracts in\naccordance with the Project’s schedule “caused project delay, acceleration, and related\ndamages to JMR.” The alleged damages included “offset of JMR claims against the\nOwner, increased cost of JMR on-site performance costs and other loss of cost recovery\nand overhead on the Project.” In each of the four causes of action, JMR claimed its\ndamages were in an amount “not less than $200,000.00.”\n       EAR filed a cross-complaint against JMR alleging breach of contract and common\ncounts. It alleged in separate causes of action that JMR had breached the electrical\nsubcontract and plumbing subcontract, and that as a result of these breaches, EAR had\nbeen damaged in an amount in excess of $108,913.31.\n       A five-day court trial took place in January 2012. After the parties submitted\nposttrial briefs in lieu of final argument, the court issued a ruling on April 30, 2012,\nfinding in favor of JMR in the total amount of $379,318, which amount included a\ndeduction of $121,893 that had been previously withheld from EAR under the\nsubcontracts. The court further ordered that EAR take nothing on its cross-complaint.\n       Pursuant to the court’s request, JMR submitted a proposed statement of decision in\nwhich it withdrew one of its claims and adjusted the amount of another claim, resulting in\nrevised damages award of $315,631. The damages were derived by (1) adding five\ndamage figures in amounts of $29,249 (air compressor), $132,168 (field overhead for\ndelay), $15,440 (field overhead for Project closeout), $14,244 (markup for field\n\n       2\n         JMR also sought in the second and fourth causes of action to foreclose on the\npayment bonds issued by SureTec under the two subcontracts. The payment bonds are\nnot at issue in this appeal.\n                                              4\n\foverhead), $60,693 (Eichleay home office overhead), and $185,730 (damages during\nframing and drywall phase); and (2) subtracting from this amount $121,893 previously\nwithheld under the subcontracts. On July 19, 2012, the court signed the statement of\ndecision. On August 14, 2012, the court entered judgment in favor of JMR and against\ndefendants in the amount of $315,631. The court also ordered that EAR and SureTec\ntake nothing on the cross-complaint3 and that defendants were liable for JMR’s costs,\nincluding attorney fees in defending the cross-complaint, in an amount to be determined\nafter appropriate filings by JMR.\n       In postjudgment proceedings (discussed in greater detail, post), the court issued an\norder on November 13, 2012, granting JMR’s request for recovery of expert fees of\n$90,644.07. In the same order, the court reaffirmed a prior tentative ruling that it would\naward attorney fees to JMR for its successful defense of EAR’s cross-complaint in an\namount to be determined at a later time.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       I.     EAR’s Appeal of the Judgment\n       EAR asserts four challenges to the court’s judgment. First, it contends there is no\nsubstantial evidence to support the court’s finding that EAR breached its subcontracts\nwith JMR. Second, it argues the court erred in using the Eichleay formula of calculating\nhome office overhead damages. Third, it claims the court erred in applying the modified\ntotal cost method of damages in connection with alleged delay damages associated with\nthe interior installation of metal studs and drywall (hereafter, the framing and drywall\nphase). And fourth, it argues the court’s statement of decision was defective in that it\nfailed to take into consideration essential matters of fact and law. We address each of\nthese contentions below.\n\n\n       3\n         The finding that SureTec take nothing on the cross-complaint appears to be in\nerror, since EAR was the sole cross-complainant.\n                                             5\n\f              A.     Sufficiency-of-Evidence Challenge\n                     1.     JMR Evidence\n                            a.     Testimony\n       On July 25, 2006, the Corps notified JMR that it had been awarded the contract to\ncomplete the Project at a total contract price of $6,691,000 (the prime contract).\nThereafter, on September 19, 2006, JMR and EAR executed the subcontract for electrical\nwork for a total contract price of $732,500. On November 14, 2006, JMR and EAR\nexecuted the subcontract for plumbing work for a total contract price of $471,881. Both\nsubcontracts recited that the schedule for performance of the prime contract was 450 days\nfrom the “Owner’s Notice to Proceed Date [of] 8/30/06,” thereby making the completion\ndate November 23, 2007. EAR acknowledged these “contract durations and time\nconstraints and [agreed it would] comply with [JMR’s] construction schedule.”\n       Work on the Project continued nearly six months passed the scheduled completion\ndate of November 23, 2007. The beneficial occupancy date—i.e., completion of the\nProject—was May 14, 2008.\n       Several representatives of JMR and one JMR-retained expert testified that EAR\nwas responsible for concurrent delays on the Project. Ron Rivard, JMR’s Vice President,\ntestified that the Project was delayed and the Corps, through change orders, granted a\n180-day extension of the Project completion date. The Corps was responsible in part for\nthe extension due to delays in approval of the landscaping plans. Rivard also testified\nthat three subcontractors—EAR, Countywide Mechanical (Countywide), and Del Monte\nGlass (Glass)—contributed to delays, but he did not know the number of delay days\ncaused by each of the three subcontractors, saying “[t]hat’s up [to] the experts.”\n       Rivard testified that one aspect of EAR-caused delay involved the furnishing of an\nair compressor. EAR initially disputed that an air compressor was included in its scope\nof work under the plumbing subcontract, but it eventually supplied an air compressor\nwithout producing a submittal beforehand. Submittals were required on the Project so the\n                                             6\n\fCorps could give advance approval of the equipment. The air compressor was not\napproved by the Corps, and EAR refused to provide a Corps-approved replacement\ncompressor. JMR thereafter procured and installed a Corps-approved compressor.\nRivard testified that EAR’s failure to supply an approved air compressor caused delay in\nJMR’s performance under the prime contract. He testified the schedule called for the air\ncompressor to be supplied in October 2007. Instead, it was supplied in February or\nMarch 2008.\n       Steven Hupaylo, JMR’s job superintendent for the Project from its inception to\nAugust 2007, was responsible for managing and coordinating the subcontractors in the\nfield. Hupaylo testified the drywall work for the interior of the clinic did not go well.\nJMR’s plan was to install metal framing, have EAR do its plumbing and electrical work\nin the uncovered metal frame, and then cover the metal frame along with the plumbing\nand electrical work with drywall. JMR had separated the building into three areas, with\nthe intention of going room-by-room to have this work done efficiently. According to\nHupaylo: “We had a good shot at doing the thing. And the biggest problem we had was .\n. . the plumbing and electrical that held us up in the [P]roject [by] not having materials,\nnot having skilled people, [and] not having any people sometimes. That was the single\nbiggest issue.” Hupaylo also testified that EAR’s plumbing crew “left the site a lot” and\nwere often working at other locations on the base. EAR’s foreman would sometimes\nshow up on the site without materials; he would promise to return to the site the next day,\nbut would not. As a result of ongoing problems with EAR’s performance under both\nsubcontracts, JMR had to install the drywall in a piecemeal fashion.\n       Daniel Spade worked as JMR’s project manager from January 2007 until the\nProject’s completion. Spade testified there were significant punch list items at the end of\nthe Project resulting from EAR’s deficient performance under the subcontracts. In\naddition, aside from the air compressor issue, there were problems with (1) an undersized\n\n\n                                              7\n\fwater heater, (2) the mixing valves controlling hot and cold water, and (3) the improper\noperation of the fire alarm and life safety system.\n       JMR also presented testimony from John Elmer, a construction management\nexpert with expertise in scheduling. JMR retained Elmer to review the schedule for the\nProject, to identify whether there were any delays in the Project’s completion, and to\ndetermine the causes of any delays. Elmer testified regarding concurrent delays on the\nProject. Defendants did not challenge Elmer’s qualifications as an expert.\n       Elmer testified that for any construction project, the owner and the general\ncontractor agree to an initial construction schedule—a baseline schedule. The general\ncontractor prepares a baseline schedule after receiving input from the subcontractors.\nThe general contractor then submits the baseline schedule to the owner for approval. The\nbaseline schedule is regularly tracked as work proceeds, typically through a computerized\nprogram. If there is a delay in the delivered date of any work, and the delay is on the\ncritical path—i.e., the longest path of activities required to complete the project—that\ndelay will extend the completion date of the Project.\n       In arriving at his opinions as to any delays to the baseline schedule, Elmer\nreviewed a number of construction documents, including monthly schedule updates, daily\nquality control reports, daily subcontractor reports, submittal logs, punch lists, and\ncorrespondence. In his analysis of the critical path of the Project, Elmer also created an\nas-built schedule from December 2007 to May 2008 to attempt to identify accurately the\nprogress of the work on the Project as compared with the baseline schedule. He created\nthis as-built schedule because the monthly schedule updates in the latter months of the\nProject did not accurately reflect the status of work being performed.\n       Elmer opined there was a critical path delay that extended the Project’s completion\nby 180 days. That delay was reflected in change orders from the Corps extending the\ncompletion date of the Project. Elmer testified that the parties responsible for the delays\nwere the Corps and three subcontractors: EAR, Countywide, and Glass. He opined that\n                                              8\n\fEAR and Countywide were concurrently responsible for 142 of the 180 days of delay,\nand that of those 142 days, Glass was concurrently responsible for 28 days of delay.\n       Elmer also testified that from December 19, 2007, to May 14, 2008 (the beneficial\noccupancy date), the commissioning of the life safety systems (operable heating\nventilating and air conditioning, smoke detector, and fire alarm systems) drove the\ncritical path. “Commissioning” involved these systems being “signed off as being\ncomplete and operable” and was a precondition for the owner accepting beneficial\noccupancy. Elmer testified that EAR, Countywide and, to a much lesser extent, Glass\nwere the subcontractors performing work relevant to the completion of these systems. He\nalso said the concurrent delays by Countywide did not delay EAR’s work on the life\nsafety systems, and he opined that JMR did not contribute to any delay in the completion\nof the Project between December 2007 and May 14, 2008.\n                             b.     Documentary Evidence\n       JMR introduced documentary evidence showing EAR was responsible for Project\ndelays. Most of the written communications were from Daniel Spade, JMR’s project\nmanager. Spade addressed some of the communications directly to John Fieri, EAR’s\nplumbing project manager. Most of the written communications not addressed to Fieri\nlisted Fieri as a “cc” recipient. As noted twice by the trial court in its statement of\ndecision, Fieri was not called by EAR as a witness at trial.\n       On July 11, 2007, Spade advised EAR in an email to Ravindra Pendurthi, EAR’s\nowner, that EAR had, in contravention of the specifications, used laborers instead of\nplumbers to install pipe. Spade also noted that “an entire wage review of [EAR] on the\n[P]roject [was] likely,” and he directed that Pendurthi “get [his] company in compliance.”\n       On August 10, 2007, Spade wrote a letter to Pendurthi indicating that (1) EAR was\n“well behind schedule on the interior walls in the building”; (2) pipe insulation had “not\nbeen completed[,] preventing completion of the drywall in many areas”; (3) “[t]he gas\nlines ha[d] not been run and therefore drywall in some areas will have to be removed and\n                                              9\n\freplaced at EAR’s expense”; (4) EAR had not delivered soffit light fixtures on-site,\n“preventing covering these areas”; (5) “lobby wall sconces [we]re not on site[,]\npreventing completion of rough-in”; and (6) EAR was responsible for deficient\nsubmittals (about which JMR had previously notified EAR), and EAR’s failure to correct\nthe deficient submittals had resulted in the Corps withholding funds due to JMR. Spade\nalso summarized that “EAR[’s] plumbing performance [was] substantially behind and\n[was] severely impacting the schedule and the timely completion of the [P]roject.” Spade\nadvised EAR that it had “48 hours to properly man the [P]roject with qualified\nplumbers.”\n       Spade sent EAR two follow-up emails in September 2007. In those emails, he\nstated the Corps was “not approving anymore [sic] money for plumbing and electrical\nwork done last month because submittal items ha[d] not been completed.” Spade also\nreiterated that the Corps was “holding money from last month[’]s billing.”\n       On October 28, 2007, Spade sent an email to EAR that listed incomplete plumbing\nand electrical items, stating “[s]ome of these items are having impacts and almost all are\noverdue.” On November 21, 2007, Spade sent another email to Pendurthi, indicating\nthere were “[m]ajor issues still outstanding,” and stating: “We have run out of time\nwaiting for your electrical submittals to be turned in . . . . This is a serious problem in that\nit could impact closeout of the [P]roject. If this occurs[,] EAR will be held responsible for\nJMR’s overhead costs and any associated damages.”\n       On December 7, 2007, Spade sent another email to Pendurthi about EAR’s delays\nand problems with Project submittals. Earlier that day, the Corps had advised JMR that\nthe Corps had in the past retained a portion of contract payments based upon “excessive\noutstanding submittals; progression of work without proper quality controls; and slippage\nof the approved [P]roject schedule.” The Corps also noted that “many of these\ndeficiencies ha[d] not yet been resolved.” Spade advised Pendurthi that “EAR ha[d] been\nresponsible for a significant amount of the production delay and 5 pages out of the 11\n                                              10\n\fpages of outstanding submittals.” He also noted that “almost all” of the electrical\nsubmittals and some of the plumbing submittals were still outstanding.\n          On January 14, 2008, Spade advised EAR by email that the Corps had not granted\nbeneficial occupancy of the building because there were outstanding issues concerning\nthe mechanical system. Spade said “[t]he majority of the [outstanding] items are EAR’s\nresponsibility.” He indicated the items needed to “be resolved this week.” And he said:\n“You have already been informed of the financial impact involved. The fact that these\nitems are weeks old and still not resolved are major issues to the [C]orps[’] home office.”\n          On January 21, 2008, Spade sent a letter to Fieri stating “[t]here [were] a number\nof major items that ha[d] been on the Quality Control punchlist for over a month,” and\nthe Corps was citing to the major items as a reason for denying beneficial occupancy.\nSpade sent another email to Fieri on February 29, 2008, advising there were “still a\nnumber of [punch list] items to resolve. Some on the plumbing side[,] others on the\nelectrical . . . . There are still a large number of electrical submittals[,] which is a huge\nissue.”\n          On March 19, 2008, Spade sent another email to Fieri noting there were still a\nnumber of punch list items to be addressed. Spade indicated: “The simple fact is EAR is\nworking on other projects and is not completing this work. [¶] No one is on[-]site\naddressing these items. Every time Bob [Clark of the Corps] visits[,] he finds something\nnew.” Spade also wrote: “We have been struggling with EAR’s installation of the\nplumbing system; clean outs have not been installed, goose neck vents not installed,\nplumbing venting not installed per plan and requiring shop drawings prior to installation,\nmedical gas pipe not brazed per specification (still a sore point with the Corps), DDC\nvalve not installed per civil plan . . ., and payroll issues. [¶] The biggest issue on the\nelectrical side has been the submittals, which are still not complete and over 1 year late.”\n\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f                     2.     EAR’s Evidence\n       Ravindra Pendurthi, EAR’s owner, testified that EAR started plumbing work on\nthe Project in late September or early October 2006, even though the subcontract was not\nformally executed until December 2006. He said EAR commenced electrical work on the\nProject in or about September 2006, before that subcontract was executed. He testified\nthat EAR started work early at JMR’s urging, because JMR was “behind schedule” on the\nProject.\n       According to Pendurthi, JMR was slow in providing EAR with a baseline schedule\nfor the Project. He said JMR did not provide it until March 2007. He acknowledged that\nat the time, EAR responded in writing that the schedule was fine, but that its compliance\nwith it was dependent on timely work by other tradesmen whose work needed to be\ncompleted before EAR’s.\n       Pendurthi described several tasks that were added to its scope of work under both\nsubcontracts which extended EAR’s time to complete its performance. He also testified\nthat JMR approved change orders for this additional work, but JMR did not formally\ngrant EAR extensions of time. Instead, in each instance, the JMR representative (either\nSpade or Hupaylo) advised EAR that JMR was behind schedule but would “take care of\n[EAR’s extension request] at the end of the [P]roject.”\n       Pendurthi testified there was a period of time in which EAR inquired of JMR\nabout the equipment JMR was going to provide that impacted EAR’s rough-in plumbing\nwork. He said JMR’s delay in providing this information interfered with EAR’s ability to\ncomplete its work.\n       Pendurthi denied that EAR lacked sufficient materials or failed to supply sufficient\npersonnel to work on the Project. He also denied that EAR’s work crews on the Project\nwere pulled off the job to do other work. He claimed EAR had dedicated crews for the\nProject. He acknowledged that EAR’s foreman sometimes did not show up to work\n\n\n                                            12\n\fbecause he had a persistent gout problem. But, he said, EAR eventually addressed the\nissue by replacing the foreman.\n       Pendurthi testified that much of the drywall work—particularly the work in the x-\nray room and dentures room—was done out of sequence and was hampered because JMR\ndid not have proper submittals. He said this caused delays in EAR’s performance.\nPendurthi also testified that the drywall cost was elevated and its time of completion was\nlengthened because the Corps required a “level five finish,” which was a quality much\nmore difficult to achieve than a normal sheetrock job. In addition, JMR used an out-of-\ntown workforce that resulted in cost overruns. Pendurthi admitted on cross-examination\nthat EAR did not advise JMR in writing that JMR was causing delays in EAR’s\nperformance.\n       Pendurthi also testified there was a period of time in or about November 2006\nwhen JMR did not have on-site quality control personnel as required by the Corps. JMR\nasked for help from EAR, and EAR supplied quality control personnel to work on-site for\napproximately one month. Pendurthi testified that JMR’s failure to have on-site quality\ncontrol personnel for a period of time delayed EAR’s performance.\n       According to Pendurthi, all of EAR’s work under both subcontracts was accepted.\nPendurthi testified that by November 30, 2007—according to applications for payment\nEAR had submitted—EAR’s plumbing and electrical work were 98.66 percent and 96.36\npercent completed, respectively. Pendurthi testified that after December 1, 2007, EAR’s\nremaining work was “[m]ostly finish work” during which time EAR was waiting for\nother trades to complete their work.\n                     3.     Substantial Evidence Standard of Review\n       As a fundamental proposition, a judgment or order is presumed correct on appeal.\n(In re Marriage of Arceneaux (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612381\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612381/in-re-marriage-of-arceneaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1133.) “ ‘All intendments and\npresumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and\nerror must be affirmatively shown.’ ” (Denham v.

As one court has explained: “While it is\ncommonly stated that our ‘power’ begins and ends with a determination that there is\nsubstantial evidence [citation], this does not mean we must blindly seize any evidence in\nsupport of the respondent in order to affirm the judgment. The Court of Appeal ‘was not\ncreated . . . merely to echo the determinations of the trial court.

[Citation.] While substantial evidence may\nconsist of inferences, such inferences must be ‘a product of logic and reason’ and ‘must\nrest on the evidence’ [citation]; inferences that are the result of mere speculation or\nconjecture cannot support a finding [citations].” (Kuhn v.

Thus, an appellant’s\nrecitation of only the evidence supporting its position does not comply with the\nrequirements of an appellant’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, and may result in\nthe appellate court disregarding the claim. (Foreman & Clark Corp. v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34.)\n         EAR has not met its burden as appellant to provide a summary of the material\nevidence (including evidence favorable to respondent JMR) concerning the claims\nlitigated in the court trial. This failure is particularly pronounced in light of the wealth\n                                               16\n\fand complexity of the evidence adduced at trial. (See Boeken, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1658.) For instance, as seen from the recitation of facts, ante, there was a significant\namount of evidence presented by JMR—through the testimony of four employees or\nformer employees (Rivard, Hupaylo, Spade, and Thornton)—that EAR’s performance\nunder the two subcontracts hindered JMR’s ability to complete the prime contract and\nsignificantly delayed completion of the Project. Yet EAR, in its opening brief, does not\nmention that Hupaylo, Spade, or Thornton testified. EAR also fails to present Rivard’s\ntestimony that is unfavorable to EAR’s position, such as Rivard’s testimony that EAR’s\nfailure to install the air compressor caused significant delays to the Project. EAR’s\n“selective recitation of the record . . . is manifestly deficient,” and we may therefore treat\nits claim of error as waived. (In re Marriage of Fink, supra, 25 Cal.3d at p. 887.) But\neven if we were to consider EAR’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge as having not\nbeen waived, it nonetheless lacks merit.\n                     5.      Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Court’s Findings\n       JMR presented evidence from multiple sources that EAR’s breaches of the\nsubcontracts were a concurrent cause in the delay of the completion of the Project.\nSteven Hupaylo, JMR’s job superintendent, testified that JMR’s drywall work was\ndelayed by EAR’s performance. According to Hupaylo, JMR’s planned, methodical\napproach to building out the interior was “held . . . up . . . [by EAR’s] not having\nmaterials, not having skilled people, [and] not having any people sometimes. That was\nthe biggest single issue.” Because of the ongoing problems with EAR’s performance\nunder both subcontracts, JMR had to complete the drywall work in an inefficient,\npiecemeal fashion. Documentary evidence presented by JMR—including a number of\nwritten communications from Spade to EAR—confirmed that (1) EAR’s plumbing and\nelectrical work was behind schedule; (2) some of EAR’s plumbing work was done\ncontrary to specifications; (3) EAR had performed work without proper quality controls;\n(4) EAR had failed to timely deliver certain electrical products, thereby delaying the\n                                              17\n\fProject; (5) EAR was responsible for multiple deficient or late submittals that resulted in\nthe Corps withholding payment under the prime contract; and (6) EAR was responsible\nfor numerous punch list items as of January 2008 that, two months later, it had not yet\naddressed. Spade also confirmed in his testimony that EAR’s deficient performance\nunder both subcontracts had resulted in several significant punch list items at the end of\nthe Project. And Rivard testified that EAR’s failure to supply the air compressor delayed\nJMR’s performance under the prime contract. Furthermore, JMR’s retained construction\nmanagement expert, John Elmer, gave detailed testimony concerning EAR’s\nresponsibility for concurrent delays on the Project. Elmer opined that of the 180 days of\ncritical path delay, EAR was concurrently responsible for 142 days of delay. EAR\nneither challenged Elmer’s expert qualifications nor presented its own expert testimony\nto contradict Elmer’s opinions.\n       In urging there was no substantial evidence supporting the judgment, EAR\nemphasizes the testimony of its owner, Pendurthi. EAR argues that “Pendurthi provided\nclear, positive and rationally believable testimony that the Project delays . . . were caused\nin whole or in part by JMR itself.” It cites to Pendurthi’s testimony that delays related to\nthe drywall installation and to time and cost overruns were due to matters chargeable to\nJMR—i.e., the difficulty of achieving “level five” drywall finish and JMR’s choice of\nusing expensive, out-of-town labor. But as trier of fact, “[t]he trial court [was] the\nexclusive judge of the credibility of the witnesses.” (People v. Duncan (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2279625\"><a href=\"/opinion/2279625/people-v-duncan/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The court was therefore free to discount or\nreject Pendurthi’s testimony as self-serving, lacking in specifics, or otherwise lacking\ncredibility. (See In re Ana C. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1317</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1329 [appellate court cannot\nsubstitute its assessment of witnesses’ credibility for the trial court’s credibility\nassessment].) It is clear the trial court did not credit Pendurthi’s testimony, finding in the\nstatement of decision, for instance, that (1) “Pendurthi’s contrary conclusory explanations\n                                              18\n\f[regarding disruption and delay caused by EAR in the framing and drywall phase we]re\nnot credible”; (2) “Pendurthi’s conclusion that JMR’s alleged late finishing of the drywall\ndelayed EAR’s work [wa]s illogical”; and (3) EAR’s failure to produce documentary\nevidence “to support Mr. Pendurthi’s testimony renders [his] testimony weak and\nunreliable.”4 The court thus accepted the evidence presented by JMR—particularly\nHupaylo’s testimony—concerning delays caused by EAR in connection with the metal\nframing and drywall phases of the Project. Further, while EAR stresses Pendurthi’s\ntestimony that JMR’s failure to have on-site quality control personnel for a period of time\nin the fall of 2006 caused delay, the trial court could have minimized or rejected this\ntestimony as well. Indeed, there was no evidence that this delay early in the Project,\nassuming its existence, was a delay under a critical path analysis.\n       EAR also argues that JMR’s damages expert, Juan Perez, provided testimony\nnegating JMR’s claim that EAR was responsible for delaying the project: EAR argues\nthat Perez “testified that JMR was the cause of concurrent Project delays—upwards of\n75% responsibility during a time in August 2007—for failing to timely submit\noutstanding Project submittals.” (Original emphasis.) But the date cited by EAR is\nmisstated. The correct date is August 2008, three months after the Corps accepted the\nProject. Perez called the several-months period after beneficial occupancy (May 14,\n2008) the “Project Closeout” period. And to the extent EAR’s argument is that Perez’s\ndamage calculation testimony should be disregarded because he admitted that JMR had\n“upwards of 75% responsibility” for delays in the critical path timeline, JMR conflates\n\n\n       4\n         The court, in its statement of decision, specifically rejected other testimony\npresented by Pendurthi, including his assertion that there were precontract discussions in\nwhich the parties plainly agreed that supplying an air compressor was outside the scope\nof EAR’s duties under the plumbing subcontract. Pendurthi testified at length concerning\nthis issue. But because EAR does not challenge the trial court’s finding against EAR and\nits award of damages to JMR concerning the air compressor, we do not recite that\ntestimony here.\n                                             19\n\ftwo distinct parts of Perez’s testimony. As discussed, post, Perez opined that EAR was\nresponsible for at least 75 percent of the delay damages sustained by JMR during the\n142-day period in which EAR and another subcontractor, Countywide, were concurrently\nresponsible for delays in the critical path timeline. Based upon EAR’s responsibility for\ndelays during this 142-day period, Perez calculated damages in the form of field overhead\nand Eichleay damages. The “Project Closeout” was a period of 13 weeks after the 142-\nday concurrent delay period. Perez testified that during this period when the Project was\nwinding down, there were a number of outstanding contractor submittals. Perez, on a\nweek-by-week basis, determined the total number of submittals on the Project, the\nnumber of outstanding EAR submittals, and then multiplied EAR’s percentage of total\nsubmittals by the total weekly field overhead. During the third week of May 2008, for\nexample, the total field overhead was $6,641.73, EAR was responsible for 43 percent of\nthe outstanding submittals (36 of 84) during that week, so EAR’s proportional liability\nfor the week was $2,855.94. During two weeks of August 2008, there were four\noutstanding submittals—one was EAR’s and three were JMR’s. Perez therefore allocated\n25 percent of the weekly overhead to EAR for each these two weeks. The fact that Perez\ndetermined that JMR had 75 percent responsibility for delays during two weeks of\nAugust 2008—and calculated damages based upon EAR’s 25 percent responsibility\nduring that period—has nothing to do with Perez assessment of damages based upon\nEAR’s concurrent delay responsibility for the 142-day period preceding the Corps’s\nacceptance of beneficial occupancy of the Project on May 14, 2008.\n      In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence of causation for the\ndelay, EAR argues, in one sentence of its opening brief, that JMR “was unable to provide\nsubstantial evidence as to any Project delay damages allegedly attributable to EAR.” We\nneed not address this conclusory, undeveloped legal argument. (Tilbury Constructors,\nInc. v. State Compensation Ins. Fund (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255645\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255645/tilbury-constructors-v-compensation-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Challenges to the Calculation of Contract Damages\n       In the alternative to its sufficiency-of-the evidence challenge, EAR contests the\ncourt’s acceptance of the Eichleay formula of recovering home office overhead damages.\nEAR also contends the court erred in applying the modified total cost method of\ncalculating the cost associated with delays in the framing and drywall phase of the\nProject. We will address these two challenges after first identifying the appropriate\nstandards of review. At the outset, however, we will present a summary of the evidence\nconcerning JMR’s claims of damages.\n                     1.     Evidence Concerning Damages\n       JMR presented evidence of damages that involved four categories: (1) field\noverhead delay damages; (2) home office overhead (Eichleay delay damages); (3) delay\ndamages associated with the framing and drywall phase of the Project, utilizing the\nmodified total cost method; and (4) costs associated with EAR’s failure to supply an\napproved air compressor. We will not summarize the air compressor damages, since they\nare not at issue in this appeal. But given their interrelationship with the Eichleay delay\ndamages, we will review the evidence of field overhead damages even though those\ndamages are not directly challenged by EAR.\n                            a.     Field Overhead Damages\n       Daniel Spade, JMR’s project manager, testified that the Corps had rejected JMR’s\nrecovery of any extended overhead damages resulting from delays in the Project’s\ncompletion. The Corps rejected these damages because there were concurrent delays\ncaused by parties other than the Corps. At trial, JMR’s construction management expert,\nJohn Elmer, explained that when the owner of a public works project causes delay, and a\nsubcontractor or subcontractors concurrently cause delay, the owner may grant the\ngeneral contractor an extension of time to complete the project, but it will not grant the\n                                             21\n\fgeneral contractor compensable time (i.e., delay damages payable by the owner). Elmer\ntestified that under such circumstances, the general contractor will typically seek delay\ndamages from the subcontractor, under the theory that the general contractor “should\nhave recovered compensable time, but . . . was precluded from [doing so] because of [the\nsubcontractor’s] delay.”\n       Juan Perez, a construction expert retained by JMR, provided extensive testimony\nregarding JMR’s delay damages attributable to EAR. Defendants did not challenge\nPerez’s qualifications as an expert. Perez testified that he has had experience in\npresenting disruption claims on behalf of contractors. A disruption claim is based upon a\ncontractor’s intended performance or method of performance being impacted by another\ncontractor or by an event, resulting in the contractor’s performance being more costly\nbecause it is either done out of sequence or for an extended duration.\n       Perez calculated JMR’s damages based upon (1) his review of the project\ndocuments, and (2) his reliance upon the opinions of John Elmer, JMR’s construction\nmanagement expert. Specifically, Perez relied upon Elmer’s opinions that (1) there was a\ncritical path delay that extended the Project’s completion by 180 days; (2) 180 days is\nreflected in change orders issued by the Corps extending the Project’s completion date;\n(3) the parties responsible for the delays were the Corps and three subcontractors (EAR,\nCountywide Mechanical, and Del Monte Glass); (4) EAR and Countywide were each\nconcurrently responsible for 142 days of the 180 days of delay; (5) within the 142-day\nperiod, Del Monte Glass was concurrently responsible for 28 days of delay.\n       Perez opined that, under the two subcontracts combined, EAR was responsible for\nat least 75 percent of the delay damages sustained by JMR during the 142-day concurrent\ndelay period identified by Elmer. Perez arrived at this percentage allocation after\nconsidering (a) Elmer’s allocation of EAR’s responsibility for concurrent delays\n(63 percent); (b) a determination of EAR’s percentage of the total contract value of the\n\n\n                                            22\n\fmechanical, electrical, and plumbing trades (67 percent); and (c) the percentage of punch\nlist items for the 142-day concurrent delay period (83 percent).\n       Perez also rendered the opinion that JMR sustained field overhead damages\nassociated with EAR’s concurrent delay. Field overhead costs are the costs a contractor\nincurs in maintaining its field operations, including cost items such as storage trailers,\noffice trailers, and a job superintendent’s salary. Perez concluded that JMR’s total field\noverhead damages for which EAR was responsible was $161,851.33.\n                             b.     Home Office Overhead Damages\n       Perez testified that he calculated damages for JMR’s home office costs (otherwise\nknown as unabsorbed overhead costs) using the Eichleay formula. Perez explained that\nthis formula “is a method of allocating those home office overhead costs to a project that\n[has] been extended or delayed.” According to Perez, the Eichley formula is the\n“exclusive method approved by the Federal Government to arrive at the fair\ncompensation amount for unabsorbed overhead costs.” He testified that “[b]ut for the\nconcurrent delays on the project, the Eichleay [f]ormula would have been used by both\nJMR and the Government to arrive at the fair compensation amount for unabsorbed\noverhead costs that belonged to JMR.”\n                             c.     Framing and Drywall Phase Damages\n       JMR qualified its vice-president, Ron Rivard, as an expert witness in estimating\ninterior framing and drywall work. Rivard had over 30 years’ experience as a licensed\ngeneral contractor, and approximately 35 years as an estimator in which he had estimated\nat least 300 jobs.\n       Rivard testified that he prepared the bid for the framing and drywall phase of the\nProject. In doing so, he utilized the plans in an electronic format and used computer\nsoftware to perform a detailed cost takeoff. The takeoff yielded a bill of materials, and\nthe software automatically assigned a labor factor indicating the number of labor hours\nassociated with the particular area of work. The labor factor was based upon historical\n                                             23\n\fdata, i.e., JMR’s experience in constructing buildings similar to the building in the\nProject. The total bid for the framing and drywall phase was $220,000, an amount JMR\nassumed would be sufficient to perform the work in an orderly fashion and with a\nreasonable crew size. Rivard testified he was unaware of any mistakes in the bid, and\nopined that $220,000 was a reasonable cost for that phase of the Project.\n       Craig Connerty, a certified public accountant with 27 years of experience, testified\nas an expert on JMR’s behalf. JMR had been a client of Connerty’s accounting firm for\nover 15 years. Connerty reviewed the costs posted in JMR’s books allocated to the\nframing and drywall phase of the Project. He testified that the total costs allocated to this\nphase was $461,535, and he reviewed the subcategories of those costs. Connerty “did a\nlot of testing with regard to the accounts for reasonableness” by selecting a number of\ndifferent invoices for review before arriving at the $461,535 figure. Connerty also noted\nthat this figure should be reduced by approximately $48,200 to account for costs that,\nbased upon his conversation with Rivard, were erroneously posted to the framing and\ndrywall phase.\n       Perez offered testimony relating to disruption damages for the framing and\ndrywall phase. In forming his opinion, Perez spoke with job superintendent Steven\nHupaylo, project manager Daniel Spade, and JMR’s vice president Ron Rivard. Perez\nalso reviewed documents identifying the costs of the framing and drywall phase; certified\npayroll figures indicating the number of workers on the job site during that phase; and\nother correspondence. Perez relied on Hupaylo’s testimony to the effect “that every wall\nwas impacted by EAR’s performance, meaning that the impacts and the costs [were]\nintrinsically intertwined [and it was] difficult if not impractical or impossible to segregate\n[the] individual impacts.” In calculating disruption damages, Perez performed a\n“modified total cost analysis.” He described this approach as follows: “[Y]ou would\ntake a selected portion of the contractor’s costs that he incurred and subtract from that the\n\n\n                                             24\n\fcontractor’s budget for those items, removing . . . items which were not part of the\noriginal budget . . . to ensure you’re comparing apples to apples.”\n       Thus, one component of Perez’s calculation was the original bid. Perez did an\nindependent analysis of JMR’s bid for the framing and drywall phase. He found that\nRivard’s bid contained the kind of detail indicative of a good estimate, the bid used\nmethods that were “consistent with other contractors,” and the bid was “based on\nhistoric[al] information[,] which is also important.” Perez testified that he “was satisfied”\nwith Rivard’s bid and that the numbers within it “appeared reasonable.” He noted that in\ncomparing the material costs in the bid with the actual material costs, “the material\nestimate was almost dead on.” He also noted that because labor estimates are based upon\nthe material scheduled, the fact that the actual cost of materials was consistent with the\nestimate for those materials was “a good indication of a good estimate.” He concluded\nthat “if your material estimate is off, your labor estimate would be off. And Mr. Rivard’s\nmaterial estimate was on, was accurate.”\n       Perez also reviewed the “logged” costs that related to the framing and drywall\nphase of the Project. This amount totaled $461,534. Perez subtracted the costs that had\nbeen incorrectly allocated to the framing and drywall phase. These were the same figures\nidentified in the testimony of JMR’s accounting expert, Craig Connerty. Perez also\nsubtracted a per diem figure associated with the erroneously posted costs. Perez then\ncalculated the total amount of disruption damages allocable to EAR relating to the\nframing and drywall phase, which he determined to be $185,729.\n                     2.     Standards of Review\n       An appellant’s challenge to damages, depending upon its specific nature, may be\nsubject to a substantial evidence, abuse of discretion, or de novo standard of review. The\nquestion of whether a plaintiff was, in fact, damaged by the defendant’s breach of\ncontract is reviewed for substantial evidence. (See GHK Associates v.

But where the measure of\ndamages is legally permissible, a trial court’s choice of that measure, among other legally\npermissible measures of damages, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (New West, at\np. 843, citing GHK, at p. 873.)\n       EAR contends that neither the Eichleay formula nor the modified total cost\nmethod was legally authorized in this case. EAR does not make the further argument\nthat, assuming the legal validity of these damage calculations, the court abused its\ndiscretion by selecting them over other legally permissible methods of computing\ndamages. Accordingly, we review the legal propriety of the court’s use of the two\ndamages calculations de novo. In addition, EAR contends that, even assuming the legal\nvalidity of the Eichleay formula, JMR failed to establish the requisite elements for its\napplication, a question we review under the substantial evidence standard of review.\n                     3.     Challenges to the Eichleay Formula\n                            a.      The Eichleay Formula\n       As explained by JMR’s expert, Juan Perez, the Eichleay formula “is a method of\nallocating those home office overhead costs to a project that [have] been extended or\ndelayed.” It originated from a case before the Armed Services Board of Contract\nAppeals (see Eichleay Corp. (A.S.B.C.A.1960) 60-2 BCA (CCH) 2688), and it is\ntypically used in federal litigation involving federal public works projects. (See, e.g., P.J.\nDick Inc. v.

[Citation.] In contracting with the\ngovernment, a company necessarily includes a portion of home office overhead expenses,\nwhich it calculates based on the contract’s duration, in its estimate of costs to perform the\ncontract. [Citation.] When the government delays or disrupts contract performance,\nultimately requiring that it be extended, the contractor’s stream of income from the\ngovernment for the direct costs it has incurred under the contract is reduced or\ninterrupted. [Citation.] However, home office overhead continues to accrue throughout\nboth the original and extended performance periods, regardless of direct contract activity.\n[Citations.] This, of course, results in a reduction or interruption of payments for\noverhead, especially when, as here, the contractor has prepared a critical path schedule,\nfor any delay along the critical path results in the delay of the overall project.”\n(Altmayer, supra, 79 F.3d at p. 1132.)\n       There are three steps in the calculation of extended overhead using the Eichleay\nformula. They are (1) “to find [the] allocable contract overhead [by] multiply[ing] the\ntotal overhead cost incurred during the contract period times the ratio of billings from the\ndelayed contract to total billings of the firm during the contract period; [(2)] to get the\ndaily contract overhead rate, divide allocable contract overhead by days of contract\nperformance; and [(3)] to get the amount recoverable, multiply the daily contract\noverhead rate times days of government-caused delay.

Legal Propriety of Using Eichleay Formula\n       EAR argues it was improper for the court to accept JMR’s proffer of the Eichleay\nformula to establish its unabsorbed overhead damages caused by EAR’s concurrent\ndelay. EAR asserts there is no legal precedent for applying the formula because (1) there\n                                              27\n\fhave been no published California decisions endorsing its use, and (2) there is no legal\nauthority authorizing its use in situations, such as here, where the defendant causing the\ndelay was not the government. EAR also urges that Perez, JMR’s expert, “admitted\napplication of the Eichleay formula is ‘debated.’ ”5\n       Under Civil Code section 3300, a party may recover for a breach of contract a sum\nthat will compensate it “for all the detriment proximately caused thereby, or which, in the\nordinary course of things, will be likely to result therefrom.” “[I]n the law of contracts\nthe theory is that the party injured by a breach should receive as nearly as possible the\nequivalent of the benefits of performance.

A subcontractor who is responsible for delaying\nthe progress of a construction project may be held liable for delay damages incurred by\nthe general contractor or by another subcontractor. (10 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate\n(3d ed. 2001) § 27:39, p. 109.) Increased overhead expenses incurred by a general\ncontractor as a result of the subcontractor’s breach may be an item of recoverable\ndamages. (See Allen v. Gardner (1954) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1118792\"><a href=\"/opinion/1118792/allen-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Attorney’s Guide\nto Damages (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2014) § 1.49, p. 1-50.) Extended home office overhead\nis one type of delay damages for which a contractor may seek recovery. (See Cal.\nConstruction Contracts, Defects, and Litigation (Cont.Ed.Bar 2013) §§ 5.107, 6.86, pp.\n394, 537; Gibbs & Hunt, Cal. Construction Law (17th ed. 2011) Construction Claims,\n§ 6.07[F], p. 441.)\n       We acknowledge there are no reported California appellate decisions approving\nthe use of the Eichleay formula. In the only reported California case addressing the\nformula, the appellate court did not decide the legal propriety of its use because the\nmunicipality against which such damages were sought did not dispute the formula’s\n                                              29\n\fgeneral applicability to construction delay claims.

As has been observed in one\ntreatise: “The federal government developed the Eichleay formula to compute the\namount of home office overhead expense for which a government contractor should be\nreimbursed for a period of delay. Although the formula has not been discussed in a\nreported California case, it is frequently used at the trial court level and in arbitration\nproceedings to compute damages.” (Cal. Construction Contracts, Defects, and Litigation,\nsupra, § 5.107, p. 394.)6\n       That the circumstances of this case are different from those in which Eichleay\ndamages are typically discussed in reported decisions—i.e., the general contractor\nseeking delay damages from a subcontractor, rather than from a governmental\nagency/owner—does not preclude use of the formula. JMR presented unrebutted\ntestimony from Daniel Spade that because there were concurrent delays, the Corps\nrejected JMR’s effort to recover extended overhead damages from the Corps. And\nJMR’s construction management expert, John Elmer, testified that when the owner of a\npublic works project causes delay, but a subcontractor or subcontractors concurrently\ncause delay, the owner may grant the general contractor additional time but it will not\ngrant the general contractor compensable time (i.e., delay damages). Elmer testified that\nunder such circumstances, the general contractor will typically seek delay damages from\nthe subcontractor under the theory that the general contractor “should have recovered\n\n\n       6\n         We acknowledge it is stated elsewhere in the treatise that, because California\ncourts have not adopted the Eichleay formula in any published decision, “[t]he\napplicability of [it] to public or private construction projects in California is\nquestionable.” (Cal. Construction Contracts, Defects, and Litigation, supra, § 6.86,\np. 538.)\n                                              30\n\fcompensable time, but . . . was precluded from [doing so] because of [the\nsubcontractor’s] delay.” (See William F.

EAR presented\nno expert testimony of its own to rebut JMR’s expert testimony concerning Eichleay\ndamages.\n       We conclude the trial court did not err in applying the Eichleay formula as a\nlegally permissible method of determining JMR’s home office overhead damages. We\nbase this conclusion upon the expert evidence presented at trial, the general recoverability\nof extended home office overhead as an element of delay damages, and the federal\ncourts’ general acceptance of the Eichleay formula. In other words, the calculation of\nextended home office overhead damages using the Eichleay formula was an appropriate\nmethod to compensate JMR “for all the detriment proximately caused” by EAR’s breach\nof contract. (Civ. Code, § 3300.) That recovery facilitates “[t]he goal [of placing] the\nplaintiff ‘in as good a position as he or she would have occupied’ if the defendant had not\nbreached the contract. [Citation.]” (Lewis Jorge, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 967, quoting 24\nWilliston on Contracts (4th ed.2002) § 64:1, p. 7.) Indeed, it would be anomalous to\nallow recovery to JMR for Eichleay extended home office overhead damages in a claim\nagainst the government-owner—had there been no concurrent delay and where, as here,\nJMR had established the fact of such damages and causation—while denying such\nrecovery from EAR where EAR was concurrently responsible for the delay.\n\n\n                                            31\n\f                             c.     Proof of Elements of Eichleay Formula\n       EAR also challenges the use of the Eichleay formula on the basis that JMR did not\nestablish the requisite elements for its application. The federal courts have identified\nthree Eichleay requirements. “[T]he contractor [must] establish: (1) a government-\ncaused delay; (2) that [the contractor] was on ‘standby’; and (3) that [the contractor] was\nunable to take on other work. [Citation.]” (Altmayer, supra, 79 F.3d at p. 1133.) EAR\nasserts there was no evidence JMR was unable to take on other work.\n       JMR presented evidence, through Perez, concerning JMR’s inability to obtain\nother work. Perez’s expert testimony was based in large part upon his conversations with\nRivard and JMR’s bonding agent, Sharon Rusconi. Perez testified that JMR was a\nwoman-owned business that received work on Small Business Administration Section 8A\nprojects. Such projects are not strictly bid competitively; contract awards are largely\ndependent on the contractor’s ratings. Perez testified that as a result of Project delays\nduring the 142-day concurrent delay period, JMR’s rating was downgraded to marginal.\nThis rating downgrade negatively impacted JMR’s ability to obtain new work. Rivard\ninformed Perez that during the period of November 2007 through sometime in 2008,\nJMR could not obtain a bid bond. JMR was thus precluded from bidding on public\nprojects and could not get other work.7\n       This evidence constituted substantial evidence of the third Eichleay prerequisite,\ni.e., “that [JMR] was unable to take on other work. [Citation.]” (Altmayer, supra,\n79 F.3d at p. 1133.) Accordingly, EAR’s claim that there was insufficient evidence\nsupporting application of the Eichleay formula fails.8\n\n       7\n          EAR did not assert any evidentiary objections at trial to this testimony, forfeiting\nany such objections on appeal. (See SCI Cal. Funeral Services, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 563-565 [appellant’s challenges to admissibility of expert testimony forfeited due\nto failure to preserve them in trial court].)\n        8\n          EAR also argues JMR’s damages were improperly calculated because Perez\nincluded impermissible expenses such as advertising and entertainment as part of its\n                                              32\n\f                      3.     Challenges to Modified Total Cost Method\n       EAR contends the court erred in several respects in using the modified total cost\nmethod in its award of delay damages relating to the framing and drywall phase. “The\ntotal cost method derives damages as the difference between a contractor’s actual costs\nand its original bid.” (Servidone Const. Corp. v. U.S. (Fed.Cir. 1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560001\"><a href=\"/opinion/560001/servidone-construction-corporation-plaintiffcross-appellant-v-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 861.)\nIn the event some of the costs of the contractor are deemed unreasonable or were the\nresult of “its own errors or omissions, then those costs are subtracted from the damages to\narrive at a modified total cost.

Although not favored,\nthe total cost method—along with its subcategory, the modified total cost method—has\nbeen recognized in California as an appropriate way of computing damages. (See, e.g.,\n\n\n\nhome office overhead. But Perez testified that the advertising and entertainment\nexpenses were insignificant and did not affect his calculation under the Eichleay formula.\n                                                 33\n\fGuy F.

Further, although our high court in Amelco—\nbecause the municipality did not contest the issue—declined to decide whether the total\ncost formula was an appropriate method of calculating damages in a breach of a public\ncontract case (Amelco, at p. 242), the Second District Court of Appeal, Division Two,\nconcluded that the Amelco court in fact upheld common law principles “permit[ting] a\npublic contractor to pursue either a total cost theory or a modified total cost theory.”\n(Dillingham-Ray Wilson, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at p. 1408.) The court reached this\nconclusion because Amelco cited Guy F. Atkinson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and did not\ndisapprove of the result in that case. (Dillingham-Ray Wilson, at p. 1408.)\n       The California Supreme Court has emphasized that one of the major concerns in\nthe use of the total cost method is that it not be used as “ ‘a substitute for proof of\ncausation.’ [Citation.]” (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 244.) Here, there was\nsubstantial evidence of a causal connection between the extra cost JMR incurred in the\nProject’s framing and drywall phase and EAR’s breach of contract. Moreover, the\ncautionary statement in Amelco that the total cost method “ ‘should be applied only to the\nsmallest affected portion of the contractual relationship that can be clearly identified’\n[citation]” was heeded: JMR used the modified total cost method to calculate damages\nrelated only to the framing and drywall phase of the Project, not to damages related to the\nentire Project.\n       EAR also contends there was a lack of evidence to support a finding of the four\nprerequisites recited in Amelco (hereafter the Amelco elements) for use of the modified\ntotal cost method. As we discuss below, the trial court specifically addressed each of the\nAmelco elements in its statement of decision, and substantial evidence supported the\ncourt’s conclusions that JMR established each element.\n\n\n                                              34\n\f       The trial court specifically found JMR had established the first Amelco element—\n“the impracticality of proving actual losses directly.” (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at\np. 243.) In so concluding, the court cited the testimony of JMR’s job superintendent,\nSteven Hupaylo, which it found credible. As the court stated, Hupaylo had testified that\nJMR had a good design for performing the framing and drywall work, but he (Hupaylo)\n“had to wait for EAR to complete its rough-in work before he could complete the walls,\nand, because of EAR’s delays, he never had all four walls and a ceiling in any room to\nwork with.” The trial court concluded: “Consequently, the disruption occurred\nthroughout the entire period of that work, was not confined to one particular section or\ntime, so [it] could not be tracked specifically as the disruption occurred.” Furthermore,\nPerez testified, based upon Hupaylo’s testimony, that because “every wall was impacted\nby EAR’s performance, [this] mean[t] that the impacts and the costs are intrinsically\nintertwined [and it is] difficult if not impractical or impossible to segregate [the]\nindividual impacts.”\n       The trial court also found JMR had established the second Amelco element, i.e.,\nthe reasonableness of its bid. (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 243; see Gibbs & Hunt,\nCal. Construction Law, supra, Construction Claims, § 6.14[A], p. 471 [stressing the\nimportance of accuracy of bid estimate to contractor’s claim under total cost method].)\nThe court noted that (1) Rivard, as an expert experienced in estimating, testified\nconcerning his methodology for preparing his bid, and opined that the bid for the framing\nand drywall phase was reasonable; (2) Perez reviewed the bid, noted that Rivard’s\nmethodology was consistent with other contractors and was based upon historical\ninformation, and was satisfied it was accurate; (3) Perez opined the $220,000 stated in the\nbid was a reasonable cost for the framing and drywall phase; and (4) EAR offered no\nexpert testimony to rebut or contradict the reasonableness of the framing and drywall bid.\n       Likewise, the court concluded JMR’s actual costs for the framing and drywall\nphase were reasonable—the third Amelco element. (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 243.)\n                                              35\n\fIn concluding that “the actual costs were reasonable and accurately recorded,” the trial\ncourt cited to the testimony of JMR’s experts, Connerty and Perez. It noted that\nConnerty reviewed JMR’s costs associated with the framing and drywall phase, and that\nConnerty’s work was “substantial.” The trial court indicated that Connerty “did not just\naccept JMR’s numbers; he [‘]did a lot of testing[’] of the accounts for reasonableness by\nactually reviewing a number of invoices, and conducted an independent analysis.”\n       Finally, the trial court found JMR was not responsible for the added costs—the\nfourth Amelco element. (Amelco, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 243.) It concluded EAR was\nsolely at fault for the disruption in the completion of the framing and drywall phase. The\ncourt cited the testimony of Hupaylo that because of EAR’s delays in “not having\nmaterials, not having skilled people, and sometimes not having any people working at all,\nJMR’s crews had to work piecemeal” and in an inefficient manner to complete the work.\nThe court “accept[ed] the testimony of Steve Hupaylo as accurate.” It also relied on\nPerez’s testimony that, based upon his review of certified payroll records, “the number of\n[EAR] workers reported on the certified payroll corresponded with the low percentage of\ncompletion.” Perez also testified that EAR’s rough-in work took four months to\ncomplete, notwithstanding that EAR had scheduled 34 days for the work. The trial court\nagreed with Perez’s “conclusion that . . . JMR was confronted with the incomplete work\nand stacking of trades, which disrupted its efficiency.”\n       EAR points to testimony it presented to suggest that JMR’s cost overruns were\ndue to its hiring of expensive out-of-town labor and the high level of quality required for\nthe drywall finish. But the trial court rejected these arguments. The court indicated in its\nstatement of decision that “Pendurthi’s contrary conclusory explanations [regarding the\nframing and drywall disruption we]re not credible,” and the court found Pendurthi’s\n“testimony weak and unreliable.” Moreover—as was the case with JMR’s presentation\nof Eichleay damages—EAR offered no expert testimony to contradict JMR’s showing\n\n\n                                             36\n\fthat the modified total cost method was appropriate for calculating its damages associated\nwith the framing and drywall phase.\n       As a variant of its contention that the court erred in concluding JMR was not\nresponsible for the added cost, EAR argues, quoting from Amelco at p. 246, that damages\nwere not recoverable under this method because JMR did not “ ‘distinguish between\nthose inefficiencies that were [JMR’s] and those believed to be the responsibility of the\n[Army] (and presumably other prime contractors and subcontractors).’ ” But the court\nrejected EAR’s contention that JMR was responsible for inefficiencies in the framing and\ndrywall phase, and there was substantial evidence to support the court’s conclusion.\n       Lastly, EAR contends the disruption damages awarded by the court were\n“admittedly inaccurately calculated” because they failed to account for a $90,000\nmiscoding error about which Rivard testified. This argument relates to cross-examination\nin which defendants’ counsel asked if Rivard had given prior deposition testimony to the\neffect that there was an approximate $90,000 miscoding of costs that were not related to\nthe framing and drywall phase of the Project. Defendants raised this issue twice in their\nposttrial briefing. The trial court addressed this contention in its statement of decision.\nThe court concluded that Rivard’s deposition testimony concerning the “$90,000 coding\novercharge” was essentially superseded by testimony from Perez and Connerty that,\nshortly before trial, Rivard advised them that the adjustment for miscoded items was\napproximately $48,200.9 The trial court thus characterized the $90,000 coding error as a\n“relatively unfocused pre-trial examination estimate” that did not warrant further\nconsideration in its award of damages. Giving deference to the court’s role as trier of\n\n\n       9\n        The statement of decision recites that the figure given by Rivard to Perez and\nConnerty shortly before trial was “a final $428,200 adjustment for items that were\nproperly counted for tasks other than metal studs and drywall.” This is an obvious\ntypographical error, as Connerty testified the figure was “$48,200 and something” and\nPerez testified the figure was $48,262.\n\n                                             37\n\ffact, we conclude there was no error in disregarding the purported $90,000 coding error\nin determining JMR’s disruption damages.\n       We thus conclude there was no legal impediment to JMR’s use of the modified\ntotal cost method of calculating its damages associated with the framing and drywall\nphase of the Project. The trial court was justified in concluding that JMR had established\neach of the four Amelco elements required for utilizing this method. (Amelco, supra,\n27 Cal.4th at p. 243.) The fact that the damages claimed using this formula may have\nonly been a reasonable approximation of JMR’s loss associated with this phase of the\nProject is not an obstacle to its use, since the fact of such damages was established by\nsubstantial evidence. (Acree, supra, 92 Cal.App.4th at p. 398.)\n              C.     EAR’s Challenges to the Statement of Decision\n       Interwoven throughout its briefs on appeal is EAR’s challenge to the legal\nsufficiency of the trial court’s statement of decision. Citing repeatedly to Duff v. Duff\n(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 781—a case that predated by 14 years the Legislature’s\namendment of section 632 to provide a procedure governing statements of decision in\ncivil trials (see Stats. 1981, ch. 900, § 1, p. 3425)—EAR claims that because of the\ncourt’s alleged failure to make findings, “reversal of the Judgment . . . is compelled.” We\nconclude the statement of decision is legally sufficient..\n       Section 632 provides in relevant part: “The court shall issue a statement of\ndecision explaining the factual and legal basis for its decision as to each of the principal\ncontroverted issues at trial upon the [timely] request of any party appearing at the trial.”\nThe statement of decision need only “ ‘state ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.’ ” (In\nre Marriage of Garrity and Bishton (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123695\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123695/in-re-marriage-of-garrity-and-bishton/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

SureTec’s Challenge to the Judgment Due to Lack of Default Notice\n       SureTec contends the trial court erred in finding it liable under the performance\nbonds because JMR failed to give it (SureTec) notice of EAR’s default under the\nsubcontracts. SureTec argues that a “declaration of default was a condition precedent to\nSureTec’s liability.” It also argues that, looking at the language of the bonds as a whole,\nthere was an implied requirement that JMR provide a notice of default to SureTec as a\ncondition precedent to SureTec’s liability under the bonds.\n       There was undisputed evidence, based upon Rivard’s testimony, that JMR did not\nformally declare EAR in default under either subcontract. Nor did JMR ask SureTec to\ncomplete the bonded work under either subcontract. At trial, Cynthia Vincent, a SureTec\nvice-president, testified that SureTec received no notice of any default under the\nplumbing or electrical subcontracts. She also testified that SureTec was not given the\nopportunity to complete work under either subcontract, and that JMR never asked\nSureTec to obtain new plumbing or electrical subcontractors.\n              A.     Contractual Conditions Generally\n       A conditional obligation is one in which “the rights or duties of any party thereto\ndepend upon the occurrence of an uncertain event.” (Civ. Code, § 1434; see also Rest.2d,\nContracts, § 224: “A condition is an event, not certain to occur, which must occur, unless\nits non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due.”)\n“[P]arties may expressly agree that a right or duty is conditional upon the occurrence or\n                                            41\n\fnonoccurrence of an act or event.” (Platt Pacific, Inc. v.

Performance bonds typically\nincorporate by reference the general contract or subcontract for which the bond was\nissued. As such, “ ‘the bond and the contract should be read together and construed fairly\nand reasonably as a whole according to the intention of the parties.’ [Citations.]” (Id. at\n                                               43\n\fpp. 39-40; see also Pacific Employers, at p. 150 [generally, “contract performance bond\nwill be read with the contract”].)\n          Each subcontract here requires EAR to furnish JMR, as the named obligee, a\nperformance bond and a payment bond “to secure the faithful performance of the\nSubcontract Work and to satisfy all Subcontractor payment obligations related to the\nSubcontract Work.” On November 10, 2006, SureTec issued separate performance bonds\nfor EAR’s electrical subcontract and its plumbing subcontract, listing the penal amounts\nof the bonds as $732,500 and $471,881, respectively. Each performance bond\nspecifically incorporates by reference the respective subcontract for which the bond was\nissued.\n          The one-page “Articles” of the two performance bonds contain identical language.\nArticle 1, containing the heading “SCOPE OF BOND” (emphasis omitted), states: “The\nPrincipal [EAR] and the Surety [SureTec], jointly and severally, bind themselves . . . to\nthe Obligee [JMR] for the performance of the Subcontract.” Under the heading\n“EFFECT OF OBLIGATION” (emphasis omitted), Article 2 provides: “If the Principal\nperforms the Subcontract, then this bond shall be null and void; otherwise it shall remain\nin full force and effect.” Article 4, under the heading “PRINCIPAL DEFAULT”\n(emphasis omitted), provides: “Whenever the Principal shall be, and is declared by the\nObligee to be in default under the Subcontract, with the Obligee having performed its\nobligations in the Subcontract, the Surety may promptly remedy the default, or shall\npromptly” (1) “[c]omplete the Subcontract in accordance with its terms and conditions”;\n(2) retain a new subcontractor to complete the Principal’s work under the subcontract;\n(3) pay the Obligee the amount for which the Surety is liable; or (4) deny liability in\nwhole or in part, providing an explanation for doing so.\n          Each subcontract details JMR’s right to deduct or withhold payments to EAR, and\nJMR’s rights in the event of EAR’s breach. Furthermore, each subcontract specifically\nrequires JMR to provide written notice to EAR in a number of circumstances. Those\n                                             44\n\fcircumstances include where (1) JMR elects to deduct from amounts otherwise due to\nEAR any sums EAR owes JMR; (2) JMR “deems it necessary and desirable to [withhold\npayments due to EAR to] protect itself against possible loss or damages”; (3) JMR\nconcludes EAR has failed to (a) supply sufficient skilled workers, (b) adhere to the work\nschedule, (c) pay workers or suppliers, (d) follow the law, or (e) has otherwise materially\nbreached the subcontract, requiring JMR to give EAR notice to cure the default; (4) JMR\nelects to suspend EAR’s work under the subcontract; (5) the owner suspends its\nagreement with JMR; (6) JMR elects to terminate the subcontract due to EAR’s material\ndefault of its obligations under the subcontract, after having given EAR written notice to\ncure; and (7) the owner terminates its agreement with JMR. None of these notice\nprovisions requires JMR to give written notice to the surety, SureTec. Furthermore, each\nsubcontract provides that the surety need not be advised of any changes, additions, or\nomissions to the subcontract.\n              C.     Discussion\n       SureTec implicitly acknowledges that neither performance bond expressly\nprovides that JMR must give notice to SureTec of EAR’s default as a condition precedent\nto SureTec’s liability. But it asserts that “[a] contractual provision need not be expressly\nlabeled ‘condition precedent’ to be treated as such. Rather, whether a provision is a\ncondition precedent is to be determined from the whole contract, its purpose, and the\nintention of the parties.” Quoting from Wal-Noon Corp. v. Hill (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2129601\"><a href=\"/opinion/2129601/wal-noon-corp-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

And the default provisions in the subcontracts—incorporated by\nreference into the bonds—include requirements in several instances that JMR give notice\nto EAR without any similar requirement of giving notice to SureTec. Thus, the bonds do\nnot contain the requisite “clear, unambiguous language” (Alpha Beta Food, supra,\n45 Cal.2d at p. 771) that would support a finding that JMR was required to provide a\nnotice of default to SureTec as a condition precedent to liability under the bonds.\n       Pacific Allied v.

There, the defendant (Century) agreed to fabricate and sell steel forms to\nplaintiff (Pacific) for the purpose of using them to install storm drains. (Id. at p. 72.)\nCentury also guaranteed that Pacific’s labor costs, through its use of Century’s steel\nforms, would not exceed four cents per square foot, and that Century would, upon\ncompletion of the job and Pacific’s submission of an itemized cost breakdown, pay\nPacific’s labor costs in excess of four cents per square foot. (Id. at p. 73.) Pacific agreed\nto keep a detailed account of labor costs and give Century a “continuous report.” (Ibid.)\nPacific kept Century apprised of costs during the project and gave it periodic oral reports,\nbut it did not provide a detailed cost breakdown upon the project’s completion. (Id. at\np. 78.) The court rejected Century’s contention that Pacific was required to provide a\ndetailed cost breakdown as a condition precedent to its recovery under the contract. (Id.\nat pp. 79-80.) The appellate court held that (1) conditions precedent are not favored in\nthe law; (2) neither the express terms of the contract nor a reasonable implication drawn\nfrom them compelled a finding that providing the cost breakdown was condition\nprecedent to Pacific’s recovery; and (3) the interpretation advanced by Century was\nparticularly disfavored because it would result in a forfeiture. (Id. at pp. 79-80.)\n       Here, as in Pacific Allied, there was no language expressly conditioning SureTec’s\nperformance under the bonds upon receipt of a notice of default from JMR. In Pacific\nAllied, there was an express agreement by the plaintiff to provide some level of\n\n\n                                              46\n\fnotification (a detailed cost breakdown) to the defendant. Here, there was no such\nexpress covenant requiring JMR to provide any notice to SureTec.\n       We conclude that SureTec’s receipt of a declaration of default by JMR is not a\ncondition precedent to triggering SureTec’s liability under the bonds. This interpretation\nnecessarily defeats SureTec’s argument that a condition precedent should be implied\nfrom the language of the bonds. This interpretation is also consistent with the statutory\nmandate that courts, in construing an instrument, shall “ ‘not [] insert what has been\nomitted, or [] omit what has been inserted.’ ” (Edwards v.

Here, Article 1 of\neach bond creates the unconditional obligation to the effect that EAR and SureTec\n“jointly and severally, bind themselves . . . to [JMR] for the performance of the\nSubcontract.”\n       SureTec contends that, notwithstanding Article 1, its obligation here was\ndischarged under Article 2 of the performance bonds, which reads: “If the Principal\nperforms the Subcontract, then this bond shall be null and void; otherwise it shall remain\nin full force and effect.” SureTec asserts that because EAR performed its obligations by\ncompleting its work under the subcontracts, the bonds became “null and void” under\nArticle 2. This contention has no merit.\n                                            47\n\f       As discussed in detail, ante, the trial court found, based upon substantial evidence,\nthat EAR breached the plumbing and electrical subcontracts by, among other things,\ndelayed performance under the contracts and by disrupting the efficient completion of the\nframing and drywall phase of the Project. EAR’s breach gave JMR the option to\nterminate the subcontracts, but it was not required to do so. (See Whitney Inv. Co. v.\nWestview Development Co. (1969) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2214432\"><a href=\"/opinion/2214432/whitney-inv-co-v-westview-dev-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 602.) That JMR did not\nterminate the subcontracts as a result of EAR’s breach does not absolve EAR of\nresponsibility for breaching the contracts. “[Breach of contract d]amages for delay can\nresult from either a total or partial failure of performance. In both cases, delay damages\nare an extra item of recovery in addition to the normal measure of damages. However,\neven when there has been complete performance of a contract, damages for delay can\nresult when performance was not completed on time.” (Cal. Attorney’s Guide to\nDamages, supra, § 1.49, pp. 1-49 to 1-50.)\n       Furthermore, under general suretyship law, Civil Code section 2807 provides that\n“[a] surety who has assumed liability for payment or performance is liable to the creditor\nimmediately upon the default of the principal, and without demand or notice.” (Italics\nadded; see Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group\n2015) ¶ 6:3436, pp. 6I-72 to 6I-73 [“if the bond is silent, the obligee is not required to\ngive the surety notice of the principal’s default or make demand upon the surety for\npayment”].)\n       Thus, for instance, in State Bd. of Equalization v. Balboa Ins. Co. (1978)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the surety was held liable on sales tax surety bonds after the\nprincipal’s default, notwithstanding the obligee’s (State Board of Equalization’s) failure\nto make demand for payment or its failure to include the surety on a notice of lien. (Id. at\npp. 503-504.) The court explained that when the surety executed the surety bonds, “it did\nnot put conditions of special or separate notice” upon its “agreement to stand good for\n[the principal’s] tax liability.” (Id. at p. 504.) Citing Civil Code section 2807, the court\n                                             48\n\fheld the surety was liable under the bonds because neither the law nor the agreement\nrequired notice as a condition to the surety’s liability. (Ibid.)\n       SureTec relies on several out-of-state cases to support its contention that a\ndeclaration of EAR’s default by JMR to SureTec was a condition precedent to JMR’s\nrecovery under the bonds. Several of these cases were based upon the courts’\ninterpretation of the relevant contracts under applicable Florida law. (See, e.g., L&A\nContracting v.

But L&A Contracting, and other cases relied on by SureTec, did not\ninvolve a contractual interpretation of performance bonds under California law. And\nnone of those authorities considered the appropriateness of implying a condition\nprecedent relating to default notice in light of decisional authority prohibiting such a\nconstruction unless the contractual language plainly requires it. (See Rubin v. Fuch,\nsupra, 1 Cal.3d at p. 53; Alpha Beta Food, supra, 45 Cal.2d at p. 771.) Indeed, L&A\nContracting does not discuss conditions precedent generally or the appropriateness of\n                                              49\n\fimplying a condition not expressly stated in a contract. We therefore decline to follow\nthe out-of-state authorities relied upon by SureTec. (See People v. Uribe (2011)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Cates Construction, supra, 21 Cal.4th at\npp. 39-40.) A number of provisions in the EAR subcontracts require JMR to give notice\nto EAR; none of these provisions requires notice to SureTec. The performance bonds\nthemselves contain no express requirement of any notice to the surety. The only mention\nof notice in either bond is a provision under which SureTec waives notice of any\nalteration or extension of the referenced subcontract. Reading Article 1 together with\nArticle 2 of each bond—in conjunction with the language of the subcontracts\nincorporated by reference—yields the conclusion that SureTec’s obligation to JMR in the\nevent of EAR’s breach of the underlying subcontract is unconditional. (See id. at p. 41\n[considering the documents “as a whole, the bond and underlying construction contract\nare fairly and reasonably read as requiring” surety to answer for principal’s failure to\nperform under contract].)\n       We conclude the performance bonds did not require JMR to give notice of default\nto SureTec as a condition precedent to recovery under the bonds. Any interpretation of\nthe bonds as implying such a condition precedent would be contrary to (1) suretyship\nprinciples (see Civ. Code, §§ 2806, 2807), and (2) the principle that conditions precedent\nshould not be implied unless the construction is compelled by the clear language of the\nagreement, particularly here, where such an implied condition would result in a\nforfeiture.

It argues that it\n“clearly and unambiguously prevailed” on the two causes of action for breach of contract\nalleged in its cross-complaint. SureTec contends the award of attorney fees against it was\nlegally improper because the scope of its liability under the performance bonds did not\nextend to attorney fees incurred by JMR to defend the unmeritorious cross-complaint\nfiled by SureTec’s principal, EAR. We must consider initially whether defendants’\nclaims are cognizable on appeal. (See Jennings v.

The lessees, without the lessors’\nknowledge, replaced the premises’ leaky roof, and later sought reimbursement from the\nlessors because the lease had imposed upon the lessors the obligation to repair and\nreplace the roof and all exterior walls. (Id. at pp. 608-610.) The appellate court\nconcluded that “notice as a condition precedent to the lessors’ obligation to repair is not\nonly clearly apparent from the terms of the written lease, it is indispensable to effectuate\nthe intentions of the parties. [Citation.] It has been held that unless explicitly excluded\ntherein, performance under an express covenant to repair is conditional upon notice from\nthe tenant. [Citations.] Accordingly, we hold that notice is an indispensable condition\nprecedent to [the lessors’] duty to perform under the covenant to repair” (Id. at p. 612.)\nHere, we address surety bonds and a surety-obligee relationship, not a commercial lease\nand a landlord-tenant relationship. Thus, the facts of Wal-Noon are distinguishable. This\ncase, unlike Wal-Noon, requires application of suretyship principles (e.g., Civil Code\nsections 2806 and 2807). Those principles, along with the absence of a clear indication\nthat the parties intended otherwise, compel our conclusion that notice of default to\nSureTec was not an implied condition precedent to recovery under the bonds.\n\n                                            51\n\fThe court’s tentative decision regarding that motion, in which it cited Johnson v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, was twofold: (1) JMR, because it did not seek mediation of\nits claims before filing suit, was not entitled to attorney fees for pursuing its complaint;\nbut (2) JMR was entitled to attorney fees for its defense of EAR’s cross-complaint.\n       In its written order of November 13, 2012, the court, among other things, ordered\nJMR to calculate the amount of attorney fees incurred before the filing of EAR’s cross-\ncomplaint. The court also set a deadline for that submission and for a response by\ndefendants. The court further indicated in its order that it would “issue an award of\nAttorney Fees to JMR, consistent with its tentative ruling on November 2, 2012.”13 The\nrecord does not include an order fixing an amount of fees entered subsequent to the\ncourt’s November 13, 2012 order. EAR has indicated in its opening brief that it\nexpressly reserves the right to appeal any such order fixing the amount of attorney fees.\nAnd the parties at oral argument on November 19, 2015, indicated that, as of that date,\nthe court had not yet issued an order fixing the amount of attorney fees awardable to\nJMR.\n       A postjudgment award of attorney fees is generally appealable pursuant to section\n904.1, subdivision (a)(1).

But “if a judgment determines that a party is entitled to\nattorney’s fees but does not determine the amount, that portion of the judgment is\nnonfinal and nonappealable.” (P R Burke Corp. v.

This conclusion\nis based upon the principle that an order that contemplates further action by the court is\nnot final. (See Koshak v.

We\nassume the trial court was referring to its tentative ruling made at the hearing on\nNovember 9, 2012.\n                                              52\n\f       Here, the November 13, 2012 postjudgment order was nonfinal because it did not\nfix an amount of attorney fees awardable to JMR. Rather, it simply adopted the court’s\ntentative ruling denying attorney fees to JMR for its prosecution of the complaint and\ngranting fees for its defense of the cross-complaint. The court specifically contemplated\na future order awarding JMR a fixed amount of attorney fees after the parties submitted\nfurther pleadings. Thus, the order “was nonfinal [because f]urther judicial action was\nnecessary to determine the extent of [JMR’s] entitlement to attorney’s fees.” (P R Burke,\nsupra, 98 Cal.App.4th at p. 1054, italics original.) It was a “ ‘postjudgment’ order[]\n[that] lacked finality in that [it was] also preparatory to later proceedings,” a type of order\nwhich the California Supreme Court has held is generally not appealable. (Lakin v.\nWatkins Associated Industries (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201545\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201545/lakin-v-watkins-associated-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653.) But this conclusion does not\nend our inquiry.\n       SureTec argues somewhat conclusorily that “the trial court’s order that JMR is\nentitled to attorney[] fees is the necessary predicate for its final [] appealable order, also\nentered [] November 13, 2012, that JMR is entitled to $90,644.07 in expert witness fees.”\nWhile we agree with SureTec’s implicit statement that the court utilized its attorney fee\norder in concluding that JMR was entitled to expert witness fees, we disagree with\nSureTec’s ultimate conclusion that we are required to review the court’s interim nonfinal\nattorney fee order here.\n       Under section 906, where an appeal under section 904.1 is taken, “the reviewing\ncourt may review the verdict or decision and any intermediate ruling, proceeding, order\nor decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order\nappealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party.” (See Abramson v.\nJuniper Networks, Inc. (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2281367\"><a href=\"/opinion/2281367/abramson-v-juniper-networks-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 649.) The intermediate order of\nNovember 13, 2012, finding defendants liable to JMR for attorney fees is related to the\ncourt’s order of the same date awarding JMR’s expert witness fees under section 998. As\nwe discuss in section IV, post, the court’s award of expert fees to JMR pursuant to\n                                              53\n\fsection 998 was founded on the assumption that, after aggregating JMR’s monetary\nrecovery under the judgment with its attorney fee award, JMR will recover more than its\npretrial $375,000 offer to compromise. But, as we also discuss, since the court has not\nyet issued a monetary award of fees, its determination that JMR’s total recovery has\nexceeded $375,000 is erroneous. Thus, the court’s November 13, 2012 interim order\ndetermining that JMR is entitled to recover attorney fees in defending EAR’s cross-\ncomplaint is not relevant to our consideration of the appealable order awarding expert\nwitness fees. We therefore decline to consider the nonappealable interim attorney fee\norder at this time.\n       IV.    Award of Expert Fees Pursuant to Section 998\n       After entry of judgment, JMR submitted a memorandum of costs in which it\nclaimed, among other costs, expert witness fees in the total amount of $90,644.07.\nConcurrently with its costs memorandum, JMR filed a brief in which it argued it was\nentitled to recover expert witness fees pursuant to section 998. It asserted that more than\n10 days before trial, in accordance with section 998, it had served identical offers to EAR\nand SureTec in which it offered to have judgment taken against the respective defendants\nin the amount of $375,000 with each side to bear its own costs. JMR argued that because\nit had obtained a judgment that—after adding statutory prevailing-party costs and\nattorney fees to the monetary award of $315,631—exceeded the $375,000 amount of the\noffers, the court in its discretion could award it reasonable postoffer expert witness costs.\nSureTec and EAR filed separate motions to strike/tax costs that included opposition to an\naward to JMR of its expert witness fees.14\n\n\n\n\n       14\n         The motion to tax or strike costs filed by EAR is not included in the appellate\nrecord, but it is referenced in numerous documents included in the record. And EAR’s\nreply memorandum in support of its motion to tax or strike costs, which includes\nargument in opposition to JMR’s request for expert witness fees, is part of the record.\n                                             54\n\f       On November 9, 2012, the court heard argument on defendants’ motions to\nstrike/tax costs. The court then issued an order on November 13, 2012, denying\ndefendants’ parallel motions, thereby awarding JMR expert witness fees of $90,644.07.\nAn order fixing costs and disposing of a motion to tax costs is a separately appealable\norder under section 904.1, subdivision (b). (Grant v. List & Lathrop (1992)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256517\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256517/grant-v-list-lathrop/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 996.)\n       On appeal, EAR and SureTec make identical arguments that the court erred in\nawarding JMR postoffer expert witness costs. They contend the award was improper\nbecause JMR received a judgment of $315,631, nearly $60,000 less than its section 998\noffers. Further, they assert that JMR may only reach the threshold amount of more than\n$375,000 if it is awarded attorney fees exceeding $59,369; defendants both contend that\nno attorney fees should be awarded to JMR. Lastly, defendants posit that an award of\nexpert fees is premature because the court has yet to determine a fixed amount of attorney\nfees awardable to JMR for purposes of determining whether it has obtained a judgment\nmore favorable than the offers pursuant to section 998. We agree with defendants’ third\nargument and will reverse on that basis.\n       Section 998, subdivision (a) provides that “costs allowed under section 1031 and\n1032 shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section.” The statute sets forth a\nprocedure by which a party, not less than 10 days before trial (or arbitration), may serve a\nwritten offer to settle the litigation, including a specification of “the terms and conditions\nof the judgment or award.” (§ 998, subd. (b).) Under subdivision (d), “[i]f an offer made\nby a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable\njudgment . . . the court . . . in its discretion, may require the defendant to pay a reasonable\nsum to cover postoffer costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular\nemployees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both,\npreparation for trial . . . or during trial . . . of the case by the plaintiff, in addition to\nplaintiff’s costs.” Under a parallel provision, a defendant who makes a pretrial offer that\n                                                 55\n\fis not accepted, upon the plaintiff’s failure to obtain a more favorable judgment, may\nrecover, in the court’s discretion, reasonable expert costs incurred by the defendant in\npreparation for trial and trial. (§ 998, subd. (c)(1).) The statute’s purpose “is to\nencourage the settlement of lawsuits prior to trial.” (T. M. Cobb Co. v. Superior Court\n(1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1278754\"><a href=\"/opinion/1278754/tm-cobb-co-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280.)\n       In determining under section (d) if a defendant has failed to obtain a judgment\nmore favorable than a plaintiff’s section 998 offer, where the offer contains a waiver of\ncosts, “ ‘the amount of the judgment is deemed to be the amount of the damages plus the\namount of costs allowed under section 1033.5, subdivision (a).’ [Citation.]” (Wilson v.\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2293407\"><a href=\"/opinion/2293407/wilson-v-wal-mart-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392.) Included among the costs\npermitted under section 1033.5, subdivision (a) are attorney fees that are authorized by\ncontract. (§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).)\n       In this case, there has, to date, been no award of a defined amount of attorney fees\nin favor of JMR. Pursuant to the court’s November 13, 2012 order, it granted EAR’s\nmotion to strike certain costs listed in JMR’s costs memorandum. As a result, the total\namount of costs awarded pursuant to JMR’s costs memorandum (excluding expert\nwitness fees) was $4,800.18. Adding these costs to the judgment, the total judgment to\ndate is $320,431.18, nearly $55,000 less than the pretrial offers. It is apparent that the\ncourt—given the sizable amount of attorney fees claimed by JMR in its motion for fees\nunder Civil Code section 1717 ($252,889)—assumed JMR would ultimately receive an\nattorney fee award that would bring JMR’s total recovery above the pretrial offer\nthreshold of $375,000. But, as we have discussed (see section III, ante), the November\n13, 2012 order regarding attorney fees is an interim, nonappealable order that\ncontemplates further action (i.e., determining the amount of the award) by the court.\nAccordingly, any finding that JMR is entitled, in the court’s discretion, to an award of\nexpert fees pursuant to section 998, subdivision (d) is premature. We will therefore\nreverse the court’s order of November 13, 2012, awarding JMR expert fees pursuant to\n                                              56\n\fsection 998 and will remand the case to the trial court. Such reversal is without prejudice\nto the court, upon rendering an attorney fee award, to make a discretionary determination\nas to whether JMR is entitled to an award of postoffer expert witness fees under section\n998.\n       V.     EAR’s Motion for New Trial\n       As its final claim of error, EAR contends the court abused its discretion in denying\nits motion for new trial. It argues the court’s alleged failure to read JMR’s proposed\nstatement of decision before signing it constituted “an ‘irregularity in the proceedings’ ”\nthat compelled the granting of the new trial motion. This contention is without merit.\n       After entry of judgment, EAR filed a motion for new trial, asserting six of the\nseven statutory grounds provided under section 657, including “irregularity in the\nproceedings of the court” as provided in subdivision (1) of the statute. The bulk of\nEAR’s argument below was that (1) JMR concealed and suppressed evidence, thereby\ndenying EAR a fair trial, and (2) there was insufficient evidence supporting the finding of\nEAR’s responsibility for delay and for the award of damages (including Eichleay\ndamages and damages related to supplying the air compressor). Although EAR made\nreference to the statement of decision in its motion—challenging both its timeliness and\nits contents—it did not include as a basis for granting new trial the allegation that the\nstatement of decision had been signed by the court without reading it. By failing to raise\nthe issue below in its motion for new trial, EAR forfeited its appellate challenge to the\ndenial of the motion on this basis. (North Coast Business Park v. Nielsen Construction\nCo. (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256892\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256892/north-coast-business-park-v-nielsen-constr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28 [failure to preserve issue below result in forfeiture of\nappellate claim].)\n       Moreover, even if we were to address EAR’s argument on the merits, it would fail.\nEAR twice states in its opening brief that the trial court “failed to read” the proposed\nstatement of decision before signing it. It presents no evidence in support of this bald\nassertion. (See § 658 [new trial motion based upon irregularity of the proceedings “must\n                                             57\n\fbe made upon affidavits”]; Linhart v.

There is thus no basis for EAR’s contention\nthat the court abused its discretion in denying the motion for new trial. (See Plancarte v.\nGuardsmark, LLC (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2299390\"><a href=\"/opinion/2299390/plancarte-v-guardsmark-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645 [“trial court’s broad discretion in\nruling on a motion for new trial is accorded great deference on appeal”].)\n       VI.    Remaining Arguments by SureTec\n       SureTec asserts three further arguments. Its first two arguments are that (1) if the\njudgment is reversed as to SureTec, it is entitled to its attorney fees for its successful\ndefense of the lawsuit, including the attorney fees incurred on appeal; and (2) if the\njudgment against EAR is reversed, the judgment against SureTec must likewise be\nreversed. Since we affirm the judgment, neither of these arguments has merit.\n       As its third remaining argument, SureTec argues that, assuming the judgment is\nnot reversed, its maximum liability for damages, including costs and attorney fees, is\n$471,881, the amount of the performance bond issued on EAR’s plumbing subcontract.\nIt contends that because the court, despite SureTec’s request, did not allocate the damage\naward as between the two subcontracts, there can be no inference drawn that some\namount of the $315,631 damages was awarded for EAR’s breach of the electrical\nsubcontract. Accordingly, SureTec argues, its responsibility to answer for its principal,\nEAR, is limited to the $471,881 amount of the performance bond for the plumbing\nsubcontract. It seeks an order from this court to this effect.\n       As discussed in section IV, ante, the total amount of JMR’s recovery to date,\nincluding costs properly awarded by the court, is $320,431.18. This is approximately\n$150,000 less than the amount of the performance bond for the plumbing subcontract.\nThe trial court has not yet made a final ruling regarding attorney fees, and any issue\nconcerning JMR’s claimed entitlement to expert fees under section 998 will be decided\nby the trial court in its discretion upon remand. Thus, at this point there is no justiciable\n                                              58\n\fissue for resolution by this court, and we decline to decide hypothetical or theoretical\ncontroversies.
