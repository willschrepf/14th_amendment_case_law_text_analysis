BACKGROUND\r                                   II.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  instant  case  stems   from  a  dispute  over  the\r\n\ncircumstances under which a Quadrennial Assembly (the \"Assembly\")\r\n\nof  the  AEELA  was  held  on  July  8,  1995.    The  AEELA  has\r\n\napproximately 180,000 members, all of whom are  regular or former\r\n\nemployees  of the government of  Puerto Rico.   Of these members,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1    These \"matters\"  included the  following:  1) the  AEELA was\r\ncreated as a quasi-public entity to provide financial services to\r\ngovernment employees, which is a traditional government function;\r                                                                 \r\n2)  membership in the  AEELA is  mandatory for  most Commonwealth\r\nemployees  as is  the 3%  payroll deduction  to fund  the AEELA's\r\noperations; 3) the AEELA's  operations and delegate elections are\r\nheavily  regulated  by  statute  (e.g.,  number  of  members  per\r\ndelegate);  4)  heads  of  government   departments  appoint  the\r\nElection Committee to run the delegate elections; 5) the Board of\r\nDirectors  and  the  Election  committee members  often  work  on\r\ngovernment time, and use  government facilities and equipment; 6)\r\nthe  AEELA's  finances  are  supervised  by  the   Commonwealth's\r\nComptroller; 7) the AEELA  is exempt from state taxation;  8) the\r\nCommonwealth collects  the 3%  membership  fee for  the AEELA  by\r\nmaking payroll deductions; 9) the AEELA may make investments only\r\n\"on advice\" from the  Commonwealth's Treasury Department; 10) the\r\nAEELA's  employees participate  in the  Commonwealth government's\r\npension  plan; 11) the Commonwealth provides  the AEELA with some\r\nservices  free of charge; and 12) the AEELA's members, delegates,\r\nand directors are all government employees.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n75%  are required by law to participate  in and be members of the\r\n\nAEELA,  and are  required to  provide 3%  of their  salary  to be\r\n\nadministered by the AEELA.  Only employees of public corporations\r\n\nand municipalities may participate in the AEELA.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs contend,  and this court  must assume, given\r\n\nour  procedural posture,  that Defendants have  exercised control\r\n\nover  the AEELA  since 1987,  and used  this control  to handpick\r\n\ndelegates  to the Assembly in question in order to maintain their\r\n\ncontrol, and that  of the Popular Democratic  Party (\"PDP\"), over\r\n\nthe AEELA.   We must further infer  that Defendants impermissibly\r\n\nnotified only those delegates  who shared their political beliefs\r\n\nthat  the Assembly  would  be  held,  and  refused  to  take  the\r\n\nnecessary  measures  to  notify  or  confirm  the  membership  of\r\n\ndelegates who do not support the PDP.  Furthermore, we infer that\r\n\nDefendants  denied  Plaintiff-Appellant  Nieves  a  list  of  the\r\n\ncertified delegates,  thus hindering her candidacy  for President\r\n\nof the AEELA's Board of Directors.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs charge that these actions amount  to illegal\r\n\npolitical discrimination  in violation of their  rights under the\r\n\nDue Process Clause  of the Fourteenth Amendment  and the enabling\r\n\nlaw  of  the Commonwealth  Employees  Association,  3 L.P.R.A.   \r\n\n862(b).   They  also  contend, contrary  to  the  district  court\r\n\nopinion dismissing their claim  under 28 U.S.C.   1983,  that the\r\n\nacts of Defendants are state action.\r\n\n                         III.  DISCUSSION\r                                   III.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          \"Title  42   U.S.C.     1983  provides   a  remedy  for\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ndeprivations of rights  secured by the  Constitution and laws  of\r\n\nthe United States when that  deprivation takes place 'under color\r\n\nof  any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom,  or usage, of any\r\n\nState or Territory . .  . .'\"  Rockwell, 26 F.3d  at 256 (quoting\r                                                 \r\n\nLugar v.

We note  in passing that at  least two courts\r\n\nhave  already  concluded  that  the  AEELA  is   not  an  agency,\r\n\ndepartment or  instrumentality of the Government  of Puerto Rico,\r\n\nsuggesting  that  the AEELA's  actions and  those of  its members\r\n\ncannot  be labeled state action.

Direct State Action\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  contend  that  Defendants' actions  may  be\r\n\nfairly  attributed to the state because, they claim, the AEELA is\r\n\na  public  corporation  and  therefore, an  \"arm  of  the state.\"\r\n\nAlthough \"[t]he Act which creates the Association does not define\r\n\nwhether  it is an agency,  a department, an  instrumentality or a\r\n\npublic corporation,\" V squez-P rez, slip  op. at 24, both federal\r                                            \r\n\nand state courts have held  that the AEELA is not  a governmental\r\n\nagency,  see Morales,  slip op.  at 2  (noting that  \"the Supreme\r                              \r\n\nCourt of Puerto Rico has, since 1932, consistently ruled that the\r\n\nEmployees Association is not a part of the Government\"); V squez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nP rez, slip op. at 26.\r               \r\n\n          Admittedly, technical  labels are not dispositive.   In\r\n\nLebr n v. National R.R. Passenger Corp.,     U.S.    , 115 S. Ct.\r                                                 \r\n\n961 (1995), the Supreme  Court addressed direct state  action and\r\n\ntechnical labels, ruling that,  despite a statutory disclaimer of\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nagency status,  the National Railroad Passenger  Corp. (\"Amtrak\")\r\n\nwas nonetheless a government entity.  In deciding that Amtrak was\r\n\na  state actor when  it refused to lease  advertising space to an\r\n\nartist's  display because  it was  \"political,\" the  Court stated\r\n\nthat \"it is  not for Congress to make the  final determination of\r\n\nAmtrak's  status   as  a   government  entity  for   purposes  of\r\n\ndetermining the constitutional rights of citizens affected by its\r\n\nactions.\"  Id. at 971.   The Court, in dicta, indicated  that the\r                        \r\n\nissue of state action and technical labels that it was addressing\r\n\nalso had relevance to the states, stating that \"it cannot be that\r\n\ngovernment,  state or federal, is  able to evade  the most solemn\r\n\nobligations imposed  in the  Constitution by simply  resorting to\r\n\nthe  corporate form [since] [o]n  that thesis, Plessy v. Ferguson\r                                                                           \r\n\ncan  be resurrected by  the simple device of  having the State of\r\n\nLouisiana  operate   segregated  trains  through   a  state-owned\r\n\nAmtrak.\"  Id. at 972 (citations omitted).\r                       \r\n\n          While  the logic of Lebr n applies to the present case,\r                                              \r\n\nwe conclude  that it does not  avail Plaintiffs.   The Court held\r\n\nthat where\r\n\n            the Government creates  a corporation  by\r\n            special  law,  for  the   furtherance  of\r\n            governmental objectives,  and retains for\r\n            itself permanent authority  to appoint  a\r\n            majority   of   the  directors   of  that\r\n            corporation, the corporation  is part  of\r\n            the Government for purposes of  the First\r\n            Amendment.\r\n\nId. at 974-75.  The Supreme Court in Lebr n focused on the degree\r                                                     \r\n\nof  control  that the  federal government  had  over Amtrak.   In\r\n\ncontrast, neither party  in the instant  case has contended  that\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthe Government  of Puerto  Rico has retained  permanent authority\r\n\nover  the  directors of  the  AEELA.   This  distinction  becomes\r\n\nclearer  when we  compare  the facts  surrounding Amtrak  and the\r\n\nAEELA.     The  President  appoints  the   majority  of  Amtrak's\r\n\ndirectors,  the federal  government owns  all of  Amtrak's voting\r\n\nstock, and the government subsidizes Amtrak's \"perennial losses.\"\r\n\nId. at 967.  By contrast, the government of Puerto  Rico does not\r             \r\n\nretain the  power  to  appoint  any  of  the  AEELA's  directors.\r\n\nInstead, the  directors are  elected by delegates  who themselves\r\n\nare elected by the AEELA's membership at large.  Furthermore, the\r\n\nAEELA's  losses, if  any,  are not  regularly  subsidized by  the\r\n\ngovernment of  Puerto  Rico.   As  a result  of  these facts,  we\r\n\nconclude that the AEELA  does not constitute an extension  of the\r\n\ngovernment of Puerto Rico,  and so Defendants must be  treated as\r\n\nprivate parties.   Thus, direct  state action is  not present  in\r\n\nthis case.\r\n\n                    B.  Indirect State Action\r                              B.  Indirect State Action\r\n\n          We  therefore  turn  to  the question  of  whether  the\r\n\nconduct at issue, while not that of the government of Puerto Rico\r\n\ndirectly, may be nonetheless  fairly attributed to the state.   A\r\n\nprivate entity's conduct is not actionable under section  1983 if\r\n\nthe challenged action results from the exercise of private choice\r\n\nand  not  from  state influence  or  coercion.

As this  court has  previously spelled  out, the\r\n\nrelevant inquiries consist of whether there was\r\n\n            (1) .  .  .  an  elaborate  financial  or\r\n            regulatory nexus between [Defendants] and\r\n            the  government  of  Puerto   Rico  which\r\n            compelled  [Defendants]  to  act as  they\r\n            did, (2) an assumption by [Defendants] of\r\n            a  traditional public function,  or (3) a\r\n            symbiotic   relationship   involving  the\r\n            sharing of profits.\r\n\nRodr guez-Garc a, 904 F.2d at 96; see Ponce, 760 F.2d at 377.

Nexus Analysis\r                                  1.  Nexus Analysis\r\n\n          As both parties acknowledge, \"the challenged  action of\r\n\nthe  regulated entity . . . may be  fairly treated as that of the\r\n\nState itself .  . . only  when it can be  said that the  State is\r\n\nresponsible  for  the specific  conduct  of  which the  plaintiff\r\n\ncomplains.\"  Blum v.

The test is  whether the\r                             \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ngovernment exercised coercive power  or provided such significant\r\n\nencouragement  that the complained-of  misconduct surrounding the\r\n\nAssembly and the Board elections must be deemed to be the conduct\r\n\nof the government.  Id., 904 F.2d at 90.\r                                 \r\n\n          We  emphasize  that  our  examination  focuses  on  the\r\n\ngovernment's  connection  to the  complained-of  action, not  the\r\n\ngovernment's  connection to the AEELA itself.  See Blum, 457 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 1004.  As  a result, we find extraneous  Plaintiffs' arguments\r\n\nhighlighting  the facts that the  AEELA was created  by law, that\r\n\nits members  and Directors  are  public employees,  and that  the\r\n\nelective process is regulated  by law, except to the  degree that\r\n\nthese facts  demonstrate government coercion  or encouragement of\r\n\nthe complained-of conduct.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  contend  that   Defendants  derived   their\r\n\nauthority  to schedule  the Assembly  and election from  a Puerto\r\n\nRico  law,  3  L.P.R.A.     862(d),   and  that  Defendants  were\r\n\ngovernment employees who  performed their  duties during  working\r\n\ntime  and using  government  equipment and  materials.   However,\r\n\nPlaintiffs have  hung their claim on the  proposition that state-\r\n\ngranted authority suffices to find  state action, since they have\r\n\nfailed to  allege that the  government coerced or  encouraged the\r\n\nspecific election rigging that gives rise to their complaint.  We\r\n\nbelieve that the state's grant of authority  alone cannot justify\r\n\na conclusion of state action in this case.\r\n\n          We  draw  this  conclusion  by  comparing  two  of  our\r\n\nprevious cases.  First, like the district court, we are persuaded\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nby  our holding in Rockwell,  26 F.3d at  258, that state-granted\r                                     \r\n\nauthority  making possible  a private  party's actions  does not,\r\n\nwithout more,  sufficiently show  that the specific  action taken\r\n\nunder that authority constitutes state action.  Id.  In Rockwell,\r                                                                          \r\n\nwe  concluded   that  the  fact  that   a  Massachusetts  statute\r\n\nauthorized  public health  professionals  to hospitalize  persons\r\n\nbelieved to present  a likelihood  of serious harm  by reason  of\r\n\nmental illness,  did  not suffice  to  create a  sufficient  link\r\n\nbetween the state  and the plaintiff's own  detention to classify\r\n\nthe hospital as a state actor.  Id. By contrast,  in Rodr ques v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nFurtado,  950  F.2d 805,  814  (1st Cir.  1991), we  held  that a\r                 \r\n\nphysician \"functioned as a state actor\" where he performed a body\r\n\ncavity search of the  plaintiff pursuant to a search warrant.  We\r\n\njustified  our  conclusion  on  the  ground  that the  scope  and\r\n\nmotivation  for the  specific conduct  occasioning the  complaint\r\n\n\"were established  solely by the state's  investigatory goals and\r\n\njustified solely by the search warrant.\"  Id. at 814.\r                                                       \r\n\n          We  conclude  that  to  the  extent that  state-granted\r\n\nauthority can  justify a finding of state  action, that authority\r\n\nmust be connected  to the  aim of encouraging  or compelling  the\r\n\nspecific  complained-of conduct.   Because  we conclude  that the\r\n\ndistrict court correctly found  that no state-linked financial or\r\n\nregulatory nexus compelled Defendants to act as they did, we find\r\n\nno state action under the nexus test.\r\n\n            2.  Traditional Public Function Analysis  \r                      2.  Traditional Public Function Analysis\r\n\n          \"[F]or a private actor to be deemed to have acted under\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ncolor of state  law, it is  not enough to  show that the  private\r\n\nactor  performed a public function.\"   Rockwell, 26  F.3d at 258.\r                                                         \r\n\nRather,  \"[t]he  plaintiff  must  show that  the  private  entity\r\n\nassumed  powers  'traditionally   exclusively  reserved  to   the\r\n\nState.'\"   Id.  (quoting  Rodr ques,  950  F.2d  at  813).    The\r                                             \r\n\nexclusive  function test  screens for  situations \"where  a state\r\n\ntries  to  escape  its  responsibilities by  delegating  them  to\r\n\nprivate  parties.\"  Id. at 258; see Johnson v.

If  the convening  of the\r\n\nAEELA's assembly or  the election of  its board are  traditional,\r\n\nexclusively sovereign functions which have merely  been delegated\r\n\nto private  actors, then  the state cannot  escape responsibility\r\n\nfor  constitutional deprivations caused by private parties acting\r\n\npursuant to the delegation.  Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 258.\r                                               \r\n\n          In Rendell-Baker,  457 U.S.  at 352, the  Supreme Court\r                                    \r\n\ndiscussed the \"public  function\" analysis of  state action.   The\r\n\nCourt concluded  that although the education  of maladjusted high\r\n\nschool  students is a public function for which the state intends\r\n\nto provide  services at public expense,  that \"legislative policy\r\n\nchoice in no way  makes these services the exclusive  province of\r\n\nthe State . . . . That a private entity performs a function which\r\n\nserves the public  does not makes its  acts state action.\"   Id.;\r                                                                          \r\n\nsee also Ponce, 760 F.2d at 381.\r                        \r\n\n          Plaintiffs contend  that for public  interest purposes,\r\n\nthe  government of  Puerto Rico  has delegated  to the  AEELA the\r\n\ntraditional  activity  of  promoting  savings   among  government\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nemployees, and  providing them benefits such  as loans, insurance\r\n\nand medical  services.  We  agree with Plaintiffs  that providing\r\n\nsuch  benefits  to public  employees  probably  does promote  the\r\n\npublic interest.   However,  these services cannot  reasonably be\r\n\ncharacterized  as  the exclusive  province  of  the State,  since\r\n\nbanks, credit unions,  savings and loans  associations, brokerage\r\n\nfirms, mutual funds, and  insurance companies traditionally  have\r\n\nexisted to promote savings, loans and health and other insurance.\r\n\nAs a result, we conclude that Defendants cannot be found  to have\r\n\nengaged in  state action under the  \"traditional public function\"\r\n\ntest. \r\n\n                   3.  Symbiotic Relationship  \r                             3.  Symbiotic Relationship  \r\n\n          State  action  can be  found  by  way  of  a  symbiotic\r\n\nrelationship.   Under  this test,  a  private party's  acts  \"are\r\n\nattributable  to the  state only  if the  government 'has  so far\r\n\ninsinuated itself  into a  position of interdependence  with [the\r\n\nprivate entity] that it must be recognized as a joint participant\r\n\nin the  challenged activity .  . . .'\"   Ponce,  760 F.2d at  381\r                                                        \r\n\n(quoting Burton v.

While \"one of the key factors in determining  whether a\r\n\nsymbiotic  relationship  exists  is certainly  whether  the state\r\n\nshared  in any profits made,\" the lack of a financial partnership\r\n\nis not  necessarily dispositive.

Burton, 365 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n723-24.  In contrast, there is no evidence that the government of\r\n\nPuerto Rico  somehow profited from  the allegedly  discriminatory\r\n\nactions of  Defendants.  Even  though the AEELA  receives legally\r\n\nmandated funds from public employees, no contention has been made\r\n\nthat  this money  becomes  the  property  of  the  AEELA  or  the\r\n\ngovernment.   In fact,  Plaintiffs have  not disputed  that, upon\r\n\ntermination of employment,  public employees  receive back  their\r\n\nfunds.   While  the Puerto  Rico Secretary  of the  Treasury does\r\n\napprove  the investments  made  by the  AEELA  with these  funds,\r\n\nPlaintiffs  have not contended that  these funds are somehow used\r\n\nto  the benefit  of the  government of  Puerto Rico,  rather than\r\n\ninvested at a market  rate of return.  Also,  Plaintiffs have not\r\n\neven  attempted  to link  the  alleged election  rigging  to some\r\n\nfinancial gain to the government of Puerto Rico, in  the way that\r\n\nthe discrimination  in Burton was  linked to the  state's returns\r                                       \r\n\nfrom the venture.  Thus, whatever financial success the AEELA may\r\n\nachieve is not shared with the government of Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          Similarly, while  the lack  of financial enrichment  is\r\n\nnot dispositive, and  \"[t]he test is  one of interdependence  and\r\n\njoint  participation,\"  we agree  with  the  district court  that\r\n\nPlaintiffs have  failed to contest the proposition that the AEELA\r\n\nis essentially independent in  the conduct of its  daily affairs.\r\n\nAnd no  attempt has been  made to link  the government of  Puerto\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nRico to the  decisions of when  to hold the  Assembly and how  to\r\n\nconduct  Board elections.    As a  result,  we conclude  that  no\r\n\nsymbiotic relationship exists  between the  government of  Puerto\r\n\nRico and the AEELA.\r\n\n          In  passing,  we  observe  that in  the  instant  case,\r\n\nPlaintiffs  have not  premised their  claim on a  private party's\r\n\nspecific act, directed  by the government  of Puerto Rico,  which\r\n\nsomehow benefits the government via a symbiotic relationship with\r\n\nthe private actor.   This point can be illustrated  by comparison\r\n\nwith  the symbiotic relationship that  led to a  finding of state\r\n\naction in Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 565 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp.  963, 974,  stay denied,  572 F.  Supp. 957  (D.P.R. 1983),\r                                       \r\n\nvacated  on other grounds Romany v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto\r                                                                           \r\n\nRico,  742 F.2d  32 (1st  Cir. 1984)  (holding that  the district\r              \r\n\ncourt should have abstained from reaching the merits of the First\r\n\nAmendment claims until  the Puerto Rico  Supreme Court decided  a\r\n\npending controversy).  In  Schneider, the plaintiffs charged that\r                                              \r\n\nPuerto  Rico laws  forcing them  to be  members of  Puerto Rico's\r\n\nintegrated bar  association violated their rights  to free speech\r\n\nand  free association, since those laws forced them to belong to,\r\n\nand  financially  support,  an organization  (the  Colegio) which\r\n\npromoted  ideological  and  political causes  contrary  to  their\r\n\npersonal beliefs.  Id. at 965-66.  The court found state  action,\r                                \r\n\nnoting  not  only  that Puerto  Rico  law  required  attorneys to\r\n\nmaintain  membership in  the Colegio,  but also  emphasizing that\r\n\nrequired  membership  aided  the  Colegio's  public  function  of\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nregulating  lawyers,  from  which  the government  was  found  to\r\n\nbenefit.  Id. at  973-74.  Essentially, the government  of Puerto\r                       \r\n\nRico was found to be advantaged  by the specific act on which the\r\n\ncomplaint was grounded, namely, forced membership in the Colegio.\r\n\n          By  contrast, plaintiffs  in  the instant  case do  not\r\n\nmount a  facial challenge to  the laws that  create the  AEELA or\r\n\nrequire that it  hold elections.   Instead, they  argue that  the\r\n\nAEELA's    leadership    committed    discretionary    acts    of\r\n\ndiscrimination, and did so  while exercising authority granted by\r\n\nthe  government of  Puerto Rico.   But  plaintiffs fall  short of\r\n\nSchneider in at least two ways.  First, the conduct they complain\r                   \r\n\nof --  discrimination -- is  not specifically mandated  by Puerto\r\n\nRico law, as forced  membership in the Colegio was for lawyers in\r\n\nSchneider.  Unlike the plaintiffs in Schneider, Plaintiffs do not\r                                                        \r\n\nchallenge conduct  specifically directed by Puerto  Rico law; for\r\n\nexample, their forced membership in the  AEELA or the requirement\r\n\nthat  the   AEELA  hold  assemblies  and   elections.    Instead,\r\n\nPlaintiffs complain of the  manner in which the assembly  and the\r                                            \r\n\nelections  were held -- this  manner is not  directed by statute.\r                                              \r\n\nSecond, Plaintiffs  have failed  to link  these specific  acts of\r\n\ndiscrimination in  the holding of AEELA's  assembly and elections\r\n\nto  any symbiotic  relationship by  which the  government profits\r\n\nfrom these specific discriminatory acts.  No  allegation has been\r\n\nmade  that the government of Puerto Rico is somehow advantaged by\r\n\nthe  alleged  misconduct in  AEELA's assembly  or elections.   By\r\n\ncontrast, in  Schneider, bar  membership required by  Puerto Rico\r                                 \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nlaw constituted  the conduct complained of, and  also was alleged\r\n\nto  benefit  the  government  of Puerto  Rico,  since  compulsory\r\n\nmembership made possible the  Colegio's regulatory functions.  As\r\n\na  result of these distinctions,  we conclude that Schneider does\r                                                                      \r\n\nnot avail Plaintiffs.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          To maintain a Section 1983 action, state action must be\r\n\npresent.   Because we conclude that, reading the pleadings in the\r\n\nbest light for  Plaintiffs, they can  prove no set of  facts that\r\n\nwould implicate state action, the judgment of the district  court\r\n\nis\r\n\naffirmed.\r          affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n",

See Br. for Appellants at 12.   The answer to this argument, of course, is clear:  even considering this Rule 56 material, see supra note 1, we conclude that plaintiffs demonstrated no genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case stems from a dispute over the circumstances under which a Quadrennial Assembly (the \"Assembly\") of the AEELA was held on July 8, 1995.   The AEELA has approximately 180,000 members, all of whom are regular or former employees of the government of Puerto Rico.   Of these members, 75% are required by law to participate in and be members of the AEELA, and are required to provide 3% of their salary to be administered by the AEELA.   Only employees of public corporations and municipalities may participate in the AEELA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend, and this court must assume, given our procedural posture, that Defendants have exercised control over the AEELA since 1987, and used this control to handpick delegates to the Assembly in question in order to maintain their control, and that of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"), over the AEELA.   We must further infer that Defendants impermissibly notified only those delegates who shared their political beliefs that the Assembly would be held, and refused to take the necessary measures to notify or confirm the membership of delegates who do not support the PDP.   Furthermore, we infer that Defendants denied Plaintiff-Appellant Nieves a list of the certified delegates, thus hindering her candidacy for President of the AEELA's Board of Directors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs charge that these actions amount to illegal political discrimination in violation of their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the enabling law of the Commonwealth Employees Association, 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 862(b).   They also contend, contrary to the district court opinion dismissing their claim under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, that the acts of Defendants are state action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Title 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 provides a remedy for deprivations of rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States when that deprivation takes place 'under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory....' \"  Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 256 (quoting Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 924, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2746-47, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982)).   To state a claim under &#167; 1983, a plaintiff must make two showings:  the existence of a federal or statutory right;  and a deprivation of that right by a person acting under color of state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See id.;  Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court addressed only the second showing, dismissing this action on the ground that Defendants did not act under color of state law when they scheduled the general assembly for July 8, 1995.   We note in passing that at least two courts have already concluded that the AEELA is not an agency, department or instrumentality of the Government of Puerto Rico, suggesting that the AEELA's actions and those of its members cannot be labeled state action.   Morales v. Chaves, No. 75-1087, slip op. at 2 (D.P.R. Dec. 9, 1975) (noting that while \"[i]t is true that the Association was created by statute and only government employees may be members ... there all relation with the Commonwealth ceases\");  Association of Employees of Puerto Rico v. Vasquez- Perez, 92 JTS 52, slip op. at 26 (P.R.1992) (official trans.)  (stating, in the context of deciding whether the AEELA was subject to the Truth in Lending Act, that \"although the Association is a highly regulated entity created by the government, whose objective is to implement the government policy of ... encouraging saving among public employees ... it cannot be considered as a government agency, department, instrumentality or public corporation\").   While persuasive as to certain points, these cases do not represent binding authority for this court.   As a result, like the district court before us, we conduct our own inquiry into the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because section 1983 does not reach private actions, the key issue before us is whether the conduct at issue in this case may be \" 'fairly attributable to the State,' \" Rodriguez-Garcia v. Davila, 904 F.2d 90, 94 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting Lugar, 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. at 2753-54);  see Ponce v. Basketball Fed'n of Puerto Rico, 760 F.2d 375, 377 (1st Cir.1985).   The state action inquiry is \" 'necessarily fact-bound.' \"  Id. (quoting Lugar, 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. at 2753-54).  \"In cases under &#167; 1983, 'under color' of law has consistently been treated as the same thing as the 'state action' required under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 838, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 2769-70, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982).  \"The ultimate issue in determining whether a person is subject to suit under &#167; 1983 is the same question posed in cases arising under the Fourteenth Amendment:  is the alleged infringement of federal rights 'fairly attributable to the State?' \"  Id. (quoting Lugar, 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. at 2753-54).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that the AEELA is an extension of the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and that the conduct at issue may be fairly attributed to the state on that basis as direct state action.   Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue that even if the AEELA is a private organization, the actions that give rise to the instant case may still be fairly attributed to the state as indirect state action.   Ultimately, a finding of either direct or indirect state action would suffice to sustain Plaintiffs' section 1983 action.   See Rodriguez-Garcia, 904 F.2d at 95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Direct State Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that Defendants' actions may be fairly attributed to the state because, they claim, the AEELA is a public corporation and therefore, an \"arm of the state.\"   Although \"[t]he Act which creates the Association does not define whether it is an agency, a department, an instrumentality or a public corporation,\" Vasquez-Perez, slip op. at 24, both federal and state courts have held that the AEELA is not a governmental agency, see Morales, slip op. at 2 (noting that \"the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has, since 1932, consistently ruled that the Employees Association is not a part of the Government\");  Vasquez-Perez, slip op. at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, technical labels are not dispositive.   In Lebron v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995), the Supreme Court addressed direct state action and technical labels, ruling that, despite a statutory disclaimer of agency status, the National Railroad Passenger Corp.  (\"Amtrak\") was nonetheless a government entity.   In deciding that Amtrak was a state actor when it refused to lease advertising space to an artist's display because it was \"political,\" the Court stated that \"it is not for Congress to make the final determination of Amtrak's status as a government entity for purposes of determining the constitutional rights of citizens affected by its actions.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 971.   The Court, in dicta, indicated that the issue of state action and technical labels that it was addressing also had relevance to the states, stating that \"it cannot be that government, state or federal, is able to evade the most solemn obligations imposed in the Constitution by simply resorting to the corporate form [since] [o]n that thesis, Plessy v. Ferguson [163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896)] can be resurrected by the simple device of having the State of Louisiana operate segregated trains through a state-owned Amtrak.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 972 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the logic of Lebron applies to the present case, we conclude that it does not avail Plaintiffs.   The Court held that where</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>the Government creates a corporation by special law, for the furtherance of governmental objectives, and retains for itself permanent authority to appoint a majority of the directors of that corporation, the corporation is part of the Government for purposes of the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 974-75.   The Supreme Court in Lebron focused on the degree of control that the federal government had over Amtrak.   In contrast, neither party in the instant case has contended that the Government of Puerto Rico has retained permanent authority over the directors of the AEELA.   This distinction becomes clearer when we compare the facts surrounding Amtrak and the AEELA.   The President appoints the majority of Amtrak's directors, the federal government owns all of Amtrak's voting stock, and the government subsidizes Amtrak's \"perennial losses.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 967.   By contrast, the government of Puerto Rico does not retain the power to appoint any of the AEELA's directors.   Instead, the directors are elected by delegates who themselves are elected by the AEELA's membership at large.   Furthermore, the AEELA's losses, if any, are not regularly subsidized by the government of Puerto Rico.  As a result of these facts, we conclude that the AEELA does not constitute an extension of the government of Puerto Rico, and so Defendants must be treated as private parties.   Thus, direct state action is not present in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Indirect State Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore turn to the question of whether the conduct at issue, while not that of the government of Puerto Rico directly, may be nonetheless fairly attributed to the state.   A private entity's conduct is not actionable under section 1983 if the challenged action results from the exercise of private choice and not from state influence or coercion.   See id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 980 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (concluding that Lebron did not involve direct state action, and therefore, unlike the majority, inquiring as to indirect state action);  San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U.S. 522, 547, 107 S.Ct. 2971, 2986, 97 L.Ed.2d 427 (1987) (stating that \"[t]here is no evidence that the Federal Government coerced or encouraged the USOC in the exercise of its right [to deny use of its copyright]\");  Rendell-Baker, 457 U.S. at 841, 102 S.Ct. at 2771 (holding that discharge decisions of largely publicly-funded private school for troubled students were not subject to constitutional challenge because those actions \"were not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, this court must determine whether the conduct of Defendants, as private parties, rises to the level of state action.   As this court has previously spelled out, the relevant inquiries consist of whether there was(1) ... an elaborate financial or regulatory nexus between [Defendants] and the government of Puerto Rico which compelled [Defendants] to act as they did, (2) an assumption by [Defendants] of a traditional public function, or (3) a symbiotic relationship involving the sharing of profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez-Garcia, 904 F.2d at 96;  see Ponce, 760 F.2d at 377.   We examine each test in turn, as satisfaction of any one of the three tests requires that we find indirect state action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Nexus Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As both parties acknowledge, \"the challenged action of the regulated entity ... may be fairly treated as that of the State itself ... only when it can be said that the State is responsible for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.\"  Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 2786, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982), cited in Rodriguez-Garcia, 904 F.2d at 97.   The test is whether the government exercised coercive power or provided such significant encouragement that the complained-of misconduct surrounding the Assembly and the Board elections must be deemed to be the conduct of the government.  Id., 904 F.2d at 90.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that our examination focuses on the government's connection to the complained-of action, not the government's connection to the AEELA itself.   See Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004, 102 S.Ct. at 2785-86.   As a result, we find extraneous Plaintiffs' arguments highlighting the facts that the AEELA was created by law, that its members and Directors are public employees, and that the elective process is regulated by law, except to the degree that these facts demonstrate government coercion or encouragement of the complained-of conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that Defendants derived their authority to schedule the Assembly and election from a Puerto Rico law, 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 862(d), and that Defendants were government employees who performed their duties during working time and using government equipment and materials.   However, Plaintiffs have hung their claim on the proposition that state-granted authority suffices to find state action, since they have failed to allege that the government coerced or encouraged the specific election rigging that gives rise to their complaint.   We believe that the state's grant of authority alone cannot justify a conclusion of state action in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We draw this conclusion by comparing two of our previous cases.   First, like the district court, we are persuaded by our holding in Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 258, that state-granted authority making possible a private party's actions does not, without more, sufficiently show that the specific action taken under that authority constitutes state action.  Id.  In Rockwell, we concluded that the fact that a Massachusetts statute authorized public health professionals to hospitalize persons believed to present a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness, did not suffice to create a sufficient link between the state and the plaintiff's own detention to classify the hospital as a state actor.  Id. By contrast, in Rodriques v. Furtado, 950 F.2d 805, 814 (1st Cir.1991), we held that a physician \"functioned as a state actor\" where he performed a body cavity search of the plaintiff pursuant to a search warrant.   We justified our conclusion on the ground that the scope and motivation for the specific conduct occasioning the complaint \"were established solely by the state's investigatory goals and justified solely by the search warrant.\"  Id. at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that to the extent that state-granted authority can justify a finding of state action, that authority must be connected to the aim of encouraging or compelling the specific complained-of conduct.   Because we conclude that the district court correctly found that no state-linked financial or regulatory nexus compelled Defendants to act as they did, we find no state action under the nexus test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Traditional Public Function Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[F]or a private actor to be deemed to have acted under color of state law, it is not enough to show that the private actor performed a public function.\"  Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 258.   Rather, \"[t]he plaintiff must show that the private entity assumed powers 'traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.' \"  Id. (quoting Rodriques, 950 F.2d at 813).   The exclusive function test screens for situations \"where a state tries to escape its responsibilities by delegating them to private parties.\"  Id. at 258;  see Johnson v. Pinkerton Academy, 861 F.2d 335, 338 (1st Cir.1988).   If the convening of the AEELA's assembly or the election of its board are traditional, exclusively sovereign functions which have merely been delegated to private actors, then the state cannot escape responsibility for constitutional deprivations caused by private parties acting pursuant to the delegation.  Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 258.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rendell-Baker, 457 U.S. at 852, 102 S.Ct. at 2777, the Supreme Court discussed the \"public function\" analysis of state action.   The Court concluded that although the education of maladjusted high school students is a public function for which the state intends to provide services at public expense, that \"legislative policy choice in no way makes these services the exclusive province of the State....  That a private entity performs a function which serves the public does not makes its acts state action.\"  Id.;  see also Ponce, 760 F.2d at 381.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that for public interest purposes, the government of Puerto Rico has delegated to the AEELA the traditional activity of promoting savings among government employees, and providing them benefits such as loans, insurance and medical services.   We agree with Plaintiffs that providing such benefits to public employees probably does promote the public interest.   However, these services cannot reasonably be characterized as the exclusive province of the State, since banks, credit unions, savings and loans associations, brokerage firms, mutual funds, and insurance companies traditionally have existed to promote savings, loans and health and other insurance.   As a result, we conclude that Defendants cannot be found to have engaged in state action under the \"traditional public function\" test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Symbiotic Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State action can be found by way of a symbiotic relationship.   Under this test, a private party's acts \"are attributable to the state only if the government 'has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with [the private entity] that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity....' \"  Ponce, 760 F.2d at 381 (quoting Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 725, 81 S.Ct. 856, 861-62, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961)).   While \"one of the key factors in determining whether a symbiotic relationship exists is certainly whether the state shared in any profits made,\" the lack of a financial partnership is not necessarily dispositive.  Rodriguez-Garcia, 904 F.2d at 98-99 (listing several factors relevant to finding \"symbiotic relationship\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Burton, the Court found state action where the state leased public property to a private restaurant owner, who maintained a racially discriminatory policy, acknowledged to be indispensable to the success of the venture.  Burton, 365 U.S. at 723-24, 81 S.Ct. at 860-61.   In contrast, there is no evidence that the government of Puerto Rico somehow profited from the allegedly discriminatory actions of Defendants.   Even though the AEELA receives legally mandated funds from public employees, no contention has been made that this money becomes the property of the AEELA or the government.   In fact, Plaintiffs have not disputed that, upon termination of employment, public employees receive back their funds.   While the Puerto Rico Secretary of the Treasury does approve the investments made by the AEELA with these funds, Plaintiffs have not contended that these funds are somehow used to the benefit of the government of Puerto Rico, rather than invested at a market rate of return.   Also, Plaintiffs have not even attempted to link the alleged election rigging to some financial gain to the government of Puerto Rico, in the way that the discrimination in Burton was linked to the state's returns from the venture.   Thus, whatever financial success the AEELA may achieve is not shared with the government of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, while the lack of financial enrichment is not dispositive, and \"[t]he test is one of interdependence and joint participation,\" we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs have failed to contest the proposition that the AEELA is essentially independent in the conduct of its daily affairs.   And no attempt has been made to link the government of Puerto Rico to the decisions of when to hold the Assembly and how to conduct Board elections.   As a result, we conclude that no symbiotic relationship exists between the government of Puerto Rico and the AEELA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In passing, we observe that in the instant case, Plaintiffs have not premised their claim on a private party's specific act, directed by the government of Puerto Rico, which somehow benefits the government via a symbiotic relationship with the private actor.   This point can be illustrated by comparison with the symbiotic relationship that led to a finding of state action in Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 565 F.Supp. 963, 974, stay denied, 572 F.Supp. 957 (D.P.R.1983), vacated on other grounds Romany v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 742 F.2d 32 (1st Cir.1984) (holding that the district court should have abstained from reaching the merits of the First Amendment claims until the Puerto Rico Supreme Court decided a pending controversy).   In Schneider, the plaintiffs charged that Puerto Rico laws forcing them to be members of Puerto Rico's integrated bar association violated their rights to free speech and free association, since those laws forced them to belong to, and financially support, an organization (the Colegio) which promoted ideological and political causes contrary to their personal beliefs.  Id. at 965-66.   The court found state action, noting not only that Puerto Rico law required attorneys to maintain membership in the Colegio, but also emphasizing that required membership aided the Colegio's public function of regulating lawyers, from which the government was found to benefit.  Id. at 973-74.   Essentially, the government of Puerto Rico was found to be advantaged by the specific act on which the complaint was grounded, namely, forced membership in the Colegio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, plaintiffs in the instant case do not mount a facial challenge to the laws that create the AEELA or require that it hold elections.   Instead, they argue that the AEELA's leadership committed discretionary acts of discrimination, and did so while exercising authority granted by the government of Puerto Rico.   But plaintiffs fall short of Schneider in at least two ways.   First, the conduct they complain of--discrimination--is not specifically mandated by Puerto Rico law, as forced membership in the Colegio was for lawyers in Schneider.   Unlike the plaintiffs in Schneider, Plaintiffs do not challenge conduct specifically directed by Puerto Rico law;  for example, their forced membership in the AEELA or the requirement that the AEELA hold assemblies and elections.   Instead, Plaintiffs complain of the manner in which the assembly and the elections were held--this manner is not directed by statute.   Second, Plaintiffs have failed to link these specific acts of discrimination in the holding of AEELA's assembly and elections to any symbiotic relationship by which the government profits from these specific discriminatory acts.   No allegation has been made that the government of Puerto Rico is somehow advantaged by the alleged misconduct in AEELA's assembly or elections.   By contrast, in Schneider, bar membership required by Puerto Rico law constituted the conduct complained of, and also was alleged to benefit the government of Puerto Rico, since compulsory membership made possible the Colegio's regulatory functions.   As a result of these distinctions, we conclude that Schneider does not avail Plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To maintain a Section 1983 action, state action must be present.   Because we conclude that, reading the pleadings in the best light for Plaintiffs, they can prove no set of facts that would implicate state action, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These \"matters\" included the following:  1) the AEELA was created as a quasi-public entity to provide financial services to government employees, which is a traditional government function;  2) membership in the AEELA is mandatory for most Commonwealth employees as is the 3% payroll deduction to fund the AEELA's operations;  3) the AEELA's operations and delegate elections are heavily regulated by statute (e.g., number of members per delegate);  4) heads of government departments appoint the Election Committee to run the delegate elections;  5) the Board of Directors and the Election committee members often work on government time, and use government facilities and equipment;  6) the AEELA's finances are supervised by the Commonwealth's Comptroller;  7) the AEELA is exempt from state taxation;  8) the Commonwealth collects the 3% membership fee for the AEELA by making payroll deductions;  9) the AEELA may make investments only \"on advice\" from the Commonwealth's Treasury Department;  10) the AEELA's employees participate in the Commonwealth government's pension plan;  11) the Commonwealth provides the AEELA with some services free of charge;  and 12) the AEELA's members, delegates, and directors are all government employees</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> For the purposes of section 1983, \"Puerto Rico enjoys the functional equivalent of statehood,\" and thus the term \"state law\" includes Puerto Rico law.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case stems from a dispute over the circumstances under which a Quadrennial Assembly (the \"Assembly\") of the AEELA was held on July 8, 1995.   The AEELA has approximately 180,000 members, all of whom are regular or former employees of the government of Puerto Rico.   Of these members, 75% are required by law to participate in and be members of the AEELA, and are required to provide 3% of their salary to be administered by the AEELA.   Only employees of public corporations and municipalities may participate in the AEELA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend, and this court must assume, given our procedural posture, that Defendants have exercised control over the AEELA since 1987, and used this control to handpick delegates to the Assembly in question in order to maintain their control, and that of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"), over the AEELA.   We must further infer that Defendants impermissibly notified only those delegates who shared their political beliefs that the Assembly would be held, and refused to take the necessary measures to notify or confirm the membership of delegates who do not support the PDP.   Furthermore, we infer that Defendants denied Plaintiff-Appellant Nieves a list of the certified delegates, thus hindering her candidacy for President of the AEELA's Board of Directors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs charge that these actions amount to illegal political discrimination in violation of their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the enabling law of the Commonwealth Employees Association, 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 862(b).   They also contend, contrary to the district court opinion dismissing their claim under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, that the acts of Defendants are state action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

(\"Amtrak\") was nonetheless a government entity.   In deciding that Amtrak was a state actor when it refused to lease advertising space to an artist's display because it was \"political,\" the Court stated that \"it is not for Congress to make the final determination of Amtrak's status as a government entity for purposes of determining the constitutional rights of citizens affected by its actions.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 971.   The Court, in dicta, indicated that the issue of state action and technical labels that it was addressing also had relevance to the states, stating that \"it cannot be that government, state or federal, is able to evade the most solemn obligations imposed in the Constitution by simply resorting to the corporate form [since] [o]n that thesis, Plessy v.

The Court held that where</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>the Government creates a corporation by special law, for the furtherance of governmental objectives, and retains for itself permanent authority to appoint a majority of the directors of that corporation, the corporation is part of the Government for purposes of the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 974-75.   The Supreme Court in Lebron focused on the degree of control that the federal government had over Amtrak.   In contrast, neither party in the instant case has contended that the Government of Puerto Rico has retained permanent authority over the directors of the AEELA.   This distinction becomes clearer when we compare the facts surrounding Amtrak and the AEELA.   The President appoints the majority of Amtrak's directors, the federal government owns all of Amtrak's voting stock, and the government subsidizes Amtrak's \"perennial losses.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 967.   By contrast, the government of Puerto Rico does not retain the power to appoint any of the AEELA's directors.   Instead, the directors are elected by delegates who themselves are elected by the AEELA's membership at large.   Furthermore, the AEELA's losses, if any, are not regularly subsidized by the government of Puerto Rico.  As a result of these facts, we conclude that the AEELA does not constitute an extension of the government of Puerto Rico, and so Defendants must be treated as private parties.   Thus, direct state action is not present in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Indirect State Action</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore turn to the question of whether the conduct at issue, while not that of the government of Puerto Rico directly, may be nonetheless fairly attributed to the state.   A private entity's conduct is not actionable under section 1983 if the challenged action results from the exercise of private choice and not from state influence or coercion.   See id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 980 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (concluding that Lebron did not involve direct state action, and therefore, unlike the majority, inquiring as to indirect state action);  San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v.

As this court has previously spelled out, the relevant inquiries consist of whether there was(1) ... an elaborate financial or regulatory nexus between [Defendants] and the government of Puerto Rico which compelled [Defendants] to act as they did, (2) an assumption by [Defendants] of a traditional public function, or (3) a symbiotic relationship involving the sharing of profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez-Garcia, 904 F.2d at 96;  see Ponce, 760 F.2d at 377.   We examine each test in turn, as satisfaction of any one of the three tests requires that we find indirect state action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Nexus Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As both parties acknowledge, \"the challenged action of the regulated entity ... may be fairly treated as that of the State itself ... only when it can be said that the State is responsible for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.\"  Blum v. Yaretsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110768\"><a href=\"/opinion/110768/blum-v-yaretsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span>, 1004, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110768\"><a href=\"/opinion/110768/blum-v-yaretsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2777</span></a></span>, 2786, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110768\"><a href=\"/opinion/110768/blum-v-yaretsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span> (1982), cited in Rodriguez-Garcia, 904 F.2d at 97.   The test is whether the government exercised coercive power or provided such significant encouragement that the complained-of misconduct surrounding the Assembly and the Board elections must be deemed to be the conduct of the government.  Id., 904 F.2d at 90.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that our examination focuses on the government's connection to the complained-of action, not the government's connection to the AEELA itself.   See Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004, 102 S.Ct. at 2785-86.   As a result, we find extraneous Plaintiffs' arguments highlighting the facts that the AEELA was created by law, that its members and Directors are public employees, and that the elective process is regulated by law, except to the degree that these facts demonstrate government coercion or encouragement of the complained-of conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that Defendants derived their authority to schedule the Assembly and election from a Puerto Rico law, 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 862(d), and that Defendants were government employees who performed their duties during working time and using government equipment and materials.   However, Plaintiffs have hung their claim on the proposition that state-granted authority suffices to find state action, since they have failed to allege that the government coerced or encouraged the specific election rigging that gives rise to their complaint.   We believe that the state's grant of authority alone cannot justify a conclusion of state action in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We draw this conclusion by comparing two of our previous cases.   First, like the district court, we are persuaded by our holding in Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 258, that state-granted authority making possible a private party's actions does not, without more, sufficiently show that the specific action taken under that authority constitutes state action.  Id.  In Rockwell, we concluded that the fact that a Massachusetts statute authorized public health professionals to hospitalize persons believed to present a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness, did not suffice to create a sufficient link between the state and the plaintiff's own detention to classify the hospital as a state actor.  Id. By contrast, in Rodriques v. Furtado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573067\"><a href=\"/opinion/573067/shirley-mello-rodriques-v-joseph-furtado/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 814 (1st Cir.1991), we held that a physician \"functioned as a state actor\" where he performed a body cavity search of the plaintiff pursuant to a search warrant.   We justified our conclusion on the ground that the scope and motivation for the specific conduct occasioning the complaint \"were established solely by the state's investigatory goals and justified solely by the search warrant.\"  Id. at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that to the extent that state-granted authority can justify a finding of state action, that authority must be connected to the aim of encouraging or compelling the specific complained-of conduct.   Because we conclude that the district court correctly found that no state-linked financial or regulatory nexus compelled Defendants to act as they did, we find no state action under the nexus test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Traditional Public Function Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[F]or a private actor to be deemed to have acted under color of state law, it is not enough to show that the private actor performed a public function.\"  Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 258.   Rather, \"[t]he plaintiff must show that the private entity assumed powers 'traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.' \"  Id. (quoting Rodriques, 950 F.2d at 813).   The exclusive function test screens for situations \"where a state tries to escape its responsibilities by delegating them to private parties.\"  Id. at 258;  see Johnson v. Pinkerton Academy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514213\"><a href=\"/opinion/514213/kenneth-johnson-v-pinkerton-academy-kenneth-johnson-v-pinkerton-academy/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 338 (1st Cir.1988).   If the convening of the AEELA's assembly or the election of its board are traditional, exclusively sovereign functions which have merely been delegated to private actors, then the state cannot escape responsibility for constitutional deprivations caused by private parties acting pursuant to the delegation.  Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 258.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rendell-Baker, 457 U.S. at 852, 102 S.Ct. at 2777, the Supreme Court discussed the \"public function\" analysis of state action.   The Court concluded that although the education of maladjusted high school students is a public function for which the state intends to provide services at public expense, that \"legislative policy choice in no way makes these services the exclusive province of the State....  That a private entity performs a function which serves the public does not makes its acts state action.\"  Id.;  see also Ponce, 760 F.2d at 381.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that for public interest purposes, the government of Puerto Rico has delegated to the AEELA the traditional activity of promoting savings among government employees, and providing them benefits such as loans, insurance and medical services.   We agree with Plaintiffs that providing such benefits to public employees probably does promote the public interest.   However, these services cannot reasonably be characterized as the exclusive province of the State, since banks, credit unions, savings and loans associations, brokerage firms, mutual funds, and insurance companies traditionally have existed to promote savings, loans and health and other insurance.   As a result, we conclude that Defendants cannot be found to have engaged in state action under the \"traditional public function\" test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Symbiotic Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State action can be found by way of a symbiotic relationship.   Under this test, a private party's acts \"are attributable to the state only if the government 'has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with [the private entity] that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity....' \"  Ponce, 760 F.2d at 381 (quoting Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106208\"><a href=\"/opinion/106208/burton-v-wilmington-parking-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 725, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106208\"><a href=\"/opinion/106208/burton-v-wilmington-parking-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span> (1961)).   While \"one of the key factors in determining whether a symbiotic relationship exists is certainly whether the state shared in any profits made,\" the lack of a financial partnership is not necessarily dispositive.  Rodriguez-Garcia, 904 F.2d at 98-99 (listing several factors relevant to finding \"symbiotic relationship\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Burton, the Court found state action where the state leased public property to a private restaurant owner, who maintained a racially discriminatory policy, acknowledged to be indispensable to the success of the venture.  Burton, 365 U.S. at 723-24, 81 S.Ct. at 860-61.   In contrast, there is no evidence that the government of Puerto Rico somehow profited from the allegedly discriminatory actions of Defendants.   Even though the AEELA receives legally mandated funds from public employees, no contention has been made that this money becomes the property of the AEELA or the government.   In fact, Plaintiffs have not disputed that, upon termination of employment, public employees receive back their funds.   While the Puerto Rico Secretary of the Treasury does approve the investments made by the AEELA with these funds, Plaintiffs have not contended that these funds are somehow used to the benefit of the government of Puerto Rico, rather than invested at a market rate of return.   Also, Plaintiffs have not even attempted to link the alleged election rigging to some financial gain to the government of Puerto Rico, in the way that the discrimination in Burton was linked to the state's returns from the venture.   Thus, whatever financial success the AEELA may achieve is not shared with the government of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, while the lack of financial enrichment is not dispositive, and \"[t]he test is one of interdependence and joint participation,\" we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs have failed to contest the proposition that the AEELA is essentially independent in the conduct of its daily affairs.   And no attempt has been made to link the government of Puerto Rico to the decisions of when to hold the Assembly and how to conduct Board elections.   As a result, we conclude that no symbiotic relationship exists between the government of Puerto Rico and the AEELA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In passing, we observe that in the instant case, Plaintiffs have not premised their claim on a private party's specific act, directed by the government of Puerto Rico, which somehow benefits the government via a symbiotic relationship with the private actor.   This point can be illustrated by comparison with the symbiotic relationship that led to a finding of state action in Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1458060\"><a href=\"/opinion/1458060/schneider-v-colegio-de-abogados-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1983), vacated on other grounds Romany v.

In Schneider, the plaintiffs charged that Puerto Rico laws forcing them to be members of Puerto Rico's integrated bar association violated their rights to free speech and free association, since those laws forced them to belong to, and financially support, an organization (the Colegio) which promoted ideological and political causes contrary to their personal beliefs.  Id. at 965-66.   The court found state action, noting not only that Puerto Rico law required attorneys to maintain membership in the Colegio, but also emphasizing that required membership aided the Colegio's public function of regulating lawyers, from which the government was found to benefit.  Id. at 973-74.   Essentially, the government of Puerto Rico was found to be advantaged by the specific act on which the complaint was grounded, namely, forced membership in the Colegio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, plaintiffs in the instant case do not mount a facial challenge to the laws that create the AEELA or require that it hold elections.   Instead, they argue that the AEELA's leadership committed discretionary acts of discrimination, and did so while exercising authority granted by the government of Puerto Rico.   But plaintiffs fall short of Schneider in at least two ways.   First, the conduct they complain of--discrimination--is not specifically mandated by Puerto Rico law, as forced membership in the Colegio was for lawyers in Schneider.   Unlike the plaintiffs in Schneider, Plaintiffs do not challenge conduct specifically directed by Puerto Rico law;  for example, their forced membership in the AEELA or the requirement that the AEELA hold assemblies and elections.   Instead, Plaintiffs complain of the manner in which the assembly and the elections were held--this manner is not directed by statute.   Second, Plaintiffs have failed to link these specific acts of discrimination in the holding of AEELA's assembly and elections to any symbiotic relationship by which the government profits from these specific discriminatory acts.   No allegation has been made that the government of Puerto Rico is somehow advantaged by the alleged misconduct in AEELA's assembly or elections.   By contrast, in Schneider, bar membership required by Puerto Rico law constituted the conduct complained of, and also was alleged to benefit the government of Puerto Rico, since compulsory membership made possible the Colegio's regulatory functions.   As a result of these distinctions, we conclude that Schneider does not avail Plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To maintain a Section 1983 action, state action must be present.
