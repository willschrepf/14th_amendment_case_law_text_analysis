Code, § 422.75, subd. (a); all further statutory\nreferences are to this code) on two counts of criminal threats (§ 422). Although the\nprosecutor did not charge Badillo with a gang offense or enhancement (§ 186.22, subds.\n(a) & (b)), the trial court admitted evidence of Badillo’s gang affiliation, but only if it\ntended to show an alleged group animus towards African-Americans. (See People v.\nBadillo (G050742, Apr. 28, 2015) [nonpub. opn.].) In Badillo’s direct appeal, however,\nwe observed the prosecutor far exceeded the court’s pretrial ruling contemplating the\nadmission of gang evidence. “In fact,” we noted, “this panel has seen less gang evidence\nin cases where the gang offense and enhancement are at issue.” (Id. at p. 14.) But\nbecause the court’s pretrial ruling was within its discretion at the time it was made, and\ncounsel did not object to the prosecution’s gang evidence at trial, nor did Badillo “argue\non appeal his defense counsel was ineffective,” we affirmed the judgment. (Id. at p. 15;\naccord, id. (Aronson, J., concurring) at p. 3 [“We cannot reach the issue of trial counsel’s\ncompetence, however, because the matter was not raised on appeal”].)\n              Badillo now raises the issue, along with additional IAC claims for failure to\nobject to a booking statement he allegedly made and for failure to object that his\nenhanced sentence of 46 years to life constituted cruel and unusual punishment. We\ngrant Badillo’s petition on the gang evidence issue, rendering his other claims moot.\n                                               I\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n              The underlying incident arose in July 2010 in Hemet when Badillo’s\nneighbor and former friend, Vernon Phillips, hired Ivory Russell to move Phillips’s\nbelongings. Russell is African-American, and Russell brought a friend, Christopher\nKaiser, who is of mixed race, half African-American.\n\n                                               2\n\f              Phillips and Badillo lived across the street from each other and had been\nfriends before they had a recent “falling out” because, according to Phillips, he gave\nBadillo’s wife, Marlene Badillo, a ride when she and Badillo were separated. According\nto Marlene Badillo, Phillips told her she was too good for Badillo, she should leave him\naltogether, and he asked for a kiss. She claimed she did not tell Badillo about Phillips’s\noverture until after Badillo was arrested because she did not want to ruin their friendship.\nIt appears Badillo may have had his suspicions, but he claimed he was only angry briefly\nwith Phillips because Phillips had been drinking when he gave his wife the ride.\n              In any event, several months earlier when Badillo had a better relationship\nwith Phillips, he took Phillips to buy a rifle, which Phillips stored in his own garage.\nPhillips claimed the rifle belonged to Badillo and he only kept it in his garage for awhile\nbecause Marlene Badillo did not want guns around her children. Badillo discovered the\ngun in his backyard the morning before the incident, and he assumed Phillips had stashed\nit there.\n              According to Badillo, he was outside his home on Phillips’s moving day\nwhen Russell began eyeing him in an aggressive manner. According to Russell, the\nencounter had racial overtones before Badillo even approached. Russell heard Badillo\nsay to a couple walking nearby, in reference to Russell and Kaiser, “They’re not\nsupposed to be in this area” or something similar, along with a derogatory comment in a\n“belligerent” tone. Russell and Badillo stared at each other, and Badillo asked, “Why\n[are] you mad-dogging me?”\n              Russell thought he heard Badillo use the word “nigger,” but acknowledged\nit could have been “What’s up nigga,” or just “nigga,” which he considered less\nderogatory and in other circumstances might have made him laugh. Badillo claimed he\nsaid, “My nigga, my nigga, where’s Bubba? What’s happening? Where’s Bubba,”\nwhich was his nickname for Phillips. Badillo was hot in the 100 degree heat and upset\nthat Russell and Kaiser had been yelling insults at him, but he wanted to return Phillips’\n\n                                              3\n\fgun before Phillips moved because Badillo knew he was not supposed to possess a\nfirearm.\n              According to Russell, the confrontation became expressly charged with\nracism when Badillo stated, “Yeah, we don’t like your kind in this area.” Russell\nresponded, “Hey, man. I’m here to work. Do a job. It ain’t got nothing to do with you.”\nBut he admitted he was angry and took a step toward Badillo, demanding, “Well, what do\nyou want to do?” When Badillo also advanced, Kaiser heard Russell say something like,\n“Come on. Bring it.”\n              Badillo retreated to his home, but then returned with a rifle, which Russell\nagreed he was only holding vertically, not pointing it at anyone. But Badillo and Russell\nwere both still angry and hostile. At some point either before or after Badillo pointed the\nrifle at Russell — the evidence was conflicting as to when — Russell stated, “If you’re\ngoing to shoot me, you might as well kill me. Because if I get my hands on you, I’m\ngoing to kill you.” Badillo denied pointing the gun at Russell, who taunted him and also\nused the word “nigga,” boasting, “Nigga, you better make it count [or] I’m gonna kill\nyou.” Russell and Kaiser heard Badillo threaten them, “I’ll kill you, nigger” or “I’m\ngoing to kill you Niggas.”\n              Kaiser fled into Phillips’ house to call 911, and urged Russell to follow\nhim, but according to Kaiser, Russell stood firm “with his chest poked out,” arguing with\nBadillo. Badillo pointed the rifle at Russell’s chest for five to eight seconds, then\nlowered it, and walked back inside his house. He reappeared with his children, and as\nthey entered his car, the police arrived and arrested him.\n              The prosecutor charged Badillo with one count each of making of making a\ncriminal threat against Russell and Kaiser, with a hate-crime enhancement based on\nBadillo’s alleged racial animus, and also charged Badillo with prohibited possession by a\nfelon of a firearm and ammunition. Badillo and several witnesses testified in his defense,\nincluding the couple who had been walking nearby when the confrontation erupted. The\n\n                                              4\n\fjury deadlocked on all counts: four jurors voted to acquit Badillo on the threat counts,\nand eight to convict; nine to convict on the firearm possession count, and 11 to acquit on\npossessing ammunition. The prosecutor had introduced some gang evidence, but it was\nlimited in scope, consisting primarily of a gang expert’s testimony spanning 22 pages in\nthe trial transcript.\n               At defendant’s second trial on the same charges, the prosecutor in a pretrial\nmotion sought permission to introduce gang evidence again because it had been admitted\nin the first trial and Badillo’s affiliation with the “Pico Rivera 13” criminal street gang\nwas relevant to prove the hate-crime allegation. Defense counsel objected because\nalthough Badillo had associated with a gang when he lived in Pico Rivera, he had moved\naway when he was a teenager. Now in his thirties, Badillo lived in Hemet and his street\nwhere the altercation occurred was more than 80 miles from Pico Rivera. He objected\nthat the gang evidence would inflame the jury against him in a case involving no gang\noffense or enhancements.\n               The trial court granted the prosecutor’s pretrial motion, but with the proviso\nthat gang evidence was irrelevant absent a connection to alleged racial bias in the Pico\nRivera 13 (Rivera or Rivera 13) criminal street gang. The court explained at the hearing:\n“If the expert were to testify that they do have certain attitudes, opinions toward blacks, if\nthey have committed crimes against blacks, if they have been involved in what might be\nconsidered hate crimes, that’s one thing. If that testimony is not forthcoming, then the\ngang affiliation, I think, would be irrelevant.” (Italics added.) Addressing the prosecutor,\nthe court continued, “But I am assuming, I am guessing they are going to testify about\nsome opinions, attitudes, actions toward members of races other than those who belong to\nthe gang and probably blacks; is that correct?” The prosecutor answered affirmatively.\n               On that basis, the trial court concluded gang evidence would be relevant\nand more probative than prejudicial, to the extent it showed racial animus. But the court\ncautioned that “there has to be some foundation laid regarding the crimes that the gang\n\n                                              5\n\fhas been involved with — there have to be some limits on that. And regarding hate type\ncrimes I would allow more evidence regarding that because that’s important in this case.”\nIn contrast, the court observed, “I don’t know if there are any predicate crimes or\nanything. Because it’s not a gang case.” The prosecutor and defense counsel stipulated\nRivera 13 was “a documented and active criminal street gang.” The prosecutor offered\nthe stipulation so her expert “doesn’t hav[e] to go into the history of the gang and prove\nup prior predicate acts,” other than evidence to support the hate-crime allegation.\n              At trial, the prosecutor introduced the testimony of four of the Hemet police\nofficers who responded to the incident, spanning a few pages each in the transcript, and\nextensive testimony of five officers on gang issues, including one who had not testified in\nthe first trial, and a new gang expert. The defense had not called a gang expert to testify\nin the first trial, but did so in the second trial to rebut the prosecutor’s increased focus on\ngangs. Not including the testimony of the defense expert, the volume of gang evidence in\nthe second trial more than doubled. Defense counsel did not object before, during, or\nafter the testimony of any of the gang witnesses. Counsel noted the breadth of the gang\nevidence in his closing remarks to the jury by estimating that “80 percent of the evidence\nthat was put on in this case was gang evidence,” but again made no objection nor\notherwise called on the trial court to exclude the evidence.\n              As summarized in our opinion in the direct appeal, Officer Kevin Lloyd\ntestified as the prosecution’s gang expert: “After detailing his background, training, and\nexperience, Lloyd testified concerning primarily criminal street gangs in Pico Rivera,\nincluding Rivera 13, one of four major gangs in Pico Rivera. Lloyd testified concerning\nthe culture and habits of criminal street gangs, including how someone joins a gang, the\nimportance of respect, and the significance of gang tattoos. Lloyd said Rivera was a\nsouthern Hispanic gang that was loyal to the Mexican Mafia and was called ‘Rivera 13,’\n‘Rivera Trece,’ ‘Viejo Rivera,’ ‘Viejas,’ ‘R13,’ ‘RV’” or ‘Rivera Trece Parkside.’ He\ntestified at length concerning the Hispanic gang hierarchy from Rivera, [up] to Surenos,\n\n                                               6\n\fwho are southern gang members, [up] to the Mexican Mafia. He analogized the gang\nhierarchy to sports and said Rivera was high school level, Surenos college level, and\nMexican Mafia professional level. He said Surenos have ‘Sureno’ and ‘Southside’\ntattoos and Mexican Mafia have ‘black hand,’ ‘E,’ ‘M–A,’ ‘red lipstick kiss,’ which\nrepresents the number ‘13, and ‘13’ tattoos. He said the number ‘13’ is significant\nbecause it represents ‘M,’ the 13th letter of the alphabet.\n              “Lloyd stated Rivera 13’s primary activities were vandalism, possession of\nweapons, narcotics sales, and assaults from beatings to murder. Lloyd said there were\nnot many racially motivated crimes in Pico Rivera because the city was predominantly\nHispanic, but there were racially motivated crimes in jail involving Rivera 13 against\nAfrican-Americans even though they are segregated. He added Rivera 13 gang members\nhave disdain for African-Americans and any disrespect has to be met with violence. He\nstated Rivera 13 gang members are almost always armed and they use weapons to sell\nnarcotics, the proceeds of which they send to the Mexican Mafia. The parties stipulated\n‘Pico Rivera 13,’ also known as ‘Rivera 13’ or ‘R13,’ is an active criminal street gang in\nLos Angeles County.\n              “Lloyd said it was common for Rivera 13 gang members to move from\nPico Rivera and still be a part of the gang because if you rise to the level of a Sureno, you\nare respected throughout Southern California. He said to leave the gang you have to\nremove the gang tattoos. Lloyd opined Badillo was an active member of Rivera 13 based\non his review of his criminal history, prior law enforcement contacts, tattoos, police\nreports, corrections records, and jail telephone calls. He added Badillo was a ‘hardcore\nSureno’ and ‘a more violent gang member predator.’\n              “Lloyd testified concerning the significance of Badillo’s tattoos, including\nnumerous Rivera tattoos. He stated the ‘13’ on his neck indicates he is a Sureno and a\nMexican Mafia member and ‘310’ was the area code for Pico Rivera. He said ‘rock and\nroll gangster’ means Badillo is proud to be a gangster and ‘R’ on his face means he is\n\n                                              7\n\fproud to be from Pico Rivera. He explained the clown on his shoulder has the following\nmeanings: his gang moniker, ‘Payaso,’ which is Spanish for ‘clown’; and it demonstrates\nhe chose a gangster lifestyle and is prepared to accept the eventual consequences—prison\nor death. Lloyd said ‘Sureno’ over his eye is ‘just so there is no doubt that he’s a member\nof the Sureno or the Southern Hispanic gang’ and ‘SE’ on the top of his head means he\nhas graduated from Rivera to all of southeast Los Angeles; he said facial tattoos indicate\nan intent to appear menacing. He said ‘I rather fuck you’ on his forehead is derogatory to\nwomen, consistent with Rivera 13’s male domination. According to Lloyd, ‘You can’t\nget to the level of a Sureno with respect with these tattoos . . . unless you have committed\nviolence, done prison terms.’ Based on hypothetical questions mirroring the facts of the\ncase, Lloyd opined the hypothetical defendant’s conduct was consistent with that of a\nRivera 13 gang member.\n              “On cross-examination, Lloyd stated a Rivera 13 gang member could have\na Caucasian friend or an African–American girlfriend but the gang member could not\ntake the girlfriend to a Rivera 13 party. He added there was one African–American\nRivera 13 gang member. The trial court instructed the jury on the limited purpose of the\ngang testimony after each of the officers testified.” (Badillo, supra, at pp. 6-8.)\n              Badillo testified, denied he was a racist, and claimed Russell was the\naggressor in their altercation. Addressing all the gang evidence, he admitted his family\nhistory as the youngest of seven boys who all belonged to Rivera 13. He had dropped out\nof school in ninth grade and became addicted to heroin, which led to his prior offenses,\nbut these were not gang-related. He claimed he had left his gang participation days\nbehind as a teenager and did not “gang bang[]” in Hemet, and that since his release from\nprison in 2009, he had maintained steady employment and treatment for his drug\naddiction.\n              As recounted in our prior opinion, Badillo “also denied telling the deputy in\njail he ‘does not like blacks or whites.’ Badillo said he told the deputy he ‘house[s] with\n\n                                              8\n\fsouthern Mexicans’ and ‘cannot house with blacks or whites[]’ for his safety and others\npursuant to jail rules. Badillo denied he participated in [a] riot in Pelican Bay prison,\ndenying it was a race riot.” (Badillo, supra, at p. 10.)\n              Elton Johnson, an African-American, testified he knew Badillo from\nchurch, had been friends with him and his family for 20 years, socialized with him, and\nnever knew him to be a racist or to make racist comments, and Badillo’s wife similarly\ntestified. Phillips testified he and Badillo both sometimes engaged in making racial jokes\nabout “everyone,” including whites and blacks, but harbored no hatred or racism.\n              The couple who had witnessed at least some of the altercation again\ntestified as defense witnesses. Some of their testimony and prior statements supported\nBadillo’s version of events, and some supported Russell’s.\n              The parties stipulated that in August 2004 Badillo was convicted of\ndamaging or destroying a telephone line, a felony under section 591, and he was\nprohibited from possessing a firearm or ammunition. Badillo argued he fell within a\nstatutory exemption because he discovered the weapon in his yard and it would have\ntaken him less time to return it to Padilla than to law enforcement (see §§ 29850, 30305\n[providing for justifiable possession of a firearm or ammunition by a felon or other\nprohibited persons in certain circumstances]), until Russell threatened to kill him with the\ngun.\n              The trial court instructed the jury with CALJIC No. 17.24.3, as follows:\n“Evidence has been introduced for the purpose of showing criminal street gang activities,\nand of criminal acts by gang members, other than the crimes for which defendant is on\ntrial. [¶] This evidence, if believed, may not be considered by you to prove that\ndefendant is a person of bad character or that he has a disposition to commit crimes. It\nmay be considered by you only for the limited purpose of determining whether the\noffenses set forth in Counts 1 & 2 were motivated by Defendant’s bias. [¶] For the\nlimited purpose for which you may consider this evidence, you must weigh it in the same\n\n                                              9\n\fmanner as you do all other evidence in the case. [¶] You are not permitted to consider\nsuch evidence for any other purpose.”\n              The second jury again was unable to reach a verdict on the criminal threat\ncount involving Kaiser or the hate crime allegation on the threat against Russell. This\ntime, however, the jury convicted Badillo of threatening Russell, found true the allegation\nhe personally used a firearm in doing so (§§ 12022.5, subd. (a), 1192.7, subd. (c)(8)), and\nconvicted him of the firearm and ammunition possession counts.\n              The trial court sentenced Badillo to a determinate term of 21 years,\nconsisting of the upper term of six years on the firearm possession count, the middle term\nof four years on the firearm use enhancement, two five-year prison terms on prior serious\nfelony conviction enhancements (§ 667, subd. (a)) that the court found true in a\nbifurcated proceeding, and a one-year term on a prior prison term enhancement (§ 667.5,\nsubd. (b)) the court also found true. The court sentenced Badillo under the Three Strikes\nLaw to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life on the threat conviction, and entered a\nstay under section 654 on the ammunition count.\n              In Badillo’s direct appeal, the panel concluded, “Although we are troubled\nby the volume of gang evidence admitted at trial, we conclude the court did not err.”\n(Badillo, supra, at p. 2.) Our opinion explained that, under People v. Lindberg (2008)\n45 Cal.4th 1, 6, “gang evidence, including expert testimony, may be admissible, even\nwhen gang offenses and enhancements are not charged, if the gang evidence is relevant to\nan issue in the case. Here, the prosecutor alleged Badillo made criminal threats because\nof Russell’s and Kaiser’s race (§ 422.75, subd. (a)). Thus, any gang evidence that tended\nto prove the hate crime allegations was relevant. In other words, evidence Rivera 13\ngang members harbor ill feelings towards African-Americans and Badillo was a\nRivera 13 gang member would be relevant because it would tend to establish Badillo\nharbored ill feelings toward African-Americans and he made the criminal threats against\nRussell and Kaiser because they were African-American.” (Badillo, at pp. 13-14.)\n\n                                            10\n\f               While the trial court conditioned admission of gang evidence on its linkage,\nif any, to Rivera 13’s alleged group bias, “the gang evidence went beyond that here,” but\n“defense counsel never objected to the prosecutor’s questions as violating the court’s\npretrial ruling.” (Badillo, supra, at pp. 14-15.) Consequently, as the concurring opinion\nexplained, no reversible error could be traced to the trial court because its rulings are\nevaluated at the time they are made, and absent an objection when “‘the evidence is\nactually offered, and the court is aware of its relevance in context, its probative value, and\nits potential for prejudice . . . , the court cannot intelligently rule on admissibility.’\nBadillo’s defense lawyer therefore had the responsibility to object if the prosecutor failed\nto provide a proper foundation for the gang evidence.” (Id., at conc., p. 2.) The panel\nagreed that Badillo’s remedy, if any, lay in a habeas petition. (Id. at p. 3; accord, id. at\np. 15 [observing that Badillo did not raise IAC in his direct appeal, “[p]erhaps . . .\nbecause [such] a claim . . . “‘“is more appropriately raised in a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus”’”].)\n                                                II\n                                         DISCUSSION\n               Badillo now asserts his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of\ncounsel by failing to object to the mountain of gang evidence admitted without any\nconnection to Rivera 13’s or Badillo’s alleged racial animus. We agree. In People v.\nAlbarran (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 214, 232, the court observed in reversing a murder\nconviction where the evidence did not support the alleged gang enhancement, “Given the\nnature and amount of this gang evidence at issue, the number of witnesses who testified\nto Albarran’s gang affiliations and the role the gang evidence played in the prosecutor’s\nargument,” the court could not conclude the gang evidence “did not contribute to the\nverdict.” Here, the sheer volume of gang evidence in this nongang case is staggering, and\nits prejudicial effect requires granting Badillo’s petition for habeas relief and an untainted\nnew trial.\n\n                                               11\n\f              The standard of review for an IAC claim is well settled. To prevail, a\ndefendant must show that counsel’s performance fell below prevailing professional\nstandards and was prejudicial. (Strickland v. Washington (1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-694\n(Strickland).) To prove prejudice, the defendant must demonstrate a “‘reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\nwould have been different.’” (People v. Ledesma (1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 217-218.) “‘“A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\noutcome.’ [Citations.]”’” (People v. Weaver (2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 925.)\n              There is no question Strickland’s first prong is satisfied here. Trial counsel\nhas filed an affidavit in support of Badillo’s habeas petition explaining he assumed his\npretrial objection was sufficient, but as we explained in the direct appeal, that is not the\ncase, and counsel now acknowledges as much. Simply put, “[a] tentative pretrial\nevidentiary ruling, made without fully knowing what the trial evidence would show, will\nnot preserve the issue for appeal if the appellant could have, but did not, renew the\nobjection or offer of proof and press for a final ruling in the changed context of the trial\nevidence itself. [Citations.]” (People v. Holloway (2004) 33 Cal.4th 96, 133.) “One of\nthe principal tasks of a defense attorney is to attempt to protect his or her client from the\nadmission of evidence that is more prejudicial than probative” (In re Jones (1996)\n13 Cal.4th 552, 581), and by failing to object to the prosecutor’s relentless stream of gang\nevidence untethered to racial animus, counsel’s performance did not meet the required\nstandard here.\n              The Attorney General does not dispute that trial counsel’s performance was\ndeficient, arguing only that Badillo has not shown prejudice “for four reasons.” First, as\nbetween the evidence that supported Russell’s version of events and the evidence\nsupporting Badillo’s claim Russell was the aggressor, the Attorney General merely\nasserts the former was more credible. But that begs the question of whether the plethora\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fof gang evidence that would not have been admitted if counsel had objected unfairly\nundermined Badillo’s credibility. We conclude it did.\n               Badillo denied pointing the rifle at Russell, but he also emphasized Russell\nwas the aggressor. While the evidence was conflicting, it was consistent with his belief\nRussell intended to seize the gun and shoot him when Badillo had not been pointing it at\nanyone. As the concurring opinion on appeal observed, the improper gang evidence had\n“disastrous consequences” for Badillo’s defense. (Supra, at p. 2.) “It seems probable the\ninflammatory gang evidence influenced the jury to reject his testimony. The jury likely\nconcluded that Badillo was the kind of person who would threaten [Russell] with a gun\nbecause he belonged to a gang that had committed at least 20 murders, maintained ties to\nthe Mexican Mafia, and its members, including Badillo, commonly carried guns to\nsupport their criminal endeavors. Indeed, it is doubtful a jury would believe anyone who\nfit this profile.” (Ibid.)\n               Second, while the Attorney General concedes Badillo’s credibility was\n“crucial to his defense, his credibility was severely undermined even without the\nadditional gang evidence.” The Attorney General points to the evidence “that petitioner\nwas a Rivera 13 gang member and that Rivera 13 and petitioner personally harbored\nracial animus toward African-Americans.” But that evidence was conflicting and slight\nin comparison to the deluge of improper gang evidence with no relation to racial animus.\nFor example, the prosecution’s evidence showing Rivera 13’s racial antagonism toward\nAfrican-Americans only occurred in a custodial setting. Lloyd admitted his opinion that\nRivera 13 gang members “disdain” African-Americans was based on his experience\n“mostly in the jail,” but as we observed in the direct appeal, “Needless to say, the\nincident here did not occur while Badillo was in custody, and a person’s institutional\nbehavior is not necessarily predictive of how that person will act while out of custody.”\n(Badillo, supra, at p. 14.) But defense counsel did not object to any of Lloyd’s\ntestimony.\n\n                                             13\n\f              The Attorney General also points to Badillo’s admission he had been to\nprison four times, including for assault with a deadly weapon and robbery, and also\nderides as “implausible” Badillo’s claim he wanted to return Phillips’s rifle. But many of\nthe witnesses had felony convictions, including Kaiser, who testified both to Badillo’s\nracial animus and to Russell’s aggressive conduct. The wife in the husband-and-wife\ncouple who were walking nearby during the altercation expressly recalled she heard\nBadillo state he was returning Phillips’ gun, while her husband’s statements were\nequivocal on whether Badillo pointed the gun at Russell. Badillo’s felony record was\nintroduced in the first trial as well, but that jury hung. The scope of the gang evidence\nmarked the only significant difference between the two trials. It was the jury’s\nprerogative to credit witness testimony, in whole or in part. Consequently, the impact of\nthe improper gang evidence on Badillo’s credibility cannot be overstated.\n              Third, the Attorney General argues that while the jury asked several\nquestions during deliberations and had the testimony of several witnesses read back, none\ninvolved the gang evidence. The Attorney General deduces from this and from the jury’s\nverdict acquitting Badillo of the threat against Kaiser and the hate-crime allegation that\nthe jury discharged its duties carefully and was not influenced by irrelevant or excessive\ngang evidence. But the jury asked six questions in the first trial and four in the second,\nand in both requested readbacks of the testimony about the confrontation, demonstrating\nthe case was a close one.\n              If the jury had quickly returned guilty verdicts, the Attorney General would\nargue it showed the evidence was so overwhelming there could be no conceivable\nprejudice. Her argument here that protracted deliberations resulting in a partial acquittal\nshowed only a thoughtful jury unswayed by prejudice is appealing in theory, but merely\nspeculative. The Attorney General points to nothing in the second trial that was absent in\nthe first trial to explain the different verdicts. We find it compelling that the jury hung in\nthe first trial without the superfluous gang evidence; indeed, a full third of the jurors\n\n                                              14\n\fbelieved Badillo was entitled to acquittal on the threat counts. These circumstances\nundermine our confidence in the jury’s second verdict. There is a reasonable probability\ncounsel’s failure to object to the irrelevant gang evidence explains the divergent\noutcomes, to Badillo’s detriment, and no more is required. (Strickland, supra, 466 U.S.\nat p. 684.)\n              Finally, the Attorney General relies on the trial court’s limiting instructions.\nOrdinarily, we presume the jury heeds the trial court’s directions, particularly instructions\nlimiting its consideration of evidence. (People v. Avila (2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 574.) But\nan overwhelming volume of improper evidence may outweigh the trial court’s best\nintentions (Albarran, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at pp. 226-228), and our courts have long\nrecognized the particularly volatile nature of gang evidence. (People v. Hernandez\n(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1040, 1049 (Hernandez); People v. Gurule (2002) 28 Cal.4th 557, 653;\nPeople v. Cardenas (1982) 31 Cal.3d 897, 904-905 (Cardenas); People v. Avitia (2005)\n127 Cal.App.4th 185, 193; People v. Bojorquez (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 335, 342.)\n              In Cardenas, for example, the Supreme Court observed in reversing the\ndefendant’s attempted murder conviction that the “error in admitting the evidence of\ncommon membership in the Flores gang was compounded by the prosecutor’s broad\ninquiries suggesting that the gang was involved in [unrelated] criminal activities. These\nquestions made it a near certainty that the jury viewed appellant as more likely to have\ncommitted the violent offenses charged against him because of his membership in the\nFlores gang.” (Cardenas, supra, 31 Cal.3d at p. 906.) Accordingly, “[i]n cases not\ninvolving the gang enhancement,” the high court has held that gang evidence “is\npotentially prejudicial and should not be admitted if its probative value is minimal.”\n(Hernandez, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1049.)\n              Albarran is instructive. There, the trial court granted a new trial motion\nconcluding there was insufficient evidence to support the gang enhancement, but ruled\nsome gang evidence was relevant to prove motive or intent for the substantive counts,\n\n                                             15\n\fwhich included attempted murder, shooting at an inhabited dwelling and attempted\nkidnapping for carjacking. On appeal, the reviewing court held that even if some gang\nevidence were relevant on these issues, the lower court erred in admitting other extremely\ninflammatory evidence—including references to the Mexican Mafia, threats to kill police\nofficers, and descriptions of criminal activities by other gang members—that had no\nconnection to the underlying charges. (Albarran, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at pp. 226-228.)\nUnder the circumstances, rather than showing motive and intent, the gang evidence\nserved only to inflame the jury and show defendant’s dangerous and criminal disposition.\n(Id. at p. 230.)\n               Similarly here, the jury heard a great deal of prejudicial gang evidence,\nincluding as in Albarran irrelevant and ominous references to the Mexican Mafia and\nunrelated criminal offenses. The prosecutor introduced gang expert testimony on a full\nscore of gang murders and assaults, delving into Rivera 13’s asserted gang history in\nwhich its members were “almost always armed,” and declaring, “Almost every Rivera\nSouthern Hispanic will have done violence.” None of this extremely prejudicial gang\nevidence had any connection to the issue of racial animus, which the court required in its\npretrial ruling.\n               The Supreme Court has cautioned that gang evidence must be scrutinized\neven when it is relevant, due to its potentially inflammatory impact. (People v. Carter\n(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1166, 1194.) That did not occur here because counsel failed to object\ndespite the trial court’s pretrial foundation requirement indicating it “would have\nexcluded most, if not all, the gang evidence that shed no light on whether the Pico\nRivera 13 gang harbored racial animus toward African-Americans or committed hate\ncrimes against them.” (Badillo, supra, conc. at p. 2.) Because the vast majority of the\nprosecutor’s gang evidence had no “bearing on whether Badillo or his gang harbored\nracial animus” (ibid.), Badillo has established the requisite prejudice for his IAC claim\nand a new trial without the improper evidence.\n\n                                             16\n\f                                             III\n                                      DISPOSITION\n              Badillo’s habeas corpus petition is granted. Let a peremptory writ issue\ndirecting the trial court to vacate Badillo’s conviction and sentence, and the matter is\nremanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                                   ARONSON, ACTING P.

Code, § 422.75, subd. (a); all further statutory\nreferences are to this code) on two counts of criminal threats (§ 422). Although the\nprosecutor did not charge Badillo with a gang offense or enhancement (§ 186.22, subds.\n(a) & (b)), the trial court admitted evidence of Badillo’s gang affiliation, but only if it\ntended to show an alleged group animus towards African-Americans. (See People v.\nBadillo (G050742, Apr. 28, 2015) [nonpub. opn.].) In Badillo’s direct appeal, however,\nwe observed the prosecutor far exceeded the court’s pretrial ruling contemplating the\nadmission of gang evidence. “In fact,” we noted, “this panel has seen less gang evidence\nin cases where the gang offense and enhancement are at issue.” (Id. at p. 14.) But\nbecause the court’s pretrial ruling was within its discretion at the time it was made, and\ncounsel did not object to the prosecution’s gang evidence at trial, nor did Badillo “argue\non appeal his defense counsel was ineffective,” we affirmed the judgment. (Id. at p. 15;\naccord, id. (Aronson, J., concurring) at p. 3 [“We cannot reach the issue of trial counsel’s\ncompetence, however, because the matter was not raised on appeal”].)\n              Badillo now raises the issue, along with additional IAC claims for failure to\nobject to a booking statement he allegedly made and for failure to object that his\nenhanced sentence of 46 years to life constituted cruel and unusual punishment. We\ngrant Badillo’s petition on the gang evidence issue, rendering his other claims moot.\n                                               I\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n              The underlying incident arose in July 2010 in Hemet when Badillo’s\nneighbor and former friend, Vernon Phillips, hired Ivory Russell to move Phillips’s\nbelongings. Russell is African-American, and Russell brought a friend, Christopher\nKaiser, who is of mixed race, half African-American.\n\n                                               2\n\f              Phillips and Badillo lived across the street from each other and had been\nfriends before they had a recent “falling out” because, according to Phillips, he gave\nBadillo’s wife, Marlene Badillo, a ride when she and Badillo were separated. According\nto Marlene Badillo, Phillips told her she was too good for Badillo, she should leave him\naltogether, and he asked for a kiss. She claimed she did not tell Badillo about Phillips’s\noverture until after Badillo was arrested because she did not want to ruin their friendship.\nIt appears Badillo may have had his suspicions, but he claimed he was only angry briefly\nwith Phillips because Phillips had been drinking when he gave his wife the ride.\n              In any event, several months earlier when Badillo had a better relationship\nwith Phillips, he took Phillips to buy a rifle, which Phillips stored in his own garage.\nPhillips claimed the rifle belonged to Badillo and he only kept it in his garage for awhile\nbecause Marlene Badillo did not want guns around her children. Badillo discovered the\ngun in his backyard the morning before the incident, and he assumed Phillips had stashed\nit there.\n              According to Badillo, he was outside his home on Phillips’s moving day\nwhen Russell began eyeing him in an aggressive manner. According to Russell, the\nencounter had racial overtones before Badillo even approached. Russell heard Badillo\nsay to a couple walking nearby, in reference to Russell and Kaiser, “They’re not\nsupposed to be in this area” or something similar, along with a derogatory comment in a\n“belligerent” tone. Russell and Badillo stared at each other, and Badillo asked, “Why\n[are] you mad-dogging me?”\n              Russell thought he heard Badillo use the word “nigger,” but acknowledged\nit could have been “What’s up nigga,” or just “nigga,” which he considered less\nderogatory and in other circumstances might have made him laugh. Badillo claimed he\nsaid, “My nigga, my nigga, where’s Bubba? What’s happening? Where’s Bubba,”\nwhich was his nickname for Phillips. Badillo was hot in the 100 degree heat and upset\nthat Russell and Kaiser had been yelling insults at him, but he wanted to return Phillips’\n\n                                              3\n\fgun before Phillips moved because Badillo knew he was not supposed to possess a\nfirearm.\n              According to Russell, the confrontation became expressly charged with\nracism when Badillo stated, “Yeah, we don’t like your kind in this area.” Russell\nresponded, “Hey, man. I’m here to work. Do a job. It ain’t got nothing to do with you.”\nBut he admitted he was angry and took a step toward Badillo, demanding, “Well, what do\nyou want to do?” When Badillo also advanced, Kaiser heard Russell say something like,\n“Come on. Bring it.”\n              Badillo retreated to his home, but then returned with a rifle, which Russell\nagreed he was only holding vertically, not pointing it at anyone. But Badillo and Russell\nwere both still angry and hostile. At some point either before or after Badillo pointed the\nrifle at Russell — the evidence was conflicting as to when — Russell stated, “If you’re\ngoing to shoot me, you might as well kill me. Because if I get my hands on you, I’m\ngoing to kill you.” Badillo denied pointing the gun at Russell, who taunted him and also\nused the word “nigga,” boasting, “Nigga, you better make it count [or] I’m gonna kill\nyou.” Russell and Kaiser heard Badillo threaten them, “I’ll kill you, nigger” or “I’m\ngoing to kill you Niggas.”\n              Kaiser fled into Phillips’ house to call 911, and urged Russell to follow\nhim, but according to Kaiser, Russell stood firm “with his chest poked out,” arguing with\nBadillo. Badillo pointed the rifle at Russell’s chest for five to eight seconds, then\nlowered it, and walked back inside his house. He reappeared with his children, and as\nthey entered his car, the police arrived and arrested him.\n              The prosecutor charged Badillo with one count each of making of making a\ncriminal threat against Russell and Kaiser, with a hate-crime enhancement based on\nBadillo’s alleged racial animus, and also charged Badillo with prohibited possession by a\nfelon of a firearm and ammunition. Badillo and several witnesses testified in his defense,\nincluding the couple who had been walking nearby when the confrontation erupted. The\n\n                                              4\n\fjury deadlocked on all counts: four jurors voted to acquit Badillo on the threat counts,\nand eight to convict; nine to convict on the firearm possession count, and 11 to acquit on\npossessing ammunition. The prosecutor had introduced some gang evidence, but it was\nlimited in scope, consisting primarily of a gang expert’s testimony spanning 22 pages in\nthe trial transcript.\n               At defendant’s second trial on the same charges, the prosecutor in a pretrial\nmotion sought permission to introduce gang evidence again because it had been admitted\nin the first trial and Badillo’s affiliation with the “Pico Rivera 13” criminal street gang\nwas relevant to prove the hate-crime allegation. Defense counsel objected because\nalthough Badillo had associated with a gang when he lived in Pico Rivera, he had moved\naway when he was a teenager. Now in his thirties, Badillo lived in Hemet and his street\nwhere the altercation occurred was more than 80 miles from Pico Rivera. He objected\nthat the gang evidence would inflame the jury against him in a case involving no gang\noffense or enhancements.\n               The trial court granted the prosecutor’s pretrial motion, but with the proviso\nthat gang evidence was irrelevant absent a connection to alleged racial bias in the Pico\nRivera 13 (Rivera or Rivera 13) criminal street gang. The court explained at the hearing:\n“If the expert were to testify that they do have certain attitudes, opinions toward blacks, if\nthey have committed crimes against blacks, if they have been involved in what might be\nconsidered hate crimes, that’s one thing. If that testimony is not forthcoming, then the\ngang affiliation, I think, would be irrelevant.” (Italics added.) Addressing the prosecutor,\nthe court continued, “But I am assuming, I am guessing they are going to testify about\nsome opinions, attitudes, actions toward members of races other than those who belong to\nthe gang and probably blacks; is that correct?” The prosecutor answered affirmatively.\n               On that basis, the trial court concluded gang evidence would be relevant\nand more probative than prejudicial, to the extent it showed racial animus. But the court\ncautioned that “there has to be some foundation laid regarding the crimes that the gang\n\n                                              5\n\fhas been involved with — there have to be some limits on that. And regarding hate type\ncrimes I would allow more evidence regarding that because that’s important in this case.”\nIn contrast, the court observed, “I don’t know if there are any predicate crimes or\nanything. Because it’s not a gang case.” The prosecutor and defense counsel stipulated\nRivera 13 was “a documented and active criminal street gang.” The prosecutor offered\nthe stipulation so her expert “doesn’t hav[e] to go into the history of the gang and prove\nup prior predicate acts,” other than evidence to support the hate-crime allegation.\n              At trial, the prosecutor introduced the testimony of four of the Hemet police\nofficers who responded to the incident, spanning a few pages each in the transcript, and\nextensive testimony of five officers on gang issues, including one who had not testified in\nthe first trial, and a new gang expert. The defense had not called a gang expert to testify\nin the first trial, but did so in the second trial to rebut the prosecutor’s increased focus on\ngangs. Not including the testimony of the defense expert, the volume of gang evidence in\nthe second trial more than doubled. Defense counsel did not object before, during, or\nafter the testimony of any of the gang witnesses. Counsel noted the breadth of the gang\nevidence in his closing remarks to the jury by estimating that “80 percent of the evidence\nthat was put on in this case was gang evidence,” but again made no objection nor\notherwise called on the trial court to exclude the evidence.\n              As summarized in our opinion in the direct appeal, Officer Kevin Lloyd\ntestified as the prosecution’s gang expert: “After detailing his background, training, and\nexperience, Lloyd testified concerning primarily criminal street gangs in Pico Rivera,\nincluding Rivera 13, one of four major gangs in Pico Rivera. Lloyd testified concerning\nthe culture and habits of criminal street gangs, including how someone joins a gang, the\nimportance of respect, and the significance of gang tattoos. Lloyd said Rivera was a\nsouthern Hispanic gang that was loyal to the Mexican Mafia and was called ‘Rivera 13,’\n‘Rivera Trece,’ ‘Viejo Rivera,’ ‘Viejas,’ ‘R13,’ ‘RV’” or ‘Rivera Trece Parkside.’ He\ntestified at length concerning the Hispanic gang hierarchy from Rivera, [up] to Surenos,\n\n                                               6\n\fwho are southern gang members, [up] to the Mexican Mafia. He analogized the gang\nhierarchy to sports and said Rivera was high school level, Surenos college level, and\nMexican Mafia professional level. He said Surenos have ‘Sureno’ and ‘Southside’\ntattoos and Mexican Mafia have ‘black hand,’ ‘E,’ ‘M–A,’ ‘red lipstick kiss,’ which\nrepresents the number ‘13, and ‘13’ tattoos. He said the number ‘13’ is significant\nbecause it represents ‘M,’ the 13th letter of the alphabet.\n              “Lloyd stated Rivera 13’s primary activities were vandalism, possession of\nweapons, narcotics sales, and assaults from beatings to murder. Lloyd said there were\nnot many racially motivated crimes in Pico Rivera because the city was predominantly\nHispanic, but there were racially motivated crimes in jail involving Rivera 13 against\nAfrican-Americans even though they are segregated. He added Rivera 13 gang members\nhave disdain for African-Americans and any disrespect has to be met with violence. He\nstated Rivera 13 gang members are almost always armed and they use weapons to sell\nnarcotics, the proceeds of which they send to the Mexican Mafia. The parties stipulated\n‘Pico Rivera 13,’ also known as ‘Rivera 13’ or ‘R13,’ is an active criminal street gang in\nLos Angeles County.\n              “Lloyd said it was common for Rivera 13 gang members to move from\nPico Rivera and still be a part of the gang because if you rise to the level of a Sureno, you\nare respected throughout Southern California. He said to leave the gang you have to\nremove the gang tattoos. Lloyd opined Badillo was an active member of Rivera 13 based\non his review of his criminal history, prior law enforcement contacts, tattoos, police\nreports, corrections records, and jail telephone calls. He added Badillo was a ‘hardcore\nSureno’ and ‘a more violent gang member predator.’\n              “Lloyd testified concerning the significance of Badillo’s tattoos, including\nnumerous Rivera tattoos. He stated the ‘13’ on his neck indicates he is a Sureno and a\nMexican Mafia member and ‘310’ was the area code for Pico Rivera. He said ‘rock and\nroll gangster’ means Badillo is proud to be a gangster and ‘R’ on his face means he is\n\n                                              7\n\fproud to be from Pico Rivera. He explained the clown on his shoulder has the following\nmeanings: his gang moniker, ‘Payaso,’ which is Spanish for ‘clown’; and it demonstrates\nhe chose a gangster lifestyle and is prepared to accept the eventual consequences—prison\nor death. Lloyd said ‘Sureno’ over his eye is ‘just so there is no doubt that he’s a member\nof the Sureno or the Southern Hispanic gang’ and ‘SE’ on the top of his head means he\nhas graduated from Rivera to all of southeast Los Angeles; he said facial tattoos indicate\nan intent to appear menacing. He said ‘I rather fuck you’ on his forehead is derogatory to\nwomen, consistent with Rivera 13’s male domination. According to Lloyd, ‘You can’t\nget to the level of a Sureno with respect with these tattoos . . . unless you have committed\nviolence, done prison terms.’ Based on hypothetical questions mirroring the facts of the\ncase, Lloyd opined the hypothetical defendant’s conduct was consistent with that of a\nRivera 13 gang member.\n              “On cross-examination, Lloyd stated a Rivera 13 gang member could have\na Caucasian friend or an African–American girlfriend but the gang member could not\ntake the girlfriend to a Rivera 13 party. He added there was one African–American\nRivera 13 gang member. The trial court instructed the jury on the limited purpose of the\ngang testimony after each of the officers testified.” (Badillo, supra, at pp. 6-8.)\n              Badillo testified, denied he was a racist, and claimed Russell was the\naggressor in their altercation. Addressing all the gang evidence, he admitted his family\nhistory as the youngest of seven boys who all belonged to Rivera 13. He had dropped out\nof school in ninth grade and became addicted to heroin, which led to his prior offenses,\nbut these were not gang-related. He claimed he had left his gang participation days\nbehind as a teenager and did not “gang bang[]” in Hemet, and that since his release from\nprison in 2009, he had maintained steady employment and treatment for his drug\naddiction.\n              As recounted in our prior opinion, Badillo “also denied telling the deputy in\njail he ‘does not like blacks or whites.’ Badillo said he told the deputy he ‘house[s] with\n\n                                              8\n\fsouthern Mexicans’ and ‘cannot house with blacks or whites[]’ for his safety and others\npursuant to jail rules. Badillo denied he participated in [a] riot in Pelican Bay prison,\ndenying it was a race riot.” (Badillo, supra, at p. 10.)\n              Elton Johnson, an African-American, testified he knew Badillo from\nchurch, had been friends with him and his family for 20 years, socialized with him, and\nnever knew him to be a racist or to make racist comments, and Badillo’s wife similarly\ntestified. Phillips testified he and Badillo both sometimes engaged in making racial jokes\nabout “everyone,” including whites and blacks, but harbored no hatred or racism.\n              The couple who had witnessed at least some of the altercation again\ntestified as defense witnesses. Some of their testimony and prior statements supported\nBadillo’s version of events, and some supported Russell’s.\n              The parties stipulated that in August 2004 Badillo was convicted of\ndamaging or destroying a telephone line, a felony under section 591, and he was\nprohibited from possessing a firearm or ammunition. Badillo argued he fell within a\nstatutory exemption because he discovered the weapon in his yard and it would have\ntaken him less time to return it to Padilla than to law enforcement (see §§ 29850, 30305\n[providing for justifiable possession of a firearm or ammunition by a felon or other\nprohibited persons in certain circumstances]), until Russell threatened to kill him with the\ngun.\n              The trial court instructed the jury with CALJIC No. 17.24.3, as follows:\n“Evidence has been introduced for the purpose of showing criminal street gang activities,\nand of criminal acts by gang members, other than the crimes for which defendant is on\ntrial. [¶] This evidence, if believed, may not be considered by you to prove that\ndefendant is a person of bad character or that he has a disposition to commit crimes. It\nmay be considered by you only for the limited purpose of determining whether the\noffenses set forth in Counts 1 & 2 were motivated by Defendant’s bias. [¶] For the\nlimited purpose for which you may consider this evidence, you must weigh it in the same\n\n                                              9\n\fmanner as you do all other evidence in the case. [¶] You are not permitted to consider\nsuch evidence for any other purpose.”\n              The second jury again was unable to reach a verdict on the criminal threat\ncount involving Kaiser or the hate crime allegation on the threat against Russell. This\ntime, however, the jury convicted Badillo of threatening Russell, found true the allegation\nhe personally used a firearm in doing so (§§ 12022.5, subd. (a), 1192.7, subd. (c)(8)), and\nconvicted him of the firearm and ammunition possession counts.\n              The trial court sentenced Badillo to a determinate term of 21 years,\nconsisting of the upper term of six years on the firearm possession count, the middle term\nof four years on the firearm use enhancement, two five-year prison terms on prior serious\nfelony conviction enhancements (§ 667, subd. (a)) that the court found true in a\nbifurcated proceeding, and a one-year term on a prior prison term enhancement (§ 667.5,\nsubd. (b)) the court also found true. The court sentenced Badillo under the Three Strikes\nLaw to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life on the threat conviction, and entered a\nstay under section 654 on the ammunition count.\n              In Badillo’s direct appeal, the panel concluded, “Although we are troubled\nby the volume of gang evidence admitted at trial, we conclude the court did not err.”\n(Badillo, supra, at p. 2.) Our opinion explained that, under People v. Lindberg (2008)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2640351\"><a href=\"/opinion/2640351/people-v-lindberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6, “gang evidence, including expert testimony, may be admissible, even\nwhen gang offenses and enhancements are not charged, if the gang evidence is relevant to\nan issue in the case. Here, the prosecutor alleged Badillo made criminal threats because\nof Russell’s and Kaiser’s race (§ 422.75, subd. (a)). Thus, any gang evidence that tended\nto prove the hate crime allegations was relevant. In other words, evidence Rivera 13\ngang members harbor ill feelings towards African-Americans and Badillo was a\nRivera 13 gang member would be relevant because it would tend to establish Badillo\nharbored ill feelings toward African-Americans and he made the criminal threats against\nRussell and Kaiser because they were African-American.” (Badillo, at pp. 13-14.)\n\n                                            10\n\f               While the trial court conditioned admission of gang evidence on its linkage,\nif any, to Rivera 13’s alleged group bias, “the gang evidence went beyond that here,” but\n“defense counsel never objected to the prosecutor’s questions as violating the court’s\npretrial ruling.” (Badillo, supra, at pp. 14-15.) Consequently, as the concurring opinion\nexplained, no reversible error could be traced to the trial court because its rulings are\nevaluated at the time they are made, and absent an objection when “‘the evidence is\nactually offered, and the court is aware of its relevance in context, its probative value, and\nits potential for prejudice . . . , the court cannot intelligently rule on admissibility.’\nBadillo’s defense lawyer therefore had the responsibility to object if the prosecutor failed\nto provide a proper foundation for the gang evidence.” (Id., at conc., p. 2.) The panel\nagreed that Badillo’s remedy, if any, lay in a habeas petition. (Id. at p. 3; accord, id. at\np. 15 [observing that Badillo did not raise IAC in his direct appeal, “[p]erhaps . . .\nbecause [such] a claim . . . “‘“is more appropriately raised in a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus”’”].)\n                                                II\n                                         DISCUSSION\n               Badillo now asserts his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of\ncounsel by failing to object to the mountain of gang evidence admitted without any\nconnection to Rivera 13’s or Badillo’s alleged racial animus. We agree. In People v.\nAlbarran (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232, the court observed in reversing a murder\nconviction where the evidence did not support the alleged gang enhancement, “Given the\nnature and amount of this gang evidence at issue, the number of witnesses who testified\nto Albarran’s gang affiliations and the role the gang evidence played in the prosecutor’s\nargument,” the court could not conclude the gang evidence “did not contribute to the\nverdict.” Here, the sheer volume of gang evidence in this nongang case is staggering, and\nits prejudicial effect requires granting Badillo’s petition for habeas relief and an untainted\nnew trial.\n\n                                               11\n\f              The standard of review for an IAC claim is well settled. To prevail, a\ndefendant must show that counsel’s performance fell below prevailing professional\nstandards and was prejudicial. (Strickland v. Washington (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687-694\n(Strickland).) To prove prejudice, the defendant must demonstrate a “‘reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\nwould have been different.’” (People v. Ledesma (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 217-218.) “‘“A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\noutcome.’ [Citations.]”’” (People v.

Trial counsel\nhas filed an affidavit in support of Badillo’s habeas petition explaining he assumed his\npretrial objection was sufficient, but as we explained in the direct appeal, that is not the\ncase, and counsel now acknowledges as much. Simply put, “[a] tentative pretrial\nevidentiary ruling, made without fully knowing what the trial evidence would show, will\nnot preserve the issue for appeal if the appellant could have, but did not, renew the\nobjection or offer of proof and press for a final ruling in the changed context of the trial\nevidence itself. [Citations.]” (People v. Holloway (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508855\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508855/people-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133.) “One of\nthe principal tasks of a defense attorney is to attempt to protect his or her client from the\nadmission of evidence that is more prejudicial than probative” (In re Jones (1996)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581), and by failing to object to the prosecutor’s relentless stream of gang\nevidence untethered to racial animus, counsel’s performance did not meet the required\nstandard here.\n              The Attorney General does not dispute that trial counsel’s performance was\ndeficient, arguing only that Badillo has not shown prejudice “for four reasons.” First, as\nbetween the evidence that supported Russell’s version of events and the evidence\nsupporting Badillo’s claim Russell was the aggressor, the Attorney General merely\nasserts the former was more credible. But that begs the question of whether the plethora\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fof gang evidence that would not have been admitted if counsel had objected unfairly\nundermined Badillo’s credibility. We conclude it did.\n               Badillo denied pointing the rifle at Russell, but he also emphasized Russell\nwas the aggressor. While the evidence was conflicting, it was consistent with his belief\nRussell intended to seize the gun and shoot him when Badillo had not been pointing it at\nanyone. As the concurring opinion on appeal observed, the improper gang evidence had\n“disastrous consequences” for Badillo’s defense. (Supra, at p. 2.) “It seems probable the\ninflammatory gang evidence influenced the jury to reject his testimony. The jury likely\nconcluded that Badillo was the kind of person who would threaten [Russell] with a gun\nbecause he belonged to a gang that had committed at least 20 murders, maintained ties to\nthe Mexican Mafia, and its members, including Badillo, commonly carried guns to\nsupport their criminal endeavors. Indeed, it is doubtful a jury would believe anyone who\nfit this profile.” (Ibid.)\n               Second, while the Attorney General concedes Badillo’s credibility was\n“crucial to his defense, his credibility was severely undermined even without the\nadditional gang evidence.” The Attorney General points to the evidence “that petitioner\nwas a Rivera 13 gang member and that Rivera 13 and petitioner personally harbored\nracial animus toward African-Americans.” But that evidence was conflicting and slight\nin comparison to the deluge of improper gang evidence with no relation to racial animus.\nFor example, the prosecution’s evidence showing Rivera 13’s racial antagonism toward\nAfrican-Americans only occurred in a custodial setting. Lloyd admitted his opinion that\nRivera 13 gang members “disdain” African-Americans was based on his experience\n“mostly in the jail,” but as we observed in the direct appeal, “Needless to say, the\nincident here did not occur while Badillo was in custody, and a person’s institutional\nbehavior is not necessarily predictive of how that person will act while out of custody.”\n(Badillo, supra, at p. 14.) But defense counsel did not object to any of Lloyd’s\ntestimony.\n\n                                             13\n\f              The Attorney General also points to Badillo’s admission he had been to\nprison four times, including for assault with a deadly weapon and robbery, and also\nderides as “implausible” Badillo’s claim he wanted to return Phillips’s rifle. But many of\nthe witnesses had felony convictions, including Kaiser, who testified both to Badillo’s\nracial animus and to Russell’s aggressive conduct. The wife in the husband-and-wife\ncouple who were walking nearby during the altercation expressly recalled she heard\nBadillo state he was returning Phillips’ gun, while her husband’s statements were\nequivocal on whether Badillo pointed the gun at Russell. Badillo’s felony record was\nintroduced in the first trial as well, but that jury hung. The scope of the gang evidence\nmarked the only significant difference between the two trials. It was the jury’s\nprerogative to credit witness testimony, in whole or in part. Consequently, the impact of\nthe improper gang evidence on Badillo’s credibility cannot be overstated.\n              Third, the Attorney General argues that while the jury asked several\nquestions during deliberations and had the testimony of several witnesses read back, none\ninvolved the gang evidence. The Attorney General deduces from this and from the jury’s\nverdict acquitting Badillo of the threat against Kaiser and the hate-crime allegation that\nthe jury discharged its duties carefully and was not influenced by irrelevant or excessive\ngang evidence. But the jury asked six questions in the first trial and four in the second,\nand in both requested readbacks of the testimony about the confrontation, demonstrating\nthe case was a close one.\n              If the jury had quickly returned guilty verdicts, the Attorney General would\nargue it showed the evidence was so overwhelming there could be no conceivable\nprejudice. Her argument here that protracted deliberations resulting in a partial acquittal\nshowed only a thoughtful jury unswayed by prejudice is appealing in theory, but merely\nspeculative. The Attorney General points to nothing in the second trial that was absent in\nthe first trial to explain the different verdicts. We find it compelling that the jury hung in\nthe first trial without the superfluous gang evidence; indeed, a full third of the jurors\n\n                                              14\n\fbelieved Badillo was entitled to acquittal on the threat counts. These circumstances\nundermine our confidence in the jury’s second verdict. There is a reasonable probability\ncounsel’s failure to object to the irrelevant gang evidence explains the divergent\noutcomes, to Badillo’s detriment, and no more is required. (Strickland, supra, 466 U.S.\nat p. 684.)\n              Finally, the Attorney General relies on the trial court’s limiting instructions.\nOrdinarily, we presume the jury heeds the trial court’s directions, particularly instructions\nlimiting its consideration of evidence. (People v. Avila (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515784\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515784/people-v-avila/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574.) But\nan overwhelming volume of improper evidence may outweigh the trial court’s best\nintentions (Albarran, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at pp. 226-228), and our courts have long\nrecognized the particularly volatile nature of gang evidence. (People v. Hernandez\n(2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548849\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548849/people-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1049 (Hernandez); People v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342.)\n              In Cardenas, for example, the Supreme Court observed in reversing the\ndefendant’s attempted murder conviction that the “error in admitting the evidence of\ncommon membership in the Flores gang was compounded by the prosecutor’s broad\ninquiries suggesting that the gang was involved in [unrelated] criminal activities. These\nquestions made it a near certainty that the jury viewed appellant as more likely to have\ncommitted the violent offenses charged against him because of his membership in the\nFlores gang.” (Cardenas, supra, 31 Cal.3d at p. 906.) Accordingly, “[i]n cases not\ninvolving the gang enhancement,” the high court has held that gang evidence “is\npotentially prejudicial and should not be admitted if its probative value is minimal.”\n(Hernandez, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1049.)\n              Albarran is instructive. There, the trial court granted a new trial motion\nconcluding there was insufficient evidence to support the gang enhancement, but ruled\nsome gang evidence was relevant to prove motive or intent for the substantive counts,\n\n                                             15\n\fwhich included attempted murder, shooting at an inhabited dwelling and attempted\nkidnapping for carjacking. On appeal, the reviewing court held that even if some gang\nevidence were relevant on these issues, the lower court erred in admitting other extremely\ninflammatory evidence—including references to the Mexican Mafia, threats to kill police\nofficers, and descriptions of criminal activities by other gang members—that had no\nconnection to the underlying charges. (Albarran, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at pp. 226-228.)\nUnder the circumstances, rather than showing motive and intent, the gang evidence\nserved only to inflame the jury and show defendant’s dangerous and criminal disposition.\n(Id. at p. 230.)\n               Similarly here, the jury heard a great deal of prejudicial gang evidence,\nincluding as in Albarran irrelevant and ominous references to the Mexican Mafia and\nunrelated criminal offenses. The prosecutor introduced gang expert testimony on a full\nscore of gang murders and assaults, delving into Rivera 13’s asserted gang history in\nwhich its members were “almost always armed,” and declaring, “Almost every Rivera\nSouthern Hispanic will have done violence.” None of this extremely prejudicial gang\nevidence had any connection to the issue of racial animus, which the court required in its\npretrial ruling.\n               The Supreme Court has cautioned that gang evidence must be scrutinized\neven when it is relevant, due to its potentially inflammatory impact. (People v. Carter\n(2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639408\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639408/people-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1194.) That did not occur here because counsel failed to object\ndespite the trial court’s pretrial foundation requirement indicating it “would have\nexcluded most, if not all, the gang evidence that shed no light on whether the Pico\nRivera 13 gang harbored racial animus toward African-Americans or committed hate\ncrimes against them.” (Badillo, supra, conc. at p. 2.) Because the vast majority of the\nprosecutor’s gang evidence had no “bearing on whether Badillo or his gang harbored\nracial animus” (ibid.), Badillo has established the requisite prejudice for his IAC claim\nand a new trial without the improper evidence.\n\n                                             16\n\f                                             III\n                                      DISPOSITION\n              Badillo’s habeas corpus petition is granted.
