He also claims\nthat the same officers’ harassment had caused him to refrain\nfrom praying while at work. Mack brought this lawsuit pro\nse against various prison employees seeking monetary relief\nfor alleged violations of his rights under the First\nAmendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Religious Freedom\nand Restoration Act (“RFRA”). The District Court dismissed\nall of Mack’s claims.\n\n      Mack’s allegations raise several issues of first\nimpression in our Circuit, including (1) whether an inmate’s\n\n\n\n\n                             3\n\foral grievance to prison officials can constitute protected\nactivity under the Constitution; (2) whether RFRA prohibits\nindividual conduct that substantially burdens religious\nexercise; and (3) whether RFRA provides for monetary relief\nfrom an official sued in his individual capacity. We answer\nall three questions in the affirmative, and therefore conclude\nthat Mack has sufficiently pled a First Amendment retaliation\nclaim and a RFRA claim. We agree, however, that Mack’s\nFirst Amendment Free Exercise claim and Fifth Amendment\nequal protection claim must be dismissed. We will therefore\naffirm in part, vacate in part, and remand to the District Court\nfor further proceedings.\nI.      BACKGROUND\n\n     A.    Mack’s Allegations of Anti-Muslim\nHarassment\n\n        Mack’s pro se complaint includes the following\nallegations, which we assume are true for purposes of this\nappeal.2 Mack is an inmate at the Federal Correctional\nInstitution in Loretto, Pennsylvania (“FCI Loretto”). He\nworked for pay in the prison’s commissary from\napproximately May 2009 until he was terminated in October\n\n2\n  Finkelman v. Nat’l Football League, 810 F.3d 187, 190 n.11\n(3d Cir. 2016). Because Mack proceeded pro se up until this\nappeal, we will also consider his allegations made in response\nto the defendants’ motion to dismiss, which incorporate and\nare consistent with the allegations in his complaint. See\nHughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 9-10 & n.8 (1980) (per curiam)\n(considering pro se plaintiff’s amended complaint and\nresponse to the defendants’ motion to dismiss to conclude that\nplaintiff sufficiently stated a claim).\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f2009. His job responsibilities included stocking shelves,\nfilling inmate commissary orders, and cleaning the work area.\nAs a practicing Muslim, Mack was provided certain religious\naccommodations at work. For example, Mack did not have to\nhandle pork products at the commissary, he was provided a\nsuitable area in which he could pray during breaks, and he\nwas permitted to attend religious services on Friday.3\nDefendants Doug Roberts and Samuel Venslosky are\ncorrectional officers at FCI Loretto who were assigned to\nsupervise the commissary at the time Mack worked there.\nThey were responsible for the safety and security of the\ninmates and the orderly operation of the commissary.\n\n        While Mack was at work one day, Officer Roberts\nwalked up behind him and slapped him hard on the back.\nMack asked Roberts why he had hit him, to which Roberts\nresponded, “do you have a problem with what I did?”4 Mack\nsaid “yes,” and Roberts declared, “you’ll be looking for\nanother job soon!”5 Officer Venslosky and other inmates\nwitnessed this interaction and laughed. The officers and\ninmates continued to laugh and snicker at Mack throughout\nhis shift. When Mack finished work and left the commissary,\na fellow inmate informed him that he had an “I LOVE\nBACON” sticker affixed to the back of his shirt. Roberts\n\n3\n  See, e.g., Williams v. Bitner, 455 F.3d 186, 191-92 & n.6 (3d\nCir. 2006) (recognizing that practicing Muslims do not handle\npork); Williams v. Morton, 343 F.3d 212, 219 (3d Cir. 2003)\n(recognizing that practicing Muslims pray five times each\nday).\n4\n    Am. Compl. (J.A. Vol. II 56-62) ¶ 14.\n5\n    Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fknew that Mack is Muslim and that Islam forbids the\nhandling and consumption of pork. The next day, Mack\nasked Roberts why he had slapped the offensive sticker on his\nback. Roberts asked Mack if he had a problem with that, and\nthen declared again, “don’t worry you’ll be looking for\nanother job soon!”6 A few days later, while Mack was at\nwork, Roberts loudly told Mack in the presence of Venslosky\nand other inmates that “there is no good Muslim, except a\ndead Muslim!”7 Venslosky and other inmates heard this\ncomment and laughed.\n\n       Mack claims that the officers’ anti-Muslim harassment\nand animus created a tense work environment and caused him\nto fear that he could be harmed at work because of his\nreligious beliefs. He “continued his work assignment very\ncarefully and nervously[,] not knowing whether an inmate\ncommissary worker [might] act out on Defendant Roberts[’]\nstatement and attempt to physically harm [him] for being\nMuslim.”8 While Mack was permitted to pray at work, the\nofficers’ conduct “created a threatening [and] hostile\nenvironment, that literally caused [him] to change his\nbehavior in that [he] would no longer pray in that area, and\nwould wait until he got off work.”9\n\n\n\n\n6\n    Id. ¶ 17.\n7\n    Id. ¶ 18.\n8\n    Compl. (J.A. Vol. II 33-43) ¶ 35.\n9\n Mack v. Yost, No. 3:10-cv-264, ECF No. 42 (Pl. Mem. in\nOpp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss), at 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\f          B.     Mack’s Complaints to Prison Staff\n\n       Seeking redress, Mack spoke with Jeff Stephens, who\nwas Roberts’ and Venslosky’s supervisor.10 Mack orally\ncomplained to Stephens about Roberts’ anti-Muslim conduct\nand statements, and about Venslosky’s inaction during both\nincidents. Stephens agreed to “look into it.”11 Approximately\none week later, Venslosky told Mack that he was being fired\nfrom his commissary position for “bringing in other inmates’\ncommissary slips.”12 Mack replied that this was untrue, and\nthat the only reason he was being fired was because he had\ncomplained to Stephens. Venslosky did not respond.\n\n       Convinced that Venslosky’s reason for firing him was\na sham, Mack located Stephens during his lunch period and\norally complained to him about his termination. Stephens\nagain responded that he would look into it. When nothing\ncame of that, Mack filed an inmate request-to-staff form\nseeking an explanation in writing for his termination.\nStephens provided Mack with a written response from\nVenslosky asserting that Mack was “caught bringing slips in\nfor inmates.”13 Mack then orally complained to the Warden,\nJohn Yost, during his next lunch period. The Warden\n\n\n10\n     Am. Compl. ¶¶ 4, 21.\n11\n     Id. ¶ 21.\n12\n   Id. ¶ 22. It is unclear from the record what “bringing in\nother inmates’ commissary slips” means and why it is a\npunishable offense. For purposes of this appeal, this\nambiguity is irrelevant.\n13\n     Id. ¶ 26.\n\n\n\n\n                               7\n\fresponded, “[w]hat do you expect me to do?”14 Finally,\nMack filed a formal grievance. Deputy Warden Tim Kuhn\nrepeated the same reason for Mack’s termination in his\nresponse to Mack’s formal grievance. Mack then filed this\nfederal lawsuit.\n\n          C.     Procedural History\n\n        Mack filed suit pro se against Roberts, Venslosky,\nStephens, Warden Yost, and Deputy Warden Kuhn for\nalleged constitutional violations pursuant to Bivens v. Six\nUnknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of\nNarcotics,15 and for violations of the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (“RLUIPA”).16 Among\nother things, Mack alleged that the defendants violated his\nrights under the Petition Clause of the First Amendment,\nwhich protects “the right of the people . . . to petition the\nGovernment for a redress of grievances.”17 In particular,\nMack claimed that he was retaliated against for seeking to\nredress his grievances, that is, for orally complaining to\nStephens about Roberts’ and Venslosky’s anti-Muslim\nconduct.\n\n       The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure\nto state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n14\n     Id. ¶ 28.\n15\n   403 U.S. 388 (1971) (recognizing an implied private right\nof action for damages against federal officials alleged to have\nviolated a person’s constitutional rights).\n16\n     42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc et seq.\n17\n     U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                    8\n\f12(b)(6). Mack appealed, and this Court vacated and\nremanded.18 We directed the District Court to consider in the\nfirst instance whether an inmate’s oral complaint to prison\nstaff constitutes protected activity under the First\nAmendment’s right to petition.19 We noted that “[f]iling a\nformal prison grievance clearly constitutes protected\nactivity,” but acknowledged that “certain informal, oral\ncomplaints to prison personnel have been held to constitute\nprotected activity as well.”20 We also explained that Mack’s\nallegations “clearly invite inquiry into” whether the\ndefendants violated Mack’s “First Amendment right to\npractice as a Muslim,” and that Mack’s claims should not\nhave been dismissed without leave to amend.21\n\n        At the direction of the District Court, Mack filed an\namended complaint, which largely tracks his original\ncomplaint. Construed liberally, Mack’s amended complaint\nraises three constitutional claims and one statutory claim: (1)\nFirst Amendment retaliation, invoking the Petition Clause; (2)\nFirst Amendment Free Exercise Clause violation; (3) Fifth\nAmendment equal protection violation; and (4) Religious\nFreedom and Restoration Act violation.22 From Roberts and\n\n18\n     Mack v. Yost, 427 F. App’x 70 (3d Cir. 2011).\n19\n     Id. at 72.\n20\n     Id.\n21\n     Id. at 73.\n22\n  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a). The District Court properly\nconstrued Mack’s claim under RLUIPA, which does not\napply to federal government actions, as a claim under RFRA,\nwhich does. See Mack v. Yost, 979 F. Supp. 2d 639, 650\n(W.D. Pa. 2013) (“Because provisions under the RFRA are\n\n\n\n\n                                9\n\fVenslosky only, Mack seeks back pay plus interest for each\nmonth since he was removed from his commissary position.\nHe seeks from all defendants $75,000 each in punitive\ndamages.23\n        The District Court dismissed Mack’s amended\ncomplaint, too, for failure to state a claim under Rule\n12(b)(6). Addressing Mack’s First Amendment retaliation\nclaim, the District Court held that “[a]n oral complaint to a\nprison guard is not a petitioning for the redress of grievances\nguaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.”24 The\nCourt accordingly dismissed this claim, reasoning that Mack\n“had not filed a petition with an administrative agency,\nwhether by formal or informal means,” until after the alleged\nretaliation occurred.25 The District Court also rejected\nMack’s equal protection claim because Mack had not\nidentified any similarly situated individuals whom prison\nofficials treated differently.26 As for Mack’s Free Exercise\nand RFRA claims, which the District Court construed as\n“potential” claims, the District Court held that the defendants\nneither intentionally nor substantially burdened Mack’s\n\n‘nearly identical’ to those under the RLUIPA, the Court will\naddress whether Mack can assert an actionable RFRA claim.”\n(internal citations omitted)).\n23\n  Mack sued Stephens, Yost, and Kuhn for damages in both\ntheir individual and official capacities. He has conceded,\nhowever, that federal sovereign immunity precludes him from\nsuing the officers for damages in their official capacities.\nMack, No. 3:10-cv-264, ECF No. 42, at 12.\n24\n     Mack, 979 F. Supp. 2d at 648.\n25\n     Id.\n26\n     Id. at 646-47.\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\freligious exercise, and it accordingly dismissed these claims\nas well.27\n\n       Mack moved for reconsideration under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 59(e). The District Court denied that motion,\nand Mack appealed. This Court then appointed pro bono\ncounsel to represent Mack.28\n\n\n\n\n27\n     Id. at 650-52.\n28\n   We extend our gratitude to the Duke University law\nstudents who have done a commendable job representing\nMack on appeal. We also applaud Mr. Russell Taylor for his\nimpressive performance representing Mack at oral argument.\n\n\n\n\n                             11\n\fII.   DISCUSSION29\n\n        There are many layers to this case. First, we will\ndiscuss Mack’s First Amendment retaliation claim and the\nGovernment’s corresponding defenses. With respect to this\nclaim, we conclude that Mack has alleged sufficient facts to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss and that the defendants are not\nentitled to qualified immunity at this juncture. We will\ndismiss this claim, however, as to Defendants Yost and Kuhn.\n\n       Second, we will discuss Mack’s RFRA claim. We\nconclude that (i) Mack can properly bring this claim against\nprison officers for their individual conduct, (ii) he can seek\nmonetary damages from the officers, and (iii) his allegations\nsufficiently allege a substantial burden on his religious\nexercise.\n\n\n\n\n29\n  The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de\nnovo a district court’s decision dismissing a complaint.\nFinkelman, 810 F.3d at 192. We note that “the standards of\nreview for an underlying dismissal order and for the denial of\na motion for reconsideration of the dismissal order are\nfunctionally equivalent, because we exercise plenary review\nof the dismissal order as well as of the legal questions in the\ndenial of reconsideration.” Wiest v. Lynch, 710 F.3d 121, 128\n(3d Cir. 2013).\n\n\n\n\n                              12\n\f      Third, we will turn to Mack’s claim under the Free\nExercise Clause. We conclude that there is no available\nremedy for Mack under this claim and we will accordingly\ndismiss it.\n\n       Finally, we will discuss Mack’s equal protection claim.\nWe conclude that this claim is insufficient to survive a motion\nto dismiss.\n\n       A.     First Amendment Retaliation Claim\n\n           i.     Mack’s First Amendment Retaliation\nClaim Against Warden Yost and Deputy Warden Kuhn\nMust Be Dismissed\n\n        Mack claims that he was retaliated against for orally\ncomplaining to Stephens about Roberts’ and Venslosky’s\nconduct. While Mack brings this claim against Warden Yost\nand Deputy Warden Kuhn as well, his complaint makes it\nclear that he only spoke to these defendants after the alleged\nretaliation occurred. There is nothing alleged from which we\ncan infer that Yost and Kuhn were personally involved in any\npurported retaliation. Because plaintiffs in a Bivens suit\n“must plead that each Government-official defendant, through\nthe official’s own individual actions, has violated the\nConstitution,”30 Mack’s First Amendment retaliation claim\nagainst Yost and Kuhn must be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n30\n  Bistrian v. Levi, 696 F.3d 352, 366 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 676 (2009)).\n\n\n\n\n                              13\n\f             ii.  Mack Properly Exhausted His\nAdministrative Remedies as to His First Amendment\nRetaliation Claim\n\n        The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) requires\nprisoners to exhaust any and all prison grievance remedies\nbefore filing suit in federal court.31 “Failure to exhaust is an\naffirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.”32\nThe Government contends that Mack’s First Amendment\nretaliation claim must be dismissed because Mack did not\nexhaust his administrative remedies. It concedes that Mack\ndescribed in his formal grievance much of the alleged\nwrongdoing in this case. Nevertheless, it argues that because\nMack’s grievance never mentioned his oral complaint to\nStephens about Roberts’ and Venslosky’s anti-Muslim\nconduct—the alleged protected speech that forms the basis of\nhis retaliation claim—this claim was not properly exhausted.\nWe find this argument unconvincing.\n\n       Under the PLRA, a grievance must be described in a\nlevel of detail sufficient to satisfy the prison’s standards.33\nThe Government describes the Bureau of Prison’s (“BOP”)\nprocedures as “silent or vague” regarding the level of detail\nrequired in a grievance.34 When this is the case, an inmate’s\n\n31\n     42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n32\n     Small v. Camden Cty., 728 F.3d 265, 268 (3d Cir. 2013).\n33\n  See Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 (2007) (“The level of\ndetail necessary in a grievance to comply with the grievance\nprocedures will vary . . . but it is the prison’s requirements . . .\nthat define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.”).\n34\n     Gov’t Br. 15.\n\n\n\n\n                                14\n\fgrievance must at least “alert[] the prison to the nature of the\nwrong for which redress is sought.”35 As the Supreme Court\nhas explained, “the primary purpose of a grievance is to alert\nprison officials to a problem.”36 We think Mack did just that.\n\n       Before beginning the formal grievance process, Mack\nsubmitted a form requesting a written reason for his\ntermination. In his formal grievance, Mack claimed that the\nresponse to his request was vague, and that he was “fired\nfrom [his] job for no reason.”37 He went on to explain the\nanti-Muslim harassment he endured at work. When his\ngrievance was rejected, Mack explained in his appeal that the\nprison’s proffered explanation for his termination was a\n“cover-up attempt.”38 He claimed that he was fired from his\njob for “NO real reason related to [his] work.”39\n\n       Mack clearly alerted prison officials to his principal\nallegation – i.e., that he was removed from his commissary\nposition for a pretextual reason. Even if Mack did not detail\nhis allegedly protected speech, his grievance nonetheless\nnotified officials that he believed he was unlawfully\nterminated from his work assignment as retaliation for\nexercising his First Amendment rights. Exhaustion merely\nrequires “inmates [to] provide enough information about the\nconduct of which they complain to allow prison officials to\n\n35\n     Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646, 650 (7th Cir. 2002).\n36\n     Jones, 549 U.S. at 219.\n37\n   Mack v. Yost, No. 3:10-cv-264, ECF No. 38-3 (Defs.’ Mot.\nto Dismiss Am. Compl.), Ex. 1b, at 2.\n38\n     Id. at 8.\n39\n     Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\ftake appropriate responsive measures.”40 Given this fairly\nlenient standard, and with no specific guidance from BOP\ngrievance procedures, we conclude that Mack exhausted his\nadministrative remedies before bringing his First Amendment\nretaliation claim.\n\n           iii.  A Bivens Action Exists for Mack’s\nFirst Amendment Retaliation Claim\n\n       The Government next argues that Mack cannot bring a\nFirst Amendment retaliation claim under Bivens. In Bivens,\nthe Supreme Court “recognized for the first time an implied\nprivate action for damages against federal officers alleged to\nhave violated a citizen’s [Fourth Amendment] rights.”41\nThus, a Bivens action is a private cause of action for money\ndamages implied directly from the Constitution.

La Prade,45 we held that a Bivens action\nmay be implied directly from the First Amendment.46\nRelying on this general principle, we held in Milhouse v.\nCarlson47 that a Bivens action was available to an inmate who\nwas harassed and transferred to a less desirable prison cell\n\n43\n  See Reichle v.

Our precedents make clear that, in this\ncontext, a Bivens action is already available.\n\n            iv.    Mack’s Oral Complaint to Stephens\nwas Constitutionally Protected\n\n       We next address whether Mack has sufficiently\npleaded a First Amendment retaliation claim. “A prisoner\nalleging retaliation must show (1) constitutionally protected\nconduct, (2) an adverse action taken by prison officials\nsufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from\nexercising his constitutional rights, and (3) a causal link\nbetween the exercise of his constitutional rights and the\n\n\n48\n     Id. at 373-74.\n49\n     Id. at 373.\n50\n     Id. at 374.\n51\n     318 F.3d 523 (3d Cir. 2003).\n52\n     Id. at 530-31.\n\n\n\n\n                               18\n\fadverse action taken against him.”53 The previous panel of\nthis Court to address Mack’s retaliation claim found the latter\ntwo elements satisfied: adverse action in the form of loss of\nemployment, and a causal connection because Mack claims\nhe was fired one week after engaging in the allegedly\nprotected conduct.54 The panel remanded to the District\nCourt to determine whether Mack’s oral grievance to\nStephens was constitutionally protected under the Petition\nClause, and the District Court held that it was not. We\ndisagree.\n\n       The Petition Clause embraces a broad range of\ncommunications, and the availability of its protections has\nnever turned on a perceived distinction between written and\noral speech.55 Both the Free Speech Clause and the Petition\nClause protect “personal expression” – both expression\ngenerally and expression directed towards the government for\nthe specific purpose of asking it to right a wrong.56 In this\ncontext, form is secondary to content.\n\n53\n   Id. at 530 (internal quotation marks omitted and\npunctuation modified).\n54\n     Mack, 427 F. App’x at 72-73.\n55\n  See, e.g., Pearson v. Welborn, 471 F.3d 732, 741 (7th Cir.\n2006) (“Nothing in the First Amendment itself suggests that\nthe right to petition for redress of grievances only attaches\nwhen the petitioning takes a certain form.”).\n56\n  See Borough of Duryea, Pa. v. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. 379,\n388 (2011) (“Beyond the political sphere, both speech and\npetition advance personal expression, although the right to\npetition is generally concerned with expression directed to the\ngovernment seeking redress of a grievance.”).\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\f       The Government concedes that some informal, oral,\nand even non-verbal expressions of grievances to the\ngovernment are protected under the Petition Clause.57 It\nargues, however, that an oral grievance lodged by a prisoner,\nin particular, should not be entitled to constitutional\nprotection. The Government stresses that prison is a unique\nsetting in which inmates and guards are in constant and often\ncontentious contact with each other. In its view, holding that\nevery oral complaint by a prisoner to a prison guard is\nconstitutionally protected would provide too many\nopportunities for prisoners to lodge frivolous lawsuits.\n\n       While we appreciate the Government’s concerns, we\nare not persuaded that an oral grievance should not receive\nconstitutional protection solely because it is lodged by a\nprisoner as opposed to a civilian. It is well-established that\ninmates do not relinquish their First Amendment right to\npetition by virtue of being incarcerated.58 It is also true, as\nthe Government emphasizes, that an inmate only “retains\nthose First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with\n\n57\n   See, e.g., NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S.\n886, 909 (1982) (boycott of merchants was protected activity\nunder Petition Clause); Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131,\n136 (1966) (silent protest at racially segregated library was\nprotected activity under Petition Clause); Edwards v. South\nCarolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235 (1963) (peaceful march and\ndemonstrations were protected activity under Petition\nClause); Holzemer v. City of Memphis, 621 F.3d 512, 520-23\n(6th Cir. 2010) (business owner’s oral, informal request to\ncity councilman regarding his company’s ability to park at\ncity venue was protected activity under Petition Clause).\n58\n     See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987).\n\n\n\n\n                                20\n\fhis status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological\nobjectives of the corrections system.”59 But under the facts\nalleged, there is no reason for us to think that the First\nAmendment rights Mack seeks to vindicate here are\nincompatible with his status as a prisoner.\n\n        Mack’s allegations make clear that he complained to\nStephens for the specific purpose of seeking redress. His\ncomplaint concerned a prison guard’s conduct that the prison\nitself proscribes—religious harassment.60 His complaint was\nnot obscene or inappropriate. In fact, the Government\nconcedes that Mack’s oral grievance was “minimally\ndisruptive and arguably valuable.”61 And Mack complained\nalmost immediately after the harassment occurred,\nundermining any contention that Mack formulated some sort\nof plan to lodge a complaint in order to bring a frivolous\nlawsuit. In short, Mack’s oral grievance sufficiently and\ntimely put prison officials on notice that he was seeking\nredress, was conveyed to prison officials in a reasonable\nmanner, and concerned conduct that the prison itself\nprohibits. Under the circumstances of this case, these factors\nlead us to conclude that Mack’s oral grievance is entitled to\nconstitutional protection.\n\n       Significantly, moreover, prison officials at FCI Loretto\nmay have actually encouraged inmates to communicate their\nconcerns orally. BOP procedures require inmates to present\nan issue “informally to staff” before filing a formal grievance,\n\n59\n     Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974).\n60\n     See 28 C.F.R. § 548.15.\n61\n     Gov’t Br. 25.\n\n\n\n\n                                21\n\fand require wardens to “establish procedures to allow for the\ninformal resolution of inmate complaints.”62 FCI Loretto’s\ninmate handbook explains that, “Executive Staff and\nDepartment Heads regularly stand mainline at the lunch meal\nand you are encouraged to bring legitimate concerns to their\nattention.”63 We can reasonably assume that this is why\nMack approached Stephens and Yost in person during his\nlunch hour. It would be illogical to allow prison officials to\nretaliate against Mack for his oral complaint if FCI Loretto\nencourages the type of informal resolution that Mack\nattempted.\n\n        To our knowledge, only one other circuit has\naddressed this specific issue. In Pearson v. Welborn,64 the\nSeventh Circuit held that an inmate’s oral complaints to\nprison guards about the use of shackles in group therapy and\nthe denial of yard time were constitutionally protected under\nthe Petition Clause.65 The court explained that “[n]othing in\nthe First Amendment itself suggests that the right to petition\nfor redress of grievances only attaches when the petitioning\ntakes a specific form.”66 And while “certain types of\n‘petitioning’ would be obviously inconsistent with\n\n62\n     See 28 C.F.R. 542.13(a).\n63\n  U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Fed.

We find the Seventh Circuit’s rationale to readily\napply to the circumstances of this case.68\n\n       For these reasons, we conclude that Mack’s oral\ngrievance to Stephens regarding the anti-Muslim harassment\nhe endured at work constitutes protected activity under the\nFirst Amendment.69\n\n\n67\n     Id.\n68\n   See also Williams v. Wahner, 731 F.3d 731, 734 (7th Cir.\n2013) (“Many prisoners can explain themselves orally but not\nin writing. They may be illiterate in English, or they may\nsimply be such poor writers that they can’t convey their\nthoughts other than orally.”).\n69\n   The Government urges us to impose a public concern\nrequirement on oral grievances in the prisoner-work context.\nIn the public employment context, public employees who\nassert First Amendment free speech or right to petition claims\nagainst their government employers must show that their\nspeech addressed a matter of public concern. See Connick v.\nMyers, 461 U.S. 138, 145-48 (1983); Guarnieri, 564 U.S. at\n398-99. We have explicitly stated, however, that the rationale\nfor the public/private concern distinction in the public\nemployment context does not apply in other contexts,\nincluding prison settings. Eichenlaub v. Twp. of Indiana, 385\nF.3d 274, 284 (3d Cir. 2004). Several other circuits have held\nthe same. See, e.g., Watkins v. Kasper, 599 F.3d 791, 795\n(7th Cir. 2010); Friedl v. City of New York, 210 F.3d 79, 87\n(2d Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                              23\n\f             v.    Roberts, Venslosky, and Stephens are\nNot Entitled to Qualified Immunity\n\n        The remaining question we must answer with respect\nto Mack’s First Amendment retaliation claim is whether\nRoberts, Venslosky, and Stephens are entitled to qualified\nimmunity.70 “[G]overnment officials performing discretionary\nfunctions generally are shielded from liability for civil\ndamages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a\nreasonable person would have known.”71 To be clearly\nestablished, “[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently\nclear that a reasonable official would understand that what he\nis doing violates that right.”72 “The dispositive question is\nwhether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly\nestablished.”73 That is not to say that qualified immunity\napplies “unless the very action in question has previously\nbeen held unlawful,” only that “in light of pre-existing law\nthe unlawfulness must be apparent.”74\n\n\n\n70\n   Because the District Court found no First Amendment\nretaliation violation, it did not address whether the officers\nwere entitled to qualified immunity. As this issue is purely a\nquestion of law at this stage, we address it in the first\ninstance.\n71\n     Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).\n72\n     Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).\n73\n   Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S.

Indeed, “[r]etaliating against a prisoner for\nthe exercise of [any of] his constitutional rights is\nunconstitutional.”75     Retaliatory termination is clearly\nunlawful, both inside and outside the prison context.76 The\nfact that the officers retaliated against Mack before he\nreduced his grievance to writing is inconsequential. While\nwe have never held before today that a prisoner’s oral\ngrievance, in particular, is constitutionally protected, we have\ncertainly never suggested that such a grievance is entitled to\nlower protection than one reduced to writing. And there are\nmyriad cases outside the prison context that make no\ndistinction between oral and written grievances.77 Thus we\nhave little doubt concluding that prisoners’ oral grievances\nare indeed entitled to constitutional protection. A reasonable\nofficial in the prison officers’ position should therefore have\nknown that retaliating against Mack for exercising his right to\npetition, whether in the form of an oral or written grievance,\nwas unlawful.78 This is especially so if the prison actually\nencourages its inmates to communicate their concerns orally.\n\n75\n     Bistrian, 696 F.3d at 376.\n76\n   Although prisoners have no liberty or property interest in\nprison employment, James v. Quinlan, 866 F.2d 627, 629-30\n(3d Cir. 1989), it is unlawful to terminate a prisoner’s\nemployment in retaliation for them having exercised a\nconstitutional right, see Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, 333\n(3d Cir. 2001).\n77\n     See supra note 57.\n78\n   See, e.g., Holzemer, 621 F.3d at 529 (“[N]o reasonable\nofficer could believe that retaliation for the exercise of a First\n\n\n\n\n                                  25\n\f       Because we conclude that Mack has sufficiently stated\na First Amendment retaliation claim, and that the remaining\ndefendants are not entitled to qualified immunity, we will\nvacate the District Court’s dismissal of this claim and remand\nto the District Court for further proceedings.\n\n         B.    Religious Freedom and Restoration Act\nClaim\n\n       We next address Mack’s claim that the prison officers’\nanti-Muslim conduct violated RFRA, which prohibits the\ngovernment from “substantially burden[ing] a person’s\nexercise of religion.”79 Mack brings this claim against only\nOfficers Roberts and Venslosky in their individual capacities.\nHe alleges that their anti-Muslim harassment and hostility\ntowards him caused him to refrain from praying at work.\nThese allegations are sufficient to state a claim under RFRA.\n\n               i.     RFRA’s Remedial Scope\n\n       Mack’s claim raises two threshold questions: (1)\nwhether RFRA is the appropriate vehicle for relief when the\nchallenged government action is an official’s individual\nconduct, as opposed to a law, regulation, or policy, or conduct\npursuant to such; and (2) whether RFRA allows a litigant to\n\nAmendment right is permitted when that exercise takes the\nform of speech but is not permitted when the same expression\nis written.”); Pearson, 471 F.3d at 742 (“[W]e think a\nreasonable public official in [the defendant’s] position would\nunderstand that retaliating against a prisoner on the basis of\nhis [oral] complaints about prison conditions is unlawful.”).\n79\n     42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                26\n\fsue a government official for money damages. We answer\nboth questions in the affirmative.\n\n       Congress enacted RFRA “in order to provide very\nbroad protection for religious liberty.”80 RFRA prohibits the\n“Government” from “substantially burden[ing] a person’s\nexercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of\ngeneral applicability,” unless the “Government” can\n“demonstrate[] that application of the burden to the person—\n(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest;\nand (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that\ncompelling governmental interest.”81 The statute explicitly\nprovides a private cause of action against the “government”\nfor “appropriate relief.”82 “Government” is defined as\n“includ[ing] a branch, department, agency, instrumentality,\nand official (or other person acting under color of law) of the\nUnited States.”83\n\n        The plain language of RFRA establishes that a plaintiff\nmay bring claims for “appropriate relief” against “persons,”\neither federal “officials” or those acting under color of federal\nlaw, whose individual conduct substantially burdens one’s\nreligious exercise. Nothing in the text of RFRA suggests that\nthe “official” or “person” must be acting in furtherance of an\nofficial policy. This interpretation is consistent with the\n\n\n80\n  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2760\n(2014).\n81\n     42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a)-(b).\n82\n     Id. § 2000bb-1(c).\n83\n     Id. § 2000bb-2(1) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                               27\n\fSupreme Court’s view of RFRA’s “[s]weeping coverage.”84\nAccording to the Court, RFRA “intru[des] at every level of\ngovernment, displacing laws and prohibiting official actions\nof almost every description and regardless of subject matter,”\nand its restrictions apply to “every agency and official of the\nFederal Government[].”85\n\n       Our conclusion that RFRA permits suits against\nindividual officers for their ultra vires acts is reinforced by\nthe similarities between RFRA and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nSection 1983 creates a private cause of action against\n“person[s]” acting “under color of [state law]” whose\nindividual conduct violates a plaintiff’s constitutional rights.86\nUnder § 1983, state officials or private persons acting under\ncolor of state law may be held liable for their personal\nunlawful conduct, irrespective of the existence or non-\nexistence of an unconstitutional law, regulation, or policy.\nBecause RFRA’s definition of “government” tracks the\nlanguage of § 1983, it is reasonable to assume that liability\ncan be imposed similarly under both statutes. Indeed, several\nof our sister circuits have concluded that this word choice was\nnot coincidental and that Congress intended for courts to\nborrow concepts from § 1983 jurisprudence when construing\n\n\n\n\n84\n     City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 532 (1997).\n85\n  Id. In fact, it is this “sweeping coverage” that led the Court\nto invalidate RFRA as applied to the states for exceeding\nCongress’s enforcement power under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Id. at 532-34.\n86\n     42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n\n\n\n                                28\n\fRFRA.87 As the Ninth Circuit has explained, “[w]hen a\nlegislature borrows an already judicially interpreted phrase\nfrom an old statute to use in a new statute, it is presumed that\nthe legislature intends to adopt not merely the old phrase but\nthe judicial construction of that phrase.”88 Under this\npresumption, RFRA, like § 1983, provides for relief from\nindividual government conduct whether or not it is\nundertaken pursuant to an official rule or policy. Thus,\ncontrary to the Government’s contentions, Mack’s failure to\nchallenge a prison policy or regulation does not defeat his\nRFRA claim.\n\n     We also read RFRA as providing for monetary relief\nfrom officers who commit unlawful conduct.89 Under\n\n87\n    See, e.g., Listecki v. Official Comm. of Unsecured\nCreditors, 780 F.3d 731, 738 (7th Cir. 2015), cert. dismissed,\n136 S. Ct. 581 (2015) (applying § 1983 “under color of” law\nanalysis to determine whether private defendant was the\n“government” for purposes of RFRA); Sutton v. Providence\nSt. Joseph Med. Ctr., 192 F.3d 826, 834-35 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(same).\n88\n   Sutton, 192 F.3d at 834-35 (quoting Long v. Director,\nOffice of Workers’ Comp. Programs, 767 F.2d 1578, 1581\n(9th Cir. 1985)).\n89\n   Although we have never held before today that damages\nsuits are available under RFRA, we and several other circuits\nhave assumed this to be the case. See, e.g., Jama v. Esmor\nCorr. Servs., Inc., 577 F.3d 169, 174 (3d Cir. 2009)\n(assuming RFRA damages were available against corporate\nand individual defendants when reviewing attorney fee\naward); Mack v. O’Leary, 80 F.3d 1175, 1177 (7th Cir. 1996),\ncert. granted, judgment vacated on other grounds, 522 U.S.\n\n\n\n\n                              29\n\fRFRA’s judicial relief provision, persons whose religious\nexercise has been substantially burdened by the government\nmay “obtain appropriate relief against a government.”90 The\nstatute does not define “appropriate relief.” Hence we look to\nthe traditional presumption articulated in Franklin v.\nGwinnett County Public Schools91 that “any appropriate\nrelief” is available unless Congress expressly indicates\notherwise.92\n\n\n\n\n801, district court partially aff’d, 1998 WL 416151 (7th Cir.\n1998) (assuming that prisoner was entitled to sue prison\nofficials for damages under RFRA because the statute defines\n“government” to include government employees); Brown v.\nHot, Sexy and Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 538 (1st Cir.\n1995), abrogation on other grounds recognized by Martinez\nv. Cui, 608 F.3d 54, 63-64 (1st Cir. 2010) (assuming that\ndamages were available under RFRA in concluding that\nRFRA does not apply retroactively to plaintiffs’ claim for\ndamages).\n90\n     42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c).\n91\n     503 U.S. 60 (1992).\n92\n  Because Mack brings his RFRA claim against only Officers\nRoberts and Venslosky in their individual capacities, the\nfederal government’s sovereign immunity to suits for\ndamages is irrelevant here. Cf. Davila v. Gladden, 777 F.3d\n1198, 1210 (11th Cir. 2015), cert. denied sub nom. Davila v.\nHaynes, 136 S. Ct. 78 (2015) (“Congress did not\nunequivocally waive its sovereign immunity in passing\nRFRA. RFRA does not therefore authorize suits for money\ndamages against officers in their official capacities.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                30\n\f       In Franklin, the Supreme Court considered whether\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which the\nCourt previously held creates an implied right of action,\nprovides for damages relief.         The Court applied the\nlongstanding presumption that, “absent clear direction to the\ncontrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to\naward any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action\nbrought pursuant to a federal statute.”93 “Finding no express\ncongressional intent to limit the remedies available under the\nimplied right of action, the Court held that compensatory\ndamages were available” under Title IX.94\n\n       The same presumption applies here – more so, we\nthink, because Congress expressly stated that a claimant may\nobtain “appropriate relief” against the government – the exact\nlanguage used in Franklin. Congress enacted RFRA one year\nafter Franklin was decided and was therefore well aware that\n“appropriate relief” means what it says, and that, without\nexpressly stating otherwise, all appropriate relief would be\navailable.95 Of course, the relief has to be appropriate vis-à-\nvis the purposes of the statute.

Texas, 563 U.S. 277, 288 (2011) (citing\nFranklin, 503 U.S. at 73).\n95\n   See Availability of Money Damages Under the Religious\nFreedom and Restoration Act, 18 Op. O.L.C. 180, 183 (1994)\n(“Because RFRA’s reference to ‘appropriate relief’ does not\nclearly exclude money damages, there is a strong argument\nthat under the Franklin standard money damages should be\nmade available to RFRA plaintiffs in suits against non-\nsovereign entities.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                31\n\fpurposes of RFRA are to provide broad religious liberty\nprotections. We see no reason why a suit for money damages\nagainst a government official whose conduct violates RFRA\nwould be inconsistent with those purposes.\n\n        Our conclusion is bolstered, again, by the similarities\nbetween RFRA and § 1983, which has long provided for\nmoney damages against state officials sued in their individual\ncapacities.96 We are unmoved, however, by the similarities in\nthe text of RFRA and its sister statute, RLUIPA, which we\nhave held does not provide for damages against state officials\nsued in their individual capacities.97 Although the judicial\nrelief provision in RLUIPA mirrors that in RFRA,98 RLUIPA\nwas enacted pursuant to Congress’s powers under the\nSpending Clause, thereby allowing Congress to impose\ncertain conditions, such as civil liability, on the recipients of\nfederal funds, such as state prison institutions.99 Because\nstate officials are not direct recipients of the federal funds,\nand thus would have no notice of the conditions imposed on\nthem, they cannot be held individually liable under\nRLUIPA.100 RFRA, by contrast, was enacted pursuant to\n\n\n\n96\n   United States ex rel. Jones v. Rundle, 453 F.2d 147, 150\nn.11 (3d Cir. 1971) (“Money damages may constitute\nappropriate relief in Section 1983 cases.” (citing Monroe v.\nPape, 365 U.S. 163, 187 (1961))).\n97\n     See Sharp v. Johnson, 669 F.3d 144, 154-55 (3d Cir. 2012).\n98\n     See 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-2(a).\n99\n     Sharp, 669 F.3d at 154.\n100\n      Id. at 154-55.\n\n\n\n\n                               32\n\fCongress’s powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause\nand thus does not implicate the same concerns.101\n\n       For these reasons, we conclude that federal officers\nwho violate RFRA may be sued in their individual capacity\nfor damages.\n\n           ii.    Mack Has Alleged a Substantial\nBurden on His Religious\n     Exercise\n\n       We now address the merits of Mack’s RFRA claim.\nTo establish a prima facie case under RFRA, Mack must\nallege that the government (1) substantially burdened (2) a\nsincere (3) religious exercise.102 The Government does not\ndispute the sincerity of Mack’s exercise of his religious\nbeliefs. Thus, the only issue is whether Mack has sufficiently\nalleged a substantial burden on his religious exercise.\n\n       Although RFRA does not explicitly define the term\n“substantial burden,” we have explained that a substantial\nburden exists where (1) “a follower is forced to choose\n\n101\n    We are also unmoved by the conclusion of one district\ncourt that RFRA does not provide for damages against\nindividual officers because that form of relief was unavailable\nunder the Supreme Court jurisprudence that RFRA sought to\nrestore. See Tanvir v. Lynch, 128 F. Supp. 3d 756, 777-78\n(S.D.N.Y. 2015). As noted by the Supreme Court in Hobby\nLobby, RFRA provides “even broader protection for religious\nliberty than was available” previously. 134 S. Ct. at 2761 n.3.\n102\n   See Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do\nVegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 428 (2006).\n\n\n\n\n                              33\n\fbetween following the precepts of his religion and forfeiting\nbenefits otherwise generally available to other inmates versus\nabandoning one of the precepts of his religion in order to\nreceive a benefit;” or (2) “the government puts substantial\npressure on an adherent to substantially modify his behavior\nand to violate his beliefs.”103\n\n       Mack argues that the combination of Officer Roberts’\nanti-Muslim harassment and Officer Venslosky’s tacit\napproval created a hostile work environment that caused him\nto stop praying at work. We can reasonably infer from these\nallegations that Mack previously was in the practice of\npraying at work before the harassment took place. Although\nMack concedes that the officers did not directly command\nhim to cease praying, a burden can be “substantial” even if it\ninvolves indirect coercion to betray one’s religious beliefs.104\nBecause we think the indirect pressure the officers placed on\nMack may very well have substantially burdened his religious\nexercise, we conclude that his allegations are sufficient to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss. We will therefore vacate the\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of Mack’s RFRA claim and remand\nto the District Court for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n103\n   Washington v. Klem, 497 F.3d 272, 280 (3d Cir. 2007).\nAlthough Klem examined the definition of “substantial\nburden” in the context of RLUIPA, the two statutes are\nanalogous for purposes of the substantial burden test.\n104\n    See Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485\nU.S. 439, 450 (1988) (“[I]ndirect coercion or penalties on the\nfree exercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions, are\nsubject to scrutiny under the First Amendment.”).\n\n\n\n\n                              34\n\f            C.      Free Exercise Claim\n\n        Next, we address Mack’s claim that the prison\nofficers’ anti-Muslim conduct violated his First Amendment\nright to freely exercise his religion.105 Mack seeks only\nmonetary relief, asserting that he has an implied right of\naction for damages pursuant to Bivens. But neither the\nSupreme Court nor this Court has ever extended Bivens to\nFree Exercise claims. In view of RFRA’s broad protections\nfor religious liberty, we decline to do so here.\n\n       The Supreme Court in Wilkie v. Robbins106 set forth a\ntwo-part framework for considering whether to extend Bivens\nto new contexts. First, we ask whether there is an alternative\nremedial scheme available to the plaintiff and, if so, whether\nthe existing scheme “convinc[es]” us to refrain from\nproviding a new, freestanding damages remedy.107 If not,\nthen we consider whether “special factors” counsel hesitation\nin creating a new cause of action for damages.108 “Special\nfactors” typically relate to the question of who should decide\nwhether and how a remedy should be provided.109 We must\nkeep in mind, however, that “‘Congress is in a far better\n\n\n\n105\n   The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment\nprovides that “Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the\nfree exercise [of religion.]” U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 1.\n106\n      551 U.S. 537 (2007).\n107\n      Id. at 550.\n108\n      Id.\n109\n      See Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 380 (1983).\n\n\n\n\n                                  35\n\fposition than a court to evaluate the impact of a new species\nof litigation’ against those who act on the public’s behalf.”110\n        Mack’s argument fails at step one because the\nreligious liberty protections provided by RFRA strongly\nmilitate against creating a Bivens action for Free Exercise\nclaims. As detailed in our preceding section, RFRA provides\nMack with a comprehensive remedial scheme for violations\nof substantial burdens on his religious exercise. Indeed,\n“Congress enacted RFRA in order to provide greater\nprotection for religious exercise than is available under the\nFirst Amendment.”111 Under RFRA, burdens on religious\nexercise need not be intentional, only substantial. And, as we\nhave explained, RFRA provides claimants with all\n“appropriate relief” for such violations. Given this alternative\nremedial scheme, we can conceive no adequate justification\nfor extending Bivens to Free Exercise claims. We will\ntherefore affirm the District Court’s dismissal of Mack’s Free\nExercise claim.\n\n         D.     Equal Protection Claim\n\n       Finally, we address Mack’s equal protection claim\nunder the Fifth Amendment.112 To state an equal protection\n\n110\n      Wilkie, 551 U.S. at 562 (quoting Bush, 462 U.S. at 389).\n111\n      Holt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 859-60 (2015).\n112\n   Although the Fifth Amendment does not contain an equal\nprotection clause, the Supreme Court has construed the Fifth\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause as containing an equal\nprotection guarantee. See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete\nCo., 500 U.S. 614, 616 (1991).         Accordingly, “Fifth\nAmendment equal protection claims are examined under the\nsame principles that apply to such claims under the\n\n\n\n\n                                36\n\fclaim, Mack must allege that he was treated differently than\nother similarly situated inmates, and that this different\ntreatment was the result of intentional discrimination based\non his membership in a protected class, such as religious\naffiliation.113\n\n       Mack did not specifically raise an equal protection\nclaim in his amended complaint, though he argued in his first\ncomplaint that he was denied equal protection of prison\nregulations and/or policies.114 He elaborated in his opposition\nto the defendants’ motion to dismiss that he was “targeted”\nand “singled out . . . due to his faith, and that no other inmate\nwho[] worked in the commissary was treated with hostility\nbecause of their religion.”115 On appeal, Mack contends that\nthese allegations, construed liberally, support two plausible\ninferences: (1) that the defendants terminated him from his\nwork assignment because of his religion, and (2) that the\ndefendants harassed him because of his religion.\n\n       Even construing his pleadings liberally, we are not\nconvinced that Mack has sufficiently stated a claim for\ndiscriminatory termination based on his religion.          His\nallegations certainly make out the claim that he was fired\nbecause he complained of the anti-Muslim harassment against\nhim: “Plaintiff then stated . . . ‘[t]he only reason I’m being\n\nFourteenth Amendment.” Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, 239\nF.3d 307, 317 (3d Cir. 2001).\n113\n   See Hassan v. City of New York, 804 F.3d 277, 294, 298\n(3d Cir. 2015).\n114\n      Compl. 1.\n115\n      Mack, No. 3:10-cv-264, ECF No. 42, at 5.\n\n\n\n\n                               37\n\ffired is because I spoke to [Defendant] Mr. Stevens [sic]\nabout what Mr. Roberts did and said to me.’”116 But we find\nit much harder to construe his pleadings as making out the\nclaim that he was fired because he is Muslim, or that the\nofficers’ anti-Muslim animus played a role in their decision to\nfire him.\n\n       Mack’s discriminatory harassment claim fares no\nbetter. Mack alleges two instances of discriminatory conduct\nby Officer Roberts – first placing the Islam-offensive sticker\non his back, and then shouting that “there is no good Muslim\nexcept a dead Muslim.” While these instances certainly\nprovide strong evidence of Roberts’ anti-Muslim animus,\nthey do not, standing alone, state an equal protection\nviolation.117 We will therefore affirm the District Court’s\ndismissal of Mack’s equal protection claim.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       At first blush, this case may seem to lack merit. But\nMack’s allegations, taken as true, raise legitimate concerns\nabout how he was treated in prison. This case has also raised\n\n116\n   Am. Compl. ¶ 23. See id. ¶ 35 (alleging that Roberts and\nVenslosky “retaliate[d] against [Mack] by firing him from the\ncommissary job, because of plaintiff exercising his right to\nseek redress by way of (oral) grievance”).\n117\n   In other words, the behavior that Mack sets forth in his\ncomplaint – i.e., two instances of anti-Muslim harassment –\ndoes not force us to confront whether and to what extent\npersistent harassment may make out a claim for an equal\nprotection violation. We are confident that two instances of\nharassment are insufficient.\n\n\n\n\n                              38\n\fseveral unsettled issues about how or if a litigant such as\nMack may obtain relief. For reasons we have explored, we\nconclude that Mack’s First Amendment retaliation and RFRA\nclaims may proceed, and his First Amendment Free Exercise\nand Fifth Amendment equal protection claims may not. We\nwill therefore affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand to the\nDistrict Court for further proceedings consistent with this\nOpinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              39\n\f                      Mack v. Yost, et al.,\n\n                         No. 14-2738\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nROTH, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n        I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority\nin Part II A of its opinion that Mack has stated a First\nAmendment retaliation claim against defendants Roberts and\nVenslosky. I believe that, with regard to a retaliation claim\nmade by the inmate of a prison, oral complaints should not be\nconsidered protected conduct under the First Amendment.\nOral complaints, unlike written grievances, do not create a\nrecord. In fact, oral complaints may generate uncertainty\nabout the content, or even the existence, of the grievance. In\naddition, a written complaint better provides notice to prison\nofficials about the nature of the grievance and the individuals\nimplicated in it.1 This written notice is important because, in\nthe prison setting, inmates constantly interact with multiple\nprison officials, and “virtually any adverse action taken\nagainst a prisoner by a prison official—even those otherwise\nnot rising to the level of a constitutional violation—can be\ncharacterized as a constitutionally proscribed retaliatory act.”2\n\n\n1\n  Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503, 526-27 (5th Cir. 2004)\n(letters and forms filed by inmate provided prison officials\nnotice of the substantial risk that inmate faced for his safety).\n2\n  Davis v. Goord, 320 F.3d 346, 352 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal\nquotations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                1\n\f       Drawing a line between oral, informal complaints and\nwritten, formal grievances reflects some of the difficulties in\nthe administration of prisons and in the handling inmate\ngrievances. Congress had these concerns in mind when it\nenacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which directs\ninmates to comply with the correctional institution’s policy\non grievance resolution.3 The institution’s policy here, found\nin the Loretto inmate handbook, directs that inmates file\nwritten grievances; the handbook makes no mention of oral\ncomplaints.\n\n       As we set out above, the logic behind encouraging\nwritten rather than oral complaints is obvious when viewed in\nthe context of effective administration of the prison grievance\nsystem. The majority’s conclusion that an oral, informal\ncomplaint constitutes protected conduct under the First\nAmendment renders the administration of grievance\nprocedures more difficult and risks vastly increasing the\nnumber of prisoner lawsuits involving retaliation claims.\n\n        Furthermore, our precedent is clear that written\ngrievances do constitute protected conduct under the First\nAmendment. In Milhouse, we held that the inmate stated a\nclaim that he was subjected to a conspiratorially planned\nseries of disciplinary actions as retaliation for initiating a civil\nrights suit against prison officials.4 In Bistrian, we concluded\nthat the inmate stated a claim that prison officials confined\nhim in the segregated housing unit in retaliation for written\ncomplaints he filed through his attorney.5              A written\n\n3\n  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (2000).\n4\n  Milhouse v. Carlson, 652 F.2d 371, 373-74 (3d Cir. 1981).\n5\n  Bistrian v. Levi, 696 F.3d 352, 362-63 (3d Cir. 2012).\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fgrievance protects the prisoner as well as the prison\nadministration.\n\n       In conclusion, considering the policy behind the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act’s requirement that a grievance be in\nwriting and that it comply with the correctional institution’s\npolicy, along with the Loretto inmate handbook’s requirement\nthat grievances be in writing, I find that these requirements\nare “legitimate penological objectives of the corrections\nsystem.”6\n\n       I consider, therefore, that it is not a violation of a\nprisoner’s First Amendment rights to require that any\ngrievance that would form the basis for a retaliation claim be\nin writing and to refuse to find a retaliation claim arising from\nan oral complaint. Thus, I would affirm the District Court’s\ndismissal of the First Amendment retaliation claim.\n\n        I do, however, join the majority in its holding in Part\nII B that the allegations of the RFRA violation survive a\nmotion to dismiss and that that claim should be remanded to\nthe District Court. I also join the majority in its holding in\nPart II C and D that the District Court’s dismissal of the First\nAmendment Free Exercise claim and the RLUIPA claim be\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n6\n Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974) (holding that in\nthe First Amendment context “a prison inmate retains those\nFirst Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his\nstatus as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological\nobjectives of the corrections system.”).\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\f",

He also claims\nthat the same officers’ harassment had caused him to refrain\nfrom praying while at work. Mack brought this lawsuit pro\nse against various prison employees seeking monetary relief\nfor alleged violations of his rights under the First\nAmendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Religious Freedom\nand Restoration Act (“RFRA”). The District Court dismissed\nall of Mack’s claims.\n\n      Mack’s allegations raise several issues of first\nimpression in our Circuit, including (1) whether an inmate’s\n\n\n\n\n                             3\n\foral grievance to prison officials can constitute protected\nactivity under the Constitution; (2) whether RFRA prohibits\nindividual conduct that substantially burdens religious\nexercise; and (3) whether RFRA provides for monetary relief\nfrom an official sued in his individual capacity. We answer\nall three questions in the affirmative, and therefore conclude\nthat Mack has sufficiently pled a First Amendment retaliation\nclaim and a RFRA claim. We agree, however, that Mack’s\nFirst Amendment Free Exercise claim and Fifth Amendment\nequal protection claim must be dismissed. We will therefore\naffirm in part, vacate in part, and remand to the District Court\nfor further proceedings.\nI.      BACKGROUND\n\n     A.    Mack’s Allegations of Anti-Muslim\nHarassment\n\n        Mack’s pro se complaint includes the following\nallegations, which we assume are true for purposes of this\nappeal.2 Mack is an inmate at the Federal Correctional\nInstitution in Loretto, Pennsylvania (“FCI Loretto”). He\nworked for pay in the prison’s commissary from\napproximately May 2009 until he was terminated in October\n\n2\n  Finkelman v.

Because Mack proceeded pro se up until this\nappeal, we will also consider his allegations made in response\nto the defendants’ motion to dismiss, which incorporate and\nare consistent with the allegations in his complaint. See\nHughes v. Rowe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110352\"><a href=\"/opinion/110352/hughes-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9-10 & n.8 (1980) (per curiam)\n(considering pro se plaintiff’s amended complaint and\nresponse to the defendants’ motion to dismiss to conclude that\nplaintiff sufficiently stated a claim).\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f2009. His job responsibilities included stocking shelves,\nfilling inmate commissary orders, and cleaning the work area.\nAs a practicing Muslim, Mack was provided certain religious\naccommodations at work. For example, Mack did not have to\nhandle pork products at the commissary, he was provided a\nsuitable area in which he could pray during breaks, and he\nwas permitted to attend religious services on Friday.3\nDefendants Doug Roberts and Samuel Venslosky are\ncorrectional officers at FCI Loretto who were assigned to\nsupervise the commissary at the time Mack worked there.\nThey were responsible for the safety and security of the\ninmates and the orderly operation of the commissary.\n\n        While Mack was at work one day, Officer Roberts\nwalked up behind him and slapped him hard on the back.\nMack asked Roberts why he had hit him, to which Roberts\nresponded, “do you have a problem with what I did?”4 Mack\nsaid “yes,” and Roberts declared, “you’ll be looking for\nanother job soon!”5 Officer Venslosky and other inmates\nwitnessed this interaction and laughed. The officers and\ninmates continued to laugh and snicker at Mack throughout\nhis shift. When Mack finished work and left the commissary,\na fellow inmate informed him that he had an “I LOVE\nBACON” sticker affixed to the back of his shirt. Roberts\n\n3\n  See, e.g., Williams v.

Mack’s Complaints to Prison Staff\n\n       Seeking redress, Mack spoke with Jeff Stephens, who\nwas Roberts’ and Venslosky’s supervisor.10 Mack orally\ncomplained to Stephens about Roberts’ anti-Muslim conduct\nand statements, and about Venslosky’s inaction during both\nincidents. Stephens agreed to “look into it.”11 Approximately\none week later, Venslosky told Mack that he was being fired\nfrom his commissary position for “bringing in other inmates’\ncommissary slips.”12 Mack replied that this was untrue, and\nthat the only reason he was being fired was because he had\ncomplained to Stephens. Venslosky did not respond.\n\n       Convinced that Venslosky’s reason for firing him was\na sham, Mack located Stephens during his lunch period and\norally complained to him about his termination. Stephens\nagain responded that he would look into it. When nothing\ncame of that, Mack filed an inmate request-to-staff form\nseeking an explanation in writing for his termination.\nStephens provided Mack with a written response from\nVenslosky asserting that Mack was “caught bringing slips in\nfor inmates.”13 Mack then orally complained to the Warden,\nJohn Yost, during his next lunch period.

Procedural History\n\n        Mack filed suit pro se against Roberts, Venslosky,\nStephens, Warden Yost, and Deputy Warden Kuhn for\nalleged constitutional violations pursuant to Bivens v. Six\nUnknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of\nNarcotics,15 and for violations of the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (“RLUIPA”).16 Among\nother things, Mack alleged that the defendants violated his\nrights under the Petition Clause of the First Amendment,\nwhich protects “the right of the people . . . to petition the\nGovernment for a redress of grievances.”17 In particular,\nMack claimed that he was retaliated against for seeking to\nredress his grievances, that is, for orally complaining to\nStephens about Roberts’ and Venslosky’s anti-Muslim\nconduct.\n\n       The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure\nto state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n14\n     Id. ¶ 28.\n15\n   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971) (recognizing an implied private right\nof action for damages against federal officials alleged to have\nviolated a person’s constitutional rights).\n16\n     42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc et seq.\n17\n     U.S. Const. amend.

Mack appealed, and this Court vacated and\nremanded.18 We directed the District Court to consider in the\nfirst instance whether an inmate’s oral complaint to prison\nstaff constitutes protected activity under the First\nAmendment’s right to petition.19 We noted that “[f]iling a\nformal prison grievance clearly constitutes protected\nactivity,” but acknowledged that “certain informal, oral\ncomplaints to prison personnel have been held to constitute\nprotected activity as well.”20 We also explained that Mack’s\nallegations “clearly invite inquiry into” whether the\ndefendants violated Mack’s “First Amendment right to\npractice as a Muslim,” and that Mack’s claims should not\nhave been dismissed without leave to amend.21\n\n        At the direction of the District Court, Mack filed an\namended complaint, which largely tracks his original\ncomplaint. Construed liberally, Mack’s amended complaint\nraises three constitutional claims and one statutory claim: (1)\nFirst Amendment retaliation, invoking the Petition Clause; (2)\nFirst Amendment Free Exercise Clause violation; (3) Fifth\nAmendment equal protection violation; and (4) Religious\nFreedom and Restoration Act violation.22 From Roberts and\n\n18\n     Mack v.

Addressing Mack’s First Amendment retaliation\nclaim, the District Court held that “[a]n oral complaint to a\nprison guard is not a petitioning for the redress of grievances\nguaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.”24 The\nCourt accordingly dismissed this claim, reasoning that Mack\n“had not filed a petition with an administrative agency,\nwhether by formal or informal means,” until after the alleged\nretaliation occurred.25 The District Court also rejected\nMack’s equal protection claim because Mack had not\nidentified any similarly situated individuals whom prison\nofficials treated differently.26 As for Mack’s Free Exercise\nand RFRA claims, which the District Court construed as\n“potential” claims, the District Court held that the defendants\nneither intentionally nor substantially burdened Mack’s\n\n‘nearly identical’ to those under the RLUIPA, the Court will\naddress whether Mack can assert an actionable RFRA claim.”\n(internal citations omitted)).\n23\n  Mack sued Stephens, Yost, and Kuhn for damages in both\ntheir individual and official capacities.

DISCUSSION29\n\n        There are many layers to this case. First, we will\ndiscuss Mack’s First Amendment retaliation claim and the\nGovernment’s corresponding defenses. With respect to this\nclaim, we conclude that Mack has alleged sufficient facts to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss and that the defendants are not\nentitled to qualified immunity at this juncture. We will\ndismiss this claim, however, as to Defendants Yost and Kuhn.\n\n       Second, we will discuss Mack’s RFRA claim. We\nconclude that (i) Mack can properly bring this claim against\nprison officers for their individual conduct, (ii) he can seek\nmonetary damages from the officers, and (iii) his allegations\nsufficiently allege a substantial burden on his religious\nexercise.\n\n\n\n\n29\n  The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de\nnovo a district court’s decision dismissing a complaint.\nFinkelman, 810 F.3d at 192. We note that “the standards of\nreview for an underlying dismissal order and for the denial of\na motion for reconsideration of the dismissal order are\nfunctionally equivalent, because we exercise plenary review\nof the dismissal order as well as of the legal questions in the\ndenial of reconsideration.” Wiest v.

We conclude that there is no available\nremedy for Mack under this claim and we will accordingly\ndismiss it.\n\n       Finally, we will discuss Mack’s equal protection claim.\nWe conclude that this claim is insufficient to survive a motion\nto dismiss.\n\n       A.     First Amendment Retaliation Claim\n\n           i.     Mack’s First Amendment Retaliation\nClaim Against Warden Yost and Deputy Warden Kuhn\nMust Be Dismissed\n\n        Mack claims that he was retaliated against for orally\ncomplaining to Stephens about Roberts’ and Venslosky’s\nconduct. While Mack brings this claim against Warden Yost\nand Deputy Warden Kuhn as well, his complaint makes it\nclear that he only spoke to these defendants after the alleged\nretaliation occurred. There is nothing alleged from which we\ncan infer that Yost and Kuhn were personally involved in any\npurported retaliation. Because plaintiffs in a Bivens suit\n“must plead that each Government-official defendant, through\nthe official’s own individual actions, has violated the\nConstitution,”30 Mack’s First Amendment retaliation claim\nagainst Yost and Kuhn must be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n30\n  Bistrian v.

Mack Properly Exhausted His\nAdministrative Remedies as to His First Amendment\nRetaliation Claim\n\n        The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) requires\nprisoners to exhaust any and all prison grievance remedies\nbefore filing suit in federal court.31 “Failure to exhaust is an\naffirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.”32\nThe Government contends that Mack’s First Amendment\nretaliation claim must be dismissed because Mack did not\nexhaust his administrative remedies. It concedes that Mack\ndescribed in his formal grievance much of the alleged\nwrongdoing in this case. Nevertheless, it argues that because\nMack’s grievance never mentioned his oral complaint to\nStephens about Roberts’ and Venslosky’s anti-Muslim\nconduct—the alleged protected speech that forms the basis of\nhis retaliation claim—this claim was not properly exhausted.\nWe find this argument unconvincing.\n\n       Under the PLRA, a grievance must be described in a\nlevel of detail sufficient to satisfy the prison’s standards.33\nThe Government describes the Bureau of Prison’s (“BOP”)\nprocedures as “silent or vague” regarding the level of detail\nrequired in a grievance.34 When this is the case, an inmate’s\n\n31\n     42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n32\n     Small v.

In his formal grievance, Mack claimed that the\nresponse to his request was vague, and that he was “fired\nfrom [his] job for no reason.”37 He went on to explain the\nanti-Muslim harassment he endured at work. When his\ngrievance was rejected, Mack explained in his appeal that the\nprison’s proffered explanation for his termination was a\n“cover-up attempt.”38 He claimed that he was fired from his\njob for “NO real reason related to [his] work.”39\n\n       Mack clearly alerted prison officials to his principal\nallegation – i.e., that he was removed from his commissary\nposition for a pretextual reason. Even if Mack did not detail\nhis allegedly protected speech, his grievance nonetheless\nnotified officials that he believed he was unlawfully\nterminated from his work assignment as retaliation for\nexercising his First Amendment rights. Exhaustion merely\nrequires “inmates [to] provide enough information about the\nconduct of which they complain to allow prison officials to\n\n35\n     Strong v.

A Bivens Action Exists for Mack’s\nFirst Amendment Retaliation Claim\n\n       The Government next argues that Mack cannot bring a\nFirst Amendment retaliation claim under Bivens. In Bivens,\nthe Supreme Court “recognized for the first time an implied\nprivate action for damages against federal officers alleged to\nhave violated a citizen’s [Fourth Amendment] rights.”41\nThus, a Bivens action is a private cause of action for money\ndamages implied directly from the Constitution.           The\nSupreme Court has extended Bivens to two other contexts:\nsuits brought under the equal protection component of the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and suits\nbrought under the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of\nthe Eighth Amendment.42 Although the Supreme Court has\n\n\n40\n     Johnson v.

We\ndisagree.\n\n       The Petition Clause embraces a broad range of\ncommunications, and the availability of its protections has\nnever turned on a perceived distinction between written and\noral speech.55 Both the Free Speech Clause and the Petition\nClause protect “personal expression” – both expression\ngenerally and expression directed towards the government for\nthe specific purpose of asking it to right a wrong.56 In this\ncontext, form is secondary to content.\n\n53\n   Id. at 530 (internal quotation marks omitted and\npunctuation modified).\n54\n     Mack, 427 F.

His\ncomplaint concerned a prison guard’s conduct that the prison\nitself proscribes—religious harassment.60 His complaint was\nnot obscene or inappropriate. In fact, the Government\nconcedes that Mack’s oral grievance was “minimally\ndisruptive and arguably valuable.”61 And Mack complained\nalmost immediately after the harassment occurred,\nundermining any contention that Mack formulated some sort\nof plan to lodge a complaint in order to bring a frivolous\nlawsuit. In short, Mack’s oral grievance sufficiently and\ntimely put prison officials on notice that he was seeking\nredress, was conveyed to prison officials in a reasonable\nmanner, and concerned conduct that the prison itself\nprohibits. Under the circumstances of this case, these factors\nlead us to conclude that Mack’s oral grievance is entitled to\nconstitutional protection.\n\n       Significantly, moreover, prison officials at FCI Loretto\nmay have actually encouraged inmates to communicate their\nconcerns orally.

Indeed, “[r]etaliating against a prisoner for\nthe exercise of [any of] his constitutional rights is\nunconstitutional.”75     Retaliatory termination is clearly\nunlawful, both inside and outside the prison context.76 The\nfact that the officers retaliated against Mack before he\nreduced his grievance to writing is inconsequential. While\nwe have never held before today that a prisoner’s oral\ngrievance, in particular, is constitutionally protected, we have\ncertainly never suggested that such a grievance is entitled to\nlower protection than one reduced to writing. And there are\nmyriad cases outside the prison context that make no\ndistinction between oral and written grievances.77 Thus we\nhave little doubt concluding that prisoners’ oral grievances\nare indeed entitled to constitutional protection. A reasonable\nofficial in the prison officers’ position should therefore have\nknown that retaliating against Mack for exercising his right to\npetition, whether in the form of an oral or written grievance,\nwas unlawful.78 This is especially so if the prison actually\nencourages its inmates to communicate their concerns orally.\n\n75\n     Bistrian, 696 F.3d at 376.\n76\n   Although prisoners have no liberty or property interest in\nprison employment, James v.

RFRA’s Remedial Scope\n\n       Mack’s claim raises two threshold questions: (1)\nwhether RFRA is the appropriate vehicle for relief when the\nchallenged government action is an official’s individual\nconduct, as opposed to a law, regulation, or policy, or conduct\npursuant to such; and (2) whether RFRA allows a litigant to\n\nAmendment right is permitted when that exercise takes the\nform of speech but is not permitted when the same expression\nis written.”); Pearson, 471 F.3d at 742 (“[W]e think a\nreasonable public official in [the defendant’s] position would\nunderstand that retaliating against a prisoner on the basis of\nhis [oral] complaints about prison conditions is unlawful.”).\n79\n     42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                26\n\fsue a government official for money damages.

Nothing in the text of RFRA suggests that\nthe “official” or “person” must be acting in furtherance of an\nofficial policy. This interpretation is consistent with the\n\n\n80\n  Burwell v.

The Court applied the\nlongstanding presumption that, “absent clear direction to the\ncontrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to\naward any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action\nbrought pursuant to a federal statute.”93 “Finding no express\ncongressional intent to limit the remedies available under the\nimplied right of action, the Court held that compensatory\ndamages were available” under Title IX.94\n\n       The same presumption applies here – more so, we\nthink, because Congress expressly stated that a claimant may\nobtain “appropriate relief” against the government – the exact\nlanguage used in Franklin. Congress enacted RFRA one year\nafter Franklin was decided and was therefore well aware that\n“appropriate relief” means what it says, and that, without\nexpressly stating otherwise, all appropriate relief would be\navailable.95 Of course, the relief has to be appropriate vis-à-\nvis the purposes of the statute.

Mack Has Alleged a Substantial\nBurden on His Religious\n     Exercise\n\n       We now address the merits of Mack’s RFRA claim.\nTo establish a prima facie case under RFRA, Mack must\nallege that the government (1) substantially burdened (2) a\nsincere (3) religious exercise.102 The Government does not\ndispute the sincerity of Mack’s exercise of his religious\nbeliefs. Thus, the only issue is whether Mack has sufficiently\nalleged a substantial burden on his religious exercise.\n\n       Although RFRA does not explicitly define the term\n“substantial burden,” we have explained that a substantial\nburden exists where (1) “a follower is forced to choose\n\n101\n    We are also unmoved by the conclusion of one district\ncourt that RFRA does not provide for damages against\nindividual officers because that form of relief was unavailable\nunder the Supreme Court jurisprudence that RFRA sought to\nrestore.

We can reasonably infer from these\nallegations that Mack previously was in the practice of\npraying at work before the harassment took place. Although\nMack concedes that the officers did not directly command\nhim to cease praying, a burden can be “substantial” even if it\ninvolves indirect coercion to betray one’s religious beliefs.104\nBecause we think the indirect pressure the officers placed on\nMack may very well have substantially burdened his religious\nexercise, we conclude that his allegations are sufficient to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss. We will therefore vacate the\nDistrict Court’s dismissal of Mack’s RFRA claim and remand\nto the District Court for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n103\n   Washington v.

Free Exercise Claim\n\n        Next, we address Mack’s claim that the prison\nofficers’ anti-Muslim conduct violated his First Amendment\nright to freely exercise his religion.105 Mack seeks only\nmonetary relief, asserting that he has an implied right of\naction for damages pursuant to Bivens. But neither the\nSupreme Court nor this Court has ever extended Bivens to\nFree Exercise claims. In view of RFRA’s broad protections\nfor religious liberty, we decline to do so here.\n\n       The Supreme Court in Wilkie v. Robbins106 set forth a\ntwo-part framework for considering whether to extend Bivens\nto new contexts. First, we ask whether there is an alternative\nremedial scheme available to the plaintiff and, if so, whether\nthe existing scheme “convinc[es]” us to refrain from\nproviding a new, freestanding damages remedy.107 If not,\nthen we consider whether “special factors” counsel hesitation\nin creating a new cause of action for damages.108 “Special\nfactors” typically relate to the question of who should decide\nwhether and how a remedy should be provided.109 We must\nkeep in mind, however, that “‘Congress is in a far better\n\n\n\n105\n   The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment\nprovides that “Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the\nfree exercise [of religion.]” U.S. Const. amend.

As detailed in our preceding section, RFRA provides\nMack with a comprehensive remedial scheme for violations\nof substantial burdens on his religious exercise. Indeed,\n“Congress enacted RFRA in order to provide greater\nprotection for religious exercise than is available under the\nFirst Amendment.”111 Under RFRA, burdens on religious\nexercise need not be intentional, only substantial. And, as we\nhave explained, RFRA provides claimants with all\n“appropriate relief” for such violations. Given this alternative\nremedial scheme, we can conceive no adequate justification\nfor extending Bivens to Free Exercise claims. We will\ntherefore affirm the District Court’s dismissal of Mack’s Free\nExercise claim.\n\n         D.     Equal Protection Claim\n\n       Finally, we address Mack’s equal protection claim\nunder the Fifth Amendment.112 To state an equal protection\n\n110\n      Wilkie, 551 U.S. at 562 (quoting Bush, 462 U.S. at 389).\n111\n      Holt v.

Accordingly, “Fifth\nAmendment equal protection claims are examined under the\nsame principles that apply to such claims under the\n\n\n\n\n                                36\n\fclaim, Mack must allege that he was treated differently than\nother similarly situated inmates, and that this different\ntreatment was the result of intentional discrimination based\non his membership in a protected class, such as religious\naffiliation.113\n\n       Mack did not specifically raise an equal protection\nclaim in his amended complaint, though he argued in his first\ncomplaint that he was denied equal protection of prison\nregulations and/or policies.114 He elaborated in his opposition\nto the defendants’ motion to dismiss that he was “targeted”\nand “singled out . . . due to his faith, and that no other inmate\nwho[] worked in the commissary was treated with hostility\nbecause of their religion.”115 On appeal, Mack contends that\nthese allegations, construed liberally, support two plausible\ninferences: (1) that the defendants terminated him from his\nwork assignment because of his religion, and (2) that the\ndefendants harassed him because of his religion.\n\n       Even construing his pleadings liberally, we are not\nconvinced that Mack has sufficiently stated a claim for\ndiscriminatory termination based on his religion.

Mack alleges two instances of discriminatory conduct\nby Officer Roberts – first placing the Islam-offensive sticker\non his back, and then shouting that “there is no good Muslim\nexcept a dead Muslim.” While these instances certainly\nprovide strong evidence of Roberts’ anti-Muslim animus,\nthey do not, standing alone, state an equal protection\nviolation.117 We will therefore affirm the District Court’s\ndismissal of Mack’s equal protection claim.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       At first blush, this case may seem to lack merit. But\nMack’s allegations, taken as true, raise legitimate concerns\nabout how he was treated in prison. This case has also raised\n\n116\n   Am. Compl. ¶ 23. See id. ¶ 35 (alleging that Roberts and\nVenslosky “retaliate[d] against [Mack] by firing him from the\ncommissary job, because of plaintiff exercising his right to\nseek redress by way of (oral) grievance”).\n117\n   In other words, the behavior that Mack sets forth in his\ncomplaint – i.e., two instances of anti-Muslim harassment –\ndoes not force us to confront whether and to what extent\npersistent harassment may make out a claim for an equal\nprotection violation. We are confident that two instances of\nharassment are insufficient.\n\n\n\n\n                              38\n\fseveral unsettled issues about how or if a litigant such as\nMack may obtain relief. For reasons we have explored, we\nconclude that Mack’s First Amendment retaliation and RFRA\nclaims may proceed, and his First Amendment Free Exercise\nand Fifth Amendment equal protection claims may not. We\nwill therefore affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand to the\nDistrict Court for further proceedings consistent with this\nOpinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              39\n\f                      Mack v.

I believe that, with regard to a retaliation claim\nmade by the inmate of a prison, oral complaints should not be\nconsidered protected conduct under the First Amendment.\nOral complaints, unlike written grievances, do not create a\nrecord. In fact, oral complaints may generate uncertainty\nabout the content, or even the existence, of the grievance. In\naddition, a written complaint better provides notice to prison\nofficials about the nature of the grievance and the individuals\nimplicated in it.1 This written notice is important because, in\nthe prison setting, inmates constantly interact with multiple\nprison officials, and “virtually any adverse action taken\nagainst a prisoner by a prison official—even those otherwise\nnot rising to the level of a constitutional violation—can be\ncharacterized as a constitutionally proscribed retaliatory act.”2\n\n\n1\n  Johnson v.

Congress had these concerns in mind when it\nenacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which directs\ninmates to comply with the correctional institution’s policy\non grievance resolution.3 The institution’s policy here, found\nin the Loretto inmate handbook, directs that inmates file\nwritten grievances; the handbook makes no mention of oral\ncomplaints.\n\n       As we set out above, the logic behind encouraging\nwritten rather than oral complaints is obvious when viewed in\nthe context of effective administration of the prison grievance\nsystem. The majority’s conclusion that an oral, informal\ncomplaint constitutes protected conduct under the First\nAmendment renders the administration of grievance\nprocedures more difficult and risks vastly increasing the\nnumber of prisoner lawsuits involving retaliation claims.\n\n        Furthermore, our precedent is clear that written\ngrievances do constitute protected conduct under the First\nAmendment. In Milhouse, we held that the inmate stated a\nclaim that he was subjected to a conspiratorially planned\nseries of disciplinary actions as retaliation for initiating a civil\nrights suit against prison officials.4 In Bistrian, we concluded\nthat the inmate stated a claim that prison officials confined\nhim in the segregated housing unit in retaliation for written\ncomplaints he filed through his attorney.5              A written\n\n3\n  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (2000).\n4\n  Milhouse v.

Thus, I would affirm the District Court’s\ndismissal of the First Amendment retaliation claim.\n\n        I do, however, join the majority in its holding in Part\nII B that the allegations of the RFRA violation survive a\nmotion to dismiss and that that claim should be remanded to\nthe District Court. I also join the majority in its holding in\nPart II C and D that the District Court’s dismissal of the First\nAmendment Free Exercise claim and the RLUIPA claim be\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n6\n Pell v.
