(Return of Record [ROR], Transcript, p. 144.)<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> Nancy Costa applied to DSS for Title XIX medical assistance for long term care on June 26, 1998. (ROR, Hearing Summary, p. 21.) DSS denied the application on November 24, 1998 based upon a finding that Nancy Costa had excess assets. (ROR, Hearing Summary, p. 21.) On January 4, 1999, Nancy Costa requested an administrative hearing to contest the denial of her application and to request an increase in the community spouse protected amount (CSPA). (ROR, p. 75.) On March 2, 1999, a DSS fair hearing officer (FHO) conducted an evidentiary hearing. (ROR, Transcript, pp. 139-59.) The FHO issued a written decision dated May 19, 1999, that included findings of fact and conclusions of law. (ROR, May 19, 1999 Hearing Decision, pp. 1-5.) The FHO disagreed with the denial of Title XIX benefits and directed the regional office to increase the CSPA, provided all other eligibility factors were met. (ROR, May 19, 1999 Hearing Decision, pp. 1-5.) On May 25, 1999, the FHO learned that the community spouse,<sup id=\"ref-fn2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> Adolfo Costa, had died even before the administrative hearing was requested by the institutionalized spouse.<sup id=\"ref-fn3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117.) The ERG reopened the record and requested additional information from the parties. (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117.) On March 21, 2000, the FHO rendered a reconsidered decision denying Title XIX benefits.<sup id=\"ref-fn4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup> (ROR, March 21, 2000 Reconsidered Decision, pp. 6-11.) Briefly stated, the FHO reasoned that the financial needs of the community spouse concluded at the time of his death. Accordingly, he did not need an increase in his CSPA to avoid impoverishment.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff commenced the present administrative appeal through her petition for appeal filed in the Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain.</p>\n<p><center>                            III. <u>Jurisdiction</u></center>\nA. <u>Aggrievement</u></p>\n<p>General Statutes &#167; <cross_reference>17b-61</cross_reference> (b) provides in pertinent part: \"[T]he applicant . . . if aggrieved, may appeal therefrom in accordance with &#167; <cross_reference>4-183</cross_reference>.\" General Statutes &#167; <cross_reference>4-183</cross_reference> (a) provides in relevant part that \"[a] person . . . who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court. . . .\"</p>\n<blockquote><p>  [T]he fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal CT Page 10574 interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole.

(ROR, Hearing Decision, pp. 2-3.)</p>\n<p>On May 25, 1999, six days after the decision was rendered, the FHO learned that Adolfo Costa, the community spouse, had died on or about December 27, 1998. (ROR, March 21, 2000 Hearing Decision, p. 7.) As a result, the FHO reopened the record pursuant to General Statutes &#167;<cross_reference>4-181a</cross_reference> (a)<sup id=\"ref-fn5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> and sent the parties a letter dated June 2, 1999, requesting that both parties respond to the following questions: \"(1) Does Mrs. Costa have standing to request a hearing to contest the Department's spousal assessment? and (2) For what purpose does Mrs. Costa seek to increase the Community Spouse Protected Allowance above the amount set by the Department on November 24, 1998?\" (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117.) Both parties responded but neither party submitted additional evidence or requested further proceedings.</p>\n<p>The FHO reopened the record pursuant to General Statutes &#167; <cross_reference>4-181a</cross_reference>, conducted a desk review of the issues and closed the record on September 1, 1999. (ROR, March 21, 2000 Reconsidered Decision, pp. 6-11.) On March 21, 2000, the FHO rendered a reconsidered decision which was subsequently amended on April 19, 2000. The decision provided in relevant part:</p>\n<p><center>                               <u>DISCUSSION</u></center><blockquote>  It was not shown in this hearing that during the lifetime of the applicant's spouse, in order to avoid impoverishment, he needed to retain more than the amount of his spousal share of the couple's total assets, as determined by the Department on November 24, 1998. The community spouse's needs ceased at his death. He therefore did not need to have his CSPA increased for the purpose of meeting his MMNA. That is the only purpose for which a hearing officer can increase a CSPA which has been correctly determined by the regional office staff. The applicant's CSPA cannot be increased.</p>\n<p>  The applicant's spouse did have an MMNA from the date of his wife's application for Medicaid until the date of his death. During this period his spousal share of the couple's assets, $81,690.00, combined with his income, was sufficient to meet his MMNA. Since it was not necessary to increase this CSPA in order to prevent impoverishment of this community spouse I have found that this CSPA may not be increased.

The plaintiff further contends \"the purpose of the `Spousal Impoverishment' rules is to prevent the impoverishment of the community spouse, the ruling of the DSS in this case is counter to the spirit and intent of the federal scheme.\" (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 7.)</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also argues that she was deprived of her due process protections by the FHO's reversal of the March 2, 1999 decision granting her Medicaid benefits because she had a protected property interest in CT Page 10583 those benefits. In this regard she contends that she was entitled to: (1) notice and a hearing prior to the Department's revocation of her benefits; (2) timely and adequate notice of a proposed benefit termination pursuant to UPM &#167; 1500.01;<sup id=\"ref-fn7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup> and (3) an opportunity to present or address evidence or arguments. (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 16.) In addition, the plaintiff contends that her first opportunity to be heard was untimely as it occurred eight months after she applied for benefits and that she did not receive adequate notice pursuant to UPM &#167; 1500.01. (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 20.)</p>\n<p>DSS contends that, \"[t]he crux of the community spouse provisions are to prevent impoverishment of the community spouse. Consideration of the community spouse's \"needs' only makes sense if the spouse is alive. At a most fundamental level, therefore, the statutes and regulations presume that there is a living community spouse.\" (Defendant's Brief, 13.) DSS asserts that the hearing process was impeded because the plaintiff neglected to provide the department with accurate facts, i.e., that her spouse had died two months prior to the hearing. (Defendant's Brief, p. 11.) DSS further argues that the plaintiff had no property interest in receiving benefits because her application had not been approved. (Defendant's Brief, p. 13.) DSS further contends that the FHO's conclusions were supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record and were well within the FHO's discretion. (Defendant's Brief, p. 16, et seq.) Finally, with regard to the adequacy of notice, DSS argues that the FHO's June 2, 1999 notice of reconsideration stated that pursuant to General Statutes &#167; <cross_reference>4-181a</cross_reference> (a) the record was being reopened and that the FHO's intent was quite clear based on the questions she posed to the parties.

DSS denied the plaintiff's application for long term nursing home medical assistance because, on the date of her institutionalization, her assets, $65,567.98, exceeded the agency's asset limit of $1600. (ROR, Hearing Summary, p. 21; ROR, Assessment of Spousal Assets, p. 32.)</p>\n<p>The purpose of the March 2, 1999, fair hearing, convened by the FHO, was to permit the plaintiff to have the opportunity to attempt to establish a need to increase the CSPA in order to generate enough income to meet Adolfo Costa's MMNA. (ROR, Transcript, p. 148.) The plaintiff's attorney presented evidence at the hearing in support of the position that the CSPA should be increased because Adolfo Costa had insufficient income to meet his MMNA. (ROR, Transcript, pp. 150 et seq.) At the time of the March 2, 1999 hearing, the FHO was unaware that Adolfo Costa was dead. In fact, the record reflects that he died on December 27, 1998, approximately two months earlier. (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117) Neither the plaintiff's attorney nor her daughter, who had been granted her mother's power of attorney, informed the FHO that the community spouse had since died. In fact, references were made throughout the hearing from which it was reasonable to conclude CT Page 10586 that Adolfo Costa was still alive, e.g., the initial application for benefits was presented as a full exhibit (ROR, Transcript, p. 152), and the plaintiff's attorney informed the FHO that he was the attorney for both Adolfo and Nancy Costa (ROR, Transcript, p. 143.) It was not until January 4, 1999, or approximately nine days after the community spouse's untimely death that the surviving spouse even requested a fair hearing to contest the denial of Nancy Costa's Title XIX application for Medicaid assistance and to increase the CSPA. (ROR, January 4, 1999 request for fair hearing, p. 75.)</p>\n<p>Approximately six days after issuing her May 19, 1999 decision, the FHO discovered that Adolfo Costa had in fact died almost five months earlier on December 27, 1998.<sup id=\"ref-fn9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup> (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117.) Having learned this new information, the FHO reopened the record and requested additional information from the parties. (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117.)</p>\n<p>The plaintiff claims she was deprived of her due process protections by the FHO's reversal of the May 19, 1999 decision because she had a protected property interest in receiving Title XIX benefits. The constitution of Connecticut, article <cross_reference>first</cross_reference>, &#167; <cross_reference>10</cross_reference> and the due process clause of the United States Constitution prohibits state actors from depriving individuals of property or liberty without due process. In<u>Harkless v. Rowe,</u> <cross_reference>232 Conn. 599</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>616</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>657 A.2d 562</cross_reference> (1995), the Connecticut Supreme Court outlined the elements a plaintiff must meet in order to prevail on a due process claim: \"(1) [they have] been deprived of . . . property [or liberty] interest[s] cognizable under the due process clause; and (2) the deprivation of the property [or liberty] interest[s] has occurred without due process of law.\"</p>\n<p>The plaintiff relies on <u>Shea v. State Employees' Retirement</u><u>Commission,</u> <cross_reference>170 Conn. 610</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>368 A.2d 159</cross_reference> (1976), for the proposition that property rights exist in benefits that have been approved but not yet received. The plaintiff's reliance under the facts in this case is in error because in this instance she had no vested interest in Medicaid benefits. Nancy Costa was to be awarded Title XIX benefits \"provided all other eligibility factors ha[d] been met.\" (ROR, May 19, 1999 Hearing Decision, p. 4.) The FHO's initial decision to award benefits was contingent on all other eligibility factors being met. It is reasonable for a FHO to consider a community spouse being alive as an eligibility factor when determining whether a CSPA should be increased in order to avoid the community spouse's impoverishment. Hence, where the FHO later discovered this eligibility requirement was not fulfilled the benefits were not awarded. As the plaintiff's application for Medicaid benefits had never been approved, there could be no termination that violated her due process rights. Therefore, the FHO's decision to deny the plaintiff's CT Page 10587 application did not violate her due process.</p>\n<p>The court has determined that the plaintiff failed to obtain a property interest in the Title XIX benefits. In addition, the court has determined that the due process accorded was sufficient in this instance. \"Inquiry into whether particular procedures are constitutionally mandated in a given instance requires adherence to the principle that due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. There is no per se rule that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever a liberty interest may be affected. Due process . . . is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances. . . .\" (Citations omitted.) <u>State v.

Therefore, the court deems it unnecessary to discuss the issue further other than to note that both parties had adequate notice that Adolfo Costa's death was at issue by virtue of the FHO's correspondence dated June 2, 1999 and that each party was given ample opportunity to respond and address the FHO and neither choose to present additional evidence, argument or request an administrative hearing. (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117; ROR, DSS responses, pp. 43-44, Plaintiff's response, p. 112.)</p>\n<p>In the present case, the community spouse died before the institutionalized spouse requested a fair hearing to contest her eligibility of benefits. A hearing was then held to determine if the community spouse's income should be increased in order to meet his MMNA, at which time no one informed the FHO that Adolfo Costa was dead. The FHO's ensuing decision was based on the premise that Adolfo Costa was still alive and she granted Adolfo Costa an increase in his CSPA, due to the insufficiency in his monthly income \"provided all other eligibility factors have been met.\" (ROR, May 19, 1999 Hearing Decision, p. 4.). Once the complete set of facts was established it was reasonable for the FHO to conclude that the community spouse had no unmet needs.</p>\n<p>Given the policy behind the MCCA, the court finds that the FHO was correct in rendering her corrected reconsidered decision. As previously indicated, \"[t]he legislative history of the MCCA establishes that Congress sought to end the pauperization of community spouses by assuring that the community spouse has a sufficient &#8212; but not excessive &#8212; amount of income and resources available to her while her spouse is in a nursing home. H.R. Rep. No. 100-105 (II), 100th Cong., 2d Sess. at 65 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 857, 888.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <u>O'Callaghan v. Commissioner of Social</u><u>Services,</u> supra, <cross_reference>53 Conn. App. 211</cross_reference>. Here, the plaintiff did not establish CT Page 10588 that the community spouse had insufficient resources during his lifetime. Only when a community spouse requires income generated by the institutionalized spouse's share of the couple's assets to meet his MMNA is the FHO authorized to increase the CSPA.<sup id=\"ref-fn10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup> In this case, the FHO concluded the community spouse had sufficient income and resources to meet his needs in the community from the date of the plaintiff's institutionalization to the time of his death and had no need for an increased CSPA. (ROR, April 19, 2000 Corrected Reconsidered Decision, pp. 12-16.)</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also argues that her first opportunity to be heard, eight months after her application for benefits, was untimely. However, the record discloses that the plaintiff waited approximately six months from the time she applied for benefits to request a hearing. DSS could not conduct the hearing until it was requested by the plaintiff, and once she requested the hearing it was held within two months.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also claims that, pursuant to General Statutes &#167;<cross_reference>17b-61</cross_reference>,<sup id=\"ref-fn11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11</a></sup> the FHO officer was mandated to issue an opinion within 60 days and her failure to do so invalidates the decision. The defendant argues that the term \"shall\" is directory and not mandatory. It has been held that \"the time period for the hearing officer to render a decision is not mandatory but directory\" and that an \"untimely decision is not void.\" <u>Reynolds v. Dept. of Social Services,</u> Superior Court, judicial district of Litchfield, Docket No. 79927 (June 9, 2000, <em>DiPentima, J</em>.) (<cross_reference>27 Conn.L.Rptr. 303</cross_reference>). In support of this proposition, the court quoted<u>Angelsea Productions, Inc. v. Commission on Human Rights </u><u>Opportunities,</u> supra, <cross_reference>236 Conn. 681</cross_reference>, for the proposition that \"the use of the word `shall' though significant, does not invariably establish a mandatory duty.\" The court emphasized, \"[t]here are other considerations in determining the intent of the legislature as to whether the time period for rendering a decision under &#167; <cross_reference>17b-61</cross_reference> is mandatory so that noncompliance would invalidate the action.\" In addition, it has been held that, \"[Section] <cross_reference>17b-61</cross_reference> is silent as to the effect of a decision rendered beyond the sixty day period. No penalty is imposed. The statute does not provide that the failure to render a decision within the specified time entitles the person to an automatic granting of the relief sought. The statute appears to be designed to promote convenience, efficiency and dispatch in the rendering of decisions.\" <u>Lucas v. Dept. of Social</u><u>Services,</u> Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. 488956 (July 21, 2000, <em>Hartmere, J</em>.).</p>\n<p>The FHO did not compromise the purpose of the statute by failing to render a decision within sixty days of closing the record. This court agrees that the time period for rendering a decision is merely directory. Here, particularly, the FHO was justified in taking an CT Page 10589 extended period of time to render her decision in light of the plaintiff's nondisclosure of the community spouse's actual status.</p>\n<p>The court finds that, based upon the law and the substantial evidence in the record, the FHO's conclusion that the community spouse had no unmet needs and did not warrant an increased CSPA was not unreasonable, arbitrary, illegal, or in abuse of its discretion. Furthermore, the court finds that the plaintiff was accorded the appropriate due process under the circumstances presented.</p>\n<p>3.  <u>DSS's Conduct Denied the Plaintiff Equal Protection Under the</u> <u>Law</u></p>\n<p>In this appeal the plaintiff also alleges a violation of her constitutional right to equal protection under law. (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 27.) The plaintiff argues that she has a fundamental right to appropriate medical care. She further maintains that DSS has failed to \"correct the disparities amongst applicants whose marital status changes while applying for assistance and that those whose status remains consistent.\" (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 29.) DSS contends that the plaintiff fails to state an equal protection violation, and that her claims are merely an expression of dissatisfaction with the FHO's decision \"cloaked in constitutional language.\" (Defendant's Brief, p. 19.) It further contends that these arguments were not asserted at the agency and should not be raised before the court.<sup id=\"ref-fn12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12</a></sup> (Defendant's Brief, p. 19.) Specifically, DSS argues that medical care is not a fundamental right in Connecticut, the government has no affirmative right to provide minimal subsistence to the poor and that the FHO's consideration of Adolfo Costa's death was entirely relevant to her decision and did not constitute marital discrimination. (Defendant's Brief, pp. 19-21.)</p>\n<p><blockquote>  The concept of equal protection [under the state and federal constitutions] has been traditionally viewed as requiring the uniform treatment of persons standing in the same relation to the governmental action questioned or challenged. . . . When, as here, a claimed equal protection violation arises from the alleged selective application of a facially neutral state regulation, it must be shown that (1) the person, compared with others similarly situated, was selectively treated, and (2) the selective treatment was motivated by an intention to discriminate on the basis of impermissible considerations, such as race or religion, to punish or inhibit the exercise of constitutional rights, or by a malicious or bad faith intent to injure the person.

Maher,</u> <cross_reference>40 Conn. Sup. 394</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>515 A.2d 134</cross_reference>\n(1986), in support of her equal protection argument. In <u>Doe,</u> the court found the state of Connecticut was obligated to fund all medically necessary abortions for poor women. Contrary to the plaintiff's assertions, the court did not hold that indigent people have a fundamental right to medical care. Furthermore, in <u>Moore v. Ganim,</u><cross_reference>233 Conn. 557</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>660 A.2d 742</cross_reference> (1995), the court held that the state did not have an obligation to provide indigent persons with a minimum level of subsistence or to provide substantial benefits to all citizens in need.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also cites to <u>Sheff v. O'Neill,</u> <cross_reference>238 Conn. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>678 A.2d 1267</cross_reference>\n(1996) in support of her argument. Briefly stated in <u>Sheff,</u> the court held that a disparity existed amongst school districts and the state's failure to address the disparities of the school children's education opportunities was an equal protection violation. The disparity alleged by the plaintiff here does not rise to the level addressed by the court in<u>Sheff</u>. In this case the opportunity at issue is whether the estate of Adolfo Costa is entitled to a greater share of the couple's marital assets for the potential distribution to his heirs, not the education of children.</p>\n<p>The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that her right to equal protection under the law was violated. There is no evidence in the record indicating that DSS sought to discriminate against the plaintiff or that her application for benefits was evaluated in a discriminatory manner.</p>\n<p>4.  <u>DSS Denied the Plaintiff's Application Based on Policy Which Had Not</u> <u>Been Promulgated in Accordance with the UAPA</u></p>\n<p>The plaintiff contends that her application for Title XIX benefits was denied based on a policy that had not been promulgated in accordance with the UAPA, had no basis in the administrative regulations and therefore cannot be enforced. (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 30, et seq.) DSS responds that the FHO's decision was not a regulation and that the FHO's decision stemmed from UPM &#167; 1570.25<sup id=\"ref-fn13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13</a></sup> which grants her the authority to increase the CSPA. (Defendant's Brief, p. 21.)</p>\n<p><blockquote>  The criteria that determine whether administrative action is a regulation are neither linguistic nor formalistic. It is not conclusive that an agency has, or has not, denominated its action a regulation or CT Page 10591 that it has, or has not, promulgated it procedurally in the fashion that would be required of a regulation. . . . The test is, rather, whether a rule has a substantial impact on the rights and obligations of parties who may appear before the agency in the future . . . Implicit in this formulation is the recognition that a regulation must be a rule of sufficient generality to impinge substantially on others who will deal with the agency at a future time.

Pac,</u> <cross_reference>183 Conn. 313</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>325-26</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>439 A.2d 349</cross_reference> (1981).</p>\n<p>Contrary to the plaintiff's assertions, the FHO's reconsidered decision was not \"misguided,\" did not \"[fly] in the face of relevant and controlling provisions\" nor did she exercise a \"blatant disregard for the law.\" (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 31.) Rather, the FHO executed her duty pursuant to UPM &#167; 1570.25 and properly concluded that Adolfo Costa did not require additional assets to produce a sufficient income to meet his MMNA. Furthermore, the FHO's final decision is commensurate with the public policy surrounding the MCCA, which is to prevent a community spouse from becoming impoverished when his or her spouse becomes institutionalized and not to preserve a couple's assets to be passed along to future generations. The FHO's decision was not a general rule that would substantially impinge on others that interact with the agency in the future, rather it was merely an assessment of the specific factual situation surrounding the plaintiff's application. Therefore, the court finds for DSS on this issue.</p>\n<p>5.  <u>DSS Committed Marital Discrimination in Violation of General Statutes</u> <u>&#167; <cross_reference>46a-64</cross_reference></u></p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues that \"the hearing officer revoked her prior fair hearing decision based in part, on the notion that a change in an applicant's marital status, although irrelevant for purposes of determining eligibility, could be a basis on which to deny an application for assistance.\" (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 33.) DSS contends that there is no support in the record that the FHO's final decision violated the Connecticut Public Accommodations Act by discriminating against Nancy Costa because of her change in marital status. (Defendant's Brief, p. 22.) General Statutes &#167; <cross_reference>46a-64</cross_reference> provides that:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  (a) It shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section: (1) To deny any person within the jurisdiction of this state full and equal CT Page 10592 accommodations in any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, age, lawful source of income, mental retardation, mental disability or physical disability, including, but not limited to, blindness or deafness of the applicant, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to all persons; (2) to discriminate, segregate or separate on account of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, age, lawful source of income, mental retardation, mental disability, learning disability or physical disability, including, but not limited to, blindness or deafness. . . .</blockquote></p>\n<p>There is no evidence to support the plaintiff's assertion that DSS's application processing procedures are discriminatory in nature. The FHO's decision in this specific instance was based on a determination that there was no longer a need for the community spouse to have an increased CSPA. It was not based on Nancy Costa's change in marital status. Accordingly the court finds for DSS on this claim of error.</p>\n<p><center>                             VI. <u>CONCLUSION</u></center>\nThe trial court's role on appeal is not to substitute its own judgment for that of DSS or to retry the case. Instead, the court must sustain the agency's factual determinations and affirm its decision if there is substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole to support it.<u>Newtown v.

In addition, this court finds that the FHO correctly applied the law to the facts. \"Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\" <u>O'Callaghan v.

The FHO issued a written decision dated May 19, 1999, that included findings of fact and conclusions of law. (ROR, May 19, 1999 Hearing Decision, pp. 1-5.) The FHO disagreed with the denial of Title XIX benefits and directed the regional office to increase the CSPA, provided all other eligibility factors were met. (ROR, May 19, 1999 Hearing Decision, pp. 1-5.) On May 25, 1999, the FHO learned that the community spouse,<sup id=\"ref-fn2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> Adolfo Costa, had died even before the administrative hearing was requested by the institutionalized spouse.<sup id=\"ref-fn3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117.)

The decision provided in relevant part:</p>\n<p><center>                               <u>DISCUSSION</u></center><blockquote>  It was not shown in this hearing that during the lifetime of the applicant's spouse, in order to avoid impoverishment, he needed to retain more than the amount of his spousal share of the couple's total assets, as determined by the Department on November 24, 1998. The community spouse's needs ceased at his death. He therefore did not need to have his CSPA increased for the purpose of meeting his MMNA. That is the only purpose for which a hearing officer can increase a CSPA which has been correctly determined by the regional office staff. The applicant's CSPA cannot be increased.</p>\n<p>  The applicant's spouse did have an MMNA from the date of his wife's application for Medicaid until the date of his death. During this period his spousal share of the couple's assets, $81,690.00, combined with his income, was sufficient to meet his MMNA. Since it was not necessary to increase this CSPA in order to prevent impoverishment of this community spouse I have found that this CSPA may not be increased.

The plaintiff further contends \"the purpose of the `Spousal Impoverishment' rules is to prevent the impoverishment of the community spouse, the ruling of the DSS in this case is counter to the spirit and intent of the federal scheme.\" (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 7.)</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also argues that she was deprived of her due process protections by the FHO's reversal of the March 2, 1999 decision granting her Medicaid benefits because she had a protected property interest in CT Page 10583 those benefits. In this regard she contends that she was entitled to: (1) notice and a hearing prior to the Department's revocation of her benefits; (2) timely and adequate notice of a proposed benefit termination pursuant to UPM &#167; 1500.01;<sup id=\"ref-fn7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup> and (3) an opportunity to present or address evidence or arguments.

In addition, the plaintiff contends that her first opportunity to be heard was untimely as it occurred eight months after she applied for benefits and that she did not receive adequate notice pursuant to UPM &#167; 1500.01. (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 20.)</p>\n<p>DSS contends that, \"[t]he crux of the community spouse provisions are to prevent impoverishment of the community spouse. Consideration of the community spouse's \"needs' only makes sense if the spouse is alive.

DSS asserts that the hearing process was impeded because the plaintiff neglected to provide the department with accurate facts, i.e., that her spouse had died two months prior to the hearing. (Defendant's Brief, p. 11.) DSS further argues that the plaintiff had no property interest in receiving benefits because her application had not been approved. (Defendant's Brief, p. 13.) DSS further contends that the FHO's conclusions were supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record and were well within the FHO's discretion. (Defendant's Brief, p. 16, et seq.) Finally, with regard to the adequacy of notice, DSS argues that the FHO's June 2, 1999 notice of reconsideration stated that pursuant to General Statutes &#167; <cross_reference>4-181a</cross_reference> (a) the record was being reopened and that the FHO's intent was quite clear based on the questions she posed to the parties.

Prior to 1988, the medicaid eligibility rules required couples to deplete their combined resources before the institutionalized spouse was eligible for benefits, often leaving the community spouse financially vulnerable. The MCCA attempted to strike a balance between preventing impoverishment of the community spouse by excluding minimum amounts of resources and income for that spouse from eligibility considerations, and preventing a financially solvent institutionalized spouse from receiving Medicaid benefits by ensuring that income was not completely transferred to the community spouse.</blockquote></p>\n<p><u>O'Callaghan v.

DSS denied the plaintiff's application for long term nursing home medical assistance because, on the date of her institutionalization, her assets, $65,567.98, exceeded the agency's asset limit of $1600. (ROR, Hearing Summary, p. 21; ROR, Assessment of Spousal Assets, p. 32.)</p>\n<p>The purpose of the March 2, 1999, fair hearing, convened by the FHO, was to permit the plaintiff to have the opportunity to attempt to establish a need to increase the CSPA in order to generate enough income to meet Adolfo Costa's MMNA. (ROR, Transcript, p. 148.) The plaintiff's attorney presented evidence at the hearing in support of the position that the CSPA should be increased because Adolfo Costa had insufficient income to meet his MMNA. (ROR, Transcript, pp. 150 et seq.) At the time of the March 2, 1999 hearing, the FHO was unaware that Adolfo Costa was dead. In fact, the record reflects that he died on December 27, 1998, approximately two months earlier. (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117) Neither the plaintiff's attorney nor her daughter, who had been granted her mother's power of attorney, informed the FHO that the community spouse had since died. In fact, references were made throughout the hearing from which it was reasonable to conclude CT Page 10586 that Adolfo Costa was still alive, e.g., the initial application for benefits was presented as a full exhibit (ROR, Transcript, p. 152), and the plaintiff's attorney informed the FHO that he was the attorney for both Adolfo and Nancy Costa (ROR, Transcript, p. 143.) It was not until January 4, 1999, or approximately nine days after the community spouse's untimely death that the surviving spouse even requested a fair hearing to contest the denial of Nancy Costa's Title XIX application for Medicaid assistance and to increase the CSPA. (ROR, January 4, 1999 request for fair hearing, p. 75.)</p>\n<p>Approximately six days after issuing her May 19, 1999 decision, the FHO discovered that Adolfo Costa had in fact died almost five months earlier on December 27, 1998.<sup id=\"ref-fn9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup> (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117.) Having learned this new information, the FHO reopened the record and requested additional information from the parties. (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117.)</p>\n<p>The plaintiff claims she was deprived of her due process protections by the FHO's reversal of the May 19, 1999 decision because she had a protected property interest in receiving Title XIX benefits. The constitution of Connecticut, article <cross_reference>first</cross_reference>, &#167; <cross_reference>10</cross_reference> and the due process clause of the United States Constitution prohibits state actors from depriving individuals of property or liberty without due process.

The plaintiff's reliance under the facts in this case is in error because in this instance she had no vested interest in Medicaid benefits. Nancy Costa was to be awarded Title XIX benefits \"provided all other eligibility factors ha[d] been met.\" (ROR, May 19, 1999 Hearing Decision, p. 4.) The FHO's initial decision to award benefits was contingent on all other eligibility factors being met. It is reasonable for a FHO to consider a community spouse being alive as an eligibility factor when determining whether a CSPA should be increased in order to avoid the community spouse's impoverishment. Hence, where the FHO later discovered this eligibility requirement was not fulfilled the benefits were not awarded. As the plaintiff's application for Medicaid benefits had never been approved, there could be no termination that violated her due process rights. Therefore, the FHO's decision to deny the plaintiff's CT Page 10587 application did not violate her due process.</p>\n<p>The court has determined that the plaintiff failed to obtain a property interest in the Title XIX benefits. In addition, the court has determined that the due process accorded was sufficient in this instance. \"Inquiry into whether particular procedures are constitutionally mandated in a given instance requires adherence to the principle that due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. There is no per se rule that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever a liberty interest may be affected. Due process . . . is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances. . . .\" (Citations omitted.) <u>State v.

Therefore, the court deems it unnecessary to discuss the issue further other than to note that both parties had adequate notice that Adolfo Costa's death was at issue by virtue of the FHO's correspondence dated June 2, 1999 and that each party was given ample opportunity to respond and address the FHO and neither choose to present additional evidence, argument or request an administrative hearing. (ROR, June 2, 1999 Notice of Reconsideration, p. 117; ROR, DSS responses, pp. 43-44, Plaintiff's response, p. 112.)</p>\n<p>In the present case, the community spouse died before the institutionalized spouse requested a fair hearing to contest her eligibility of benefits. A hearing was then held to determine if the community spouse's income should be increased in order to meet his MMNA, at which time no one informed the FHO that Adolfo Costa was dead. The FHO's ensuing decision was based on the premise that Adolfo Costa was still alive and she granted Adolfo Costa an increase in his CSPA, due to the insufficiency in his monthly income \"provided all other eligibility factors have been met.\" (ROR, May 19, 1999 Hearing Decision, p. 4.). Once the complete set of facts was established it was reasonable for the FHO to conclude that the community spouse had no unmet needs.</p>\n<p>Given the policy behind the MCCA, the court finds that the FHO was correct in rendering her corrected reconsidered decision. As previously indicated, \"[t]he legislative history of the MCCA establishes that Congress sought to end the pauperization of community spouses by assuring that the community spouse has a sufficient &#8212; but not excessive &#8212; amount of income and resources available to her while her spouse is in a nursing home.

App.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></span></cross_reference>. Here, the plaintiff did not establish CT Page 10588 that the community spouse had insufficient resources during his lifetime. Only when a community spouse requires income generated by the institutionalized spouse's share of the couple's assets to meet his MMNA is the FHO authorized to increase the CSPA.<sup id=\"ref-fn10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup> In this case, the FHO concluded the community spouse had sufficient income and resources to meet his needs in the community from the date of the plaintiff's institutionalization to the time of his death and had no need for an increased CSPA. (ROR, April 19, 2000 Corrected Reconsidered Decision, pp. 12-16.)</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also argues that her first opportunity to be heard, eight months after her application for benefits, was untimely. However, the record discloses that the plaintiff waited approximately six months from the time she applied for benefits to request a hearing. DSS could not conduct the hearing until it was requested by the plaintiff, and once she requested the hearing it was held within two months.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff also claims that, pursuant to General Statutes &#167;<cross_reference>17b-61</cross_reference>,<sup id=\"ref-fn11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11</a></sup> the FHO officer was mandated to issue an opinion within 60 days and her failure to do so invalidates the decision. The defendant argues that the term \"shall\" is directory and not mandatory. It has been held that \"the time period for the hearing officer to render a decision is not mandatory but directory\" and that an \"untimely decision is not void.\" <u>Reynolds v. Dept. of Social Services,</u> Superior Court, judicial district of Litchfield, Docket No. 79927 (June 9, 2000, <em>DiPentima, J</em>.) (<cross_reference>27 Conn.L.Rptr. 303</cross_reference>). In support of this proposition, the court quoted<u>Angelsea Productions, Inc. v.

No penalty is imposed. The statute does not provide that the failure to render a decision within the specified time entitles the person to an automatic granting of the relief sought. The statute appears to be designed to promote convenience, efficiency and dispatch in the rendering of decisions.\" <u>Lucas v. Dept. of Social</u><u>Services,</u> Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. 488956 (July 21, 2000, <em>Hartmere, J</em>.).</p>\n<p>The FHO did not compromise the purpose of the statute by failing to render a decision within sixty days of closing the record. This court agrees that the time period for rendering a decision is merely directory. Here, particularly, the FHO was justified in taking an CT Page 10589 extended period of time to render her decision in light of the plaintiff's nondisclosure of the community spouse's actual status.</p>\n<p>The court finds that, based upon the law and the substantial evidence in the record, the FHO's conclusion that the community spouse had no unmet needs and did not warrant an increased CSPA was not unreasonable, arbitrary, illegal, or in abuse of its discretion. Furthermore, the court finds that the plaintiff was accorded the appropriate due process under the circumstances presented.</p>\n<p>3.  <u>DSS's Conduct Denied the Plaintiff Equal Protection Under the</u> <u>Law</u></p>\n<p>In this appeal the plaintiff also alleges a violation of her constitutional right to equal protection under law. (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 27.) The plaintiff argues that she has a fundamental right to appropriate medical care. She further maintains that DSS has failed to \"correct the disparities amongst applicants whose marital status changes while applying for assistance and that those whose status remains consistent.\" (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 29.) DSS contends that the plaintiff fails to state an equal protection violation, and that her claims are merely an expression of dissatisfaction with the FHO's decision \"cloaked in constitutional language.\" (Defendant's Brief, p. 19.) It further contends that these arguments were not asserted at the agency and should not be raised before the court.<sup id=\"ref-fn12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12</a></sup> (Defendant's Brief, p. 19.) Specifically, DSS argues that medical care is not a fundamental right in Connecticut, the government has no affirmative right to provide minimal subsistence to the poor and that the FHO's consideration of Adolfo Costa's death was entirely relevant to her decision and did not constitute marital discrimination. (Defendant's Brief, pp. 19-21.)</p>\n<p><blockquote>  The concept of equal protection [under the state and federal constitutions] has been traditionally viewed as requiring the uniform treatment of persons standing in the same relation to the governmental action questioned or challenged. . . . When, as here, a claimed equal protection violation arises from the alleged selective application of a facially neutral state regulation, it must be shown that (1) the person, compared with others similarly situated, was selectively treated, and (2) the selective treatment was motivated by an intention to discriminate on the basis of impermissible considerations, such as race or religion, to punish or inhibit the exercise of constitutional rights, or by a malicious or bad faith intent to injure the person.

In <u>Doe,</u> the court found the state of Connecticut was obligated to fund all medically necessary abortions for poor women.

Briefly stated in <u>Sheff,</u> the court held that a disparity existed amongst school districts and the state's failure to address the disparities of the school children's education opportunities was an equal protection violation. The disparity alleged by the plaintiff here does not rise to the level addressed by the court in<u>Sheff</u>. In this case the opportunity at issue is whether the estate of Adolfo Costa is entitled to a greater share of the couple's marital assets for the potential distribution to his heirs, not the education of children.</p>\n<p>The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that her right to equal protection under the law was violated. There is no evidence in the record indicating that DSS sought to discriminate against the plaintiff or that her application for benefits was evaluated in a discriminatory manner.</p>\n<p>4.  <u>DSS Denied the Plaintiff's Application Based on Policy Which Had Not</u> <u>Been Promulgated in Accordance with the UAPA</u></p>\n<p>The plaintiff contends that her application for Title XIX benefits was denied based on a policy that had not been promulgated in accordance with the UAPA, had no basis in the administrative regulations and therefore cannot be enforced. (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 30, et seq.) DSS responds that the FHO's decision was not a regulation and that the FHO's decision stemmed from UPM &#167; 1570.25<sup id=\"ref-fn13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13</a></sup> which grants her the authority to increase the CSPA. (Defendant's Brief, p. 21.)</p>\n<p><blockquote>  The criteria that determine whether administrative action is a regulation are neither linguistic nor formalistic. It is not conclusive that an agency has, or has not, denominated its action a regulation or CT Page 10591 that it has, or has not, promulgated it procedurally in the fashion that would be required of a regulation. . . . The test is, rather, whether a rule has a substantial impact on the rights and obligations of parties who may appear before the agency in the future . . . Implicit in this formulation is the recognition that a regulation must be a rule of sufficient generality to impinge substantially on others who will deal with the agency at a future time.

Rather, the FHO executed her duty pursuant to UPM &#167; 1570.25 and properly concluded that Adolfo Costa did not require additional assets to produce a sufficient income to meet his MMNA. Furthermore, the FHO's final decision is commensurate with the public policy surrounding the MCCA, which is to prevent a community spouse from becoming impoverished when his or her spouse becomes institutionalized and not to preserve a couple's assets to be passed along to future generations. The FHO's decision was not a general rule that would substantially impinge on others that interact with the agency in the future, rather it was merely an assessment of the specific factual situation surrounding the plaintiff's application. Therefore, the court finds for DSS on this issue.</p>\n<p>5.  <u>DSS Committed Marital Discrimination in Violation of General Statutes</u> <u>&#167; <cross_reference>46a-64</cross_reference></u></p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues that \"the hearing officer revoked her prior fair hearing decision based in part, on the notion that a change in an applicant's marital status, although irrelevant for purposes of determining eligibility, could be a basis on which to deny an application for assistance.\" (Plaintiff's Brief, p. 33.) DSS contends that there is no support in the record that the FHO's final decision violated the Connecticut Public Accommodations Act by discriminating against Nancy Costa because of her change in marital status. (Defendant's Brief, p. 22.) General Statutes &#167; <cross_reference>46a-64</cross_reference> provides that:</p>\n<p><blockquote>  (a) It shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section: (1) To deny any person within the jurisdiction of this state full and equal CT Page 10592 accommodations in any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, age, lawful source of income, mental retardation, mental disability or physical disability, including, but not limited to, blindness or deafness of the applicant, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to all persons; (2) to discriminate, segregate or separate on account of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, age, lawful source of income, mental retardation, mental disability, learning disability or physical disability, including, but not limited to, blindness or deafness. . . .</blockquote></p>\n<p>There is no evidence to support the plaintiff's assertion that DSS's application processing procedures are discriminatory in nature. The FHO's decision in this specific instance was based on a determination that there was no longer a need for the community spouse to have an increased CSPA. It was not based on Nancy Costa's change in marital status. Accordingly the court finds for DSS on this claim of error.</p>\n<p><center>                             VI. <u>CONCLUSION</u></center>\nThe trial court's role on appeal is not to substitute its own judgment for that of DSS or to retry the case.

This body of law was created specifically to enable the spouse to have adequate income and resources to CT Page 10593 live independently in the community. The \"fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\"<u>State v.

Furthermore, \"[i]f a statute is capable of two constructions, one that is rational and effective in accomplishing the evident legislative object, and the other leading to \"bizarre results' destructive of that purpose, the former should prevail.\" Id., 23. The MCCA was not promulgated for estate planning purposes or to shelter assets for heirs.
