That important issue arose in\n\nthe following context:\n\n                            STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n      A pipeline constructed by Copano required land held by Appellee John\n\nAshcraft, individually and as trustee of the John Ashcraft Family Trust 2012.\n\n(CR:4.) Copano’s petition to condemn the land was assigned to the 23rd District\n\nCourt of Matagorda County, Texas, the Honorable Ben Hardin presiding.\n\n      On April 21, 2015, the special commissioners’ award was filed with the trial\n\ncourt, but it took until May 27 for the clerk to mail the notice in the manner\n\nrequired by TEXAS PROPERTY CODE § 21.049.           (CR:29, 93.)    Copano timely\n\nobjected to the award on May 19. (CR:91.) But, Ashcraft moved for entry of\n\njudgment on the award, arguing that the May 19 objections were untimely and the\n\ntrial court must adopt the Special Commissioners’ award as its judgment. (CR:94.)\n\n      The trial court entered judgment on the award (CR:151), necessitating this\n\nappeal. (CR:205.)\n\f                     STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      Copano believes the mistaken statutory construction that resulted in the\n\ndenial of jurisdiction over an administrative award for property taken by\n\ncondemnation merits full discussion of the issues and opportunity to address this\n\ncourt’s questions.\n\n                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      The Supreme Court has consistently held that the Legislature enacted\n\nSection 21.049 of the Texas Property Code to toll the time prescribed by Section\n\n21.018 for parties to file objections that trigger a district court’s jurisdiction over\n\nan appeal from a special commissioners’ decision in a condemnation. It has also\n\nheld that Section 21.049’s specific requirement (that “[n]ot later than the next\n\nworking day after the [commissioners’] decision is filed, the clerk shall send notice\n\nof the decision by certified or registered United States mail … to the parties in the\n\nproceeding, or to their attorneys of record”) is “mandatory” and must be strictly\n\ncomplied with before the time for objections can begin to run. The provision must\n\nbe interpreted to promote, rather than limit, the parties’ right to appeal.\n\n      1.     Did the district court err in entering judgment on the special\n             commissioners’ award, and dismissing Copano’s appeal, even\n             though Copano’s objections to the award were filed prior to 20\n             days after the clerk gave the requisite notice by certified mail?\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f      2.     Can filing findings of fact and conclusions of law in the absence\n             of an evidentiary hearing, disputed facts, or evidence, alter an\n             error of law in dismissing an appeal from a commissioners’\n             award for want of jurisdiction, and entering judgment on the\n             award instead?\n\n                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      This appeal presents a pure question of law: whether Copano timely filed its\n\nobjections to the special commissioners’ award. The facts forming the context for\n\nthis legal question are straightforward.\n\n      The Copano Sweeny NGL Pipeline will transport natural gas liquids twenty-\n\nthree miles from the Eagle Ford Shale to purchasers and processors in Sweeny,\n\nTexas. (CR:5-6.) Copano will own and operate the pipeline. (Id.) The pipeline\n\nrequired a narrow easement across Ashcraft’s property that totaled about eight\n\nacres. (CR:7-9, 16.)\n\n      Copano and Ashcraft disagreed about the easement’s value, so Copano\n\nexercised its power of eminent domain by filing a petition for condemnation under\n\nTEXAS PROPERTY CODE § 21.012. (CR:5.) The district court appointed special\n\ncommissioners to value the easement as required by Tex. Prop. Code § 21.014.\n\n(CR:24.) On April 21, 2015, the special commissioners issued their award of well\n\nover a million dollars for the eight acre easement. (CR:31.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f        The Texas Property Code sets forth what must happen next. Section 21.049\n\nrequires two things. First, the judge hearing the case must inform the clerk of the\n\nspecial commissioners’ decision within one working day after the decision is filed.\n\nSecond, the clerk must immediately mail notice of the award to the parties by\n\ncertified or registered United States mail, return receipt requested:\n\n        Not later than the next working day after the day the decision is filed,\n        the clerk shall send notice of the decision by certified or registered\n        United States mail, return receipt requested, to the parties in the\n        proceeding, or to their attorneys of record, at their addresses of record.\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE § 21.049. Here, the clerk’s office failed to discharge that duty.\n\n        The duties are important because a party may appeal from the\n\ncommissioners’ findings by filing a statement of its objections under Texas\n\nProperty Code § 21.018.\n\n        On the day the special commissioners issued their award, April 21, 2015,\n\nCopano electronically filed the award with the district clerk. (CR:29.) Copano\n\nspecifically reminded the clerk of its duty to mail notice in the manner required by\n\nTexas Property Code § 21.049:\n\n\n\n\n(Id.)\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f      But the clerk’s office did not mail the award until May 27, 2015, more than a\n\nmonth later. (CR:93.)\n\n      Copano filed its objections early – on May 19, 2015. (CR:91.) Thus, the\n\ntrial court should have proceeded to “try the case in the same manner as other civil\n\ncauses,” as required by Section 21.018(b).\n\n      But, notwithstanding Section 21.049 Ashcraft filed a Motion for Entry of\n\nJudgment claiming that the deadline for objections was actually May 18 under\n\nSection 21.018. (CR:94.) Ashcraft asserted that the district court had to “adopt the\n\ncommissioners’ findings as the judgment of the court” (Id.; see TEX. PROP. CODE\n\n§ 21.061.) The motion for judgment dealt with the clerk’s delay, which tolled the\n\ndeadine for objections, by ignoring it. (CR:94.)\n\n      Copano’s response pointed out that the Supreme Court held that a clerk’s\n\ndelay in mailing the notice tolls the deadline for objections, and that even actual\n\nnotice of the award provides no exception to this mandatory tolling rule.\n\n(CR:118.)    Nevertheless, the trial court entered judgment on the special\n\ncommissioners’ award. (CR:151.) Copano timely appealed. (CR:205.)\n\n      After Copano appealed to this Court, Ashcraft raised new and untested\n\narguments about the effect of Copano’s electronic filing of the special\n\ncommissioners’ award by proposing findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(SCR:4-12.) Copano objected to the request because findings and conclusions may\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fnot be entered in cases where no evidentiary hearing was held, and because\n\nAshcraft sought to inject new legal theories after judgment was entered. (SCR:23.)\n\n      The trial court did not hold an evidentiary hearing on Ashcraft’s Motion for\n\nEntry of Judgment, nor did Ashcraft proffer evidence in support of its motion\n\n(CR:94), no doubt because the only material relevant “facts” are undisputed and\n\nministerial – the date when the special commissioners’ award was filed, the date\n\nwhen the clerk mailed that award to the parties, and the date Copano filed its\n\nobjections. (SCR:9.) But the trial court signed the findings and conclusions\n\nproposed by Ashcraft, without changing a word. (SCR:17.)\n\n                             SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial court denied Copano’s statutory right of a trial de novo to appeal\n\nthe special commissioners’ condemnation award. That error was based on the trial\n\ncourt’s failure:\n\n      (i)    to follow Supreme Court precedent tolling the due date for\n             filing jurisdiction-triggering objections to the award (that has\n             guided litigants since 1992); and\n\n      (ii)   to understand that the Legislature enacts statutes containing\n             mandatory provisions that set forth the precise type of notice\n             that must be given to trigger district courts’ jurisdiction over\n             condemnation awards and the critical difference between their\n             mandatory notice requirements and:\n\n                   − actual notice; or\n\n                   − notice of an e-filing.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      Instead, the trial court wrongly determined that the Legislature’s mandatory,\n\nparty-neutral requirement that the clerks send notice by certified mail was enacted\n\nsolely to benefit landowners.\n\n      That series of errors has denied Copano access to the courts and due process\n\nguaranteed by our Constitution and statutes, as consistently interpreted by our\n\nSupreme Court. It requires swift reversal.\n\n                             BRIEF OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      Jurisdiction over a judicial review of an administrative determination –\n\nespecially when it involves taking of and compensation for property – cannot be\n\ntaken lightly. Here, the district court interpreted the Supreme Court’s construction\n\nof a jurisdiction-tolling statute that was enacted to encourage appeals, to achieve\n\nthe opposite result. It refused jurisdiction that the Legislature enacted a statute to\n\nensure.\n\nI.    Copano’s Objections Were Timely Filed, Invoking the District Court’s\n      Jurisdiction.\n\n      A.     The statutes that frame jurisdiction tolled the time for filing\n             objections.\n\n      The trial court’s jurisdiction over a commissioners’ award is governed by the\n\nfollowing.\n\n      First, Section 21.049 requires two actions immediately upon the trial court’s\n\nreceipt of the commissioners’ report containing their decision:\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      (i)    “The judge of a court hearing a proceeding under this chapter\n             shall inform the clerk of the court as to a decision by the special\n             commissioners on the day the decision is filed or on the next\n             working date after the day the decision is filed.”\n\n      (ii)   “Not later than the next working day after the day the decision\n             is filed, the clerk shall send notice of the decision by certified\n             or registered United States mail, return receipt requested, to the\n             parties in the proceeding, or to their attorneys of record, at their\n             addresses of record.”\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE § 21.049 (emphasis added).\n\n      Second, a party’s written statement of its objections to the award “must be\n\nfiled on or before the first Monday following the 20th day after the day the\n\ncommissioners’ file their findings with the court.” TEX. PROP. CODE § 21.018(a).\n\nTimely notice by the clerk of the commissioners’ decision in the form prescribed\n\nby the Legislature is therefore critical because the trial court must enter “the\n\ncommissioners’ findings as the judgment of the court” unless the parties timely\n\nobject to the commissioners’ report. TEX. PROP. CODE § 21.061.\n\n      The question of law that the district court got wrong is whether the clerk’s\n\nfailure to comply with Section 21.049’s precise requirement of notice by certified\n\nmailing tolls the deadline in Section 21.018. The Supreme Court definitively has\n\nanswered that question.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      B.     The deadline for making jurisdiction-triggering objections to the\n             commissioner’s award does not begin until the clerk complies\n             with Section 21.049.\n\n      The Supreme Court has repeatedly answered the question by holding that the\n\nnotice required by the Legislature in Section 21.049 is “mandatory.” John v. State,\n\n826 S.W.2d 138, 140 & n.3 (Tex. 1992). That means the “time to object” to the\n\nspecial commissioners’ award “is tolled until the clerk sends the required notice\n\npursuant to section 21.049.” Id. at 141 (emphasis added).\n\n      The requirement is mandatory for jurisdiction over appeals by all parties,\n\neven though John spoke in terms of tolling the time for the landowner’s objections.\n\nThe Court subsequently made it clear that the “time for making objections” that\n\ntrigger the trial court’s jurisdiction is tolled “if the parties are not given proper\n\nnotice” as required by Section 21.049. Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. A.P.I. Pipe and\n\nSupply, LLC, 397 S.W.3d 162, 167 n.18 (Tex. 2013) (emphasis added) (citing\n\nJohn, 826 S.W.2d at 141 n.5).        The Supreme Court has never varied from\n\nconstruing Section 21.049’s clerk’s notice by certified mail requirement as tolling\n\nthe time allotted by the more general statute, Section 21.018, until the clerk sends\n\n“proper” notice in the form prescribed by the Legislature.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f      C.     Courts cannot vary the form of notice mandated by the\n             Legislature for triggering the district court’s jurisdiction.\n\n             1.    Actual notice will not suffice.\n\n      Courts are bound by the Legislature’s requirement. Thus, not even actual\n\nnotice by a clerk personally handing a party’s attorney “a file-stamped copy of the\n\nnotice” of the commissioners’ decision will be allowed to substitute for Section\n\n21.049’s requirement that the clerk give notice by certified mail. Oncor Elec.\n\nDelivery Co. v. Schunke, No. 04-13-00067-CV, 2013 WL 6672494, *3 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio Dec. 18, 2013, pet. dism’d).\n\n      A mandatory notice statute means that it must be strictly applied. See\n\nSchepps v. Presbyterian Hosp. of Dallas, 652 S.W.2d 934, 936-38 (Tex. 1983). By\n\ncontrast, when a statute’s notice requirement can be satisfied by actual notice, it\n\nsays so. See, e.g., First Nat’l Bank in Graham v. Sledge, 653 S.W.2d 283, 287\n\n(Tex. 1983). Thus, actual knowledge of an award by an attorney filing it and\n\nreceiving a file-stamped copy from the clerk will not satisfy the clerk’s duty to\n\ngive “proper” statutory notice by mailing the notice of decision as required by\n\nSection 21.049. Oncor at *3-4.\n\n      Equally important, in Oncor the court also recognized that parties are\n\n“entitled to rely on the rule articulated in John” in calculating the time for filing\n\ntheir objections to the award. Id. at *4. That has been the law since John was\n\ndecided in 1992, and that is what Copano did here.\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             2.     E-filing will not suffice.\n\n      After this appeal was filed, Ashcraft sought to raise an equally unavailing\n\ntheory by going beyond the record for findings and conclusions regarding notice\n\nby e-filing. But if being handed a file-stamped copy of the award does not satisfy\n\nthe clerk’s “mandatory” duty to immediately give notice by certified mail, an\n\nelectronic notice of filing will hardly suffice for proper compliance. Thus, the trial\n\ncourt’s belated finding of notice by e-filing cannot save the judgment for three\n\nindependent reasons.\n\n      First, the clerk’s office, having been specifically cautioned of its duty to\n\nmail the award to the parties, performed that duty on May 27, 2015, indicating that\n\nthe clerk’s office knew that its duty had to be performed via the U.S. mail.\n\n      Second, there is no evidence that the commissioners’ decision containing\n\ntheir award was “e-mailed” to Copano’s counsel on April 21, or any other day.\n\n(Copano believes that a hearing would have established that the clerk has no record\n\nof emailing notice.)\n\n      And if “emailing” is referring to e-filing the award, there is again no\n\nevidence when or even if the file-marked award was electronically sent to\n\nCopano’s counsel. Instead, the argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding\n\nof the process, which, again, is not in the record:\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      Within minutes of e-filing the award, a “filing-submitted” reply transmits the\n\nfact of filing, but not a copy of what was filed. Thus, a file-stamp on a document\n\nsubsequently accepted for filing does not mean the document was actually\n\nreturned that day.    The same procedure applies to a later “filing accepted”\n\nelectronic reply, though it supplies a link to a file-stamped copy on the\n\neFile.Texas.gov server.\n\n      Neither is of record, though Copano believes the trial court’s electronic\n\ndocket would show the “e-filing” was not “accepted” until May 1. That means that\n\neven if access to a link showed for the first time on May 1, that Copano’s filing\n\nwas “accepted” the availability of a link cannot substitute for the mandatory\n\nstatutory requirement of certified mail. But even if a “filing accepted” notice could\n\nbe substituted for the Legislature’s mandatory certified mail notice provision\n\n(which it cannot), Copano’s May 19 filing would be timely even under Ashcraft’s\n\nbelated theory.\n\n      Third, courts cannot by rule negate or alter statutory requirements enacted\n\nby the Legislature. The Supreme Court always recognizes that its rule-making\n\npower is limited to establishing rules and procedures “not inconsistent with the law\n\nof the State” by former Art. V, Sec. 25 of the Texas Constitution. Thus, “when a\n\nrule of the court conflicts with a legislative enactment, the rule must yield.” Few v.\n\nCharter Oak Fire Ins. Co., 463 S.W.2d 424, 425 (Tex. 1971).\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      As a result, neither Section 21.049’s certified mailing requirement, nor its\n\ntolling of Section 21.018’s filing deadline, can be repealed or altered by Rule 21’s\n\nelectronic filing and service provisions any more than Rule 21a’s personal service\n\nprovision could alter it.\n\n      Thus, Legislative tolling until mandatory statutory requirements are satisfied\n\ncannot be circumvented by hand delivery or service by access to e-filing links.\n\nThe mandatory requirement of Section 21.049 was not satisfied until after\n\nCopano’s objections were timely filed.\n\n      D.     Liberal construction        cannot   rewrite   the   statute   or   its\n             requirements.\n\n      Ultimately Ashcraft must rely on liberal construction in favor of the\n\nlandowner to rewrite both the Legislature’s clear notice by certified mail\n\nrequirement in Section 21.049 and the Supreme Court’s consistent interpretation of\n\nthat requirement. That argument for denying jurisdiction over Copano’s appeal\n\nflounders in two fundamental ways.\n\n      First, the goal of liberal construction is to ensure that “the right of appeal\n\nshould not be lost due to procedural technicalities.”       Roccaforte v. Jefferson\n\nCounty, 341 S.W.3d 919, 924 (Tex. 2011) (citing Guest v. Dixon, 195 S.W.3d 687,\n\n688 (Tex. 2006); Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Estate of Gonzalez, 820 S.W.2d 121-22\n\n(Tex. 1991) (liberal construction requires “decisions of the courts of appeals turn\n\non substance rather than procedural technicality”)).\n\n\n                                         13\n\f      Ashcraft and the trial court missed the point of why statutes are liberally\n\nconstrued – to ensure jurisdiction over appeals, not to deny it. See, e.g., State v.\n\nTexas Titan Land Dev., Inc., No. 01-14-00899-CV, 2015 WL 3637982, at *5 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] June 11, 2015, pet. filed) (holding that under liberal\n\nconstruction, Section 21.018’s time requirement is determined by the “mandatory”\n\nmailing requirement in Section 21.049, and may not logically reduce the State’s\n\ntime to object to an award, requiring reversal of the dismissal of the State’s\n\nappeal).\n\n      Indeed, it makes no sense for a party benefitting from liberal construction\n\ndesigned to enable an appeal, to turn around and use it to prevent an appeal.\n\nLiberal construction cannot eliminate a tolling statute that grants a right of appeal\n\nto both parties.\n\n      Second, liberal construction “must remain grounded in the statute’s\n\nlanguage.” Greater Houston P’ship v. Paxton, --S.W.3d--, No. 13-0745, 2015 WL\n\n3978138, at *8 (Tex. June 26, 2015). It is not “tantamount to boundless reach.”\n\nId. at *12. Instead, like “any other extra-textual construct,” liberal construction\n\nmust yield to “plain and unambiguous language.” Id.\n\n      That is what we have here – plain and unambiguous language requiring\n\nnotice by certified mail to all “parties,” that is consistently interpreted by the\n\nSupreme Court to require tolling the jurisdiction window for objecting to\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fcommissioners’ awards. The goals of the Legislature and the Court are the same –\n\nreaching the merits of a party’s appeal of a condemnation award.\n\n      To sum up, Ashcraft is asking this Court to make law by ignoring Supreme\n\nCourt holdings that the deadline for filing objections is tolled until the clerk\n\ncomplies with the mandatory provisions of Section 21.049 by giving notice by\n\ncertified mail. Here as in Oncor the parties had every right to rely on both the\n\nLegislature’s mandatory provision and Supreme Court precedent construing it.\n\nThe district court erred in entering judgment on the commissioners’ findings. It\n\nmust be reversed so Copano can have its day in court.\n\nII.   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Are Not Only Immaterial,\n      They Are Erroneous.\n\n      Rather than supporting Ashcraft’s judgment, the trial court’s immaterial and\n\nerroneous findings of fact and conclusions of law reveal instead that when\n\njurisdiction is decided as a pure question of law, findings and conclusions cannot\n\nbe made in the absence of evidentiary hearings, let alone absent evidence of\n\ndisputed facts. They create a false illusion of resolving facts when none were\n\nheard or needed to be decided.\n\n      Thus, where the trial court renders judgment without an evidentiary hearing,\n\n“findings and conclusions have no purpose and should not be requested, made, or\n\nconsidered on appeal.” IKB Indus. (Nigeria) Ltd. v. Pro-Line Corp., 938 S.W.2d\n\n440, 442-43 (Tex. 1997). “Therefore, even when the trial court receives evidence,\n\n\n                                        15\n\ffindings and conclusions are only appropriate if the trial court is called upon to\n\ndetermine questions of fact upon conflicting evidence.” Black v. Shor, 443 S.W.3d\n\n154, 166 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi-Edinburg 2013, pet. denied) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n       Ashcraft requested findings and conclusions after this appeal was perfected\n\nfor the illegitimate purpose of raising new arguments to shore-up a teetering\n\njudgment. Ashcraft’s motion for entry of judgment gave no explanation for why\n\nthe clerk’s delay had not tolled the objection deadline. (CR:94.) As recounted in\n\nCopano’s objections,1 Ashcraft’s only argument had been that Copano’s receipt of\n\na hand-delivered paper copy was sufficiently similar to “certified or registered\n\nUnited States mail, return receipt requested” to prevent tolling. (CR:24.) After\n\njudgment was entered, Ashcraft apparently saw that its arguments cannot support\n\nits judgment. But proposing new findings and conclusions on equally unavailing\n\narguments about the effect of Copano’s electronic filing of the award cannot save\n\nthis judgment. (Id.)\n\n       The entire purpose of that exercise was illegitimate. Texas law has long\n\nrecognized that “an appellate court should not decide a case upon a theory different\n\nfrom that upon which it was pleaded and tried.” Am. Mut. Liability Ins. Co. v.\n\nParker, 144 Tex. 453, 460, 191 S.W.2d 844, 848 (Tex. 1945).\n1\n  The parties discussed the motion with the trial judge, but no evidentiary hearing was held, and\nno transcript was taken.\n\n\n                                               16\n\f      In sum, the findings and conclusions were improper and cannot support the\n\ntrial courts’ error of law in entering judgment and dismissing Copano’s appeal.\n\nThey must not be considered by this Court. IKB, 938 S.W.2d at 443; Black, 443\n\nS.W.3d at 166. The erroneous judgment must be reversed.\n\n                              CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      The trial court was led into error that denied Copano its right to appeal the\n\ncommissioners’ decision to the district court. Copano’s objections were timely\n\nfiled both as a matter of law and of sound public policy enacted by the Legislature.\n\n      Accordingly, Appellant, Copano NGL Services, LLC, respectfully prays that\n\nthe Honorable Court of Appeals reverse the judgment of the district court and\n\nremand for trial with Appellant receiving its costs at trial and on appeal, and all\n\nother relief it is entitled to receive consistent with the opinion of this Court.\n\n                                            Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                            LOCKE LORD LLP\n\n                                        By: /s/ Charles R. “Skip” Watson, Jr.\n                                           Charles R. “Skip” Watson, Jr.\n                                            State Bar No. 20967500\n                                            cwatson@lockelord.com\n                                           600 Congress Avenue, Suite 2200\n                                           Austin, Texas 78701\n                                           (512) 305-4700 (Telephone)\n                                           (512) 305-4800 (Facsimile)\n\n                                            Christopher Dove\n                                             State Bar No. 24032138\n                                             cdove@lockelord.com\n\n\n                                           17\n\f Ken McKay\n  State Bar No. 13690835\n  kmckay@lockelord.com\n A.

FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.     Plaintiff COPANO NGL SERVICES LLC (\"Copano\"), filed via a-file\n             its Petition for Condemnation on March 4, 2015.\n\f2.   An Order Appointing Special Commissioners was signed on\n     March 16, 2015.\n\n3.   An Order Striking Special Commissioner and Replacing With First\n     Alternate was signed on April 1, 2015.\n\n4.   On April 21, 2015, the Special Commissioners made an award to\n     Ashcraft of one million forty-three thousand eight hundred thirty\n     dollars ($1,043,830.00).\n\n5.   Copano offered to file the award of the Special Commissioners\n     with the district clerk.\n\n6.   Copano filed the Special Commissioners' Award with the district\n     clerk via e-file on April 21, 2015,\n\n7.   Copano received notice of its filing electronically on April 21,\n     2015, from the Matagorda County District Clerk.\n\n8.   Copano had notice of the filing of the Special Commissioners'\n     award on April 21, 2015.\n\n9.   The Matagorda County District Clerk sent notice of the decision\n     by the Special Commissioners to Copano and Ashcraft by e-mail\n     on April 21, 2015, and Copano and Ashcraft received such e-mail\n     notice on April 21, 2015.\n\n10. Copano filed its objection to the Special Commissioners' Award\n    on May 19, 2015.\n\n11. Ashcraft filed Defendants' Motion for Entry of Judgment on June\n    9, 2015, asserting that Defendants were entitled to judgment in\n    accordance with Section 21.049 of the Texas Property Code\n    because no timely objection was made to the findings of the\n    Special Commissioners by May 18, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                              2\n\fII. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n   1.   Section 21.018(a) of the Texas Property Code fixes the objections\n        deadline to the findings of the Special Commissioners as \"the first\n        Monday following the 20th day after the commissioners file their\n        findings with the court.\"\n\n   2,   The statutory deadline to file timely objections to the findings of\n        the Special Commissioners was May 18, 2015. See Tex. Prop.\n        Code Section 21.018.\n\n   3.   No party filed a timely objection to the findings of the Special\n        Commissioners.\n\n   4.   Copano admitted to notice of the filing of the Special\n        Commissioners' award with the Matagorda County District Clerk\n        and to knowledge of the statutory deadline to file objections to the\n        findings of the Special Commissioners.\n\n   5.   Copano did not timely file an objection to the findings of the\n        Special Commissioners by May 18, 2015, and intentionally waited\n        until after May 18, 2015, to file its objection, to see if Ashcraft\n        intended to object to the findings of the Special Commissioners.\n\n   6.   The timely filing of objections to the findings of the Special\n        Commissioners converts an \"administrative\" matter into a judicial\n        one. City of Tyler v. Beck, 196 S.W.3d 784, 786 (Tex. 2006).\n\n   7    Without timely objections to the findings of the Special\n        Commissioners, the trial court does not have jurisdiction to\n        entertain an \"appeal\" of the Special Commissioners' award and\n        must instead terminate the case by rendering judgment \"on the\n        award\" as a matter of ministerial duty. Pearson v. State, 315\n        S.W.2d 935, 938 (Tex. 1958).\n\n   8.   The Legislature has codified this principle in Property Code\n        Section 21.061: \"If no party in a condemnation proceeding files\n        timely objections to the findings of the special commissioners, the\n\n                                   3\n\f     judge of the court that has jurisdiction of the proceeding shall\n     adopt the commissioners' findings as the judgment of the court.\"\n     Tex. Prop. Code Section 21.061. (emphasis supplied)\n\n9.   Sections 21.018(a) and 21.061 of the Texas Property Code limit\n     the jurisdiction of the trial court when timely objections are not\n     filed.\n\n10. The Legislature has chosen not to create any statutory exceptions\n    to the operation of Sections 21.018(a) and 21.061.\n\n11. Texas Property Code Section 21.049 provides as follows:\n\n           Not later than the next working day after the day\n           the [Special Commissioners'] decision is filed,\n           the clerk shall send notice of the decision by\n           certified or registered United States mail, return\n           receipt requested, to the parties in the\n           proceeding, or to their attorneys of record, at\n           their addresses of record.\n\n12. The Legislature enacted Section 21.049 to ensure that\n    landowners received notice of the triggering event to file\n    objections to the findings of the Special Commissioners. See\n    John v. State, 826 S.W.2d 138, 140-41 (Tex. 1992).\n\n13. Section 21.049 is not designed to alter the operation of Sections\n    21.018 and 21.061, but instead to ensure that landowners know\n    when the period has started in order to object. See id.\n\n14. Given Section 21.049's limited purpose, the Supreme Court has\n    recognized only one circumstance in which Section 21.049 alters\n    the operation of the jurisdiction-limiting provisions in Sections\n    21.018 and 21.061.\n\n15. When landowners receive no notice of the filing of a Special\n    Commissioners' award, their objections deadline is tolled until the\n    court clerk sends notice. John, 826 S.W.2d at 140.\n\n                                4\n\f16. \"When a statute provides the method by which notice shall be\n    given in a particular instance, the notice provision must be\n    followed with reasonable strictness.\" John, 826 S.W.2d at 141 n.\n    4. (emphasis supplied)\n\n17. The notice of the award of the Special Commissioners provided\n    by the Matagorda County District Clerk by e-mail on April 21,\n    2015, followed Section 21.049 with reasonable strictness. See\n    Roccaforte v. Jefferson Cnty., 341 S.W.3d 919, 928-27 (Tex.\n    2011) (holding that hand-delivered notice satisfies a statute's\n    notice requirement even when the statute's plain language\n    requires notice by certified or registered mail); First Nat'l Bank in\n    Graham v. Sledge, 653 S.W.2d 283, 287 (Tex. 1983) (holding \"the\n    method of delivery is immaterial\" whenever \"notice is actually\n    received\"); Schepps v. Presbyterian Hosp. of Dallas, 652 S.W.2d\n    934, 936 (Tex. 1983) (Provisions [of a notice statute] which are\n    not of the essence of the thing to be done, but which are included\n    for the purpose of promoting the proper, orderly and prompt\n    conduct of business, are not generally regarded as mandatory.\").\n\n18. A notice statute calling for delivery by registered or certified mail\n    can be satisfied by an alternative method of service. Washington\n    v, Related Arbor Court, LLC, 357 S.W.3d 676, 681 (Tex.\n    App.—Houston [14\"' Dist.] 2011, no pet.) (\"[S]tatutory notice\n    requirements may be satisfied by a method of service other than\n    the prescribed statutory method when the recipient acknowledges\n    receipt and therefore has the actual notice the statutory\n    requirement is intended to guarantee.\"); Goforth v. Bradshaw, 296\n    S.W.3d 849, 851 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2009, no pet.) (expert\n    reports sent by regular mail within statutory deadline, which\n    defendants acknowledged receiving, were timely served even\n    though statute required the documents to be served through\n    registered or certified mail); Spiegel v. Strother, 262 S.W.3d 481,\n    486 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2008, no pet.) (holding the same when\n    plaintiff sent an expert report by priority mail rather than registered\n    or certified mall and the expert acknowledged timely receipt of the\n    mailing); Wesco Distrib., Inc. v. Westport Grp., Inc., 150 S.W.3d\n    553, 559 (Tex. App.—Austin 2004, no pet.) (holding that even\n\n                                 5\n\n\n\n\n                                21\n\f             when a notice requirement \"plays a critical role In achieving the\n             purposes of (a) statute,\" \"technical defects\" In method of service\n             are \"excused by substantial compliance\"); Netherland v. Wittner,\n             862 S.W,2d 786, 787 (Tex. App.—Houston (14\" Dist.] 1983, writ\n             ref'd n.r.e.) (holding proper notice was delivered despite\n             registered-mall requirement when appellant admitted actual notice\n             of trial setting by phone call and unregistered mall); Hill v. W.E.\n             §rittaln. (not, 408 S.W.2d 803, 807 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth\n             1988, no writ) (holding variance in method of service was\n             immaterial because service actually occurred).\n        19.

The reason\nfindings and conclusions “have no place” in a summary                 [3] The purpose of Rule 296 is to give a party a right to\njudgment proceeding is that for summary judgment to be               findings of fact and conclusions of law finally adjudicated\nrendered, there cannot be a “genuine issue as to any material        after a conventional trial on the merits before the court.

First, the original notice provision was an attempt to      trial court may require as to proof of compliance. Had it not\nprovide for resolution of malpractice claims without the filing      been the intent of the Legislature that the notice provision\nof suit. Senator Kent Hance of Lubbock County, in explaining         was mandatory, there would have been no need for the\nhis amendment that deleted the intent language from the              incorporation of paragraph (b) into the section. Accordingly,\nnotice section, noted that the bill “merely states that you          we conclude that the courts below were correct in construing\nwould have to give notice to anyone before you file a lawsuit        the language of section 4.01 as being mandatory, and notice\nagainst them.” Transcription, Senate proceedings, H.B. 1048,         must be given at least sixty days before suit is filed.\nApril 18, 1977. Second, the feature of the legislative proposal\nthat might have best accomplished a resolution of malpractice        In addition to the court of appeals in this cause, three other\nclaims was eliminated from the bill—the screening panel              courts have written in an effort to interpret section 4.01 of\nprovision. We must conclude, therefore, that the Legislature         article 4590i. Wilborn v.

That important issue arose in\n\nthe following context:\n\n                            STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n      A pipeline constructed by Copano required land held by Appellee John\n\nAshcraft, individually and as trustee of the John Ashcraft Family Trust 2012.\n\n(CR:4.) Copano’s petition to condemn the land was assigned to the 23rd District\n\nCourt of Matagorda County, Texas, the Honorable Ben Hardin presiding.\n\n      On April 21, 2015, the special commissioners’ award was filed with the trial\n\ncourt, but it took until May 27 for the clerk to mail the notice in the manner\n\nrequired by TEXAS PROPERTY CODE § 21.049.           (CR:29, 93.)    Copano timely\n\nobjected to the award on May 19. (CR:91.) But, Ashcraft moved for entry of\n\njudgment on the award, arguing that the May 19 objections were untimely and the\n\ntrial court must adopt the Special Commissioners’ award as its judgment. (CR:94.)\n\n      The trial court entered judgment on the award (CR:151), necessitating this\n\nappeal. (CR:205.)\n\f                     STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n      Copano believes the mistaken statutory construction that resulted in the\n\ndenial of jurisdiction over an administrative award for property taken by\n\ncondemnation merits full discussion of the issues and opportunity to address this\n\ncourt’s questions.\n\n                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n      The Supreme Court has consistently held that the Legislature enacted\n\nSection 21.049 of the Texas Property Code to toll the time prescribed by Section\n\n21.018 for parties to file objections that trigger a district court’s jurisdiction over\n\nan appeal from a special commissioners’ decision in a condemnation. It has also\n\nheld that Section 21.049’s specific requirement (that “[n]ot later than the next\n\nworking day after the [commissioners’] decision is filed, the clerk shall send notice\n\nof the decision by certified or registered United States mail … to the parties in the\n\nproceeding, or to their attorneys of record”) is “mandatory” and must be strictly\n\ncomplied with before the time for objections can begin to run. The provision must\n\nbe interpreted to promote, rather than limit, the parties’ right to appeal.\n\n      1.     Did the district court err in entering judgment on the special\n             commissioners’ award, and dismissing Copano’s appeal, even\n             though Copano’s objections to the award were filed prior to 20\n             days after the clerk gave the requisite notice by certified mail?\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f      2.     Can filing findings of fact and conclusions of law in the absence\n             of an evidentiary hearing, disputed facts, or evidence, alter an\n             error of law in dismissing an appeal from a commissioners’\n             award for want of jurisdiction, and entering judgment on the\n             award instead?\n\n                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      This appeal presents a pure question of law: whether Copano timely filed its\n\nobjections to the special commissioners’ award. The facts forming the context for\n\nthis legal question are straightforward.\n\n      The Copano Sweeny NGL Pipeline will transport natural gas liquids twenty-\n\nthree miles from the Eagle Ford Shale to purchasers and processors in Sweeny,\n\nTexas. (CR:5-6.) Copano will own and operate the pipeline. (Id.) The pipeline\n\nrequired a narrow easement across Ashcraft’s property that totaled about eight\n\nacres. (CR:7-9, 16.)\n\n      Copano and Ashcraft disagreed about the easement’s value, so Copano\n\nexercised its power of eminent domain by filing a petition for condemnation under\n\nTEXAS PROPERTY CODE § 21.012. (CR:5.) The district court appointed special\n\ncommissioners to value the easement as required by Tex. Prop. Code § 21.014.\n\n(CR:24.) On April 21, 2015, the special commissioners issued their award of well\n\nover a million dollars for the eight acre easement. (CR:31.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f        The Texas Property Code sets forth what must happen next. Section 21.049\n\nrequires two things. First, the judge hearing the case must inform the clerk of the\n\nspecial commissioners’ decision within one working day after the decision is filed.\n\nSecond, the clerk must immediately mail notice of the award to the parties by\n\ncertified or registered United States mail, return receipt requested:\n\n        Not later than the next working day after the day the decision is filed,\n        the clerk shall send notice of the decision by certified or registered\n        United States mail, return receipt requested, to the parties in the\n        proceeding, or to their attorneys of record, at their addresses of record.\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE § 21.049. Here, the clerk’s office failed to discharge that duty.\n\n        The duties are important because a party may appeal from the\n\ncommissioners’ findings by filing a statement of its objections under Texas\n\nProperty Code § 21.018.\n\n        On the day the special commissioners issued their award, April 21, 2015,\n\nCopano electronically filed the award with the district clerk. (CR:29.) Copano\n\nspecifically reminded the clerk of its duty to mail notice in the manner required by\n\nTexas Property Code § 21.049:\n\n\n\n\n(Id.)\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f      But the clerk’s office did not mail the award until May 27, 2015, more than a\n\nmonth later. (CR:93.)\n\n      Copano filed its objections early – on May 19, 2015. (CR:91.) Thus, the\n\ntrial court should have proceeded to “try the case in the same manner as other civil\n\ncauses,” as required by Section 21.018(b).\n\n      But, notwithstanding Section 21.049 Ashcraft filed a Motion for Entry of\n\nJudgment claiming that the deadline for objections was actually May 18 under\n\nSection 21.018. (CR:94.) Ashcraft asserted that the district court had to “adopt the\n\ncommissioners’ findings as the judgment of the court” (Id.; see TEX. PROP. CODE\n\n§ 21.061.) The motion for judgment dealt with the clerk’s delay, which tolled the\n\ndeadine for objections, by ignoring it. (CR:94.)\n\n      Copano’s response pointed out that the Supreme Court held that a clerk’s\n\ndelay in mailing the notice tolls the deadline for objections, and that even actual\n\nnotice of the award provides no exception to this mandatory tolling rule.\n\n(CR:118.)    Nevertheless, the trial court entered judgment on the special\n\ncommissioners’ award. (CR:151.) Copano timely appealed. (CR:205.)\n\n      After Copano appealed to this Court, Ashcraft raised new and untested\n\narguments about the effect of Copano’s electronic filing of the special\n\ncommissioners’ award by proposing findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n(SCR:4-12.) Copano objected to the request because findings and conclusions may\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fnot be entered in cases where no evidentiary hearing was held, and because\n\nAshcraft sought to inject new legal theories after judgment was entered. (SCR:23.)\n\n      The trial court did not hold an evidentiary hearing on Ashcraft’s Motion for\n\nEntry of Judgment, nor did Ashcraft proffer evidence in support of its motion\n\n(CR:94), no doubt because the only material relevant “facts” are undisputed and\n\nministerial – the date when the special commissioners’ award was filed, the date\n\nwhen the clerk mailed that award to the parties, and the date Copano filed its\n\nobjections. (SCR:9.) But the trial court signed the findings and conclusions\n\nproposed by Ashcraft, without changing a word. (SCR:17.)\n\n                             SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      The trial court denied Copano’s statutory right of a trial de novo to appeal\n\nthe special commissioners’ condemnation award. That error was based on the trial\n\ncourt’s failure:\n\n      (i)    to follow Supreme Court precedent tolling the due date for\n             filing jurisdiction-triggering objections to the award (that has\n             guided litigants since 1992); and\n\n      (ii)   to understand that the Legislature enacts statutes containing\n             mandatory provisions that set forth the precise type of notice\n             that must be given to trigger district courts’ jurisdiction over\n             condemnation awards and the critical difference between their\n             mandatory notice requirements and:\n\n                   − actual notice; or\n\n                   − notice of an e-filing.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      Instead, the trial court wrongly determined that the Legislature’s mandatory,\n\nparty-neutral requirement that the clerks send notice by certified mail was enacted\n\nsolely to benefit landowners.\n\n      That series of errors has denied Copano access to the courts and due process\n\nguaranteed by our Constitution and statutes, as consistently interpreted by our\n\nSupreme Court. It requires swift reversal.\n\n                             BRIEF OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n      Jurisdiction over a judicial review of an administrative determination –\n\nespecially when it involves taking of and compensation for property – cannot be\n\ntaken lightly. Here, the district court interpreted the Supreme Court’s construction\n\nof a jurisdiction-tolling statute that was enacted to encourage appeals, to achieve\n\nthe opposite result. It refused jurisdiction that the Legislature enacted a statute to\n\nensure.\n\nI.    Copano’s Objections Were Timely Filed, Invoking the District Court’s\n      Jurisdiction.\n\n      A.     The statutes that frame jurisdiction tolled the time for filing\n             objections.\n\n      The trial court’s jurisdiction over a commissioners’ award is governed by the\n\nfollowing.\n\n      First, Section 21.049 requires two actions immediately upon the trial court’s\n\nreceipt of the commissioners’ report containing their decision:\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      (i)    “The judge of a court hearing a proceeding under this chapter\n             shall inform the clerk of the court as to a decision by the special\n             commissioners on the day the decision is filed or on the next\n             working date after the day the decision is filed.”\n\n      (ii)   “Not later than the next working day after the day the decision\n             is filed, the clerk shall send notice of the decision by certified\n             or registered United States mail, return receipt requested, to the\n             parties in the proceeding, or to their attorneys of record, at their\n             addresses of record.”\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE § 21.049 (emphasis added).\n\n      Second, a party’s written statement of its objections to the award “must be\n\nfiled on or before the first Monday following the 20th day after the day the\n\ncommissioners’ file their findings with the court.” TEX. PROP. CODE § 21.018(a).\n\nTimely notice by the clerk of the commissioners’ decision in the form prescribed\n\nby the Legislature is therefore critical because the trial court must enter “the\n\ncommissioners’ findings as the judgment of the court” unless the parties timely\n\nobject to the commissioners’ report. TEX. PROP. CODE § 21.061.\n\n      The question of law that the district court got wrong is whether the clerk’s\n\nfailure to comply with Section 21.049’s precise requirement of notice by certified\n\nmailing tolls the deadline in Section 21.018. The Supreme Court definitively has\n\nanswered that question.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      B.     The deadline for making jurisdiction-triggering objections to the\n             commissioner’s award does not begin until the clerk complies\n             with Section 21.049.\n\n      The Supreme Court has repeatedly answered the question by holding that the\n\nnotice required by the Legislature in Section 21.049 is “mandatory.” John v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2451930\"><a href=\"/opinion/2451930/john-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140 & n.3 (Tex. 1992). That means the “time to object” to the\n\nspecial commissioners’ award “is tolled until the clerk sends the required notice\n\npursuant to section 21.049.” Id. at 141 (emphasis added).\n\n      The requirement is mandatory for jurisdiction over appeals by all parties,\n\neven though John spoke in terms of tolling the time for the landowner’s objections.\n\nThe Court subsequently made it clear that the “time for making objections” that\n\ntrigger the trial court’s jurisdiction is tolled “if the parties are not given proper\n\nnotice” as required by Section 21.049.

The Supreme Court has never varied from\n\nconstruing Section 21.049’s clerk’s notice by certified mail requirement as tolling\n\nthe time allotted by the more general statute, Section 21.018, until the clerk sends\n\n“proper” notice in the form prescribed by the Legislature.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f      C.     Courts cannot vary the form of notice mandated by the\n             Legislature for triggering the district court’s jurisdiction.\n\n             1.    Actual notice will not suffice.\n\n      Courts are bound by the Legislature’s requirement. Thus, not even actual\n\nnotice by a clerk personally handing a party’s attorney “a file-stamped copy of the\n\nnotice” of the commissioners’ decision will be allowed to substitute for Section\n\n21.049’s requirement that the clerk give notice by certified mail. Oncor Elec.\n\nDelivery Co. v. Schunke, No. 04-13-00067-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6672494</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio Dec. 18, 2013, pet. dism’d).\n\n      A mandatory notice statute means that it must be strictly applied. See\n\nSchepps v. Presbyterian Hosp. of Dallas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1772364\"><a href=\"/opinion/1772364/schepps-v-presbyterian-hosp-of-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 936-38 (Tex. 1983). By\n\ncontrast, when a statute’s notice requirement can be satisfied by actual notice, it\n\nsays so. See, e.g., First Nat’l Bank in Graham v. Sledge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1799806\"><a href=\"/opinion/1799806/first-nat-bank-in-graham-v-sledge/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287\n\n(Tex. 1983). Thus, actual knowledge of an award by an attorney filing it and\n\nreceiving a file-stamped copy from the clerk will not satisfy the clerk’s duty to\n\ngive “proper” statutory notice by mailing the notice of decision as required by\n\nSection 21.049. Oncor at *3-4.\n\n      Equally important, in Oncor the court also recognized that parties are\n\n“entitled to rely on the rule articulated in John” in calculating the time for filing\n\ntheir objections to the award. Id. at *4. That has been the law since John was\n\ndecided in 1992, and that is what Copano did here.\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             2.     E-filing will not suffice.\n\n      After this appeal was filed, Ashcraft sought to raise an equally unavailing\n\ntheory by going beyond the record for findings and conclusions regarding notice\n\nby e-filing. But if being handed a file-stamped copy of the award does not satisfy\n\nthe clerk’s “mandatory” duty to immediately give notice by certified mail, an\n\nelectronic notice of filing will hardly suffice for proper compliance. Thus, the trial\n\ncourt’s belated finding of notice by e-filing cannot save the judgment for three\n\nindependent reasons.\n\n      First, the clerk’s office, having been specifically cautioned of its duty to\n\nmail the award to the parties, performed that duty on May 27, 2015, indicating that\n\nthe clerk’s office knew that its duty had to be performed via the U.S. mail.\n\n      Second, there is no evidence that the commissioners’ decision containing\n\ntheir award was “e-mailed” to Copano’s counsel on April 21, or any other day.\n\n(Copano believes that a hearing would have established that the clerk has no record\n\nof emailing notice.)\n\n      And if “emailing” is referring to e-filing the award, there is again no\n\nevidence when or even if the file-marked award was electronically sent to\n\nCopano’s counsel. Instead, the argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding\n\nof the process, which, again, is not in the record:\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      Within minutes of e-filing the award, a “filing-submitted” reply transmits the\n\nfact of filing, but not a copy of what was filed. Thus, a file-stamp on a document\n\nsubsequently accepted for filing does not mean the document was actually\n\nreturned that day.    The same procedure applies to a later “filing accepted”\n\nelectronic reply, though it supplies a link to a file-stamped copy on the\n\neFile.Texas.gov server.\n\n      Neither is of record, though Copano believes the trial court’s electronic\n\ndocket would show the “e-filing” was not “accepted” until May 1. That means that\n\neven if access to a link showed for the first time on May 1, that Copano’s filing\n\nwas “accepted” the availability of a link cannot substitute for the mandatory\n\nstatutory requirement of certified mail. But even if a “filing accepted” notice could\n\nbe substituted for the Legislature’s mandatory certified mail notice provision\n\n(which it cannot), Copano’s May 19 filing would be timely even under Ashcraft’s\n\nbelated theory.\n\n      Third, courts cannot by rule negate or alter statutory requirements enacted\n\nby the Legislature. The Supreme Court always recognizes that its rule-making\n\npower is limited to establishing rules and procedures “not inconsistent with the law\n\nof the State” by former Art. V, Sec. 25 of the Texas Constitution. Thus, “when a\n\nrule of the court conflicts with a legislative enactment, the rule must yield.” Few v.\n\nCharter Oak Fire Ins.

That argument for denying jurisdiction over Copano’s appeal\n\nflounders in two fundamental ways.\n\n      First, the goal of liberal construction is to ensure that “the right of appeal\n\nshould not be lost due to procedural technicalities.”       Roccaforte v.

The goals of the Legislature and the Court are the same –\n\nreaching the merits of a party’s appeal of a condemnation award.\n\n      To sum up, Ashcraft is asking this Court to make law by ignoring Supreme\n\nCourt holdings that the deadline for filing objections is tolled until the clerk\n\ncomplies with the mandatory provisions of Section 21.049 by giving notice by\n\ncertified mail. Here as in Oncor the parties had every right to rely on both the\n\nLegislature’s mandatory provision and Supreme Court precedent construing it.\n\nThe district court erred in entering judgment on the commissioners’ findings. It\n\nmust be reversed so Copano can have its day in court.\n\nII.   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Are Not Only Immaterial,\n      They Are Erroneous.\n\n      Rather than supporting Ashcraft’s judgment, the trial court’s immaterial and\n\nerroneous findings of fact and conclusions of law reveal instead that when\n\njurisdiction is decided as a pure question of law, findings and conclusions cannot\n\nbe made in the absence of evidentiary hearings, let alone absent evidence of\n\ndisputed facts. They create a false illusion of resolving facts when none were\n\nheard or needed to be decided.\n\n      Thus, where the trial court renders judgment without an evidentiary hearing,\n\n“findings and conclusions have no purpose and should not be requested, made, or\n\nconsidered on appeal.” IKB Indus.

Ashcraft’s motion for entry of judgment gave no explanation for why\n\nthe clerk’s delay had not tolled the objection deadline. (CR:94.) As recounted in\n\nCopano’s objections,1 Ashcraft’s only argument had been that Copano’s receipt of\n\na hand-delivered paper copy was sufficiently similar to “certified or registered\n\nUnited States mail, return receipt requested” to prevent tolling. (CR:24.) After\n\njudgment was entered, Ashcraft apparently saw that its arguments cannot support\n\nits judgment.

S         23\" JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n\n\n            FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n\n      On June 24, 2015, this Court signed a final judgment in favor of\n\nDefendants John Ashcraft, Individually and as Trustee for the John Ashcraft\n\nFamily Trust 2012 (\"Ashcraft\"). Ashcraft requested that this Court make\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law on July 9, 2015. The final judgment\n\nrendered by this Court on June 24, 2015, was made in accordance with\n\nSection 21.061 of the Texas Property Code, following a hearing conducted on\n\nJune 15, 2015. The findings of fact made by this Court are based on\n\nstipulations of the parties at the June 15, 2015, hearing conducted in this\n\ncase and this Court's judicial notice of the district clerk's file in this matter.\n\nI.    FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      1.     Plaintiff COPANO NGL SERVICES LLC (\"Copano\"), filed via a-file\n             its Petition for Condemnation on March 4, 2015.\n\f2.   An Order Appointing Special Commissioners was signed on\n     March 16, 2015.\n\n3.   An Order Striking Special Commissioner and Replacing With First\n     Alternate was signed on April 1, 2015.\n\n4.   On April 21, 2015, the Special Commissioners made an award to\n     Ashcraft of one million forty-three thousand eight hundred thirty\n     dollars ($1,043,830.00).\n\n5.   Copano offered to file the award of the Special Commissioners\n     with the district clerk.\n\n6.   Copano filed the Special Commissioners' Award with the district\n     clerk via e-file on April 21, 2015,\n\n7.   Copano received notice of its filing electronically on April 21,\n     2015, from the Matagorda County District Clerk.\n\n8.   Copano had notice of the filing of the Special Commissioners'\n     award on April 21, 2015.\n\n9.   The Matagorda County District Clerk sent notice of the decision\n     by the Special Commissioners to Copano and Ashcraft by e-mail\n     on April 21, 2015, and Copano and Ashcraft received such e-mail\n     notice on April 21, 2015.\n\n10. Copano filed its objection to the Special Commissioners' Award\n    on May 19, 2015.\n\n11. Ashcraft filed Defendants' Motion for Entry of Judgment on June\n    9, 2015, asserting that Defendants were entitled to judgment in\n    accordance with Section 21.049 of the Texas Property Code\n    because no timely objection was made to the findings of the\n    Special Commissioners by May 18, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n                              2\n\fII. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n   1.   Section 21.018(a) of the Texas Property Code fixes the objections\n        deadline to the findings of the Special Commissioners as \"the first\n        Monday following the 20th day after the commissioners file their\n        findings with the court.\"\n\n   2,   The statutory deadline to file timely objections to the findings of\n        the Special Commissioners was May 18, 2015. See Tex. Prop.\n        Code Section 21.018.\n\n   3.   No party filed a timely objection to the findings of the Special\n        Commissioners.\n\n   4.   Copano admitted to notice of the filing of the Special\n        Commissioners' award with the Matagorda County District Clerk\n        and to knowledge of the statutory deadline to file objections to the\n        findings of the Special Commissioners.\n\n   5.   Copano did not timely file an objection to the findings of the\n        Special Commissioners by May 18, 2015, and intentionally waited\n        until after May 18, 2015, to file its objection, to see if Ashcraft\n        intended to object to the findings of the Special Commissioners.\n\n   6.   The timely filing of objections to the findings of the Special\n        Commissioners converts an \"administrative\" matter into a judicial\n        one. City of Tyler v. Beck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894769\"><a href=\"/opinion/894769/city-of-tyler-v-beck/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 786 (Tex. 2006).\n\n   7    Without timely objections to the findings of the Special\n        Commissioners, the trial court does not have jurisdiction to\n        entertain an \"appeal\" of the Special Commissioners' award and\n        must instead terminate the case by rendering judgment \"on the\n        award\" as a matter of ministerial duty. Pearson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1783546\"><a href=\"/opinion/1783546/pearson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span>\n        <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 938 (Tex. 1958).\n\n   8.   The Legislature has codified this principle in Property Code\n        Section 21.061: \"If no party in a condemnation proceeding files\n        timely objections to the findings of the special commissioners, the\n\n                                   3\n\f     judge of the court that has jurisdiction of the proceeding shall\n     adopt the commissioners' findings as the judgment of the court.\"\n     Tex. Prop. Code Section 21.061. (emphasis supplied)\n\n9.   Sections 21.018(a) and 21.061 of the Texas Property Code limit\n     the jurisdiction of the trial court when timely objections are not\n     filed.\n\n10. The Legislature has chosen not to create any statutory exceptions\n    to the operation of Sections 21.018(a) and 21.061.\n\n11. Texas Property Code Section 21.049 provides as follows:\n\n           Not later than the next working day after the day\n           the [Special Commissioners'] decision is filed,\n           the clerk shall send notice of the decision by\n           certified or registered United States mail, return\n           receipt requested, to the parties in the\n           proceeding, or to their attorneys of record, at\n           their addresses of record.\n\n12. The Legislature enacted Section 21.049 to ensure that\n    landowners received notice of the triggering event to file\n    objections to the findings of the Special Commissioners. See\n    John v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2451930\"><a href=\"/opinion/2451930/john-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140-41 (Tex. 1992).\n\n13. Section 21.049 is not designed to alter the operation of Sections\n    21.018 and 21.061, but instead to ensure that landowners know\n    when the period has started in order to object. See id.\n\n14. Given Section 21.049's limited purpose, the Supreme Court has\n    recognized only one circumstance in which Section 21.049 alters\n    the operation of the jurisdiction-limiting provisions in Sections\n    21.018 and 21.061.\n\n15. When landowners receive no notice of the filing of a Special\n    Commissioners' award, their objections deadline is tolled until the\n    court clerk sends notice. John, 826 S.W.2d at 140.\n\n                                4\n\f16. \"When a statute provides the method by which notice shall be\n    given in a particular instance, the notice provision must be\n    followed with reasonable strictness.\" John, 826 S.W.2d at 141 n.\n    4. (emphasis supplied)\n\n17. The notice of the award of the Special Commissioners provided\n    by the Matagorda County District Clerk by e-mail on April 21,\n    2015, followed Section 21.049 with reasonable strictness.
