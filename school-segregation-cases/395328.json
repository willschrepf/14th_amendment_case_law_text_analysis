(No. 95-8356-CV-KLR),\nKenneth L. Ryskamp, Judge.\n\nBefore TJOFLAT, BARKETT and MARCUS, Circuit Judges.\n\n        MARCUS, Circuit Judge:\n\n        Appellants, three African-American tenants of the Okeechobee Center, a housing project located in\n\nunincorporated Palm Beach County, and four African-American residents of the City of Belle Glade, brought\n\nthis lawsuit alleging that the City of Belle Glade unlawfully deprived them of their right to vote in failing to\n\nannex the Okeechobee Center into the City. Specifically, Appellants contend that the City failed to annex the\n\nhousing project for racial reasons in violation of the First, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments\n\nto the United States Constitution, section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964 and its implementing regulations. After extensive pre-trial proceedings, the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Appellees, the City of Belle Glade and others, on all counts, finding neither\n\na constitutional nor a statutory violation.\n\n        On appeal, Appellants challenge the district court's order on three basic grounds: first, the district\n\ncourt purportedly erred in concluding that Appellants failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nAppellees' discriminatory intent; second, the district court also erred in holding that the remedies they\n\nsought—including the unusual remedy of ordering a city to annex property into its municipal\n\nboundaries—were neither available under the Voting Rights Act nor permissible under the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure; and finally, the district court erred in granting summary judgment sua sponte to Appellees\n\fon Appellants' Title VI claims. After thoroughly reviewing the record and the parties' briefs, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgment concerning Appellants' constitutional and Voting Rights Act claims, as well as the\n\nTitle VI statutory claim, but reverse and remand Appellants' cause of action to enforce Title VI's disparate\n\nimpact regulations for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      I.\n\n        The historical facts and the procedural history necessary to understand this lawsuit are complex and\n\nextensive. At the core, however, this legal battle has been fought over the refusal of the City of Belle Glade\n\n(\"City\") to annex an adjacent housing project known as the Okeechobee Center Farmers' Home\n\nAdministration Project (\"Okeechobee Center\") into its geographic and municipal boundaries.\n\n        The City of Belle Glade is an incorporated municipality located on the western side of Palm Beach\n\nCounty, near Florida's agricultural heartland. In the 1930s, the federal government created two housing\n\nprojects outside the city limits. One of them, known as the Osceola Center, was populated by whites and\n\nstood at the City's northwest corner. The other, the Okeechobee Center, was populated by blacks and was\n\nlocated to the southwest of the City. In 1947, the City created the Belle Glade Housing Authority (\"BGHA\"),\n\na board of seven members nominated by the mayor and appointed by the City Commission, to address the\n\n\"shortage of safe sanitary dwelling accommodations in the City of Belle Glade available to persons of low\n\nincome at rentals they can afford.\" The BGHA assumed ownership and operation of both the Osceola and\n\nOkeechobee Centers. The centers, however, remain funded in part by the federal government through grants\n\nfrom the Department of Agriculture. \"Jim Crow\" laws required both housing projects to be segregated by\n\nrace.1 During this time, the City also mandated residential segregation. See, e.g., Belle Glade, Fla.,\n\n\n\n   1\n     In March 1975, however, a group of tenants brought suit in federal district court against the Secretary\nof Agriculture and various local housing authorities under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to\nintegrate the centers. See Mae Golden Acres Tenants' Ass'n v. Butz, No. 75-1161-CIV-JE (S.D.Fla.1975).\nOn July 19, 1977, the district court entered a stipulation for consent judgment in the Mae Golden Acres\nlitigation, which provided that the BGHA would no longer segregate the Osceola and Okeechobee\nCenters by race and would administer the projects according to racially non-discriminatory policies. This\nsettlement marked the formal end of de jure segregation at the Osceola and Okeechobee Centers.\n\n                                                      2\n\fOrdinance 45, 184, 273, 443 (Nov. 18, 1931, Sept. 18, 1936, January 12, 1938, December 27, 1939). These\n\nordinances were repealed, however, by 1963. See Belle Glade, Fla., Ordinance 63-11, § 1 (April 24, 1963)\n\n(repealing Belle Glade, Fla., Code §§ 26-14 to -17 (relating to zoning)).\n\n        In 1960, the total population of the City of Belle Glade was 11,273, of which 7,393 (65.6%) were\n\nnon-whites and 3,880 (34.4%) were whites.2 The following year, the City proposed, for the first time,\n\nextending its municipal boundaries by annexing both the Okeechobee and Osceola Centers. The City asked\n\nthe property owner, BGHA, whether it had any views on the matter. After discussing the possible advantages\n\nand disadvantages, the BGHA ultimately petitioned to the City only for annexation of the Osceola Center.\n\nSoon thereafter, on April 26, 1961, the City Commission considered the BGHA's petition and unanimously\n\nannexed the Osceola Center.\n\n        In the 1970s, the City and the BGHA twice considered the possibility of annexing the Okeechobee\n\nCenter. In 1971, the City Commission's minutes simply reflect that a meeting was to be arranged between\n\nthe City Commission and the BGHA to discuss the possibility of annexing the Okeechobee Center. The\n\nminutes make no mention, however, of who made the annexation request or whether any meeting was ever\n\nheld. Two years later, on February 26, 1973, a group of tenants from the Okeechobee Center asked the City\n\nCommission to annex the center. The City Commission advised the tenants that it would consider annexation\n\nif the BGHA made the request. On April 17, 1973, the tenants asked the BGHA to petition the City for\n\nannexation, but the BGHA denied their request in October 1973. The record does not reflect whether the\n\nBGHA offered any reason for denying the request.\n\n\n\n\n   2\n     As of 1970, the total population of Belle Glade increased to 15,949, of which the percentage of blacks\ndecreased to 52.9% while the percentage of whites increased to 46.5%. By 1993, a special census showed\nthat the City's total population had increased further to 17,208, the population of blacks increasing to\n54.8% and the white population decreasing to 39.6%. As of May 24, 1994, the population of the Osceola\nCenter was 46% black, 50% Hispanic, and 4% white, whereas the population of the Okeechobee Center\nwas 92% black and 8% Hispanic.\n\n                                                     3\n\f        The following year, the Florida legislature repealed all local laws pertaining to the adjustment of\n\nmunicipal boundaries and established a uniform legislative standard for use throughout the state. See\n\nMunicipal Annexation or Contraction Act, 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat.\n\nAnn. §§ 171.021-.022 (West 1987)). The statute specifically provided for the voluntary annexation of any\n\nproperty contiguous to a municipality upon petition by the property owner to the municipality's governing\n\nbody. See 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West\n\nSupp.1998)). The City Commission also could initiate annexation of any contiguous, compact, and\n\nunincorporated property by a referendum of the registered voters of the municipality and the residents of the\n\narea proposed to be annexed. See 1975 Fla. Laws ch. 75-297, § 2 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. §\n\n171.0413 (West.1987 & Supp.1998)). Notably, according to these provisions, the statute prohibited\n\nmunicipalities from annexing any property that did not meet the statute's definition of contiguity. See 1974\n\nFla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.031(11) (West 1987)).3\n\n        Two attempts to secure the City's annexation of the Okeechobee Center through litigation occurred\n\nin 1980.4 Pursuant to a settlement agreement, the City and City Commission agreed to appoint an\n\n\"Annexation Committee\" to investigate and make recommendations concerning the wisdom and efficacy of\n\nannexing the Okeechobee Center.5 In November 1984, after the Committee held public hearings, received\n\n\n\n\n   3\n     The parties dispute whether the Okeechobee Center is contiguous to the City, and, hence, available\nfor annexation under Florida law. See discussion infra Part II.B.2.\n   4\n     In Okeechobee Center Cries for Help v. Belle Glade Housing Authority, No. 80-8220-CIV-JAG\n(S.D.Fla.1980), tenants of the Okeechobee Center sued the City and the BGHA seeking, inter alia, a\nmandatory injunction requiring the defendants to take all steps necessary to annex the Okeechobee Center\ninto Belle Glade. Similarly, in Jackson v. City of Belle Glade, 95 F.R.D. 384 (S.D.Fla.1982), some Belle\nGlade residents brought suit against the City and BGHA, seeking annexation of all black areas adjacent to\nthe City The parties eventually resolved both lawsuits prior to trial without the plaintiffs' obtaining\nannexation and, in March 1984, the court dismissed the suits with prejudice.\n   5\n    The City Commission appointed five members to this Committee: one member of the Okeechobee\nCenter Tenant's Association, one black resident of the City as recommended by the Panhellenic Council,\nand three additional members, at least one of whom had to be a member of a minority group.\n\n                                                     4\n\fcomments from the public, investigated and considered the possibilities and ramifications of annexation, and\n\nconducted a cost study of annexation, the Committee issued a report recommending against annexation on\n\nthe grounds that the Okeechobee Center did not satisfy Florida's statutory contiguity requirement and that\n\nannexation did not make reasonable economic sense for the City.6 However, the report also urged the City\n\nCommission to consider other factors \"relating to the humanitarian aspects of those residing in Okeechobee\n\nCenter\" in light of residents' feelings \"that annexation would right past 'wrongs.' \" On January 28, 1985, the\n\nCity Commission officially accepted the Annexation Committee's report.\n\n        As far as the record reflects, the tenants' efforts at annexing the Okeechobee Center lay dormant for\n\nover ten years, until May 8, 1995, when Albert Peterson, a resident of the Okeechobee Center and President\n\nof the Resident's Council of the Okeechobee and Osceola Centers, wrote Mayor Weeks requesting that the\n\nCity annex the Okeechobee Center. On May 30, 1995, the Mayor denied Peterson's request, concluding that\n\nannexation would be \"neither feasible nor advantageous to the City from the financial and public services\n\nperspective.\" The Mayor's letter summarized the findings of \"[a] study of this issue that was done a number\n\nof years ago\":\n\n                Upon annexation, the City must provide the following municipal services: water, sewer,\n        police protection, sanitation services, street lighting, street signs, street paving, maintenance,\n        drainage, parks and recreation. Since the subject land is exempt from ad valorem taxes, no property\n        taxes would be generated to offset the cost of providing the necessary services, which far outweigh\n        any miscellaneous revenues that might be realized.\n\n               Other factors in determining the viability of annexing the parcel included the following: 1)\n        No need exists to expand into the proposed parcel, 2) No industry would be annexed, 3) The parcel\n        would provide no additional facilities to be brought into the City, 4) Annexation would not improve\n        the economy of the City, and 5) The Comprehensive Plan would have to be revised thereby\n        compounding the expense to the City.\n\n\n\n\n   6\n    Specifically, the report estimated the following capital outlay and first year start-up costs: library\nservices, $158,693; inspection, $8,000; fire, $442,000; streets $7,140; building and grounds, $18,640;\ngarbage collection, $138,483; police, $133,724; and parks and recreation, $119, 556. Thus, the total\nestimated costs were $1,026,236. The report further estimated that the property would generate\nmiscellaneous revenues for the City of $126,000 per year.\n\n                                                      5\n\f               City Attorney John Baker's legal opinion was that the City may not annex the property\n        known as the Okeechobee Center because the said property is not contiguous to the municipal\n        boundaries, and annexation is therefore prohibited by Florida statutes.\n\nBecause \"costs have risen, conditions have not changed, and the laws have not been amended\" since that\n\nstudy was conducted, the Mayor concluded that he would not propose annexation of the Okeechobee Center.\n\n        On June 12, 1995, four tenants of the Okeechobee Center7 and four black residents of the City\n\ninitiated this lawsuit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the City of Belle Glade, the Mayor of\n\nBelle Glade, the Belle Glade City Commission and its members, and the BGHA and its officers and members\n\nalleging that the BGHA's failure to petition for annexation and the City's failure to annex the Okeechobee\n\nCenter, as well as the City's practice of annexing property populated by whites, denied or abridged the rights\n\nof Appellants to vote on account of race or color in violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1994), and that these practices were adopted or purposefully maintained to dilute the\n\nvoting strength of Appellants and deprive them of their rights secured by the First, Thirteenth, Fourteenth,\n\nand Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994 &\n\nSupp. II 1996). Appellants further alleged that the BGHA's failure to petition for annexation discriminated\n\nagainst the tenants of the Okeechobee Center on the basis of race, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d to 2000d-4a (1994), and its implementing regulations, 7 C.F.R. § 15.3\n\n(1999). The district court dismissed Appellants' claims to the extent that they relied on the First and\n\nThirteenth Amendments, expressed its view that the remedy of forced annexation was not available under\n\nsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and dismissed Appellants' constitutional claims without prejudice for\n\nfailure to plead pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Appellants subsequently filed an amended complaint.\n\n        Prior to trial, each side moved for summary judgment. The City filed a motion on Appellants' claims\n\nunder section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, arguing that because the Okeechobee Center did not satisfy the\n\n\n\n\n   7\n    On March 24, 1997, the district court granted Okeechobee tenant Charles Jackson's motion to\nwithdraw as plaintiff. Three tenants remain in the suit.\n\n                                                      6\n\fstatutory requirements for annexation set forth in Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West Supp.1998), Appellants\n\nhad no available remedy. Appellants, in turn, moved for summary judgment on their constitutional claims.\n\nOn May 20, 1997, the district court granted summary judgment for Appellees on both the constitutional and\n\nVoting Rights Act claims. The court also granted summary judgment sua sponte for the BGHA on the\n\nremaining Title VI claims. Specifically, the district court held that because the Okeechobee Center was not\n\n\"contiguous\" to the City of Belle Glade, Florida law prohibited its annexation; that race discrimination did\n\nnot cause the City's refusal to annex the Okeechobee Center; that judicially-compelled annexation was not\n\nan available remedy under the Voting Rights Act; that an injunction prohibiting the City from discriminating\n\nin future annexation decisions was not sufficiently specific to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n65(d); and, lastly, that there was no meaningful relief available for Appellants' Title VI claim because, even\n\nif the district court ordered the BGHA to petition for annexation, Florida law still prohibited the City from\n\ngranting the request. See Burton v. City of Belle Glade, 966 F.Supp. 1178 (S.D.Fla.1997). This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n        We give plenary review to a district court's grant of summary judgment. See Harris v. Shelby County\n\nBd. of Educ., 99 F.3d 1078, 1082 (11th Cir.1996). The governing standard is by now well understood.\n\nSummary judgment is proper if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). As we have explained:\n\n        In assessing whether the movant has met this burden, the courts should view the evidence and all\n        factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. All\n        reasonable doubts about the facts should be resolved in favor of the non-movant. If the record\n        presents factual issues, the court must not decide them; it must deny the motion and proceed to trial.\n        Summary judgment may be inappropriate even where the parties agree on the basic facts, but disagree\n        about the inferences that should be drawn from these facts. If reasonable minds might differ on the\n        inferences arising from undisputed facts, then the court should deny summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fClemons v. Dougherty County, 684 F.2d 1365, 1368-69 (11th Cir.1982) (citations omitted). To withstand\n\na summary judgment motion, the non-moving party must establish that, based on the evidence in the record,\n\nthere can be more than one reasonable conclusion as to the proper verdict. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\n\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Consequently, \"[t]he mere existence of a\n\nscintilla of evidence in support of the [non-movant's] position will be insufficient; there must be evidence\n\non which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant].\" Id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505; see also Walker\n\nv. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1990).\n\n                                                      A.\n\n                       Section 1983: Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment Claims\n\n         Appellants8 contend that the BGHA's refusal to petition for annexation of the Okeechobee Center\n\nand the City's failure to annex the Center denied them the equal protection of the laws and deprived them of\n\nthe right to vote on account of race, both by denying their right to vote and by diluting their voting strength,\n\nin violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.9 Section 1983 provides a cause of action for\n\n\n\n   8\n     Both groups of Appellants—the black citizens and registered voters of Belle Glade and the black,\nnon-Belle-Glade-citizen tenants of the Okeechobee Center—make the same claims. We observe at the\noutset, however, that in a very real sense these claims are distinct. The Okeechobee Center tenants'\nclaimed injury stems from an allegedly improper racial motive in Appellees' annexation decisions\nconcerning the Okeechobee Center. These allegations give rise to a traditional race discrimination claim\nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and a vote denial claim under the\nFifteenth Amendment. In contrast, we construe the citizens of Belle Glade to complain that the BGHA\nand the City purposefully employed discriminatory practices to dilute the voting strength of black citizens\nwithin the City's boundaries. These discriminatory practices, if proved, allegedly injured Belle Glade\ncitizens because they enjoyed the right to vote in Belle Glade. Because the Okeechobee Center tenants\nnever possessed a right to vote within the City, Appellants' constitutional vote dilution claim may only be\npremised on the injuries of the Belle Glade citizens. See Socialist Workers Party v. Leahy, 145 F.3d\n1240, 1244 (11th Cir.1998). However, because vote dilution, vote denial, and traditional race\ndiscrimination claims arising under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments all require proof of\nintentional discrimination, see infra, we address Appellants' § 1983 claims as one.\n   9\n    The Supreme Court has not yet determined conclusively whether vote dilution is prohibited by the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, or both. See Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520\nU.S. 471, 495, 117 S.Ct. 1491, 137 L.Ed.2d 730 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (citing Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 617, 102 S.Ct. 3272, 73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982)\n(Fourteenth Amendment covers vote dilution claims); City of Mobile v.

United States, 425 U.S. 130, 142 n. 14, 96 S.Ct. 1357, 47\nL.Ed.2d 629 (1976)). Both Amendments, however, require proof of discriminatory purpose. See Bossier\nParish, 520 U.S. at 481, 117 S.Ct. 1491 (\"Since 1980, a plaintiff bringing a constitutional vote dilution\nchallenge, whether under the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, has been required to establish that the\nstate or political subdivision acted with a discriminatory purpose.\"); Lucas v. Townsend, 967 F.2d 549,\n551 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (holding that claims of vote dilution under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\nAmendment require proof of \"a racially discriminatory purpose chargeable to the state\"). Therefore, we\ndecline to address this distinction.\n\n        Appellants' initial complaint also alleged vote dilution claims under the First and Thirteenth\n        Amendments. Appellants argue that the district court erred in granting Appellees' motion to\n        dismiss those claims. But since the First and Thirteenth Amendments afford no greater protection\n        for voting rights claims than that already provided by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments,\n        see Washington v. Finlay, 664 F.2d 913, 927-28 (4th Cir.1981); Lucas v. Townsend, 783 F.Supp.\n        605, 618 (M.D.Ga.1992), aff'd on other grounds, 967 F.2d 549 (11th Cir.1992), we conclude that\n        the district court did not err in dismissing these claims.\n   10\n      Section 1983 provides, in relevant part, that \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of\nthe United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution\nand laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding\nfor redress....\" 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n                 Early in this litigation, Appellees moved to dismiss Appellants' First Amended Complaint\n        on the ground that they improperly pleaded claims directly under the Constitution. The district\n        court granted this motion without prejudice and Appellants filed a Second Amended Complaint.\n        Appellants now argue that the district court erred in dismissing their first complaint. However,\n        because Appellants were made whole by filing a second complaint, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), this\n        issue is now moot. See Purcell v. BankAtlantic Fin. Corp., 85 F.3d 1508, 1511 n. 3 (11th\n        Cir.1996) (\" 'Central to a finding of mootness is a determination by an appellate court that it\n        cannot grant effective judicial relief.' \") (quoting In re Club Assocs., 956 F.2d 1065, 1069 (11th\n        Cir.1992)).\n\n                                                      9\n\fCir.1998). Because Appellees concede they acted under color of state law, we need only address whether\n\nAppellees acted in violation of the Constitution.\n\n         Section 1983 claims, moreover, are governed by the forum state's residual personal injury statute of\n\nlimitations. See Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); Wilson v.\n\nGarcia, 471 U.S. 261, 276, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985). Specifically, a plaintiff must commence\n\na § 1983 claim arising in Florida within four years of the allegedly unconstitutional or otherwise illegal act.\n\nSee Baker v. Gulf & Western Indus., Inc., 850 F.2d 1480, 1483 (11th Cir.1988). The City's 1995 decision\n\nto deny Appellants' request for annexation of the Okeechobee Center is the only act that occurred during the\n\nlimitations period. Therefore, Appellants' § 1983 claims rest solely on the constitutionality of that decision.\n\n         Moreover, to establish a violation of either the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment or the Fifteenth Amendment, Appellants must show that the City's decision or act had a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose and effect. See Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 481, 117 S.Ct. 1491,\n\n137 L.Ed.2d 730 (1997); Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265,\n\n97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 241-42, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d\n\n597 (1976). Discriminatory purpose may be established by proof that the City used race as a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor in its annexation decisions and practices. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265-66, 97\n\nS.Ct. 555. If the City's annexation decisions created an express racial classification, no inquiry into\n\ndiscriminatory purpose is necessary. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 642, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511\n\n(1993) (citing Personnel Administrator v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979)).\n\nHowever, once a discriminatory purpose is established, the burden shifts to Appellees to prove that, at the\n\ntime of the discriminatory act, the same decision would have been made for a legitimate reason. See Mount\n\nHealthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).\n\n         We evaluate all available direct and circumstantial evidence of intent in determining whether a\n\ndiscriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in a particular decision. In Arlington Heights, the Supreme\n\n\n\n                                                      10\n\fCourt suggested that relevant evidentiary factors include substantial disparate impact, a history of\n\ndiscriminatory official actions, procedural and substantive departures from the norms generally followed by\n\nthe decision-maker, and the legislative and administrative history of the decision. See 429 U.S. at 265-69,\n\n97 S.Ct. 555. Moreover, we have repeatedly recognized that evidence of \" '[t]he historical background of the\n\ndecision' \" is relevant to the issue of discriminatory intent. Williams v. City of Dothan, 745 F.2d 1406, 1415\n\n(11th Cir.1984) (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267, 97 S.Ct. 555); see also Elston v. Talladega\n\nCounty Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d 1394, 1406 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that discriminatory intent may be\n\nestablished by, among other things, a history of discriminatory official actions); Ammons v. Dade City, 783\n\nF.2d 982, 988 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (noting that district court \"correctly relied upon a large body of\n\nconstitutional jurisprudence which recognizes that the historical context of a challenged activity may\n\nconstitute relevant evidence of intentional discrimination\"); Dowdell v. City of Apopka, 698 F.2d 1181, 1186\n\n(11th Cir.1983) (recognizing that historical pattern of decision-making was relevant to district court's finding\n\nof discriminatory intent). Indeed, all \"actions having foreseeable and anticipated disparate impact are relevant\n\nevidence to prove the ultimate fact, forbidden purpose.\" Columbus Bd. of Educ. v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 464,\n\n99 S.Ct. 2941, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979).11\n\n        At the heart of their appeal, Appellants argue that the district court erred in holding that no reasonable\n\njury could conclude that race was a substantial or motivating factor in the City's 1995 annexation decision.\n\nAppellants point to three categories of evidence supporting a claim of intentional race discrimination: first,\n\n\n\n\n   11\n      Appellants suggest that the district court erred in excluding relevant evidence that occurred outside\nof the statute of limitations period. Specifically, Appellants assert that the four-year statute of limitations\nshould not operate to exclude relevant historical evidence of past discriminatory practices. To the extent\nthe district court suggested that it would exclude evidence of discrimination that preceded the 1995 act at\nissue—the only act occurring within the limitations period—we believe that the district court erred. See\nCity of Dothan, 745 F.2d at 1415-16 (holding that district court erred in excluding evidence of municipal\ndecisions that occurred outside the statute of limitations period on ground that evidence was relevant to\nissue of defendant's later discriminatory intent). However, because the district court did, in fact, consider\nall of Appellants' evidence, see Burton, 966 F.Supp. at 1182, and because an examination of all of the\nproffered evidence does not alter the result, any error plainly would be harmless.\n\n                                                       11\n\fAppellants assert that since there was direct evidence of a de jure racial classification in Belle Glade housing\n\nbefore 1977, any inquiry into Appellees' discriminatory intent is unnecessary; second, they suggest that the\n\nbizarre shape of the City's municipal boundaries is circumstantial evidence of improper racial motive under\n\nShaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993); and third, they contend that they have\n\npresented substantial circumstantial evidence of the City's discriminatory intent in failing to annex the\n\nOkeechobee Center. Taken together, they argue, these categories of evidence raise a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to whether race was a substantial or motivating factor in the City's 1995 decision to refuse annexation\n\nof the Okeechobee Center. We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments either standing alone or in\n\nconcert, but consider each in turn.\n\n                                                       1.\n\n                                        De Jure Racial Classification\n\n        Appellants first argue that the City's annexation of the Osceola Center constituted the enforcement\n\nof a de jure racial classification. Because Belle Glade ordinances required racial segregation in residential\n\nhousing, Appellants contend that the City's annexation of the Osceola Center back in 1961 constituted the\n\nenforcement of a de jure racial classification. Appellants, therefore, assert that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to engage in the stringent review required for cases involving prior de jure segregation. This claim\n\nis unavailing.\n\n         The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to prohibit states\n\nfrom discriminating against individuals on the basis of race. Plainly, where the racial classification appears\n\non the face of the statute, no inquiry into legislative purpose is necessary. See Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642, 113\n\nS.Ct. 2816 (citing Feeney, 442 U.S. at 272, 99 S.Ct. 2282). Such racial classifications are presumptively\n\ninvalid and can only survive constitutional scrutiny if they are justified by a compelling state interest and are\n\nnarrowly tailored to serve that interest. See id. at 643, 113 S.Ct. 2816. Moreover, Appellants argue that\n\ndefendants should carry an even greater burden in this case, just as they do in the context of higher education.\n\n\n\n                                                       12\n\fSee United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 727-32, 112 S.Ct. 2727, 120 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992). Where there\n\nis evidence that a current practice is \"traceable\" to or is \"rooted\" in a prior policy of segregation in education,\n\ndefendants can only avoid liability by proving that the current policy does not have \"continuing segregative\n\neffects or, even if it does, that there exists no practicable and educationally sound means of remedying any\n\nsuch effects.\" Knight v. Alabama, 14 F.3d 1534, 1550 (11th Cir.1994).\n\n         In this case, however, the district court did not err in failing to require Appellees to prove that they\n\nattempted to remedy the effects of prior de jure segregation. In the first place, Appellants can point to no\n\ncourt that has ever applied Fordice outside of the education setting. Indeed, given the unique nature of school\n\ndesegregation, we hesitate to extend Fordice to a property annexation case. But even if we assume,\n\narguendo, that the analysis applies, Appellants have failed to demonstrate that the City's 1995 annexation\n\ndecision is, in any way, \"traceable\" to or \"rooted\" in past de jure segregation. Knight, 14 F.3d at 1540-41\n\n(noting that plaintiff has burden of proof to show that challenged policy is \"traceable\" to past segregation).\n\nThe City's 1961 decision to annex the Osceola Center, the white housing project, and the concomitant\n\n\"determination\" not to annex the Okeechobee Center, the black housing project, when the BGHA only\n\npetitioned for Osceola's annexation, neither created a racial classification nor enforced the City's segregation\n\nlaws. Although the two centers were segregated by race in 1961, on this record there is simply no evidence\n\nthat residential segregation laws dictated which center the City annexed, or, indeed, that race played any role\n\nin the process. Moreover, there is no evidence that the City had any policy, either in 1961 or later, of making\n\nannexation decisions on the basis of the race of the residents in the proposed annexation areas. It is even\n\nunclear on this record that the City ever entertained a request to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1961, or,\n\nfor that matter, that the Okeechobee Center was similarly situated to the Osceola Center, let alone evidence\n\nshowing that the decision to annex the Osceola Center was somehow based on the race of its occupants.\n\nNondiscriminatory reasons were offered to explain the Osceola annexation—including evidence that the\n\nBGHA requested annexation to provide City police protection to the residents due to ongoing threats against\n\n\n\n                                                        13\n\fthe center's manager—and Appellants have presented nothing to rebut this. While it is undeniably true that\n\nthe two centers were segregated by race in 1961, Appellants notably have been unable to draw some\n\nconnection between that de jure policy and the decision to annex the Osceola Center. Accordingly, we cannot\n\nfind that the City enforced any policy of racial classification in its annexation decisions. Absent such\n\nevidence, the district court did not err in refusing to require Appellees to present evidence of their efforts to\n\nremedy prior de jure segregation.\n\n        The very most Appellants could argue is that the existence of the City's segregation ordinances may\n\nhave raised an inference of discriminatory intent back in 1961. The existence of these ordinances, however,\n\nwhich were abolished more than twenty years before the 1995 decision, can in no way transform this cause\n\nof action into a challenge to the enforcement of a racial classification or de jure segregation.\n\n                                                       2.\n\n                                            Municipal Boundaries\n\n        Appellants also suggest that the municipal boundaries of the City of Belle Glade are so bizarre as to\n\nraise an inference of racially discriminatory intent under the racial gerrymandering case of Shaw v. Reno, 509\n\nU.S. 630, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993). Appellants assert that the City's decision to annex State\n\nRoad Number 80 in 1965 and its deliberate decision not to annex the black population centers on either side\n\nof the highway, rendered the boundaries of Belle Glade bizarre. They argue, therefore, that this annexation\n\nis facially suspect and triggers strict scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the district court\n\nagain erred in failing to shift the burden to Appellees to produce evidence that the municipal boundary was\n\nshaped by decisions that were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. We find this\n\nargument similarly unpersuasive.\n\n         To establish that a districting scheme amounts to impermissible racial gerrymandering, a plaintiff\n\nbears the burden of proving that race was the predominant factor in the legislature's decision either through\n\n\" 'circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics' or through 'more direct evidence going to\n\n\n\n                                                       14\n\flegislative purpose.' \" Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 905, 116 S.Ct. 1894, 135 L.Ed.2d 207 (1996) [hereinafter\n\nShaw II ] (quoting Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 132 L.Ed.2d 762 (1995)). As the\n\nSupreme Court explained in Miller:\n\n        Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary element of the constitutional wrong or a\n        threshold requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasive circumstantial evidence that race\n        for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature's dominant and controlling\n        rationale in drawing its district lines.\n\n515 U.S. at 913, 115 S.Ct. 2475. A plaintiff will not prevail, however, simply by pointing to the bizarre shape\n\nof a legislative district where the district lines are facially race neutral. Under those circumstances, \"a more\n\nsearching inquiry is necessary before strict scrutiny can be found applicable.\" Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952,\n\n958, 116 S.Ct. 1941, 135 L.Ed.2d 248 (1996) (plurality opinion) (quotations omitted). Moreover, a state may\n\ndefeat an allegation of racial gerrymandering by establishing that race-neutral considerations motivated the\n\nredistricting legislation and that those considerations were not \"subordinated\" to race. Miller, 515 U.S. at\n\n916, 115 S.Ct. 2475. Once a plaintiff proves that race was the predominant factor, however, the redistricting\n\ndecision then becomes subject to strict scrutiny: it must be justified by a compelling state interest and be\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 908, 116 S.Ct. 1894 (citing Miller, 515\n\nU.S. at 920, 115 S.Ct. 2475).\n\n         Appellants' Shaw argument faces multiple infirmities.12 To begin with, as far as we can discern, no\n\ncourt has ever applied Shaw outside the racial gerrymandering context. Moreover, Shaw and other racial\n\ngerrymandering cases are legally distinguishable from the instant case. In racial gerrymandering cases,\n\nplaintiffs typically challenge laws affirmatively enacted to alter the boundaries of voting districts. These\n\n\n\n   12\n      It is unclear whether all of the Appellants have standing to bring a Fourteenth Amendment claim\nunder Shaw. In United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 115 S.Ct. 2431, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995), the\nSupreme Court held that plaintiffs who reside in a racially gerrymandered district have standing to\nchallenge a legislature's reapportionment scheme. See id. at 745, 115 S.Ct. 2431. For non-resident\nplaintiffs to have standing, however, the Court noted that they would have to show specific evidence that\nthey were personally subjected to a racial classification. See id. Here, the non-BelleGlade-citizen\nAppellants would have to prove that they personally were not annexed into the City on the basis of their\nrace.\n\n                                                      15\n\fjurisdictions are under an affirmative legal duty to alter their boundaries to reflect shifts or alterations in\n\npopulation. In sharp contrast, however, is a city's right to determine if and when it will expand its municipal\n\nboundaries. Although the City of Belle Glade may well be bizarrely shaped, its contours were created over\n\nan extended time period as hundreds of individual parcels were brought into its ambit incrementally; it was\n\nnot created by a single scheme designed to exclude property on the basis of race. Cf. Chen v. City of Houston,\n\n9 F.Supp.2d 745, 754 (S.D.Tex.1998) (refusing to apply strict scrutiny under Shaw solely based on\n\nbizarreness of city's redistricting plan where repeated annexation, not districting decision-making, caused\n\nirregular shape of districts). Moreover, not surprisingly, Appellants have been unable to show that the\n\nannexation of any specific piece of property, including the Okeechobee Center, would make the shape of the\n\nCity of Belle Glade any less \"bizarre.\"\n\n         The central problem with Appellants' argument is that the City's shape has not been shown to have\n\nbeen created because of any affirmative annexation plan. Rather, the City's pattern of annexation over time\n\nmerely reflects the aggregation of various owners' requests for annexation, which the City generally approves\n\nso long as the proposed annexations satisfies the obligations of Florida law, and annexations initiated solely\n\nby the City, which also must conform to Florida law and which City voters and annex residents must approve\n\nby referendum. See Fla. Stat. Ann. §§ 171.044(1), 171.0413. Absent some other evidence, such as the\n\ncircumstances surrounding a multitude of other annexation decisions, the specific racial composition of each\n\nof these areas, whether the unincorporated areas ever requested annexation, or perhaps some comparison of\n\nthe shapes of other Florida municipalities, we cannot find that the municipal boundaries alone raise an\n\ninference of the City's racially discriminatory intent. Thus, whether or not a Shaw analysis could apply in\n\nthe context of municipal property annexation, the simple fact is that this record is wholly insufficient to raise\n\na genuine issue of material fact to support a distinct claim under Shaw.\n\n                                                       3.\n\n                                 Circumstantial Evidence of Discrimination\n\n\n\n                                                       16\n\f        Finally, Appellants claim that the circumstantial evidence, when weighed together, establishes the\n\nCity's discriminatory motive or intent in refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1995. Indeed,\n\nAppellants argue that the City's annexation decisions cannot be explained in non-racial terms. Appellants,\n\ntherefore, contend that the district court erred in concluding that they failed to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether race was a substantial or motivating factor behind the City's 1995 decision to\n\nrefuse annexation of the Okeechobee Center. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265-66, 97 S.Ct. 555.\n\nAppellants also assert that the district court further erred in failing to shift the burden to Appellees to prove\n\nthat, at the time of the discriminatory act, the same decision would have been made for a legitimate reason.\n\nSee Mount Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568. Appellants are incorrect on both counts.\n\n        Turning to the circumstantial evidence surrounding the 1995 decision, Appellants contend that two\n\nadditional pieces of evidence establish the City's discriminatory purpose. Appellants argue that the City's\n\njustification of costs in refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center raises an inference of race discrimination\n\nbecause the City does not usually consider costs when deciding whether to annex property. Appellants also\n\nassert that the City's view that Florida law prohibited annexation of the Okeechobee Center was a mere\n\npretext for the City's discriminatory purpose. Neither argument raises an inference of discriminatory intent.\n\n         First, the City's reliance on cost as a justification for refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center in\n\n1995 does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the City's allegedly improper racial motive.\n\nAppellants have offered no evidence to support their contention that the City does not usually consider cost\n\nin making annexation decisions. However, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that some disparity exists,\n\nwe fail to see how reliance on cost here raises an inference of race animus. As the Annexation Committee\n\nfound back in 1984, providing the necessary municipal services to the Okeechobee Center would be a very\n\nexpensive proposition for the City of Belle Glade. Moreover, because the property is exempt from ad\n\nvalorem taxes, the City would enjoy little revenue to offset this expense. Thus, the City's reliance on costs\n\nwas altogether reasonable under the circumstances. Indeed, a Florida municipality has an obligation to its\n\n\n\n                                                       17\n\fcitizens to consider the economic impact of annexations.13 Therefore, we decline to accept Appellants'\n\nsuggestion that the City's reliance on cost was a pretext for race discrimination.\n\n          Second, the City's conclusion that Florida law prohibited annexation of the Okeechobee center does\n\nnot raise an inference of race discrimination. The parties do not dispute that the Okeechobee Center could\n\nonly be annexed if contiguous to the City, and that its contiguity would arise only from its proximity to State\n\nRoad Number 80, which the City annexed in 1965. Therefore, Okeechobee's contiguity turns on whether a\n\nmunicipality may use a previously annexed road to gain contiguity to otherwise non-contiguous property.\n\nFlorida law, however, is hotly disputed and far from settled on this question.\n\n           Since 1974, Florida law has provided that an owner of reasonably compact14 property that is\n\ncontiguous15 to a municipality may petition for annexation. See Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West\n\n\n   13\n        Section 171.021 provides:\n\n                            The purposes of this act are to set forth procedures for adjusting the boundaries\n                  of municipalities through annexations or contractions or corporate limits and to set forth\n                  criteria for determining when annexations or contractions may take place so as to:\n\n                          (1) Insure sound urban development and accommodation to growth.\n\n                         (2) Establish uniform legislative standards throughout the state for the adjustment\n                  of municipal boundaries.\n\n                          (3) Insure the efficient provision of urban services to areas that become urban in\n                  character.\n\n                          (4) Insure that areas are not annexed unless municipal services can be provided to\n                  those areas.\n\n          Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.021.\n   14\n     \" 'Compactness' means concentration of a piece of property in a single area and precludes any action\nwhich would create enclaves, pockets, or finger areas in serpentine patterns.

Ann. § 171.031(12).\n   15\n     \" 'Contiguous' means that a substantial part of a boundary of the territory sought to be annexed by\nthe municipality is coterminous with a part of the boundary of the municipality.... However, nothing\nherein shall be construed to allow local rights-of-way, utility easements, railroad rights-of-way, or like\n\n                                                      18\n\fSupp.1998). In 1977, the Florida Attorney General considered whether Florida law permitted a municipality\n\nto annex property only contiguous to the municipality by virtue of a previously annexed road.16 See 1977 Fla.\n\nOp. Atty. Gen. 35. Recognizing that no Florida appellate court had considered the issue, the Attorney\n\nGeneral concluded that a parcel may not be voluntarily annexed if it is only contiguous to the City by virtue\n\nof a previously annexed highway because such annexation would violate both Florida's contiguity\n\nrequirement and its prohibition against the creation of enclaves. See id. Then, in 1985, the Attorney General\n\nconsidered whether a municipality could voluntarily annex property contiguous on one side to a previously\n\nannexed, 125 foot-wide corridor of unimproved land, but otherwise surrounded by unincorporated property.\n\nSee 1985 Fla. Op. Atty. Gen. 163. Although concluding that the city could not voluntarily annex the parcel\n\nbecause it would result in the creation of a prohibited enclave, the Attorney General found that Florida's\n\ncontiguity requirement would not prohibit the municipality from using the corridor of unimproved land to\n\ngain contiguity because the statute did not apply to property annexed before 1974. Id. The Attorney General,\n\nhowever, never reconciled his finding of contiguity in the 1985 opinion with the conclusion he had reached\n\neight years earlier.\n\n        Based on this undeniably conflicting authority, we conclude that the City's reliance on the 1974\n\nannexation statute as a justification for the denial of Peterson's request to annex the Okeechobee Center does\n\n\n\nentities to be annexed in a corridor fashion to gain contiguity....\" Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.031(11).\n\n                 Prior to 1975, section 171.031(11) stated, in relevant part: \"Local rights-of-way, utility\n        easements, or railroad rights-of-way shall not be annexed in a corridor fashion to gain contiguity\n        nor shall such activity be deemed to establish the contiguity required under this act.\" 1974 Fla.\n        Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (emphasis added). Since the underscored language was deleted in 1975, see\n        1975 Fla. Laws ch. 75-297, Appellants contend that the statute only prohibits annexation of roads\n        to gain contiguity, but it does not bar annexation of property contiguous to a previously annexed\n        road. Even assuming, arguendo, that Appellants' statutory interpretation is correct—and we have\n        no need to resolve this question of Florida law today—the amended language does not establish\n        that the City's statutory interpretation was unreasonable.\n   16\n     Although Florida Opinions of the Attorney General are not binding on this Court, they \"are entitled\nto careful consideration and generally should be regarded as highly persuasive\" of matters of Florida law.\nState v. Family Bank of Hallandale, 623 So.2d 474, 478 (Fla.1993).\n\n                                                     19\n\fnot raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the City's discriminatory intent in 1995. Even if we were to\n\ndetermine today that Florida law permits annexation—and the law is anything but clear as to this matter—we\n\nwould still conclude that the City's interpretation was an altogether reasonable one given the plainly\n\nconflicting Attorney General opinions.17 In short, the City's reliance on the 1974 annexation statute cannot\n\nfairly be taken as being a pretext for race discrimination.\n\n         The only other evidence presented by Appellants relates to the historical background to the City's\n\n1995 decision. However, \"the historical background for a given decision is only one factor relative to intent.\n\nIt does not, by itself, compel [a court] to find a discriminatory purpose behind every statute passed during\n\nregrettable periods of [a state's] past.\" Hall v. Holder, 117 F.3d 1222, 1226-27 (11th Cir.1997). Nevertheless,\n\nAppellants point to three pieces of historical evidence. First, the City's housing ordinances mandated\n\nresidential segregation until 1963. Second, the Osceola and Okeechobee Centers were segregated by race\n\nuntil 1977. Lastly, the BGHA failed to petition the Okeechobee Center in 1961 and 1973 and the City failed\n\nto annex in 1961, 1971, and 1985. This evidence is far too remote and attenuated to be probative of any\n\ndiscriminatory purpose in 1995. Simply put, we fail to see how evidence of past residential segregation in\n\nhousing, which ended almost twenty years before the decision at issue, and which is wholly unconnected to\n\nany annexation decision, or a prior refusal to annex standing alone establishes any intent, let alone a\n\ndiscriminatory one, in 1995. As we said in Holder, \"past discrimination cannot, in the manner of original sin,\n\ncondemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful.\" Id. (quoting Mobile, 446 U.S. at 74, 100 S.Ct.\n\n\n\n   17\n     Indeed, the district court determined that the City's interpretation was correct as a matter of statutory\nconstruction. See Burton, 966 F.Supp. at 1183. According to the district court, the propriety of using a\nroad annexation to gain contiguity cannot turn on the subjective intent of the municipality in initially\nannexing the road. The court reasoned that the Florida legislature could not have intended for so strange\na construction. See id. at 1183-84. However, we need not reach the merits of this issue to resolve the\ninstant case.\n\n                 Concluding that the proposed annexation of the Okeechobee Center would have been\n        illegal under Florida law since 1974, the district court also held that this statute was the\n        intervening cause of Appellants' injuries. See Burton, 966 F.Supp. at 1183-84. Again, it is\n        unnecessary to reach the merits of this issue.\n\n                                                      20\n\f1490); see also Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 495-96, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992).\n\nAppellants' historical evidence does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City's 1995\n\ndecision to refuse annexation of the Okeechobee Center was motivated by race.\n\n          On the basis of this record, viewing all of the circumstantial evidence and drawing all inferences in\n\nthe light most favorable to Appellants, we conclude that Appellants have failed to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether the City's 1995 decision was racially motivated. No jury could reasonably find\n\nfor Appellants based on this record. In the first place, the City's reliance on cost—a possible expense to the\n\nCity of close to one million dollars—was an altogether reasonable basis on which to refuse annexation.\n\nSecond, the City's reliance on Florida's contiguity requirement to deny annexation was likewise reasonable\n\ngiven the conflicting authority in Florida law, and in no way supports an inference of pretext for race\n\ndiscrimination. Lastly, Appellants' historical evidence, which at most arguably raised an inference of the\n\nCity's discriminatory intent in the 1960s and 1970s, offers no plausible connection between any conceivable\n\ndiscriminatory intent rooted in the past and the 1995 act at issue today. Taken together, this evidence does\n\nnot raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the City's discriminatory intent in 1995.\n\n          Finally, the district court did not err in failing to consider the second prong of the Mount Healthy test.\n\nIf Appellants cannot first prove that race was a motivating factor, there is no basis for shifting the burden to\n\nthe City to determine whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, it would have made the same decision\n\nnotwithstanding its racial motivation. See Mount Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568. Accordingly, we\n\nhold that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on Appellants' § 1983\n\nclaims.\n\n                                                         B.\n\n                                   Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965\n\n          Appellants also contend that the BGHA's refusal to petition and the City's failure to annex the\n\nOkeechobee Center violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Section 2, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, \"was\n\n\n\n                                                         21\n\fdesigned as a means of eradicating voting practices that 'minimize or cancel out the voting strength and\n\npolitical effectiveness of minority groups.' \" Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 479, 117 S.Ct.\n\n1491, 137 L.Ed.2d 730 (1997) (quoting S.Rep. No. 97-417, at 28 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n177, 205). It \"prohibits all forms of voting discrimination.\" Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 45 n. 10, 106\n\nS.Ct. 2752, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986) (citing S.Rep. No. 97-417 at 30, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 207-\n\n08). Specifically, two distinct types of discriminatory practices and procedures are covered under section 2:\n\nthose that result in \"vote denial\" and those that result in \"vote dilution.\"\n\n        In 1982, Congress amended section 2 to clarify that a plaintiff may establish a violation by a showing\n\nof discriminatory results alone.18 See Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-205, § 3, 96\n\nStat. 131, 134 (1982). As amended, section 2 states:\n\n                (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall\n        be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or\n        abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color, or in\n        contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 1973b(f)(2)19 of this title, as provided in\n        subsection (b) of this section.\n\n                 (b) A violation of subsection (a) of this section is established if, based on the totality of the\n        circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State\n        or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens\n        protected by subsection (a) of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other\n        members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their\n        choice. The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or\n        political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered: Provided, That nothing in this\n        section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their\n        proportion in the population.\n\n\n\n\n   18\n     This amendment superceded the Supreme Court's decision in City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55,\n61-62, 100 S.Ct. 1490 (1980) (plurality opinion), which had held that both the Fifteenth Amendment and\nsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act require proof of intentional discrimination.\n   19\n      Section 1973b(f)(2) provides: \"No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard,\npractice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge\nthe right of any citizen of the United States to vote because he is a member of a language minority group.\"\n42 U.S.C. § 1973b(f)(2) (1994).\n\n                                                       22\n\f42 U.S.C. § 1973(a), (b). Subsection (b) has come to be known as the \"results test\" because it seeks to\n\nmeasure the effect of vote dilution.20\n\n\n\n   20\n     A Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendment sets forth \" 'typical factors' \" that may show a\nviolation of section 2 under this test. Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (quoting S.Rep. No. 97-417\nat 28-29, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206-207). These factors include:\n\n                          \"1. the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or political\n                 subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to register, to\n                 vote, or otherwise to participate in the democratic process;\n\n                          2. the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision\n                 is racially polarized;\n\n                         3. the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large\n                 election districts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other voting\n                 practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the\n                 minority group;\n\n                        4. if there is a candidate slating process, whether the members of the minority\n                 group have been denied access to that process;\n\n                         5. the extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political\n                 subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment and\n                 health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process;\n\n                         6. whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial\n                 appeals; [and]\n\n                          7. the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public\n                 office in the jurisdiction.\n\n                          Additional factors that in some cases have had probative value as part of\n                 plaintiffs' evidence to establish a violation are:\n\n                         whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected\n                         officials to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group [and]\n\n                         whether the policy underlying the state or political subdivision's use of such\n                         voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice or procedure is\n                         tenuous.\"\n\n        Id. at 36-37, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (quoting S.Rep. No. 97-417 at 28-29, reprinted in 1982\n        U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206-07). However, \" 'there is no requirement that any particular number of\n        factors be proved, or that a majority of them point one way or the other.' \" Id. at 45, 106 S.Ct.\n        2752 (quoting S.Rep. No. 97-417 at 29, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206-07).\n\n                                                      23\n\f           Appellants have alleged claims of both vote denial and vote dilution.21 The district court, however,\n\nelected not to reach the merits of either of Appellant's section 2 claims. Rather, the district court granted\n\nAppellees' motion for summary judgment explaining that mandatory annexation is not an available remedy\n\nunder the Voting Rights Act. The district court also considered each of the required factors in a vote dilution\n\nclaim, see infra II.B.2, and concluded that it doubted whether Appellants had even made a prima facie\n\nshowing under section 2. See Burton, 966 F.Supp. at 1186 n. 10. After thoroughly searching this record, we\n\nlikewise conclude that Appellants have failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to either vote\n\ndenial or vote dilution under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.22 On the record presented, we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that court-ordered annexation is not an appropriate remedy to redress either of Appellants'\n\nalleged injuries—vote denial or vote dilution.23\n\n                                                        1.\n\n                                                  Vote Denial\n\n\n\n\n   21\n     Appellants' vote dilution claim, we believe, may be premised only upon the claimed injuries of Belle\nGlade's black citizens. This is true because only those who enjoy the right to vote in Belle Glade may\nhave their voting strength diluted by the City's annexation decisions. In contrast, Appellants' vote denial\nclaim may only arise from injuries of black tenants of the Okeechobee Center. See supra note 8.\n   22\n     We need not reach the question of whether a challenge to a city's failure to annex adjacent property\nis cognizable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In Perkins v. Matthews, the Supreme Court held\nthat municipal annexation is a \" 'standard, practice or procedure with respect to voting' \" that is subject to\npreclearance under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. 400 U.S. 379, 388, 91 S.Ct. 431, 27 L.Ed.2d 476\n(1971) (quoting Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 5, 42 U.S.C. § 1973c). Sections 2 and 5, however, \"combat\ndifferent evils and ... impose very different duties upon the States.\" See Bossier Parish, 520 U.S. 471,\n477, 117 S.Ct. 1491, 137 L.Ed.2d 730 (1997). We only assume, arguendo, that the City of Belle Glade's\nrefusal to annex the Okeechobee Center is a \"standard, practice, or procedure\" that gives rise to a claim\nunder section 2. 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a). But see Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S. 874, 884, 114 S.Ct. 2581, 129\nL.Ed.2d 687 (1994) (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J.) (\"[W]e think it quite improbable\nto suggest that a § 2 dilution challenge could be brought to a town's existing political boundaries (in an\nattempt to force it to annex surrounding land) by arguing that the current boundaries dilute a racial\ngroup's voting strength in comparison to the proposed new boundaries.\").\n   23\n        We address the availability of a remedy as part of Appellants' prima facie case of vote dilution.\n\n                                                       24\n\f         Vote denial occurs when a state, or here a municipality, employs a \"standard, practice, or procedure\"\n\nthat results in the denial of the right to vote on account of race. 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a). To prevail, Appellants\n\nmust prove that, \"under the totality of the circumstances, ... the political processes ... are not equally open to\n\nparticipation by [members of a protected class] ... in that its members have less opportunity than other\n\nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).

No. 97-417 at 27, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 205); see factors listed\n\nsupra note 20.\n\n         Appellants have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they were denied the\n\nright to vote on account of race. First, they have not offered any evidence of a \" 'history of official\n\ndiscrimination in the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group\n\nto register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the democratic process.' \" Gingles, 478 U.S. at 36-37, 106\n\nS.Ct. 2752 (quoting S.Rep. No. 97-417 at 28, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206). Although Appellants\n\nhave presented evidence of housing segregation in Belle Glade and in the two centers, we can find no\n\nevidence of any discrimination with respect to voting. Second, there is no evidence that Belle Glade uses or\n\nused any \" 'voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the\n\nminority group.' \" Id. at 37, 106 S.Ct. 2752 (quoting S.Rep. No. 97-417 at 28, reprinted in 1982\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 206). Third, we can find no evidence in this record that the black citizens of Belle Glade\n\n\" 'bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment and health, which hinder their\n\nability to participate effectively in the political process.' \" Id. (quoting S.Rep. No. 97-417 at 28, reprinted\n\nin 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 206).

Nor is there any circumstantial evidence\n\n\n\n                                                       25\n\ftending to suggest that the tenants of the Okeechobee Center were denied the right to vote on account of their\n\nrace. Simply put, Appellants have failed to meet their burden of proving vote denial under section 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act.\n\n                                                        2.\n\n                                                  Vote Dilution\n\n         In contrast, vote dilution occurs when an election practice results in the dilution of minority voting\n\nstrength and, thus, impairs a minority's ability to elect the representative of its choice.\n\n         In Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court identified three threshold preconditions for establishing\n\na section 2 vote dilution claim: (1) \"the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large\n\nand geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district\"; (2) \"the minority group\n\nmust be able to show that it is politically cohesive\"; and (3) \"the minority group must be able to demonstrate\n\nthat the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it ... usually to defeat the minority's preferred\n\ncandidate.\"24 478 U.S. 30, 50-51, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986). Proof of each of these Gingles\n\nfactors is necessary, but not sufficient, to prevail under a section 2 vote dilution claim. See id. at 50, 106 S.Ct.\n\n2752. Upon successfully establishing each of the Gingles prerequisites, plaintiffs also must show that, under\n\nthe totality of the circumstances, the challenged electoral scheme deprives them of \"an equal measure of\n\npolitical and electoral opportunity\" to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their\n\nchoosing. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1013, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994).\n\n\n\n   24\n      The Supreme Court has recognized that the Gingles factors \"cannot be applied mechanically without\nregard to the nature of the claim.\" Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 158, 113 S.Ct. 1149, 122 L.Ed.2d\n500 (1993). To date, the Court has applied these factors to section 2 vote dilution claims challenging\nmulti-member districts, see Gingles, 478 U.S. at 48-51, 106 S.Ct. 2752; single-member districts, see\nGrowe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993); and majority-minority\ndistricts, see Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 153-54, 113 S.Ct. 1149. Moreover, in Brooks v. Miller, we recently\napplied the Gingles factors to a section 2 claim challenging a majority vote requirement. See 158 F.3d\n1230, 1239 (11th Cir.1998), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 119 S.Ct. 1805, --- L.Ed.2d ----, 67 U.S.L.W. 3614\n(U.S. May 24, 1999) (No. 98-1521). No court has ever addressed, however, whether the Gingles factors\napply to a vote dilution claim premised on a failure to annex. Because Appellants have failed to meet the\nthree Gingles preconditions, we have no need to reach the merits of this question either.\n\n                                                        26\n\f        Appellants have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to any of the three Gingles\n\nprerequisites, and, therefore, their section 2 vote dilution claim must fail as well. We address each Gingles\n\nfactor in turn.\n\n         We have repeatedly construed the first Gingles factor as requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate the\n\nexistence of a proper remedy. See Brooks v. Miller, 158 F.3d 1230, 1239 (11th Cir.1998), cert. denied, ---\n\nU.S. ----, 119 S.Ct. 1805, --- L.Ed.2d ----, 67 U.S.L.W. 3614 (U.S. May 24, 1999) (No. 98-1521); Davis v.\n\nChiles, 139 F.3d 1414, 1419 (11th Cir.1998), cert. denied, --- U.S.----, 119 S.Ct. 1139, 143 L.Ed.2d 208\n\n(1999); Southern Christian Leadership Conference v. Sessions, 56 F.3d 1281, 1289, 1294-97 (11th Cir.1995)\n\n(en banc); Nipper v. Smith, 39 F.3d 1494, 1530-31 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc). This requirement simply\n\nserves \" 'to establish that the minority has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice from some\n\nsingle-member district.' \" Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1530 (quoting Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40, 113 S.Ct.\n\n1075, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993)). Thus, if a minority cannot establish that an alternate election scheme exists\n\nthat would provide better access to the political process, then the challenged voting practice is not responsible\n\nfor the claimed injury. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50, 106 S.Ct. 2752. As we explained in Nipper:\n\n        The inquiries into remedy and liability ... cannot be separated: A district court must determine as part\n        of the Gingles threshold inquiry whether it can fashion a permissible remedy in the particular context\n        of the challenged system.\n\n        ....\n\n        ... The absence of an available remedy is not only relevant at the remedial stage of the litigation but\n        also precludes, under the totality of the circumstances inquiry, a finding of liability.\n\n39 F.3d at 1530-31, 1533. Accordingly, the failure to establish the first Gingles factor—the availability of\n\na remedy—is fatal to a plaintiff's section 2 claim.\n\n        Appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that court-ordered annexation and an\n\ninjunction against future discrimination in annexation decisions are not available remedies under the Voting\n\nRights Act. We disagree. Specifically, Appellants prayed for two different forms of relief to redress their\n\nsection 2 claims: an order requiring Belle Glade \"to take all steps necessary to effectuate the annexation of\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fthe Okeechobee Center\" into Belle Glade, and an injunction prohibiting Belle Glade \"from enforcing any and\n\nall racially discriminatory policy(ies) in their decisions as to which parcels of land to annex.\"25 Neither of\n\nthese remedies are appropriate.\n\n         Court-ordered annexation is a remedy of unprecedented scope and magnitude. Indeed, we are not\n\nsurprised that Appellants cannot point to a single case, nor have we been able to find one, that has ordered\n\nso unusual a remedy. For it is one thing for a court sitting in equity to proscribe policymakers from\n\nemploying unambiguously racial bases for decision-making and to order government entities to make\n\nannexation decisions on race-neutral grounds, but it is quite another to force a municipality to expand its\n\nphysical boundaries by annexation. Moreover, courtordered annexation would bypass an inherently complex\n\npolitical process. A municipality's decision when and where to annex unincorporated property requires a\n\nseries of carefully-calibrated political and economic judgments. For example, a municipality undoubtedly\n\nmust consider whether the property is reasonably compact and contiguous to the municipality, whether it\n\ncontains a sufficient financial base, whether annexation will require a substantial increase in municipal\n\nservices, and whether annexation will confer any non-pecuniary benefits to the municipality. Only after\n\nmeasured evaluation of these and other factors would a municipality elect to proceed with annexation. In\n\nstark contrast, court-ordered annexation circumvents this political process, and may result in numerous\n\nunintended adverse consequences.26\n\n\n\n\n   25\n    Notably, Appellants have not sought the wholly impracticable remedy of deannexing the Osceola\nCenter, after close to forty years of Belle Glade citizenship.\n   26\n      Moreover, to the extent court-ordered annexation would require the municipality to raise taxes in\norder to absorb the new property, the remedy would run up against Supreme Court precedent in school\ndesegregation cases. In such cases, the Supreme Court has held that court-ordered tax increases\ncontravene \"the principles of comity that must govern the exercise of the District Court's equitable\ndiscretion.\" Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 50, 110 S.Ct. 1651, 109 L.Ed.2d 31 (1990); see also\nSpallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 276, 110 S.Ct. 625, 107 L.Ed.2d 644 (1990) (noting that court's\n\"broad equitable powers\" to remedy past discrimination are not unlimited and should \"take into account\nthe interests of state and local authorities in managing their own affairs\" (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted)).\n\n                                                     28\n\f         We do not suggest that a federal court would never have the power to order annexation. It is enough\n\nfor us to conclude that the extraordinary and unprecedented remedy of court-ordered annexation is wholly\n\ninappropriate on the facts presented. This conclusion in no way rests on a determination that Florida law\n\nprohibits annexation of the Okeechobee Center. Indeed, we agree with the parties that where federal statutory\n\nor constitutional rights have been violated, state law will not impede a court from fashioning an appropriate\n\nremedy. See Armstrong v. Adams, 869 F.2d 410, 414 (8th Cir.1989). We find on this record only that the\n\ndistrict court did not err in concluding that court-ordered annexation was an inappropriate remedy to redress\n\nAppellants' claims under the Voting Rights Act.\n\n         Turning to Appellants' alternate remedy, the district court correctly determined that an injunction\n\nordering the City not to discriminate in future annexation decisions would not satisfy the specificity\n\nrequirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under Rule 65(d), \"[e]very order granting an\n\ninjunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms;\n\n[and] shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or\n\nacts sought to be restrained.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d). This specificity requirement is necessary \"to protect those\n\nwho are enjoined 'by informing them of what they are called upon to do or to refrain from doing in order to\n\ncomply with the injunction or restraining order.' \" Hughey v. JMS Dev. Corp., 78 F.3d 1523, 1531 (11th\n\nCir.1996) (quoting 11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 2955 (2d ed.1995) (footnotes omitted)). Thus, an injunction must \"contain 'an operative\n\ncommand capable of enforcement.' \" Id. (quoting International Longshoremen's Ass'n v. Philadelphia Marine\n\nTrade Ass'n, 389 U.S. 64, 73-74, 88 S.Ct. 201, 19 L.Ed.2d 236 (1967)). For example, in Payne v. Travenol\n\nLabs., Inc., 565 F.2d 895 (5th Cir.1978), the former Fifth Circuit27 considered an injunction that prohibited\n\n\"discriminating on the basis of color, race, or sex in employment practices or conditions of employment.\"\n\n\n\n\n   27\n     In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as\nbinding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.\n\n                                                      29\n\fId. at 897. Invalidating the injunction for failure to satisfy Rule 65(d)'s specificity requirement, the Court\n\nreasoned that where the terms of the injunction are as general as Title VII itself, the injunction does no more\n\nthan instruct a defendant to \"obey the law.\" Id. at 898. A court is incapable of enforcing so broad and vague\n\nan injunction.\n\n        Appellants seek to enjoin the City from discriminating on the basis of race in its annexation decisions.\n\nAs this injunction would do no more than instruct the City to \"obey the law,\" we believe that it would not\n\nsatisfy the specificity requirements of Rule 65(d) and that it would be incapable of enforcement. See Payne,\n\n565 F.2d at 898. In short, an injunction prohibiting the City from discriminating against the Okeechobee\n\nCenter in future annexation decisions is not an available remedy to redress Appellants' alleged injuries.\n\n         On this record, Appellants have not established a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence\n\nof an appropriate remedy sufficient to satisfy the first Gingles prerequisite. Notwithstanding Appellants'\n\nfailure to identify a suitable remedy, \"a federal court should not dismiss a meritorious constitutional claim\n\nbecause the complaint seeks one remedy rather than another plainly appropriate one.\" Holt Civic Club v. City\n\nof Tuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 65, 99 S.Ct. 383, 58 L.Ed.2d 292 (1978). However, we cannot conceive of an\n\nalternative remedy for Appellants' claims. In short, we hold that Appellants cannot meet the first Gingles\n\nprerequisite.\n\n         Although the absence of an available remedy is dispositive of Appellants' claim, we nonetheless\n\nconsider the second and third Gingles factors. Appellant's have similarly failed to establish a genuine issue\n\nof material fact as to either of these elements. The second factor requires a showing that the minority group\n\nis politically cohesive, while the third demands proof of a majority white voting bloc sufficient to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidates. See Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51, 106 S.Ct. 2752. In other words, \"[p]roof\n\nof the second and third Gingles factors ... is circumstantial evidence of racial bias operating through the\n\nelectoral system to deny minority voters equal access to the political process.\" Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1524. The\n\nexistence of these factors, together with an appropriate remedy, as well as an assessment under the totality\n\n\n\n                                                      30\n\fof the circumstances, generally will be sufficient to establish that the challenged practice allows racial bias\n\nto dilute the voting strength of the minority population. See id. at 1524-25.\n\n        Here, Appellants have offered no evidence of political cohesion or a majority white voting bloc.\n\nIndeed, as discussed earlier, Appellants' only evidence concerns allegations of Appellees' discriminatory\n\nintent. This evidence is wholly insufficient to meet the requirements of the Gingles factors. Given the dearth\n\nof relevant evidence as to Appellants' section 2 vote dilution claim, Appellants have failed to establish a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact concerning the second or third prerequisite under Gingles. We conclude,\n\ntherefore, that Appellants have also failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to vote dilution, and\n\nhold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to Appellees on both of Appellants' section\n\n2 claims.\n\n                                                       C.\n\n                                    Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\n         There are two distinct causes of action arising under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000d to 2000d-4a. First, the Supreme Court has recognized a private cause of action to enforce\n\nsection 601, which prohibits any recipient of federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of\n\nrace, color, or national origin in any federally funded program.28 See Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 293-\n\n94, 105 S.Ct. 712, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985); Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 463 U.S. 582, 607 n. 27,\n\n103 S.Ct. 3221, 77 L.Ed.2d 866 (1983); id. at 608 n. 1, 103 S.Ct. 3221 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment);\n\nsee also Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 70, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992).\n\nTo state such a claim, a plaintiff must establish discriminatory intent. See Alexander, 469 U.S. at 293, 105\n\nS.Ct. 712. Accordingly, Title VI's protection extends no further than that already afforded under the Equal\n\n\n\n\n   28\n     Section 601 of Title VI provides: \"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color,\nor national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" Civil Rights Act of\n1964 § 601, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.\n\n                                                       31\n\fProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 732 n. 7, 112\n\nS.Ct. 2727, 120 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992); Elston v. Talladega County Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d 1394, 1405 n. 11,\n\n1406 (11th Cir.1993) (citing Alexander, 469 U.S. at 293, 105 S.Ct. 712; Guardians, 463 U.S. at 584 n. 2,\n\n103 S.Ct. 3221; Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v. Georgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1417 (11th\n\nCir.1985)).\n\n           Second, we have recognized an implied private right of action to enforce the regulations promulgated\n\nunder section 602 of Title VI.29 See Elston, 997 F.2d at 1407; Georgia State Conference, 775 F.2d at 1417.\n\nThese regulations prohibit recipients of federal funds from taking any action that results in disparate impact\n\n\n\n\n   29\n        Section 602 of Title VI provides:\n\n                            Each Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal\n                   financial assistance to any program or activity, by way of grant, loan, or contract other\n                   than a contract of insurance or guaranty, is authorized and directed to effectuate the\n                   provisions of section 2000d of this title with respect to such program or activity by\n                   issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with\n                   achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance in\n                   connection with which the action is taken. No such rule, regulation, or order shall\n                   become effective unless and until approved by the President. Compliance with any\n                   requirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected (1) by the termination of or\n                   refusal to grant or to continue assistance under such program or activity to any recipient\n                   as to whom there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing,\n                   of a failure to comply with such requirement, but such termination or refusal shall be\n                   limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other recipient as to whom\n                   such a finding has been made and, shall be limited in its effect to the particular program,\n                   or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found, or (2) by any other\n                   means authorized by law: Provided, however, That no such action shall be taken until the\n                   department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the\n                   failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be\n                   secured by voluntary means. In the case of any action terminating, or refusing to grant or\n                   continue, assistance because of failure to comply with a requirement imposed pursuant to\n                   this section, the head of the Federal department or agency shall file with the committees\n                   of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity\n                   involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. No\n                   such action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such\n                   report.\n\n           Civil Rights Act of 1964 § 602, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1.\n\n                                                       32\n\for discriminatory effects on the basis of race, color, or national origin.30 Under this cause of action, unlike\n\na claim arising under section 601, a plaintiff may obtain injunctive or declaratory relief by showing, inter alia,\n\nthat the challenged action has \"a disparate impact on groups protected by the statute, even if those actions are\n\nnot intentionally discriminatory.\" Elston, 997 F.2d at 1406 (citing Alexander, 469 U.S. at 292-94, 105 S.Ct.\n\n712; Guardians, 463 U.S. at 584 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. 3221; Georgia State Conference, 775 F.2d at 1417).\n\n           Appellants have raised both of these claims under Title VI. First, they assert that the BGHA\n\nintentionally discriminated against the tenants of the Okeechobee Center on the basis of race in violation of\n\nsection 601 of Title VI by refusing to petition for annexation. Second, Appellants allege that the BGHA's\n\nfailure to petition resulted in discriminatory effects on the basis of race in violation of the disparate impact\n\nregulations promulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI. The district court granted the BGHA summary\n\njudgment sua sponte on both of these claims, specifically concluding that no meaningful relief could be\n\nfashioned to remedy the alleged wrong. Appellants contend that this decision was error. Even if the district\n\ncourt were correct that it could not order annexation, Appellants argue that the court could have ordered the\n\n\n\n   30\n        The Department of Agriculture has promulgated the following regulations relevant to this litigation:\n\n                            (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other\n                   benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of\n                   individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other\n                   benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program or the class of individuals\n                   to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or\n                   through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration\n                   which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race,\n                   color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing\n                   accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals of a particular\n                   race, color, or national origin.\n\n                           (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, an applicant or recipient may\n                   not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying\n                   them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any of its activities or\n                   programs to which the regulations in this part apply, on the grounds of race, color, or\n                   national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the\n                   accomplishment of the objectives of the Act and the regulations in this part.\n\n           7 C.F.R. § 15.3(b)(2), (3).\n\n                                                        33\n\fBGHA to equalize the benefits and services between the two centers. Appellants contend, for example, that\n\nthe City levies a 50% surcharge for water on the Okeechobee Center tenants. The City does not impose this\n\ncharge on the Osceola Center tenants because that center is located within the City's municipal boundaries.\n\nAlthough we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgement sua sponte31 to Appellee\n\nBGHA with respect to Appellants' claim arising under section 601, our review of the record compels the\n\nconclusion that Appellants were not afforded a sufficient opportunity to be heard on their disparate impact\n\nclaim arising from the regulations promulgated under section 602 of Title VI.\n\n        A district court possesses the power to enter summary judgment sua sponte provided the losing party\n\n\"was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n\n317, 326, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), motions for summary judgment\n\nmust be served on opponents at least ten days prior to the hearing. As we have long recognized, \"this notice\n\nprovision is not an unimportant technicality, but a vital procedural safeguard\" to a party's right to offer the\n\nbest defense to any challenge. Massey v. Congress Life Ins. Co., 116 F.3d 1414, 1417 (11th Cir.1997) (citing\n\nNational Fire Ins. v. Bartolazo, 27 F.3d 518, 520 (11th Cir.1994); Hanson v. Polk County Land, Inc., 608\n\nF.2d 129, 131 (5th Cir.1979)). But so long as the party against whom judgment will be entered is given\n\nsufficient advance notice and has been afforded an adequate opportunity to demonstrate why summary\n\njudgment should not be granted, then granting summary judgment sua sponte is entirely appropriate. See 10A\n\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2720 (3d\n\ned.1998).\n\n\n\n\n   31\n     Contrary to the district court's suggestion that Appellants' Title VI claims were properly presented on\nmotion, we believe that the district court entered summary judgment as to these claims sua sponte. See\nBurton, 966 F.Supp. at 1187 n. 11. The City only moved for summary judgment on Appellants' Voting\nRights Act claims on the ground that, as a matter of law, it could not be compelled to annex the\nOkeechobee Center. The district court concluded that the unavailability of the equitable remedy of\ncompelled annexation barred all of Appellants' claims. However, because the unavailability of\ncourt-ordered annexation is not dispositive of Appellants' Title VI claims against the BGHA, we cannot\nsay that any party had, in fact, moved for summary judgment on the Title VI claims.\n\n                                                      34\n\f         Appellants could survive summary judgment on their claim arising under section 601 only if they\n\nestablish a genuine issue of material fact as to the BGHA's discriminatory intent after June 13, 1991, four\n\nyears prior to the initiation of this lawsuit.32 Appellants' § 1983 claims also required proof of discriminatory\n\nintent during that same period. However, because Appellants themselves moved for summary judgment on\n\ntheir § 1983 claims, it follows that they, in fact, had more than reasonable opportunity to marshal the same\n\nevidence of intent in support of their Title VI claim as well. And since Appellants plainly failed to adduce\n\nsufficient evidence as to intent with respect to any portion of their § 1983 claims, it likewise follows a fortiori\n\nthat they could not present sufficient evidence of intent as to this Title VI claim either. Thus, the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment sua sponte to the BGHA as to Appellants' section 601 claim.\n\n         In contrast, Appellants were not afforded sufficient opportunity to defend against summary judgment\n\nwith respect to their cause of action to enforce the disparate impact regulations promulgated under section\n\n602 of Title VI. To survive summary judgment, in this context, Appellants must establish, among other\n\nthings, a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the BGHA's failure to petition for annexation of the\n\nOkeechobee Center resulted in a disparate impact on the Okeechobee Center tenants on the basis of race. See\n\nElston, 997 F.2d at 1407. Appellants simply did not have an opportunity to develop or marshal this type of\n\nevidence. As we have observed, Appellants' § 1983 claims turned on evidence of the City's discriminatory\n\nintent in refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1995. Moreover, Appellants' claims under the Voting\n\nRights Act required evidence of an available remedy—court-ordered annexation or an injunction prohibiting\n\nthe City from discriminating on the basis of race. But the evidence required to establish these claims is not\n\ndispositive of any disparate impact the BGHA's actions may have had on the Okeechobee Center tenants.\n\nThe record is incomplete and issue has not been joined on this matter. We conclude, therefore, that the\n\ndistrict court erred in granting summary judgment sua sponte to Appellee BGHA on Appellants' action to\n\n\n\n   32\n     This claim is also governed by Florida's four-year residual personal injury statute of limitations. See\nRozar v. Mullis, 85 F.3d 556, 561 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that Title VI claims are governed by the same\nstatute of limitations applicable to § 1983 claims).\n\n                                                        35\n\fenforce the disparate impact regulations promulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI, and we remand this\n\nclaim to the district court to provide the parties with an opportunity to develop the record as to this distinct\n\nclaim.33\n\n                                                       III.\n\n           In sum, we hold that Appellants have failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact in support\n\nof their claims arising under § 1983, section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and section 601 of Title VI\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that the district court properly entered summary judgment as to each of\n\nthese claims. However, with respect to Appellants' claim arising under disparate impact regulations\n\npromulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI, we conclude that the district court improvidently granted\n\nsummary judgment to Appellee BGHA. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part,\n\nREVERSED in part, and REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n   33\n     Appellants also move this Court to reassign the case on remand to another judge. We can find no\nbasis in this record to do so, and, accordingly, deny this application.\n\n                                                       36\n\f",

(No. 95-8356-CV-KLR),\nKenneth L. Ryskamp, Judge.\n\nBefore TJOFLAT, BARKETT and MARCUS, Circuit Judges.\n\n        MARCUS, Circuit Judge:\n\n        Appellants, three African-American tenants of the Okeechobee Center, a housing project located in\n\nunincorporated Palm Beach County, and four African-American residents of the City of Belle Glade, brought\n\nthis lawsuit alleging that the City of Belle Glade unlawfully deprived them of their right to vote in failing to\n\nannex the Okeechobee Center into the City. Specifically, Appellants contend that the City failed to annex the\n\nhousing project for racial reasons in violation of the First, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments\n\nto the United States Constitution, section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964 and its implementing regulations. After extensive pre-trial proceedings, the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Appellees, the City of Belle Glade and others, on all counts, finding neither\n\na constitutional nor a statutory violation.\n\n        On appeal, Appellants challenge the district court's order on three basic grounds: first, the district\n\ncourt purportedly erred in concluding that Appellants failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nAppellees' discriminatory intent; second, the district court also erred in holding that the remedies they\n\nsought—including the unusual remedy of ordering a city to annex property into its municipal\n\nboundaries—were neither available under the Voting Rights Act nor permissible under the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure; and finally, the district court erred in granting summary judgment sua sponte to Appellees\n\fon Appellants' Title VI claims. After thoroughly reviewing the record and the parties' briefs, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgment concerning Appellants' constitutional and Voting Rights Act claims, as well as the\n\nTitle VI statutory claim, but reverse and remand Appellants' cause of action to enforce Title VI's disparate\n\nimpact regulations for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      I.\n\n        The historical facts and the procedural history necessary to understand this lawsuit are complex and\n\nextensive. At the core, however, this legal battle has been fought over the refusal of the City of Belle Glade\n\n(\"City\") to annex an adjacent housing project known as the Okeechobee Center Farmers' Home\n\nAdministration Project (\"Okeechobee Center\") into its geographic and municipal boundaries.\n\n        The City of Belle Glade is an incorporated municipality located on the western side of Palm Beach\n\nCounty, near Florida's agricultural heartland. In the 1930s, the federal government created two housing\n\nprojects outside the city limits. One of them, known as the Osceola Center, was populated by whites and\n\nstood at the City's northwest corner. The other, the Okeechobee Center, was populated by blacks and was\n\nlocated to the southwest of the City. In 1947, the City created the Belle Glade Housing Authority (\"BGHA\"),\n\na board of seven members nominated by the mayor and appointed by the City Commission, to address the\n\n\"shortage of safe sanitary dwelling accommodations in the City of Belle Glade available to persons of low\n\nincome at rentals they can afford.\" The BGHA assumed ownership and operation of both the Osceola and\n\nOkeechobee Centers. The centers, however, remain funded in part by the federal government through grants\n\nfrom the Department of Agriculture. \"Jim Crow\" laws required both housing projects to be segregated by\n\nrace.1 During this time, the City also mandated residential segregation. See, e.g., Belle Glade, Fla.,\n\n\n\n   1\n     In March 1975, however, a group of tenants brought suit in federal district court against the Secretary\nof Agriculture and various local housing authorities under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to\nintegrate the centers. See Mae Golden Acres Tenants' Ass'n v. Butz, No. 75-1161-CIV-JE (S.D.Fla.1975).\nOn July 19, 1977, the district court entered a stipulation for consent judgment in the Mae Golden Acres\nlitigation, which provided that the BGHA would no longer segregate the Osceola and Okeechobee\nCenters by race and would administer the projects according to racially non-discriminatory policies. This\nsettlement marked the formal end of de jure segregation at the Osceola and Okeechobee Centers.\n\n                                                      2\n\fOrdinance 45, 184, 273, 443 (Nov. 18, 1931, Sept. 18, 1936, January 12, 1938, December 27, 1939). These\n\nordinances were repealed, however, by 1963. See Belle Glade, Fla., Ordinance 63-11, § 1 (April 24, 1963)\n\n(repealing Belle Glade, Fla., Code §§ 26-14 to -17 (relating to zoning)).\n\n        In 1960, the total population of the City of Belle Glade was 11,273, of which 7,393 (65.6%) were\n\nnon-whites and 3,880 (34.4%) were whites.2 The following year, the City proposed, for the first time,\n\nextending its municipal boundaries by annexing both the Okeechobee and Osceola Centers. The City asked\n\nthe property owner, BGHA, whether it had any views on the matter. After discussing the possible advantages\n\nand disadvantages, the BGHA ultimately petitioned to the City only for annexation of the Osceola Center.\n\nSoon thereafter, on April 26, 1961, the City Commission considered the BGHA's petition and unanimously\n\nannexed the Osceola Center.\n\n        In the 1970s, the City and the BGHA twice considered the possibility of annexing the Okeechobee\n\nCenter. In 1971, the City Commission's minutes simply reflect that a meeting was to be arranged between\n\nthe City Commission and the BGHA to discuss the possibility of annexing the Okeechobee Center. The\n\nminutes make no mention, however, of who made the annexation request or whether any meeting was ever\n\nheld. Two years later, on February 26, 1973, a group of tenants from the Okeechobee Center asked the City\n\nCommission to annex the center. The City Commission advised the tenants that it would consider annexation\n\nif the BGHA made the request. On April 17, 1973, the tenants asked the BGHA to petition the City for\n\nannexation, but the BGHA denied their request in October 1973. The record does not reflect whether the\n\nBGHA offered any reason for denying the request.\n\n\n\n\n   2\n     As of 1970, the total population of Belle Glade increased to 15,949, of which the percentage of blacks\ndecreased to 52.9% while the percentage of whites increased to 46.5%. By 1993, a special census showed\nthat the City's total population had increased further to 17,208, the population of blacks increasing to\n54.8% and the white population decreasing to 39.6%. As of May 24, 1994, the population of the Osceola\nCenter was 46% black, 50% Hispanic, and 4% white, whereas the population of the Okeechobee Center\nwas 92% black and 8% Hispanic.\n\n                                                     3\n\f        The following year, the Florida legislature repealed all local laws pertaining to the adjustment of\n\nmunicipal boundaries and established a uniform legislative standard for use throughout the state. See\n\nMunicipal Annexation or Contraction Act, 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat.\n\nAnn. §§ 171.021-.022 (West 1987)). The statute specifically provided for the voluntary annexation of any\n\nproperty contiguous to a municipality upon petition by the property owner to the municipality's governing\n\nbody. See 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West\n\nSupp.1998)). The City Commission also could initiate annexation of any contiguous, compact, and\n\nunincorporated property by a referendum of the registered voters of the municipality and the residents of the\n\narea proposed to be annexed. See 1975 Fla. Laws ch. 75-297, § 2 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. §\n\n171.0413 (West.1987 & Supp.1998)). Notably, according to these provisions, the statute prohibited\n\nmunicipalities from annexing any property that did not meet the statute's definition of contiguity. See 1974\n\nFla. Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (codified as amended at Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.031(11) (West 1987)).3\n\n        Two attempts to secure the City's annexation of the Okeechobee Center through litigation occurred\n\nin 1980.4 Pursuant to a settlement agreement, the City and City Commission agreed to appoint an\n\n\"Annexation Committee\" to investigate and make recommendations concerning the wisdom and efficacy of\n\nannexing the Okeechobee Center.5 In November 1984, after the Committee held public hearings, received\n\n\n\n\n   3\n     The parties dispute whether the Okeechobee Center is contiguous to the City, and, hence, available\nfor annexation under Florida law. See discussion infra Part II.B.2.\n   4\n     In Okeechobee Center Cries for Help v. Belle Glade Housing Authority, No. 80-8220-CIV-JAG\n(S.D.Fla.1980), tenants of the Okeechobee Center sued the City and the BGHA seeking, inter alia, a\nmandatory injunction requiring the defendants to take all steps necessary to annex the Okeechobee Center\ninto Belle Glade. Similarly, in Jackson v. City of Belle Glade, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D.Fla.1982), some Belle\nGlade residents brought suit against the City and BGHA, seeking annexation of all black areas adjacent to\nthe City The parties eventually resolved both lawsuits prior to trial without the plaintiffs' obtaining\nannexation and, in March 1984, the court dismissed the suits with prejudice.\n   5\n    The City Commission appointed five members to this Committee: one member of the Okeechobee\nCenter Tenant's Association, one black resident of the City as recommended by the Panhellenic Council,\nand three additional members, at least one of whom had to be a member of a minority group.\n\n                                                     4\n\fcomments from the public, investigated and considered the possibilities and ramifications of annexation, and\n\nconducted a cost study of annexation, the Committee issued a report recommending against annexation on\n\nthe grounds that the Okeechobee Center did not satisfy Florida's statutory contiguity requirement and that\n\nannexation did not make reasonable economic sense for the City.6 However, the report also urged the City\n\nCommission to consider other factors \"relating to the humanitarian aspects of those residing in Okeechobee\n\nCenter\" in light of residents' feelings \"that annexation would right past 'wrongs.' \" On January 28, 1985, the\n\nCity Commission officially accepted the Annexation Committee's report.\n\n        As far as the record reflects, the tenants' efforts at annexing the Okeechobee Center lay dormant for\n\nover ten years, until May 8, 1995, when Albert Peterson, a resident of the Okeechobee Center and President\n\nof the Resident's Council of the Okeechobee and Osceola Centers, wrote Mayor Weeks requesting that the\n\nCity annex the Okeechobee Center. On May 30, 1995, the Mayor denied Peterson's request, concluding that\n\nannexation would be \"neither feasible nor advantageous to the City from the financial and public services\n\nperspective.\" The Mayor's letter summarized the findings of \"[a] study of this issue that was done a number\n\nof years ago\":\n\n                Upon annexation, the City must provide the following municipal services: water, sewer,\n        police protection, sanitation services, street lighting, street signs, street paving, maintenance,\n        drainage, parks and recreation. Since the subject land is exempt from ad valorem taxes, no property\n        taxes would be generated to offset the cost of providing the necessary services, which far outweigh\n        any miscellaneous revenues that might be realized.\n\n               Other factors in determining the viability of annexing the parcel included the following: 1)\n        No need exists to expand into the proposed parcel, 2) No industry would be annexed, 3) The parcel\n        would provide no additional facilities to be brought into the City, 4) Annexation would not improve\n        the economy of the City, and 5) The Comprehensive Plan would have to be revised thereby\n        compounding the expense to the City.\n\n\n\n\n   6\n    Specifically, the report estimated the following capital outlay and first year start-up costs: library\nservices, $158,693; inspection, $8,000; fire, $442,000; streets $7,140; building and grounds, $18,640;\ngarbage collection, $138,483; police, $133,724; and parks and recreation, $119, 556. Thus, the total\nestimated costs were $1,026,236. The report further estimated that the property would generate\nmiscellaneous revenues for the City of $126,000 per year.\n\n                                                      5\n\f               City Attorney John Baker's legal opinion was that the City may not annex the property\n        known as the Okeechobee Center because the said property is not contiguous to the municipal\n        boundaries, and annexation is therefore prohibited by Florida statutes.\n\nBecause \"costs have risen, conditions have not changed, and the laws have not been amended\" since that\n\nstudy was conducted, the Mayor concluded that he would not propose annexation of the Okeechobee Center.\n\n        On June 12, 1995, four tenants of the Okeechobee Center7 and four black residents of the City\n\ninitiated this lawsuit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the City of Belle Glade, the Mayor of\n\nBelle Glade, the Belle Glade City Commission and its members, and the BGHA and its officers and members\n\nalleging that the BGHA's failure to petition for annexation and the City's failure to annex the Okeechobee\n\nCenter, as well as the City's practice of annexing property populated by whites, denied or abridged the rights\n\nof Appellants to vote on account of race or color in violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1994), and that these practices were adopted or purposefully maintained to dilute the\n\nvoting strength of Appellants and deprive them of their rights secured by the First, Thirteenth, Fourteenth,\n\nand Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1994 &\n\nSupp. II 1996). Appellants further alleged that the BGHA's failure to petition for annexation discriminated\n\nagainst the tenants of the Okeechobee Center on the basis of race, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d to 2000d-4a (1994), and its implementing regulations, 7 C.F.R. § 15.3\n\n(1999). The district court dismissed Appellants' claims to the extent that they relied on the First and\n\nThirteenth Amendments, expressed its view that the remedy of forced annexation was not available under\n\nsection 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and dismissed Appellants' constitutional claims without prejudice for\n\nfailure to plead pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Appellants subsequently filed an amended complaint.\n\n        Prior to trial, each side moved for summary judgment. The City filed a motion on Appellants' claims\n\nunder section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, arguing that because the Okeechobee Center did not satisfy the\n\n\n\n\n   7\n    On March 24, 1997, the district court granted Okeechobee tenant Charles Jackson's motion to\nwithdraw as plaintiff. Three tenants remain in the suit.\n\n                                                      6\n\fstatutory requirements for annexation set forth in Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West Supp.1998), Appellants\n\nhad no available remedy. Appellants, in turn, moved for summary judgment on their constitutional claims.\n\nOn May 20, 1997, the district court granted summary judgment for Appellees on both the constitutional and\n\nVoting Rights Act claims. The court also granted summary judgment sua sponte for the BGHA on the\n\nremaining Title VI claims. Specifically, the district court held that because the Okeechobee Center was not\n\n\"contiguous\" to the City of Belle Glade, Florida law prohibited its annexation; that race discrimination did\n\nnot cause the City's refusal to annex the Okeechobee Center; that judicially-compelled annexation was not\n\nan available remedy under the Voting Rights Act; that an injunction prohibiting the City from discriminating\n\nin future annexation decisions was not sufficiently specific to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n65(d); and, lastly, that there was no meaningful relief available for Appellants' Title VI claim because, even\n\nif the district court ordered the BGHA to petition for annexation, Florida law still prohibited the City from\n\ngranting the request.

The governing standard is by now well understood.\n\nSummary judgment is proper if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). As we have explained:\n\n        In assessing whether the movant has met this burden, the courts should view the evidence and all\n        factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. All\n        reasonable doubts about the facts should be resolved in favor of the non-movant. If the record\n        presents factual issues, the court must not decide them; it must deny the motion and proceed to trial.\n        Summary judgment may be inappropriate even where the parties agree on the basic facts, but disagree\n        about the inferences that should be drawn from these facts. If reasonable minds might differ on the\n        inferences arising from undisputed facts, then the court should deny summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fClemons v.

We observe at the\noutset, however, that in a very real sense these claims are distinct. The Okeechobee Center tenants'\nclaimed injury stems from an allegedly improper racial motive in Appellees' annexation decisions\nconcerning the Okeechobee Center. These allegations give rise to a traditional race discrimination claim\nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and a vote denial claim under the\nFifteenth Amendment. In contrast, we construe the citizens of Belle Glade to complain that the BGHA\nand the City purposefully employed discriminatory practices to dilute the voting strength of black citizens\nwithin the City's boundaries. These discriminatory practices, if proved, allegedly injured Belle Glade\ncitizens because they enjoyed the right to vote in Belle Glade. Because the Okeechobee Center tenants\nnever possessed a right to vote within the City, Appellants' constitutional vote dilution claim may only be\npremised on the injuries of the Belle Glade citizens.

Specifically, Appellants assert that the four-year statute of limitations\nshould not operate to exclude relevant historical evidence of past discriminatory practices. To the extent\nthe district court suggested that it would exclude evidence of discrimination that preceded the 1995 act at\nissue—the only act occurring within the limitations period—we believe that the district court erred. See\nCity of Dothan, 745 F.2d at 1415-16 (holding that district court erred in excluding evidence of municipal\ndecisions that occurred outside the statute of limitations period on ground that evidence was relevant to\nissue of defendant's later discriminatory intent). However, because the district court did, in fact, consider\nall of Appellants' evidence, see Burton, 966 F.Supp. at 1182, and because an examination of all of the\nproffered evidence does not alter the result, any error plainly would be harmless.\n\n                                                       11\n\fAppellants assert that since there was direct evidence of a de jure racial classification in Belle Glade housing\n\nbefore 1977, any inquiry into Appellees' discriminatory intent is unnecessary; second, they suggest that the\n\nbizarre shape of the City's municipal boundaries is circumstantial evidence of improper racial motive under\n\nShaw v.

Taken together, they argue, these categories of evidence raise a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to whether race was a substantial or motivating factor in the City's 1995 decision to refuse annexation\n\nof the Okeechobee Center. We are not persuaded by Appellants' arguments either standing alone or in\n\nconcert, but consider each in turn.\n\n                                                       1.\n\n                                        De Jure Racial Classification\n\n        Appellants first argue that the City's annexation of the Osceola Center constituted the enforcement\n\nof a de jure racial classification. Because Belle Glade ordinances required racial segregation in residential\n\nhousing, Appellants contend that the City's annexation of the Osceola Center back in 1961 constituted the\n\nenforcement of a de jure racial classification. Appellants, therefore, assert that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to engage in the stringent review required for cases involving prior de jure segregation. This claim\n\nis unavailing.\n\n         The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to prohibit states\n\nfrom discriminating against individuals on the basis of race.

In the first place, Appellants can point to no\n\ncourt that has ever applied Fordice outside of the education setting. Indeed, given the unique nature of school\n\ndesegregation, we hesitate to extend Fordice to a property annexation case. But even if we assume,\n\narguendo, that the analysis applies, Appellants have failed to demonstrate that the City's 1995 annexation\n\ndecision is, in any way, \"traceable\" to or \"rooted\" in past de jure segregation. Knight, 14 F.3d at 1540-41\n\n(noting that plaintiff has burden of proof to show that challenged policy is \"traceable\" to past segregation).\n\nThe City's 1961 decision to annex the Osceola Center, the white housing project, and the concomitant\n\n\"determination\" not to annex the Okeechobee Center, the black housing project, when the BGHA only\n\npetitioned for Osceola's annexation, neither created a racial classification nor enforced the City's segregation\n\nlaws. Although the two centers were segregated by race in 1961, on this record there is simply no evidence\n\nthat residential segregation laws dictated which center the City annexed, or, indeed, that race played any role\n\nin the process. Moreover, there is no evidence that the City had any policy, either in 1961 or later, of making\n\nannexation decisions on the basis of the race of the residents in the proposed annexation areas. It is even\n\nunclear on this record that the City ever entertained a request to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1961, or,\n\nfor that matter, that the Okeechobee Center was similarly situated to the Osceola Center, let alone evidence\n\nshowing that the decision to annex the Osceola Center was somehow based on the race of its occupants.\n\nNondiscriminatory reasons were offered to explain the Osceola annexation—including evidence that the\n\nBGHA requested annexation to provide City police protection to the residents due to ongoing threats against\n\n\n\n                                                        13\n\fthe center's manager—and Appellants have presented nothing to rebut this. While it is undeniably true that\n\nthe two centers were segregated by race in 1961, Appellants notably have been unable to draw some\n\nconnection between that de jure policy and the decision to annex the Osceola Center. Accordingly, we cannot\n\nfind that the City enforced any policy of racial classification in its annexation decisions. Absent such\n\nevidence, the district court did not err in refusing to require Appellees to present evidence of their efforts to\n\nremedy prior de jure segregation.\n\n        The very most Appellants could argue is that the existence of the City's segregation ordinances may\n\nhave raised an inference of discriminatory intent back in 1961. The existence of these ordinances, however,\n\nwhich were abolished more than twenty years before the 1995 decision, can in no way transform this cause\n\nof action into a challenge to the enforcement of a racial classification or de jure segregation.\n\n                                                       2.\n\n                                            Municipal Boundaries\n\n        Appellants also suggest that the municipal boundaries of the City of Belle Glade are so bizarre as to\n\nraise an inference of racially discriminatory intent under the racial gerrymandering case of Shaw v.

Appellants assert that the City's decision to annex State\n\nRoad Number 80 in 1965 and its deliberate decision not to annex the black population centers on either side\n\nof the highway, rendered the boundaries of Belle Glade bizarre. They argue, therefore, that this annexation\n\nis facially suspect and triggers strict scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the district court\n\nagain erred in failing to shift the burden to Appellees to produce evidence that the municipal boundary was\n\nshaped by decisions that were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. We find this\n\nargument similarly unpersuasive.\n\n         To establish that a districting scheme amounts to impermissible racial gerrymandering, a plaintiff\n\nbears the burden of proving that race was the predominant factor in the legislature's decision either through\n\n\" 'circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics' or through 'more direct evidence going to\n\n\n\n                                                       14\n\flegislative purpose.' \" Shaw v.

In sharp contrast, however, is a city's right to determine if and when it will expand its municipal\n\nboundaries. Although the City of Belle Glade may well be bizarrely shaped, its contours were created over\n\nan extended time period as hundreds of individual parcels were brought into its ambit incrementally; it was\n\nnot created by a single scheme designed to exclude property on the basis of race. Cf. Chen v. City of Houston,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2387333\"><a href=\"/opinion/2387333/chen-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Moreover, not surprisingly, Appellants have been unable to show that the\n\nannexation of any specific piece of property, including the Okeechobee Center, would make the shape of the\n\nCity of Belle Glade any less \"bizarre.\"\n\n         The central problem with Appellants' argument is that the City's shape has not been shown to have\n\nbeen created because of any affirmative annexation plan. Rather, the City's pattern of annexation over time\n\nmerely reflects the aggregation of various owners' requests for annexation, which the City generally approves\n\nso long as the proposed annexations satisfies the obligations of Florida law, and annexations initiated solely\n\nby the City, which also must conform to Florida law and which City voters and annex residents must approve\n\nby referendum. See Fla. Stat. Ann. §§ 171.044(1), 171.0413. Absent some other evidence, such as the\n\ncircumstances surrounding a multitude of other annexation decisions, the specific racial composition of each\n\nof these areas, whether the unincorporated areas ever requested annexation, or perhaps some comparison of\n\nthe shapes of other Florida municipalities, we cannot find that the municipal boundaries alone raise an\n\ninference of the City's racially discriminatory intent. Thus, whether or not a Shaw analysis could apply in\n\nthe context of municipal property annexation, the simple fact is that this record is wholly insufficient to raise\n\na genuine issue of material fact to support a distinct claim under Shaw.\n\n                                                       3.\n\n                                 Circumstantial Evidence of Discrimination\n\n\n\n                                                       16\n\f        Finally, Appellants claim that the circumstantial evidence, when weighed together, establishes the\n\nCity's discriminatory motive or intent in refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1995. Indeed,\n\nAppellants argue that the City's annexation decisions cannot be explained in non-racial terms. Appellants,\n\ntherefore, contend that the district court erred in concluding that they failed to raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether race was a substantial or motivating factor behind the City's 1995 decision to\n\nrefuse annexation of the Okeechobee Center.

Appellants are incorrect on both counts.\n\n        Turning to the circumstantial evidence surrounding the 1995 decision, Appellants contend that two\n\nadditional pieces of evidence establish the City's discriminatory purpose. Appellants argue that the City's\n\njustification of costs in refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center raises an inference of race discrimination\n\nbecause the City does not usually consider costs when deciding whether to annex property. Appellants also\n\nassert that the City's view that Florida law prohibited annexation of the Okeechobee Center was a mere\n\npretext for the City's discriminatory purpose. Neither argument raises an inference of discriminatory intent.\n\n         First, the City's reliance on cost as a justification for refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center in\n\n1995 does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the City's allegedly improper racial motive.\n\nAppellants have offered no evidence to support their contention that the City does not usually consider cost\n\nin making annexation decisions. However, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that some disparity exists,\n\nwe fail to see how reliance on cost here raises an inference of race animus. As the Annexation Committee\n\nfound back in 1984, providing the necessary municipal services to the Okeechobee Center would be a very\n\nexpensive proposition for the City of Belle Glade. Moreover, because the property is exempt from ad\n\nvalorem taxes, the City would enjoy little revenue to offset this expense. Thus, the City's reliance on costs\n\nwas altogether reasonable under the circumstances. Indeed, a Florida municipality has an obligation to its\n\n\n\n                                                       17\n\fcitizens to consider the economic impact of annexations.13 Therefore, we decline to accept Appellants'\n\nsuggestion that the City's reliance on cost was a pretext for race discrimination.\n\n          Second, the City's conclusion that Florida law prohibited annexation of the Okeechobee center does\n\nnot raise an inference of race discrimination. The parties do not dispute that the Okeechobee Center could\n\nonly be annexed if contiguous to the City, and that its contiguity would arise only from its proximity to State\n\nRoad Number 80, which the City annexed in 1965. Therefore, Okeechobee's contiguity turns on whether a\n\nmunicipality may use a previously annexed road to gain contiguity to otherwise non-contiguous property.\n\nFlorida law, however, is hotly disputed and far from settled on this question.\n\n           Since 1974, Florida law has provided that an owner of reasonably compact14 property that is\n\ncontiguous15 to a municipality may petition for annexation. See Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.044(1) (West\n\n\n   13\n        Section 171.021 provides:\n\n                            The purposes of this act are to set forth procedures for adjusting the boundaries\n                  of municipalities through annexations or contractions or corporate limits and to set forth\n                  criteria for determining when annexations or contractions may take place so as to:\n\n                          (1) Insure sound urban development and accommodation to growth.\n\n                         (2) Establish uniform legislative standards throughout the state for the adjustment\n                  of municipal boundaries.\n\n                          (3) Insure the efficient provision of urban services to areas that become urban in\n                  character.\n\n                          (4) Insure that areas are not annexed unless municipal services can be provided to\n                  those areas.\n\n          Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.021.\n   14\n     \" 'Compactness' means concentration of a piece of property in a single area and precludes any action\nwhich would create enclaves, pockets, or finger areas in serpentine patterns.

Ann. § 171.031(12).\n   15\n     \" 'Contiguous' means that a substantial part of a boundary of the territory sought to be annexed by\nthe municipality is coterminous with a part of the boundary of the municipality....

In 1977, the Florida Attorney General considered whether Florida law permitted a municipality\n\nto annex property only contiguous to the municipality by virtue of a previously annexed road.16 See 1977 Fla.\n\nOp. Atty. Gen. 35. Recognizing that no Florida appellate court had considered the issue, the Attorney\n\nGeneral concluded that a parcel may not be voluntarily annexed if it is only contiguous to the City by virtue\n\nof a previously annexed highway because such annexation would violate both Florida's contiguity\n\nrequirement and its prohibition against the creation of enclaves. See id. Then, in 1985, the Attorney General\n\nconsidered whether a municipality could voluntarily annex property contiguous on one side to a previously\n\nannexed, 125 foot-wide corridor of unimproved land, but otherwise surrounded by unincorporated property.\n\nSee 1985 Fla. Op. Atty. Gen. 163. Although concluding that the city could not voluntarily annex the parcel\n\nbecause it would result in the creation of a prohibited enclave, the Attorney General found that Florida's\n\ncontiguity requirement would not prohibit the municipality from using the corridor of unimproved land to\n\ngain contiguity because the statute did not apply to property annexed before 1974. Id. The Attorney General,\n\nhowever, never reconciled his finding of contiguity in the 1985 opinion with the conclusion he had reached\n\neight years earlier.\n\n        Based on this undeniably conflicting authority, we conclude that the City's reliance on the 1974\n\nannexation statute as a justification for the denial of Peterson's request to annex the Okeechobee Center does\n\n\n\nentities to be annexed in a corridor fashion to gain contiguity....\" Fla. Stat. Ann. § 171.031(11).\n\n                 Prior to 1975, section 171.031(11) stated, in relevant part: \"Local rights-of-way, utility\n        easements, or railroad rights-of-way shall not be annexed in a corridor fashion to gain contiguity\n        nor shall such activity be deemed to establish the contiguity required under this act.\" 1974 Fla.\n        Laws ch. 74-190, § 1 (emphasis added). Since the underscored language was deleted in 1975, see\n        1975 Fla. Laws ch. 75-297, Appellants contend that the statute only prohibits annexation of roads\n        to gain contiguity, but it does not bar annexation of property contiguous to a previously annexed\n        road. Even assuming, arguendo, that Appellants' statutory interpretation is correct—and we have\n        no need to resolve this question of Florida law today—the amended language does not establish\n        that the City's statutory interpretation was unreasonable.\n   16\n     Although Florida Opinions of the Attorney General are not binding on this Court, they \"are entitled\nto careful consideration and generally should be regarded as highly persuasive\" of matters of Florida law.\nState v.

Even if we were to\n\ndetermine today that Florida law permits annexation—and the law is anything but clear as to this matter—we\n\nwould still conclude that the City's interpretation was an altogether reasonable one given the plainly\n\nconflicting Attorney General opinions.17 In short, the City's reliance on the 1974 annexation statute cannot\n\nfairly be taken as being a pretext for race discrimination.\n\n         The only other evidence presented by Appellants relates to the historical background to the City's\n\n1995 decision. However, \"the historical background for a given decision is only one factor relative to intent.\n\nIt does not, by itself, compel [a court] to find a discriminatory purpose behind every statute passed during\n\nregrettable periods of [a state's] past.\" Hall v.

Nevertheless,\n\nAppellants point to three pieces of historical evidence. First, the City's housing ordinances mandated\n\nresidential segregation until 1963. Second, the Osceola and Okeechobee Centers were segregated by race\n\nuntil 1977. Lastly, the BGHA failed to petition the Okeechobee Center in 1961 and 1973 and the City failed\n\nto annex in 1961, 1971, and 1985. This evidence is far too remote and attenuated to be probative of any\n\ndiscriminatory purpose in 1995. Simply put, we fail to see how evidence of past residential segregation in\n\nhousing, which ended almost twenty years before the decision at issue, and which is wholly unconnected to\n\nany annexation decision, or a prior refusal to annex standing alone establishes any intent, let alone a\n\ndiscriminatory one, in 1995.

No jury could reasonably find\n\nfor Appellants based on this record. In the first place, the City's reliance on cost—a possible expense to the\n\nCity of close to one million dollars—was an altogether reasonable basis on which to refuse annexation.\n\nSecond, the City's reliance on Florida's contiguity requirement to deny annexation was likewise reasonable\n\ngiven the conflicting authority in Florida law, and in no way supports an inference of pretext for race\n\ndiscrimination. Lastly, Appellants' historical evidence, which at most arguably raised an inference of the\n\nCity's discriminatory intent in the 1960s and 1970s, offers no plausible connection between any conceivable\n\ndiscriminatory intent rooted in the past and the 1995 act at issue today.

Rather, the district court granted\n\nAppellees' motion for summary judgment explaining that mandatory annexation is not an available remedy\n\nunder the Voting Rights Act. The district court also considered each of the required factors in a vote dilution\n\nclaim, see infra II.B.2, and concluded that it doubted whether Appellants had even made a prima facie\n\nshowing under section 2. See Burton, 966 F.Supp. at 1186 n. 10. After thoroughly searching this record, we\n\nlikewise conclude that Appellants have failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to either vote\n\ndenial or vote dilution under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.22 On the record presented, we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that court-ordered annexation is not an appropriate remedy to redress either of Appellants'\n\nalleged injuries—vote denial or vote dilution.23\n\n                                                        1.\n\n                                                  Vote Denial\n\n\n\n\n   21\n     Appellants' vote dilution claim, we believe, may be premised only upon the claimed injuries of Belle\nGlade's black citizens. This is true because only those who enjoy the right to vote in Belle Glade may\nhave their voting strength diluted by the City's annexation decisions. In contrast, Appellants' vote denial\nclaim may only arise from injuries of black tenants of the Okeechobee Center. See supra note 8.\n   22\n     We need not reach the question of whether a challenge to a city's failure to annex adjacent property\nis cognizable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In Perkins v.

As we explained in Nipper:\n\n        The inquiries into remedy and liability ... cannot be separated: A district court must determine as part\n        of the Gingles threshold inquiry whether it can fashion a permissible remedy in the particular context\n        of the challenged system.\n\n        ....\n\n        ... The absence of an available remedy is not only relevant at the remedial stage of the litigation but\n        also precludes, under the totality of the circumstances inquiry, a finding of liability.\n\n39 F.3d at 1530-31, 1533. Accordingly, the failure to establish the first Gingles factor—the availability of\n\na remedy—is fatal to a plaintiff's section 2 claim.\n\n        Appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that court-ordered annexation and an\n\ninjunction against future discrimination in annexation decisions are not available remedies under the Voting\n\nRights Act. We disagree. Specifically, Appellants prayed for two different forms of relief to redress their\n\nsection 2 claims: an order requiring Belle Glade \"to take all steps necessary to effectuate the annexation of\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fthe Okeechobee Center\" into Belle Glade, and an injunction prohibiting Belle Glade \"from enforcing any and\n\nall racially discriminatory policy(ies) in their decisions as to which parcels of land to annex.\"25 Neither of\n\nthese remedies are appropriate.\n\n         Court-ordered annexation is a remedy of unprecedented scope and magnitude. Indeed, we are not\n\nsurprised that Appellants cannot point to a single case, nor have we been able to find one, that has ordered\n\nso unusual a remedy. For it is one thing for a court sitting in equity to proscribe policymakers from\n\nemploying unambiguously racial bases for decision-making and to order government entities to make\n\nannexation decisions on race-neutral grounds, but it is quite another to force a municipality to expand its\n\nphysical boundaries by annexation. Moreover, courtordered annexation would bypass an inherently complex\n\npolitical process. A municipality's decision when and where to annex unincorporated property requires a\n\nseries of carefully-calibrated political and economic judgments. For example, a municipality undoubtedly\n\nmust consider whether the property is reasonably compact and contiguous to the municipality, whether it\n\ncontains a sufficient financial base, whether annexation will require a substantial increase in municipal\n\nservices, and whether annexation will confer any non-pecuniary benefits to the municipality. Only after\n\nmeasured evaluation of these and other factors would a municipality elect to proceed with annexation. In\n\nstark contrast, court-ordered annexation circumvents this political process, and may result in numerous\n\nunintended adverse consequences.26\n\n\n\n\n   25\n    Notably, Appellants have not sought the wholly impracticable remedy of deannexing the Osceola\nCenter, after close to forty years of Belle Glade citizenship.\n   26\n      Moreover, to the extent court-ordered annexation would require the municipality to raise taxes in\norder to absorb the new property, the remedy would run up against Supreme Court precedent in school\ndesegregation cases. In such cases, the Supreme Court has held that court-ordered tax increases\ncontravene \"the principles of comity that must govern the exercise of the District Court's equitable\ndiscretion.\" Missouri v.

A court is incapable of enforcing so broad and vague\n\nan injunction.\n\n        Appellants seek to enjoin the City from discriminating on the basis of race in its annexation decisions.\n\nAs this injunction would do no more than instruct the City to \"obey the law,\" we believe that it would not\n\nsatisfy the specificity requirements of Rule 65(d) and that it would be incapable of enforcement. See Payne,\n\n565 F.2d at 898. In short, an injunction prohibiting the City from discriminating against the Okeechobee\n\nCenter in future annexation decisions is not an available remedy to redress Appellants' alleged injuries.\n\n         On this record, Appellants have not established a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence\n\nof an appropriate remedy sufficient to satisfy the first Gingles prerequisite.

Appellant's have similarly failed to establish a genuine issue\n\nof material fact as to either of these elements. The second factor requires a showing that the minority group\n\nis politically cohesive, while the third demands proof of a majority white voting bloc sufficient to defeat the\n\nminority's preferred candidates.

In other words, \"[p]roof\n\nof the second and third Gingles factors ... is circumstantial evidence of racial bias operating through the\n\nelectoral system to deny minority voters equal access to the political process.\" Nipper, 39 F.3d at 1524.

See id. at 1524-25.\n\n        Here, Appellants have offered no evidence of political cohesion or a majority white voting bloc.\n\nIndeed, as discussed earlier, Appellants' only evidence concerns allegations of Appellees' discriminatory\n\nintent. This evidence is wholly insufficient to meet the requirements of the Gingles factors. Given the dearth\n\nof relevant evidence as to Appellants' section 2 vote dilution claim, Appellants have failed to establish a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact concerning the second or third prerequisite under Gingles.

First, they assert that the BGHA\n\nintentionally discriminated against the tenants of the Okeechobee Center on the basis of race in violation of\n\nsection 601 of Title VI by refusing to petition for annexation. Second, Appellants allege that the BGHA's\n\nfailure to petition resulted in discriminatory effects on the basis of race in violation of the disparate impact\n\nregulations promulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI. The district court granted the BGHA summary\n\njudgment sua sponte on both of these claims, specifically concluding that no meaningful relief could be\n\nfashioned to remedy the alleged wrong. Appellants contend that this decision was error. Even if the district\n\ncourt were correct that it could not order annexation, Appellants argue that the court could have ordered the\n\n\n\n   30\n        The Department of Agriculture has promulgated the following regulations relevant to this litigation:\n\n                            (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other\n                   benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of\n                   individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other\n                   benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program or the class of individuals\n                   to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or\n                   through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration\n                   which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race,\n                   color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing\n                   accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals of a particular\n                   race, color, or national origin.\n\n                           (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, an applicant or recipient may\n                   not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying\n                   them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any of its activities or\n                   programs to which the regulations in this part apply, on the grounds of race, color, or\n                   national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the\n                   accomplishment of the objectives of the Act and the regulations in this part.\n\n           7 C.F.R. § 15.3(b)(2), (3).\n\n                                                        33\n\fBGHA to equalize the benefits and services between the two centers.

But so long as the party against whom judgment will be entered is given\n\nsufficient advance notice and has been afforded an adequate opportunity to demonstrate why summary\n\njudgment should not be granted, then granting summary judgment sua sponte is entirely appropriate. See 10A\n\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2720 (3d\n\ned.1998).\n\n\n\n\n   31\n     Contrary to the district court's suggestion that Appellants' Title VI claims were properly presented on\nmotion, we believe that the district court entered summary judgment as to these claims sua sponte. See\nBurton, 966 F.Supp. at 1187 n. 11. The City only moved for summary judgment on Appellants' Voting\nRights Act claims on the ground that, as a matter of law, it could not be compelled to annex the\nOkeechobee Center. The district court concluded that the unavailability of the equitable remedy of\ncompelled annexation barred all of Appellants' claims. However, because the unavailability of\ncourt-ordered annexation is not dispositive of Appellants' Title VI claims against the BGHA, we cannot\nsay that any party had, in fact, moved for summary judgment on the Title VI claims.\n\n                                                      34\n\f         Appellants could survive summary judgment on their claim arising under section 601 only if they\n\nestablish a genuine issue of material fact as to the BGHA's discriminatory intent after June 13, 1991, four\n\nyears prior to the initiation of this lawsuit.32 Appellants' § 1983 claims also required proof of discriminatory\n\nintent during that same period. However, because Appellants themselves moved for summary judgment on\n\ntheir § 1983 claims, it follows that they, in fact, had more than reasonable opportunity to marshal the same\n\nevidence of intent in support of their Title VI claim as well. And since Appellants plainly failed to adduce\n\nsufficient evidence as to intent with respect to any portion of their § 1983 claims, it likewise follows a fortiori\n\nthat they could not present sufficient evidence of intent as to this Title VI claim either. Thus, the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment sua sponte to the BGHA as to Appellants' section 601 claim.\n\n         In contrast, Appellants were not afforded sufficient opportunity to defend against summary judgment\n\nwith respect to their cause of action to enforce the disparate impact regulations promulgated under section\n\n602 of Title VI. To survive summary judgment, in this context, Appellants must establish, among other\n\nthings, a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the BGHA's failure to petition for annexation of the\n\nOkeechobee Center resulted in a disparate impact on the Okeechobee Center tenants on the basis of race. See\n\nElston, 997 F.2d at 1407. Appellants simply did not have an opportunity to develop or marshal this type of\n\nevidence. As we have observed, Appellants' § 1983 claims turned on evidence of the City's discriminatory\n\nintent in refusing to annex the Okeechobee Center in 1995. Moreover, Appellants' claims under the Voting\n\nRights Act required evidence of an available remedy—court-ordered annexation or an injunction prohibiting\n\nthe City from discriminating on the basis of race. But the evidence required to establish these claims is not\n\ndispositive of any disparate impact the BGHA's actions may have had on the Okeechobee Center tenants.\n\nThe record is incomplete and issue has not been joined on this matter. We conclude, therefore, that the\n\ndistrict court erred in granting summary judgment sua sponte to Appellee BGHA on Appellants' action to\n\n\n\n   32\n     This claim is also governed by Florida's four-year residual personal injury statute of limitations.

However, with respect to Appellants' claim arising under disparate impact regulations\n\npromulgated pursuant to section 602 of Title VI, we conclude that the district court improvidently granted\n\nsummary judgment to Appellee BGHA.
