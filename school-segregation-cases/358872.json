The\ndistrict court concluded that SFSD’s policy did not violate\nTitle VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination because it fell\nwithin the statute’s “bona fide occupational qualification”\nexception, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(e)(1). We reverse the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to the County on the sex\ndiscrimination claims and vacate the denial of summary\njudgment to plaintiffs on those claims.\n\nI. Facts and Procedural History\n\n    In October 2006, SFSD implemented a new policy\nprohibiting male deputies from supervising female inmates in\nthe housing units of the jails operated by the County (the\n“Policy”). Single-sex staffing policies in correctional\n\f6     ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nfacilities are not new, and we have considered before whether\nsuch polices violate Title VII by impermissibly\ndiscriminating on the basis of sex. See Breiner v. Nevada\nDep’t of Corr., 610 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding policy\nviolated Title VII); Robino v. Iranon, 145 F.3d 1109 (9th Cir.\n1998) (per curiam) (holding policy did not violate Title VII).\n\n     The adoption of the Policy coincided with SFSD’s plan to\nconsolidate all of its female inmates within a single facility,\nCounty Jail 8 (“CJ8”). CJ8 has a “direct supervision” design,\nmeaning that its housing units, or “pods,” are composed of\ncells or sleeping bays arrayed around a central congregation\nspace. Each pod has two tiers and between 56 and 88 beds.\nAt the center of the pod is a podium from which a deputy can\nsee into common areas and into the cells and sleeping bays.\nEach pod is staffed by two deputies, one of whom remains at\nthe podium while the other makes rounds. Female inmates\nfill some, but not all, of the available housing pods in CJ8.\nEven though CJ8 is not single-sex, all of its pods are single-\nsex. This is consistent with SFSD’s long-standing practice of\nsegregating female and male inmates.\n\n    Although housing pods are single-sex, CJ8’s pod for\ninmates receiving medical or psychiatric care is not sex-\nsegregated. Male deputies are not permitted under the Policy\nto work with female inmates in the housing pods; however,\nmale deputies may be assigned to the mixed-sex medical pod\nor assigned to transport female inmates between CJ8 and\nother locations. Male deputies may also enter female housing\npods in some circumstances, such as to assist with feeding\nfemale inmates.\n\f        ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO            7\n\n    According to San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessey\n(the “Sheriff”), who had held his position since 1980,1 he\nadopted the Policy for four reasons: (1) to protect the safety\nof female inmates from sexual misconduct perpetrated by\nmale deputies, (2) to maintain the security of the jail in the\nface of female inmates’ ability to manipulate male deputies\nand of the deputies’ fear of false allegations of sexual\nmisconduct by the inmates, (3) to protect the privacy of\nfemale inmates, and (4) to promote the successful\nrehabilitation of female inmates.\n\n    Of the four reasons the Sheriff claims led him to enact the\nPolicy, he identified protecting the safety of inmates from\nsexual misconduct as the most important. As the County\npointed out, between 2001 and 2009, SFSD investigated\ntwelve complaints of sexual misconduct or inappropriate\nsexual relationships between a male deputy and a female\ninmate. Ten of those incidents occurred before the Policy\nwas implemented in 2006, and two occurred after. Notably,\nfour of the twelve incidents occurred in 2005, the year\nimmediately preceding the implementation of the Policy.\nSFSD sustained the allegations of misconduct and disciplined\ndeputies in two of the incidents: a 2001 incident in which a\nmale deputy had an inappropriate relationship with a female\ninmate with the intent to “cultivate a sexual relationship” and\na 2007 incident, after the Policy had been adopted, in which\na male deputy was present during a female inmate’s strip\nsearch. Three additional investigations were followed by a\ndeputy’s resignation; these concerned inappropriate contact\nor sex acts. SFSD also faced lawsuits in 2000 and 2005\nalleging that male deputies had engaged in unlawful sexual\nmisconduct with female inmates.\n\n 1\n     Sheriff Hennessey no longer holds this office.\n\f8       ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\n    With this concern for inmate safety in mind, the Sheriff\nasserts that he considered three responses, apart from\nenacting the Policy, to the problem of protecting female\ninmates from sexual misconduct: (1) implementing additional\nscreening of male deputies to determine whether they were\nlikely to engage in sexual misconduct with female inmates,\n(2) installing additional surveillance cameras to monitor\nactivities in CJ8’s housing pods, and (3) providing additional\ntraining to deputies. However, he claims to have rejected\neach of these alternatives as ineffective or unfeasible, so he\nproceeded to implement the Policy.\n\n    In July 2007, 35 deputies – a majority of whom were\nfemale – filed suit against the County, alleging that the policy\nconstituted sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(a), and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act\n(“FEHA”), Cal. Gov. Code § 12940. Title VII and FEHA\nboth make it “unlawful, with narrow exceptions, ‘to fail or\nrefuse to hire . . . any individual, or otherwise to discriminate\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of\nsuch individual’s . . . sex.’” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1207\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)).2 Plaintiffs claimed that\nthe Policy directly caused them a variety of harms related to\nthe conditions of their employment. For example, they\nclaimed that staffing restrictions caused by the Policy resulted\nin loss of control over when overtime was available or\nrequired, loss of opportunities to develop career-enhancing\nexperience, and loss of preferred shifts and regular days off\n\n\n    2\n   Because FEHA is interpreted consistently with Title VII, see Guz v.\nBechtel Nat’l Inc., 8 P.3d 1089 (Cal. 2000), we conduct our analysis of\nboth federal and state claims according to Title VII case law.\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO                  9\n\npreviously earned by seniority. Plaintiffs made additional\nclaims based on their sex discrimination claims: for unlawful\nemployment restrictions under Title VII and FEHA and for\nfailure to prevent a violation of FEHA.\n\n    In response, the County first argued that any harm\nsuffered by plaintiffs as a result of the Policy was exceedingly\nminor, or de minimis, and so was not actionable. Although it\ndid not dispute that the Policy discriminates against deputies\non the basis of sex, the County further argued that the\ndiscrimination that resulted from the Policy was permissible\nunder the “bona fide occupational qualification” (“BFOQ”)\nexception to Title VII and FEHA. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(e)(1) (“[I]t shall not be . . . unlawful . . . for an employer to\nhire and employ employees . . . on the basis of . . . sex . . . in\nthose certain instances where . . . sex . . . is a bona fide\noccupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal\noperation of that particular business or enterprise.”). Where\ncourts have permitted sex-based staffing restrictions in\ncorrections facilities, it has typically been because the courts\nconcluded that sex was a BFOQ for the staff positions at\nissue. See, e.g., Robino, 145 F.3d at 1111; Everson v. Mich.\nDep’t of Corr., 391 F.3d 737, 761 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n    Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the\ndistrict court ruled that the County was entitled to summary\njudgment on plaintiffs’ discrimination claims because it had\nmade out a valid BFOQ defense. See Ambat v. City of S.F.,\n693 F. Supp. 2d 1130, 1141 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (“Ambat I”).\nThe district court “emphasiz[ed] that [it] is not charged with\ndetermining whether the Policy was the best means of\naddressing the problems the Sheriff and Undersheriff [Jan\nDempsey] were seeking to remedy. Rather, the [district\ncourt’s] task is limited to determining whether the Sheriff’s\n\f10    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nactions were lawful.” Id. at 1138-39. The district court also\ngranted summary judgment to the County on plaintiffs’ Title\nVII and FEHA claims that were derivative of their\ndiscrimination claims. Id. at 1142. Because it had granted\nthe County’s motion, the district court denied plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment on these claims. Id. at 1141.\n\nII. Title VII Claim\n\n     We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the County and denial of summary judgment to\nplaintiffs on their employment discrimination claims. Guatay\nChristian Fellowship v. Cnty. of San Diego, 670 F.3d 957,\n970 (9th Cir. 2011). “In doing so we are governed by the\nsame principles as the district court: whether, with the\nevidence viewed in the light most favorable to the\nnon-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material\nfact, so that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\nmatter of law.” San Diego Police Officers’ Ass’n v. San\nDiego City Emp. Ret. Sys., 568 F.3d 725, 733 (9th Cir. 2009)\n(citing Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., 363 F.3d 916, 922\n(9th Cir. 2004)).\n\n    We reverse the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the County on plaintiffs’ sex discrimination\nclaims and derivative claims. The County was not entitled to\nsummary judgment because it was unable to bear its burden\nof demonstrating that there was no genuine issue of material\nfact as to whether it was entitled to a BFOQ defense.\nBecause the district court’s conclusion that the County was\nentitled to a BFOQ defense was also the basis for its denial of\nplaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, we also vacate the\ndistrict court’s denial of plaintiffs’ motion.\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO              11\n\n   A. De Minimis Harm\n\n    Because the district court concluded that the County was\nentitled to a BFOQ defense, it did not rule on whether the\nCounty was entitled to a de minimis harm defense. We\ndecline to rule on this defense in the first instance.\n\n   B. Bona Fide Occupational Qualification Defense\n\n    Although Title VII prohibits employment discrimination\non the basis of sex in most instances, it permits discrimination\nwhere “sex . . . is a bona fide occupational qualification\nreasonably necessary to the normal operation of [the\ndefendant’s] particular business or enterprise.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(e)(1); see also Cal. Gov. Code § 12940 (excepting\ndiscrimination “based upon a bona fide occupational\nqualification” from prohibition against employment\ndiscrimination). For example, Title VII would not compel a\nproducer to audition men for a female role in a film, because\nbeing female could be a BFOQ for playing that role. See 29\nC.F.R. § 1604.2(a)(2).\n\n    Nevertheless, “[t]he BFOQ defense is written narrowly,\nand [the Supreme Court] has read it narrowly.” Int’l Union,\nUnited Auto., Aerospace & Agric. Implement Workers of Am.,\nUAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 201 (1991)\n(citations omitted). A BFOQ can be established only by\n“objective, verifiable requirements [that] concern job-related\nskills and aptitudes.” Id. at 201.\n\n    When the district court granted summary judgment to the\nCounty, it did so on the basis that being female was a BFOQ\nfor supervising female inmates in CJ8. In reaching its\nconclusion, the district court granted considerable deference\n\f12   ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nto the judgment of the Sheriff, who had asserted that the\nPolicy was necessary to protect the safety of female inmates,\nthe security of the jails, the privacy of female inmates, and\nthe ability of female inmates to be rehabilitated. Ambat I,\n693 F. Supp. 2d at 1135. Because protecting these interests\nwas part of the normal operation of San Francisco’s jails, and\nbecause the Sheriff had determined that it was reasonably\nnecessary to keep men out of supervisory roles in female\nhousing pods in order to protect these interests, the district\ncourt reasoned that the County had proven that being female\nwas indeed a BFOQ under these limited circumstances. Id.\nat 1141.\n\n     Soon after the district court granted summary judgment,\nwe considered a similar Title VII claim in Breiner. At issue\nthere was a policy implemented by the Nevada Department\nof Corrections (“NDOC”) that prohibited men from serving\nas correctional lieutenants in a women’s prison. 610 F.3d at\n1205. The policy was implemented in the wake of a scandal\narising from the prison’s “uninhibited sexual environment,”\nwhich had resulted in a female inmate’s becoming pregnant.\nId. at 1204–05. The NDOC justified its policy on three bases:\n“(1) male correctional lieutenants are likely to condone\nsexual abuse by their male subordinates; (2) male correctional\nlieutenants are themselves likely to sexually abuse female\ninmates; and (3) female correctional lieutenants possess an\n‘instinct’ that renders them less susceptible to manipulation\nby inmates and therefore better equipped to fill the\ncorrectional lieutenant role.” Id. at 1211. We reversed the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to NDOC because\n\n       NDOC ha[d] not met its burden of showing “a\n       basis in fact” for concluding that all male\n       correctional lieutenants would tolerate sexual\n\f     ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO               13\n\n       abuse by their subordinates; that all men in\n       the correctional lieutenant role would\n       themselves sexually abuse inmates; or that\n       women, by virtue of their gender, can better\n       understand the behavior of female inmates.\n       Nor ha[d] it refuted the viability of\n       alternatives that would achieve that goal\n       without impeding male employees’\n       promotional opportunities.\n\nId. at 1216 (quoting Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 335\n(1977)).\n\n    In reaching our decision, we employed a two-pronged test\nfor whether an employer had met its burden of proving that\nsex was a BFOQ:\n\n       To justify discrimination under the BFOQ\n       exception, an employer must “prove by a\n       preponderance of the evidence: 1) that the job\n       qualification justifying the discrimination is\n       reasonably necessary to the essence of its\n       business; and 2) that [sex] is a legitimate\n       proxy for the qualification because (a) it has a\n       substantial basis for believing that all or\n       nearly all [men] lack the qualification, or . . .\n       (b) it is impossible or highly impractical . . . to\n       insure by individual testing that its employees\n       will have the necessary qualifications for the\n       job.”\n\f14       ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nId. at 1210 (alterations in original) (quoting EEOC v. Boeing\nCo., 843 F.2d 1213, 1214 (9th Cir. 1988)).3\n\n    After “surveying . . . decisions applying the BFOQ\nexception in the prison context,” we observed that “even in\nthe unique context of prison employment, administrators\nseeking to justify a BFOQ must show ‘a high correlation\nbetween sex and ability to perform job functions.’” Id. at\n1211–13 (quoting Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at 202). We\nalso recognized that it would be impossible to prove a BFOQ\ndefense without “demonstrat[ing] that . . . alternative\napproaches . . . are not viable.” Id. at 1215.\n\n    In light of our decision in Breiner, plaintiffs moved for\nreconsideration of the district court’s summary judgment\nrulings on their sex discrimination claims. The district court\ndenied the motion, concluding that Breiner was factually\ndistinguishable from this case and so did not compel a\ndifferent result. Ambat v. City of S.F., 2010 WL 3340549 at\n*3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2010) (“Ambat II”). Although we\nagree that the facts in these two cases are not identical, we\nconclude that Breiner controls our decision here and provides\nthe correct analytic framework for evaluating the County’s\nmotion for summary judgment. However, before we consider\nthe justifications for the Policy that the County has advanced\nunder our two-step BFOQ inquiry, we must first address the\nissue of the deference owed to the Sheriff’s judgment in\nimplementing the Policy.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n     We initially adopted this test for the purpose of evaluating sex\ndiscrimination claims under Title VII in 1980.

Deference to the Sheriff’s Judgment\n\n     “Judgments by prison administrators that ‘are the product\nof a reasoned decision-making process, based on available\ninformation and experience,’ are entitled to some deference.”\nBreiner, 610 F.3d at 1212 n.6 (quoting Robino, 145 F.3d at\n1110); see also Henry v. Milwaukee Cnty., 539 F.3d 573,\n580–81 (7th Cir. 2008) (“[T]he administrators of female\ncorrectional facilities . . . are entitled to substantial deference\nwhen fashioning policies to further the goals of the facility. . .\n[H]owever, . . . the discretion accorded to these individuals\n. . . is [not] effectively unlimited. A defendant ultimately\nmust introduce sufficient evidence to prove that the\nadministrator’s judgment . . . is ‘the product of a reasoned\ndecision-making process, based on available information and\nexperience.’” (quoting Torres v. Wisconsin Dep’t of Health\n& Soc. Servs., 859 F.2d 1523, 1532 (7th Cir. 1988))).\n\n    Deference often plays a significant role in supporting a\nBFOQ defense in the corrections context, and we do not\ndownplay the importance of respecting the judgment of the\nofficials who are most knowledgeable about how best to\naddress the challenges posed by a particular institution.\nNevertheless, such deference is not automatic. We require\nthat such a judgment be the result of a “reasoned\ndecision-making process, based on available information and\nexperience,” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1214; otherwise, deference\nto that judgment cannot play a role in our BFOQ inquiry.\n\n    Here, the record demonstrates that there are genuine\nissues of material fact as to whether or not such a process led\nto the Sheriff’s adoption of the Policy. In support of SFSD’s\ndecision-making process, the Sheriff asserts that he discussed\nthe Policy with Undersheriff Dempsey, the Chief of the\n\f16    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nCustody Division, and jail commanders for “months.” He\nalso claims to have consulted “incident reports of misconduct\nor alleged misconduct.” However, while the prevention of\nsexual misconduct was offered by the Sheriff as his primary\nreason for adopting the Policy, SFSD did not conduct any\ninternal surveys or studies to determine the extent of that\nmisconduct. Neither the Sheriff nor Undersheriff Dempsey\nattempted to consult the deputies directly responsible for\nsupervising the inmates in order to learn from their front-line\nexperience. Further, the Sheriff testified that he did not\nconsult any outside sources – not even his counterparts in\nother jurisdictions who may have considered similar policies\n– with the exception that the Undersheriff communicated to\nhim that she had contacted an uncertain number of other\nCalifornia sheriff’s departments to ask about whether they\nhad implemented similar policies. The Sheriff also testified\nthat he had read about incidents of sexual abuse in the\nMichigan prison system, but that he did not do so until after\nthe Policy was implemented and that his reading “reinforced”\nrather than informed his decision to implement the Policy.\n\n    Determining whether a corrections official is entitled to\ndeference is a fact-intensive and case-specific inquiry;\naccordingly, it is generally within the discretion of the district\ncourt to determine which factors are relevant. The district\ncourt observed that it had “uncovered no case holding that a\ncorrectional official must undertake a particular type of study\nor consultation,” Ambat I, 693 F. Supp. 2d at 1138 (emphasis\nin original), and we are not arriving at a contrary holding.\nThat is to say, we are not concluding that the decision-making\nprocess supporting a discriminatory policy needs to take any\nparticular form. However, it is significant that the extent of\nthe Sheriff’s efforts to ensure that his judgment was the result\nof available information and experience contrasts sharply\n\f     ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             17\n\nwith the efforts undertaken by other officials implementing\nsimilar policies that have withstood Title VII challenges on\nBFOQ grounds. See, e.g., Robino, 145 F.3d at 1111 (“To\ncomply with an EEOC settlement, [corrections officials]\nconducted an extensive survey of post duties before\ndetermining which posts should be designated female-only.”);\nEverson, 391 F.3d at 741–45 (describing how three studies\nwere conducted, including one pursuant to a settlement with\nthe DOJ); cf. Torres, 859 F.2d at 1531–32 (holding that\nprison officials were required to “innovate” in order to serve\nthe rehabilitative interests of the female inmates, because\nempirical studies concerning the rehabilitation of female\ninmates “simply did not exist” at the time).\n\n    The district court appears to have granted the Sheriff’s\njudgment deference based primarily on his substantial\nqualifications, rather than on the characteristics of the\ndecision-making process itself. This reasoning is not\nconsistent with our precedent, which conditions deference on\nwhether the decision-making process itself was reasoned and\nwell-informed. See Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1214; Robino,\n145 F.3d at 1110. While we need not decide precisely how\n“reasoned” the decision-making process must be, nor how\nmuch of the “available information and experience” a\ncorrections official must consider before implementing a\nfacially discriminatory policy, the record before us now\nclearly exhibits a genuine dispute over whether the Policy\nresulted from a “reasoned decision-making process, based on\navailable information and experience.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at\n1214 (quoting Robino, 145 F.3d at 1110). Considering the\nevidence in the record in the light most favorable to the\nplaintiffs, as we must on the County’s motion for summary\njudgment, a trier of fact could conclude that the Sheriff’s\njudgment was not preceded by a decision-making process that\n\f18    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nwas sufficiently reasoned in proportion to the seriousness of\nimposing the Policy. Similarly, a trier of fact could also\nconclude that the seriousness of imposing the Policy required\nthe Sheriff to make a greater effort to avail himself of the\ninformation and experience readily available to him – such as\nby conducting relevant surveys or studies, as in Robino and\nEverson, or by consulting with officials in other jurisdictions\nwho had considered or implemented policies like the one he\nultimately implemented, as plaintiffs suggest.\n\n    Thus, because a trier of fact considering the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to plaintiffs could conclude that the\ndecision-making process was either insufficiently reasoned or\ninsufficiently based on available information and experience,\nthe County cannot meet its burden of showing that the\nSheriff’s judgment is entitled to deference as a matter of law,\nand the County may not rely on such deference in meeting its\nburden of showing that there are no genuine disputes of fact\nas to whether it can satisfy our two-step BFOQ inquiry.\n\n       2. Job Qualifications Reasonably Necessary to the\n          Essence of Operating San Francisco’s Jails\n\n    Although deference to the Sheriff’s judgment cannot play\na role in our analysis, it is still necessary for us to consider\neach rationale that has been offered by the County in order to\ndetermine whether the County is able to satisfy our BFOQ\ninquiry based solely on the evidence in the record. We must\nconsider each of the four rationales offered by the County in\norder to determine (1) whether any rationale suggests a job\nqualification reasonably necessary to the essence of operating\nSFSD’s jails, and, if so, (2) whether sex is a legitimate proxy\nfor determining whether a deputy actually has that\nqualification. Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1210.\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO                19\n\n    In considering each of the County’s rationales, the County\neasily meets its burden, as a matter of law, of demonstrating\nthat there are job qualifications derived from the four\njustifications that are reasonably necessary to the essence of\noperating SFSD’s jails. Each of the four justifications that\nthe Sheriff claims drove his decision to implement the Policy\n– protecting female inmates from sexual misconduct by male\ndeputies, maintaining jail security, protecting inmate privacy,\nand preserving the ability of female inmates to rehabilitate –\nis essential to the operation of a corrections facility and has\nbeen recognized as justifying facially discriminatory policies\nin other contexts. See Dothard, 433 U.S. at 335 (security);\nRobino, 145 F.3d at 1111 (safety, security, privacy,\nrehabilitation); Everson, 391 F.3d at 750 (safety, security,\nprivacy, rehabilitation).\n\n     Based on these important rationales for the Policy, we\nhave no difficulty in identifying four “job qualification[s] . . .\nreasonably necessary to the essence of” operating SFSD’s\njails, any of which would satisfy the first prong of our test.\nBreiner, 610 F.3d at 1210.               These qualifications\ncorresponding to the four rationales are (1) not posing a threat\nto the safety of female inmates due to a likelihood of\nperpetrating sexual misconduct against them; (2) not posing\na threat to jail security; (3) not posing a threat to female\ninmates’ privacy; and (4) not posing a threat to female\ninmates’ ability to rehabilitate. We now consider each of\nthese four qualifications under the second prong of our test to\ndetermine whether there is any genuine dispute of material\nfact as to whether being male is a “legitimate proxy” for any\nof them.\n\f20    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\n        3. Whether Sex Is a Legitimate Proxy for\n           Reasonably Necessary Job Qualifications\n\n    The County may show that excluding all male deputies is\na “legitimate proxy” for excluding deputies who lack one of\nthe four qualifications if there is (a) “a substantial basis for\nbelieving that all or nearly all [men] lack the qualification” or\n(b) “it is impossible or highly impractical . . . to insure by\nindividual testing” whether or not a male deputy has the\nqualification. Id. at 1210 (alteration in original). We also\nnote that it is impossible to satisfy the “legitimate proxy”\nprong if there is no “concrete, logical basis for concluding\nthat gender restrictions are ‘reasonably necessary,’” id. at\n1212, or if alternatives have not been reasonably considered\nand refuted, id. at 1216.\n\n    The County asserts that the primary reason for the\nSheriff’s adoption of the Policy was to protect the safety of\nfemale inmates by reducing the possibility of sexual\nharassment and abuse by male deputies. While there is no\nquestion that this is an extremely important interest, the\nCounty has not met its burden of showing that there is no\ngenuine dispute over whether excluding men from\nsupervisory positions in female housing units is a legitimate\nproxy for requiring that deputies in those positions not pose\na threat to the safety of female inmates. More specifically, at\nthis stage of the proceeding, the County has not shown that\nthe Sheriff had “a substantial basis for believing that all or\nnearly all” male deputies were likely to engage in sexual\nmisconduct with female inmates, nor has it shown that “it is\nimpossible or highly impractical . . . to insure by individual\ntesting” that a male deputy does not pose such a threat. Id. at\n1210.\n\f     ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             21\n\n    The statistics on sexual misconduct perpetrated by male\ndeputies against female inmates in SFSD’s jails are deeply\ntroubling. The record shows that in the five years preceding\nthe implementation of the Policy, ten allegations of sexual\nmisconduct were made; two more allegations were made the\nyear after the Policy was implemented. A substantial portion\nof these allegations were sustained or were followed by a\ndeputy’s resignation. We also accept that it is reasonable to\nassume, as the County argues, that other instances of\nmisconduct may have gone unreported.\n\n    Nevertheless, these statistics by themselves do not prove\nthat “all or substantially all” male deputies are likely to\nperpetrate sexual misconduct. To suggest that all or most\nmale deputies pose such a threat would amount to “the kind\nof unproven and invidious stereotype that Congress sought to\neliminate from employment decisions when it enacted Title\nVII.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1211.\n\n    On this record, the County is also unable to show that\nthere is no genuine dispute as to whether it is impossible or\nhighly impractical to insure by individual testing that a male\ndeputy does not have a propensity to perpetrate sexual\nmisconduct. We have observed that background checks,\nwhich all deputies must undergo, are among “prison\nadministrators[’] . . . multiple resources . . . to ensure\ncompliance with institutional rules.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at\n1215. As the County points out, peace officer candidates\nmust also undergo psychological examinations.\n\n    While conceding that background checks and\npsychological testing are used for the purpose of screening\nfor a propensity to perpetrate sexual misconduct, the County\nsuggests that such screening mechanisms are inadequate\n\f22    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nbecause they are unable to detect all potential perpetrators.\nRemoving every deputy with any potential for engaging in\nmisconduct may be a laudable goal, but that goal is\ninsufficient to justify a policy that discriminates in such broad\nstrokes. Rather, we have observed that a BFOQ defense\ncannot be maintained if available testing offers “a practical\nreliable differentiation of the unqualified from the qualified\napplicant, [even if it is] not a perfect differentiation.” See\nE.E.O.C. v. L.A. Cnty., 706 F.2d 1039, 1040, 1043 (9th Cir.\n1983) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The\nrecord before us does not resolve the genuine dispute over\nwhether the tests that are presently used or that could be used\nby SFSD would permit it to make a practical reliable\ndifferentiation between those who are likely to engage in\nsexual misconduct and those who are not.\n\n    The County also argues that employing male deputies in\nthe female housing pods poses a threat to jail security. In so\narguing, it points to two specific assertions offered by the\nSheriff. First, the Sheriff expressed concern that male\ndeputies were particularly vulnerable to manipulation by\nfemale inmates, potentially leading them to overlook conduct\nin violation of jail regulations, such as smuggling contraband\ninto the jail. Second, he claimed that the consequence of\nmale deputies’ fear of being accused of sexual misconduct\ncould be that those deputies would be unwilling to supervise\nfemale inmates as closely as necessary, leading to an even\ngreater risk of female inmates being able to violate jail rules.\n\n    However, the record on summary judgment is insufficient\nto demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute as to whether\n“all or substantially all” male deputies would be vulnerable\nto manipulation by female inmates or as to whether it would\nbe “impossible or highly impractical” to test for whether a\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             23\n\nmale deputy is manipulable. The County has introduced no\nevidence, even in the declarations of SFSD officials, that\nwould support this conclusion. Likewise, the County has\nfailed to demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute over\nwhether “all or substantially all” male deputies would be\ninfluenced by fear of false allegations, or over whether it\nwould be “impossible or highly impractical” to test for such\nbehavior. The Sheriff himself acknowledged that he has “no\nidea” how widespread this purported problem is. He also\nadmitted that he is unaware of whether any efforts were made\nwithin SFSD to explore non-discriminatory alternatives to the\nPolicy for the purpose of mitigating the potential effect of\nfalse allegations leveled at male deputies. Thus there is a\ngenuine question as to whether the County is able to “refute[]\nthe viability of [non-discriminatory] alternatives.” Breiner,\n610 F.3d at 1216.\n\n    The County’s third justification for the Policy is\nprotecting the privacy interests of female inmates. However,\nthe record does not demonstrate that there is an actual risk of\nfemale inmates’ privacy being compromised by male\ndeputies. SFSD has policies in place to prevent male deputies\nfrom taking on duties, such as strip searches, that might\nviolate the privacy of female inmates. The inmates are\nrequired to remain clothed at all times, except when\nshowering. When showering or using the toilet, inmates’\nbodies are covered by a privacy screen.\n\n    The Sheriff claims that the use of privacy screens\ncompromises jail security, but there is a genuine dispute as to\nwhether privacy screens actually do compromise jail security\nwhere, as here, the screens remained in use even after the\nPolicy was adopted. See Torres, 859 F.2d at 1526 (finding\nthat a BFOQ defense could not be sustained over privacy\n\f24    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nconcerns where “the [district] court noted that [corrections\nofficials] continued to allow [female] inmates to use privacy\ncards even after the BFOQ program [requiring female guards]\nhad been installed, thus rebutting the argument that the\npresence of male guards reduced observation of the\ninmates”).\n\n    The County’s final justification for the Policy is\npromoting the rehabilitation of female inmates. The Sheriff\nasserts that he was concerned that surveillance by male\ndeputies could traumatize female inmates, particularly those\nwho had suffered physical or sexual abuse in the past. The\nCounty introduced evidence that a disproportionately high\nnumber of female inmates had suffered such abuse.\nNevertheless, there is a genuine dispute over whether\nexcluding male deputies is a legitimate proxy for excluding\ndeputies who would interfere with female inmates’\nrehabilitation.\n\n    A “staffing restriction . . . must match . . . ‘job functions’\nwith a high degree of specificity to be found reasonably\nnecessary.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1213 (quoting Johnson\nControls, 499 U.S. at 202). In this situation, SFSD has\nseparated the functions of supervising the inmates in the\nhousing pods from the functions of providing rehabilitative\nprogramming to the inmates, such as through a high school\nprogram, support groups, and parenting classes. Further,\nthere is no evidence in the record that the individuals staffing\nthe rehabilitative programs, some of which are staffed by\nindependent contractors, are themselves required to be\nfemale. If female inmates were supervised by men in their\nrehabilitative programs while the Policy was in effect, that\nfact alone would defeat the County’s argument that excluding\nmen from supervisory roles was necessary to promote female\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             25\n\ninmates’ rehabilitation. See Henry, 539 F.3d at 582-83\n(“[I]nconsistencies in implementation cast a significant doubt\non whether the policy is reasonably necessary.”). As\nplaintiffs observe, there is also conflicting expert testimony\nover whether isolating female inmates from men might in fact\nimpede the inmates’ efforts at rehabilitation; for example,\nplaintiffs’ expert discussed research indicating that the\npresence of male officers might itself promote the\nrehabilitation of female inmates.\n\n   C. Conclusion\n\n    The justifications offered by the County in support of the\nPolicy each speak to extremely important concerns, and the\nSheriff is to be commended for his attention to the welfare of\nfemale inmates in San Francisco’s jails. However, the fact\nthat the Policy seeks to advance such important goals as\ninmate safety is not, by itself, sufficient to permit\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. When moving for\nsummary judgment, the County bears the heavy burden of\nshowing that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to\nwhether excluding male deputies because of their sex is a\nlegitimate substitute for excluding them because they are\nactually unfit to serve in the female housing pods. On the\nrecord before us, the County has not made such a showing.\n\n    Discrimination on the basis of sex is almost always\ndisfavored under Title VII. Thus, even in a correctional\nsetting, our test for whether an employer is entitled to a\nBFOQ defense – that is, whether an employer has shown that\ndiscrimination is “reasonably necessary,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(e)(1) – is purposefully difficult to satisfy. It is even more\ndifficult when an employer moves for summary judgment and\nso must show that there are no genuine disputes that would\n\f26    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nprevent it from satisfying our two-step inquiry as a matter of\nlaw. While we do not reach the issue of whether the County\ncould ultimately prevail on plaintiffs’ discrimination claims,\nthe factual disputes in this case prevent the County from\nprevailing at this stage.\n\n     We are mindful that deference often plays a significant\nrole in allowing a defendant to meet its burden of proving that\nit is entitled to a BFOQ defense in the corrections context,\nand we do not downplay the importance of courts deferring\nto the judgment of officials like the Sheriff, who has\ntremendous experience and expertise with respect to all\naspects of operating San Francisco’s jails. But, again, such\ndeference is not automatic, no matter how extensive an\nofficial’s qualifications. A discriminatory employment policy\nis an extraordinary response to a workplace problem, and our\nprinciple of deferring to the judgments of corrections officials\nhas its roots in the expectation that officials have made\ncommensurate efforts to determine that a discriminatory\npolicy is a necessary response and the only viable response.\nThus, while we don’t presume to be able to second-guess an\nofficial’s judgment, we do require that such a judgment be\n“‘the product of a reasoned decision-making process, based\non available information and experience.’” Breiner, 610 F.3d\nat 1212 n.6 (quoting Robino, 145 F.3d at 1110).\n\n    We need not and do not reach a conclusion about whether\nthe Sheriff’s judgment was the result of such a reasoned\nprocess. However, on the record before us, we cannot find as\nmatter of law that the Policy resulted from such a process.\nTherefore, on summary judgment, the County may not rely\non deference to the Sheriff’s judgment in order to meet its\nburden of proving that it was entitled to a BFOQ defense. In\nthe absence of deference to the Sheriff’s judgment, the\n\f       ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO            27\n\nCounty is also unable to meet its burden of proving that there\nis no issue of material fact as to whether its policy of\nexcluding all male deputies from the female housing units is\na legitimate proxy for excluding only those deputies that truly\npose a threat to the important interests SFSD rightfully seeks\nto protect. The district court’s grant of summary judgment as\nto plaintiffs’ sex discrimination claims and other claims\npredicated thereon is REVERSED.\n\n    Because the district court denied plaintiffs’ summary\njudgment motion on the same grounds that it granted the\nCounty’s motion, the district court’s denial of summary\njudgment to plaintiffs on these same claims is VACATED.\nThis case is REMANDED for further proceedings on these\nclaims.\n\nIII.    Evidentiary Claims\n\n    Prior to the district court’s ruling on the parties’ cross-\nmotions for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ discrimination\nclaims, plaintiffs made numerous objections to evidence\noffered by the County in support of its motion – particularly\nto declarations submitted by SFSD officials. The district\ncourt overruled three of the objections; it did not explicitly\nrule on the remainder of the objections but relied on the\nchallenged evidence in its summary judgment order.\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court’s explicit and implicit\nevidentiary rulings in the County’s favor.\n\n    “We review the district court’s evidentiary decisions for\nabuse of discretion, and the appellant is . . . required to\nestablish that the error was prejudicial.” Allstate Ins. Co. v.\nHerron, 634 F.3d 1101, 1110 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Because we reverse the district\n\f28    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment on plaintiffs’\ndiscrimination claims, plaintiffs cannot establish prejudice;\nplaintiffs will have the opportunity to challenge the district\ncourt’s evidentiary rulings if they are unsuccessful on\nremand. Plaintiffs’ evidentiary challenges are DISMISSED.\n\nIV.     Attorney’s Fees\n\n    In addition to their sex discrimination claims, plaintiffs\nfiled various retaliation claims, also under Title VII and\nFEHA. The district court granted summary judgment to the\nCounty as to all but three plaintiffs, and the County settled the\nremaining claims. Plaintiffs moved for attorney’s fees in the\namount of $127,447.26 for having settled these claims. After\nan in camera review of plaintiffs’ counsel’s time sheets, the\ndistrict court awarded $8,925 for “retaliation-specific work,”\nobserving that plaintiffs could not recover “fees for time\ndevoted to litigating the gender discrimination claims.”\nPlaintiffs contend on appeal that the fee award is not\ncommensurate with the extent of their success.\n\n     “[I]n a lawsuit where the plaintiff presents different\nclaims for relief that ‘involve a common core of facts’ or are\nbased on ‘related legal theories,’ the district court should not\nattempt to divide the request for attorney’s fees on a\nclaim-by-claim basis. Instead, the court must . . . ‘focus on\nthe significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff\nin relation to the hours reasonably expended on the\nlitigation.’” McCown v. City of Fontana, 565 F.3d 1097,\n1103 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S.\n424, 435 (1983)). In sum, “the district court should\nadequately explain the reasonable number of hours and\nhourly rate it uses in calculating the fee, and appropriately\nadjust the award to account for [a plaintiff’s] limited success\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             29\n\non claims and damages, and for any public benefit derived\nfrom his suit.” Id. at 1105.\n\n    The district court concluded that plaintiffs’ success was\nminor relative to the scope of the sex discrimination action,\nand it awarded fees accordingly. Reviewing for abuse of\ndiscretion, Hemmings v. Tidyman’s Inc., 285 F.3d 1174, 1200\n(9th Cir. 2002), we see no indication that the district court\nabused its discretion in making the award that it did. Under\nthe district court’s own reasoning, plaintiffs will be entitled\nto a substantially greater award if they are successful on\nremand. The district court’s award of attorney’s fees is\nAFFIRMED.\n\nV. Gray’s Retaliation Claims\n\n    John Gray was among the plaintiffs who claimed\nretaliation and against whom the district court granted\nsummary judgment; the district court was correct in its\njudgment. Gray disseminated defamatory statements about\nseveral individuals, amounting to what the SFSD deemed\n“[c]onduct, on or off duty, which reflects adversely on the\nSFSD.” As a result, he was terminated. Gray is unable to\nrebut the County’s evidence that his conduct was the non-\nretaliatory motive for his termination, Munoz v. Mabus,\n630 F.3d 856, 865 (9th Cir. 2010), nor can he “produce direct\nor circumstantial evidence demonstrating that a\ndiscriminatory reason more likely than not motivated” the\nCounty, McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1122\n(9th Cir. 2004). Further, his argument that his defamatory\nstatements, because they were made in connection with an\nearlier employment-related arbitration, are protected by\nCalifornia law from being used as evidence in this action is\nwithout merit. See Oren Royal Oaks Venture v. Greenberg,\n\f30   ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nBernhard, Weiss & Karma, Inc., 728 P.2d 1202, 1208 (Cal.\n1986). The district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\nCounty on Gray’s retaliation claims is AFFIRMED.\n\n    AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, VACATED\nin part, DISMISSED in part, and REMANDED for further\nproceedings. Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\f",

The\ndistrict court concluded that SFSD’s policy did not violate\nTitle VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination because it fell\nwithin the statute’s “bona fide occupational qualification”\nexception, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(e)(1). We reverse the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to the County on the sex\ndiscrimination claims and vacate the denial of summary\njudgment to plaintiffs on those claims.\n\nI. Facts and Procedural History\n\n    In October 2006, SFSD implemented a new policy\nprohibiting male deputies from supervising female inmates in\nthe housing units of the jails operated by the County (the\n“Policy”). Single-sex staffing policies in correctional\n\f6     ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nfacilities are not new, and we have considered before whether\nsuch polices violate Title VII by impermissibly\ndiscriminating on the basis of sex. See Breiner v.

CJ8 has a “direct supervision” design,\nmeaning that its housing units, or “pods,” are composed of\ncells or sleeping bays arrayed around a central congregation\nspace. Each pod has two tiers and between 56 and 88 beds.\nAt the center of the pod is a podium from which a deputy can\nsee into common areas and into the cells and sleeping bays.\nEach pod is staffed by two deputies, one of whom remains at\nthe podium while the other makes rounds. Female inmates\nfill some, but not all, of the available housing pods in CJ8.\nEven though CJ8 is not single-sex, all of its pods are single-\nsex. This is consistent with SFSD’s long-standing practice of\nsegregating female and male inmates.\n\n    Although housing pods are single-sex, CJ8’s pod for\ninmates receiving medical or psychiatric care is not sex-\nsegregated. Male deputies are not permitted under the Policy\nto work with female inmates in the housing pods; however,\nmale deputies may be assigned to the mixed-sex medical pod\nor assigned to transport female inmates between CJ8 and\nother locations. Male deputies may also enter female housing\npods in some circumstances, such as to assist with feeding\nfemale inmates.\n\f        ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO            7\n\n    According to San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessey\n(the “Sheriff”), who had held his position since 1980,1 he\nadopted the Policy for four reasons: (1) to protect the safety\nof female inmates from sexual misconduct perpetrated by\nmale deputies, (2) to maintain the security of the jail in the\nface of female inmates’ ability to manipulate male deputies\nand of the deputies’ fear of false allegations of sexual\nmisconduct by the inmates, (3) to protect the privacy of\nfemale inmates, and (4) to promote the successful\nrehabilitation of female inmates.\n\n    Of the four reasons the Sheriff claims led him to enact the\nPolicy, he identified protecting the safety of inmates from\nsexual misconduct as the most important. As the County\npointed out, between 2001 and 2009, SFSD investigated\ntwelve complaints of sexual misconduct or inappropriate\nsexual relationships between a male deputy and a female\ninmate. Ten of those incidents occurred before the Policy\nwas implemented in 2006, and two occurred after. Notably,\nfour of the twelve incidents occurred in 2005, the year\nimmediately preceding the implementation of the Policy.\nSFSD sustained the allegations of misconduct and disciplined\ndeputies in two of the incidents: a 2001 incident in which a\nmale deputy had an inappropriate relationship with a female\ninmate with the intent to “cultivate a sexual relationship” and\na 2007 incident, after the Policy had been adopted, in which\na male deputy was present during a female inmate’s strip\nsearch. Three additional investigations were followed by a\ndeputy’s resignation; these concerned inappropriate contact\nor sex acts. SFSD also faced lawsuits in 2000 and 2005\nalleging that male deputies had engaged in unlawful sexual\nmisconduct with female inmates.\n\n 1\n     Sheriff Hennessey no longer holds this office.\n\f8       ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\n    With this concern for inmate safety in mind, the Sheriff\nasserts that he considered three responses, apart from\nenacting the Policy, to the problem of protecting female\ninmates from sexual misconduct: (1) implementing additional\nscreening of male deputies to determine whether they were\nlikely to engage in sexual misconduct with female inmates,\n(2) installing additional surveillance cameras to monitor\nactivities in CJ8’s housing pods, and (3) providing additional\ntraining to deputies. However, he claims to have rejected\neach of these alternatives as ineffective or unfeasible, so he\nproceeded to implement the Policy.\n\n    In July 2007, 35 deputies – a majority of whom were\nfemale – filed suit against the County, alleging that the policy\nconstituted sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(a), and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act\n(“FEHA”), Cal. Gov. Code § 12940. Title VII and FEHA\nboth make it “unlawful, with narrow exceptions, ‘to fail or\nrefuse to hire . . . any individual, or otherwise to discriminate\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of\nsuch individual’s . . . sex.’” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1207\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)).2 Plaintiffs claimed that\nthe Policy directly caused them a variety of harms related to\nthe conditions of their employment. For example, they\nclaimed that staffing restrictions caused by the Policy resulted\nin loss of control over when overtime was available or\nrequired, loss of opportunities to develop career-enhancing\nexperience, and loss of preferred shifts and regular days off\n\n\n    2\n   Because FEHA is interpreted consistently with Title VII, see Guz v.\nBechtel Nat’l Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569285\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569285/guz-v-bechtel-national-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 2000), we conduct our analysis of\nboth federal and state claims according to Title VII case law.\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO                  9\n\npreviously earned by seniority. Plaintiffs made additional\nclaims based on their sex discrimination claims: for unlawful\nemployment restrictions under Title VII and FEHA and for\nfailure to prevent a violation of FEHA.\n\n    In response, the County first argued that any harm\nsuffered by plaintiffs as a result of the Policy was exceedingly\nminor, or de minimis, and so was not actionable. Although it\ndid not dispute that the Policy discriminates against deputies\non the basis of sex, the County further argued that the\ndiscrimination that resulted from the Policy was permissible\nunder the “bona fide occupational qualification” (“BFOQ”)\nexception to Title VII and FEHA. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(e)(1) (“[I]t shall not be . . . unlawful . . . for an employer to\nhire and employ employees . . . on the basis of . . . sex . . . in\nthose certain instances where . . . sex . . . is a bona fide\noccupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal\noperation of that particular business or enterprise.”). Where\ncourts have permitted sex-based staffing restrictions in\ncorrections facilities, it has typically been because the courts\nconcluded that sex was a BFOQ for the staff positions at\nissue. See, e.g., Robino, 145 F.3d at 1111; Everson v.

The district court also\ngranted summary judgment to the County on plaintiffs’ Title\nVII and FEHA claims that were derivative of their\ndiscrimination claims. Id. at 1142.

The County was not entitled to\nsummary judgment because it was unable to bear its burden\nof demonstrating that there was no genuine issue of material\nfact as to whether it was entitled to a BFOQ defense.\nBecause the district court’s conclusion that the County was\nentitled to a BFOQ defense was also the basis for its denial of\nplaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, we also vacate the\ndistrict court’s denial of plaintiffs’ motion.\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO              11\n\n   A. De Minimis Harm\n\n    Because the district court concluded that the County was\nentitled to a BFOQ defense, it did not rule on whether the\nCounty was entitled to a de minimis harm defense. We\ndecline to rule on this defense in the first instance.\n\n   B. Bona Fide Occupational Qualification Defense\n\n    Although Title VII prohibits employment discrimination\non the basis of sex in most instances, it permits discrimination\nwhere “sex . . . is a bona fide occupational qualification\nreasonably necessary to the normal operation of [the\ndefendant’s] particular business or enterprise.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(e)(1); see also Cal. Gov. Code § 12940 (excepting\ndiscrimination “based upon a bona fide occupational\nqualification” from prohibition against employment\ndiscrimination). For example, Title VII would not compel a\nproducer to audition men for a female role in a film, because\nbeing female could be a BFOQ for playing that role. See 29\nC.F.R. § 1604.2(a)(2).\n\n    Nevertheless, “[t]he BFOQ defense is written narrowly,\nand [the Supreme Court] has read it narrowly.” Int’l Union,\nUnited Auto., Aerospace & Agric. Implement Workers of Am.,\nUAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112563\"><a href=\"/opinion/112563/automobile-workers-v-johnson-controls-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (1991)\n(citations omitted). A BFOQ can be established only by\n“objective, verifiable requirements [that] concern job-related\nskills and aptitudes.” Id. at 201.\n\n    When the district court granted summary judgment to the\nCounty, it did so on the basis that being female was a BFOQ\nfor supervising female inmates in CJ8. In reaching its\nconclusion, the district court granted considerable deference\n\f12   ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nto the judgment of the Sheriff, who had asserted that the\nPolicy was necessary to protect the safety of female inmates,\nthe security of the jails, the privacy of female inmates, and\nthe ability of female inmates to be rehabilitated. Ambat I,\n693 F. Supp. 2d at 1135. Because protecting these interests\nwas part of the normal operation of San Francisco’s jails, and\nbecause the Sheriff had determined that it was reasonably\nnecessary to keep men out of supervisory roles in female\nhousing pods in order to protect these interests, the district\ncourt reasoned that the County had proven that being female\nwas indeed a BFOQ under these limited circumstances. Id.\nat 1141.\n\n     Soon after the district court granted summary judgment,\nwe considered a similar Title VII claim in Breiner. At issue\nthere was a policy implemented by the Nevada Department\nof Corrections (“NDOC”) that prohibited men from serving\nas correctional lieutenants in a women’s prison. 610 F.3d at\n1205. The policy was implemented in the wake of a scandal\narising from the prison’s “uninhibited sexual environment,”\nwhich had resulted in a female inmate’s becoming pregnant.\nId. at 1204–05. The NDOC justified its policy on three bases:\n“(1) male correctional lieutenants are likely to condone\nsexual abuse by their male subordinates; (2) male correctional\nlieutenants are themselves likely to sexually abuse female\ninmates; and (3) female correctional lieutenants possess an\n‘instinct’ that renders them less susceptible to manipulation\nby inmates and therefore better equipped to fill the\ncorrectional lieutenant role.” Id. at 1211. We reversed the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment to NDOC because\n\n       NDOC ha[d] not met its burden of showing “a\n       basis in fact” for concluding that all male\n       correctional lieutenants would tolerate sexual\n\f     ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO               13\n\n       abuse by their subordinates; that all men in\n       the correctional lieutenant role would\n       themselves sexually abuse inmates; or that\n       women, by virtue of their gender, can better\n       understand the behavior of female inmates.\n       Nor ha[d] it refuted the viability of\n       alternatives that would achieve that goal\n       without impeding male employees’\n       promotional opportunities.\n\nId. at 1216 (quoting Dothard v. Rawlinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109725\"><a href=\"/opinion/109725/dothard-v-rawlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335\n(1977)).\n\n    In reaching our decision, we employed a two-pronged test\nfor whether an employer had met its burden of proving that\nsex was a BFOQ:\n\n       To justify discrimination under the BFOQ\n       exception, an employer must “prove by a\n       preponderance of the evidence: 1) that the job\n       qualification justifying the discrimination is\n       reasonably necessary to the essence of its\n       business; and 2) that [sex] is a legitimate\n       proxy for the qualification because (a) it has a\n       substantial basis for believing that all or\n       nearly all [men] lack the qualification, or . . .\n       (b) it is impossible or highly impractical . . . to\n       insure by individual testing that its employees\n       will have the necessary qualifications for the\n       job.”\n\f14       ANDERSON V.

We\nalso recognized that it would be impossible to prove a BFOQ\ndefense without “demonstrat[ing] that . . . alternative\napproaches . . . are not viable.” Id. at 1215.\n\n    In light of our decision in Breiner, plaintiffs moved for\nreconsideration of the district court’s summary judgment\nrulings on their sex discrimination claims. The district court\ndenied the motion, concluding that Breiner was factually\ndistinguishable from this case and so did not compel a\ndifferent result. Ambat v. City of S.F., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3340549</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n*3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2010) (“Ambat II”). Although we\nagree that the facts in these two cases are not identical, we\nconclude that Breiner controls our decision here and provides\nthe correct analytic framework for evaluating the County’s\nmotion for summary judgment. However, before we consider\nthe justifications for the Policy that the County has advanced\nunder our two-step BFOQ inquiry, we must first address the\nissue of the deference owed to the Sheriff’s judgment in\nimplementing the Policy.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n     We initially adopted this test for the purpose of evaluating sex\ndiscrimination claims under Title VII in 1980.

We require\nthat such a judgment be the result of a “reasoned\ndecision-making process, based on available information and\nexperience,” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1214; otherwise, deference\nto that judgment cannot play a role in our BFOQ inquiry.\n\n    Here, the record demonstrates that there are genuine\nissues of material fact as to whether or not such a process led\nto the Sheriff’s adoption of the Policy. In support of SFSD’s\ndecision-making process, the Sheriff asserts that he discussed\nthe Policy with Undersheriff Dempsey, the Chief of the\n\f16    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nCustody Division, and jail commanders for “months.” He\nalso claims to have consulted “incident reports of misconduct\nor alleged misconduct.” However, while the prevention of\nsexual misconduct was offered by the Sheriff as his primary\nreason for adopting the Policy, SFSD did not conduct any\ninternal surveys or studies to determine the extent of that\nmisconduct. Neither the Sheriff nor Undersheriff Dempsey\nattempted to consult the deputies directly responsible for\nsupervising the inmates in order to learn from their front-line\nexperience. Further, the Sheriff testified that he did not\nconsult any outside sources – not even his counterparts in\nother jurisdictions who may have considered similar policies\n– with the exception that the Undersheriff communicated to\nhim that she had contacted an uncertain number of other\nCalifornia sheriff’s departments to ask about whether they\nhad implemented similar policies. The Sheriff also testified\nthat he had read about incidents of sexual abuse in the\nMichigan prison system, but that he did not do so until after\nthe Policy was implemented and that his reading “reinforced”\nrather than informed his decision to implement the Policy.\n\n    Determining whether a corrections official is entitled to\ndeference is a fact-intensive and case-specific inquiry;\naccordingly, it is generally within the discretion of the district\ncourt to determine which factors are relevant. The district\ncourt observed that it had “uncovered no case holding that a\ncorrectional official must undertake a particular type of study\nor consultation,” Ambat I, 693 F. Supp. 2d at 1138 (emphasis\nin original), and we are not arriving at a contrary holding.\nThat is to say, we are not concluding that the decision-making\nprocess supporting a discriminatory policy needs to take any\nparticular form. However, it is significant that the extent of\nthe Sheriff’s efforts to ensure that his judgment was the result\nof available information and experience contrasts sharply\n\f     ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             17\n\nwith the efforts undertaken by other officials implementing\nsimilar policies that have withstood Title VII challenges on\nBFOQ grounds. See, e.g., Robino, 145 F.3d at 1111 (“To\ncomply with an EEOC settlement, [corrections officials]\nconducted an extensive survey of post duties before\ndetermining which posts should be designated female-only.”);\nEverson, 391 F.3d at 741–45 (describing how three studies\nwere conducted, including one pursuant to a settlement with\nthe DOJ); cf. Torres, 859 F.2d at 1531–32 (holding that\nprison officials were required to “innovate” in order to serve\nthe rehabilitative interests of the female inmates, because\nempirical studies concerning the rehabilitation of female\ninmates “simply did not exist” at the time).\n\n    The district court appears to have granted the Sheriff’s\njudgment deference based primarily on his substantial\nqualifications, rather than on the characteristics of the\ndecision-making process itself. This reasoning is not\nconsistent with our precedent, which conditions deference on\nwhether the decision-making process itself was reasoned and\nwell-informed. See Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1214; Robino,\n145 F.3d at 1110. While we need not decide precisely how\n“reasoned” the decision-making process must be, nor how\nmuch of the “available information and experience” a\ncorrections official must consider before implementing a\nfacially discriminatory policy, the record before us now\nclearly exhibits a genuine dispute over whether the Policy\nresulted from a “reasoned decision-making process, based on\navailable information and experience.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at\n1214 (quoting Robino, 145 F.3d at 1110). Considering the\nevidence in the record in the light most favorable to the\nplaintiffs, as we must on the County’s motion for summary\njudgment, a trier of fact could conclude that the Sheriff’s\njudgment was not preceded by a decision-making process that\n\f18    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nwas sufficiently reasoned in proportion to the seriousness of\nimposing the Policy. Similarly, a trier of fact could also\nconclude that the seriousness of imposing the Policy required\nthe Sheriff to make a greater effort to avail himself of the\ninformation and experience readily available to him – such as\nby conducting relevant surveys or studies, as in Robino and\nEverson, or by consulting with officials in other jurisdictions\nwho had considered or implemented policies like the one he\nultimately implemented, as plaintiffs suggest.\n\n    Thus, because a trier of fact considering the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to plaintiffs could conclude that the\ndecision-making process was either insufficiently reasoned or\ninsufficiently based on available information and experience,\nthe County cannot meet its burden of showing that the\nSheriff’s judgment is entitled to deference as a matter of law,\nand the County may not rely on such deference in meeting its\nburden of showing that there are no genuine disputes of fact\nas to whether it can satisfy our two-step BFOQ inquiry.\n\n       2. Job Qualifications Reasonably Necessary to the\n          Essence of Operating San Francisco’s Jails\n\n    Although deference to the Sheriff’s judgment cannot play\na role in our analysis, it is still necessary for us to consider\neach rationale that has been offered by the County in order to\ndetermine whether the County is able to satisfy our BFOQ\ninquiry based solely on the evidence in the record. We must\nconsider each of the four rationales offered by the County in\norder to determine (1) whether any rationale suggests a job\nqualification reasonably necessary to the essence of operating\nSFSD’s jails, and, if so, (2) whether sex is a legitimate proxy\nfor determining whether a deputy actually has that\nqualification. Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1210.\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO                19\n\n    In considering each of the County’s rationales, the County\neasily meets its burden, as a matter of law, of demonstrating\nthat there are job qualifications derived from the four\njustifications that are reasonably necessary to the essence of\noperating SFSD’s jails. Each of the four justifications that\nthe Sheriff claims drove his decision to implement the Policy\n– protecting female inmates from sexual misconduct by male\ndeputies, maintaining jail security, protecting inmate privacy,\nand preserving the ability of female inmates to rehabilitate –\nis essential to the operation of a corrections facility and has\nbeen recognized as justifying facially discriminatory policies\nin other contexts. See Dothard, 433 U.S. at 335 (security);\nRobino, 145 F.3d at 1111 (safety, security, privacy,\nrehabilitation); Everson, 391 F.3d at 750 (safety, security,\nprivacy, rehabilitation).\n\n     Based on these important rationales for the Policy, we\nhave no difficulty in identifying four “job qualification[s] . . .\nreasonably necessary to the essence of” operating SFSD’s\njails, any of which would satisfy the first prong of our test.\nBreiner, 610 F.3d at 1210.               These qualifications\ncorresponding to the four rationales are (1) not posing a threat\nto the safety of female inmates due to a likelihood of\nperpetrating sexual misconduct against them; (2) not posing\na threat to jail security; (3) not posing a threat to female\ninmates’ privacy; and (4) not posing a threat to female\ninmates’ ability to rehabilitate. We now consider each of\nthese four qualifications under the second prong of our test to\ndetermine whether there is any genuine dispute of material\nfact as to whether being male is a “legitimate proxy” for any\nof them.\n\f20    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\n        3. Whether Sex Is a Legitimate Proxy for\n           Reasonably Necessary Job Qualifications\n\n    The County may show that excluding all male deputies is\na “legitimate proxy” for excluding deputies who lack one of\nthe four qualifications if there is (a) “a substantial basis for\nbelieving that all or nearly all [men] lack the qualification” or\n(b) “it is impossible or highly impractical . . . to insure by\nindividual testing” whether or not a male deputy has the\nqualification. Id. at 1210 (alteration in original). We also\nnote that it is impossible to satisfy the “legitimate proxy”\nprong if there is no “concrete, logical basis for concluding\nthat gender restrictions are ‘reasonably necessary,’” id. at\n1212, or if alternatives have not been reasonably considered\nand refuted, id. at 1216.\n\n    The County asserts that the primary reason for the\nSheriff’s adoption of the Policy was to protect the safety of\nfemale inmates by reducing the possibility of sexual\nharassment and abuse by male deputies. While there is no\nquestion that this is an extremely important interest, the\nCounty has not met its burden of showing that there is no\ngenuine dispute over whether excluding men from\nsupervisory positions in female housing units is a legitimate\nproxy for requiring that deputies in those positions not pose\na threat to the safety of female inmates. More specifically, at\nthis stage of the proceeding, the County has not shown that\nthe Sheriff had “a substantial basis for believing that all or\nnearly all” male deputies were likely to engage in sexual\nmisconduct with female inmates, nor has it shown that “it is\nimpossible or highly impractical . . . to insure by individual\ntesting” that a male deputy does not pose such a threat. Id. at\n1210.\n\f     ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             21\n\n    The statistics on sexual misconduct perpetrated by male\ndeputies against female inmates in SFSD’s jails are deeply\ntroubling. The record shows that in the five years preceding\nthe implementation of the Policy, ten allegations of sexual\nmisconduct were made; two more allegations were made the\nyear after the Policy was implemented. A substantial portion\nof these allegations were sustained or were followed by a\ndeputy’s resignation. We also accept that it is reasonable to\nassume, as the County argues, that other instances of\nmisconduct may have gone unreported.\n\n    Nevertheless, these statistics by themselves do not prove\nthat “all or substantially all” male deputies are likely to\nperpetrate sexual misconduct. To suggest that all or most\nmale deputies pose such a threat would amount to “the kind\nof unproven and invidious stereotype that Congress sought to\neliminate from employment decisions when it enacted Title\nVII.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1211.\n\n    On this record, the County is also unable to show that\nthere is no genuine dispute as to whether it is impossible or\nhighly impractical to insure by individual testing that a male\ndeputy does not have a propensity to perpetrate sexual\nmisconduct. We have observed that background checks,\nwhich all deputies must undergo, are among “prison\nadministrators[’] . . . multiple resources . . . to ensure\ncompliance with institutional rules.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at\n1215. As the County points out, peace officer candidates\nmust also undergo psychological examinations.\n\n    While conceding that background checks and\npsychological testing are used for the purpose of screening\nfor a propensity to perpetrate sexual misconduct, the County\nsuggests that such screening mechanisms are inadequate\n\f22    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nbecause they are unable to detect all potential perpetrators.\nRemoving every deputy with any potential for engaging in\nmisconduct may be a laudable goal, but that goal is\ninsufficient to justify a policy that discriminates in such broad\nstrokes. Rather, we have observed that a BFOQ defense\ncannot be maintained if available testing offers “a practical\nreliable differentiation of the unqualified from the qualified\napplicant, [even if it is] not a perfect differentiation.” See\nE.E.O.C. v. L.A. Cnty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418074\"><a href=\"/opinion/418074/31-fair-emplpraccas-1474-32-empl-prac-dec-p-33649-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1040, 1043 (9th Cir.\n1983) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The\nrecord before us does not resolve the genuine dispute over\nwhether the tests that are presently used or that could be used\nby SFSD would permit it to make a practical reliable\ndifferentiation between those who are likely to engage in\nsexual misconduct and those who are not.\n\n    The County also argues that employing male deputies in\nthe female housing pods poses a threat to jail security. In so\narguing, it points to two specific assertions offered by the\nSheriff. First, the Sheriff expressed concern that male\ndeputies were particularly vulnerable to manipulation by\nfemale inmates, potentially leading them to overlook conduct\nin violation of jail regulations, such as smuggling contraband\ninto the jail. Second, he claimed that the consequence of\nmale deputies’ fear of being accused of sexual misconduct\ncould be that those deputies would be unwilling to supervise\nfemale inmates as closely as necessary, leading to an even\ngreater risk of female inmates being able to violate jail rules.\n\n    However, the record on summary judgment is insufficient\nto demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute as to whether\n“all or substantially all” male deputies would be vulnerable\nto manipulation by female inmates or as to whether it would\nbe “impossible or highly impractical” to test for whether a\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             23\n\nmale deputy is manipulable. The County has introduced no\nevidence, even in the declarations of SFSD officials, that\nwould support this conclusion. Likewise, the County has\nfailed to demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute over\nwhether “all or substantially all” male deputies would be\ninfluenced by fear of false allegations, or over whether it\nwould be “impossible or highly impractical” to test for such\nbehavior. The Sheriff himself acknowledged that he has “no\nidea” how widespread this purported problem is. He also\nadmitted that he is unaware of whether any efforts were made\nwithin SFSD to explore non-discriminatory alternatives to the\nPolicy for the purpose of mitigating the potential effect of\nfalse allegations leveled at male deputies. Thus there is a\ngenuine question as to whether the County is able to “refute[]\nthe viability of [non-discriminatory] alternatives.” Breiner,\n610 F.3d at 1216.\n\n    The County’s third justification for the Policy is\nprotecting the privacy interests of female inmates. However,\nthe record does not demonstrate that there is an actual risk of\nfemale inmates’ privacy being compromised by male\ndeputies. SFSD has policies in place to prevent male deputies\nfrom taking on duties, such as strip searches, that might\nviolate the privacy of female inmates. The inmates are\nrequired to remain clothed at all times, except when\nshowering. When showering or using the toilet, inmates’\nbodies are covered by a privacy screen.\n\n    The Sheriff claims that the use of privacy screens\ncompromises jail security, but there is a genuine dispute as to\nwhether privacy screens actually do compromise jail security\nwhere, as here, the screens remained in use even after the\nPolicy was adopted. See Torres, 859 F.2d at 1526 (finding\nthat a BFOQ defense could not be sustained over privacy\n\f24    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nconcerns where “the [district] court noted that [corrections\nofficials] continued to allow [female] inmates to use privacy\ncards even after the BFOQ program [requiring female guards]\nhad been installed, thus rebutting the argument that the\npresence of male guards reduced observation of the\ninmates”).\n\n    The County’s final justification for the Policy is\npromoting the rehabilitation of female inmates. The Sheriff\nasserts that he was concerned that surveillance by male\ndeputies could traumatize female inmates, particularly those\nwho had suffered physical or sexual abuse in the past. The\nCounty introduced evidence that a disproportionately high\nnumber of female inmates had suffered such abuse.\nNevertheless, there is a genuine dispute over whether\nexcluding male deputies is a legitimate proxy for excluding\ndeputies who would interfere with female inmates’\nrehabilitation.\n\n    A “staffing restriction . . . must match . . . ‘job functions’\nwith a high degree of specificity to be found reasonably\nnecessary.” Breiner, 610 F.3d at 1213 (quoting Johnson\nControls, 499 U.S. at 202). In this situation, SFSD has\nseparated the functions of supervising the inmates in the\nhousing pods from the functions of providing rehabilitative\nprogramming to the inmates, such as through a high school\nprogram, support groups, and parenting classes. Further,\nthere is no evidence in the record that the individuals staffing\nthe rehabilitative programs, some of which are staffed by\nindependent contractors, are themselves required to be\nfemale. If female inmates were supervised by men in their\nrehabilitative programs while the Policy was in effect, that\nfact alone would defeat the County’s argument that excluding\nmen from supervisory roles was necessary to promote female\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             25\n\ninmates’ rehabilitation. See Henry, 539 F.3d at 582-83\n(“[I]nconsistencies in implementation cast a significant doubt\non whether the policy is reasonably necessary.”). As\nplaintiffs observe, there is also conflicting expert testimony\nover whether isolating female inmates from men might in fact\nimpede the inmates’ efforts at rehabilitation; for example,\nplaintiffs’ expert discussed research indicating that the\npresence of male officers might itself promote the\nrehabilitation of female inmates.\n\n   C. Conclusion\n\n    The justifications offered by the County in support of the\nPolicy each speak to extremely important concerns, and the\nSheriff is to be commended for his attention to the welfare of\nfemale inmates in San Francisco’s jails. However, the fact\nthat the Policy seeks to advance such important goals as\ninmate safety is not, by itself, sufficient to permit\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. When moving for\nsummary judgment, the County bears the heavy burden of\nshowing that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to\nwhether excluding male deputies because of their sex is a\nlegitimate substitute for excluding them because they are\nactually unfit to serve in the female housing pods. On the\nrecord before us, the County has not made such a showing.\n\n    Discrimination on the basis of sex is almost always\ndisfavored under Title VII. Thus, even in a correctional\nsetting, our test for whether an employer is entitled to a\nBFOQ defense – that is, whether an employer has shown that\ndiscrimination is “reasonably necessary,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(e)(1) – is purposefully difficult to satisfy. It is even more\ndifficult when an employer moves for summary judgment and\nso must show that there are no genuine disputes that would\n\f26    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\nprevent it from satisfying our two-step inquiry as a matter of\nlaw. While we do not reach the issue of whether the County\ncould ultimately prevail on plaintiffs’ discrimination claims,\nthe factual disputes in this case prevent the County from\nprevailing at this stage.\n\n     We are mindful that deference often plays a significant\nrole in allowing a defendant to meet its burden of proving that\nit is entitled to a BFOQ defense in the corrections context,\nand we do not downplay the importance of courts deferring\nto the judgment of officials like the Sheriff, who has\ntremendous experience and expertise with respect to all\naspects of operating San Francisco’s jails. But, again, such\ndeference is not automatic, no matter how extensive an\nofficial’s qualifications. A discriminatory employment policy\nis an extraordinary response to a workplace problem, and our\nprinciple of deferring to the judgments of corrections officials\nhas its roots in the expectation that officials have made\ncommensurate efforts to determine that a discriminatory\npolicy is a necessary response and the only viable response.\nThus, while we don’t presume to be able to second-guess an\nofficial’s judgment, we do require that such a judgment be\n“‘the product of a reasoned decision-making process, based\non available information and experience.’” Breiner, 610 F.3d\nat 1212 n.6 (quoting Robino, 145 F.3d at 1110).\n\n    We need not and do not reach a conclusion about whether\nthe Sheriff’s judgment was the result of such a reasoned\nprocess. However, on the record before us, we cannot find as\nmatter of law that the Policy resulted from such a process.\nTherefore, on summary judgment, the County may not rely\non deference to the Sheriff’s judgment in order to meet its\nburden of proving that it was entitled to a BFOQ defense. In\nthe absence of deference to the Sheriff’s judgment, the\n\f       ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO            27\n\nCounty is also unable to meet its burden of proving that there\nis no issue of material fact as to whether its policy of\nexcluding all male deputies from the female housing units is\na legitimate proxy for excluding only those deputies that truly\npose a threat to the important interests SFSD rightfully seeks\nto protect. The district court’s grant of summary judgment as\nto plaintiffs’ sex discrimination claims and other claims\npredicated thereon is REVERSED.\n\n    Because the district court denied plaintiffs’ summary\njudgment motion on the same grounds that it granted the\nCounty’s motion, the district court’s denial of summary\njudgment to plaintiffs on these same claims is VACATED.\nThis case is REMANDED for further proceedings on these\nclaims.\n\nIII.    Evidentiary Claims\n\n    Prior to the district court’s ruling on the parties’ cross-\nmotions for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ discrimination\nclaims, plaintiffs made numerous objections to evidence\noffered by the County in support of its motion – particularly\nto declarations submitted by SFSD officials. The district\ncourt overruled three of the objections; it did not explicitly\nrule on the remainder of the objections but relied on the\nchallenged evidence in its summary judgment order.\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court’s explicit and implicit\nevidentiary rulings in the County’s favor.\n\n    “We review the district court’s evidentiary decisions for\nabuse of discretion, and the appellant is . . . required to\nestablish that the error was prejudicial.” Allstate Ins. Co. v.\nHerron, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1110 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Because we reverse the district\n\f28    ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO\n\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment on plaintiffs’\ndiscrimination claims, plaintiffs cannot establish prejudice;\nplaintiffs will have the opportunity to challenge the district\ncourt’s evidentiary rulings if they are unsuccessful on\nremand. Plaintiffs’ evidentiary challenges are DISMISSED.\n\nIV.     Attorney’s Fees\n\n    In addition to their sex discrimination claims, plaintiffs\nfiled various retaliation claims, also under Title VII and\nFEHA. The district court granted summary judgment to the\nCounty as to all but three plaintiffs, and the County settled the\nremaining claims. Plaintiffs moved for attorney’s fees in the\namount of $127,447.26 for having settled these claims. After\nan in camera review of plaintiffs’ counsel’s time sheets, the\ndistrict court awarded $8,925 for “retaliation-specific work,”\nobserving that plaintiffs could not recover “fees for time\ndevoted to litigating the gender discrimination claims.”\nPlaintiffs contend on appeal that the fee award is not\ncommensurate with the extent of their success.\n\n     “[I]n a lawsuit where the plaintiff presents different\nclaims for relief that ‘involve a common core of facts’ or are\nbased on ‘related legal theories,’ the district court should not\nattempt to divide the request for attorney’s fees on a\nclaim-by-claim basis. Instead, the court must . . . ‘focus on\nthe significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff\nin relation to the hours reasonably expended on the\nlitigation.’” McCown v. City of Fontana, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1103 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting Hensley v.

In sum, “the district court should\nadequately explain the reasonable number of hours and\nhourly rate it uses in calculating the fee, and appropriately\nadjust the award to account for [a plaintiff’s] limited success\n\f      ANDERSON V. CITY & CNTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO             29\n\non claims and damages, and for any public benefit derived\nfrom his suit.” Id. at 1105.\n\n    The district court concluded that plaintiffs’ success was\nminor relative to the scope of the sex discrimination action,\nand it awarded fees accordingly.

Tidyman’s Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777187\"><a href=\"/opinion/777187/connie-hemmings-and-patty-lamphiear-v-tidymans-inc-a-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1200\n(9th Cir. 2002), we see no indication that the district court\nabused its discretion in making the award that it did. Under\nthe district court’s own reasoning, plaintiffs will be entitled\nto a substantially greater award if they are successful on\nremand. The district court’s award of attorney’s fees is\nAFFIRMED.\n\nV. Gray’s Retaliation Claims\n\n    John Gray was among the plaintiffs who claimed\nretaliation and against whom the district court granted\nsummary judgment; the district court was correct in its\njudgment. Gray disseminated defamatory statements about\nseveral individuals, amounting to what the SFSD deemed\n“[c]onduct, on or off duty, which reflects adversely on the\nSFSD.” As a result, he was terminated.
