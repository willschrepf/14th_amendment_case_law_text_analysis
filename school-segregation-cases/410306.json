Labatad sought damages and\ninjunctive relief based on an assault by a member of a rival\nprison gang, with whom he was temporarily assigned to share\na cell. The District Court rejected Labatad’s claims that the\ndefendants were deliberately indifferent to the risk he faced\n\f4     LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\nfrom the cell assignment. We have jurisdiction under\n8 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm.\n\n                               I.\n\n    Keone Labatad was a State of Hawaii inmate incarcerated\nat the SCC. Although the SCC tracks inmates’ gang\naffiliations, it does not have a policy of separating rival gang\nmembers in cell assignments. Instead, gang affiliation is one\nfactor in the case-by-case evaluations used to make such\nassignments.\n\n    On July 23, 2009, Labatad had a fight with another\ninmate, Howard Giddeons. Labatad was a member of the La\nFamilia gang, and Giddeons was a member of the USO\nFamily gang. The fight did not produce serious injuries. A\nguard noticed that Labatad’s face was swollen and scratched,\nand prison officials investigated. Both Labatad and Giddeons\ntold the investigators that the fight was not gang related.\nBoth said that they bumped against each other passing on the\nstairs, took offense, arranged to meet in Labatad’s cell, and\nfought. Both reported that after the fight, they shook hands\nand had no further issues.\n\n    Following usual practice, prison officials placed the\ninmates involved in the fight in administrative segregation\nduring the investigation. Labatad was assigned to share a cell\nwith Shane Mara, who, like Giddeons, was a member of the\nUSO Family gang. Labatad and Mara had known each other\nduring the extended period both were in general population\nat the SCC. There had been no difficulties between them.\nMara had not threatened Labatad and was not identified as\nsomeone who should be kept separate from Labatad or was\nlikely to do him harm.\n\f       LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA                     5\n\n    Three days later, Mara assaulted Labatad, punching him\nin the head and back. The assault occurred just after Labatad\nhad been placed in hand restraints in preparation for being\nescorted out of the cell. Guards waiting outside the cell door\nto escort Labatad promptly intervened. The doctor who\ntreated Labatad testified that he had a welt on his back and a\nbloody—but not broken—nose. Labatad asserts that his nose\nwas bent to the left and is still crooked.\n\n   Prison officials investigated the fight between Mara and\nLabatad. Mara told the investigators that he assaulted\nLabatad because he was a La Familia member and Mara\nthought that Labatad would attack unless he did so first.\n\n    Labatad sued the Corrections Corporation of America\n(CCA) and its regional operations director; the SCC warden,\nassistant warden, and chief of security; and Labatad’s SCC\nunit manager. Labatad alleged that the decision to house him\nin the same cell with a member of a rival gang after he had\nfought with another member of that same gang violated his\nEighth Amendment rights. Labatad challenged both the\ngeneral policy that allowed rival gang members to be housed\nin the same cell and the specific decision to place him in the\ncell with Mara. He sought $100,000 in damages and a\nchange in SCC policies to require separation of inmates by\ngang affiliation.1\n\n   After discovery, on August 19, 2011, the defendants\nmoved for summary judgment on two grounds: (1) Labatad\nhad failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he\nhad not filed a grievance for 15 months after the incident; and\n\n   1\n     Labatad has since been released, making his additional request for\ntransfer to a different facility moot.\n\f6     LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\n(2) the record showed that, as a matter of law, the defendants\nhad not acted with deliberate indifference in housing Labatad\nwith Mara. Labatad filed a detailed, thorough, and extensive\nresponse on September 14, 2011.\n\n    On September 15, 2011, the District Court sent Labatad\nthe notice required under Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d 952 (9th\nCir. 1998) (en banc). The notice did not acknowledge that\nLabatad had already responded to the summary judgment\nmotion. On October 3, 2011, the defendants filed a reply to\nLabatad’s response.\n\n    On December 14, 2011, the District Court issued its\ndecision. It declined to grant the motion on the basis of\nfailure to exhaust, noting that the court had not provided\nnotice addressing the defendants’ exhaustion arguments. See\nStratton v. Buck, 697 F.3d 1004, 1008 (9th Cir. 2012)\n(“[W]hen a district court will consider materials beyond the\npleadings in ruling upon a defendant’s motion to dismiss for\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies, the pro se prisoner\nplaintiff must receive a notice, similar to the notice described\nin Rand.”). The District Court granted the defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment on the merits of the Eighth\nAmendment claim. The court acknowledged that it had sent\nthe Rand notice after Labatad had already responded to the\nsummary judgment motion, but found that it was nonetheless\nproper to decide the motion on the merits.\n\n    The District Court rejected Labatad’s claim that by\nallowing rival gang members to be housed in a single cell, the\ndefendants committed a per se Eighth Amendment violation.\nThe District Court also found that the record evidence\nshowed that, as a matter of law, the defendants had not acted\nwith deliberate indifference in housing Labatad with Mara.\n\f      LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA               7\n\nIn reaching that conclusion, the District Court disregarded\nfour affidavits Labatad had submitted from other inmates\nstating that there had been other violent incidents between\nmembers of the La Familia and USO Family gangs housed in\nshared cells at the SCC. The District Court based this\ndecision on its conclusion that the affidavits did not show that\nthe affiants had personal knowledge of the events they\ndescribed.\n\n   This timely appeal followed.\n\n                              II.\n\n    The threshold issue is whether the District Court erred in\ndeciding the summary judgment motion despite its failure to\nsend the Rand notice until approximately a month after the\ndefendants filed their motion and a day after Labatad filed his\nresponse.\n\n     The purpose of the Rand notice is to give a pro se prisoner\nlitigant “fair notice” of the requirements and consequences of\nthe summary judgment rule because of the “complexity of\n[that] rule combined with the lack of legal sophistication of\nthe pro se prisoner.” Rand, 154 F.3d at 960. The notice must\n“apprise an unsophisticated prisoner of his . . . rights and\nobligations under Rule 56”; inform the prisoner of his “right\nto file counter-affidavits or other responsive evidentiary\nmaterials and be alerted to the fact that the failure to do so\nmight result in the entry of summary judgment against the\nprisoner”; and inform the prisoner of “the effect of losing on\nsummary judgment.” Id. (citations omitted). Our cases have\nemphasized the importance of having the notice sent at a time\nwhen it will effectively serve these purposes. In Woods v.\nCarey, 684 F.3d 934, 935 (9th Cir. 2012), we found that a\n\f8     LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\nRand notice sent too early in the litigation—in that case, over\na year before the Rule 56 motion was filed—was insufficient.\nWe emphasized that “the only satisfactory practice to ensure\nthat prisoners receive adequate notice pursuant to Rand . . . is\nto provide such notice at the time the relevant motions are\nfiled.” Id. at 940. The premature Rand notice was inadequate\nbecause it was “apt to be lost, forgotten, or rendered\ninaccessible by the time it becomes necessary for the litigant\nto marshal a response.” Id.\n\n     In this case, the notice was not sent too long before the\nsummary judgment motion was filed, but too long after. By\nthe time he received his Rand notice from the District Court,\nLabatad had already filed his response. The requirement that\nthe Rand notice be filed “at the time the relevant motions are\nfiled” means just that. The Rand notice must issue so that the\nlitigant will receive the motion and the notice reasonably\ncontemporaneously.\n\n    The delay in sending the Rand notice to Labatad was\nerror. The question is whether the District Court’s decision\nto decide the summary judgment motion despite that error\nrequires reversal and remand. We conclude it does not.\n\n    This court has held that “harmless error review is\ninappropriate in most cases” involving a failure to send a\ntimely Rand notice. Rand, 154 F.3d at 961. Such review\noften requires courts to engage in the “burdensome task of\nassessing each particular litigant’s sophistication in legal\nmatters,” including the “impossible task of attempting to\ndivine whether an individual inmate understood what was at\nstake if he failed to put all of his evidence before the court.”\nId. But in the “unusual case where the harmlessness of the\nfailure to give the required notice may be established on the\n\f      LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA             9\n\nrecord or by judicial notice,” harmless error review is\nappropriate. Id. at 961. In Rand, the court described an\nexample of such an unusual case as one in which an\n“objective examination of the record” discloses that the\nlitigant has a “complete understanding of Rule 56’s\nrequirements.” Id.\n\n     This is one of the unusual cases in which the record,\nobjectively examined, demonstrates the “harmlessness of the\nfailure to give the required notice.” Id. Labatad’s response\nto the summary judgment motion included his own detailed\ndeclaration thoroughly setting out his knowledge of the facts.\nIt included citations to, and quotes from, legal authorities,\nincluding Rule 56, and stated the Rule’s legal standard for\nsummary judgment. The response complied with the local-\nrule requirements by including a separate statement of\ndisputed facts identified to correspond to the defendants’\nstatement of facts supporting summary judgment. Labatad\nattached as exhibits, and cited from, materials the defendants\nhad provided in discovery, including excerpts from the\ndefendants’ responses to requests for admission and a CCA\nmemo on the limited role of gang affiliation in making inmate\nhousing assignments. Labatad also attached sworn affidavits\nby four inmates describing other instances of violence from\nrival gang members sharing a cell. Labatad’s response to the\ndefendants’ summary judgment motion fully complied with\nthe instructions in the Rand notice. The record, objectively\nviewed, shows that Labatad knew and understood the\ninformation in the Rand notice before he received it.\n\n    Labatad suggests that had he received an earlier Rand\nnotice or a later clear instruction that he could have\nsupplemented his response, he could have added to the\naffidavits from the four inmates. The District Court found\n\f10    LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\nthose affidavits incompetent as summary judgment evidence\nbecause they did not show the affiants’ personal knowledge.\nBut nothing in the Rand notice or in a statement of a right to\nsupplement would have given Labatad specific instructions\non what more the affidavits needed to make them competent\nevidence. The affidavits already stated that the affiants had\npersonal knowledge of what was described, showing\nLabatad’s prior awareness of the personal knowledge\nrequirement. And, as explained below, even if the affidavits\nare considered part of the summary judgment evidence, the\noutcome is unchanged.\n\n    Despite the late Rand notice, Labatad did not suffer a\ndeprivation of substantial rights when the District Court\ndecided the summary judgment motion on the merits. See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 61. His response demonstrates that he\nunderstood the nature of summary judgment and complied\nwith the requirements of Rule 56. Thus, reversal and remand\nof the District Court decision is not required.\n\n                             III.\n\n    The Eighth Amendment requires prison officials to take\nreasonable measures to guarantee the safety of inmates,\nwhich has been interpreted to include a duty to protect\nprisoners. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832–33 (1994);\nHearns v. Terhune, 413 F.3d 1036, 1040 (9th Cir. 2005). A\nprisoner seeking relief for an Eighth Amendment violation\nmust show that the officials acted with deliberate indifference\nto the threat of serious harm or injury to an inmate. Gibson\nv. County of Washoe, 290 F.3d 1175, 1187 (9th Cir. 2002).\n“Deliberate indifference” has both subjective and objective\ncomponents. A prison official must “be aware of facts from\nwhich the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\n\f      LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA             11\n\nserious harm exists, and . . . must also draw the inference.”\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837. Liability may follow only if a\nprison official “knows that inmates face a substantial risk of\nserious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take\nreasonable measures to abate it.” Id. at 847.\n\n    The District Court found that the SCC’s policy of\npermitting members of different gangs to be housed together\nwas not itself an Eighth Amendment violation. As the\nSeventh Circuit observed in a similar case, among other\nproblems, “[t]he number of gang members housed . . . and the\nhigh representation of certain gangs would place an\nunmanageable burden on prison administrators were they\nrequired to separate inmates by gangs.” Mayoral v. Sheahan,\n245 F.3d 934, 939 (7th Cir. 2001). At argument, Labatad’s\ncounsel clarified that he was not asserting a per se Eighth\nAmendment violation. Instead, he alleged that the defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent to the risk of harm from the cell\nassignment with Mara.\n\n    The record, viewed objectively and subjectively, is\ninsufficient to preclude summary judgment on the claim that\nSCC prison officials were deliberately indifferent to a\nsubstantial risk that Mara would assault Labatad if the two\nwere housed in the same cell. Mara and Labatad had been in\ngeneral population together for an extended period with no\nrecord of any threats or problems between them. Mara was\nnot listed as a “separatee” for Labatad. The added fact that\nLabatad had fought three days earlier with a member of\nMara’s gang is not a basis to find deliberate indifference.\nPrison officials had been assured by both Labatad and\nGiddeons that their fight was not gang related and that there\nwere no further issues between them. Labatad argues that\nthe record supports an inference of subjective awareness of\n\f12    LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\nthe risk because of his evidence that he told an SCC officer\nthat he should not be housed with Mara. But Labatad\nprovided no specifics about this conversation. Without more,\nsuch as information about who Labatad spoke to or what he\nsaid, we cannot infer that any of the defendants or officials\nresponsible for making the assignment were aware that\nLabatad faced a substantial risk of harm. See Wood v.\nBeauclair, 692 F.3d 1041, 1051 (9th Cir. 2012) (concluding\nthat prison supervisors lacked knowledge of the risk in part\nbecause the prisoner “never disclosed [the sexual abuser’s]\nactions to prison officials until long after the incidents at\nissue in this case occurred”). While the failure to give\nadvance notice of a specific threat is not dispositive, there is\nno other evidence in the record showing that the defendants\nknew of facts supporting an inference and drew the inference\nof a substantial risk to Labatad if he was placed in a cell with\nMara.\n\n    Moreover, consideration of the four inmate affidavits\nexcluded by the District Court would not have altered the\noutcome of this case. One of the affiants, a USO Family\nmember, states that he has been housed in administrative\nsegregation with La Familia members, but he does not say\nwhether those housing assignments resulted in violent\nincidents. Two of the affidavits describe an assault that\noccurred after Labatad was attacked by Mara, making them\nirrelevant to show the defendants’ awareness of a substantial\nrisk of housing Labatad with Mara. Although the affidavits\nmention two assaults before Labatad’s incident with Mara,\nwithout context and with no apparent connection to Labatad\nand Mara aside from the gang affiliations of the respective\nparticipants, they, too, are insufficient to show deliberate\nindifference.\n\f      LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA           13\n\n                            IV.\n\n    The undisputed evidence in the record shows that the\ndefendants were not deliberately indifferent to a substantial\nrisk of an attack if Mara and Labatad were placed in a cell\ntogether. The District Court properly granted the defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n   We AFFIRM.\n\f",

Labatad sought damages and\ninjunctive relief based on an assault by a member of a rival\nprison gang, with whom he was temporarily assigned to share\na cell. The District Court rejected Labatad’s claims that the\ndefendants were deliberately indifferent to the risk he faced\n\f4     LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\nfrom the cell assignment. We have jurisdiction under\n8 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm.\n\n                               I.\n\n    Keone Labatad was a State of Hawaii inmate incarcerated\nat the SCC. Although the SCC tracks inmates’ gang\naffiliations, it does not have a policy of separating rival gang\nmembers in cell assignments. Instead, gang affiliation is one\nfactor in the case-by-case evaluations used to make such\nassignments.\n\n    On July 23, 2009, Labatad had a fight with another\ninmate, Howard Giddeons. Labatad was a member of the La\nFamilia gang, and Giddeons was a member of the USO\nFamily gang. The fight did not produce serious injuries. A\nguard noticed that Labatad’s face was swollen and scratched,\nand prison officials investigated. Both Labatad and Giddeons\ntold the investigators that the fight was not gang related.\nBoth said that they bumped against each other passing on the\nstairs, took offense, arranged to meet in Labatad’s cell, and\nfought. Both reported that after the fight, they shook hands\nand had no further issues.\n\n    Following usual practice, prison officials placed the\ninmates involved in the fight in administrative segregation\nduring the investigation. Labatad was assigned to share a cell\nwith Shane Mara, who, like Giddeons, was a member of the\nUSO Family gang. Labatad and Mara had known each other\nduring the extended period both were in general population\nat the SCC. There had been no difficulties between them.\nMara had not threatened Labatad and was not identified as\nsomeone who should be kept separate from Labatad or was\nlikely to do him harm.\n\f       LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA                     5\n\n    Three days later, Mara assaulted Labatad, punching him\nin the head and back. The assault occurred just after Labatad\nhad been placed in hand restraints in preparation for being\nescorted out of the cell. Guards waiting outside the cell door\nto escort Labatad promptly intervened. The doctor who\ntreated Labatad testified that he had a welt on his back and a\nbloody—but not broken—nose. Labatad asserts that his nose\nwas bent to the left and is still crooked.\n\n   Prison officials investigated the fight between Mara and\nLabatad. Mara told the investigators that he assaulted\nLabatad because he was a La Familia member and Mara\nthought that Labatad would attack unless he did so first.\n\n    Labatad sued the Corrections Corporation of America\n(CCA) and its regional operations director; the SCC warden,\nassistant warden, and chief of security; and Labatad’s SCC\nunit manager. Labatad alleged that the decision to house him\nin the same cell with a member of a rival gang after he had\nfought with another member of that same gang violated his\nEighth Amendment rights. Labatad challenged both the\ngeneral policy that allowed rival gang members to be housed\nin the same cell and the specific decision to place him in the\ncell with Mara. He sought $100,000 in damages and a\nchange in SCC policies to require separation of inmates by\ngang affiliation.1\n\n   After discovery, on August 19, 2011, the defendants\nmoved for summary judgment on two grounds: (1) Labatad\nhad failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he\nhad not filed a grievance for 15 months after the incident; and\n\n   1\n     Labatad has since been released, making his additional request for\ntransfer to a different facility moot.\n\f6     LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\n(2) the record showed that, as a matter of law, the defendants\nhad not acted with deliberate indifference in housing Labatad\nwith Mara. Labatad filed a detailed, thorough, and extensive\nresponse on September 14, 2011.\n\n    On September 15, 2011, the District Court sent Labatad\nthe notice required under Rand v. Rowland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757675\"><a href=\"/opinion/757675/lee-a-rand-v-james-rowland-nadim-khoury-md-william-bunnell-roy-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\nCir. 1998) (en banc). The notice did not acknowledge that\nLabatad had already responded to the summary judgment\nmotion. On October 3, 2011, the defendants filed a reply to\nLabatad’s response.\n\n    On December 14, 2011, the District Court issued its\ndecision. It declined to grant the motion on the basis of\nfailure to exhaust, noting that the court had not provided\nnotice addressing the defendants’ exhaustion arguments. See\nStratton v. Buck, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1008 (9th Cir. 2012)\n(“[W]hen a district court will consider materials beyond the\npleadings in ruling upon a defendant’s motion to dismiss for\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies, the pro se prisoner\nplaintiff must receive a notice, similar to the notice described\nin Rand.”). The District Court granted the defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment on the merits of the Eighth\nAmendment claim. The court acknowledged that it had sent\nthe Rand notice after Labatad had already responded to the\nsummary judgment motion, but found that it was nonetheless\nproper to decide the motion on the merits.\n\n    The District Court rejected Labatad’s claim that by\nallowing rival gang members to be housed in a single cell, the\ndefendants committed a per se Eighth Amendment violation.\nThe District Court also found that the record evidence\nshowed that, as a matter of law, the defendants had not acted\nwith deliberate indifference in housing Labatad with Mara.\n\f      LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA               7\n\nIn reaching that conclusion, the District Court disregarded\nfour affidavits Labatad had submitted from other inmates\nstating that there had been other violent incidents between\nmembers of the La Familia and USO Family gangs housed in\nshared cells at the SCC. The District Court based this\ndecision on its conclusion that the affidavits did not show that\nthe affiants had personal knowledge of the events they\ndescribed.\n\n   This timely appeal followed.\n\n                              II.\n\n    The threshold issue is whether the District Court erred in\ndeciding the summary judgment motion despite its failure to\nsend the Rand notice until approximately a month after the\ndefendants filed their motion and a day after Labatad filed his\nresponse.\n\n     The purpose of the Rand notice is to give a pro se prisoner\nlitigant “fair notice” of the requirements and consequences of\nthe summary judgment rule because of the “complexity of\n[that] rule combined with the lack of legal sophistication of\nthe pro se prisoner.” Rand, 154 F.3d at 960. The notice must\n“apprise an unsophisticated prisoner of his . . . rights and\nobligations under Rule 56”; inform the prisoner of his “right\nto file counter-affidavits or other responsive evidentiary\nmaterials and be alerted to the fact that the failure to do so\nmight result in the entry of summary judgment against the\nprisoner”; and inform the prisoner of “the effect of losing on\nsummary judgment.” Id. (citations omitted). Our cases have\nemphasized the importance of having the notice sent at a time\nwhen it will effectively serve these purposes. In Woods v.\nCarey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935 (9th Cir. 2012), we found that a\n\f8     LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\nRand notice sent too early in the litigation—in that case, over\na year before the Rule 56 motion was filed—was insufficient.\nWe emphasized that “the only satisfactory practice to ensure\nthat prisoners receive adequate notice pursuant to Rand . . . is\nto provide such notice at the time the relevant motions are\nfiled.” Id. at 940. The premature Rand notice was inadequate\nbecause it was “apt to be lost, forgotten, or rendered\ninaccessible by the time it becomes necessary for the litigant\nto marshal a response.” Id.\n\n     In this case, the notice was not sent too long before the\nsummary judgment motion was filed, but too long after. By\nthe time he received his Rand notice from the District Court,\nLabatad had already filed his response. The requirement that\nthe Rand notice be filed “at the time the relevant motions are\nfiled” means just that. The Rand notice must issue so that the\nlitigant will receive the motion and the notice reasonably\ncontemporaneously.\n\n    The delay in sending the Rand notice to Labatad was\nerror. The question is whether the District Court’s decision\nto decide the summary judgment motion despite that error\nrequires reversal and remand. We conclude it does not.\n\n    This court has held that “harmless error review is\ninappropriate in most cases” involving a failure to send a\ntimely Rand notice. Rand, 154 F.3d at 961. Such review\noften requires courts to engage in the “burdensome task of\nassessing each particular litigant’s sophistication in legal\nmatters,” including the “impossible task of attempting to\ndivine whether an individual inmate understood what was at\nstake if he failed to put all of his evidence before the court.”\nId. But in the “unusual case where the harmlessness of the\nfailure to give the required notice may be established on the\n\f      LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA             9\n\nrecord or by judicial notice,” harmless error review is\nappropriate. Id. at 961. In Rand, the court described an\nexample of such an unusual case as one in which an\n“objective examination of the record” discloses that the\nlitigant has a “complete understanding of Rule 56’s\nrequirements.” Id.\n\n     This is one of the unusual cases in which the record,\nobjectively examined, demonstrates the “harmlessness of the\nfailure to give the required notice.” Id. Labatad’s response\nto the summary judgment motion included his own detailed\ndeclaration thoroughly setting out his knowledge of the facts.\nIt included citations to, and quotes from, legal authorities,\nincluding Rule 56, and stated the Rule’s legal standard for\nsummary judgment. The response complied with the local-\nrule requirements by including a separate statement of\ndisputed facts identified to correspond to the defendants’\nstatement of facts supporting summary judgment. Labatad\nattached as exhibits, and cited from, materials the defendants\nhad provided in discovery, including excerpts from the\ndefendants’ responses to requests for admission and a CCA\nmemo on the limited role of gang affiliation in making inmate\nhousing assignments. Labatad also attached sworn affidavits\nby four inmates describing other instances of violence from\nrival gang members sharing a cell. Labatad’s response to the\ndefendants’ summary judgment motion fully complied with\nthe instructions in the Rand notice. The record, objectively\nviewed, shows that Labatad knew and understood the\ninformation in the Rand notice before he received it.\n\n    Labatad suggests that had he received an earlier Rand\nnotice or a later clear instruction that he could have\nsupplemented his response, he could have added to the\naffidavits from the four inmates. The District Court found\n\f10    LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\nthose affidavits incompetent as summary judgment evidence\nbecause they did not show the affiants’ personal knowledge.\nBut nothing in the Rand notice or in a statement of a right to\nsupplement would have given Labatad specific instructions\non what more the affidavits needed to make them competent\nevidence. The affidavits already stated that the affiants had\npersonal knowledge of what was described, showing\nLabatad’s prior awareness of the personal knowledge\nrequirement. And, as explained below, even if the affidavits\nare considered part of the summary judgment evidence, the\noutcome is unchanged.\n\n    Despite the late Rand notice, Labatad did not suffer a\ndeprivation of substantial rights when the District Court\ndecided the summary judgment motion on the merits. See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 61. His response demonstrates that he\nunderstood the nature of summary judgment and complied\nwith the requirements of Rule 56. Thus, reversal and remand\nof the District Court decision is not required.\n\n                             III.\n\n    The Eighth Amendment requires prison officials to take\nreasonable measures to guarantee the safety of inmates,\nwhich has been interpreted to include a duty to protect\nprisoners. Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832–33 (1994);\nHearns v.

A\nprisoner seeking relief for an Eighth Amendment violation\nmust show that the officials acted with deliberate indifference\nto the threat of serious harm or injury to an inmate. Gibson\nv. County of Washoe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777732\"><a href=\"/opinion/777732/gibson-v-county-of-washoe-nevada/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1187 (9th Cir. 2002).\n“Deliberate indifference” has both subjective and objective\ncomponents. A prison official must “be aware of facts from\nwhich the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\n\f      LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA             11\n\nserious harm exists, and . . . must also draw the inference.”\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837. Liability may follow only if a\nprison official “knows that inmates face a substantial risk of\nserious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take\nreasonable measures to abate it.” Id. at 847.\n\n    The District Court found that the SCC’s policy of\npermitting members of different gangs to be housed together\nwas not itself an Eighth Amendment violation. As the\nSeventh Circuit observed in a similar case, among other\nproblems, “[t]he number of gang members housed . . . and the\nhigh representation of certain gangs would place an\nunmanageable burden on prison administrators were they\nrequired to separate inmates by gangs.” Mayoral v. Sheahan,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772739\"><a href=\"/opinion/772739/joel-mayoral-v-michael-f-sheahan-in-his-official-capacity-as-sheriff-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 939 (7th Cir. 2001). At argument, Labatad’s\ncounsel clarified that he was not asserting a per se Eighth\nAmendment violation. Instead, he alleged that the defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent to the risk of harm from the cell\nassignment with Mara.\n\n    The record, viewed objectively and subjectively, is\ninsufficient to preclude summary judgment on the claim that\nSCC prison officials were deliberately indifferent to a\nsubstantial risk that Mara would assault Labatad if the two\nwere housed in the same cell. Mara and Labatad had been in\ngeneral population together for an extended period with no\nrecord of any threats or problems between them. Mara was\nnot listed as a “separatee” for Labatad. The added fact that\nLabatad had fought three days earlier with a member of\nMara’s gang is not a basis to find deliberate indifference.\nPrison officials had been assured by both Labatad and\nGiddeons that their fight was not gang related and that there\nwere no further issues between them. Labatad argues that\nthe record supports an inference of subjective awareness of\n\f12    LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA\n\nthe risk because of his evidence that he told an SCC officer\nthat he should not be housed with Mara. But Labatad\nprovided no specifics about this conversation. Without more,\nsuch as information about who Labatad spoke to or what he\nsaid, we cannot infer that any of the defendants or officials\nresponsible for making the assignment were aware that\nLabatad faced a substantial risk of harm. See Wood v.\nBeauclair, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1041</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1051 (9th Cir. 2012) (concluding\nthat prison supervisors lacked knowledge of the risk in part\nbecause the prisoner “never disclosed [the sexual abuser’s]\nactions to prison officials until long after the incidents at\nissue in this case occurred”). While the failure to give\nadvance notice of a specific threat is not dispositive, there is\nno other evidence in the record showing that the defendants\nknew of facts supporting an inference and drew the inference\nof a substantial risk to Labatad if he was placed in a cell with\nMara.\n\n    Moreover, consideration of the four inmate affidavits\nexcluded by the District Court would not have altered the\noutcome of this case. One of the affiants, a USO Family\nmember, states that he has been housed in administrative\nsegregation with La Familia members, but he does not say\nwhether those housing assignments resulted in violent\nincidents. Two of the affidavits describe an assault that\noccurred after Labatad was attacked by Mara, making them\nirrelevant to show the defendants’ awareness of a substantial\nrisk of housing Labatad with Mara. Although the affidavits\nmention two assaults before Labatad’s incident with Mara,\nwithout context and with no apparent connection to Labatad\nand Mara aside from the gang affiliations of the respective\nparticipants, they, too, are insufficient to show deliberate\nindifference.\n\f      LABATAD V . CORRECTIONS CORP . OF AMERICA           13\n\n                            IV.\n\n    The undisputed evidence in the record shows that the\ndefendants were not deliberately indifferent to a substantial\nrisk of an attack if Mara and Labatad were placed in a cell\ntogether. The District Court properly granted the defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n   We AFFIRM.\n\f</pre>",
