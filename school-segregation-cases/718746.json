The original HEW student assignment plan for the Kemper County School District was first modified by the Appellate Court on January 2, 1970.  Because these modifications, as implemented, resulted in an all black attendance at four of the district's five schools, with a drop in attendance of nearly 1100 students, both black and white, from a total attendance of 2853, the school board again sought relief from the Appellate Court, which, by its order dated February 10, 1970, referred the board's motion to this Court to make recommendations for the balance of the 1969-70 school year.  A hearing was had on February 24, 1970, and over the objections of the government this Court on February 27, 1970, recommended the acceptance, for the most part, of the board's requested modifications.  On March 18, 1970, the Appellate Court adopted in part and rejected in part these recommendations.  The school board undertook to implement the assignment plan, as twice modified by the Appellate Court, the assignments and attendance as reflected by school enrollment reports, being as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <pre>                           STUDENT ATTENDANCE\n School    Capacity     Grades    W     N     T\nDeKalb        810        1-12    202   100   302\nWhisenton    1530        1-9\n                        11-12      0  1106  1106\nScooba        330        1-8      64    62   126\nSpencer       750        1-12      0   645   645\nLynville      (closed)\n                                ----  ----  ----\n        TOTAL                    266  1913  2179</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Under this plan the tenth grade from Whisenton was assigned to DeKalb; from Whisenton one class each class period was transported to DeKalb, and from DeKalb one class each class period was transported to Whisenton.  In the Scooba-Spencer school zone, 89 negroes from Spencer were assigned to Scooba; sixth grade math classes from Scooba and Spencer were taught at Spencer, and eighth grade English classes from Spencer and Scooba were taught at Scooba.  Attendance figures shown above are those reflected in the school board's enrollment report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 29, 1970, the Appellate Court directed this Court to conduct a full hearing on a motion and affidavits filed by the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., seeking an order adjudging the Kemper County school board in civil contempt of the aforesaid orders of November 7, 1969, January 2, 1970 and March 18, 1970 and on the board's answer and supporting affidavits.  Prior to a hearing on the civil contempt charges, the government filed a motion alleging that the plan as implemented by the board had failed to desegregate the schools in that the school attendance report filed with the Appellate Court reflected that, except for the 10th grade at DeKalb and the 1st and 2nd grades at Scooba, all students in the school system remained in segregated schools.  The government in its motion requested that the Court require the defendant school board to seek the assistance of the Office of Education, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, in the development of a new plan of student desegregation for the 1970-71 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 1970, this Court held a full hearing on the contempt charges, with all parties present.  The thrust of the charges was that the classes interchanged between DeKalb and Whisenton and between Scooba and Spencer remained segregated throughout the shuttle transportation and instructional time, that bus transportation otherwise remained segregated and the faculty ratio was not maintained.  The board admitted these charges and denied others.  By way of mitigation, the board pointed out that, following the order of March 18, 1970, only seven weeks remained in the school term in which to carry out the student assignment plan, as twice modified, and that the board did the best it could.  Testimony was offered to show that the courses of study in the classes exchanged between the two sets of schools were not correlated in the sense of all classes having covered the same material, and to have integrated the classes would have caused some students to suffer at the expense of others.  The lack of a proper faculty ratio was attributed to teacher resignations.  The board's position was that the plan was successful in that nearly 400 of the drop-out students, black and white, returned after its implementation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the hearing a conference was had in chambers with all parties present, and, in response to the government's aforesaid motion for a new plan, the school board was directed to seek assistance of a consultant staff of the Mississippi Educational Service Center, State College, Mississippi, in formulating a new student assignment plan.  Mr. Tom J. Richey, with assistance of others from this center, after visiting all schools in the district and consulting with the school superintendent on August 3 and 7, 1970, formulated a plan filed herein on August 26, 1970.  The school board refused to accept the plan proposed by the Mississippi Educational Service Center and filed its own plan.  As the opening of this school system for the year 1970-71 has been delayed from its original opening date of August 24, 1970, this Court called for an emergency conference of all parties on September 3, 1970.  This conference failed to produce an agreed upon plan.  All parties being present, including the members of the school board and their counsel, and the board having waived formal notice and having consented to an immediate hearing, the Court proceeded with a hearing on the two plans before it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan offered by the school board calls for the same grade assignments to all schools as provided in the last Appellate Court plan, set out above, with the additional provision that all tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade students enrolled in vocational agriculture would be assigned to the new vocationaltechnical center in integrated classes.  It additionally provides that one class each class period be transported daily from DeKalb to Whisenton for instruction in specified courses to be taught by negro teachers in integrated classes, and that one class each class period be transported daily from Whisenton to DeKalb to be taught in integrated classes by white teachers.  It additionally provided for a unified athletic program for grades 9 to 12 at the DeKalb and Whisenton schools.  The Court, mindful of the repeated difficulties of this board in implementing any plan to successfully eliminate the effects of a dual school system with a racial ratio of 82% Black and 18% White, as exists here, has carefully considered the board's proposal, and finds, as contended by the board, that, while more integration has occurred under the last currently implemented plan, nonetheless, two schools, Whisenton and Spencer, out of four, remained all black, and the provisions of the added proposals do not alter the fact that the students in this school system would still attend segregated schools under what is in effect a freedom of choice plan, partially desegregated under a course-exchange program, and with a faculty assignment that does not conform to the Singleton requirements.  Such a plan is not acceptable under the decisions of the Fifth Circuit, and this Court cannot recommend it.  See U.S.A. v. Board of Education of Webster County, Georgia, 431 F.2d 59 (5th Cir., July 7, 1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan prepared by the Mississippi Educational Service Center, offered by the Government, provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <pre>                                  PROJECTED ENROLLMENT\n School          Capacity  Grades         W     N        T\nWhisenton          1530     1-5,        118    809      927\n                           10-12\nDeKalb              810     6-9          64    397      461\nSpencer             750     1-5,         65    523      588\n                            9-12\nScooba              330     6-8          19    184      203\nJohn C.

He stated that his staff followed the guidelines set forth in the Singleton requirements.  They visited each school, and determined upon the pairing arrangement in two zones according to the suitability and capacities of the respective schools, and according to the last enrollment figures reported by the school board.  An amended metes and bounds description of the line between the two zones has been made a part of the plan filed herein as an exhibit.  This Court has no alternative but to recommend the approval of the Richey plan with two changes in grade assignments.  The Richey plan would assign grades 1-5 and 9-12 in the Spencer-Scooba zone to Spencer and split off grades 6-8 to Scooba.  Similarly in the DeKalb-Whisenton zone it would assign grades 1-5 and 10-12 to Whisenton and split off grades 6-9 to DeKalb.  The Court finds no compelling reasons for this unusual arrangement of grades which, in effect, creates a middle school.  Having examined the building information supplied as part of the plan, the Court on its own initiative recommends that the Richey plan be amended to assign students in the DeKalbWhisenton zone in grades 1-5 to DeKalb and in grades 6-12 to Whisenton, and in the Scooba-Spencer zone, students in grades 1-4 to Scooba, and grades 5-12 to Spencer.  The building space is adequate for these assignments, and a continuity of grades is preserved without affecting the racial composition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the contempt hearing, this Court finds that the admitted failures of the school board to comply in all particulars with the previously approved plan were not wilful, and, in view of the impending approval of a new student assignment plan, the charges have become moot and should be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court so recommends and directs the Clerk of this Court to file the original of this Findings of Fact and Recommendations with the Clerk of the Appellate Court, along with the original Richey plan together with the amended description of the zone boundary, file a duplicate copy of the Findings of Fact and Recommendations in his office, and mail a copy to all parties of record, attaching thereto the amended zone line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Signed) DAN M.

Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., seeking an order adjudging the Kemper County school board in civil contempt of the aforesaid orders of November 7, 1969, January 2, 1970 and March 18, 1970 and on the board's answer and supporting affidavits.  Prior to a hearing on the civil contempt charges, the government filed a motion alleging that the plan as implemented by the board had failed to desegregate the schools in that the school attendance report filed with the Appellate Court reflected that, except for the 10th grade at DeKalb and the 1st and 2nd grades at Scooba, all students in the school system remained in segregated schools.  The government in its motion requested that the Court require the defendant school board to seek the assistance of the Office of Education, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, in the development of a new plan of student desegregation for the 1970-71 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 1970, this Court held a full hearing on the contempt charges, with all parties present.  The thrust of the charges was that the classes interchanged between DeKalb and Whisenton and between Scooba and Spencer remained segregated throughout the shuttle transportation and instructional time, that bus transportation otherwise remained segregated and the faculty ratio was not maintained.  The board admitted these charges and denied others.  By way of mitigation, the board pointed out that, following the order of March 18, 1970, only seven weeks remained in the school term in which to carry out the student assignment plan, as twice modified, and that the board did the best it could.  Testimony was offered to show that the courses of study in the classes exchanged between the two sets of schools were not correlated in the sense of all classes having covered the same material, and to have integrated the classes would have caused some students to suffer at the expense of others.  The lack of a proper faculty ratio was attributed to teacher resignations.  The board's position was that the plan was successful in that nearly 400 of the drop-out students, black and white, returned after its implementation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the hearing a conference was had in chambers with all parties present, and, in response to the government's aforesaid motion for a new plan, the school board was directed to seek assistance of a consultant staff of the Mississippi Educational Service Center, State College, Mississippi, in formulating a new student assignment plan.  Mr. Tom J. Richey, with assistance of others from this center, after visiting all schools in the district and consulting with the school superintendent on August 3 and 7, 1970, formulated a plan filed herein on August 26, 1970.  The school board refused to accept the plan proposed by the Mississippi Educational Service Center and filed its own plan.  As the opening of this school system for the year 1970-71 has been delayed from its original opening date of August 24, 1970, this Court called for an emergency conference of all parties on September 3, 1970.  This conference failed to produce an agreed upon plan.  All parties being present, including the members of the school board and their counsel, and the board having waived formal notice and having consented to an immediate hearing, the Court proceeded with a hearing on the two plans before it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan offered by the school board calls for the same grade assignments to all schools as provided in the last Appellate Court plan, set out above, with the additional provision that all tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade students enrolled in vocational agriculture would be assigned to the new vocationaltechnical center in integrated classes.  It additionally provides that one class each class period be transported daily from DeKalb to Whisenton for instruction in specified courses to be taught by negro teachers in integrated classes, and that one class each class period be transported daily from Whisenton to DeKalb to be taught in integrated classes by white teachers.  It additionally provided for a unified athletic program for grades 9 to 12 at the DeKalb and Whisenton schools.  The Court, mindful of the repeated difficulties of this board in implementing any plan to successfully eliminate the effects of a dual school system with a racial ratio of 82% Black and 18% White, as exists here, has carefully considered the board's proposal, and finds, as contended by the board, that, while more integration has occurred under the last currently implemented plan, nonetheless, two schools, Whisenton and Spencer, out of four, remained all black, and the provisions of the added proposals do not alter the fact that the students in this school system would still attend segregated schools under what is in effect a freedom of choice plan, partially desegregated under a course-exchange program, and with a faculty assignment that does not conform to the Singleton requirements.  Such a plan is not acceptable under the decisions of the Fifth Circuit, and this Court cannot recommend it.  See U.S.A. v. Board of Education of Webster County, Georgia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"291889\"><a href=\"/opinion/291889/united-states-v-the-board-of-education-of-webster-county-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span> (5th Cir., July 7, 1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan prepared by the Mississippi Educational Service Center, offered by the Government, provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <pre>                                  PROJECTED ENROLLMENT\n School          Capacity  Grades         W     N        T\nWhisenton          1530     1-5,        118    809      927\n                           10-12\nDeKalb              810     6-9          64    397      461\nSpencer             750     1-5,         65    523      588\n                            9-12\nScooba              330     6-8          19    184      203\nJohn C.

He stated that his staff followed the guidelines set forth in the Singleton requirements.  They visited each school, and determined upon the pairing arrangement in two zones according to the suitability and capacities of the respective schools, and according to the last enrollment figures reported by the school board.  An amended metes and bounds description of the line between the two zones has been made a part of the plan filed herein as an exhibit.  This Court has no alternative but to recommend the approval of the Richey plan with two changes in grade assignments.  The Richey plan would assign grades 1-5 and 9-12 in the Spencer-Scooba zone to Spencer and split off grades 6-8 to Scooba.  Similarly in the DeKalb-Whisenton zone it would assign grades 1-5 and 10-12 to Whisenton and split off grades 6-9 to DeKalb.  The Court finds no compelling reasons for this unusual arrangement of grades which, in effect, creates a middle school.  Having examined the building information supplied as part of the plan, the Court on its own initiative recommends that the Richey plan be amended to assign students in the DeKalbWhisenton zone in grades 1-5 to DeKalb and in grades 6-12 to Whisenton, and in the Scooba-Spencer zone, students in grades 1-4 to Scooba, and grades 5-12 to Spencer.  The building space is adequate for these assignments, and a continuity of grades is preserved without affecting the racial composition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the contempt hearing, this Court finds that the admitted failures of the school board to comply in all particulars with the previously approved plan were not wilful, and, in view of the impending approval of a new student assignment plan, the charges have become moot and should be dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court so recommends and directs the Clerk of this Court to file the original of this Findings of Fact and Recommendations with the Clerk of the Appellate Court, along with the original Richey plan together with the amended description of the zone boundary, file a duplicate copy of the Findings of Fact and Recommendations in his office, and mail a copy to all parties of record, attaching thereto the amended zone line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Signed) DAN M.
