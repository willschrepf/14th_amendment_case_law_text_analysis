INTRODUCTION\n         Defendant Hector Rodriguez Contreras pleaded no contest to felony possession of\na controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)). The trial court\nsuspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation. While defendant\nwas on probation, Penal Code section 1170.181 was enacted by the voters as part of\nProposition 47, which reclassified certain offenses as misdemeanors. Defendant filed an\napplication in the trial court under section 1170.18, subdivision (f) to have his felony\nconviction designated a misdemeanor. The court denied the petition without prejudice\npursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n\n\n\n\n         1\n             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\f       On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to automatically\ndesignate his felony conviction a misdemeanor. Defendant contends that the ameliorative\nprovisions of Proposition 47 in reclassifying certain offenses as misdemeanors applied\nretroactively to him, and that he was not required to follow the procedures for recall and\nresentencing set forth in section 1170.18 in order to have his offense designated a\nmisdemeanor.\n       For reasons that we will explain, we will affirm the order.\n                 II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In June 2013, defendant was charged by complaint with two counts pertaining to a\ncontrolled substance and paraphernalia. In July 2013, the complaint was amended to add\ncount 3, felony possession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code,\n§ 11377, subd. (a)), and defendant pleaded no contest to that count. The trial court\nsuspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on Proposition 36 probation for\n18 months (see § 1210.1). The remaining counts were dismissed.\n       In October 2013, defendant was found in violation of probation and probation was\nrevoked. Thereafter, in November 2013, the trial court terminated defendant’s\nProposition 36 probation and placed him on formal probation for three years.2\n       In April and in May 2014, defendant admitted violating probation. Probation was\nrevoked and reinstated each time.\n       In March 2015, after Proposition 47 had passed, defendant filed an application\nrequesting that his felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance be\ndesignated a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivisions (f) and (g). In the\n\n\n\n       2\n        The judgment (order of probation) was the subject of defendant’s prior appeal\n(People v. Contreras (Jun. 10, 2015, H040402) [nonpub. opn.]). This court ultimately\naffirmed the judgment. In the present appeal, defendant refers to portions of the record in\ncase No. H040402. On our own motion, we take judicial notice of the record in that case.\n(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).)\n\n                                             2\n\fapplication, which was on a preprinted form, defendant marked a box indicating that he\nhad “completed” his “sentence.” He left unmarked a box indicating that he was currently\nserving a sentence.\n       In April 2015, the prosecution filed a response, contending that defendant was\n“not eligible for the requested relief” because he “ha[d] not been sentenced.”\n       A hearing was held on the matter on May 27, 2015. The trial court indicated that\nthe “same issue” had been taken up in a “previous case” before the court. The court\nexplained that, in felony probation cases, “[t]he way we’ve been handling these in this\ndepartment is that, essentially, he can ask to be sentenced but that may trigger a prior\nprison term, or he can wait out the term of probation, or he can attempt a 17(b) motion.”\nDefense counsel indicated that he was submitting on an argument that had been made in\nthe previous case before the court “in regards to the term ‘sentencing.’ ” The court stated\nthat it “decline[d] to follow that position as to what a legal definition of ‘sentencing’ is”\nand denied defendant’s petition without prejudice pursuant to section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (a). The record on appeal does not reflect the substance of the argument in\nthe unspecified previous case to which defense counsel and the court were referring. By\nwritten order filed May 27, 2015, the court denied defendant’s application.\n                                      III. DISCUSSION\n       A. Legal Background: Proposition 47\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act (the Act). (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\neff. Nov. 5, 2014.) Proposition 47 reclassified certain drug and theft related offenses as\nmisdemeanors instead of felonies or alternative felony misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (a); People v. Shabazz (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303, 308.) The statutes amended\nby Proposition 47 include Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a), the\nformer version of which provided the basis for defendant’s felony conviction. Prior to\nProposition 47, possession of a controlled substance in violation of Health and Safety\n\n                                               3\n\fCode section 11377, subdivision (a) was a wobbler. (People v. Lynall (2015) 233\nCal.App.4th 1102, 1108.) As a result of Proposition 47, Health and Safety Code\nsection 11377, subdivision (a) now provides that possession of specified controlled\nsubstances is punishable as a misdemeanor unless the defendant has certain disqualifying\nprior convictions.3\n       Proposition 47 also enacted a new statutory provision, section 1170.18, which sets\nforth two different procedures for defendants seeking to have a felony conviction\nresentenced as, or otherwise designated, a misdemeanor.\n       The first procedure under section 1170.18 applies to a defendant who is “currently\nserving a sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been guilty of a\nmisdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the offense.\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (a), italics added.) Such a defendant may petition for a recall of his or\nher sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the amended statute that\nreclassified the defendant’s offense as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) If the petitioner meets the\nrequisite statutory criteria, “the petitioner’s felony sentence shall be recalled and the\npetitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (Id., subd. (b); see id., subd. (c).) Section 1170.18 sets forth various factors that\na court may consider in exercising its discretion. (Id., subd. (b)(1)-(3).) A defendant is\nnot eligible for resentencing if he or she has suffered a specified prior conviction. (Id.,\n\n\n       3\n          Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a) provides for the following\npunishment: “imprisonment in a county jail for a period of not more than one year,\nexcept that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of\nSection 1170 of the Penal Code if that person has one or more prior convictions for an\noffense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e)\nof Section 667 of the Penal Code or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to\nsubdivision (c) of Section 290 of the Penal Code.” Section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv)\nlists a number of serious or violent felonies, which have been referred to as “super strike”\noffenses. (See People v. Rivera (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1092.)\n\n                                              4\n\fsubd. (i).) Generally, a defendant who is resentenced pursuant to section 1170.18 is\nsubject to a one-year period of parole and may not possess a firearm. (Id., subds. (d) &\n(k).)\n        The second procedure under section 1170.18 applies to a defendant who has\n“completed his or her sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been guilty\nof a misdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the offense.\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (f), italics added.) Such a person may file an application to have the\nfelony conviction designated a misdemeanor, and the trial court must make the\nmisdemeanor designation if the defendant meets the requisite criteria and has not suffered\na specified prior conviction. (Id., subds. (f), (g) & (i).) A trial court is not required to\nhold a hearing, unless requested by the applicant, before ruling on the application. (Id.,\nsubd. (h).)\n        Any petition or application must be filed within three years after the effective date\nof the Act unless good cause is shown for a later filing. (§ 1170.18, subd. (j).)\n        On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court was required to retroactively\napply the Act’s reclassification of his felony offense as a misdemeanor and automatically\ndesignate his felony conviction a misdemeanor. Defendant argues that in seeking this\nrelief in the trial court, he was not required to follow the procedure set forth in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (a) regarding a petition for a recall of sentence because, as a\nprobationer whose imposition of sentence was suspended, he is not “currently serving a\nsentence” within the meaning of subdivision (a). He argues in the alternative that, if this\ncourt determines that section 1170.18 is “the sole means of relief for those previously\nconvicted, this court must deem [him] to be ‘serving a sentence for a conviction’ so as to\npermit [him] to obtain relief through section 1170.18.”\n        The Attorney General responds that defendant was not entitled to an automatic\nreduction of his felony to a misdemeanor, and that he was required to follow the\nrecall/resentencing procedure set forth in section 1170.18. The Attorney General\n\n                                               5\n\fcontends that the matter should be remanded to the trial court to consider defendant’s\neligibility for resentencing to a misdemeanor.\n       We will first consider the issue of retroactivity before turning to the question of\nwhether defendant was required to follow the petition procedure set forth in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (a) in order to be resentenced to a misdemeanor.\n       B. Retroactivity\n                                   1. Legal background\n       Section 3 specifies that no part of the Penal Code is retroactive, “unless expressly\nso declared.” Section 3 “provides the default rule” regarding retroactivity, “codifying\n‘the time-honored principle . . . that in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a\nstatute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that\nthe Legislature [or electorate] . . . must have intended a retroactive application.’\n[Citations.]” (People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319 (Brown).)\n       A “qualification” to the prospective-only presumption regarding statutory\namendments was set forth in In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 (Estrada). (Brown,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 323.) That qualification is: “When the Legislature [or electorate]\nhas amended a statute to reduce the punishment for a particular criminal offense, we will\nassume, absent evidence to the contrary, that the Legislature [or electorate] intended the\namended statute to apply to all defendants whose judgments are not yet final on the\nstatute’s operative date. [Citation.]” (Ibid., fn. omitted.) As the Estrada court explained:\n“When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment[,] it has obviously\nexpressly determined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment\nis proper as punishment for the commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable\ninference that the Legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new\nlighter penalty now deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\nconstitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fapplied constitutionally to acts committed before its passage provided the judgment\nconvicting the defendant of the act is not final.” (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       In In re May (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 165 (May), the appellate court addressed the\napplication of Estrada and the issue of when a judgment is final for a defendant placed\non probation. In May, the “proceedings in the case were suspended and [the defendant]\nwas placed on probation” for a drug offense. (Id. at p. 167.) A statutory amendment\nsubsequently reduced the offense from a felony to a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) In the\ndefendant’s case, however, the trial court continued to treat the offense as a felony when\nthe defendant was later found in violation of probation. (Id. at pp. 167-168.) The\nappellate court determined that, “[s]ince the proceedings were suspended, no final\njudgment was entered for the purposes of this case. [Citations.] Thus, the rationale of\nEstrada applies to this case because the amendatory statute became effective after the\ncommission of the act but before the judgment of conviction was final.” (Id. at p. 169.)\nThe appellate court therefore concluded that the defendant’s offense should be designated\nand treated as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.)\n       “The rule in Estrada, of course, is not implicated where the Legislature clearly\nsignals its intent to make the amendment prospective, by the inclusion of either an\nexpress saving clause or its equivalent.” (People v. Nasalga (1996) 12 Cal.4th 784, 793,\nfn. omitted (Nasalga) (plur. opn. of Werdegar, J.); see Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 747\n[“where there is an express or implied saving clause,” the prior statute “should continue\nto operate as to past acts”].) If there is no express saving clause, one will be implied if\nthe Legislature or electorate has “demonstrate[d] its intention with sufficient clarity that a\nreviewing court can discern and effectuate it.” (In re Pedro T. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1041,\n1049 (Pedro T.).)\n       For example, the “functional equivalent of a saving clause” was included in\nProposition 36, the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform Act). (People v.\nYearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 172 (Yearwood).) The Reform Act “change[d]\n\n                                              7\n\fthe requirements for sentencing a third strike offender” by authorizing life sentences only\nin certain cases. (Yearwood, supra, at p. 167.) The Reform Act also enacted a new\nstatute, section 1170.126, which “created a postconviction release proceeding whereby\n[an eligible] prisoner . . . may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a\nsecond strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. [Citation.]” (Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.)\n       The Yearwood defendant was sentenced as a third strike offender prior to the\nReform Act. (Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 167.) Had he been sentenced after\nthe Reform Act, he would not have been sentenced to an indeterminate life term.\n(Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.) The appellate court considered whether it could issue an\norder that he be resentenced, or whether his remedy was “limited to filing a petition for a\nrecall of his sentence in compliance with section 1170.126.” (Ibid.)\n       The Yearwood defendant argued that the Reform Act should apply retroactively,\nbased on Estrada, because the Reform Act reduced the punishment for his offense. The\nYearwood court disagreed, finding that “[t]he Estrada rule does not apply to the [Reform]\nAct because section 1170.126 operates as the functional equivalent of a saving clause.”\n(Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 172.) The court examined the language of\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (b), which provides, “Any person serving an indeterminate\nterm of life imprisonment” imposed for a third strike conviction “may file a petition for a\nrecall of sentence.” The court found this phrase was “not ambiguous” and that\nsection 1170.126 “is correctly interpreted to apply to all prisoners serving an\nindeterminate life sentence imposed under the former three strikes law.” (Yearwood,\nsupra, at p. 175.)4\n\n\n       4\n         The California Supreme Court is currently considering whether the Reform Act’s\nresentencing provisions apply retroactively to a defendant who was sentenced before the\nact’s effective date, but whose judgment was not final until after that date. (See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Conley (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1482, review granted Aug. 14, 2013, S211275.)\n\n                                             8\n\f                                          2. Analysis\n       Defendant contends that, as a probationer whose imposition of sentence has been\nsuspended, he is entitled to “receiv[e] the benefit of ameliorative legislation passed after\nthe grant of probation.” Specifically, he argues that he is entitled to the benefit of\nProposition 47 and the resulting statutory amendment that changed his drug offense from\na felony to a misdemeanor, “in the same manner as those persons coming before the court\nfor the first time” after the amendment.\n       The question of whether retroactive application of Proposition 47’s reduced\npenalty provisions is required under Estrada requires a determination of the intent of the\nelectorate (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 744), which may be signaled by the inclusion\nof “either an express saving clause or its equivalent” (Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at\np. 793; see Estrada, supra, at p. 747).\n       We determine that although Proposition 47 does not have an express saving\nclause, it did create section 1170.18, which is functionally equivalent to a saving clause.\n(See Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 793; Pedro T., supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 1049; Estrada,\nsupra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 747.) In enacting Proposition 47, the electorate drew distinctions\nbetween three categories of defendants—those who had not yet been sentenced, those\nwho were “currently serving” sentences (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), and those who had\ncompleted their sentences (id., subd. (f))—and it provided procedures for those latter two\ncategories of defendants who sought to benefit from the ameliorative provisions provided\nby Proposition 47. In particular, under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a defendant who\nis “currently serving a sentence for a conviction” may petition for a recall of sentence and\nresentencing. Like the resentencing petition process created by the Reform Act, the\nresentencing petition process contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (a) expressly\napplies to defendants who are “currently serving a sentence” for a crime that would have\nbeen a misdemeanor after the passage of Proposition 47. (Cf. § 1170.126, subd. (b); see\nYearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 173.) By setting forth a specific procedure for\n\n                                              9\n\fthose defendants who were “currently serving a sentence” at the time the initiative took\neffect (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), the electorate effectively and clearly “demonstrate[d] its\nintention” that such defendants follow those procedures set forth in section 1170.18\nbefore being resentenced (Pedro T., supra, at p. 1049).\n       We therefore turn to the question of whether defendant is “currently serving a\nsentence,” such that the recall and resentencing procedure set forth in section 1170.18\napplies to him.\n       C. “Currently Serving a Sentence”\n       As we set forth above, section 1170.18 sets forth the procedure by which a\ndefendant “currently serving a sentence” (id., subd. (a)) for a felony conviction may\npetition for a recall of his or her sentence and potentially be resentenced to a\nmisdemeanor (see, e.g., id., subds. (a) - (d)). Defendant contends that, because the\nimposition of his sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation (see §§ 1203,\nsubd. (a), 1203.1, subd. (a), 1203.2, subd. (c)), he is not “currently serving a sentence”\nwithin the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a), and therefore the petition\nprocedure provided by section 1170.18 does not apply to him. Defendant argues in the\nalternative that, if this court determines that section 1170.18 is “the sole means of relief\nfor those previously convicted, this court must deem [him] to be ‘serving a sentence for a\nconviction’ so as to permit [him] to obtain relief through section 1170.18.”\n       The Attorney General contends that “a probationer whose imposition of sentence\nwas suspended, is serving a sentence within the meaning of Proposition 47,” and that\ndefendant must therefore follow the procedures for recall or resentencing that are set\nforth in section 1170.18.\n       “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, [1] “we turn first to the language of the statute,\ngiving the words their ordinary meaning.” [Citation.] [2] The statutory language must\nalso be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme\n\n                                              10\n\f[in light of the electorate’s intent]. [Citation.] [3] When the language is ambiguous,\n“we refer to other indicia of the voters’ intent, particularly the analyses and arguments\ncontained in the official ballot pamphlet.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.] [¶] In other words,\nour ‘task is simply to interpret and apply the initiative’s language so as to effectuate the\nelectorate’s intent.’ [Citation.]” (Robert L. v. Superior Court (2003) 30 Cal.4th 894,\n900-901.)\n       In People v. Garcia (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 555 (Garcia), we determined that the\nphrase “currently serving a sentence for a conviction” in section 1170.18, subdivision (a),\n“appl[ies] to all those with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who\notherwise meet the conditions specified in the statutory scheme.” (Garcia, supra, at\np. 559.) In that case, as in the instant case, the trial court suspended imposition of\nsentence and placed the defendant on probation for felony possession of a controlled\nsubstance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)). (Garcia, supra, at p. 557.)\n       We agreed with the parties in Garcia that interpreting the statutory language to\nnot include probationers would lead to absurd consequences. We observed that “there is\nnothing in either the ballot materials or the statutory language that appears to limit the\nphrase ‘currently serving a sentence for a conviction’ to those serving a term of\nimprisonment.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 558.) Moreover, “granting\nprobation is in some contexts a ‘sentencing choice’ (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 4.405(6) [‘ “Sentence choice” means the selection of any disposition of the case\nthat does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial.’]). (Cf. People v.\nHoward (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1081, 1084 [referring to court’s authority ‘at time of\nsentencing’ either to suspend imposition of sentence or impose sentence and suspend its\nexecution]; In re DeLong (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 562, 571 [‘an order granting probation\nand suspending imposition of sentence is a form of sentencing’].)” (Ibid.) Indeed, “the\nlanguage of another voter initiative, Proposition 36, the Substance Abuse and Crime\nPrevention Act of 2000, used the language ‘sentenced to probation.’ (See People v.\n\n                                              11\n\fMendoza (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1034 [quoting ballot pamphlet to distinguish\nconviction from sentence and referring to ‘sentence of probation’].)” (Ibid.)\n       We explained in Garcia that “[t]he ballot materials for Proposition 47 likewise\nindicate that the voters regarded probation as one of the options within a sentencing\nprocedure; the legislative analysis refers to offenders who are ‘sentenced’ to supervision\nby a county probation officer while indicating that both jail time for eligible offenders\nand the caseloads of probation officers would be reduced by including felony probation\nas a disposition eligible for resentencing under section 1170.18. (See People v. Shabazz\n(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303, 310 [discussing Prop. 47 mechanism for resentencing after\nbeing ‘sentenced or placed on probation’].) The Legislative Analyst discussed these\noptions under the heading of ‘Misdemeanor Sentencing’ and generally noted the fiscal\nconsequences of ‘the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies\nthat are changed to misdemeanors.’ (Italics added.) Nothing in the text of the initiative,\nthe legislative analysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to\ndistinguish between a prison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of\nprobation after suspending imposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but\nsuspending its execution. The statute itself allows the recall of a ‘felony sentence’ and\nallows the petitioner to request ‘resentencing’ in Health and Safety Code section 11377\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) . . . Proposition 47 was intended to reach those with\n‘nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,’ which would encompass many\nwho were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide, [Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014)]\ntext of Prop. 47, § 3, p. 70.) To deprive those defendants of the benefit of the reduced\npenalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either\nanticipated or approved.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559, fns. omitted.)\n       In this case, defendant argues that the California Supreme Court in People v.\nScott (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1415 (Scott), recognized a distinction between probationers\n\n                                              12\n\fwhose imposition of sentence has been suspended and probationers whose execution of\nsentence has been suspended in the context of the Criminal Justice Realignment Act of\n2011 (Stats. 2011, ch. 15, § 1; Stats. 2011, 1st Ex. Sess. 2011-2012, ch. 12, § 1)\n(Realignment Act). The Realignment Act, which changed the punishment for some\nfelony convictions from prison to county jail (Scott, supra, at p. 1418-1419), “applied\nprospectively to any person sentenced on or after October 1, 2011” (§ 1170, subd. (h)(6),\nitalics added). In Scott, the California Supreme Court concluded that a defendant placed\non probation “is ‘sentenced’ when a judgment imposing punishment is pronounced\n[although] execution of the sentence is then suspended.” (Scott, supra, at p. 1423.) The\ncourt reached this conclusion based on “the statutory provisions and case law existing at\nthe time of the Legislature’s enactment of section 1170[, subdivision] (h)(6) in 2011.”\n(Ibid.) The court explained that “[t]here is no definition of ‘sentenced’ in the\nRealignment Act itself and nothing in the legislative history of the [Realignment] Act\nindicates how the Legislature intended the [Realignment] Act to be applied in this\nsituation.” (Id. at p. 1421.)\n       In contrast, as we have explained, “[t]he ballot materials for Proposition 47 . . .\nindicate that the voters regarded probation as one of the options within a sentencing\nprocedure.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 558, fn. omitted.) Moreover, to give\ndefendants sentenced to prison but not those granted probation “the benefit of the reduced\npenalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either\nanticipated or approved.” (Id. at p. 559.)\n       Defendant argues that section 1170.18 places “limitations” on a recall petition or\non resentencing, and that these limitations only apply or only “make sense” in the context\nof a defendant who has been sentenced to prison rather than a defendant who has been\nplaced on probation. The “limitations” identified by defendant include: (1) a defendant\nwho has suffered a specified prior conviction, such as rape, murder, or child molestation\nmay not petition for a recall of sentence (§ 1170.18, subd. (i)), (2) the court must make a\n\n                                             13\n\fdetermination that resentencing the defendant will not pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety, meaning an unreasonable risk that the defendant will commit a\nnew violent felony, and this determination may include consideration of the defendant’s\ndisciplinary and rehabilitation records while incarcerated (id., subds. (b) & (c)), (3) a\ndefendant who is resentenced is subject to a one-year period of parole unless the court\norders a release from parole (id., subd. (d)), and (4) a court resentencing a defendant may\nnot impose a term longer than the original sentence. Regarding the first limitation,\ndefendant argues that it is unlikely that a probationer has suffered one of the specified\nprior convictions. Regarding the second limitation, defendant contends that it is unlikely\na defendant would have received probation if the court believed the defendant posed an\nunreasonable risk of committing a new violent felony. Regarding the third limitation,\ndefendant contends that it “makes no sense” that a person placed on probation would\n“also receive consecutive parole supervision of one year.” Regarding the fourth\nlimitation, defendant argues that a court could never impose a longer sentence on a\nperson whose imposition of sentence was suspended because such a person never had a\nsentence imposed in the first place.\n       We are not persuaded by defendant’s arguments. Some of the “limitations” may\nbe more appropriately applied to one defendant over another defendant, whether those\ntwo defendants are both in prison, both on probation, or one in prison and one on\nprobation. The existence of the “limitations,” however, are not inconsistent with an\nintent by the electorate to include probationers within the recall/resentencing procedures.\nFor example, that a court may be more likely to have public safety concerns when a recall\npetition is brought by a defendant in prison as compared to a petition brought by a\nprobationer, does not suggest that the electorate intended to allow a recall petition by a\nprisoner only and not by a probationer.\n       Defendant also briefly refers to section 1170.18, subdivision (n), which states that\n“[n]othing in this and related sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of\n\n                                             14\n\fjudgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act.” Defendant argues that\nthis subdivision “make[s] sense only in the context” of defendants sentenced to prison,\nbecause probationers whose imposition of sentence have been suspended “do not have\nfinal judgments of conviction.” We are not persuaded by defendant’s argument. For\npurposes of finality, a defendant may appeal from “a final judgment of conviction,”\nwhich includes “an order granting probation.” (§ 1237, subd. (a).) The existence of\nsubdivision (n) thus does not persuade us that section 1170.18 applies only to defendants\nin prison and not on probation.\n       D. Summary\n       Defendant, who was on probation, sought to have his felony drug conviction\nautomatically designated a misdemeanor. He filed an application under section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (f), which applies to a defendant who has “completed” his or her sentence.\n(Ibid.) The trial court determined that defendant had not yet been sentenced, and it also\napparently determined that none of the procedures provided by section 1170.18 were\navailable to defendant. As we have explained, however, defendant is “currently serving\na sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a).5 Therefore, the trial\ncourt could properly consider a petition by defendant for recall and resentencing under\nsubdivision (a).\n       Although the trial court believed that defendant could not petition for recall and\nresentencing under section 1170.18, subdivision (a) while on probation, and we have\nconcluded otherwise, we find no basis for reversing the court’s order in this case.\nDefendant in this case filed an application under subdivision (f) for automatic designation\nof his felony conviction as a misdemeanor, rather than a petition for recall and\nresentencing under subdivision (a). Because defendant was still on probation and serving\n\n       5\n         In People v. Davis (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 127, petition for review pending,\npetition filed May 6, 2016, S234324, the appellate court similarly concluded that\nprobationers fall within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n\n                                            15\n\fa sentence, he was not entitled to an automatic designation of his felony conviction as a\nmisdemeanor under subdivision (f). Accordingly, the court’s denial of defendant’s\npetition without prejudice was proper.6\n                                   IV.

INTRODUCTION\n         Defendant Hector Rodriguez Contreras pleaded no contest to felony possession of\na controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)). The trial court\nsuspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation. While defendant\nwas on probation, Penal Code section 1170.181 was enacted by the voters as part of\nProposition 47, which reclassified certain offenses as misdemeanors. Defendant filed an\napplication in the trial court under section 1170.18, subdivision (f) to have his felony\nconviction designated a misdemeanor. The court denied the petition without prejudice\npursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n\n\n\n\n         1\n             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\f       On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to automatically\ndesignate his felony conviction a misdemeanor. Defendant contends that the ameliorative\nprovisions of Proposition 47 in reclassifying certain offenses as misdemeanors applied\nretroactively to him, and that he was not required to follow the procedures for recall and\nresentencing set forth in section 1170.18 in order to have his offense designated a\nmisdemeanor.\n       For reasons that we will explain, we will affirm the order.\n                 II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In June 2013, defendant was charged by complaint with two counts pertaining to a\ncontrolled substance and paraphernalia. In July 2013, the complaint was amended to add\ncount 3, felony possession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code,\n§ 11377, subd. (a)), and defendant pleaded no contest to that count. The trial court\nsuspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on Proposition 36 probation for\n18 months (see § 1210.1). The remaining counts were dismissed.\n       In October 2013, defendant was found in violation of probation and probation was\nrevoked. Thereafter, in November 2013, the trial court terminated defendant’s\nProposition 36 probation and placed him on formal probation for three years.2\n       In April and in May 2014, defendant admitted violating probation. Probation was\nrevoked and reinstated each time.\n       In March 2015, after Proposition 47 had passed, defendant filed an application\nrequesting that his felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance be\ndesignated a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivisions (f) and (g). In the\n\n\n\n       2\n        The judgment (order of probation) was the subject of defendant’s prior appeal\n(People v. Contreras (Jun. 10, 2015, H040402) [nonpub. opn.]). This court ultimately\naffirmed the judgment. In the present appeal, defendant refers to portions of the record in\ncase No. H040402. On our own motion, we take judicial notice of the record in that case.\n(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).)\n\n                                             2\n\fapplication, which was on a preprinted form, defendant marked a box indicating that he\nhad “completed” his “sentence.” He left unmarked a box indicating that he was currently\nserving a sentence.\n       In April 2015, the prosecution filed a response, contending that defendant was\n“not eligible for the requested relief” because he “ha[d] not been sentenced.”\n       A hearing was held on the matter on May 27, 2015. The trial court indicated that\nthe “same issue” had been taken up in a “previous case” before the court. The court\nexplained that, in felony probation cases, “[t]he way we’ve been handling these in this\ndepartment is that, essentially, he can ask to be sentenced but that may trigger a prior\nprison term, or he can wait out the term of probation, or he can attempt a 17(b) motion.”\nDefense counsel indicated that he was submitting on an argument that had been made in\nthe previous case before the court “in regards to the term ‘sentencing.’ ” The court stated\nthat it “decline[d] to follow that position as to what a legal definition of ‘sentencing’ is”\nand denied defendant’s petition without prejudice pursuant to section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (a). The record on appeal does not reflect the substance of the argument in\nthe unspecified previous case to which defense counsel and the court were referring. By\nwritten order filed May 27, 2015, the court denied defendant’s application.\n                                      III. DISCUSSION\n       A. Legal Background: Proposition 47\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act (the Act). (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\neff. Nov. 5, 2014.) Proposition 47 reclassified certain drug and theft related offenses as\nmisdemeanors instead of felonies or alternative felony misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (a); People v. Shabazz (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308.) The statutes amended\nby Proposition 47 include Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a), the\nformer version of which provided the basis for defendant’s felony conviction. Prior to\nProposition 47, possession of a controlled substance in violation of Health and Safety\n\n                                               3\n\fCode section 11377, subdivision (a) was a wobbler. (People v. Lynall (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1108.) As a result of Proposition 47, Health and Safety Code\nsection 11377, subdivision (a) now provides that possession of specified controlled\nsubstances is punishable as a misdemeanor unless the defendant has certain disqualifying\nprior convictions.3\n       Proposition 47 also enacted a new statutory provision, section 1170.18, which sets\nforth two different procedures for defendants seeking to have a felony conviction\nresentenced as, or otherwise designated, a misdemeanor.\n       The first procedure under section 1170.18 applies to a defendant who is “currently\nserving a sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been guilty of a\nmisdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the offense.\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (a), italics added.) Such a defendant may petition for a recall of his or\nher sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the amended statute that\nreclassified the defendant’s offense as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) If the petitioner meets the\nrequisite statutory criteria, “the petitioner’s felony sentence shall be recalled and the\npetitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (Id., subd. (b); see id., subd. (c).) Section 1170.18 sets forth various factors that\na court may consider in exercising its discretion. (Id., subd. (b)(1)-(3).) A defendant is\nnot eligible for resentencing if he or she has suffered a specified prior conviction. (Id.,\n\n\n       3\n          Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a) provides for the following\npunishment: “imprisonment in a county jail for a period of not more than one year,\nexcept that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of\nSection 1170 of the Penal Code if that person has one or more prior convictions for an\noffense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e)\nof Section 667 of the Penal Code or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to\nsubdivision (c) of Section 290 of the Penal Code.” Section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv)\nlists a number of serious or violent felonies, which have been referred to as “super strike”\noffenses. (See People v. Rivera (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1092.)\n\n                                              4\n\fsubd. (i).) Generally, a defendant who is resentenced pursuant to section 1170.18 is\nsubject to a one-year period of parole and may not possess a firearm. (Id., subds. (d) &\n(k).)\n        The second procedure under section 1170.18 applies to a defendant who has\n“completed his or her sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been guilty\nof a misdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the offense.\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (f), italics added.) Such a person may file an application to have the\nfelony conviction designated a misdemeanor, and the trial court must make the\nmisdemeanor designation if the defendant meets the requisite criteria and has not suffered\na specified prior conviction. (Id., subds. (f), (g) & (i).) A trial court is not required to\nhold a hearing, unless requested by the applicant, before ruling on the application. (Id.,\nsubd. (h).)\n        Any petition or application must be filed within three years after the effective date\nof the Act unless good cause is shown for a later filing. (§ 1170.18, subd. (j).)\n        On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court was required to retroactively\napply the Act’s reclassification of his felony offense as a misdemeanor and automatically\ndesignate his felony conviction a misdemeanor. Defendant argues that in seeking this\nrelief in the trial court, he was not required to follow the procedure set forth in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (a) regarding a petition for a recall of sentence because, as a\nprobationer whose imposition of sentence was suspended, he is not “currently serving a\nsentence” within the meaning of subdivision (a). He argues in the alternative that, if this\ncourt determines that section 1170.18 is “the sole means of relief for those previously\nconvicted, this court must deem [him] to be ‘serving a sentence for a conviction’ so as to\npermit [him] to obtain relief through section 1170.18.”\n        The Attorney General responds that defendant was not entitled to an automatic\nreduction of his felony to a misdemeanor, and that he was required to follow the\nrecall/resentencing procedure set forth in section 1170.18. The Attorney General\n\n                                               5\n\fcontends that the matter should be remanded to the trial court to consider defendant’s\neligibility for resentencing to a misdemeanor.\n       We will first consider the issue of retroactivity before turning to the question of\nwhether defendant was required to follow the petition procedure set forth in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (a) in order to be resentenced to a misdemeanor.\n       B. Retroactivity\n                                   1. Legal background\n       Section 3 specifies that no part of the Penal Code is retroactive, “unless expressly\nso declared.” Section 3 “provides the default rule” regarding retroactivity, “codifying\n‘the time-honored principle . . . that in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a\nstatute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that\nthe Legislature [or electorate] . . . must have intended a retroactive application.’\n[Citations.]” (People v. Brown (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (Brown).)\n       A “qualification” to the prospective-only presumption regarding statutory\namendments was set forth in In re Estrada (1965) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421177/in-re-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Estrada). (Brown,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 323.) That qualification is: “When the Legislature [or electorate]\nhas amended a statute to reduce the punishment for a particular criminal offense, we will\nassume, absent evidence to the contrary, that the Legislature [or electorate] intended the\namended statute to apply to all defendants whose judgments are not yet final on the\nstatute’s operative date. [Citation.]” (Ibid., fn. omitted.) As the Estrada court explained:\n“When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment[,] it has obviously\nexpressly determined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment\nis proper as punishment for the commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable\ninference that the Legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new\nlighter penalty now deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\nconstitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fapplied constitutionally to acts committed before its passage provided the judgment\nconvicting the defendant of the act is not final.” (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       In In re May (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106564\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106564/in-re-may/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (May), the appellate court addressed the\napplication of Estrada and the issue of when a judgment is final for a defendant placed\non probation. In May, the “proceedings in the case were suspended and [the defendant]\nwas placed on probation” for a drug offense. (Id. at p. 167.) A statutory amendment\nsubsequently reduced the offense from a felony to a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) In the\ndefendant’s case, however, the trial court continued to treat the offense as a felony when\nthe defendant was later found in violation of probation. (Id. at pp. 167-168.) The\nappellate court determined that, “[s]ince the proceedings were suspended, no final\njudgment was entered for the purposes of this case. [Citations.] Thus, the rationale of\nEstrada applies to this case because the amendatory statute became effective after the\ncommission of the act but before the judgment of conviction was final.” (Id. at p. 169.)\nThe appellate court therefore concluded that the defendant’s offense should be designated\nand treated as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.)\n       “The rule in Estrada, of course, is not implicated where the Legislature clearly\nsignals its intent to make the amendment prospective, by the inclusion of either an\nexpress saving clause or its equivalent.” (People v.

The Reform Act “change[d]\n\n                                              7\n\fthe requirements for sentencing a third strike offender” by authorizing life sentences only\nin certain cases. (Yearwood, supra, at p. 167.) The Reform Act also enacted a new\nstatute, section 1170.126, which “created a postconviction release proceeding whereby\n[an eligible] prisoner . . . may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a\nsecond strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. [Citation.]” (Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.)\n       The Yearwood defendant was sentenced as a third strike offender prior to the\nReform Act. (Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 167.) Had he been sentenced after\nthe Reform Act, he would not have been sentenced to an indeterminate life term.\n(Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.) The appellate court considered whether it could issue an\norder that he be resentenced, or whether his remedy was “limited to filing a petition for a\nrecall of his sentence in compliance with section 1170.126.” (Ibid.)\n       The Yearwood defendant argued that the Reform Act should apply retroactively,\nbased on Estrada, because the Reform Act reduced the punishment for his offense. The\nYearwood court disagreed, finding that “[t]he Estrada rule does not apply to the [Reform]\nAct because section 1170.126 operates as the functional equivalent of a saving clause.”\n(Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 172.) The court examined the language of\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (b), which provides, “Any person serving an indeterminate\nterm of life imprisonment” imposed for a third strike conviction “may file a petition for a\nrecall of sentence.” The court found this phrase was “not ambiguous” and that\nsection 1170.126 “is correctly interpreted to apply to all prisoners serving an\nindeterminate life sentence imposed under the former three strikes law.” (Yearwood,\nsupra, at p. 175.)4\n\n\n       4\n         The California Supreme Court is currently considering whether the Reform Act’s\nresentencing provisions apply retroactively to a defendant who was sentenced before the\nact’s effective date, but whose judgment was not final until after that date. (See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Conley (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1482</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, review granted Aug. 14, 2013, S211275.)\n\n                                             8\n\f                                          2. Analysis\n       Defendant contends that, as a probationer whose imposition of sentence has been\nsuspended, he is entitled to “receiv[e] the benefit of ameliorative legislation passed after\nthe grant of probation.” Specifically, he argues that he is entitled to the benefit of\nProposition 47 and the resulting statutory amendment that changed his drug offense from\na felony to a misdemeanor, “in the same manner as those persons coming before the court\nfor the first time” after the amendment.\n       The question of whether retroactive application of Proposition 47’s reduced\npenalty provisions is required under Estrada requires a determination of the intent of the\nelectorate (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 744), which may be signaled by the inclusion\nof “either an express saving clause or its equivalent” (Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at\np. 793; see Estrada, supra, at p. 747).\n       We determine that although Proposition 47 does not have an express saving\nclause, it did create section 1170.18, which is functionally equivalent to a saving clause.\n(See Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 793; Pedro T., supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 1049; Estrada,\nsupra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 747.) In enacting Proposition 47, the electorate drew distinctions\nbetween three categories of defendants—those who had not yet been sentenced, those\nwho were “currently serving” sentences (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), and those who had\ncompleted their sentences (id., subd. (f))—and it provided procedures for those latter two\ncategories of defendants who sought to benefit from the ameliorative provisions provided\nby Proposition 47. In particular, under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a defendant who\nis “currently serving a sentence for a conviction” may petition for a recall of sentence and\nresentencing. Like the resentencing petition process created by the Reform Act, the\nresentencing petition process contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (a) expressly\napplies to defendants who are “currently serving a sentence” for a crime that would have\nbeen a misdemeanor after the passage of Proposition 47. (Cf. § 1170.126, subd. (b); see\nYearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 173.) By setting forth a specific procedure for\n\n                                              9\n\fthose defendants who were “currently serving a sentence” at the time the initiative took\neffect (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), the electorate effectively and clearly “demonstrate[d] its\nintention” that such defendants follow those procedures set forth in section 1170.18\nbefore being resentenced (Pedro T., supra, at p. 1049).\n       We therefore turn to the question of whether defendant is “currently serving a\nsentence,” such that the recall and resentencing procedure set forth in section 1170.18\napplies to him.\n       C. “Currently Serving a Sentence”\n       As we set forth above, section 1170.18 sets forth the procedure by which a\ndefendant “currently serving a sentence” (id., subd. (a)) for a felony conviction may\npetition for a recall of his or her sentence and potentially be resentenced to a\nmisdemeanor (see, e.g., id., subds. (a) - (d)). Defendant contends that, because the\nimposition of his sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation (see §§ 1203,\nsubd. (a), 1203.1, subd. (a), 1203.2, subd. (c)), he is not “currently serving a sentence”\nwithin the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a), and therefore the petition\nprocedure provided by section 1170.18 does not apply to him. Defendant argues in the\nalternative that, if this court determines that section 1170.18 is “the sole means of relief\nfor those previously convicted, this court must deem [him] to be ‘serving a sentence for a\nconviction’ so as to permit [him] to obtain relief through section 1170.18.”\n       The Attorney General contends that “a probationer whose imposition of sentence\nwas suspended, is serving a sentence within the meaning of Proposition 47,” and that\ndefendant must therefore follow the procedures for recall or resentencing that are set\nforth in section 1170.18.\n       “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, [1] “we turn first to the language of the statute,\ngiving the words their ordinary meaning.” [Citation.] [2] The statutory language must\nalso be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme\n\n                                              10\n\f[in light of the electorate’s intent].

In that case, as in the instant case, the trial court suspended imposition of\nsentence and placed the defendant on probation for felony possession of a controlled\nsubstance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)). (Garcia, supra, at p. 557.)\n       We agreed with the parties in Garcia that interpreting the statutory language to\nnot include probationers would lead to absurd consequences. We observed that “there is\nnothing in either the ballot materials or the statutory language that appears to limit the\nphrase ‘currently serving a sentence for a conviction’ to those serving a term of\nimprisonment.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 558.) Moreover, “granting\nprobation is in some contexts a ‘sentencing choice’ (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 4.405(6) [‘ “Sentence choice” means the selection of any disposition of the case\nthat does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial.’]). (Cf.

The Legislative Analyst discussed these\noptions under the heading of ‘Misdemeanor Sentencing’ and generally noted the fiscal\nconsequences of ‘the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies\nthat are changed to misdemeanors.’ (Italics added.) Nothing in the text of the initiative,\nthe legislative analysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to\ndistinguish between a prison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of\nprobation after suspending imposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but\nsuspending its execution. The statute itself allows the recall of a ‘felony sentence’ and\nallows the petitioner to request ‘resentencing’ in Health and Safety Code section 11377\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) . . . Proposition 47 was intended to reach those with\n‘nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,’ which would encompass many\nwho were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide, [Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014)]\ntext of Prop. 47, § 3, p. 70.) To deprive those defendants of the benefit of the reduced\npenalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either\nanticipated or approved.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559, fns. omitted.)\n       In this case, defendant argues that the California Supreme Court in People v.\nScott (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Scott), recognized a distinction between probationers\n\n                                              12\n\fwhose imposition of sentence has been suspended and probationers whose execution of\nsentence has been suspended in the context of the Criminal Justice Realignment Act of\n2011 (Stats. 2011, ch. 15, § 1; Stats. 2011, 1st Ex. Sess. 2011-2012, ch. 12, § 1)\n(Realignment Act). The Realignment Act, which changed the punishment for some\nfelony convictions from prison to county jail (Scott, supra, at p. 1418-1419), “applied\nprospectively to any person sentenced on or after October 1, 2011” (§ 1170, subd. (h)(6),\nitalics added). In Scott, the California Supreme Court concluded that a defendant placed\non probation “is ‘sentenced’ when a judgment imposing punishment is pronounced\n[although] execution of the sentence is then suspended.” (Scott, supra, at p. 1423.) The\ncourt reached this conclusion based on “the statutory provisions and case law existing at\nthe time of the Legislature’s enactment of section 1170[, subdivision] (h)(6) in 2011.”\n(Ibid.) The court explained that “[t]here is no definition of ‘sentenced’ in the\nRealignment Act itself and nothing in the legislative history of the [Realignment] Act\nindicates how the Legislature intended the [Realignment] Act to be applied in this\nsituation.” (Id. at p. 1421.)\n       In contrast, as we have explained, “[t]he ballot materials for Proposition 47 . . .\nindicate that the voters regarded probation as one of the options within a sentencing\nprocedure.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 558, fn. omitted.) Moreover, to give\ndefendants sentenced to prison but not those granted probation “the benefit of the reduced\npenalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either\nanticipated or approved.” (Id. at p. 559.)\n       Defendant argues that section 1170.18 places “limitations” on a recall petition or\non resentencing, and that these limitations only apply or only “make sense” in the context\nof a defendant who has been sentenced to prison rather than a defendant who has been\nplaced on probation. The “limitations” identified by defendant include: (1) a defendant\nwho has suffered a specified prior conviction, such as rape, murder, or child molestation\nmay not petition for a recall of sentence (§ 1170.18, subd. (i)), (2) the court must make a\n\n                                             13\n\fdetermination that resentencing the defendant will not pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety, meaning an unreasonable risk that the defendant will commit a\nnew violent felony, and this determination may include consideration of the defendant’s\ndisciplinary and rehabilitation records while incarcerated (id., subds. (b) & (c)), (3) a\ndefendant who is resentenced is subject to a one-year period of parole unless the court\norders a release from parole (id., subd. (d)), and (4) a court resentencing a defendant may\nnot impose a term longer than the original sentence. Regarding the first limitation,\ndefendant argues that it is unlikely that a probationer has suffered one of the specified\nprior convictions. Regarding the second limitation, defendant contends that it is unlikely\na defendant would have received probation if the court believed the defendant posed an\nunreasonable risk of committing a new violent felony. Regarding the third limitation,\ndefendant contends that it “makes no sense” that a person placed on probation would\n“also receive consecutive parole supervision of one year.” Regarding the fourth\nlimitation, defendant argues that a court could never impose a longer sentence on a\nperson whose imposition of sentence was suspended because such a person never had a\nsentence imposed in the first place.\n       We are not persuaded by defendant’s arguments. Some of the “limitations” may\nbe more appropriately applied to one defendant over another defendant, whether those\ntwo defendants are both in prison, both on probation, or one in prison and one on\nprobation. The existence of the “limitations,” however, are not inconsistent with an\nintent by the electorate to include probationers within the recall/resentencing procedures.\nFor example, that a court may be more likely to have public safety concerns when a recall\npetition is brought by a defendant in prison as compared to a petition brought by a\nprobationer, does not suggest that the electorate intended to allow a recall petition by a\nprisoner only and not by a probationer.\n       Defendant also briefly refers to section 1170.18, subdivision (n), which states that\n“[n]othing in this and related sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of\n\n                                             14\n\fjudgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act.” Defendant argues that\nthis subdivision “make[s] sense only in the context” of defendants sentenced to prison,\nbecause probationers whose imposition of sentence have been suspended “do not have\nfinal judgments of conviction.” We are not persuaded by defendant’s argument. For\npurposes of finality, a defendant may appeal from “a final judgment of conviction,”\nwhich includes “an order granting probation.” (§ 1237, subd. (a).) The existence of\nsubdivision (n) thus does not persuade us that section 1170.18 applies only to defendants\nin prison and not on probation.\n       D. Summary\n       Defendant, who was on probation, sought to have his felony drug conviction\nautomatically designated a misdemeanor. He filed an application under section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (f), which applies to a defendant who has “completed” his or her sentence.\n(Ibid.) The trial court determined that defendant had not yet been sentenced, and it also\napparently determined that none of the procedures provided by section 1170.18 were\navailable to defendant. As we have explained, however, defendant is “currently serving\na sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a).5 Therefore, the trial\ncourt could properly consider a petition by defendant for recall and resentencing under\nsubdivision (a).\n       Although the trial court believed that defendant could not petition for recall and\nresentencing under section 1170.18, subdivision (a) while on probation, and we have\nconcluded otherwise, we find no basis for reversing the court’s order in this case.\nDefendant in this case filed an application under subdivision (f) for automatic designation\nof his felony conviction as a misdemeanor, rather than a petition for recall and\nresentencing under subdivision (a).
