Brown alleges that prison officials violated his\ndue process rights by housing him in the Intensive\nManagement Unit (“IMU”) without periodic, meaningful\nreview of his status.\n\n    We hold that, under any plausible baseline, Brown’s\nconditions of confinement implicate a protected liberty\ninterest giving rise to the procedural protections of the Due\nProcess Clause. We also hold, however, that defendants are\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment and qualified immunity. We\ntherefore affirm.\n\f4           BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n    Brown was assigned a Level 5 custody classification and\nplaced in the IMU at SRCI on June 18, 2008, after being\nfound in possession of a weapon. He remained confined in\nthe IMU at either SRCI or the Oregon State Penitentiary\n(“OSP”) for twenty-seven consecutive months, until his\nrelease to the OSP general population on September 22, 2010.\n\n    Pursuant to the Oregon Administrative Rules, a Level 5\ncustody classification is the highest level of supervision and\nis assigned to inmates demonstrating “behaviors that in the\njudgment of the department present a threat sufficient to\nrequire special security housing on intensive management\nstatus.” Oregon Administrative Rule (“OAR”) 291-104-\n0111(9)(a)(A). Level 5 classifications are assigned by the\nSpecial Population Management Committee. OAR 291-104-\n0125(3)(a). Once an inmate is assigned to Level 5, he is\nplaced in the IMU or an IMU-status cell, and that status\nremains until the inmate “is manually scored to a lower\ncustody classification level by the assigned institutional\ncounselor.” OAR 291-104-0125(3)(b); see also OAR 291-\n055-0005(3)(b), 0031.\n\n    IMU inmates are held in solitary confinement for more\nthan twenty-three hours per day. They are permitted outside\nof their cells for a total of only forty minutes per day and may\nspend thirty of those minutes engaged in recreation. Half of\nthat time–fifteen minutes–may be spent in an “outside”\nfacility reserved for IMU use, within a fifteen by forty-foot\nroom with high, concrete walls covered by a metal grate.\nInmates in the general population, in contrast, receive twenty-\nfive to thirty hours per week for recreation and social\ninteraction, including two to five hours of outside recreation\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                  5\n\nevery day. IMU inmates are permitted two non-contact visits\nper month and a maximum of two visitors in a six-month\nperiod, while general-population inmates are permitted\nbetween eleven and twenty-two contact visits per month and\nan unlimited number of approved visitors. IMU inmates are\ndenied access to many other privileges afforded inmates in\nthe general population, including access to the prison and law\nlibraries, group religious worship, educational and vocational\nopportunities, telephone use except in emergencies, access to\ntelevisions, and access to personal property.\n\n    IMU inmates are assigned a numerical “Programming\nLevel” between 1 and 4. OAR 291-055-0020. Upon their\nplacement in the IMU, inmates are assigned to Programming\nLevel 2 and are given mandatory behavior-modification\nprograms comprising individual program “packets.” OAR\n291-055-0020(2)(b), (d). Inmates are not eligible for release\nfrom the IMU until they have attained Programming Level 4\nstatus, which requires “successful completion” of the\nassigned packets. OAR 291-055-0020(2)(d)(C). Because\nonly one program packet may be completed in any two-week\nperiod, the duration of an inmate’s confinement is dependent\non the number of packets that he is assigned.\n\n    Although prior Oregon Department of Corrections\n(“ODOC”) regulations required reviews of inmates’ custody\nclassifications every six months, see OAR 291-104-0125\n(abrogated), ODOC discontinued this practice following\namendments to the administrative rules in May 2008. Current\nreview procedures consist only of “programming” reviews,\nthirty-day reviews of each IMU inmate’s programming status.\nOAR 291-055-0020(2), 0025(2). As part of this review\nprocedure, within thirty days of an inmate reaching\nProgramming Level 4, the Inmate Program Committee is\n\f6           BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nrequired to provide a written recommendation for or against\nrelease from the IMU to the Classification Transfer Unit,\nwhich is charged with making the final determination\nregarding the inmate’s classification status. OAR 291-055-\n0031(2)–(3).\n\n    The Administrative Segregation Unit (“ASU”) and\nDisciplinary Segregation Unit (“DSU”) constitute other forms\nof segregated housing in the ODOC prison system. ASU is\n“[a]dministrative housing for those inmates whose notoriety,\nactions, or threats jeopardize the safety, security, and orderly\noperation of the facility.” OAR 291-046-0010(3). DSU is\npunitive housing reserved for inmates “in violation of rules of\nprohibited conduct.” OAR 291-011-0005(2).\n\n    Unlike the IMU, inmates may not be housed in the DSU\nfor longer than 180 days, and are entitled to thirty-day\n“assessment” reviews evaluating whether to recommend their\nearly release from segregation. OAR 291-105-0066(10), 291-\n011-0030(3). Other conditions of confinement in the DSU\ngenerally are similar to conditions in the IMU, although DSU\ninmates are not required to participate in behavior-\nmodification programs.\n\n    Retention in the ASU is limited to no more than thirty\ndays without a hearing and status review and no more than\n180 days without “due process.” OAR 291-046-0025(4),\n0085(2), 0090(1). Conditions in the ASU are less restrictive\nthan in the IMU, with ASU inmates afforded access to\ntelephones, televisions, computers, and personal shoes and\nother property. Inmates in the ASU are permitted seven\nhours of recreation per week and are not required to\nparticipate in behavior-modification programs.\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                    7\n\n    Brown was assigned to the IMU at SRCI on June 18,\n2009 and given fifty-three behavior-modification packets.\nThe subject matter of at least thirty of Brown’s assigned\npackets had no relationship to his underlying crime, the basis\nfor his confinement in the IMU, or the IMU’s stated security\nobjectives.\n\n    The Inmate Program Committee conducted four\nprogramming reviews of Brown’s status between July and\nSeptember 2008, advancing him from Programming Level 2\nto 3 on October 21, 2008. The record does not include\nevidence of any additional programming reviews until June\n2009. Thereafter, the Inmate Program Committee reviewed\nBrown’s programming status every month, keeping him at\nProgramming Level 3 pending the “successful completion”\nof his assigned mandatory programming packets. The Inmate\nProgram Committee’s meeting minutes state only that Brown\n“is programming–no change.” Brown completed his\nbehavior-modification programming and was promoted to\nProgramming Level 4 on August 24, 2010. He was released\nfrom the IMU on September 22, 2010.\n\n    While housed in the IMU, Brown submitted eight\npetitions to prison officials requesting review of his\nclassification status. Those requests were denied, and Brown\nwas not afforded a review of his classification status until the\neve of his eventual release from the IMU.\n\n    Brown filed a pro se 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action alleging,\namong other things, that defendants had violated his due\nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to\nprovide periodic, meaningful reviews of his confinement.\nDefendants moved for summary judgment; Brown did not\ncross-move. The district court granted summary judgment on\n\f8           BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nBrown’s due process claim because it concluded that ODOC\nofficials had conducted programming reviews of Brown’s\nclassification once per month in accordance with policy, and\nBrown had no liberty interest in freedom from segregation in\nthe IMU.\n\n    Now represented by pro bono counsel, Brown assigns\nerror only to the summary judgment on his due process claim.\n\n                       DISCUSSION\n\n    On de novo review, Morrison v. Hall, 261 F.3d 896, 900\n(9th Cir. 2001), we hold that, under any plausible baseline,\nBrown’s conditions of confinement implicate a protected\nliberty interest giving rise to procedural due process\nprotections. We also hold, however, that defendants are\nentitled to immunity.\n\n    A. Due Process\n\n    Prisoners are entitled to certain due process protections\nwhen subject to disciplinary sanctions. See Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 564–71 (1974). In Sandin v.\nConner, however, the Supreme Court held that these\nprocedural protections adhere only where the deprivation\nimplicates a protected liberty interest–that is, where the\nconditions of confinement impose an “atypical and significant\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life.” 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995). We may consider\n“1) whether the challenged condition ‘mirrored those\nconditions imposed upon inmates in administrative\nsegregation and protective custody,’ and thus comported with\nthe prison’s discretionary authority; 2) the duration of the\ncondition, and the degree of restraint imposed; and 3) whether\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                   9\n\nthe state’s action will invariably affect the duration of the\nprisoner’s sentence.” Ramirez v. Galaza, 334 F.3d 850, 861\n(9th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). If a protected liberty\ninterest is at stake, then the court must determine whether the\nprocedures used to deprive the prisoner of that liberty violate\ndue process. See id. at 860.\n\n    The district court granted summary judgment on Brown’s\ndue process claim because it concluded, first, that defendants\nhad conducted periodic reviews of the classification status\nthat kept Brown confined in the IMU, and second, that the\nchallenged conditions in the IMU were not atypical in\ncomparison to conditions in the ASU and DSU. We hold that\ndefendants are not entitled to summary judgment on either\nground.\n\n    First, the record shows–and defendants’ counsel conceded\nat oral argument–that Brown received no meaningful review\nof his IMU confinement for twenty-seven months. Brown’s\nterm of confinement in the IMU was dependent on his\ncompletion of fifty-three assigned packets. Because an\ninmate may complete only one program packet in any two-\nweek period, Brown’s confinement in the IMU could not\npossibly have lasted less than 106 weeks, regardless of the\nappropriateness of his continued segregation. Given that\nprison officials lack discretion to promote an inmate from one\nprogramming level to another or to release an inmate from\nthe IMU before he completes the assigned packets, Brown’s\nprogramming reviews were essentially meaningless.\n\n    Second, under any plausible baseline, Brown’s twenty-\nseven month confinement in the IMU without meaningful\nreview “impose[d] atypical and significant hardship on [him]\nin relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin,\n\f10          BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n515 U.S. at 484. As an initial matter, we recognize that the\nbaseline for determining “atypical and significant hardship”\nis not entirely clear. We have noted that “[t]he Sandin Court\nseems to suggest that a major difference between the\nconditions for the general prison population and the\nsegregated population triggers a right to a hearing,” Keenan\nv. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1089 (9th Cir. 1996), but have not\nclearly held that conditions in the general population, as\nopposed to those in other forms of administrative segregation\nor protective custody, form the appropriate baseline\ncomparator. Cf. Ramirez, 334 F.3d at 861 (identifying as a\nguidepost for evaluating atypical and significant hardship\n“whether the challenged condition ‘mirrored those conditions\nimposed upon inmates in administrative segregation and\nprotective custody,’ and thus comported with the prison’s\ndiscretionary authority” (quoting Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486)).\nThe Supreme Court acknowledged this uncertainty in\nWilkinson v. Austin, noting that “[i]n Sandin’s wake the\nCourts of Appeals have not reached consistent conclusions\nfor identifying the baseline from which to measure what is\natypical and significant in any particular prison system.”\n545 U.S. 209, 223 (2005). It chose not to resolve the issue,\nhowever, concluding, “[W]e are satisfied that [the challenged\nconditions] impose[] an atypical and significant hardship\nunder any plausible baseline.” Id.\n\n    Similarly, we need not locate the appropriate baseline\nhere because Brown’s twenty-seven month confinement in\nthe IMU imposed an atypical and significant hardship under\nany plausible baseline. Confinement in the IMU subjected\nBrown to solitary confinement for over twenty-three hours\neach day with almost no interpersonal contact, and denied\nhim most privileges afforded inmates in the general\npopulation. While these conditions alone might apply to most\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                  11\n\nsolitary-confinement facilities, here there is a crucial factor\ndistinguishing confinement in the IMU: the duration of\nBrown’s confinement. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678,\n686 (1978) (“[T]he length of confinement cannot be ignored\nin deciding whether the confinement meets constitutional\nstandards.”). Brown was given a fixed and irreducible period\nof confinement in the IMU for twenty-seven months, in\ncontrast to the limited period of confinement with periodic\nreview afforded inmates in ODOC’s other segregated-housing\nunits. Retention in the ASU is limited to no more than thirty\ndays without a hearing or status review. Retention in the\nDSU–where conditions of confinement generally are similar\nto conditions in the IMU–is limited by thirty-day assessment\nreviews, with the maximum period of confinement limited to\nsix months. Brown’s conditions of confinement in the IMU\nthus implicate a protected liberty interest under any plausible\nbaseline.\n\n   B. Immunity\n\n    We nonetheless affirm the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment because defendants are entitled to\nEleventh Amendment and qualified immunity. See Johnson\nv. Riverside Healthcare Sys., LP, 534 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th\nCir. 2008) (explaining that we may affirm on any ground\nsupported by the record). First, Brown’s claims against the\nOregon Department of Corrections and his damages claims\nagainst the individual defendants in their official capacities\nare barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See Pennhurst State\nSch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984) (“It is\nclear . . . that in the absence of consent a suit in which the\nState or one of its agencies or departments is named as the\ndefendant is proscribed by the Eleventh Amendment.”);\nJackson v. Hayakawa, 682 F.2d 1344, 1350 (9th Cir. 1982)\n\f12           BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n(explaining that “Eleventh Amendment immunity extends to\nactions against state officers sued in their official capacities\nbecause such actions are, in essence, actions against the\ngovernmental entity,” but “does not bar actions against state\nofficers in their official capacities if the plaintiffs seek only\na declaratory judgment or injunctive relief”).\n\n    Second, Brown’s remaining damages claims are barred by\nqualified immunity. Government officials who perform\ndiscretionary functions generally are entitled to qualified\nimmunity from liability for civil damages “insofar as their\nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).\nThe Supreme Court has set forth a two-part analysis for\nresolving qualified immunity claims, which we may address\nin any order. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236\n(2009). First, we must consider whether the facts “[t]aken in\nthe light most favorable to the party asserting the injury . . .\nshow [that] the [defendant’s] conduct violated a constitutional\nright[.]” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001),\noverruled in part on other grounds by Pearson, 555 U.S. at\n236. Second, we must determine whether the right was\nclearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\nSaucier, 522 U.S. at 201. Even if the right was clearly\nestablished at the time of the violation, it may be “difficult for\n[the defendant] to determine how the relevant legal doctrine\n. . . will apply to the factual situation the [defendant]\nconfronts.” Id. at 205. Therefore, “[i]f the . . . mistake as to\nwhat the law requires is reasonable . . . the [defendant] is\nentitled to the immunity defense.” Id.\n\n   We begin with the second prong of the qualified-\nimmunity analysis: whether the right was clearly established\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                   13\n\nat the time of the alleged violation. Until now, this court has\nnot addressed whether the absence of post-placement\nperiodic, meaningful review of confinement in a disciplinary-\nsegregation unit may give rise to a protected liberty interest.\nWe previously have found a state-created liberty interest in\nreview of prisoners’ confinement arising from language of\nstate prison regulations. See Toussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d\n1080, 1097–98 (9th Cir. 1986), abrogated in part on other\ngrounds by Sandin, 515 U.S. 472. However, the Supreme\nCourt has since “refocused the test for determining the\nexistence of a liberty interest away from the wording of\nprison regulations and toward an examination of the hardship\ncaused by the prison’s challenged action relative to ‘the basic\nconditions’ of life as a prisoner.” Mitchell v. Dupnik, 75 F.3d\n517, 522 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Sandin, 515 U.S. at 485).\nThus, we must now evaluate whether the deprivation in\nquestion “imposes atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Although we conclude that a\nlengthy confinement without meaningful review may\nconstitute atypical and significant hardship, our case law has\nnot previously so held, and we cannot hold defendants liable\nfor the violation of a right that was not clearly established at\nthe time the violation occurred.\n\n     Qualified immunity “is only an immunity from a suit for\nmoney damages, and does not provide immunity from a suit\nseeking declaratory or injunctive relief.” Hydrick v. Hunter,\n669 F.3d 937, 939–40 (9th Cir. 2012). We affirm the district\ncourt’s summary judgment on Brown’s claim for declaratory\nrelief, however, because the record shows that Brown has\nbeen released from the IMU and there is no evidence that he\nis likely to again be subject to the challenged conditions. See\nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983)\n\f14          BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n(holding that past exposure to harm does not confer standing\nto obtain equitable relief “[a]bsent a sufficient likelihood that\n[the plaintiff] will again be wronged in a similar way”).\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s summary\njudgment.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\f",

Brown alleges that prison officials violated his\ndue process rights by housing him in the Intensive\nManagement Unit (“IMU”) without periodic, meaningful\nreview of his status.\n\n    We hold that, under any plausible baseline, Brown’s\nconditions of confinement implicate a protected liberty\ninterest giving rise to the procedural protections of the Due\nProcess Clause. We also hold, however, that defendants are\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment and qualified immunity. We\ntherefore affirm.\n\f4           BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n    Brown was assigned a Level 5 custody classification and\nplaced in the IMU at SRCI on June 18, 2008, after being\nfound in possession of a weapon. He remained confined in\nthe IMU at either SRCI or the Oregon State Penitentiary\n(“OSP”) for twenty-seven consecutive months, until his\nrelease to the OSP general population on September 22, 2010.\n\n    Pursuant to the Oregon Administrative Rules, a Level 5\ncustody classification is the highest level of supervision and\nis assigned to inmates demonstrating “behaviors that in the\njudgment of the department present a threat sufficient to\nrequire special security housing on intensive management\nstatus.” Oregon Administrative Rule (“OAR”) 291-104-\n0111(9)(a)(A). Level 5 classifications are assigned by the\nSpecial Population Management Committee. OAR 291-104-\n0125(3)(a). Once an inmate is assigned to Level 5, he is\nplaced in the IMU or an IMU-status cell, and that status\nremains until the inmate “is manually scored to a lower\ncustody classification level by the assigned institutional\ncounselor.” OAR 291-104-0125(3)(b); see also OAR 291-\n055-0005(3)(b), 0031.\n\n    IMU inmates are held in solitary confinement for more\nthan twenty-three hours per day. They are permitted outside\nof their cells for a total of only forty minutes per day and may\nspend thirty of those minutes engaged in recreation. Half of\nthat time–fifteen minutes–may be spent in an “outside”\nfacility reserved for IMU use, within a fifteen by forty-foot\nroom with high, concrete walls covered by a metal grate.\nInmates in the general population, in contrast, receive twenty-\nfive to thirty hours per week for recreation and social\ninteraction, including two to five hours of outside recreation\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                  5\n\nevery day. IMU inmates are permitted two non-contact visits\nper month and a maximum of two visitors in a six-month\nperiod, while general-population inmates are permitted\nbetween eleven and twenty-two contact visits per month and\nan unlimited number of approved visitors. IMU inmates are\ndenied access to many other privileges afforded inmates in\nthe general population, including access to the prison and law\nlibraries, group religious worship, educational and vocational\nopportunities, telephone use except in emergencies, access to\ntelevisions, and access to personal property.\n\n    IMU inmates are assigned a numerical “Programming\nLevel” between 1 and 4. OAR 291-055-0020. Upon their\nplacement in the IMU, inmates are assigned to Programming\nLevel 2 and are given mandatory behavior-modification\nprograms comprising individual program “packets.” OAR\n291-055-0020(2)(b), (d). Inmates are not eligible for release\nfrom the IMU until they have attained Programming Level 4\nstatus, which requires “successful completion” of the\nassigned packets. OAR 291-055-0020(2)(d)(C). Because\nonly one program packet may be completed in any two-week\nperiod, the duration of an inmate’s confinement is dependent\non the number of packets that he is assigned.\n\n    Although prior Oregon Department of Corrections\n(“ODOC”) regulations required reviews of inmates’ custody\nclassifications every six months, see OAR 291-104-0125\n(abrogated), ODOC discontinued this practice following\namendments to the administrative rules in May 2008. Current\nreview procedures consist only of “programming” reviews,\nthirty-day reviews of each IMU inmate’s programming status.\nOAR 291-055-0020(2), 0025(2). As part of this review\nprocedure, within thirty days of an inmate reaching\nProgramming Level 4, the Inmate Program Committee is\n\f6           BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nrequired to provide a written recommendation for or against\nrelease from the IMU to the Classification Transfer Unit,\nwhich is charged with making the final determination\nregarding the inmate’s classification status. OAR 291-055-\n0031(2)–(3).\n\n    The Administrative Segregation Unit (“ASU”) and\nDisciplinary Segregation Unit (“DSU”) constitute other forms\nof segregated housing in the ODOC prison system. ASU is\n“[a]dministrative housing for those inmates whose notoriety,\nactions, or threats jeopardize the safety, security, and orderly\noperation of the facility.” OAR 291-046-0010(3). DSU is\npunitive housing reserved for inmates “in violation of rules of\nprohibited conduct.” OAR 291-011-0005(2).\n\n    Unlike the IMU, inmates may not be housed in the DSU\nfor longer than 180 days, and are entitled to thirty-day\n“assessment” reviews evaluating whether to recommend their\nearly release from segregation. OAR 291-105-0066(10), 291-\n011-0030(3). Other conditions of confinement in the DSU\ngenerally are similar to conditions in the IMU, although DSU\ninmates are not required to participate in behavior-\nmodification programs.\n\n    Retention in the ASU is limited to no more than thirty\ndays without a hearing and status review and no more than\n180 days without “due process.” OAR 291-046-0025(4),\n0085(2), 0090(1). Conditions in the ASU are less restrictive\nthan in the IMU, with ASU inmates afforded access to\ntelephones, televisions, computers, and personal shoes and\nother property. Inmates in the ASU are permitted seven\nhours of recreation per week and are not required to\nparticipate in behavior-modification programs.\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                    7\n\n    Brown was assigned to the IMU at SRCI on June 18,\n2009 and given fifty-three behavior-modification packets.\nThe subject matter of at least thirty of Brown’s assigned\npackets had no relationship to his underlying crime, the basis\nfor his confinement in the IMU, or the IMU’s stated security\nobjectives.\n\n    The Inmate Program Committee conducted four\nprogramming reviews of Brown’s status between July and\nSeptember 2008, advancing him from Programming Level 2\nto 3 on October 21, 2008. The record does not include\nevidence of any additional programming reviews until June\n2009. Thereafter, the Inmate Program Committee reviewed\nBrown’s programming status every month, keeping him at\nProgramming Level 3 pending the “successful completion”\nof his assigned mandatory programming packets. The Inmate\nProgram Committee’s meeting minutes state only that Brown\n“is programming–no change.” Brown completed his\nbehavior-modification programming and was promoted to\nProgramming Level 4 on August 24, 2010. He was released\nfrom the IMU on September 22, 2010.\n\n    While housed in the IMU, Brown submitted eight\npetitions to prison officials requesting review of his\nclassification status. Those requests were denied, and Brown\nwas not afforded a review of his classification status until the\neve of his eventual release from the IMU.\n\n    Brown filed a pro se 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action alleging,\namong other things, that defendants had violated his due\nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to\nprovide periodic, meaningful reviews of his confinement.\nDefendants moved for summary judgment; Brown did not\ncross-move. The district court granted summary judgment on\n\f8           BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\nBrown’s due process claim because it concluded that ODOC\nofficials had conducted programming reviews of Brown’s\nclassification once per month in accordance with policy, and\nBrown had no liberty interest in freedom from segregation in\nthe IMU.\n\n    Now represented by pro bono counsel, Brown assigns\nerror only to the summary judgment on his due process claim.\n\n                       DISCUSSION\n\n    On de novo review, Morrison v.

We also hold, however, that defendants are\nentitled to immunity.\n\n    A. Due Process\n\n    Prisoners are entitled to certain due process protections\nwhen subject to disciplinary sanctions. See Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564–71 (1974). In Sandin v.\nConner, however, the Supreme Court held that these\nprocedural protections adhere only where the deprivation\nimplicates a protected liberty interest–that is, where the\nconditions of confinement impose an “atypical and significant\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1995). We may consider\n“1) whether the challenged condition ‘mirrored those\nconditions imposed upon inmates in administrative\nsegregation and protective custody,’ and thus comported with\nthe prison’s discretionary authority; 2) the duration of the\ncondition, and the degree of restraint imposed; and 3) whether\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                   9\n\nthe state’s action will invariably affect the duration of the\nprisoner’s sentence.” Ramirez v. Galaza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782566\"><a href=\"/opinion/782566/luis-ramirez-v-george-m-galaza-warden-james-gomez-director-of-cdc-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 861\n(9th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). If a protected liberty\ninterest is at stake, then the court must determine whether the\nprocedures used to deprive the prisoner of that liberty violate\ndue process. See id. at 860.\n\n    The district court granted summary judgment on Brown’s\ndue process claim because it concluded, first, that defendants\nhad conducted periodic reviews of the classification status\nthat kept Brown confined in the IMU, and second, that the\nchallenged conditions in the IMU were not atypical in\ncomparison to conditions in the ASU and DSU. We hold that\ndefendants are not entitled to summary judgment on either\nground.\n\n    First, the record shows–and defendants’ counsel conceded\nat oral argument–that Brown received no meaningful review\nof his IMU confinement for twenty-seven months. Brown’s\nterm of confinement in the IMU was dependent on his\ncompletion of fifty-three assigned packets. Because an\ninmate may complete only one program packet in any two-\nweek period, Brown’s confinement in the IMU could not\npossibly have lasted less than 106 weeks, regardless of the\nappropriateness of his continued segregation. Given that\nprison officials lack discretion to promote an inmate from one\nprogramming level to another or to release an inmate from\nthe IMU before he completes the assigned packets, Brown’s\nprogramming reviews were essentially meaningless.\n\n    Second, under any plausible baseline, Brown’s twenty-\nseven month confinement in the IMU without meaningful\nreview “impose[d] atypical and significant hardship on [him]\nin relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin,\n\f10          BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.\n\n515 U.S. at 484. As an initial matter, we recognize that the\nbaseline for determining “atypical and significant hardship”\nis not entirely clear. We have noted that “[t]he Sandin Court\nseems to suggest that a major difference between the\nconditions for the general prison population and the\nsegregated population triggers a right to a hearing,” Keenan\nv. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718273\"><a href=\"/opinion/718273/96-cal-daily-op-serv-3261-96-daily-journal-dar-5331-charles-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1089 (9th Cir. 1996), but have not\nclearly held that conditions in the general population, as\nopposed to those in other forms of administrative segregation\nor protective custody, form the appropriate baseline\ncomparator. Cf. Ramirez, 334 F.3d at 861 (identifying as a\nguidepost for evaluating atypical and significant hardship\n“whether the challenged condition ‘mirrored those conditions\nimposed upon inmates in administrative segregation and\nprotective custody,’ and thus comported with the prison’s\ndiscretionary authority” (quoting Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486)).\nThe Supreme Court acknowledged this uncertainty in\nWilkinson v. Austin, noting that “[i]n Sandin’s wake the\nCourts of Appeals have not reached consistent conclusions\nfor identifying the baseline from which to measure what is\natypical and significant in any particular prison system.”\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799975\"><a href=\"/opinion/799975/wilkinson-v-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (2005). It chose not to resolve the issue,\nhowever, concluding, “[W]e are satisfied that [the challenged\nconditions] impose[] an atypical and significant hardship\nunder any plausible baseline.” Id.\n\n    Similarly, we need not locate the appropriate baseline\nhere because Brown’s twenty-seven month confinement in\nthe IMU imposed an atypical and significant hardship under\nany plausible baseline. Confinement in the IMU subjected\nBrown to solitary confinement for over twenty-three hours\neach day with almost no interpersonal contact, and denied\nhim most privileges afforded inmates in the general\npopulation. While these conditions alone might apply to most\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                  11\n\nsolitary-confinement facilities, here there is a crucial factor\ndistinguishing confinement in the IMU: the duration of\nBrown’s confinement. See Hutto v. Finney, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n686 (1978) (“[T]he length of confinement cannot be ignored\nin deciding whether the confinement meets constitutional\nstandards.”). Brown was given a fixed and irreducible period\nof confinement in the IMU for twenty-seven months, in\ncontrast to the limited period of confinement with periodic\nreview afforded inmates in ODOC’s other segregated-housing\nunits. Retention in the ASU is limited to no more than thirty\ndays without a hearing or status review. Retention in the\nDSU–where conditions of confinement generally are similar\nto conditions in the IMU–is limited by thirty-day assessment\nreviews, with the maximum period of confinement limited to\nsix months. Brown’s conditions of confinement in the IMU\nthus implicate a protected liberty interest under any plausible\nbaseline.\n\n   B. Immunity\n\n    We nonetheless affirm the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment because defendants are entitled to\nEleventh Amendment and qualified immunity. See Johnson\nv. Riverside Healthcare Sys., LP, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1200144\"><a href=\"/opinion/1200144/johnson-v-riverside-healthcare-system-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1121 (9th\nCir. 2008) (explaining that we may affirm on any ground\nsupported by the record). First, Brown’s claims against the\nOregon Department of Corrections and his damages claims\nagainst the individual defendants in their official capacities\nare barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See Pennhurst State\nSch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (1984) (“It is\nclear . . . that in the absence of consent a suit in which the\nState or one of its agencies or departments is named as the\ndefendant is proscribed by the Eleventh Amendment.”);\nJackson v. Hayakawa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406198\"><a href=\"/opinion/406198/charles-jackson-and-lonnie-daniels-anthony-greene-and-jean-simmons-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1350 (9th Cir. 1982)\n\f12           BROWN V.

Government officials who perform\ndiscretionary functions generally are entitled to qualified\nimmunity from liability for civil damages “insofar as their\nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 (1982).\nThe Supreme Court has set forth a two-part analysis for\nresolving qualified immunity claims, which we may address\nin any order. See Pearson v. Callahan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236\n(2009). First, we must consider whether the facts “[t]aken in\nthe light most favorable to the party asserting the injury . . .\nshow [that] the [defendant’s] conduct violated a constitutional\nright[.]” Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (2001),\noverruled in part on other grounds by Pearson, 555 U.S. at\n236. Second, we must determine whether the right was\nclearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\nSaucier, 522 U.S. at 201. Even if the right was clearly\nestablished at the time of the violation, it may be “difficult for\n[the defendant] to determine how the relevant legal doctrine\n. . . will apply to the factual situation the [defendant]\nconfronts.” Id. at 205. Therefore, “[i]f the . . . mistake as to\nwhat the law requires is reasonable . . . the [defendant] is\nentitled to the immunity defense.” Id.\n\n   We begin with the second prong of the qualified-\nimmunity analysis: whether the right was clearly established\n\f            BROWN V. OREGON DEP’T OF CORR.                   13\n\nat the time of the alleged violation. Until now, this court has\nnot addressed whether the absence of post-placement\nperiodic, meaningful review of confinement in a disciplinary-\nsegregation unit may give rise to a protected liberty interest.\nWe previously have found a state-created liberty interest in\nreview of prisoners’ confinement arising from language of\nstate prison regulations. See Toussaint v. McCarthy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476738\"><a href=\"/opinion/476738/joseph-toussaint-plaintiffsappelleescross-appellants-v-daniel-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1080</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1097–98 (9th Cir. 1986), abrogated in part on other\ngrounds by Sandin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. However, the Supreme\nCourt has since “refocused the test for determining the\nexistence of a liberty interest away from the wording of\nprison regulations and toward an examination of the hardship\ncaused by the prison’s challenged action relative to ‘the basic\nconditions’ of life as a prisoner.” Mitchell v. Dupnik, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712148\"><a href=\"/opinion/712148/96-cal-daily-op-serv-545-96-daily-journal-dar-883-anthony-dewayne/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Sandin, 515 U.S. at 485).\nThus, we must now evaluate whether the deprivation in\nquestion “imposes atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Although we conclude that a\nlengthy confinement without meaningful review may\nconstitute atypical and significant hardship, our case law has\nnot previously so held, and we cannot hold defendants liable\nfor the violation of a right that was not clearly established at\nthe time the violation occurred.\n\n     Qualified immunity “is only an immunity from a suit for\nmoney damages, and does not provide immunity from a suit\nseeking declaratory or injunctive relief.” Hydrick v. Hunter,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620818\"><a href=\"/opinion/620818/hydrick-v-hunter/\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 939–40 (9th Cir. 2012). We affirm the district\ncourt’s summary judgment on Brown’s claim for declaratory\nrelief, however, because the record shows that Brown has\nbeen released from the IMU and there is no evidence that he\nis likely to again be subject to the challenged conditions.
