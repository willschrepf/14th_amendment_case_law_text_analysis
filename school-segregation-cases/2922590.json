GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.         13887\n                         OPINION\n\nGOODWIN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Kris Indergard (“Indergard”) appeals a summary judgment\nin favor of Georgia-Pacific Corporation (“GP”) in her action\nfor damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(“ADA”) and Oregon disability law. GP argues that there was\nno error in the district court, and that Indergard failed to\nexhaust administrative remedies under the ADA. We have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we reverse.\n\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n   Indergard worked at GP’s Wauna mill facility from Decem-\nber 27, 1984, until February 8, 2006. On December 9, 2003,\nshe took medical leave to undergo surgery for work-related\nand non-work related injuries to her knees. She remained on\nmedical leave until March 21, 2005, when her orthopedic sur-\ngeon, Dr. Randall Ketzler, authorized her return to work, but\nwith permanent restrictions. GP policy required employees to\nparticipate in a physical capacity evaluation (PCE) before\nreturning to work from medical leave, and GP so informed\nIndergard.\n\n   GP contracted Columbia Rehabilitation (“Columbia”), an\nindependent occupational therapy provider located in Wash-\nington state, to conduct the PCE. Cory Blickenstaff, a physi-\ncal therapist at Columbia, visited the GP facility and\nconducted a job analysis for the Consumer Napkin Operator\nposition, which was Indergard’s position prior to her medical\nleave, and for the Napkin Adjuster position, which was the\nnext position for which Indergard was entitled to bid under\nthe collective bargaining agreement. Blickenstaff interviewed\nemployees who worked in these positions, and identified the\nphysical demands of the positions, including amount of\nweight an employee was required to lift, carry, push, pull, and\nhold, and the type of movements the positions required.\n\f13888         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\n   Among the lifting requirements that Blickenstaff identified\nwere a sixty-five pound individual lift and carry for the Con-\nsumer Napkin Operator position and a seventy-five pound lift\nfor the Napkin Adjuster position. In light of these require-\nments, Columbia determined that Indergard’s permanent\nrestrictions prevented her from participating in the PCE.\nIndergard met with GP supervisors and challenged the lifting\nrequirements in the job analyses, alleging that they were inac-\ncurate based on how the jobs were actually performed. Blick-\nenstaff prepared a supplemental memorandum intended to\nclarify the requirements, but the job analyses were not\nrevised.\n\n   On October 11, 2005, Indergard provided GP with a note\nfrom Dr. Ketzler that removed the permanent restrictions he\nhad previously identified. GP then scheduled her to partici-\npate in the PCE. Vicky Starnes, a state-licensed occupational\ntherapist at Columbia, conducted the PCE at Columbia’s\noffice on November 9 and 10, 2005.\n\n   On the first day of the PCE, Starnes recorded Indergard’s\nmedical history and subjective reports of her current pain\nlevel and use of medication, alcohol, tobacco, and assistive\ndevices. Starnes recorded Indergard’s weight, height, blood\npressure, and resting pulse. She observed Indergard’s gait,\nbalance, and posture. She measured the range of motion in\nIndergard’s arms and legs, and compared the results to normal\nlimits. Starnes palpated Indergard’s knees and looked for\nedema in her legs, and performed manual muscle testing,\nrecording the results of Indergard’s hip flexors, knee exten-\nsors and flexors, bilateral internal and external hip rotation,\nand straight leg raises.\n\n   Next, Starnes measured Indergard’s ability to lift various\namounts of weight from floor to waist, waist to chest, and\nchest to overhead, and evaluated Indergard’s body mechanics\nduring the lifts. She then measured Indergard’s ability to carry\nincreasing amounts of weight over a set distance, and her grip\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.          13889\nstrength over varying grip widths. She measured Indergard’s\nstatic strength to determine her ability to lift, push, and pull\nin various postures, and compared Indergard’s results to\nnorms adopted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices. Indergard then performed a “Job Simulation Task,”\nwhich required her to lift and pour five gallon buckets filled\nwith forty-five pounds of sand. Starnes then tested Inder-\ngard’s ability to place nuts and bolts in a box while kneeling\nwith her vision obscured, and observed Indergard’s ability to\nclimb stairs, stand, sit, kneel, squat, and crawl. Indergard\nwalked on a treadmill for twenty minutes at a 2.8 mile per\nhour pace, and pushed a weight sled. Finally, Starnes recorded\ndetails about Indergard’s vision, communication, cognitive\nability, hearing, attitude, and behavior.\n\n   The second day of the PCE included similar tests. Starnes\nmeasured and recorded Indergard’s heart rate after she per-\nformed the treadmill test, and noted that she required “in-\ncreased oxygen” and demonstrated “poor aerobic fitness.”\nStarnes concluded that Indergard was unable to perform the\nsixty-five pound lift and carry that Blickenstaff had identified\nas a requirement of the Napkin Operator position, or the\nseventy-five pound lift that Blickenstaff identified as a\nrequirement for the Napkin Adjuster position. Starnes recom-\nmended that Indergard not return to work, and forwarded the\nresults of the PCE to Dr. Ketzler, who agreed with Starnes’s\nassessment. The lifting requirements that the PCE indicated\nIndergard could not meet were those that she had previously\ncontested as inaccurate.\n\n   GP then informed Indergard that she could not return to\neither position, and that no other positions were available for\nwhich she was qualified. On February 8, 2006, GP terminated\nher employment pursuant to a provision in the collective bar-\ngaining agreement that allowed GP to terminate employees\nwho had been on leave for more than two years. Indergard\nfiled a union grievance, which was denied, and filed a joint\ncomplaint with the EEOC and BOLI. The administrative\n\f13890             INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\ninvestigation found no substantial evidence to support her\nclaims. She received right to sue letters, and filed this action.\n\n   Indergard alleged various claims of disability discrimina-\ntion under the ADA and Oregon disability law. Relevant to\nthis appeal, she alleged that GP misrepresented the essential\njob functions of the position in which she had worked prior\nto going on medical leave, forced her to participate in the PCE\nwithout “an objectively reasonable basis for doing so,” and\nrefused to allow her to return to employment after the PCE.\nIn her first claim for relief, Indergard alleged that the PCE\nwas improper and discriminatory, and that GP relied on the\nPCE to “remove and/or deny” her return to employment. She\nalso raised other claims under the ADA, including that GP\ntreated her “in a disparate, discriminating and harassing man-\nner” because she was disabled, had a record of disability or\nwas perceived as disabled, and that GP failed to engage in the\ninteractive process. She sought relief in the form of loss of\nincome, and $250,000 in non-economic damages.\n\n   GP moved for summary judgment, and Indergard’s\nresponse abandoned all claims except those alleging that the\nPCE was an improper medical examination and that GP dis-\ncriminated against her because of a perceived disability or\nrecord of disability. GP’s reply argued that the PCE was not\na medical examination, and that it therefore did not violate the\nADA. It further argued that even if the PCE was a medical\nexamination, it was job-related and consistent with business\nnecessity, and therefore expressly allowed by the ADA. See\n42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A).1\n  1\n   (A) Prohibited examinations and inquiries\n      A covered entity shall not require a medical examination and\n      shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether such\n      employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or\n      severity of the disability, unless such examination or inquiry is\n      shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A).\n\f                 INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.             13891\n   The magistrate judge agreed with GP that the PCE was not\na medical examination. Because the magistrate judge deter-\nmined that the PCE was not a medical examination, he con-\ncluded that GP had not violated 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A)\nand that it was entitled to summary judgment. In the interest\nof providing a thorough analysis, however, the magistrate\njudge analyzed GP’s business necessity defense. Noting that\nthe standard to establish business necessity is “quite high,” the\nmagistrate judge found that although GP had a reasonable\nbasis to request the PCE, it “would not be entitled to summary\njudgment on the basis of the business necessity defense\nbecause [GP] failed to show that the PCE was limited to the\nessential functions” of Indergard’s prior positions. The magis-\ntrate judge, however, decided that GP was nonetheless enti-\ntled to summary judgment because the PCE was not a medical\nexamination.\n\n  Indergard filed objections, but the district court adopted the\nFindings and Recommendation in full and granted GP’s\nmotion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.2\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\nI.       The district court erred in holding that the PCE was\n         not a medical examination under the ADA\n\n   [1] Under the ADA, an employer may not require a current\nemployee to undergo a medical examination unless the exami-\nnation “is shown to be job-related and consistent with busi-\nness necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). This section\napplies to all employees, whether or not they are disabled\nunder the ADA. Fredenburg v. Contra Costa County Dep’t of\nHealth Servs., 172 F.3d 1176, 1182-82 (9th Cir. 1999). The\nimplementing regulations impose the same restriction, but\nstate that an employer “may make inquiries into the ability of\n     2\n  Indergard does not appeal the district court’s grant of summary judg-\nment on her discrimination based on perceived disability claim.\n\f13892         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nan employee to perform job-related functions.” 29 C.F.R.\n§ 1630.14(c). Thus, we must determine whether the PCE was\na medical examination under the ADA or simply an inquiry\ninto whether Indergard was capable of performing the job-\nrelated functions of the positions she was qualified to return\nto after her medical leave.\n\n  A.    Regulatory guidance indicates that the PCE was a\n        medical examination\n\n   Neither the ADA nor the implementing regulations define\nthe term “medical examination,” and case law interpreting\nthis provision is limited. Agency guidance on the issue, how-\never, is more detailed. Although agency guidance documents\nare “not controlling upon courts by reason of their authority,\n[they] do constitute a body of experience and informed judg-\nment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for\nguidance.” Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65\n(1986) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see\nalso Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000)\n(stating that “interpretations contained in policy statements,\nagency manuals, and enforcement guidelines . . . are ‘entitled\nto respect’ . . . only to the extent that [they] have the power\nto persuade”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n   [2] The interpretive appendix to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.14(c)\nstates, in relevant part, that “[t]his provision permits employ-\ners to make inquiries or require medical examinations (fitness\nfor duty exams) when there is a need to determine whether an\nemployee is still able to perform the essential functions of his\nor her job.” 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.14(c). The inter-\npretive appendix to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.14(a) also contemplates\nthe use of “[p]hysical agility tests,” which “are not medical\nexaminations and so may be given at any point in the applica-\ntion or employment process.” Id. at App. § 1630.14(a). The\nappendix further states that physical agility tests “must be\ngiven to all similarly situated applicants or employees regard-\nless of disability,” and notes that if the test “screen[s] out or\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.         13893\ntend[s] to screen out an individual with a disability . . . the\nemployer would have to demonstrate that the test is job-\nrelated and consistent with business necessity and that perfor-\nmance cannot be achieved with reasonable accommodation.”\nId.\n\n   [3] EEOC Enforcement Guidance draws a further distinc-\ntion between medical examinations and physical agility tests.\nIt defines a medical examination as “a procedure or test that\nseeks information about an individual’s physical or mental\nimpairments or health.” Enforcement Guidance on Disability-\nRelated Inquiries and Medical Examinations, available at\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/guidance-inquiries.html\n[hereinafter “EEOC Enforcement Guidance”]. It provides the\nfollowing seven factors to be considered in determining\nwhether a test is a medical examination:\n\n    (1) whether the test is administered by a health care\n    professional\n\n    (2) whether the test is interpreted by a health care\n    professional\n\n    (3) whether the test is designed to reveal an impair-\n    ment of physical or mental health\n\n    (4) whether the test is invasive\n\n    (5) whether the test measures an employee’s perfor-\n    mance of a task or measures his/her physiological\n    responses to performing the task\n\n    (6) whether the test normally is given in a medical\n    setting\n\n    (7) whether medical equipment is used\n\nId. The EEOC Enforcement Guidance states that although in\nsome cases a combination of factors may be relevant to the\n\f13894          INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\ndetermination of whether a test is a medical examination, in\n“other cases, one factor may be enough to determine that a\ntest or procedure is medical.” Id. It then provides a list of tests\nconsidered medical examinations, including “blood pressure\nscreening and cholesterol testing” and “range-of-motion tests\nthat measure muscle strength and motor function.” Id.\n\n   [4] The EEOC Enforcement Guidance states that certain\nemployer-required tests are generally not medical examina-\ntions, including\n\n    physical agility tests, which measure an employee’s\n    ability to perform actual or simulated job tasks, and\n    physical fitness tests, which measure an employee’s\n    performance of physical tasks, such as running or\n    lifting, as long as these tests do not include examina-\n    tions that could be considered medical (e.g., measur-\n    ing heart rate or blood pressure).\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n    1.   Single factors establish that the PCE was a medi-\n         cal examination\n\n   [5] In light of the agency guidance, Indergard’s argument\nthat the PCE was a medical examination is convincing. As\nnoted above, the PCE included range of motion and muscle\nstrength tests, and Starnes measured Indergard’s heart rate\nand recorded an observation about her breathing after the\ntreadmill test. Each of these tests is within the EEOC’s\ndescription of tests that are considered medical examinations.\nThe post-treadmill test heart rate measurement and notation\nregarding Indergard’s “increased oxygen” intake and demon-\nstration of “poor aerobic fitness” weigh heavily in favor of\nconsidering the PCE a medical exam, particularly because\nStarnes had already noted that Indergard “was able to walk for\n20 minutes at 2.8 mph on treadmill without increased antalgic\nbehavior or objective findings of pain complaints noted.” Had\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.          13895\nStarnes’s observations ended there, it might be appropriate to\ncharacterize the treadmill test as a test that measured Inder-\ngard’s performance of a physical task. Measuring Indergard’s\nheart rate and recording observations about her breathing and\naerobic fitness, however, was not only unnecessary to deter-\nmine whether she could perform the task, but is also the kind\nof examination that the EEOC Enforcement Guidance identi-\nfies as inappropriate to include in a non-medical physical agil-\nity or fitness test.\n\n   GP’s argument that anything less than a “genuine exercise\nstress test” is not a medical examination distorts the EEOC\nEnforcement Guidance and is not well-taken. Furthermore, to\nthe extent that GP attempts to rely on the magistrate judge’s\nconclusion that Indergard’s blood pressure and heart rate were\nmeasured as an “overall precaution before beginning testing\nrather than to measure [Indergard’s] physiological response to\nthe performance portion of the PCE,” we emphasize that her\nheart rate was taken both before and after the treadmill test,\nand we note that although it might be a prudent medical pro-\ncedure to take these physiological measurements, including\nthem in the report provided to GP was unnecessary for the\npurpose of determining whether Indergard was physically\ncapable of performing her job duties.\n\n    2.   Application of the seven-factor test establishes\n         that the PCE was a medical examination\n\n   [6] The EEOC Enforcement Guidance identifies seven fac-\ntors as relevant to determining whether a test is a medical\nexamination, and at least four weigh in Indergard’s favor.\nFirst, although Starnes is not a medical doctor, she is a\nlicensed occupational therapist. Nothing in the EEOC\nEnforcement Guidance indicates that the term “health care\nprofessional” should be limited to only doctors, and at least\none district court has found that the fact that a PCE “was\nadministered by a business specializing in physical therapy,\nand not a medical doctor, makes it no less ‘medical’ than a\n\f13896         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nnurse taking one’s blood pressure or an emergency medical\ntechnician administering care to a patient on the way to the\nhospital.” Medlin v. Rome Strip Steel Co., 294 F. Supp. 2d\n279, 294 (N.D.N.Y. 2003).\n\n   [7] Second, not only did Starnes administer the PCE, but\nshe interpreted Indergard’s performance and recommended\nthat she not return to work. Furthermore, Starnes submitted\nthe test results to Dr. Ketzler, Indergard’s treating orthopedic\nsurgeon, who indicated his agreement with Starnes’s recom-\nmendation. This distinguishes the PCE from a test where, for\nexample, a supervisor or other employee might observe the\nemployee’s physical ability to perform job tasks.\n\n   [8] Third, although the PCE was ostensibly intended to\ndetermine whether Indergard could return to work, the broad\nreach of the test was capable of revealing impairments of her\nphysical and mental health, particularly in light of Starnes\nrecording Indergard’s subjective reports of her current pain\nlevel, use of medication and assistive devices, and communi-\ncation, cognitive ability, attitude, and behavior.\n\n   [9] The fourth factor weighs in GP’s favor, as the PCE does\nnot seem to have been invasive. The fifth factor, however,\nbenefits Indergard because Starnes recorded her heart rate and\nbreathing pattern after the treadmill test, and Indergard’s mus-\ncle pain and stiffness after the first day of testing. These are\nmeasurements of Indergard’s physiological response to her\nperformance of a task and, as discussed above, go beyond col-\nlecting information necessary to determine whether Indergard\nwas physically capable of performing the task. We express no\nopinion on the sixth factor, except to note that the offices of\na licensed occupational therapist are more like a medical set-\nting than, for example, an employee’s work place.\n\n   [10] Finally, it is unclear whether the final factor favors\neither party, because the only evidence that medical equip-\nment was used in the PCE is Starnes’s use of a blood pressure\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.          13897\ncuff at the beginning of the PCE. Thus, viewed in the light\nmost favorable to Indergard, applying the balancing factors\nestablishes that the PCE was a medical examination.\n\n  B.   The limited case law available establishes that the\n       PCE was a medical examination\n\n   [11] Most cases interpreting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A)\naddress the question of whether an admitted medical examina-\ntion was job related and consistent with business necessity.\nSee, e.g., Yin v. California, 95 F.3d 864, 868 (9th Cir. 1996)\n(following the district court in assuming that the proposed\nexamination was a medical examination within the meaning\nof 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A)).\n\n  The case most on point is Medlin, 294 F. Supp. 2d at\n293-94. Medlin, an employee, had been on medical leave after\na back injury. Id. at 284. Prior to returning to work, his\nemployer required him to undergo a functional capacity eval-\nuation (“FCE”) to determine whether his residual functional\ncapacity met the job requirements for the position he previ-\nously held. Id. at 285. The FCE results revealed that Medlin\nwas “unable to maintain safe work practices or a heart rate\nprofile required for the level of repetitions and duration for a\ncomplete Hot Role Slitter setup.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Medlin sued, alleging in part that the employer\nmade an improper disclosure of his medical information in\nviolation of the ADA when it made the results of the FCE\nknown to other employees. Id. at 293.\n\n   The court stated that the FCE was clearly job related and\nconsistent with business necessity, but noted that it was\nunclear whether it qualified as a medical examination. Id.\nWithout reaching a definitive conclusion, the court noted that\nEEOC guidance and case law had indicated “that testing\nordered by the employer that physically or mentally tests an\nemployee’s ability to perform his or her job are permissible\ntests under the ADA.” Id. at 293-94 (citing 29 C.F.R. Pt.\n\f13898         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\n1630, § 1630.13(b); Sullivan v. River Valley Sch. Dist., 197\nF.3d 804, 811 (6th Cir. 1999)). The court then found that\nbecause the sole purpose of the FCE was to determine\nwhether Medlin “could physically return to work without any\nrestrictions” and was “in essence and in reality, a fitness for\nduty exam,” it therefore was likely a medical examination. Id.\nat 294.\n\n    GP argues that because the FCE in Medlin was adminis-\ntered to determine whether the employee could perform the\nphysical demands of his position without any restrictions, it\nwas designed to test the level of his disability and is therefore\ndistinguishable from the PCE in this case. This distinction is\nunpersuasive. Although the court did state that the purpose of\nthe FCE was to determine whether Medlin “could physically\nreturn to work without any restrictions,” id., it was adminis-\ntered to an injured employee returning from medical leave in\norder to ascertain whether he was capable of performing the\nphysical demands of his position. Id. at 284-86. Thus, there is\nlittle to distinguish the FCE at issue in Medlin from the PCE\nat issue here.\n\n   Furthermore, the Second Circuit has held that an employ-\ner’s policy that all employees returning from sick leave pro-\nvide a medical certification that included a “brief general\ndiagnosis that is ‘sufficiently informative as to allow [the\nDepartment of Correctional Services] to make a determination\nconcerning the employee’s entitlement to leave’ ” was “suffi-\ncient to trigger the protections of the ADA under [42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(d)(4)(A)]” because the general diagnosis “may tend\nto reveal a disability.” Conroy v. New York Dep’t of Corr.\nServ., 333 F.3d 88, 92, 95-96 (2d Cir. 2003). Although Con-\nroy was interpreting the provision in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(d)(4)(A) that prohibits an employer from making “in-\nquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an\nindividual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of\nthe disability” and is not directly on point, its reasoning is\nuseful to the extent that portions of Indergard’s PCE went\n\f                 INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.                  13899\nbeyond simply measuring her physical ability to perform job\ntasks and could have revealed a disability.\n\n   [12] The purpose of the PCE may very well have been to\ndetermine whether Indergard was capable of returning to\nwork. The substance of the PCE, however, clearly sought “in-\nformation about [Indergard’s] physical or mental impairments\nor health,” see EEOC Enforcement Guidance, and involved\ntests and inquiries capable of revealing to GP whether she suf-\nfered from a disability. Therefore, we hold that the PCE was\na medical examination under 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A).3\n  3\n   The dissent predicts a parade of lawsuit horribles for employers if\nIndergard’s PCE is held to be a medical examination within the meaning\nof 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). To reach this conclusion, the dissent disre-\ngards statutory language and commentary by dividing the comprehensive\nPCE into its component tests for analysis. In addition, the dissent would\nrequire Indergard to show that a particular component test was a medical\nexamination that proximately caused her to lose her job, a rationale that\nhas not been adopted in this circuit.\n   “The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by ref-\nerence to the language itself, the specific context in which that language\nis used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Robinson v.\nShell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997). The statute provides that an\nemployer “shall not require a medical examination . . . unless such exami-\nnation . . . is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessi-\nty.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). The EEOC Enforcement Guidance for\n§ 12112(d)(4)(A) clarifies that testing blood pressure, cholesterol, muscle\nstrength, and motor function specifically are designated as medical exami-\nnations. “The whole purpose of placing a person on leave is that he or she\nmay eventually return to work.” Fredenburg, 172 F.3d at 1181.\n   “The ADA was enacted in 1992 ‘to provide a clear and comprehensive\nnational mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals\nwith disabilities.’ ” Yin, 95 F.3d at 867 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)).\nThe ADA provisions that prohibit using medical examinations to discrimi-\nnate in hiring or retaining employees protect all employees from being\nstigmatized by their disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d); see Fredenburg,\n172 F.3d at 1182 (“protecting only qualified individuals would defeat\nmuch of the usefulness of [the medical examination provisions]”). The\ndissent’s method of dividing Indergard’s PCE into component parts and\nengaging in proximate-cause analysis creates a risk that employers would\n\f13900            INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nII.   Exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\n   GP argues that Indergard failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies because her joint EEOC/BOLI complaint did not\nprovide requisite notice of the unlawful medical examination\nclaim. Indergard argues that the court should not reach this\nissue because she has alleged identical claims under Oregon’s\nstate disability law, which is substantively the same as federal\n\nseek to obtain medical information in tests that are not job-related and\nthereby escape liability by asserting that their employment decisions were\nbased on information revealed in non-medical components of the evalua-\ntion. This would promote unnecessary litigation, contravene the statutory\nprophylactic purpose, and deter disabled employees from returning to\nwork following medical leave, because of concern for being stigmatized\nby their disabilities.\n   Indergard was given a treadmill/blood-pressure test, which is used to\ndetect arterial blockages that could result in open-heart surgery. Unques-\ntionably, this is a medical examination, and taking blood pressure follow-\ning treadmill exertion is a critical part of the test not to be separated from\nit. Yet, the dissent segregates the blood-pressure test from this standard\nmedical procedure and re-characterizes it as incidental or a technical viola-\ntion of § 12112(d)(4)(A). While testing blood pressure is explicitly desig-\nnated in the statutory commentary as being a medical examination, the\ntherapist, who administered the PCE, took many physiological measure-\nments during the two-day testing, given as a composite examination.\nAvoiding the statutory language, commentary, and purpose, the dissent\nendeavors to convert the two-day PCE into a physical agility test, which\nemployers can give at any time, by dividing it into its component tests and\nanalyzing them separately.\n  Using this cut-and-divide approach, for which the dissent gives no\nauthority, not only dispenses with Indergard’s blood-pressure test as inci-\ndental but also focuses on her weight-lifting testing as the basis or proxi-\nmate cause for her termination. The therapist, who administered the PCE,\ndetermined that Indergard could not accomplish the 65-pound lift and\ncarry nor the 75-pound lift, respectively required for her former Consumer\nNapkin Operator position or the Napkin Adjuster position, for which she\nwould have been entitled to bid under the applicable collective bargaining\nagreement. Indergard’s doctor had deemed her able to return to work and\nsubsequently agreed with her termination, based solely on the weight lift-\ning purportedly required for the two jobs.\n\f                 INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.                  13901\nlaw but does not require administrative exhaustion, that GP\nwaived the failure to exhaust argument by way of a judicial\nadmission in its answer, that GP did not allege failure to\nexhaust as an affirmative defense, and that because the EEOC\nwould have addressed the medical examination in the scope\nof its investigation, the claim was properly before the district\ncourt.\n\n   Because the magistrate judge determined that the PCE was\nnot a medical examination, he declined to reach GP’s argu-\nment that Indergard failed to exhaust her administrative reme-\ndies with respect to this claim. In remanding this case, we do\nnot express any view on this argument, and the issue remains\nopen for the district court’s consideration.\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n   [13] We hold that the PCE was a medical examination\nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). Because\nthe magistrate judge correctly found that a triable issue of fact\nremained on the question of whether the PCE was job related\nand consistent with business necessity, the summary judgment\n\n   This circuit has not adopted a proximate-causation requirement in the\ncontext of § 12112(d)(4)(A). The dissent’s reliance on Armstrong v. Tur-\nner Industries, Inc., 141 F.3d 554, 562 (5th Cir. 1998), is inapposite\nbecause Turner concerned a pre-employment examination and not an\nemployee’s returning to work from medical leave. An employee, who has\nworked for a company, has more invested in that employment, including\nbenefits, than an applicant for employment. Therefore, the employee has\nmore to lose by job termination than an applicant, and the employee also\neffectively has been penalized for a medical absence, when his or her job\nis lost upon return to work. Using its component-test analysis, the dissent\ninsists that Indergard has no cause of action, but she did lose her job when\nshe returned from medical leave because of the subject PCE. The dissent\ncannot inject into the plain statutory language a contrived proximate-cause\nrequirement. As GP notes, proximate cause “is not an issue the Court\nneeds to decide in this appeal” before initial determination by the district\ncourt and briefing on appeal. Appellee’s Br. at 22 n.5. Treating the two-\nday PCE as a whole, rather than analyzing its discrete tests, promotes the\ndeterrent purpose behind § 12112(d)(4)(A).\n\f13902            INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nwas inappropriate. We vacate the judgment and remand the\ncase to the district court to determine whether the PCE was\njob related and consistent with business necessity, and to\ndetermine whether Indergard exhausted administrative reme-\ndies.\n\n   VACATED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\nO’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n  The essential distinction between a medical examination\nand a physical fitness or agility test, for the purposes of the\n\n   Moreover, Indergard continues to argue on appeal that the 65-pound\nweight-lifting test for the Consumer Napkin Operator position, which was\nher job, and the 75-pound weight-lifting test for the Napkin Adjuster posi-\ntion are inaccurate weight requirements for these jobs. On summary judg-\nment review, Indergard’s statement of the weight requirements for the\nrespective jobs must be accepted. Cripe v. City of San Jose, 261 F.3d 877,\n895 (9th Cir. 2001). Because Indergard’s inability to lift these weights\nresulted in her termination, the weight-requirement discrepancy for the\ntwo positions is a genuine issue of material fact, which precludes summary\njudgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c); Cripe, 261 F.3d at 894-95. On remand,\nthe district court can make this factual determination in deciding whether\nIndergard’s medical examination was “job related and consistent with\nbusiness necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). GP has the burden of\nproving that the PCE weight lifting it required for the two positions satis-\nfies the business necessity defense, which “is quite high, and is not to be\nconfused with mere expediency.” Cripe, 261 F.3d at 890 (citation, internal\nquotation marks, and alteration omitted); see EEOC v. Prevo’s Family\nMarket, Inc., 135 F.3d 1089, 1091-92 & n.3 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that\nfamily-owned grocery store did not violate § 12112(d)(4)(A) in terminat-\ning produce clerk for failing to have a medical examination to determine\nif he was HIV-positive, when the job involved use of “paring knives, chef\nknives, cleavers and pineapple corers, all of which are shared by the\nclerks,” and the parties “agree[d] that produce clerks often cut themselves\nin the course of their regular duties”). The dissent’s upholding summary\njudgment for GP in this case defeats the statutory purpose of\n§ 12112(d)(4)(A) by creating a pretext by which employers could misuse\nmedical examinations to discriminate against disabled employees return-\ning to work from medical leave.\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.           13903\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), is that the former\nis designed to reveal disability, while the latter is designed to\ndetermine whether an employee can perform her job. I cannot\nconclude that the evaluation Kris Indergard underwent on her\nreturn to work at Georgia-Pacific was a medical examination\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A), for it was not designed to\nreveal disability. Furthermore, even assuming that there were\nany “medical” aspects of the physical capacity evaluation\n(“PCE”), they were merely incidental to the physical agility\naspects and did not in any way cause the harms that Indergard\nalleges. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n                                I\n\n   Indergard characterizes the PCE as “two days of testing,\npoking, palpating, and examining.” However, over the course\nof those two days, no blood was drawn, no urine samples col-\nlected, no labwork performed, and no x-rays or scans taken.\nNo doctor or nurse ever examined, diagnosed, or treated her.\nInstead, she went to an occupational therapy facility and per-\nformed various physical tasks designed to determine whether\nshe could safely perform the duties of her old job. Such test-\ning was unquestionably advisable given her own physician’s\npermanent restrictions on climbing, kneeling, squatting,\ncrawling, and lifting over thirty pounds. A common-sense\nreading of the term “medical examination” would not include\nthis PCE.\n\n   Unfortunately, common sense plays no role in our ADA\njurisprudence. Instead, the EEOC has muddied the jurispru-\ndential waters by issuing “guidances” that appear to read the\nword “medical” right out of the statute. For example, the\ninterpretive appendix to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.14(a) first states\nthat “[p]hysical agility tests are not medical examinations” but\nthen adds that “[i]f such tests screen out or tend to screen out\nindividuals with disabilities, the employer would have to\ndemonstrate that the test is job-related and consistent with\nbusiness necessity . . . .” Apparently, having a tendency to\n\f13904         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nscreen out disabled individuals automatically converts a phys-\nical agility test into a medical examination subject to the\nADA. Given that physical agility tests by their very nature\ntend to screen out people with certain disabilities, I see no\nway for employers to conduct such tests without inviting\nADA lawsuits from those who fail them.\n\n   In addition, an EEOC enforcement guidance defines a med-\nical examination as “a procedure or test that seeks information\nabout an individual’s physical or mental impairments or\nhealth.” EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related\nInquiries and Medical Evaluations, available at\nhttp://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/guidance-inquiries.html [hereinaf-\nter Enforcement Guidance]. Under this broad definition, any\nreturn-to-work test would necessarily qualify as a medical\nexamination because it seeks to determine whether the\nemployee is fit enough to resume her duties. Employers seek-\ning to avoid ADA lawsuits would have to allow injured work-\ners to return to the job without being able to verify their\nfitness for duty, creating the potential for re-injury.\n\n   The Enforcement Guidance also declares physical agility\ntests not to be medical examinations “as long as these tests do\nnot include examinations that could be considered medical\n(e.g., measuring heart rate or blood pressure).” Hence, a sin-\ngle pulse measurement taken over the course of a two-day\nphysical agility test would be sufficient to convert such test\ninto a medical examination. If an employee taking a physical\nagility test shows obvious distress, the examiner would not be\nable to take her pulse or blood pressure as a precautionary\nmeasure without implicating the ADA. Employers seeking to\nensure returning workers’ safety must therefore navigate the\nprecarious straits between the Scylla of ADA liability and the\nCharybdis of a negligence lawsuit. Fearing either form of lia-\nbility, employers may very well decline to conduct any form\nof testing, thereby increasing the risk of returning worker\ninjury.\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.         13905\n   The majority uncritically accepts these agency pronounce-\nments as gospel, even though we owe them no deference\nwhen they subvert the plain text of the statute. See Gen.\nDynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, 540 U.S. 581, 600 (2004).\nI decline to read the statute in such a way as to render a term\nentirely meaningless.\n\n                              II\n\n   Turning to the PCE at issue in this case, I am not persuaded\nthat it can be considered a medical examination merely by vir-\ntue of the “single factors” that the majority lists: range-of-\nmotion and muscle strength tests, pulse measurement after a\ntreadmill test, and observations about Indergard’s breathing\nafter the treadmill test. It is important to remember that the\nPCE was a two-day examination comprising numerous tests.\nWhile one or two of these measurements may arguably have\nbeen medical in nature, these were at most de minimis com-\nponents that were incidental to the physical tasks that formed\nthe bulk of the PCE.\n\n   Furthermore, application of the seven-factor test also does\nnot convince me that the PCE as a whole was a medical\nexamination. In particular, I disagree with the majority’s con-\nclusions regarding factors three, five, and seven. Factor three\nasks “whether the test is designed to reveal an impairment in\nphysical or mental health.” Enforcement Guidance. According\nto the majority, “although the PCE was ostensibly intended to\ndetermine whether Indergard could return to work, the broad\nreach of the test was capable of revealing impairments of her\nphysical and mental health.” Maj. op. at 13896. Here the\nmajority appears to confuse intent with effect. Because the\nmajority believes that the PCE could reveal an impairment, it\nassumes that Georgia-Pacific intended for it to do so. I do not\nread factor three so broadly. With respect to factors five and\nseven, any measurement of physiological response and use of\nmedical equipment were de minimis in the overall context of\n\f13906           INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nthe two-day PCE. On balance, the PCE looks overwhelmingly\nmore like a physical agility test than a medical examination.\n\n                                  III\n\n   In my view, the PCE cannot be considered a single exami-\nnation but rather a battery of individual tests. By its viewing\nof the PCE, the majority allows Indergard to proceed with her\nsuit even though she has shown no injury resulting from the\nallegedly medical tests. However, it was unquestionably the\nlifting task that scuttled Indergard’s return to work, not her\npulse rate after the treadmill test or her knee flexion. Because\nshe has suffered no injury from the parts of the test that alleg-\nedly were medical examinations, she cannot maintain a claim\nfor a violation of § 12112(d).\n\n   Our sister circuits have agreed that a plaintiff seeking relief\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d) must be able to show “something\nmore than a mere violation of that provision. There must be\nsome cognizable injury in fact of which the violation is a legal\nand proximate cause for damages to arise from a single viola-\ntion.” Armstrong v. Turner Indus., Inc., 141 F.3d 554, 562\n(5th Cir. 1998); see also Tice v. Centre Area Transp. Auth.,\n247 F.3d 506, 519 (3d Cir. 2001); Cossette v. Minnesota\nPower & Light, 188 F.3d 964, 970 (8th Cir. 1999); Griffin v.\nSteeltek, Inc., 160 F.3d 591, 594-95 (10th Cir. 1998). In other\nwords, “a technical violation” is not enough. Tice, 247 F.3d\nat 520. Here, even assuming that Georgia-Pacific technically\nviolated § 12112(d)(4)(A) by measuring Indergard’s pulse\nand range of motion, she has made no showing that such mea-\nsurements have proximately caused her to lose her job. There-\nfore, any such measurements “presents no ‘injury’ capable of\nremedy, and thus affords no basis for suit.” Id. at 519.\n\n  Armstrong is instructive because it presents a scenario anal-\nogous to this case, albeit in the context of preemployment\nmedical inquiries.1 Armstrong had applied for a position as a\n  1\n   Preemployment medical inquiries and examinations fall under 42\nU.S.C. § 12112(d)(2) of the ADA. Although the majority attempts to dis-\n\f                 INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.                  13907\npipefitter and was asked questions in his application about\nprior injuries, his medical history, and worker’s compensation\nclaims. The questionnaire also asked whether he had “any\ninjury or condition not mentioned on this form,” and Arm-\nstrong answered “no.” A background check later revealed that\nArmstrong had previously reported “possible asbestos expo-\nsure,” and he was “rejected due to the provision of incorrect\nand/or incomplete information.” 141 F.3d at 556-57. Because\nthe failure to hire had not resulted directly from the prohibited\nmedical inquiries, the court held that Armstrong lacked stand-\ning to sue for damages and injunctive relief under\n§ 12112(d)(2)(A). Id. at 562-63. The court noted that the\nADA was not intended to protect employees from adverse\nemployment actions “incident to a prohibited section\n12112(d)(2)(A) inquiry.” Id. at 560 n.15.\n\n   Similarly, Indergard’s termination was merely incident to\nan alleged technical violation of § 12112(d)(4)(A). Had\nGeorgia-Pacific administered only the treadmill exercise and\nrange-of-motion tests, she would not have a cause of action\nunder the ADA even assuming that they are medical examina-\ntions because she suffered no adverse employment action\nfrom these tests. Conversely, had Georgia-Pacific adminis-\ntered the lifting task alone, she also would not have a cause\nof action because the lifting task is not a medical examination.\nOnly by yoking these tests together and attributing an injury\nfrom a permissible physical agility task to an allegedly\nimproper medical examination can Indergard manufacture an\nADA violation.\n\ntinguish Armstrong on this basis, see Maj. op. at 13901 n.3, the same anal-\nysis applies to all of the medical inquiry and examination provisions under\n42 U.S.C. § 12112(d). See Tice, 247 F.3d at 519 (“Other courts of appeal\nhave addressed the question whether a plaintiff has a cause of action for\na violation of § 12112(d) without demonstrating the existence of an injury-\nin-fact . . . . All have concluded that a violation of § 12112(d), without a\nshowing, presents no ‘injury’ capable of remedy, and thus affords no basis\nfor suit.”).\n\f13908         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\n                              IV\n\n   Because the majority renders the term “medical” meaning-\nless and allows a plaintiff to continue her $250,000 suit on the\nbasis of a pulse measurement that caused her no harm, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\f",

GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.         13887\n                         OPINION\n\nGOODWIN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Kris Indergard (“Indergard”) appeals a summary judgment\nin favor of Georgia-Pacific Corporation (“GP”) in her action\nfor damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(“ADA”) and Oregon disability law. GP argues that there was\nno error in the district court, and that Indergard failed to\nexhaust administrative remedies under the ADA. We have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we reverse.\n\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n   Indergard worked at GP’s Wauna mill facility from Decem-\nber 27, 1984, until February 8, 2006. On December 9, 2003,\nshe took medical leave to undergo surgery for work-related\nand non-work related injuries to her knees. She remained on\nmedical leave until March 21, 2005, when her orthopedic sur-\ngeon, Dr. Randall Ketzler, authorized her return to work, but\nwith permanent restrictions. GP policy required employees to\nparticipate in a physical capacity evaluation (PCE) before\nreturning to work from medical leave, and GP so informed\nIndergard.\n\n   GP contracted Columbia Rehabilitation (“Columbia”), an\nindependent occupational therapy provider located in Wash-\nington state, to conduct the PCE. Cory Blickenstaff, a physi-\ncal therapist at Columbia, visited the GP facility and\nconducted a job analysis for the Consumer Napkin Operator\nposition, which was Indergard’s position prior to her medical\nleave, and for the Napkin Adjuster position, which was the\nnext position for which Indergard was entitled to bid under\nthe collective bargaining agreement. Blickenstaff interviewed\nemployees who worked in these positions, and identified the\nphysical demands of the positions, including amount of\nweight an employee was required to lift, carry, push, pull, and\nhold, and the type of movements the positions required.\n\f13888         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\n   Among the lifting requirements that Blickenstaff identified\nwere a sixty-five pound individual lift and carry for the Con-\nsumer Napkin Operator position and a seventy-five pound lift\nfor the Napkin Adjuster position. In light of these require-\nments, Columbia determined that Indergard’s permanent\nrestrictions prevented her from participating in the PCE.\nIndergard met with GP supervisors and challenged the lifting\nrequirements in the job analyses, alleging that they were inac-\ncurate based on how the jobs were actually performed. Blick-\nenstaff prepared a supplemental memorandum intended to\nclarify the requirements, but the job analyses were not\nrevised.\n\n   On October 11, 2005, Indergard provided GP with a note\nfrom Dr. Ketzler that removed the permanent restrictions he\nhad previously identified. GP then scheduled her to partici-\npate in the PCE. Vicky Starnes, a state-licensed occupational\ntherapist at Columbia, conducted the PCE at Columbia’s\noffice on November 9 and 10, 2005.\n\n   On the first day of the PCE, Starnes recorded Indergard’s\nmedical history and subjective reports of her current pain\nlevel and use of medication, alcohol, tobacco, and assistive\ndevices. Starnes recorded Indergard’s weight, height, blood\npressure, and resting pulse. She observed Indergard’s gait,\nbalance, and posture. She measured the range of motion in\nIndergard’s arms and legs, and compared the results to normal\nlimits. Starnes palpated Indergard’s knees and looked for\nedema in her legs, and performed manual muscle testing,\nrecording the results of Indergard’s hip flexors, knee exten-\nsors and flexors, bilateral internal and external hip rotation,\nand straight leg raises.\n\n   Next, Starnes measured Indergard’s ability to lift various\namounts of weight from floor to waist, waist to chest, and\nchest to overhead, and evaluated Indergard’s body mechanics\nduring the lifts. She then measured Indergard’s ability to carry\nincreasing amounts of weight over a set distance, and her grip\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.          13889\nstrength over varying grip widths. She measured Indergard’s\nstatic strength to determine her ability to lift, push, and pull\nin various postures, and compared Indergard’s results to\nnorms adopted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices. Indergard then performed a “Job Simulation Task,”\nwhich required her to lift and pour five gallon buckets filled\nwith forty-five pounds of sand. Starnes then tested Inder-\ngard’s ability to place nuts and bolts in a box while kneeling\nwith her vision obscured, and observed Indergard’s ability to\nclimb stairs, stand, sit, kneel, squat, and crawl. Indergard\nwalked on a treadmill for twenty minutes at a 2.8 mile per\nhour pace, and pushed a weight sled. Finally, Starnes recorded\ndetails about Indergard’s vision, communication, cognitive\nability, hearing, attitude, and behavior.\n\n   The second day of the PCE included similar tests. Starnes\nmeasured and recorded Indergard’s heart rate after she per-\nformed the treadmill test, and noted that she required “in-\ncreased oxygen” and demonstrated “poor aerobic fitness.”\nStarnes concluded that Indergard was unable to perform the\nsixty-five pound lift and carry that Blickenstaff had identified\nas a requirement of the Napkin Operator position, or the\nseventy-five pound lift that Blickenstaff identified as a\nrequirement for the Napkin Adjuster position. Starnes recom-\nmended that Indergard not return to work, and forwarded the\nresults of the PCE to Dr. Ketzler, who agreed with Starnes’s\nassessment. The lifting requirements that the PCE indicated\nIndergard could not meet were those that she had previously\ncontested as inaccurate.\n\n   GP then informed Indergard that she could not return to\neither position, and that no other positions were available for\nwhich she was qualified. On February 8, 2006, GP terminated\nher employment pursuant to a provision in the collective bar-\ngaining agreement that allowed GP to terminate employees\nwho had been on leave for more than two years. Indergard\nfiled a union grievance, which was denied, and filed a joint\ncomplaint with the EEOC and BOLI. The administrative\n\f13890             INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\ninvestigation found no substantial evidence to support her\nclaims. She received right to sue letters, and filed this action.\n\n   Indergard alleged various claims of disability discrimina-\ntion under the ADA and Oregon disability law. Relevant to\nthis appeal, she alleged that GP misrepresented the essential\njob functions of the position in which she had worked prior\nto going on medical leave, forced her to participate in the PCE\nwithout “an objectively reasonable basis for doing so,” and\nrefused to allow her to return to employment after the PCE.\nIn her first claim for relief, Indergard alleged that the PCE\nwas improper and discriminatory, and that GP relied on the\nPCE to “remove and/or deny” her return to employment. She\nalso raised other claims under the ADA, including that GP\ntreated her “in a disparate, discriminating and harassing man-\nner” because she was disabled, had a record of disability or\nwas perceived as disabled, and that GP failed to engage in the\ninteractive process. She sought relief in the form of loss of\nincome, and $250,000 in non-economic damages.\n\n   GP moved for summary judgment, and Indergard’s\nresponse abandoned all claims except those alleging that the\nPCE was an improper medical examination and that GP dis-\ncriminated against her because of a perceived disability or\nrecord of disability. GP’s reply argued that the PCE was not\na medical examination, and that it therefore did not violate the\nADA. It further argued that even if the PCE was a medical\nexamination, it was job-related and consistent with business\nnecessity, and therefore expressly allowed by the ADA. See\n42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A).1\n  1\n   (A) Prohibited examinations and inquiries\n      A covered entity shall not require a medical examination and\n      shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether such\n      employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or\n      severity of the disability, unless such examination or inquiry is\n      shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A).\n\f                 INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.             13891\n   The magistrate judge agreed with GP that the PCE was not\na medical examination. Because the magistrate judge deter-\nmined that the PCE was not a medical examination, he con-\ncluded that GP had not violated 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A)\nand that it was entitled to summary judgment. In the interest\nof providing a thorough analysis, however, the magistrate\njudge analyzed GP’s business necessity defense. Noting that\nthe standard to establish business necessity is “quite high,” the\nmagistrate judge found that although GP had a reasonable\nbasis to request the PCE, it “would not be entitled to summary\njudgment on the basis of the business necessity defense\nbecause [GP] failed to show that the PCE was limited to the\nessential functions” of Indergard’s prior positions. The magis-\ntrate judge, however, decided that GP was nonetheless enti-\ntled to summary judgment because the PCE was not a medical\nexamination.\n\n  Indergard filed objections, but the district court adopted the\nFindings and Recommendation in full and granted GP’s\nmotion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.2\n\n                          DISCUSSION\n\nI.       The district court erred in holding that the PCE was\n         not a medical examination under the ADA\n\n   [1] Under the ADA, an employer may not require a current\nemployee to undergo a medical examination unless the exami-\nnation “is shown to be job-related and consistent with busi-\nness necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). This section\napplies to all employees, whether or not they are disabled\nunder the ADA. Fredenburg v.

Thus, we must determine whether the PCE was\na medical examination under the ADA or simply an inquiry\ninto whether Indergard was capable of performing the job-\nrelated functions of the positions she was qualified to return\nto after her medical leave.\n\n  A.    Regulatory guidance indicates that the PCE was a\n        medical examination\n\n   Neither the ADA nor the implementing regulations define\nthe term “medical examination,” and case law interpreting\nthis provision is limited. Agency guidance on the issue, how-\never, is more detailed.

Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.14(c). The inter-\npretive appendix to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.14(a) also contemplates\nthe use of “[p]hysical agility tests,” which “are not medical\nexaminations and so may be given at any point in the applica-\ntion or employment process.” Id. at App. § 1630.14(a). The\nappendix further states that physical agility tests “must be\ngiven to all similarly situated applicants or employees regard-\nless of disability,” and notes that if the test “screen[s] out or\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.         13893\ntend[s] to screen out an individual with a disability . . . the\nemployer would have to demonstrate that the test is job-\nrelated and consistent with business necessity and that perfor-\nmance cannot be achieved with reasonable accommodation.”\nId.\n\n   [3] EEOC Enforcement Guidance draws a further distinc-\ntion between medical examinations and physical agility tests.\nIt defines a medical examination as “a procedure or test that\nseeks information about an individual’s physical or mental\nimpairments or health.” Enforcement Guidance on Disability-\nRelated Inquiries and Medical Examinations, available at\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/guidance-inquiries.html\n[hereinafter “EEOC Enforcement Guidance”]. It provides the\nfollowing seven factors to be considered in determining\nwhether a test is a medical examination:\n\n    (1) whether the test is administered by a health care\n    professional\n\n    (2) whether the test is interpreted by a health care\n    professional\n\n    (3) whether the test is designed to reveal an impair-\n    ment of physical or mental health\n\n    (4) whether the test is invasive\n\n    (5) whether the test measures an employee’s perfor-\n    mance of a task or measures his/her physiological\n    responses to performing the task\n\n    (6) whether the test normally is given in a medical\n    setting\n\n    (7) whether medical equipment is used\n\nId. The EEOC Enforcement Guidance states that although in\nsome cases a combination of factors may be relevant to the\n\f13894          INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\ndetermination of whether a test is a medical examination, in\n“other cases, one factor may be enough to determine that a\ntest or procedure is medical.” Id. It then provides a list of tests\nconsidered medical examinations, including “blood pressure\nscreening and cholesterol testing” and “range-of-motion tests\nthat measure muscle strength and motor function.” Id.\n\n   [4] The EEOC Enforcement Guidance states that certain\nemployer-required tests are generally not medical examina-\ntions, including\n\n    physical agility tests, which measure an employee’s\n    ability to perform actual or simulated job tasks, and\n    physical fitness tests, which measure an employee’s\n    performance of physical tasks, such as running or\n    lifting, as long as these tests do not include examina-\n    tions that could be considered medical (e.g., measur-\n    ing heart rate or blood pressure).\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n    1.   Single factors establish that the PCE was a medi-\n         cal examination\n\n   [5] In light of the agency guidance, Indergard’s argument\nthat the PCE was a medical examination is convincing. As\nnoted above, the PCE included range of motion and muscle\nstrength tests, and Starnes measured Indergard’s heart rate\nand recorded an observation about her breathing after the\ntreadmill test. Each of these tests is within the EEOC’s\ndescription of tests that are considered medical examinations.\nThe post-treadmill test heart rate measurement and notation\nregarding Indergard’s “increased oxygen” intake and demon-\nstration of “poor aerobic fitness” weigh heavily in favor of\nconsidering the PCE a medical exam, particularly because\nStarnes had already noted that Indergard “was able to walk for\n20 minutes at 2.8 mph on treadmill without increased antalgic\nbehavior or objective findings of pain complaints noted.” Had\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.          13895\nStarnes’s observations ended there, it might be appropriate to\ncharacterize the treadmill test as a test that measured Inder-\ngard’s performance of a physical task. Measuring Indergard’s\nheart rate and recording observations about her breathing and\naerobic fitness, however, was not only unnecessary to deter-\nmine whether she could perform the task, but is also the kind\nof examination that the EEOC Enforcement Guidance identi-\nfies as inappropriate to include in a non-medical physical agil-\nity or fitness test.\n\n   GP’s argument that anything less than a “genuine exercise\nstress test” is not a medical examination distorts the EEOC\nEnforcement Guidance and is not well-taken. Furthermore, to\nthe extent that GP attempts to rely on the magistrate judge’s\nconclusion that Indergard’s blood pressure and heart rate were\nmeasured as an “overall precaution before beginning testing\nrather than to measure [Indergard’s] physiological response to\nthe performance portion of the PCE,” we emphasize that her\nheart rate was taken both before and after the treadmill test,\nand we note that although it might be a prudent medical pro-\ncedure to take these physiological measurements, including\nthem in the report provided to GP was unnecessary for the\npurpose of determining whether Indergard was physically\ncapable of performing her job duties.\n\n    2.   Application of the seven-factor test establishes\n         that the PCE was a medical examination\n\n   [6] The EEOC Enforcement Guidance identifies seven fac-\ntors as relevant to determining whether a test is a medical\nexamination, and at least four weigh in Indergard’s favor.\nFirst, although Starnes is not a medical doctor, she is a\nlicensed occupational therapist. Nothing in the EEOC\nEnforcement Guidance indicates that the term “health care\nprofessional” should be limited to only doctors, and at least\none district court has found that the fact that a PCE “was\nadministered by a business specializing in physical therapy,\nand not a medical doctor, makes it no less ‘medical’ than a\n\f13896         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nnurse taking one’s blood pressure or an emergency medical\ntechnician administering care to a patient on the way to the\nhospital.” Medlin v. Rome Strip Steel Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570853\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570853/medlin-v-rome-strip-steel-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 294 (N.D.N.Y. 2003).\n\n   [7] Second, not only did Starnes administer the PCE, but\nshe interpreted Indergard’s performance and recommended\nthat she not return to work. Furthermore, Starnes submitted\nthe test results to Dr. Ketzler, Indergard’s treating orthopedic\nsurgeon, who indicated his agreement with Starnes’s recom-\nmendation. This distinguishes the PCE from a test where, for\nexample, a supervisor or other employee might observe the\nemployee’s physical ability to perform job tasks.\n\n   [8] Third, although the PCE was ostensibly intended to\ndetermine whether Indergard could return to work, the broad\nreach of the test was capable of revealing impairments of her\nphysical and mental health, particularly in light of Starnes\nrecording Indergard’s subjective reports of her current pain\nlevel, use of medication and assistive devices, and communi-\ncation, cognitive ability, attitude, and behavior.\n\n   [9] The fourth factor weighs in GP’s favor, as the PCE does\nnot seem to have been invasive. The fifth factor, however,\nbenefits Indergard because Starnes recorded her heart rate and\nbreathing pattern after the treadmill test, and Indergard’s mus-\ncle pain and stiffness after the first day of testing. These are\nmeasurements of Indergard’s physiological response to her\nperformance of a task and, as discussed above, go beyond col-\nlecting information necessary to determine whether Indergard\nwas physically capable of performing the task. We express no\nopinion on the sixth factor, except to note that the offices of\na licensed occupational therapist are more like a medical set-\nting than, for example, an employee’s work place.\n\n   [10] Finally, it is unclear whether the final factor favors\neither party, because the only evidence that medical equip-\nment was used in the PCE is Starnes’s use of a blood pressure\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.          13897\ncuff at the beginning of the PCE. Thus, viewed in the light\nmost favorable to Indergard, applying the balancing factors\nestablishes that the PCE was a medical examination.\n\n  B.   The limited case law available establishes that the\n       PCE was a medical examination\n\n   [11] Most cases interpreting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A)\naddress the question of whether an admitted medical examina-\ntion was job related and consistent with business necessity.\nSee, e.g., Yin v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726151\"><a href=\"/opinion/726151/cecelia-yin-v-state-of-california-daryll-tsujihara-linda-nicholson-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 868 (9th Cir. 1996)\n(following the district court in assuming that the proposed\nexamination was a medical examination within the meaning\nof 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A)).\n\n  The case most on point is Medlin, 294 F. Supp. 2d at\n293-94. Medlin, an employee, had been on medical leave after\na back injury. Id. at 284. Prior to returning to work, his\nemployer required him to undergo a functional capacity eval-\nuation (“FCE”) to determine whether his residual functional\ncapacity met the job requirements for the position he previ-\nously held. Id. at 285. The FCE results revealed that Medlin\nwas “unable to maintain safe work practices or a heart rate\nprofile required for the level of repetitions and duration for a\ncomplete Hot Role Slitter setup.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Medlin sued, alleging in part that the employer\nmade an improper disclosure of his medical information in\nviolation of the ADA when it made the results of the FCE\nknown to other employees. Id. at 293.\n\n   The court stated that the FCE was clearly job related and\nconsistent with business necessity, but noted that it was\nunclear whether it qualified as a medical examination. Id.\nWithout reaching a definitive conclusion, the court noted that\nEEOC guidance and case law had indicated “that testing\nordered by the employer that physically or mentally tests an\nemployee’s ability to perform his or her job are permissible\ntests under the ADA.” Id. at 293-94 (citing 29 C.F.R. Pt.\n\f13898         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\n1630, § 1630.13(b); Sullivan v. River Valley Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766895\"><a href=\"/opinion/766895/richard-a-sullivan-v-river-valley-school-district-and-charles-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (6th Cir. 1999)). The court then found that\nbecause the sole purpose of the FCE was to determine\nwhether Medlin “could physically return to work without any\nrestrictions” and was “in essence and in reality, a fitness for\nduty exam,” it therefore was likely a medical examination. Id.\nat 294.\n\n    GP argues that because the FCE in Medlin was adminis-\ntered to determine whether the employee could perform the\nphysical demands of his position without any restrictions, it\nwas designed to test the level of his disability and is therefore\ndistinguishable from the PCE in this case. This distinction is\nunpersuasive. Although the court did state that the purpose of\nthe FCE was to determine whether Medlin “could physically\nreturn to work without any restrictions,” id., it was adminis-\ntered to an injured employee returning from medical leave in\norder to ascertain whether he was capable of performing the\nphysical demands of his position. Id. at 284-86. Thus, there is\nlittle to distinguish the FCE at issue in Medlin from the PCE\nat issue here.\n\n   Furthermore, the Second Circuit has held that an employ-\ner’s policy that all employees returning from sick leave pro-\nvide a medical certification that included a “brief general\ndiagnosis that is ‘sufficiently informative as to allow [the\nDepartment of Correctional Services] to make a determination\nconcerning the employee’s entitlement to leave’ ” was “suffi-\ncient to trigger the protections of the ADA under [42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(d)(4)(A)]” because the general diagnosis “may tend\nto reveal a disability.” Conroy v. New York Dep’t of Corr.\nServ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782396\"><a href=\"/opinion/782396/deborah-conroy-and-blake-swingle-individually-and-on-behalf-of-all-others/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92, 95-96 (2d Cir. 2003). Although Con-\nroy was interpreting the provision in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(d)(4)(A) that prohibits an employer from making “in-\nquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an\nindividual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of\nthe disability” and is not directly on point, its reasoning is\nuseful to the extent that portions of Indergard’s PCE went\n\f                 INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.                  13899\nbeyond simply measuring her physical ability to perform job\ntasks and could have revealed a disability.\n\n   [12] The purpose of the PCE may very well have been to\ndetermine whether Indergard was capable of returning to\nwork. The substance of the PCE, however, clearly sought “in-\nformation about [Indergard’s] physical or mental impairments\nor health,” see EEOC Enforcement Guidance, and involved\ntests and inquiries capable of revealing to GP whether she suf-\nfered from a disability. Therefore, we hold that the PCE was\na medical examination under 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A).3\n  3\n   The dissent predicts a parade of lawsuit horribles for employers if\nIndergard’s PCE is held to be a medical examination within the meaning\nof 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). To reach this conclusion, the dissent disre-\ngards statutory language and commentary by dividing the comprehensive\nPCE into its component tests for analysis. In addition, the dissent would\nrequire Indergard to show that a particular component test was a medical\nexamination that proximately caused her to lose her job, a rationale that\nhas not been adopted in this circuit.\n   “The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by ref-\nerence to the language itself, the specific context in which that language\nis used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Robinson v.\nShell Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118082\"><a href=\"/opinion/118082/robinson-v-shell-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (1997). The statute provides that an\nemployer “shall not require a medical examination . . . unless such exami-\nnation . . . is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessi-\nty.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). The EEOC Enforcement Guidance for\n§ 12112(d)(4)(A) clarifies that testing blood pressure, cholesterol, muscle\nstrength, and motor function specifically are designated as medical exami-\nnations. “The whole purpose of placing a person on leave is that he or she\nmay eventually return to work.” Fredenburg, 172 F.3d at 1181.\n   “The ADA was enacted in 1992 ‘to provide a clear and comprehensive\nnational mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals\nwith disabilities.’ ” Yin, 95 F.3d at 867 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)).\nThe ADA provisions that prohibit using medical examinations to discrimi-\nnate in hiring or retaining employees protect all employees from being\nstigmatized by their disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d); see Fredenburg,\n172 F.3d at 1182 (“protecting only qualified individuals would defeat\nmuch of the usefulness of [the medical examination provisions]”). The\ndissent’s method of dividing Indergard’s PCE into component parts and\nengaging in proximate-cause analysis creates a risk that employers would\n\f13900            INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nII.   Exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\n   GP argues that Indergard failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies because her joint EEOC/BOLI complaint did not\nprovide requisite notice of the unlawful medical examination\nclaim. Indergard argues that the court should not reach this\nissue because she has alleged identical claims under Oregon’s\nstate disability law, which is substantively the same as federal\n\nseek to obtain medical information in tests that are not job-related and\nthereby escape liability by asserting that their employment decisions were\nbased on information revealed in non-medical components of the evalua-\ntion. This would promote unnecessary litigation, contravene the statutory\nprophylactic purpose, and deter disabled employees from returning to\nwork following medical leave, because of concern for being stigmatized\nby their disabilities.\n   Indergard was given a treadmill/blood-pressure test, which is used to\ndetect arterial blockages that could result in open-heart surgery. Unques-\ntionably, this is a medical examination, and taking blood pressure follow-\ning treadmill exertion is a critical part of the test not to be separated from\nit. Yet, the dissent segregates the blood-pressure test from this standard\nmedical procedure and re-characterizes it as incidental or a technical viola-\ntion of § 12112(d)(4)(A). While testing blood pressure is explicitly desig-\nnated in the statutory commentary as being a medical examination, the\ntherapist, who administered the PCE, took many physiological measure-\nments during the two-day testing, given as a composite examination.\nAvoiding the statutory language, commentary, and purpose, the dissent\nendeavors to convert the two-day PCE into a physical agility test, which\nemployers can give at any time, by dividing it into its component tests and\nanalyzing them separately.\n  Using this cut-and-divide approach, for which the dissent gives no\nauthority, not only dispenses with Indergard’s blood-pressure test as inci-\ndental but also focuses on her weight-lifting testing as the basis or proxi-\nmate cause for her termination. The therapist, who administered the PCE,\ndetermined that Indergard could not accomplish the 65-pound lift and\ncarry nor the 75-pound lift, respectively required for her former Consumer\nNapkin Operator position or the Napkin Adjuster position, for which she\nwould have been entitled to bid under the applicable collective bargaining\nagreement. Indergard’s doctor had deemed her able to return to work and\nsubsequently agreed with her termination, based solely on the weight lift-\ning purportedly required for the two jobs.\n\f                 INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.                  13901\nlaw but does not require administrative exhaustion, that GP\nwaived the failure to exhaust argument by way of a judicial\nadmission in its answer, that GP did not allege failure to\nexhaust as an affirmative defense, and that because the EEOC\nwould have addressed the medical examination in the scope\nof its investigation, the claim was properly before the district\ncourt.\n\n   Because the magistrate judge determined that the PCE was\nnot a medical examination, he declined to reach GP’s argu-\nment that Indergard failed to exhaust her administrative reme-\ndies with respect to this claim. In remanding this case, we do\nnot express any view on this argument, and the issue remains\nopen for the district court’s consideration.\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n   [13] We hold that the PCE was a medical examination\nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). Because\nthe magistrate judge correctly found that a triable issue of fact\nremained on the question of whether the PCE was job related\nand consistent with business necessity, the summary judgment\n\n   This circuit has not adopted a proximate-causation requirement in the\ncontext of § 12112(d)(4)(A).

An employee, who has\nworked for a company, has more invested in that employment, including\nbenefits, than an applicant for employment. Therefore, the employee has\nmore to lose by job termination than an applicant, and the employee also\neffectively has been penalized for a medical absence, when his or her job\nis lost upon return to work. Using its component-test analysis, the dissent\ninsists that Indergard has no cause of action, but she did lose her job when\nshe returned from medical leave because of the subject PCE. The dissent\ncannot inject into the plain statutory language a contrived proximate-cause\nrequirement. As GP notes, proximate cause “is not an issue the Court\nneeds to decide in this appeal” before initial determination by the district\ncourt and briefing on appeal. Appellee’s Br. at 22 n.5. Treating the two-\nday PCE as a whole, rather than analyzing its discrete tests, promotes the\ndeterrent purpose behind § 12112(d)(4)(A).\n\f13902            INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nwas inappropriate. We vacate the judgment and remand the\ncase to the district court to determine whether the PCE was\njob related and consistent with business necessity, and to\ndetermine whether Indergard exhausted administrative reme-\ndies.\n\n   VACATED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\nO’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n  The essential distinction between a medical examination\nand a physical fitness or agility test, for the purposes of the\n\n   Moreover, Indergard continues to argue on appeal that the 65-pound\nweight-lifting test for the Consumer Napkin Operator position, which was\nher job, and the 75-pound weight-lifting test for the Napkin Adjuster posi-\ntion are inaccurate weight requirements for these jobs. On summary judg-\nment review, Indergard’s statement of the weight requirements for the\nrespective jobs must be accepted. Cripe v. City of San Jose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774562\"><a href=\"/opinion/774562/rodger-m-cripe-brad-j-martin-james-p-okeefe-thomas-f-palmer-vince/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n895 (9th Cir. 2001). Because Indergard’s inability to lift these weights\nresulted in her termination, the weight-requirement discrepancy for the\ntwo positions is a genuine issue of material fact, which precludes summary\njudgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c); Cripe, 261 F.3d at 894-95. On remand,\nthe district court can make this factual determination in deciding whether\nIndergard’s medical examination was “job related and consistent with\nbusiness necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). GP has the burden of\nproving that the PCE weight lifting it required for the two positions satis-\nfies the business necessity defense, which “is quite high, and is not to be\nconfused with mere expediency.” Cripe, 261 F.3d at 890 (citation, internal\nquotation marks, and alteration omitted); see EEOC v. Prevo’s Family\nMarket, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751560\"><a href=\"/opinion/751560/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-prevos-family-market-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1091-92 & n.3 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that\nfamily-owned grocery store did not violate § 12112(d)(4)(A) in terminat-\ning produce clerk for failing to have a medical examination to determine\nif he was HIV-positive, when the job involved use of “paring knives, chef\nknives, cleavers and pineapple corers, all of which are shared by the\nclerks,” and the parties “agree[d] that produce clerks often cut themselves\nin the course of their regular duties”). The dissent’s upholding summary\njudgment for GP in this case defeats the statutory purpose of\n§ 12112(d)(4)(A) by creating a pretext by which employers could misuse\nmedical examinations to discriminate against disabled employees return-\ning to work from medical leave.\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.           13903\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), is that the former\nis designed to reveal disability, while the latter is designed to\ndetermine whether an employee can perform her job. I cannot\nconclude that the evaluation Kris Indergard underwent on her\nreturn to work at Georgia-Pacific was a medical examination\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A), for it was not designed to\nreveal disability. Furthermore, even assuming that there were\nany “medical” aspects of the physical capacity evaluation\n(“PCE”), they were merely incidental to the physical agility\naspects and did not in any way cause the harms that Indergard\nalleges. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n                                I\n\n   Indergard characterizes the PCE as “two days of testing,\npoking, palpating, and examining.” However, over the course\nof those two days, no blood was drawn, no urine samples col-\nlected, no labwork performed, and no x-rays or scans taken.\nNo doctor or nurse ever examined, diagnosed, or treated her.\nInstead, she went to an occupational therapy facility and per-\nformed various physical tasks designed to determine whether\nshe could safely perform the duties of her old job. Such test-\ning was unquestionably advisable given her own physician’s\npermanent restrictions on climbing, kneeling, squatting,\ncrawling, and lifting over thirty pounds. A common-sense\nreading of the term “medical examination” would not include\nthis PCE.\n\n   Unfortunately, common sense plays no role in our ADA\njurisprudence. Instead, the EEOC has muddied the jurispru-\ndential waters by issuing “guidances” that appear to read the\nword “medical” right out of the statute. For example, the\ninterpretive appendix to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.14(a) first states\nthat “[p]hysical agility tests are not medical examinations” but\nthen adds that “[i]f such tests screen out or tend to screen out\nindividuals with disabilities, the employer would have to\ndemonstrate that the test is job-related and consistent with\nbusiness necessity . . . .” Apparently, having a tendency to\n\f13904         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nscreen out disabled individuals automatically converts a phys-\nical agility test into a medical examination subject to the\nADA. Given that physical agility tests by their very nature\ntend to screen out people with certain disabilities, I see no\nway for employers to conduct such tests without inviting\nADA lawsuits from those who fail them.\n\n   In addition, an EEOC enforcement guidance defines a med-\nical examination as “a procedure or test that seeks information\nabout an individual’s physical or mental impairments or\nhealth.” EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Disability-Related\nInquiries and Medical Evaluations, available at\nhttp://eeoc.gov/policy/docs/guidance-inquiries.html [hereinaf-\nter Enforcement Guidance]. Under this broad definition, any\nreturn-to-work test would necessarily qualify as a medical\nexamination because it seeks to determine whether the\nemployee is fit enough to resume her duties. Employers seek-\ning to avoid ADA lawsuits would have to allow injured work-\ners to return to the job without being able to verify their\nfitness for duty, creating the potential for re-injury.\n\n   The Enforcement Guidance also declares physical agility\ntests not to be medical examinations “as long as these tests do\nnot include examinations that could be considered medical\n(e.g., measuring heart rate or blood pressure).” Hence, a sin-\ngle pulse measurement taken over the course of a two-day\nphysical agility test would be sufficient to convert such test\ninto a medical examination. If an employee taking a physical\nagility test shows obvious distress, the examiner would not be\nable to take her pulse or blood pressure as a precautionary\nmeasure without implicating the ADA. Employers seeking to\nensure returning workers’ safety must therefore navigate the\nprecarious straits between the Scylla of ADA liability and the\nCharybdis of a negligence lawsuit. Fearing either form of lia-\nbility, employers may very well decline to conduct any form\nof testing, thereby increasing the risk of returning worker\ninjury.\n\f              INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.         13905\n   The majority uncritically accepts these agency pronounce-\nments as gospel, even though we owe them no deference\nwhen they subvert the plain text of the statute. See Gen.\nDynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131162\"><a href=\"/opinion/131162/general-dynamics-land-systems-inc-v-cline/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600 (2004).\nI decline to read the statute in such a way as to render a term\nentirely meaningless.\n\n                              II\n\n   Turning to the PCE at issue in this case, I am not persuaded\nthat it can be considered a medical examination merely by vir-\ntue of the “single factors” that the majority lists: range-of-\nmotion and muscle strength tests, pulse measurement after a\ntreadmill test, and observations about Indergard’s breathing\nafter the treadmill test. It is important to remember that the\nPCE was a two-day examination comprising numerous tests.\nWhile one or two of these measurements may arguably have\nbeen medical in nature, these were at most de minimis com-\nponents that were incidental to the physical tasks that formed\nthe bulk of the PCE.\n\n   Furthermore, application of the seven-factor test also does\nnot convince me that the PCE as a whole was a medical\nexamination. In particular, I disagree with the majority’s con-\nclusions regarding factors three, five, and seven. Factor three\nasks “whether the test is designed to reveal an impairment in\nphysical or mental health.” Enforcement Guidance. According\nto the majority, “although the PCE was ostensibly intended to\ndetermine whether Indergard could return to work, the broad\nreach of the test was capable of revealing impairments of her\nphysical and mental health.” Maj. op. at 13896. Here the\nmajority appears to confuse intent with effect. Because the\nmajority believes that the PCE could reveal an impairment, it\nassumes that Georgia-Pacific intended for it to do so. I do not\nread factor three so broadly. With respect to factors five and\nseven, any measurement of physiological response and use of\nmedical equipment were de minimis in the overall context of\n\f13906           INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\nthe two-day PCE. On balance, the PCE looks overwhelmingly\nmore like a physical agility test than a medical examination.\n\n                                  III\n\n   In my view, the PCE cannot be considered a single exami-\nnation but rather a battery of individual tests. By its viewing\nof the PCE, the majority allows Indergard to proceed with her\nsuit even though she has shown no injury resulting from the\nallegedly medical tests. However, it was unquestionably the\nlifting task that scuttled Indergard’s return to work, not her\npulse rate after the treadmill test or her knee flexion. Because\nshe has suffered no injury from the parts of the test that alleg-\nedly were medical examinations, she cannot maintain a claim\nfor a violation of § 12112(d).\n\n   Our sister circuits have agreed that a plaintiff seeking relief\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d) must be able to show “something\nmore than a mere violation of that provision. There must be\nsome cognizable injury in fact of which the violation is a legal\nand proximate cause for damages to arise from a single viola-\ntion.” Armstrong v.

In other\nwords, “a technical violation” is not enough. Tice, 247 F.3d\nat 520. Here, even assuming that Georgia-Pacific technically\nviolated § 12112(d)(4)(A) by measuring Indergard’s pulse\nand range of motion, she has made no showing that such mea-\nsurements have proximately caused her to lose her job. There-\nfore, any such measurements “presents no ‘injury’ capable of\nremedy, and thus affords no basis for suit.” Id. at 519.\n\n  Armstrong is instructive because it presents a scenario anal-\nogous to this case, albeit in the context of preemployment\nmedical inquiries.1 Armstrong had applied for a position as a\n  1\n   Preemployment medical inquiries and examinations fall under 42\nU.S.C. § 12112(d)(2) of the ADA. Although the majority attempts to dis-\n\f                 INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.                  13907\npipefitter and was asked questions in his application about\nprior injuries, his medical history, and worker’s compensation\nclaims. The questionnaire also asked whether he had “any\ninjury or condition not mentioned on this form,” and Arm-\nstrong answered “no.” A background check later revealed that\nArmstrong had previously reported “possible asbestos expo-\nsure,” and he was “rejected due to the provision of incorrect\nand/or incomplete information.” 141 F.3d at 556-57. Because\nthe failure to hire had not resulted directly from the prohibited\nmedical inquiries, the court held that Armstrong lacked stand-\ning to sue for damages and injunctive relief under\n§ 12112(d)(2)(A). Id. at 562-63. The court noted that the\nADA was not intended to protect employees from adverse\nemployment actions “incident to a prohibited section\n12112(d)(2)(A) inquiry.” Id. at 560 n.15.\n\n   Similarly, Indergard’s termination was merely incident to\nan alleged technical violation of § 12112(d)(4)(A). Had\nGeorgia-Pacific administered only the treadmill exercise and\nrange-of-motion tests, she would not have a cause of action\nunder the ADA even assuming that they are medical examina-\ntions because she suffered no adverse employment action\nfrom these tests. Conversely, had Georgia-Pacific adminis-\ntered the lifting task alone, she also would not have a cause\nof action because the lifting task is not a medical examination.\nOnly by yoking these tests together and attributing an injury\nfrom a permissible physical agility task to an allegedly\nimproper medical examination can Indergard manufacture an\nADA violation.\n\ntinguish Armstrong on this basis, see Maj. op. at 13901 n.3, the same anal-\nysis applies to all of the medical inquiry and examination provisions under\n42 U.S.C. § 12112(d). See Tice, 247 F.3d at 519 (“Other courts of appeal\nhave addressed the question whether a plaintiff has a cause of action for\na violation of § 12112(d) without demonstrating the existence of an injury-\nin-fact . . . . All have concluded that a violation of § 12112(d), without a\nshowing, presents no ‘injury’ capable of remedy, and thus affords no basis\nfor suit.”).\n\f13908         INDERGARD v. GEORGIA-PACIFIC CORP.\n                              IV\n\n   Because the majority renders the term “medical” meaning-\nless and allows a plaintiff to continue her $250,000 suit on the\nbasis of a pulse measurement that caused her no harm, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
