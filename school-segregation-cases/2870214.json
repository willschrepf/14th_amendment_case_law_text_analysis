Norma Nesbit alleges that Gears\nUnlimited, Inc. (“Gears”) terminated her employment as a\nmachine operator because of her sex. She concedes that\nGears did not employ fifteen persons during the pertinent\ntime period, but argues that we should also count the\nemployees at a related entity, Winters Performance\nProducts (“Winters”). Together, Gears and Winters had\nmore than fifteen employees. We hold that the District\nCourt properly refused to aggregate the number of\nemployees at these companies. Because Title VII does not\ncover Gears by itself, we affirm the dismissal of Nesbit’s\ncomplaint. But we part with the District Court on the path\nto this result. It viewed Title VII’s “fifteen or more” person\nrequirement as jurisdictional. We affirm the dismissal of\nNesbit’s complaint on the merits rather than for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\n        I.   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  In 1973, Vaughn Winter, Sr. (“Vaughn Sr.”) founded\nWinters, which manufactures “rear ends” for high-\nperformance automobiles. In 1990, he acquired Gears, a\ntransmission parts manufacturer. Vaughn Sr. and his wife,\nMadeline Winter (“Madeline”), also formed Maverick\nIndustries, Inc. (“Maverick”), which warehouses automotive\nparts, including parts produced at Winters. At the time of\nthe events relating to this suit — December 1994 through\nAugust 1997 — Vaughn Sr. had a stake in three automotive\ncompanies: Gears, Winters, and Maverick.\n  The Winter family shares ownership and control of these\nthree companies. Vaughn Sr. owns ten percent of Gears,\nwith the remainder held in trust in equal shares for his\n\f                              3\n\n\nchildren — Nina and Vaughn Jr. Vaughn Sr. is president of\nGears and his children are corporate officers. He and\nMadeline own Winters and Maverick in equal shares. He is\npresident of Winters and Maverick, and Madeline is the\nSecretary/Treasurer at Winters.\n  Gears and Winters occupy separate plants about one\nmile apart in York, Pennsylvania. In almost all respects,\nthey operate independently. Their products are distinct —\nGears produces transmissions and Winters produces\nautomotive rear ends — and each company has its own\nequipment and production lines. Winters contracts to buy\nparts from Gears at market rates. The companies maintain\nseparate financial records and payrolls, write separate\nchecks, and file separate tax returns.\n  Vaughn Sr. monitors operations at both Gears and\nWinters. While he participates in day-to-day management\nat Winters, Gears is managed by Randy Lau. Vaughn Sr.\ntestified that he visits the Gears facility only about twice a\nmonth, usually because a machine has broken down.\nNesbit disputes this testimony, contending that Vaughn Sr.\nspends time at Gears “pretty much every day.”\n  The only area in which Gears and Winters cooperate\nconsiderably is in hiring. Typically, if either Gears or\nWinters has an opening, a Winters employee will place a\n“help wanted” sign on the street in front of the Winters\nbuilding. Prospective employees obtain applications at the\nWinters front office and return them there as well. If\nWinters is hiring, either Vaughn Sr. or his wife will invite\nqualified applicants for an interview. If Gears has an\nopening, someone at Winters will communicate with the\napplicant on Lau’s behalf and then direct him or her to the\nGears plant to interview with Lau. The hiring decision is\nthen Lau’s “prerogative.” However, Vaughn Sr. (who, as\nnoted above, normally does not participate in Gears\nmanagement) can request that Gears hire a particular\napplicant and Gears will generally do so. Either Lau or the\nWinter children normally decide whether to terminate an\nemployee, but Vaughn Sr. testified that he could ask Gears\nto fire an employee who engaged in significant misconduct.\n  On December 14, 1994, Nesbit submitted a standard\n\f                                4\n\n\nemployment application to Winters for a machine operator\nposition. That day, either Vaughn Sr. or Madeline\ninterviewed her.1 The interviewer concluded that no\navailable positions at Winters would be suitable for Nesbit\nand instead referred her to Gears, which hired her as a\nmachine operator.2 Vaughn Sr. personally accompanied\nNesbit to meet Lau, but the parties dispute whether\nVaughn Sr. or Lau actually made the hiring decision.\n   Nesbit remained at Gears for two years and eight months.\nShe perceived that Lau was her “boss” and was “more or\nless in charge” at Gears. Occasionally she also worked an\nextra shift at Winters following her regular shift at Gears.\nShe would punch out on the time clock at Gears and then\npunch in at Winters. When working a Winters shift, she\nreceived a separate paycheck. Her hours at the two plants\nwere not consolidated for overtime pay.\n  On August 19, 1997, Nesbit’s machine at Gears\n“crashed,” leaving it unusable without repairs. Nesbit\nbecame upset, which apparently caused her to develop a\nheadache and neck pains. She informed the acting\nsupervisor, Greg Pell, that she was leaving work to visit her\nchiropractor. When she returned the next day, Lau was on\nvacation,   and    Vaughn      Sr.   discharged    her    for\ninsubordination.\n   After receiving permission from the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, Nesbit filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania\nalleging that Gears discriminated against her because of\ngender. Gears moved to dismiss the complaint under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction on the basis that it employed fewer than\nfifteen persons during the relevant time period and\ntherefore was not an “employer” subject to Title VII.\n  Nesbit then filed an amended complaint alleging that\n\n1. The parties dispute whether Vaughn Sr. or Madeline conducted the\ninitial interview, though it is not important for our analysis.\n2. Nesbit is plaintiff ’s maiden name and the name she uses in this\nlitigation. The name on her employment application and in Gears’\nemployment records is Norma J. Tran.\n\f                                5\n\n\nGears and its “associate corporation” Winters Transmission,\nInc. — a company different from Winters that Vaughn Sr.\nowned from 1955 to 1985 — were really a single employer\nwith more than fifteen employees. Gears moved again for a\ndismissal, this time observing that the entity called\n“Winters Transmission, Inc.” had ceased operation long\nbefore Nesbit began working at Gears. Nesbit then filed a\nsecond amended complaint, alleging that Gears and\nWinters are associate corporations that together meet the\nfifteen-employee threshold. On the basis of that allegation,\nthe District Court ordered discovery limited to the question\nwhether Gears and Winters constitute a single employer\nunder Title VII. Following discovery, the District Court\nissued a memorandum and order in which it concluded\nthat Gears and Winters are separate entities and, because\nGears unquestionably employs fewer than fifteen persons\nby itself, dismissed Nesbit’s complaint for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction. This appeal followed.\n\n                     II.    DISCUSSION\nA.   Is the Number         of   Employees   a   Jurisdictional\n     Requirement?\n   We first address whether Title VII’s fifteen-employee\nthreshold is a jurisdictional prerequisite — as the District\nCourt believed it was in dismissing Nesbit’s complaint\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) — or whether it is a substantive\nelement of a Title VII claim. Whether an aspect of a claim\nconcerns subject matter jurisdiction or the merits has at\nleast three implications. First, because subject matter\njurisdiction is non-waivable, courts have an independent\nobligation to satisfy themselves of jurisdiction if it is in\ndoubt. See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,\n429 U.S. 274, 278 (1977). A necessary corollary is that the\ncourt can raise sua sponte subject-matter jurisdiction\nconcerns. Second, if the fifteen-employee requirement is not\njurisdictional, a Title VII claim for which the number of\nemployees is in doubt nonetheless will support\nsupplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 over state\nclaims. Da Silva v. Kinsho Int’l Corp., 229 F.3d 358, 362 &\n365 (2d Cir. 2000); 13B Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 3564, at 73-5 (2d ed. 1984). Third,\n\f                                   6\n\n\nin most contexts the question will be important to the\nplaintiff ’s burden of proof. If an aspect of a claim concerns\njurisdiction, and when jurisdiction turns on whether a\nparticular fact is true as here (as opposed to whether the\ncomplaint sufficiently alleges jurisdiction on its face), a\ncourt may inquire into the jurisdictional facts without\nviewing the evidence in a light favorable to either party. See\nMortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 549 F.2d 884,\n891 (3d Cir. 1977). By contrast, if an aspect of a claim\nconcerns the merits, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim a court must accept the\ncomplaint’s allegations as true, United States Express Lines\nLtd. v. Higgins, 281 F.3d 383, 388 (3d Cir. 2002); on a Rule\n56 motion for summary judgment it must view the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the non-moving party and, if\nthere are disputes over genuine issues of material fact, they\nare for the jury to resolve, Huang v. BP Amoco Corp., 271\nF.3d 560, 564 (3d Cir. 2001).\n  1.   Relevant Caselaw\n  The question whether Title VII’s fifteen-employee\nthreshold is a jurisdictional prerequisite when a plaintiff\nbrings a colorable Title VII claim has divided the courts of\nappeals.3 The Second and Seventh Circuits conclude that it\nis a substantive element that the plaintiff must prove\nunless the claim that there are fifteen employees is so\nobviously unfounded that it fails to raise a genuine federal\ncontroversy. Da Silva, 229 F.3d at 364-65 (2d Cir.);\n\n3. In Walters v. Metropolitan Educational Enterprises, Inc., 519 U.S. 202\n(1997), the Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide whether the\nSeventh Circuit erred in dismissing a Title VII suit for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction because the defendant company lacked fifteen\nemployees during the relevant period. The Court reversed and remanded,\nconcluding that the Seventh Circuit had erred in determining the\nnumber of employees, but did not address whether the fifteen-employee\nrequirement is jurisdictional or an element of the merits. Id. at 212.\n  Moreover, in Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69 (1984), the\nSupreme Court found it “unnecessary to consider the District Court’s\ninvocation of Rule 12(b)(1) [lack of subject matter jurisdiction], as\nopposed to Rule 12(b)(6) [failure to state a claim]” on a similar issue —\nwhether “Title VII [is applicable] to the selection of partners by a\npartnership.” Id. at 72-73 & n.2.\n\f                                    7\n\n\nJohnson v. Apna Ghar, Inc., 330 F.3d 999, 1001-02 (7th\nCir. 2003), petition for cert. filed, 72 U.S.L.W. 3021 (U.S.\nSept. 2, 2003) (No. 03-354); Papa v. Katy Indus., Inc., 166\nF.3d 937, 943 (7th Cir. 1999); Sharpe v. Jefferson Distrib.\nCo., 148 F.3d 676, 677-678 (7th Cir. 1998). Moreover, the\nD.C. Circuit has held the Americans with Disabilities Act’s\n(“ADA”) fifteen-employee threshold an element of the merits.\nEEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621,\n623-25 (D.C. Cir. 1997). In this context, the ADA’s fifteen-\nemployee requirement is in all relevant respects\nindistinguishable from Title VII’s.\n  By contrast, the Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh\nCircuits have said that the fifteen-employee threshold is\njurisdictional. Greenless v. Eidenmuller Enters., Inc., 32\nF.3d 197, 198 (5th Cir. 1994); Armbuster v. Quinn, 711\nF.2d 1332, 1335 (6th Cir. 1983); Childs v. Local 18, IBEW,\n719 F.2d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir. 1983); Owens v. Rush, 636\nF.2d 283, 287 (10th Cir. 1980);4 Scarfo v. Ginsberg, 175\nF.3d 957, 960 (11th Cir. 1999). Moreover, in Thurber v.\nJack Reilly’s, Inc., 717 F.2d 633 (1st Cir. 1983), the First\nCircuit upheld a district court’s dismissal of a Title VII case\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction (although the basis\nfor the District Court’s dismissal in Thurber — lack of\njurisdiction or the merits — was uncontested; at issue was\nthe number of employees the employer had). The Fourth\nCircuit also held that the number of employees is\njurisdictional in a case brought under the Family and\nMedical Leave Act (“FMLA”), a holding that suggests it\nwould deem the number of employees jurisdictional in the\nTitle VII context as well. See Hukill v. Auto Care, Inc., 192\nF.3d 437, 441 (4th Cir. 1999) (“A district court lacks\nsubject matter jurisdiction over an FMLA claim if the\ndefendant is not an employer as that term is defined in the\nFMLA [which defines an employer as “any person . . . who\nemploys 50 or more employees.]”).\n  The division is deeper than merely inter-circuit. Even\n\n4. Likewise, in Trainor v. Apollo Metal Specialties, 318 F.3d 976, 978 n.2\n(10th Cir. 2003), the Tenth Circuit held that whether an employer\nemploys fifteen people is a jurisdictional question in a case brought\nunder the ADA.\n\f                                     8\n\n\nwithin certain circuits that have held Title VII’s fifteen-\nemployee threshold jurisdictional, there is conflict. While in\nOwens the Tenth Circuit assumed (without analysis) that\nthe requirement is jurisdictional, in Wheeler v. Hurdman,\n825 F.2d 257 (10th Cir. 1987), that Court held that the\nfifteen-employee threshold is both jurisdictional and\n“intertwined with the merits of the case,” and therefore\nshould have been resolved as if on the merits. Id. at 259.\n   The Eleventh Circuit is similarly conflicted. In Garcia v.\nCopenhaver, Bell & Associates, M.D.’s, P.A., 104 F.3d 1256\n(11th Cir. 1997), the Court opined that the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act’s twenty-employee\nthreshold “goes to the merits of an ADEA case.” Id. at 1258.\nIt reasoned that “the section of the ADEA that provides the\nsubstantive relief ” — the section forbidding an employer\nfrom discriminating — “is intertwined and dependent on\nthe section of the ADEA that defines the scope of the act”\n— the section defining “employer” as one who employs more\nthan twenty employees. Id. at 1263. However, in a later\ncase, Scarfo, 175 F.3d 957, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed\na plaintiff ’s Title VII claim for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction when the defendant fell short of fifteen\nemployees. A third case, Morrison v. Amway Corp., 323\nF.3d 920 (11th Cir. 2003), recognized this intra-circuit\nconflict and essentially joined both camps. It stated that, in\nthe FMLA context, a fifty-employee threshold “implicate[s]\nboth jurisdiction and the underlying merits.” Id. at 929\n(emphasis added). However, it held that Garcia correctly\ndisposed of the issue as a matter of procedure: “the district\ncourt was required to find that jurisdiction exists and deal\nwith the objection as a direct attack on the merits of\nplaintiff ’s case” because of the degree to which the\njurisdictional and merits inquiries were intertwined. Id. at\n929-30 (internal quotation marks omitted).5\n\n5. Moreover, all the circuits that have held the fifteen-employee threshold\njurisdictional have also stated — in the same case or in other cases —\nthat “where the jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the facts central\nto the merits of the dispute[,] [i]t is the better view that . . . the entire\nfactual dispute is appropriately resolved only by a proceeding on the\nmerits.” Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982); see Clark\nv. Tarrant County, Texas, 798 F.2d 736, 741-42 (5th Cir. 1986); Gould,\n\f                                  9\n\n\n  2.   Title VII’s Fifteen-Employee Requirement is an Element\n       of the Merits\n   With this conflict in mind, we begin our determination by\nnoting that subject matter jurisdiction is the “courts’\nstatutory or constitutional power to adjudicate” particular\ncases. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83,\n89 (1998) (emphasis in original). Steel Co. requires that\ncourts normally should not conflate subject matter\njurisdiction with elements of an action’s merits. The\nSupreme Court held that the elements of another federal\nstatute — the Emergency Planning and Community Right-\nTo-Know Act of 1986 (“EPCRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 11046(a)(1) —\nare not jurisdictional prerequisites. Steel Co., 523 U.S. at\n90-93. In relevant part, EPCRA requires users of specified\nhazardous chemicals to file annual reports detailing their\nchemical inventories, waste-disposal methods, and recent\nreleases of chemicals from their facilities into the\nenvironment, and provides that the “district courts shall\nhave jurisdiction in actions brought under subsection (a) of\nthis section against an owner or operator of a facility to\nenforce the requirement concerned and to impose any civil\npenalty provided for violation of that requirement.” 42\nU.S.C. § 11046(c). The Steel Co. plaintiff, a group to protect\nenvironmental rights, sued a Chicago manufacturer and\nasserted past violations of EPCRA. After being notified that\nit was in arrears on its filings, the manufacturer filed all\nthe overdue reports. The plaintiff nonetheless continued its\nsuit, seeking relief for past reporting violations.\n  The District Court concluded that EPCRA does not\nsupport suits for past violations and therefore dismissed\nthe plaintiff ’s complaint under both Rules 12(b)(1) and\n12(b)(6). The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nreversed, holding that EPCRA permits such suits. The\nSupreme Court determined that the case raised (1) whether\n\nInc. v. Pechiney Ugine Kuhlmann, 853 F.2d 445, 451 (6th Cir. 1988);\nTimberlane v. Bank of Am., 749 F.2d 1378, 1381 (9th Cir. 1984),\noverruled on other grounds by Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509\nU.S. 764 (1993); Wheeler v. Hurdman, 825 F.2d at 259; Morrison v.\nAmway Corp., 323 F.3d at 929. These cases highlight the unsettled\nnature of the merits/jurisdictional question.\n\f                               10\n\n\nthe plaintiff had constitutional standing and (2) whether\nallegations of past violations state a cause of action under\nEPCRA, Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 88. As to the latter, the Court\ndecided that the past violations question was on the merits\nand not a jurisdictional requirement. Id. at 110. In so\ndoing, Steel Co. rejected attempts to portray the\nrequirement to prove all elements of a cause of action as\nrelevant to federal courts’ jurisdiction to hear a suit. The\nCourt reasoned that “[i]t is firmly established in our cases\nthat absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of\naction does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction.” Id. at\n89. On the contrary,\n    ‘[j]urisdiction . . . is not defeated . . . by the possibility\n    that the averments might fail to state a cause of action\n    on which petitioners could actually recover.’ Rather,\n    the district court has jurisdiction if ‘the right of the\n    petitioners to recover under their complaint will be\n    sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United\n    States are given one construction and will be defeated\n    if they are given another . . . .’\nId. at 89 (quoting Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 685 (1946)).\n   The Court also criticized the implications of treating the\nvalidity of a cause of action as jurisdictional. Id. at 92-93.\nUnder that approach, each element of every cause of action\nwould have a legitimate claim to being a jurisdictional\nrequirement — essentially eviscerating the distinction\nbetween the jurisdictional and merits inquiry (and requiring\na court to dismiss a claim for lack of jurisdiction whenever\nthe plaintiff does not prevail). The Court made plain,\nhowever, that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking if the\nalleged basis for jurisdiction “clearly appears to be\nimmaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining\njurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial\nor frivolous.” Id. at 89.\n  We presaged Steel Co. in a case decided five years earlier.\nIn Growth Horizons, Inc. v. Delaware County, 983 F.2d\n1277, 1280-81 (3d Cir. 1993), the District Court dismissed\na claim under the Fair Housing Act for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction. The Fair Housing Act makes it\nunlawful, inter alia, “[t]o discriminate in the sale or rental,\n\f                                    11\n\n\nor to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any\nbuyer or renter because of a handicap.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(f)(1). The District Court concluded that the\ndefendant did not “make unavailable or deny” housing to\nthe plaintiff and that the Fair Housing Act was therefore\nnot implicated. We reversed, holding that “[a] district court\nhas federal question jurisdiction in any case where a\nplaintiff with standing makes a non-frivolous allegation that\nhe or she is entitled to relief because the defendant’s\nconduct violated a federal statute.” Growth Horizons, 983\nF.2d at 1281. We further explained that “[d]ismissal for lack\nof jurisdiction is not appropriate merely because the legal\ntheory alleged is probably false, but only because the right\nclaimed is ‘so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior\ndecisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of\nmerit as not to involve a federal controversy.’ ” Id. at 1280-\n81 (citing Kulick v. Pocono Downs Racing Ass’n, 816 F.2d\n895, 899 (3d Cir. 1987) (quoting Oneida Indian Nation v.\nCounty of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 666 (1974))); see also 2\nMoore’s Federal Practice § 12.30[1], at 12-36 (3d ed. 2000)\n(“Subject matter jurisdiction in federal-question cases is\nsometimes erroneously conflated with a plaintiff ’s need and\nability to prove the defendant bound by the federal law\nasserted as a predicate for relief — a merits-related\ndetermination.”).6\n\n6. The Restatement (Second) of Judgments: Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n§ 11 (1982) also addresses the question whether an issue affects subject\nmatter jurisdiction or the merits, ultimately concluding that there is no\nprincipled way to distinguish between the two. It notes that “[t]here is a\nstrong tendency in procedural law to treat various kinds of serious\nprocedural errors as defects in subject matter jurisdiction . . . because\ncharacterizing a court’s departure in exercising authority as\n‘jurisdictional’ permits an objection to the departure to be taken\nbelatedly.” Restatement (Second) of Judgments: Subject Matter\nJurisdiction § 11 cmt. e. Relevant to the question here, it goes on to note\nthat\n    [t]he difficult problems are encountered when the issues on which\n    the court’s subject matter jurisdiction depends are not so clearcut.\n    [For example,] if the court has jurisdiction of actions of more than\n    a specified amount, there can be uncertainty in whether a particular\n    claim exceeds that amount. The problem can be particularly difficult\n\f                                   12\n\n\n   Turning to Title VII, we note that those courts that have\nheld the fifteen-employee requirement jurisdictional have\nprovided no reasons for their holding; rather, they have\nassumed it so or stated the conclusion without meaningful\nanalysis. Moreover, in reading 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b) we\nperceive no congressional intent to make the requirement\njurisdictional. Indeed, Title VII contains an explicit\njurisdictional section, § 2000e-5(f)(3), which provides that\n“[e]ach United States district court and each United States\ncourt of a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United\nStates shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this\nsubchapter.” By contrast, § 2000e(b) — in which the fifteen-\nemployee requirement appears — is a definitional section,\ndefining “employer.” We doubt that Congress intended this\ndefinitional section to have subject matter jurisdictional\nimport. If Congress had so intended, we believe its intention\nwould be clearer. Notably, § 2000e(b) does not even contain\nthe word “jurisdiction.” Compare 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (“The\ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil\nactions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of\nthe United States.”); id. § 1332 (explicitly making diverse\ncitizenship    and    a    $75,000     amount-in-controversy\njurisdictional prerequisites). Moreover, congressional debate\n(albeit postdating the requirement that an “employer” have\nmore than fifteen employees) reveals that at least some\nlegislators regard the fifteen-employee minimum not as\njurisdictional but as an element of the cause of action. See\n137 Cong. Rec. H9505-01 (Daily ed. Nov. 7, 1991)\n(statement of Rep. Brooks) (“[W]hen a company has less\nthan 15 employees, there are no damages available\nwhatsoever because there is no cause of action under our\ncurrent antidiscrimination statutes.”).\n\n\n\n\n    when the issue determining subject matter jurisdiction parallels an\n    issue going to the merits.\nId. In those cases the Restatement concludes that “the matter in\nquestion can plausibly be characterized either as going to subject matter\njurisdiction or as being one of merits or procedure.” Id.\n\f                               13\n\n\n  3.     Most Plausible Arguments for Making             Fifteen-\n         Employee Requirement Jurisdictional\n\n    a.    Commerce Clause Argument\n   Perhaps the most plausible reason for finding that the\nfifteen-employee requirement is jurisdictional is that it\nconcerns a “dispute[ ] as to the existence of a fact that is\nessential to a constitutional exercise of Congress’s power to\nregulate.” Da Silva, 229 F.3d at 363 (suggesting this as a\nsituation “[l]ess clearly placed on one side of the\njurisdiction/merits line”). As discussed, Title VII applies to\n“employers” and defines an “employer” (in relevant part) as\n“a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who\nhas fifteen or more employees.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).\nBecause Congress enacted Title VII under its Commerce\nClause power, EEOC v. Ratliff, 906 F.2d 1314, 1315-16 (9th\nCir. 1990), the requirement that an employer be “in an\nindustry affecting commerce” is the statute’s constitutional\nbasis. And because the requirements that the employer be\n“in an industry affecting commerce” and that the employer\nhave “fifteen or more employees” appear side by side in the\nstatute, it is arguably reasonable to read § 2000e(b)’s\n“fifteen employee” minimum as relevant to Title VII’s\nCommerce Clause basis as well. That is, one might read the\nfifteen-employee        threshold   as    reflecting  Congress’s\ndetermination that only those companies with fifteen or\nmore employees have the requisite substantial effect on\ninterstate commerce to permit Congress to enact the\nstatute. See Legislative History of Titles VII and XI of Civil\nRights Act of 1964, at 2108 (1964) (“The bill proceeds upon\na theory . . . that the quantum of employees is a rational\nyardstick by which the interstate commerce concept can be\nmeasured.”) (separate minority views of Reps. Poff and\nCramer, Members, House Comm. on the Judiciary); cf.\nWillis v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 948 F.2d 305, 311 (6th\nCir. 1991) (noting “Congress’s determination in Title VII\nthat any employer with 15 or more employees necessarily\nimplicates interstate commerce”); Ratliff, 906 F.2d at 1317\n(“[I]t is difficult to imagine any activity, business or industry\nemploying 15 or more employees that would not in some\ndegree affect commerce among the states.”) (quoting A.\n\f                             14\n\n\nLarson & L.K. Larson, Employment Discrimination § 5.31, at\n2-40 (1987)).\n   This argument, while well-made, nonetheless is\nunconvincing. First, the very wording of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e(b) suggests that the requirements that an employer\nbe “in an industry affecting commerce” and have “fifteen or\nmore employees” are separate and independent, and that it\nis a mistake to conflate the two. Even if a putative employer\nhas twenty employees, it is not covered by Title VII if not in\nan industry affecting commerce. Second, while the\npreceding Commerce Clause-based justification for Title\nVII’s fifteen-employee requirement makes intuitive sense, it\nfinds little support in the legislative history. We note that\nthe 1972 amendments to Title VII lowered the minimum\nnumber of employees from twenty-five to fifteen. Patricia\nDavidson, Comment, The Definition of “Employee” Under\nTitle    VII:  Distinguishing    Between     Employees    and\nIndependent Contractors, 53 U. Cin. L. Rev. 203, 206 (1984)\n(noting this change). It lacks logic that, pre-1972, Congress\nbelieved that it took twenty-five employees for a substantial\neffect on interstate commerce but changed its mind in\n1972. Furthermore, as initially proposed, the 1972\namendment to Title VII contained an eight-employee\nthreshold. See Armbruster, 711 F.2d at 1337 n.4. The\nthreshold was ultimately raised to fifteen employees as the\nresult of a political compromise, see id., in order (among\nother reasons) “to protect ethnic businesses and small\nbusinesses.” Davidson, supra, at 206 & n.23. Thus, the\nfifteen-employee threshold appears motivated by policy —\nto spare small companies the expense of complying with\nTitle VII — rather than Commerce Clause considerations.\n  Even assuming that Congress lacks authority to enact a\nstatute does not mean that a federal court lacks\njurisdiction to review actions brought under that statute.\nWhen disposing of a claim brought under an\nunconstitutional statute, courts ordinarily deny the claim\non the merits, on the ground that the statute under which\nrelief is sought is unconstitutional, rather than for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Martin v. United Way of Erie\nCounty, 829 F.2d 445, 447 (3d Cir. 1987); Kulick v. Pocono\nDowns Racing Ass’n, Inc., 816 F.2d 895 (3d Cir. 1987)\n\f                              15\n\n\n(noting the difference between congressional jurisdiction\nand federal courts’ Article III jurisdiction, and concluding\nthat “[e]lements of a claim that are called jurisdictional\nbecause they relate to Congress’s jurisdiction remain\nquestions of the merits”); see also Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm,\nInc., 789 F. Supp. 231 (E.D. Ky. 1992), aff ’d, 1 F.3d 1487\n(6th Cir. 1993), aff ’d, 514 U.S. 211 (1995).\n\n    b.   Jurisdictional Statements in Other Supreme Court\n         Cases\n  EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244 (1991),\ncan be read to suggest that the fifteen-employee\nrequirement is jurisdictional. In that case, the Supreme\nCourt decided whether Title VII “applies extraterritorially to\nregulate the employment practices of United States\nemployers who employ United States citizens abroad.” Id. at\n246. The Court addressed the question not as whether Title\nVII granted plaintiffs a cause of action for extraterritorial\nviolations, but rather whether Title VII granted\nextraterritorial jurisdiction, see id. at 250, and affirmed the\ndismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Id. at\n259. In Arabian American Oil Co., however, a policy\nconsideration       —     namely,    the    significant   effect\nextraterritorial application of U.S. law might have on\ninternational      relations    —     favored    viewing     the\nextraterritoriality question as one of jurisdiction. That is,\neven if parties did not raise the question of Title VII’s\nextraterritorial application, Congress would likely have\nintended courts to raise the issue sua sponte in the interest\nof harmonious international relations. Such concerns of\ninternational comity are not present here.\n  By analogy, some may find EEOC v. Commercial Office\nProducts Co., 486 U.S. 107 (1988), to counsel for finding\njurisdictional the fifteen-employee requirement. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court stated that “Title VII does not give\nthe EEOC jurisdiction to enforce the Act against employers\nof fewer that 15 employees.” Id. at 119 n.5. But this does\nnot address the question before us. Title VII grants the\nEEOC power “to prevent any person from engaging in any\nunlawful employment practice.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(a).\nThus, if an entity (a “person” under the statute) employs\n\f                              16\n\n\nfewer than fifteen employees, by § 2000e-5(a)’s terms, the\nEEOC lacks power (jurisdiction). By contrast, Title VII’s\njurisdictional grant to the federal courts is broader. See id.\n§ 2000e-5(f)(3) (“Each United States district court and each\nUnited States court of a place subject to the jurisdiction of\nthe United States shall have jurisdiction of actions brought\nunder this subchapter.”).\n  4.   Judicial Administration Reasons for Fifteen-Employee\n       Requirement Being an Element of a Title VII Claim\n       rather than a Jurisdictional Requirement\n   As a policy matter — which is ultimately the gut of our\ninquiry — it also makes little sense to regard the fifteen-\nemployee threshold as jurisdictional. Such a holding would\nrequire a federal court to determine whether a company\nhad fifteen employees during the relevant period, even if the\nparties so stipulated. To require a federal court to engage in\nsuch a fact-intensive inquiry sua sponte — which might in\nsome cases require a federal appellate court to dig through\nan extensive record, including pay stubs and time sheets —\nappears to be a waste of scarce judicial resources, and we\ndoubt that Congress intended such a result. See Da Silva,\n229 F.3d at 365 (“[I]nstitutional requirements of a judicial\nsystem weigh in favor of narrowing the number of facts or\ncircumstances that determine subject matter jurisdiction.”);\nSharpe, 148 F.3d at 678 (“Surely the number of employees\nis not the sort of question a court (including appellate\ncourt) must raise on its own . . . .”).\n  To hold the requirement jurisdictional also implies that a\ncourt would need to decide whether an entity employed\nmore than fifteen individuals before reaching a Title VII\naction’s merits — even if the merits were more easily\nresolved than the “jurisdictional” question. Steel Co., 523\nU.S. at 94-95. This result too is undesirable.\n                       * * * * * * * * *\n   In this context, we hold that, while the matter is not free\nfrom doubt, the fifteen-employee threshold is a substantive\nelement (whether an “employer” exists) of a Title VII claim\nand is not jurisdictional. Federal jurisdiction is implicated\nonly when the Title VII claim “clearly appears to be\nimmaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining\n\f                               17\n\n\njurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial\nor frivolous,” Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 89, neither of which is\nthe case here.\nB.        Should We Consolidate the Number of Employees at\n          Gears and Winters?\n  As the District Court looked beyond Nesbit’s complaint\nand reviewed discovery on whether Gears employs more\nthan fifteen people, it should have resolved the issue under\nthe summary judgment standard rather than as a motion\nfor judgment on the pleadings. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).\nNonetheless, we may affirm its disposition for any reason\nsupported by the record. Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp.,\n293 F.3d 103, 109 (3d Cir. 2002). Though the District\nCourt analyzed this case as jurisdictional rather than on\nthe merits, Nesbit fails nonetheless. Gears and Winters are\nplainly separate entities that cannot be consolidated to\nmeet the fifteen-employee threshold.\n     1.    The National Labor Relations Board’s “Integrated\n           Enterprise” Test\n   Several courts of appeals have borrowed a four-part test\n— commonly called the “integrated enterprise” test or the\n“single employer” test — from the National Labor Relations\nBoard (“NLRB”) to determine when two nominally distinct\ncompanies should be treated as a single entity under Title\nVII. See Anderson v. Pacific Maritime Association, 336 F.3d\n924, 929 (9th Cir. 2003); RC Aluminum Industries, Inc. v.\nNational Labor Relations Board, 326 F.3d 235, 239 (D.C.\nCir. 2003); Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d\n326, 341 (2d Cir. 2000); Artis v. Francis Howell North Band\nBooster Ass’n, Inc., 161 F.3d 1178, 1184 (8th Cir. 1998);\nFrank v. U.S. West, Inc., 3 F.3d 1357, 1362 (10th Cir.\n1993); McKenzie, 834 F.2d at 933; Childs, 719 F.2d at\n1382-83; Armbruster, 711 F.2d at 1336-38; Trevino v.\nCelanese Corp., 701 F.2d 397, 403-04 (5th Cir. 1983). The\nfour factors of the NLRB test are “(1) interrelation of\noperations, (2) common management, (3) centralized control\nof labor relations, and (4) common ownership or financial\ncontrol.” Artis, 161 F.3d at 1184 (citation omitted); see also\nNLRB v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Pa., 691 F.2d. 1117,\n1122 (3d Cir. 1982) (discussing the test in the labor\n\f                             18\n\n\ncontext). Among these factors, “[n]o single factor is\ndispositive; rather, single employer status under this test\n‘ultimately depends on all the circumstances of the case.’ ”\nPearson v. Component Tech. Corp., 247 F.3d 471, 486 (3d\nCir. 2001) (describing but not adopting the test in a case\napplying the Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act)\n(citation omitted). “[T]he heart of the inquiry is whether\nthere is an absence of an arm’s-length relationship among\nthe companies.” Knowlton v. Teltrust Phones, Inc., 189 F.3d\n1177, 1184 (10th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted); Browning-\nFerris, 691 F.2d at 1122. Moreover, “[c]ourts applying this\nfour-part standard in Title VII and related cases have\nfocused on the second factor: centralized control of labor\nrelations.” Trevino, 701 F.2d at 404.\n   The Seventh Circuit has rejected the NLRB’s four-factor\ntest as unhelpful in the anti-discrimination context. Papa v.\nKaty Indus., Inc., 166 F.3d 937, 942-43 (7th Cir. 1999). In\naddition, other courts have occasionally listed, but\nessentially ignored, the NLRB factors in Title VII cases,\nfocusing instead on which entity actually made the\nallegedly discriminatory employment decision. See, e.g.,\nLusk v. Foxmeyer Health Corp., 129 F.3d 773, 777 (5th Cir.\n1997); see also Marc Crandley, Note, The Failure of the\nIntegrated Enterprise Test: Why Courts Need to Find New\nAnswers to the Multiple-Employer Puzzle in Federal\nDiscrimination Cases, 75 Ind. L.J. 1041, 1059-71 (2000)\n(arguing against application of the NLRB test in the Title VII\ncontext and presenting alternative options).\n  As the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) and Title VII\naddress aspects of employer-employee relations, there is\nsurface appeal to applying the NLRB’s test in the Title VII\ncontext. But given the different policies animating the two\nstatutes, the NLRB test does not self-steer to the Title VII\ncontext. That test is designed to determine whether the\nNLRB may decide a particular labor dispute. UA Local 343\nUnited Ass’n of Journeymen & Apprentices of Plumbing &\nPipefitting Indus. of U.S. & Canada, AFL-CIO v. Nor-Cal\nPlumbing, Inc. 48 F.3d 1465, 1470 (9th Cir. 1994) (“[I]f the\nNLRB finds that [two firms] constitute a single unit . . . the\ncollective bargaining agreement with the union firm [may]\nbe extended to the non-union firm.”); Crandley, supra, at\n\f                                  19\n\n\n1064-65; see also Murray v. Miner, 74 F.3d 402, 404 (2d\nCir. 1996) (describing the test’s purpose to be “to protect\nthe collective bargaining rights of employees and to advance\nindustrial stability”). If the company at issue satisfies the\nNLRB test, it will in many cases be required to submit to\ncollective bargaining. Crandley, supra, at 1064. But if a\ndefendant in a Title VII suit is deemed an “employer” within\nthe meaning of the statute, it may be subject to liability.\n   Because the NLRA and Title VII ask whether entities are\na single enterprise for different reasons, it does not follow\nthat the NLRB’s test is any more relevant to Title VII cases\nthan any of the other tests for determining whether two\ncompanies should be regarded as one. To the contrary, for\npurposes of determining whether two companies are a\nsingle employer, the NLRA’s policy goals point in a different\ndirection than Title VII’s. As discussed, a significant\npurpose of the fifteen-employee minimum in the Title VII\ncontext is to spare small companies the considerable\nexpense of complying with the statute’s many-nuanced\nrequirements. See Papa, 166 F.3d at 940; Armbruster, 711\nF.2d at 1337 n.4 (reviewing the legislative history behind\nthe fifteen-employee minimum). This goal suggests that the\nfifteen-employee minimum should be strictly construed. By\ncontrast, the NLRB’s jurisdiction was intended to be\nexpansive, suggesting a more lenient test for labor cases.\nSee Crandley, supra, at 1065-66. Thus we deem there is\nlittle reason to refer to the NLRB’s test in deciding whether\ntwo entities should together be considered an “employer”\nfor Title VII purposes. We instead adopt a different\nframework, tailored to Title VII’s policy goals.\n  2.   Our Framework\n   In Papa, the Seventh Circuit developed its own test to\ndetermine whether two nominally distinct entities should be\nconsidered as one for Title VII purposes. The Court began\nwith the “basic principle of affiliate liability[,] . . . that an\naffiliate forfeits its limited liability only if it acts to forfeit it.”\nId. at 941 (emphasis in original). It proceeded to find three\nsituations in the Title VII context when a company and its\naffiliates forfeit limited liability and thus are deemed a\nsingle employer: (1) where a company has split itself into\nentities with less than fifteen employees with the intent to\n\f                              20\n\n\nevade Title VII’s reach; (2) when a parent company has\ndirected the subsidiary’s discriminatory act of which the\nplaintiff is complaining; or (3) when a court would\notherwise pierce the corporate veil (i.e., look behind the\ncorporate form to hold a corporation’s shareholders\npersonally liable). Id. at 940-41.\n   We too will consider a company and its affiliates a single\nemployer under Title VII (1) when a company has split itself\ninto entities with less than fifteen employees intending to\nevade Title VII’s reach or (2) when a parent company has\ndirected the subsidiary’s discriminatory act of which the\nplaintiff is complaining. However, on the third part of this\ndisjunctive test, we articulate a slightly different standard\nfrom the Seventh Circuit. Rather than applying the test for\nveil piercing imported from the corporation law context\n(because individual shareholder liability is not implicated\nhere), we will apply the factors courts use to determine\nwhen substantively to consolidate two or more entities in\nthe bankruptcy context. When courts substantively\nconsolidate two entities, they treat the assets and liabilities\nof each as belonging to a single entity. We explain in\nfurther detail each test.\n\n    a.   Splitting a Single Company into Two or More to\n         Evade Title VII\n  When a plaintiff proves that a company has split itself\ninto multiple entities to evade coverage under Title VII, we\nconsider those entities a single company for purposes of\nmeeting the fifteen-employee threshold. “The privilege of\nseparate incorporation is not intended to allow enterprises\nto duck their statutory duties.” Id. at 941.\n  A plaintiff need not prove that evading Title VII was the\nonly reason that a business split itself into multiple\nentities. Rather, it must make a prima facie case that this\nwas a substantial motivating factor, after which the burden\nwill shift to the defendant to produce evidence rebutting the\nplaintiff ’s proof. Relevant to a prima facie case are\nconsiderations such as (1) lack of a reasonable business\njustification, (2) whether the business split was one that, as\nan operational matter, would more sensibly be contained\n\f                                   21\n\n\nwithin a single business entity (e.g., the two companies\nmake the same product or inputs for the same product),\nand (3) statements from those familiar with the industry\nsuggesting that the company was split into multiple entities\nto evade Title VII.\n\n    b.   Parent Directing Subsidiary’s Act\n   When the companies sought to be aggregated for Title VII\npurposes are in a parent-subsidiary relationship, we shall\ndeem a parent and subsidiary a single employer when the\nparent has directed the subsidiary to perform the allegedly\ndiscriminatory act in question. By directing such an act,\nthe parent disregards the separate corporate existence of\nthe subsidiary and thus forfeits the right to be treated as a\nseparate entity for Title VII purposes. Moreover, in such a\nsituation the parent itself has committed the act in\nquestion and thus should share responsibility with the\nsubsidiary. See Papa, 166 F.3d at 941.\n\n    c.   Substantive Consolidation\n   Absent either of the first two situations, we shall look to\nthe factors courts use in deciding whether substantively to\nconsolidate two or more entities in the bankruptcy context.\nWhile these factors vary from circuit to circuit, the test at\nbase seeks to determine whether two or more entities’\naffairs are so interconnected that they collectively caused\nthe alleged discriminatory employment practice. More\ncolloquially, the question is whether the “eggs” — consisting\nof the ostensibly separate companies — are so scrambled\nthat we decline to unscramble them. We note, however,\nthat substantive consolidation is an equitable remedy and\nis difficult to achieve.7\n\n7. In addressing whether substantively to consolidate two entities in the\nbankruptcy context, courts have developed a number of different tests.\nSome have applied a seven-factor test, first set forth in In re Vecco\nConstruction Industries, Inc., 4 B.R. 407 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1980). Those\nfactors are: “(1) The presence or absence of consolidated financial\nstatements; (2) The unity of interests and ownership between various\ncorporate entities; (3) The existence of parent and intercorporate\nguarantees on loans; (4) The degree of difficulty in segregating and\n\f                                     22\n\n\n We adopt an intentionally open-ended, equitable inquiry\n— which we consider one of federal common law — to\n\nascertaining individual assets and liabilities; (5) The existence of\ntransfers of assets without formal observance of corporate formalities; (6)\nThe commingling of assets and business functions; [and] (7) The\nprofitability of consolidation at a single physical location.” Id. at 410; see\nalso In re Mortgage Inv. Co., 111 B.R. 604, 610 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1990);\nHolywell Corp. v. Bank of N.Y., 59 B.R. 340, 347 (S.D. Fla. 1986); In re\nDonut Queen, Ltd., 41 B.R. 706, 709 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1984) (all applying\nthe Vecco seven-factor test).\n  The First Circuit, in Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. v. Ouimet Corp.,\n711 F.2d 1085 (1st Cir. 1983), posed five nonexclusive factors a court\nshould consider when contemplating substantive consolidation: whether\n(1) the parent owns a majority of the subsidiary’s stock; (2) the entities\nhave common officers or directors; (3) the subsidiary is grossly\nundercapitalized; (4) the subsidiary transacts business solely with the\nparent; and (5) both entities disregard the legal requirements of the\nsubsidiary as a separate corporation. Id. at 1093.\n  In In re Augie/Restivo Baking Co., 860 F.2d 515 (2d Cir. 1988), the\nSecond Circuit surveyed the caselaw and extracted two fundamental\nprinciples guiding the substantive consolidation inquiry: (1) “whether\ncreditors dealt with the entities as a single economic unit and did not\nrely on their separate identity in extending credit” and (2) “whether the\naffairs [of the two companies] are so entangled” that consolidation will be\nbeneficial. Id. at 518 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth\nCircuit has also adopted this test. See In re Bonham, 229 F.3d 750, 766\n(9th Cir. 2000).\n  The Eighth Circuit considers three factors: (1) “the necessity of\nconsolidation due to the interrelationship among the [entities]”; (2)\n“whether the benefits of consolidation outweigh the harm to creditors”;\nand (3) “prejudice resulting from not consolidating the debtors.” In re\nGiller, 962 F.2d 796, 799 (8th Cir. 1992).\n  Finally, the D.C. and Eleventh Circuits have adopted a two-part test.\nFirst, the proponent of consolidation must make a prima facie case,\ndemonstrating: (1) that “there is substantial identity between the entities\nto be consolidated; and (2) [that] consolidation is necessary to avoid\nsome harm or to realize some benefit.” Eastgroup Props. v. S. Motel Ass’n,\nLtd., 935 F.2d 245, 249 (11th Cir. 1991); see also In re Auto-Train, 810\nF.2d 270, 276 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The Eastgroup Court noted that, in\nmaking this prima facie case, the proponent for consolidation may want\nto use the Vecco factors or the Ouimet factors discussed above.\n\f                                    23\n\n\ndetermine when substantively to consolidate two entities.\nWhile in the bankruptcy context the inquiry focuses\nprimarily on financial entanglement,8 for Title VII the focus\nmore often rests on the degree of operational entanglement\n— whether operations of the companies are so united that\nnominal employees of one company are treated\ninterchangeably with those of another. Relevant operational\nfactors include (1) the degree of unity between the entities\nwith respect to ownership, management (both directors and\nofficers), and business functions (e.g., hiring and personnel\nmatters), (2) whether they present themselves as a single\ncompany such that third parties dealt with them as one\nunit, (3) whether a parent company covers the salaries,\nexpenses, or losses of its subsidiary, and (4) whether one\nentity does business exclusively with the other. That is not\nto say that the considerations showing financial\nentanglement9 are not relevant in Title VII cases; they\nassuredly are. Indeed, the line between operational and\nfinancial may be blurred (e.g., when the third parties\ndealing with entities as one unit are creditors). However, we\nassume that financial entanglement will be present less\nfrequently in Title VII cases than in bankruptcy cases and\nwill be harder for a Title VII plaintiff to prove, given that a\ntypical Title VII plaintiff has more limited resources and an\n\nEastgroup, 935 F.2d at 249. Once the proponent for consolidation has\nmade this showing, “the burden shifts to an objecting creditor to show\nthat (1) it has relied on the separate credit of one of the entities to be\nconsolidated; and (2) it will be prejudiced by substantive consolidation.”\nId.; see In re Auto-Train, 810 F.2d at 276.\n8. See generally Mary Elizabeth Kors, Altered Egos: Deciphering\nSubstantive Consolidation, 49 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 381, 385 (1998) (“In cases\nwhere the disentanglement of the assets and liabilities of various entities\nis prohibitively expensive or even impossible, substantive consolidation\nmay significantly increase creditor recoveries.”).\n9. Among them are (1) the degree of difficulty in segregating and\nascertaining individual assets and liabilities, (2) the existence of\ntransfers of assets without formal observance of corporate formalities, (3)\nthe existence of parent and intercorporate loan guarantees, (4) whether\nthe subsidiary is grossly undercapitalized, and (5) the existence of\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\f                                   24\n\n\nattorney who does not specialize in financial transactions.10\nProving extensive financial entanglement will, however,\nbolster a Title VII plaintiff ’s case.\n  3.   Application of Our Disjunctive Test\n   Under the standard just discussed, and viewing the facts\nin the light most favorable to Nesbit, we nonetheless hold\nthat no reasonable jury would consider Gears and Winters\na single employer under Title VII for purposes of the fifteen-\nemployee requirement. First, there is no record evidence\nthat Gears and Winters split themselves into separate\nentities to evade Title VII. Nor has Nesbit alleged that Gears\nand Winters hold themselves out as one entity or that they\nremain separate only to evade anti-discrimination laws. On\nthe contrary, such a claim is implausible, as Vaughn Sr.\nassumed his ownership interests in Gears and Winters\nseventeen years apart, and the two companies produce\ndifferent products.\n  Second, because Gears and Winters do not have a\nparent-subsidiary relationship, the second situation for\ncombining employees (a direction from the parent to the\nsubsidiary to discriminate) does not exist. In any event,\nthere is no evidence that one corporation (Winters) ordered\nthe other (Gears) to commit a Title VII discriminatory act.\n  Finally, Nesbit sets out no evidence — other than Gears’\n\n10. Employees or prospective employees are generally not sophisticated\nparties and typically do not have the opportunity to conduct extensive\ndue diligence on employers to ascertain whether they will be protected by\nTitle VII should they accept an offer of employment. This is in contrast\nto the arms-length commercial transactional process by which parties\noften become creditors in a bankruptcy case. In that context, the parties\ntypically urging substantive consolidation are sophisticated and have\nhad an opportunity to conduct due diligence on the debtor in question\nto determine its assets, liabilities, and corporate structure, and to\nbargain accordingly. Thus, absent exceptional circumstances, voluntary\ncreditors should be able to recover only from the entity with which they\nhave bargained. See Christopher W. Frost, Organizational Form,\nMisappropriation Risk, and the Substantive Consolidation of Corporate\nGroups, 44 Hastings L.J. 449, 453 (1993) (“[U]nlike voluntary creditors,\ntort claimants are unable to bargain for protection against, or\ncompensation for, the increased risk limited liability imposes.”).\n\f                                  25\n\n\nand Winters’ common ownership — suggesting that\nsubstantive consolidation would make sense under the\nfactors discussed. The two companies have different\nmanagement. Nesbit described Randy Lau as “her boss”\nand conceded he was “more or less in charge” at Gears.\nWhile Vaughn Sr. fired Nesbit, we do not consider this a\nsignificant indication that Winters and Gears do not\noperate at arms length. Because Vaughn Sr. is president of\nGears and a ten percent shareholder, it is unsurprising\nthat he occasionally participated in Gears’ management.11\nHe was involved in Nesbit’s termination only because Lau\nwas unavailable on vacation when Nesbit was terminated.\nAdded to this, there is no indication that Gears and Winters\nignored corporate formalities.\n   That Gears and Winters coordinate in recruiting job\napplicants likewise does not make them a single entity\nunder Title VII. Our outcome might be different if Gears\nhad no say in hiring its own employees, if Gears and\nWinters held themselves out to job applicants as a single\ncompany, if the two companies’ human resources functions\nwere entirely integrated, and/or if they did not maintain\nseparate payrolls and finances. However, such a situation\nis not present here. Moreover, there is no record evidence\nthat third parties dealt with Gears and Winters as one unit,\nthat Gears and Winters covered the salaries of the other’s\nemployees, or that Gears and Winters did business\nexclusively with each other.\n  In the absence of more significant operational\nentanglement, common ownership and de minimis\ncoordination in hiring are insufficient bases to disregard\nthe separate corporate forms of Gears and Winters. We\ntherefore decline to view Gears and Winters as one entity\nfor Title VII purposes. As Nesbit concedes that Gears alone\nemploys fewer than fifteen employees, it is not an\n\n11. While Vaughn Sr. is a director of both Gears and Winters, this fact\ndoes not aid Nesbit here. His directorships are likely incidental to his\nstock ownership, as is often the case among closely held corporations.\nAnd as discussed, the overlapping ownership and management of Gears\nand Winters are insufficient, without more, to warrant substantive\nconsolidation.\n\f                              26\n\n\n“employer” under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b) and Nesbit’s suit\ncannot succeed.\n\n                    III.   CONCLUSION\n  We hold that whether an entity employs fifteen or more\nworkers is a merits question rather than a jurisdictional\ninquiry. Thus, because the District Court relied on\nmaterials external to the pleadings, it should have\nevaluated under the summary judgment standard Nesbit’s\nargument for viewing Gears and Winters collectively. Even\nunder that standard, there is no basis to view Gears and\nWinters together as a single employer. Because Gears alone\nemploys fewer than fifteen employees, we affirm the District\nCourt’s dismissal of Nesbit’s complaint, albeit on the merits\nrather than for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nA True Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                   Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n                               for the Third Circuit\n\f",

Norma Nesbit alleges that Gears\nUnlimited, Inc. (“Gears”) terminated her employment as a\nmachine operator because of her sex. She concedes that\nGears did not employ fifteen persons during the pertinent\ntime period, but argues that we should also count the\nemployees at a related entity, Winters Performance\nProducts (“Winters”). Together, Gears and Winters had\nmore than fifteen employees. We hold that the District\nCourt properly refused to aggregate the number of\nemployees at these companies. Because Title VII does not\ncover Gears by itself, we affirm the dismissal of Nesbit’s\ncomplaint. But we part with the District Court on the path\nto this result. It viewed Title VII’s “fifteen or more” person\nrequirement as jurisdictional. We affirm the dismissal of\nNesbit’s complaint on the merits rather than for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\n        I.   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  In 1973, Vaughn Winter, Sr. (“Vaughn Sr.”) founded\nWinters, which manufactures “rear ends” for high-\nperformance automobiles. In 1990, he acquired Gears, a\ntransmission parts manufacturer. Vaughn Sr. and his wife,\nMadeline Winter (“Madeline”), also formed Maverick\nIndustries, Inc. (“Maverick”), which warehouses automotive\nparts, including parts produced at Winters. At the time of\nthe events relating to this suit — December 1994 through\nAugust 1997 — Vaughn Sr. had a stake in three automotive\ncompanies: Gears, Winters, and Maverick.\n  The Winter family shares ownership and control of these\nthree companies. Vaughn Sr. owns ten percent of Gears,\nwith the remainder held in trust in equal shares for his\n\f                              3\n\n\nchildren — Nina and Vaughn Jr. Vaughn Sr. is president of\nGears and his children are corporate officers. He and\nMadeline own Winters and Maverick in equal shares. He is\npresident of Winters and Maverick, and Madeline is the\nSecretary/Treasurer at Winters.\n  Gears and Winters occupy separate plants about one\nmile apart in York, Pennsylvania. In almost all respects,\nthey operate independently. Their products are distinct —\nGears produces transmissions and Winters produces\nautomotive rear ends — and each company has its own\nequipment and production lines. Winters contracts to buy\nparts from Gears at market rates. The companies maintain\nseparate financial records and payrolls, write separate\nchecks, and file separate tax returns.\n  Vaughn Sr. monitors operations at both Gears and\nWinters. While he participates in day-to-day management\nat Winters, Gears is managed by Randy Lau. Vaughn Sr.\ntestified that he visits the Gears facility only about twice a\nmonth, usually because a machine has broken down.\nNesbit disputes this testimony, contending that Vaughn Sr.\nspends time at Gears “pretty much every day.”\n  The only area in which Gears and Winters cooperate\nconsiderably is in hiring. Typically, if either Gears or\nWinters has an opening, a Winters employee will place a\n“help wanted” sign on the street in front of the Winters\nbuilding. Prospective employees obtain applications at the\nWinters front office and return them there as well. If\nWinters is hiring, either Vaughn Sr. or his wife will invite\nqualified applicants for an interview. If Gears has an\nopening, someone at Winters will communicate with the\napplicant on Lau’s behalf and then direct him or her to the\nGears plant to interview with Lau. The hiring decision is\nthen Lau’s “prerogative.” However, Vaughn Sr. (who, as\nnoted above, normally does not participate in Gears\nmanagement) can request that Gears hire a particular\napplicant and Gears will generally do so. Either Lau or the\nWinter children normally decide whether to terminate an\nemployee, but Vaughn Sr. testified that he could ask Gears\nto fire an employee who engaged in significant misconduct.\n  On December 14, 1994, Nesbit submitted a standard\n\f                                4\n\n\nemployment application to Winters for a machine operator\nposition. That day, either Vaughn Sr. or Madeline\ninterviewed her.1 The interviewer concluded that no\navailable positions at Winters would be suitable for Nesbit\nand instead referred her to Gears, which hired her as a\nmachine operator.2 Vaughn Sr. personally accompanied\nNesbit to meet Lau, but the parties dispute whether\nVaughn Sr. or Lau actually made the hiring decision.\n   Nesbit remained at Gears for two years and eight months.\nShe perceived that Lau was her “boss” and was “more or\nless in charge” at Gears. Occasionally she also worked an\nextra shift at Winters following her regular shift at Gears.\nShe would punch out on the time clock at Gears and then\npunch in at Winters. When working a Winters shift, she\nreceived a separate paycheck. Her hours at the two plants\nwere not consolidated for overtime pay.\n  On August 19, 1997, Nesbit’s machine at Gears\n“crashed,” leaving it unusable without repairs. Nesbit\nbecame upset, which apparently caused her to develop a\nheadache and neck pains. She informed the acting\nsupervisor, Greg Pell, that she was leaving work to visit her\nchiropractor. When she returned the next day, Lau was on\nvacation,   and    Vaughn      Sr.   discharged    her    for\ninsubordination.\n   After receiving permission from the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, Nesbit filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania\nalleging that Gears discriminated against her because of\ngender. Gears moved to dismiss the complaint under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction on the basis that it employed fewer than\nfifteen persons during the relevant time period and\ntherefore was not an “employer” subject to Title VII.\n  Nesbit then filed an amended complaint alleging that\n\n1. The parties dispute whether Vaughn Sr. or Madeline conducted the\ninitial interview, though it is not important for our analysis.\n2. Nesbit is plaintiff ’s maiden name and the name she uses in this\nlitigation. The name on her employment application and in Gears’\nemployment records is Norma J. Tran.\n\f                                5\n\n\nGears and its “associate corporation” Winters Transmission,\nInc. — a company different from Winters that Vaughn Sr.\nowned from 1955 to 1985 — were really a single employer\nwith more than fifteen employees. Gears moved again for a\ndismissal, this time observing that the entity called\n“Winters Transmission, Inc.” had ceased operation long\nbefore Nesbit began working at Gears. Nesbit then filed a\nsecond amended complaint, alleging that Gears and\nWinters are associate corporations that together meet the\nfifteen-employee threshold. On the basis of that allegation,\nthe District Court ordered discovery limited to the question\nwhether Gears and Winters constitute a single employer\nunder Title VII. Following discovery, the District Court\nissued a memorandum and order in which it concluded\nthat Gears and Winters are separate entities and, because\nGears unquestionably employs fewer than fifteen persons\nby itself, dismissed Nesbit’s complaint for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction. This appeal followed.\n\n                     II.    DISCUSSION\nA.   Is the Number         of   Employees   a   Jurisdictional\n     Requirement?\n   We first address whether Title VII’s fifteen-employee\nthreshold is a jurisdictional prerequisite — as the District\nCourt believed it was in dismissing Nesbit’s complaint\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) — or whether it is a substantive\nelement of a Title VII claim. Whether an aspect of a claim\nconcerns subject matter jurisdiction or the merits has at\nleast three implications. First, because subject matter\njurisdiction is non-waivable, courts have an independent\nobligation to satisfy themselves of jurisdiction if it is in\ndoubt. See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 278 (1977). A necessary corollary is that the\ncourt can raise sua sponte subject-matter jurisdiction\nconcerns. Second, if the fifteen-employee requirement is not\njurisdictional, a Title VII claim for which the number of\nemployees is in doubt nonetheless will support\nsupplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 over state\nclaims.

Kinsho Int’l Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770727\"><a href=\"/opinion/770727/celia-da-silva-v-kinsho-international-corporation-and-haruo-maruyama/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362 &\n365 (2d Cir. 2000); 13B Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 3564, at 73-5 (2d ed. 1984). Third,\n\f                                   6\n\n\nin most contexts the question will be important to the\nplaintiff ’s burden of proof. If an aspect of a claim concerns\njurisdiction, and when jurisdiction turns on whether a\nparticular fact is true as here (as opposed to whether the\ncomplaint sufficiently alleges jurisdiction on its face), a\ncourt may inquire into the jurisdictional facts without\nviewing the evidence in a light favorable to either party. See\nMortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343137\"><a href=\"/opinion/343137/bent-e-mortensen-and-lise-lotte-mortensen-his-wife-individually-and-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n891 (3d Cir. 1977). By contrast, if an aspect of a claim\nconcerns the merits, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim a court must accept the\ncomplaint’s allegations as true, United States Express Lines\nLtd. v. Higgins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776649\"><a href=\"/opinion/776649/us-express-lines-ltd-brent-noyes-md-leo-hamilton-lenore-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 388 (3d Cir. 2002); on a Rule\n56 motion for summary judgment it must view the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the non-moving party and, if\nthere are disputes over genuine issues of material fact, they\nare for the jury to resolve, Huang v. BP Amoco Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775566\"><a href=\"/opinion/775566/joseph-huang-julia-y-huang-v-bp-amoco-corporation-joseph-huang-julia/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564 (3d Cir. 2001).\n  1.   Relevant Caselaw\n  The question whether Title VII’s fifteen-employee\nthreshold is a jurisdictional prerequisite when a plaintiff\nbrings a colorable Title VII claim has divided the courts of\nappeals.3 The Second and Seventh Circuits conclude that it\nis a substantive element that the plaintiff must prove\nunless the claim that there are fifteen employees is so\nobviously unfounded that it fails to raise a genuine federal\ncontroversy. Da Silva, 229 F.3d at 364-65 (2d Cir.);\n\n3. In Walters v.

Title VII’s Fifteen-Employee Requirement is an Element\n       of the Merits\n   With this conflict in mind, we begin our determination by\nnoting that subject matter jurisdiction is the “courts’\nstatutory or constitutional power to adjudicate” particular\ncases.

Steel Co. requires that\ncourts normally should not conflate subject matter\njurisdiction with elements of an action’s merits. The\nSupreme Court held that the elements of another federal\nstatute — the Emergency Planning and Community Right-\nTo-Know Act of 1986 (“EPCRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 11046(a)(1) —\nare not jurisdictional prerequisites. Steel Co., 523 U.S. at\n90-93. In relevant part, EPCRA requires users of specified\nhazardous chemicals to file annual reports detailing their\nchemical inventories, waste-disposal methods, and recent\nreleases of chemicals from their facilities into the\nenvironment, and provides that the “district courts shall\nhave jurisdiction in actions brought under subsection (a) of\nthis section against an owner or operator of a facility to\nenforce the requirement concerned and to impose any civil\npenalty provided for violation of that requirement.” 42\nU.S.C. § 11046(c). The Steel Co. plaintiff, a group to protect\nenvironmental rights, sued a Chicago manufacturer and\nasserted past violations of EPCRA. After being notified that\nit was in arrears on its filings, the manufacturer filed all\nthe overdue reports. The plaintiff nonetheless continued its\nsuit, seeking relief for past reporting violations.\n  The District Court concluded that EPCRA does not\nsupport suits for past violations and therefore dismissed\nthe plaintiff ’s complaint under both Rules 12(b)(1) and\n12(b)(6). The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nreversed, holding that EPCRA permits such suits. The\nSupreme Court determined that the case raised (1) whether\n\nInc. v.

In so\ndoing, Steel Co. rejected attempts to portray the\nrequirement to prove all elements of a cause of action as\nrelevant to federal courts’ jurisdiction to hear a suit. The\nCourt reasoned that “[i]t is firmly established in our cases\nthat absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of\naction does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction.” Id. at\n89. On the contrary,\n    ‘[j]urisdiction . . . is not defeated . . . by the possibility\n    that the averments might fail to state a cause of action\n    on which petitioners could actually recover.’ Rather,\n    the district court has jurisdiction if ‘the right of the\n    petitioners to recover under their complaint will be\n    sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United\n    States are given one construction and will be defeated\n    if they are given another . . . .’\nId. at 89 (quoting Bell v.

Id. at 92-93.\nUnder that approach, each element of every cause of action\nwould have a legitimate claim to being a jurisdictional\nrequirement — essentially eviscerating the distinction\nbetween the jurisdictional and merits inquiry (and requiring\na court to dismiss a claim for lack of jurisdiction whenever\nthe plaintiff does not prevail). The Court made plain,\nhowever, that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking if the\nalleged basis for jurisdiction “clearly appears to be\nimmaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining\njurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial\nor frivolous.” Id. at 89.\n  We presaged Steel Co. in a case decided five years earlier.\nIn Growth Horizons, Inc. v.

The Fair Housing Act makes it\nunlawful, inter alia, “[t]o discriminate in the sale or rental,\n\f                                    11\n\n\nor to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any\nbuyer or renter because of a handicap.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(f)(1). The District Court concluded that the\ndefendant did not “make unavailable or deny” housing to\nthe plaintiff and that the Fair Housing Act was therefore\nnot implicated. We reversed, holding that “[a] district court\nhas federal question jurisdiction in any case where a\nplaintiff with standing makes a non-frivolous allegation that\nhe or she is entitled to relief because the defendant’s\nconduct violated a federal statute.” Growth Horizons, 983\nF.2d at 1281. We further explained that “[d]ismissal for lack\nof jurisdiction is not appropriate merely because the legal\ntheory alleged is probably false, but only because the right\nclaimed is ‘so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior\ndecisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of\nmerit as not to involve a federal controversy.’ ” Id. at 1280-\n81 (citing Kulick v.

The Restatement (Second) of Judgments: Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n§ 11 (1982) also addresses the question whether an issue affects subject\nmatter jurisdiction or the merits, ultimately concluding that there is no\nprincipled way to distinguish between the two. It notes that “[t]here is a\nstrong tendency in procedural law to treat various kinds of serious\nprocedural errors as defects in subject matter jurisdiction . . . because\ncharacterizing a court’s departure in exercising authority as\n‘jurisdictional’ permits an objection to the departure to be taken\nbelatedly.” Restatement (Second) of Judgments: Subject Matter\nJurisdiction § 11 cmt. e. Relevant to the question here, it goes on to note\nthat\n    [t]he difficult problems are encountered when the issues on which\n    the court’s subject matter jurisdiction depends are not so clearcut.\n    [For example,] if the court has jurisdiction of actions of more than\n    a specified amount, there can be uncertainty in whether a particular\n    claim exceeds that amount. The problem can be particularly difficult\n\f                                   12\n\n\n   Turning to Title VII, we note that those courts that have\nheld the fifteen-employee requirement jurisdictional have\nprovided no reasons for their holding; rather, they have\nassumed it so or stated the conclusion without meaningful\nanalysis. Moreover, in reading 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b) we\nperceive no congressional intent to make the requirement\njurisdictional. Indeed, Title VII contains an explicit\njurisdictional section, § 2000e-5(f)(3), which provides that\n“[e]ach United States district court and each United States\ncourt of a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United\nStates shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this\nsubchapter.” By contrast, § 2000e(b) — in which the fifteen-\nemployee requirement appears — is a definitional section,\ndefining “employer.” We doubt that Congress intended this\ndefinitional section to have subject matter jurisdictional\nimport. If Congress had so intended, we believe its intention\nwould be clearer. Notably, § 2000e(b) does not even contain\nthe word “jurisdiction.” Compare 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (“The\ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil\nactions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of\nthe United States.”); id. § 1332 (explicitly making diverse\ncitizenship    and    a    $75,000     amount-in-controversy\njurisdictional prerequisites). Moreover, congressional debate\n(albeit postdating the requirement that an “employer” have\nmore than fifteen employees) reveals that at least some\nlegislators regard the fifteen-employee minimum not as\njurisdictional but as an element of the cause of action. See\n137 Cong. Rec. H9505-01 (Daily ed. Nov. 7, 1991)\n(statement of Rep. Brooks) (“[W]hen a company has less\nthan 15 employees, there are no damages available\nwhatsoever because there is no cause of action under our\ncurrent antidiscrimination statutes.”).\n\n\n\n\n    when the issue determining subject matter jurisdiction parallels an\n    issue going to the merits.\nId. In those cases the Restatement concludes that “the matter in\nquestion can plausibly be characterized either as going to subject matter\njurisdiction or as being one of merits or procedure.” Id.\n\f                               13\n\n\n  3.     Most Plausible Arguments for Making             Fifteen-\n         Employee Requirement Jurisdictional\n\n    a.    Commerce Clause Argument\n   Perhaps the most plausible reason for finding that the\nfifteen-employee requirement is jurisdictional is that it\nconcerns a “dispute[ ] as to the existence of a fact that is\nessential to a constitutional exercise of Congress’s power to\nregulate.” Da Silva, 229 F.3d at 363 (suggesting this as a\nsituation “[l]ess clearly placed on one side of the\njurisdiction/merits line”). As discussed, Title VII applies to\n“employers” and defines an “employer” (in relevant part) as\n“a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who\nhas fifteen or more employees.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).\nBecause Congress enacted Title VII under its Commerce\nClause power, EEOC v. Ratliff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543790\"><a href=\"/opinion/543790/53-fair-emplpraccas-267-53-empl-prac-dec-p-40018-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1315-16 (9th\nCir. 1990), the requirement that an employer be “in an\nindustry affecting commerce” is the statute’s constitutional\nbasis. And because the requirements that the employer be\n“in an industry affecting commerce” and that the employer\nhave “fifteen or more employees” appear side by side in the\nstatute, it is arguably reasonable to read § 2000e(b)’s\n“fifteen employee” minimum as relevant to Title VII’s\nCommerce Clause basis as well. That is, one might read the\nfifteen-employee        threshold   as    reflecting  Congress’s\ndetermination that only those companies with fifteen or\nmore employees have the requisite substantial effect on\ninterstate commerce to permit Congress to enact the\nstatute. See Legislative History of Titles VII and XI of Civil\nRights Act of 1964, at 2108 (1964) (“The bill proceeds upon\na theory . . . that the quantum of employees is a rational\nyardstick by which the interstate commerce concept can be\nmeasured.”) (separate minority views of Reps.

Larson, Employment Discrimination § 5.31, at\n2-40 (1987)).\n   This argument, while well-made, nonetheless is\nunconvincing. First, the very wording of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e(b) suggests that the requirements that an employer\nbe “in an industry affecting commerce” and have “fifteen or\nmore employees” are separate and independent, and that it\nis a mistake to conflate the two. Even if a putative employer\nhas twenty employees, it is not covered by Title VII if not in\nan industry affecting commerce. Second, while the\npreceding Commerce Clause-based justification for Title\nVII’s fifteen-employee requirement makes intuitive sense, it\nfinds little support in the legislative history. We note that\nthe 1972 amendments to Title VII lowered the minimum\nnumber of employees from twenty-five to fifteen. Patricia\nDavidson, Comment, The Definition of “Employee” Under\nTitle    VII:  Distinguishing    Between     Employees    and\nIndependent Contractors, 53 U. Cin. L. Rev. 203, 206 (1984)\n(noting this change). It lacks logic that, pre-1972, Congress\nbelieved that it took twenty-five employees for a substantial\neffect on interstate commerce but changed its mind in\n1972. Furthermore, as initially proposed, the 1972\namendment to Title VII contained an eight-employee\nthreshold. See Armbruster, 711 F.2d at 1337 n.4. The\nthreshold was ultimately raised to fifteen employees as the\nresult of a political compromise, see id., in order (among\nother reasons) “to protect ethnic businesses and small\nbusinesses.” Davidson, supra, at 206 & n.23. Thus, the\nfifteen-employee threshold appears motivated by policy —\nto spare small companies the expense of complying with\nTitle VII — rather than Commerce Clause considerations.\n  Even assuming that Congress lacks authority to enact a\nstatute does not mean that a federal court lacks\njurisdiction to review actions brought under that statute.\nWhen disposing of a claim brought under an\nunconstitutional statute, courts ordinarily deny the claim\non the merits, on the ground that the statute under which\nrelief is sought is unconstitutional, rather than for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction.

In that case, the Supreme\nCourt decided whether Title VII “applies extraterritorially to\nregulate the employment practices of United States\nemployers who employ United States citizens abroad.” Id. at\n246. The Court addressed the question not as whether Title\nVII granted plaintiffs a cause of action for extraterritorial\nviolations, but rather whether Title VII granted\nextraterritorial jurisdiction, see id. at 250, and affirmed the\ndismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Id. at\n259. In Arabian American Oil Co., however, a policy\nconsideration       —     namely,    the    significant   effect\nextraterritorial application of U.S. law might have on\ninternational      relations    —     favored    viewing     the\nextraterritoriality question as one of jurisdiction. That is,\neven if parties did not raise the question of Title VII’s\nextraterritorial application, Congress would likely have\nintended courts to raise the issue sua sponte in the interest\nof harmonious international relations. Such concerns of\ninternational comity are not present here.\n  By analogy, some may find EEOC v.

In that\ncase, the Supreme Court stated that “Title VII does not give\nthe EEOC jurisdiction to enforce the Act against employers\nof fewer that 15 employees.” Id. at 119 n.5. But this does\nnot address the question before us. Title VII grants the\nEEOC power “to prevent any person from engaging in any\nunlawful employment practice.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(a).\nThus, if an entity (a “person” under the statute) employs\n\f                              16\n\n\nfewer than fifteen employees, by § 2000e-5(a)’s terms, the\nEEOC lacks power (jurisdiction). By contrast, Title VII’s\njurisdictional grant to the federal courts is broader. See id.\n§ 2000e-5(f)(3) (“Each United States district court and each\nUnited States court of a place subject to the jurisdiction of\nthe United States shall have jurisdiction of actions brought\nunder this subchapter.”).\n  4.   Judicial Administration Reasons for Fifteen-Employee\n       Requirement Being an Element of a Title VII Claim\n       rather than a Jurisdictional Requirement\n   As a policy matter — which is ultimately the gut of our\ninquiry — it also makes little sense to regard the fifteen-\nemployee threshold as jurisdictional. Such a holding would\nrequire a federal court to determine whether a company\nhad fifteen employees during the relevant period, even if the\nparties so stipulated. To require a federal court to engage in\nsuch a fact-intensive inquiry sua sponte — which might in\nsome cases require a federal appellate court to dig through\nan extensive record, including pay stubs and time sheets —\nappears to be a waste of scarce judicial resources, and we\ndoubt that Congress intended such a result. See Da Silva,\n229 F.3d at 365 (“[I]nstitutional requirements of a judicial\nsystem weigh in favor of narrowing the number of facts or\ncircumstances that determine subject matter jurisdiction.”);\nSharpe, 148 F.3d at 678 (“Surely the number of employees\nis not the sort of question a court (including appellate\ncourt) must raise on its own . . . .”).\n  To hold the requirement jurisdictional also implies that a\ncourt would need to decide whether an entity employed\nmore than fifteen individuals before reaching a Title VII\naction’s merits — even if the merits were more easily\nresolved than the “jurisdictional” question. Steel Co., 523\nU.S. at 94-95. This result too is undesirable.\n                       * * * * * * * * *\n   In this context, we hold that, while the matter is not free\nfrom doubt, the fifteen-employee threshold is a substantive\nelement (whether an “employer” exists) of a Title VII claim\nand is not jurisdictional. Federal jurisdiction is implicated\nonly when the Title VII claim “clearly appears to be\nimmaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining\n\f                               17\n\n\njurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial\nor frivolous,” Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 89, neither of which is\nthe case here.\nB.        Should We Consolidate the Number of Employees at\n          Gears and Winters?\n  As the District Court looked beyond Nesbit’s complaint\nand reviewed discovery on whether Gears employs more\nthan fifteen people, it should have resolved the issue under\nthe summary judgment standard rather than as a motion\nfor judgment on the pleadings. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).\nNonetheless, we may affirm its disposition for any reason\nsupported by the record. Grayson v.

If the company at issue satisfies the\nNLRB test, it will in many cases be required to submit to\ncollective bargaining. Crandley, supra, at 1064. But if a\ndefendant in a Title VII suit is deemed an “employer” within\nthe meaning of the statute, it may be subject to liability.\n   Because the NLRA and Title VII ask whether entities are\na single enterprise for different reasons, it does not follow\nthat the NLRB’s test is any more relevant to Title VII cases\nthan any of the other tests for determining whether two\ncompanies should be regarded as one. To the contrary, for\npurposes of determining whether two companies are a\nsingle employer, the NLRA’s policy goals point in a different\ndirection than Title VII’s. As discussed, a significant\npurpose of the fifteen-employee minimum in the Title VII\ncontext is to spare small companies the considerable\nexpense of complying with the statute’s many-nuanced\nrequirements. See Papa, 166 F.3d at 940; Armbruster, 711\nF.2d at 1337 n.4 (reviewing the legislative history behind\nthe fifteen-employee minimum). This goal suggests that the\nfifteen-employee minimum should be strictly construed. By\ncontrast, the NLRB’s jurisdiction was intended to be\nexpansive, suggesting a more lenient test for labor cases.\nSee Crandley, supra, at 1065-66. Thus we deem there is\nlittle reason to refer to the NLRB’s test in deciding whether\ntwo entities should together be considered an “employer”\nfor Title VII purposes. We instead adopt a different\nframework, tailored to Title VII’s policy goals.\n  2.   Our Framework\n   In Papa, the Seventh Circuit developed its own test to\ndetermine whether two nominally distinct entities should be\nconsidered as one for Title VII purposes. The Court began\nwith the “basic principle of affiliate liability[,] . . . that an\naffiliate forfeits its limited liability only if it acts to forfeit it.”\nId. at 941 (emphasis in original). It proceeded to find three\nsituations in the Title VII context when a company and its\naffiliates forfeit limited liability and thus are deemed a\nsingle employer: (1) where a company has split itself into\nentities with less than fifteen employees with the intent to\n\f                              20\n\n\nevade Title VII’s reach; (2) when a parent company has\ndirected the subsidiary’s discriminatory act of which the\nplaintiff is complaining; or (3) when a court would\notherwise pierce the corporate veil (i.e., look behind the\ncorporate form to hold a corporation’s shareholders\npersonally liable). Id. at 940-41.\n   We too will consider a company and its affiliates a single\nemployer under Title VII (1) when a company has split itself\ninto entities with less than fifteen employees intending to\nevade Title VII’s reach or (2) when a parent company has\ndirected the subsidiary’s discriminatory act of which the\nplaintiff is complaining. However, on the third part of this\ndisjunctive test, we articulate a slightly different standard\nfrom the Seventh Circuit. Rather than applying the test for\nveil piercing imported from the corporation law context\n(because individual shareholder liability is not implicated\nhere), we will apply the factors courts use to determine\nwhen substantively to consolidate two or more entities in\nthe bankruptcy context. When courts substantively\nconsolidate two entities, they treat the assets and liabilities\nof each as belonging to a single entity. We explain in\nfurther detail each test.\n\n    a.   Splitting a Single Company into Two or More to\n         Evade Title VII\n  When a plaintiff proves that a company has split itself\ninto multiple entities to evade coverage under Title VII, we\nconsider those entities a single company for purposes of\nmeeting the fifteen-employee threshold. “The privilege of\nseparate incorporation is not intended to allow enterprises\nto duck their statutory duties.” Id. at 941.\n  A plaintiff need not prove that evading Title VII was the\nonly reason that a business split itself into multiple\nentities. Rather, it must make a prima facie case that this\nwas a substantial motivating factor, after which the burden\nwill shift to the defendant to produce evidence rebutting the\nplaintiff ’s proof. Relevant to a prima facie case are\nconsiderations such as (1) lack of a reasonable business\njustification, (2) whether the business split was one that, as\nan operational matter, would more sensibly be contained\n\f                                   21\n\n\nwithin a single business entity (e.g., the two companies\nmake the same product or inputs for the same product),\nand (3) statements from those familiar with the industry\nsuggesting that the company was split into multiple entities\nto evade Title VII.\n\n    b.   Parent Directing Subsidiary’s Act\n   When the companies sought to be aggregated for Title VII\npurposes are in a parent-subsidiary relationship, we shall\ndeem a parent and subsidiary a single employer when the\nparent has directed the subsidiary to perform the allegedly\ndiscriminatory act in question. By directing such an act,\nthe parent disregards the separate corporate existence of\nthe subsidiary and thus forfeits the right to be treated as a\nseparate entity for Title VII purposes. Moreover, in such a\nsituation the parent itself has committed the act in\nquestion and thus should share responsibility with the\nsubsidiary. See Papa, 166 F.3d at 941.\n\n    c.   Substantive Consolidation\n   Absent either of the first two situations, we shall look to\nthe factors courts use in deciding whether substantively to\nconsolidate two or more entities in the bankruptcy context.\nWhile these factors vary from circuit to circuit, the test at\nbase seeks to determine whether two or more entities’\naffairs are so interconnected that they collectively caused\nthe alleged discriminatory employment practice. More\ncolloquially, the question is whether the “eggs” — consisting\nof the ostensibly separate companies — are so scrambled\nthat we decline to unscramble them. We note, however,\nthat substantive consolidation is an equitable remedy and\nis difficult to achieve.7\n\n7. In addressing whether substantively to consolidate two entities in the\nbankruptcy context, courts have developed a number of different tests.\nSome have applied a seven-factor test, first set forth in In re Vecco\nConstruction Industries, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1538713\"><a href=\"/opinion/1538713/in-re-vecco-const-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Bankr.

The Eastgroup Court noted that, in\nmaking this prima facie case, the proponent for consolidation may want\nto use the Vecco factors or the Ouimet factors discussed above.\n\f                                    23\n\n\ndetermine when substantively to consolidate two entities.\nWhile in the bankruptcy context the inquiry focuses\nprimarily on financial entanglement,8 for Title VII the focus\nmore often rests on the degree of operational entanglement\n— whether operations of the companies are so united that\nnominal employees of one company are treated\ninterchangeably with those of another. Relevant operational\nfactors include (1) the degree of unity between the entities\nwith respect to ownership, management (both directors and\nofficers), and business functions (e.g., hiring and personnel\nmatters), (2) whether they present themselves as a single\ncompany such that third parties dealt with them as one\nunit, (3) whether a parent company covers the salaries,\nexpenses, or losses of its subsidiary, and (4) whether one\nentity does business exclusively with the other. That is not\nto say that the considerations showing financial\nentanglement9 are not relevant in Title VII cases; they\nassuredly are. Indeed, the line between operational and\nfinancial may be blurred (e.g., when the third parties\ndealing with entities as one unit are creditors). However, we\nassume that financial entanglement will be present less\nfrequently in Title VII cases than in bankruptcy cases and\nwill be harder for a Title VII plaintiff to prove, given that a\ntypical Title VII plaintiff has more limited resources and an\n\nEastgroup, 935 F.2d at 249. Once the proponent for consolidation has\nmade this showing, “the burden shifts to an objecting creditor to show\nthat (1) it has relied on the separate credit of one of the entities to be\nconsolidated; and (2) it will be prejudiced by substantive consolidation.”\nId.; see In re Auto-Train, 810 F.2d at 276.\n8. See generally Mary Elizabeth Kors, Altered Egos: Deciphering\nSubstantive Consolidation, 49 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 381, 385 (1998) (“In cases\nwhere the disentanglement of the assets and liabilities of various entities\nis prohibitively expensive or even impossible, substantive consolidation\nmay significantly increase creditor recoveries.”).\n9. Among them are (1) the degree of difficulty in segregating and\nascertaining individual assets and liabilities, (2) the existence of\ntransfers of assets without formal observance of corporate formalities, (3)\nthe existence of parent and intercorporate loan guarantees, (4) whether\nthe subsidiary is grossly undercapitalized, and (5) the existence of\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\f                                   24\n\n\nattorney who does not specialize in financial transactions.10\nProving extensive financial entanglement will, however,\nbolster a Title VII plaintiff ’s case.\n  3.   Application of Our Disjunctive Test\n   Under the standard just discussed, and viewing the facts\nin the light most favorable to Nesbit, we nonetheless hold\nthat no reasonable jury would consider Gears and Winters\na single employer under Title VII for purposes of the fifteen-\nemployee requirement. First, there is no record evidence\nthat Gears and Winters split themselves into separate\nentities to evade Title VII. Nor has Nesbit alleged that Gears\nand Winters hold themselves out as one entity or that they\nremain separate only to evade anti-discrimination laws. On\nthe contrary, such a claim is implausible, as Vaughn Sr.\nassumed his ownership interests in Gears and Winters\nseventeen years apart, and the two companies produce\ndifferent products.\n  Second, because Gears and Winters do not have a\nparent-subsidiary relationship, the second situation for\ncombining employees (a direction from the parent to the\nsubsidiary to discriminate) does not exist. In any event,\nthere is no evidence that one corporation (Winters) ordered\nthe other (Gears) to commit a Title VII discriminatory act.\n  Finally, Nesbit sets out no evidence — other than Gears’\n\n10. Employees or prospective employees are generally not sophisticated\nparties and typically do not have the opportunity to conduct extensive\ndue diligence on employers to ascertain whether they will be protected by\nTitle VII should they accept an offer of employment. This is in contrast\nto the arms-length commercial transactional process by which parties\noften become creditors in a bankruptcy case. In that context, the parties\ntypically urging substantive consolidation are sophisticated and have\nhad an opportunity to conduct due diligence on the debtor in question\nto determine its assets, liabilities, and corporate structure, and to\nbargain accordingly. Thus, absent exceptional circumstances, voluntary\ncreditors should be able to recover only from the entity with which they\nhave bargained. See Christopher W. Frost, Organizational Form,\nMisappropriation Risk, and the Substantive Consolidation of Corporate\nGroups, 44 Hastings L.J. 449, 453 (1993) (“[U]nlike voluntary creditors,\ntort claimants are unable to bargain for protection against, or\ncompensation for, the increased risk limited liability imposes.”).\n\f                                  25\n\n\nand Winters’ common ownership — suggesting that\nsubstantive consolidation would make sense under the\nfactors discussed. The two companies have different\nmanagement. Nesbit described Randy Lau as “her boss”\nand conceded he was “more or less in charge” at Gears.\nWhile Vaughn Sr. fired Nesbit, we do not consider this a\nsignificant indication that Winters and Gears do not\noperate at arms length. Because Vaughn Sr. is president of\nGears and a ten percent shareholder, it is unsurprising\nthat he occasionally participated in Gears’ management.11\nHe was involved in Nesbit’s termination only because Lau\nwas unavailable on vacation when Nesbit was terminated.\nAdded to this, there is no indication that Gears and Winters\nignored corporate formalities.\n   That Gears and Winters coordinate in recruiting job\napplicants likewise does not make them a single entity\nunder Title VII. Our outcome might be different if Gears\nhad no say in hiring its own employees, if Gears and\nWinters held themselves out to job applicants as a single\ncompany, if the two companies’ human resources functions\nwere entirely integrated, and/or if they did not maintain\nseparate payrolls and finances. However, such a situation\nis not present here. Moreover, there is no record evidence\nthat third parties dealt with Gears and Winters as one unit,\nthat Gears and Winters covered the salaries of the other’s\nemployees, or that Gears and Winters did business\nexclusively with each other.\n  In the absence of more significant operational\nentanglement, common ownership and de minimis\ncoordination in hiring are insufficient bases to disregard\nthe separate corporate forms of Gears and Winters. We\ntherefore decline to view Gears and Winters as one entity\nfor Title VII purposes. As Nesbit concedes that Gears alone\nemploys fewer than fifteen employees, it is not an\n\n11. While Vaughn Sr. is a director of both Gears and Winters, this fact\ndoes not aid Nesbit here. His directorships are likely incidental to his\nstock ownership, as is often the case among closely held corporations.\nAnd as discussed, the overlapping ownership and management of Gears\nand Winters are insufficient, without more, to warrant substantive\nconsolidation.\n\f                              26\n\n\n“employer” under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b) and Nesbit’s suit\ncannot succeed.\n\n                    III.   CONCLUSION\n  We hold that whether an entity employs fifteen or more\nworkers is a merits question rather than a jurisdictional\ninquiry. Thus, because the District Court relied on\nmaterials external to the pleadings, it should have\nevaluated under the summary judgment standard Nesbit’s\nargument for viewing Gears and Winters collectively. Even\nunder that standard, there is no basis to view Gears and\nWinters together as a single employer. Because Gears alone\nemploys fewer than fifteen employees, we affirm the District\nCourt’s dismissal of Nesbit’s complaint, albeit on the merits\nrather than for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nA True Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                   Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n                               for the Third Circuit\n\f</pre>",
