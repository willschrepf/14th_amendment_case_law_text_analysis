Standing\n\n      The district court concluded that John Roe #2 lacked standing because,\n\nhaving not yet graduated from law school or passed the bar exam, he did not face\n\nimminent injury. Id. at 253. For this same reason, the district court concluded\n\nthat the Potter Chapter lacked associational standing. Id. at 254. According to\n\nthe district court, the Students’ injuries were not redressible: “If this court were to\n\nenjoin the defendants from continuing to ask the three challenged questions, the\n\nBar Committee may and presumably would find other means to make the inquiries\n\nnecessary to determine the fitness of applicants.” Id. at 251. The district court\n\nerred in holding that the Students lacked standing.\n\n      1.     John Roe #2’s Standing\n\n      We review the question of standing de novo. Sac & Fox Nation of Mo. v.\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fPierce, 213 F.3d 566, 571 (10th Cir. 2000), cert denied, 121 S. Ct. 1078 (2001).\n\nThe constitutional requirements for standing are (1) an injury in fact, (2) a causal\n\nconnection between the injury and the challenged act, and (3) a likelihood that the\n\ninjury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Vermont Agency of Natural Res.\n\nv. United States ex. rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 771 (2000). The alleged injury\n\nmust be concrete and particularized and imminent or actual, as opposed to\n\nconjectural or hypothetical. Id. “At the pleading stage, general factual\n\nallegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice, for on a\n\nmotion to dismiss we presum[e] that general allegations embrace those specific\n\nfacts that are necessary to support the claim.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (citations and internal quotations omitted) (alteration in\n\noriginal).\n\n             i.    Injury-in-fact\n\n      John Roe #2 faces imminent injury. 3 He has graduated and will sit for the\n\nbar exam in July. Since he has disclosed his past treatment for alcohol, drug, or\n\nnarcotic use in his application, John Roe #2 will be subject to Board\n\ninvestigation, which he believes violates the ADA and Constitution. The fact that\n\nJohn Roe #2 could fail the bar exam does not defeat standing because John Roe\n\n\n\n      3\n        In light of this conclusion, we do not reach the Students’ contention that\nthey have also suffered actual injury.\n\n                                         -6-\n\f#2 has alleged more than “some day intentions.” Id. at 564 (internal quotations).\n\nA plaintiff is required only to allege concrete plans; id., he is not required to\n\nsuccessfully execute those plans. See Buchwald v. Univ. of New Mexico Sch. of\n\nMed., 159 F.3d 487, 493 (10th Cir. 1998) (plaintiff required to make “an adequate\n\nshowing that she will re-apply to [medical school]” to have standing (citation and\n\ninternal quotations omitted)).\n\n      Bryant v. Yellen, 447 U.S. 352, 366-68 (1980), cited with approval by\n\nClinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 432 (1998), supports this conclusion.\n\nIn Bryant, the district court held that privately owned farmland in Imperial Valley\n\nin California was not subject to a provision in the Boulder Canyon Project Act, 43\n\nU.S.C. § 617, which “limited water deliveries from reclamation projects to 160\n\nacres under single ownership.” Id. at 355. Certain Imperial Valley residents\n\nsought to intervene and appeal the decision. Id. at 366. They asserted standing\n\non the basis that they desired to purchase farmland in Imperial Valley that might\n\nbecome available if the acre limitation was held to be applicable. Id. However,\n\nthe residents “could not with certainty establish that they would be able to\n\npurchase excess lands if [the provision] were held applicable.” Id. at 367. It was\n\nuncertain whether owners of excess land would sell, whether the residents had\n\nsufficient financial resources to purchase the land, and whether the residents\n\nwould be outbid by other potential purchasers. Id. at 367 & n.17. These\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\funcertainties notwithstanding, the residents had standing because it was likely\n\nthat the residents would purchase the excess lands if the acre limitation was\n\napplicable. Id. at 368. The facts in this case are far more compelling. Having\n\ninvested three years of time and resources to complete law school, John Roe #2\n\nwill sit for the bar exam. Furthermore, it is likely that John Roe #2 will pass the\n\nbar exam. Over 80% of University of Denver College of Law students who have\n\ntaken the Colorado bar exam for the first time in recent years have passed.\n\nColorado Supreme Court Board of Law Examiners’ Web Page, Pass/Fail Rates by\n\nLaw School: February 2001 Bar Examination, at\n\nhttp://www.courts.state.co.us/ble/results/LawSchoolStats0102.htm (last visited\n\nJune 1, 2001); Colorado Supreme Court Board of Law Examiners’ Web Page,\n\nPass/Fail Rates by Law School: July 2000 Bar Examination, at\n\nhttp://www.courts.state.co.us/ble/results/LawSchoolStats0007.htm (last visited\n\nJune 1, 2001).\n\n             ii.    Redressibility\n\n      John Roe #2’s injury is redressible. An injury is redressible if “the\n\nprospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling is not\n\ntoo speculative.” Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated Gen.\n\nContractors of America v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 663-64 (1993)\n\n(citation and internal quotations omitted). Litigation has proven to be an\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\feffective vehicle to abolish or circumscribe questions like those in dispute here.\n\nSee, e.g. Clark v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exam’rs, 880 F. Supp. 430, 440 (E.D. Va.\n\n1995) (“At least eight states . . . have recently altered their mental health\n\nquestions in light of potential or actual litigation under the ADA.”). The district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that the Board could obtain the same instruction by “other\n\nmeans,” Aplt. App. at 251, does not persuade us otherwise. The district court\n\nfailed to identify “other means” by which the Board could obtain similar\n\ninformation, and we presume that the Board would obey a lawful order should\n\nrelief be granted. We therefore hold that John Roe #2’s injury is redressible.\n\n      This case is distinguishable from our decision in Wilson v. Glenwood\n\nIntermountain Properties, Inc., 98 F.3d 590 (10th Cir. 1996). In Wilson, the\n\nplaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the operation of gender-segregated and\n\nsingle-gender apartments reserved solely for Brigham Young University students\n\nbecause “[a]s non-students, . . . they would not have qualified to rent the student\n\napartments.” Id. at 594. By way of contrast, John Roe #2 is eligible to apply for\n\nadmission to the bar. If he obtains a favorable judgment and passes the bar exam,\n\nhis application will be considered without the accompanying investigation into his\n\npast history of alcohol dependency. Accordingly, unlike the plaintiffs’ injury in\n\nWilson, John Roe #2’s injury is redressible.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f      2.     Potter Chapter’s Standing\n\n      The Potter Chapter must satisfy three requirements to have associational\n\nstanding:\n\n      (a) [I]ts members [must] otherwise have standing to sue in their own\n      right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect [must be] germane to the\n      organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the\n      relief requested [must] require[] the participation of individual\n      members in the lawsuit.\n\nUnited Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v. Brown Group, Inc.,\n\n517 U.S. 544, 553 (1996) (quoting Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver.\n\nComm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)). As explained, John Roe #2 has standing.\n\nBecause John Roe #2 is a member of the Potter Chapter, the fact that he has\n\nstanding is sufficient to satisfy the first requirement. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.\n\n490, 511 (1975) (“The association must allege that its members, or any one of\n\nthem are suffering immediate or threatened injury . . . .” (emphasis added)). It is\n\nnot disputed that the Potter Chapter satisfies the remaining two requirements.\n\nAccordingly, the Potter Chapter has associational standing.\n\nA.    Ripeness\n\n      The district court concluded that the Students’ action was not ripe because\n\nit involved uncertain or contingent future events. Aplt. App. at 254-55 (Second\n\nAmended Complaint). The district court erred in so concluding.\n\n      We review the issue of ripeness de novo. Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1,\n\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\fDenver, Colo., 119 F.3d 1437, 1444 (10th Cir. 1997). Because the Students’ face\n\nimminent injury, they also satisfy the constitutional requirements of ripeness.\n\nAm. Civil Liberties Union v. Johnson, 194 F.3d 1149, 1155 (10th Cir. 1999);\n\naccord Nat’l Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1427\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996). Therefore, the Students’ action is ripe unless the prudential\n\naspects of ripeness counsel against consideration. Nat’l Treasury Employees\n\nUnion, 101 F.3d at 1427-28.\n\n      The ripeness doctrine cautions a court against premature adjudication of\n\ndisputes involving administrative policies or decisions not yet formalized and felt\n\nin a concrete way by the challenging parties. Qwest Communications Int’l, Inc. v.\n\nF.C.C., 240 F.3d 886, 893 (10th Cir. 2001); see also Abbott Laboratories v.\n\nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967), overruled on other grounds, Califano v\n\nSanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977). The ripeness inquiry is threefold: “(1) whether\n\ndelayed review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs; (2) whether judicial\n\nintervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action;\n\nand (3) whether the courts would benefit from further factual development of the\n\nissues presented.” Qwest, 240 F.3d at 893-94 (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n v.\n\nSierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 732-33 (1998)). In the context of the facts of this\n\ncase, none of these considerations counsel against consideration of the Students’\n\naction.\n\n\n                                        - 11 -\n\f      Delayed review will cause the Students hardship. The questions on the bar\n\napplication and related investigations will have a “direct and immediate impact”\n\nupon the Students. Id. at 894 (quoting Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 152).\n\nJohn Roe #2 and other Students who may have answered the disputed questions in\n\ntheir bar applications will soon be subject to an investigation they believe will\n\nviolate their rights under the ADA and Constitution. Those Students who have\n\nelected or will elect not to answer the questions risk denial of admission to the\n\nbar after expending considerable time and expense. This risk is more than\n\nhypothetical. The ACLU has already asked the Board to remove the disputed\n\nquestions. See Aplt. App. at 228-32 (correspondence between ACLU and Board).\n\nThe Board modified two of the questions, id. at 234-35, but declined to further\n\nalter the questions to the ACLU’s liking. Id. at 244. Therefore, were we to delay\n\nreview until the Students pass the bar exam and challenge the questions before the\n\nBoard and Colorado Supreme Court, we would in effect require the Students “to\n\njump through a series of hoops, the last of which [they are] certain to find\n\nobstructed by a brick wall.” Triple G Landfills, Inc. v. Bd. of Comm’rs of\n\nFountain County, Indiana, 977 F.2d 287, 291 (7th Cir. 1992). All the while, the\n\nStudents’ legal careers will be placed on hold.\n\n      The Board asserts that it will not review the Students’ answers to the\n\ndisputed questions and commence related investigations until the Students\n\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fgraduate and pass the bar exam. See Aplt. App. 87C-D, ¶10 (affidavit of Mr.\n\nOgden). Accordingly, the Board argues that the Students’ action is not yet ripe\n\nsince none of the Students have graduated or passed the bar exam. The Board\n\nrelies primarily upon the Supreme Court’s decision in Reno v. Catholic Soc.\n\nServices, Inc., 509 U.S. 43 (1993). Reno, however, is factually distinguishable\n\nfrom this case.\n\n      In Reno, the Supreme Court held that a challenge to INS temporary resident\n\nstatus regulations by aliens who had not been “front-desked” 4 was not yet ripe.\n\nId. at 59-65. The court reached this conclusion because it was unclear whether\n\nany of the aliens were willing to apply for temporary resident status and whether\n\nthe aliens would satisfy other conditions necessary to obtain such status. Id. at 59\n\nn.20. The aliens’ “claim[s] would ripen only once [they] took the affirmative\n\nsteps that [they] could take before the INS blocked [their] path by applying the\n\nregulation to [them].” Id. at 59. We are not faced with such uncertainties in this\n\ncase. The Students are on a collision course with the disputed questions and a\n\nBoard investigation. They have or will have invested three years of their life and\n\nuntold resources into their legal education. John Roe #2 graduated in May, and\n\nhe and other Students have applied for admission to the bar and will take the\n\n\n      4\n         The term refers to those aliens whose applications were rejected by\nLegalization Assistants because the applicant was deemed to be statutorily\nineligible. Id. at 61-62.\n\n                                       - 13 -\n\fexam in July. As with standing, the fact that the Students have not yet passed the\n\nbar exam does not defeat ripeness. While “[t]here is always the chance” that the\n\nStudents will not graduate or fail the exam, “that contingency, in and of itself, is\n\nnot sufficient to defeat ripeness.” Triple G Landfills, 977 F.2d at 291. This is\n\nparticularly true “in light of the substantial practical effect” the questions and\n\ninvestigation have on the Students’ long-term plans. Id. at 291.\n\n      The final two factors warrant only brief discussion. There are no pending\n\nBoard administrative actions concerning the legality of the questions and related\n\nBoard investigation. Furthermore, we will not benefit from further factual\n\ndevelopment because the Students’ action is a facial challenge. A “determination\n\nof the merits turns upon strictly legal issues” and does not “require[] facts that\n\nmay not yet be sufficiently developed.” New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v.\n\nGonzales, 64 F.3d 1495, 1499 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nC.    Abstention\n\n      Although no state action was pending, the district court concluded that it\n\nshould abstain from adjudicating the Students’ action because state action was\n\nimminent and the Colorado Supreme Court should have the opportunity to address\n\nthe Students’ challenge to the disputed questions: “[T]he Colorado Supreme\n\nCourt must grant or deny each application for Bar admission and there is no\n\nimpediment to an applicant’s urging that court to grant admission despite a failure\n\n\n                                         - 14 -\n\fto answer the contested questions or to supply the information sought to be\n\nprotected.” Aplt. App. at 255. This decision to abstain, under Younger v. Harris,\n\n401 U.S. 37 (1971), and its progeny, was in error.\n\n      We review the district court’s decision to abstain de novo. Taylor v.\n\nJaquez, 126 F.3d 1294, 1296 (10th Cir. 1997). Abstention “is the exception, not\n\nthe rule.” Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 705 (1992) (citation and\n\ninternal quotations omitted). It should be “rarely . . . invoked, because the federal\n\ncourts have a virtually unflagging obligation . . . to exercise the jurisdiction given\n\nthem.” Id. (citation and internal quotations omitted). Younger abstention is\n\nappropriate only if (1) a party asserts federal claims that have been or could be\n\npresented in ongoing state proceedings, (2) the state proceedings implicate\n\nimportant state interests, and (3) the state proceedings afford an adequate\n\nopportunity to raise federal claims. J.B. ex. rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280,\n\n1291 (10th Cir. 1999). In all other cases, Younger abstention is not appropriate.\n\nAnkenbrandt, 504 U.S. at 705; see also J.B. ex. rel. Hart, 186 F.3d at 1291 (“A\n\ncase warrants Younger abstention only if each of these three criteria are\n\nsatisfied.”). In fact, in 1992, the Supreme Court noted that it had “never applied\n\nthe notions of comity so critical to Younger’s “Our Federalism” when no state\n\nproceeding was pending . . . .” Ankenbrandt, 504 U.S. at 705. This remains true\n\ntoday. Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 12 n.9 (1987), upon which the\n\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\fBoard heavily relies, is not to the contrary. Any suggestion in Pennzoil that a\n\npending state proceeding was not a prerequisite to Younger abstention was put to\n\nrest in Ankenbrandt, 504 U.S. at 705.\n\nD.      Sovereign Immunity\n\n        The district court construed the Students’ action as brought “against the\n\nColorado Supreme Court.” Aplt. App. at 247. The court explained: “Th[e] tactic\n\n[of dismissing the Colorado Supreme Court and Colorado State Board of Law\n\nexaminers] does not change the nature of this case. Claims made against persons\n\nin their official capacities are claims against the entities authorizing their\n\nactions.” Id. Nevertheless, the district court passed on the question of whether\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment barred the Students’ action. The Board asserts on\n\nappeal that the Eleventh Amendment does in fact bar this action. We address the\n\nissue of sovereign immunity, as we may affirm the district court for any reason\n\nthat is adequately supported by the record, Weitzel v. Div. of Occupational and\n\nProf’l Licensing of Dep’t of Commerce of Utah, 240 F.3d 871, 876 (10th Cir.\n\n2001), and the issue concerns our jurisdiction. J.B. ex. rel. Hart, 186 F.3d at\n\n1285.\n\n        An individual may bring an ADA or § 1983 action against a state official in\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 16 -\n\ffederal court for injunctive relief under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). 5\n\nJ.B. ex. rel. Hart, 186 F.3d at 1287; Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 677 (1974)\n\n(§ 1983); Will v. Michigan Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 n.10 (1989)\n\n(“Of course a state official in his or her official capacity, when sued for\n\ninjunctive relief, would be a person under § 1983 because ‘official-capacity\n\nactions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State.’”\n\n(quoting Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167 n.14 (1985)). “Under the Ex\n\nparte Young doctrine, the Eleventh Amendment generally does not bar a suit\n\nagainst a state official in federal court which seeks only prospective equitable\n\nrelief for violations of federal law, even if the state is immune.” J.B. ex. rel.\n\nHart, 186 F.3d at 1286 (citation and internal quotations omitted). The Students’\n\naction therefore falls squarely within the Ex parte Young exception to Colorado’s\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n      The Board raises two arguments against application of Ex parte Young,\n\nneither of which is availing. First, the Board argues that the Ex parte Young\n\nexception is unavailable in this case because the Students seek an injunction\n\nagainst the Colorado Supreme Court. Ex parte Young prohibits a federal court\n\nonly from enjoining “a court from acting in any case brought before it . . . .” 209\n\n\n      5\n        Because the Supreme Court has issued its decision in Board of Trustees\nof the University of Alabama v. Garrett,121 S.Ct. 955, 968 n.9 (2001), the\nBoard’s request that this case be held in abeyance pending Garrett is moot.\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\fU.S. at 163. The Students do not seek to enjoin the Colorado Supreme Court\n\nfrom acting in a pending case. Moreover, the Students may bring a general\n\nchallenge to bar admission rules promulgated by the Colorado Supreme Court.\n\nSee District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 482-83\n\n(1983); Johnson v. Rodrigues (Orozco), 226 F.3d 1103, 1108 (10th Cir. 2000).\n\nSecond, the Board argues that the Students’ action is barred under the narrow\n\nexception to Ex parte Young set forth in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho,\n\n521 U.S. 261 (1997). This exception is inapplicable here because the Students\n\nseek only injunctive relief. J.B. ex. rel. Hart, 186 F.3d at 1286 (holding that\n\nCoeur d’Alene exception to Ex parte Young applies only if the plaintiffs’ action\n\n“implicates special sovereignty interests” and the relief sought “is the functional\n\nequivalent to a form of legal relief against the state that would otherwise be\n\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment” (citation and internal quotations omitted)).\n\n\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s order is reversed. The\n\nStudents’ action should proceed to the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\f",

Certain Imperial Valley residents\n\nsought to intervene and appeal the decision. Id. at 366. They asserted standing\n\non the basis that they desired to purchase farmland in Imperial Valley that might\n\nbecome available if the acre limitation was held to be applicable. Id. However,\n\nthe residents “could not with certainty establish that they would be able to\n\npurchase excess lands if [the provision] were held applicable.” Id. at 367. It was\n\nuncertain whether owners of excess land would sell, whether the residents had\n\nsufficient financial resources to purchase the land, and whether the residents\n\nwould be outbid by other potential purchasers. Id. at 367 & n.17. These\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\funcertainties notwithstanding, the residents had standing because it was likely\n\nthat the residents would purchase the excess lands if the acre limitation was\n\napplicable. Id. at 368. The facts in this case are far more compelling. Having\n\ninvested three years of time and resources to complete law school, John Roe #2\n\nwill sit for the bar exam.

Id. at 894 (quoting Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 152).\n\nJohn Roe #2 and other Students who may have answered the disputed questions in\n\ntheir bar applications will soon be subject to an investigation they believe will\n\nviolate their rights under the ADA and Constitution. Those Students who have\n\nelected or will elect not to answer the questions risk denial of admission to the\n\nbar after expending considerable time and expense. This risk is more than\n\nhypothetical. The ACLU has already asked the Board to remove the disputed\n\nquestions. See Aplt. App. at 228-32 (correspondence between ACLU and Board).\n\nThe Board modified two of the questions, id. at 234-35, but declined to further\n\nalter the questions to the ACLU’s liking. Id. at 244. Therefore, were we to delay\n\nreview until the Students pass the bar exam and challenge the questions before the\n\nBoard and Colorado Supreme Court, we would in effect require the Students “to\n\njump through a series of hoops, the last of which [they are] certain to find\n\nobstructed by a brick wall.” Triple G Landfills, Inc. v.

All the while, the\n\nStudents’ legal careers will be placed on hold.\n\n      The Board asserts that it will not review the Students’ answers to the\n\ndisputed questions and commence related investigations until the Students\n\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fgraduate and pass the bar exam. See Aplt. App. 87C-D, ¶10 (affidavit of Mr.\n\nOgden). Accordingly, the Board argues that the Students’ action is not yet ripe\n\nsince none of the Students have graduated or passed the bar exam. The Board\n\nrelies primarily upon the Supreme Court’s decision in Reno v. Catholic Soc.\n\nServices, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112889\"><a href=\"/opinion/112889/reno-v-catholic-social-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). Reno, however, is factually distinguishable\n\nfrom this case.\n\n      In Reno, the Supreme Court held that a challenge to INS temporary resident\n\nstatus regulations by aliens who had not been “front-desked” 4 was not yet ripe.\n\nId. at 59-65. The court reached this conclusion because it was unclear whether\n\nany of the aliens were willing to apply for temporary resident status and whether\n\nthe aliens would satisfy other conditions necessary to obtain such status. Id. at 59\n\nn.20. The aliens’ “claim[s] would ripen only once [they] took the affirmative\n\nsteps that [they] could take before the INS blocked [their] path by applying the\n\nregulation to [them].” Id. at 59. We are not faced with such uncertainties in this\n\ncase. The Students are on a collision course with the disputed questions and a\n\nBoard investigation. They have or will have invested three years of their life and\n\nuntold resources into their legal education. John Roe #2 graduated in May, and\n\nhe and other Students have applied for admission to the bar and will take the\n\n\n      4\n         The term refers to those aliens whose applications were rejected by\nLegalization Assistants because the applicant was deemed to be statutorily\nineligible.

While “[t]here is always the chance” that the\n\nStudents will not graduate or fail the exam, “that contingency, in and of itself, is\n\nnot sufficient to defeat ripeness.” Triple G Landfills, 977 F.2d at 291. This is\n\nparticularly true “in light of the substantial practical effect” the questions and\n\ninvestigation have on the Students’ long-term plans. Id. at 291.\n\n      The final two factors warrant only brief discussion. There are no pending\n\nBoard administrative actions concerning the legality of the questions and related\n\nBoard investigation. Furthermore, we will not benefit from further factual\n\ndevelopment because the Students’ action is a facial challenge. A “determination\n\nof the merits turns upon strictly legal issues” and does not “require[] facts that\n\nmay not yet be sufficiently developed.” New Mexicans for Bill Richardson v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1499 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nC.    Abstention\n\n      Although no state action was pending, the district court concluded that it\n\nshould abstain from adjudicating the Students’ action because state action was\n\nimminent and the Colorado Supreme Court should have the opportunity to address\n\nthe Students’ challenge to the disputed questions: “[T]he Colorado Supreme\n\nCourt must grant or deny each application for Bar admission and there is no\n\nimpediment to an applicant’s urging that court to grant admission despite a failure\n\n\n                                         - 14 -\n\fto answer the contested questions or to supply the information sought to be\n\nprotected.” Aplt.

Younger abstention is\n\nappropriate only if (1) a party asserts federal claims that have been or could be\n\npresented in ongoing state proceedings, (2) the state proceedings implicate\n\nimportant state interests, and (3) the state proceedings afford an adequate\n\nopportunity to raise federal claims.

Sovereign Immunity\n\n        The district court construed the Students’ action as brought “against the\n\nColorado Supreme Court.” Aplt. App. at 247. The court explained: “Th[e] tactic\n\n[of dismissing the Colorado Supreme Court and Colorado State Board of Law\n\nexaminers] does not change the nature of this case. Claims made against persons\n\nin their official capacities are claims against the entities authorizing their\n\nactions.” Id. Nevertheless, the district court passed on the question of whether\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment barred the Students’ action.

First, the Board argues that the Ex parte Young\n\nexception is unavailable in this case because the Students seek an injunction\n\nagainst the Colorado Supreme Court.

The Students do not seek to enjoin the Colorado Supreme Court\n\nfrom acting in a pending case.
