D-1-GN-05-003010, HONORABLE GUS J. STRAUSS, JR., JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               This is the second appeal in this suit filed by appellant Carolyn Barnes, plaintiff in the\n\nunderlying proceeding, against appellees University Federal Credit Union (UFCU) and Government\n\nEmployees Insurance Company (GEICO). In our prior opinion, we affirmed the trial court’s severance\n\norder and partial summary judgment in favor of UFCU and GEICO. Barnes’s remaining claims and\n\nUFCU’s counterclaims proceeded to a jury trial. Barnes appeals from a final judgment, consistent\n\nwith the jury’s findings, denying her breach of contract and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA)\n\nclaims and awarding UFCU damages and attorneys’ fees. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm\n\nthe judgment conditioned on UFCU filing a remittitur reducing its award of attorneys’ fees for this\n\nappeal to $15,000.\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               The factual and procedural background of this case is fully set forth in our prior\n\nopinion. See Barnes v. University Fed. Credit Union, No. 03-09-00003-CV, 2010 WL 2133946\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin May 27, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.). Generally stated, however, Barnes obtained\n\ntwo loans from UFCU for $14,066 using two personal vehicles as collateral. The loan agreements\n\nrequired Barnes to obtain comprehensive and collision insurance coverage. After sending Barnes\n\nnumerous letters requesting a copy of the required insurance and not receiving the requested proof,\n\nUFCU issued collateral protection insurance (CPI) and added the $1,600 premium to the loan\n\nbalance. On August 25, 2005, Barnes filed suit against UFCU and GEICO, her insurance carrier,\n\npleading numerous causes of action, including breach of contract against UFCU and DTPA claims\n\nagainst GEICO—alleging that GEICO had misled her regarding the scope of her coverage.\n\n               On April 5, 2006, UFCU sent Barnes a settlement proposal stating that in return for\n\n$8,000, UFCU would consider the relevant loans to be paid in full, release the liens on her vehicles,\n\nand forego collection of any late fees, penalties, interest, or attorneys’ fees. The proposal further\n\nstates, “UFCU and Barnes will execute reasonable and mutually agreeable full releases and other\n\nsettlement documentation necessary to fully resolve and dismiss the current proceedings.” The letter\n\ncontained a signature line for Barnes to sign acknowledging that she “agreed and accepted” the\n\nagreement. Barnes did not sign. Rather, she sent UFCU a cashier’s check for $8,000 accompanied\n\nby a letter dated April 11, 2006, stating, “I am in receipt of your extortion demand with threats of\n\nadditional economic and financial terrorism if I do not comply with your demands. This ransom and\n\nextortion money is being paid under extreme economic and financial duress and not because it is due\n\nand owing.” The letter goes on to state that the funds were being tendered “with all rights reserved”\n\n                                                 2\n\fand asserting claims of over $400,000 against UFCU in damages and attorneys’ fees. UFCU sent\n\nnotice that it would not accept Barnes’s check unless she signed a release of all claims. Barnes did\n\nnot sign a release, and UFCU declined to negotiate the $8,000 check. Barnes filed UFCU’s letter\n\nwith the trial court as a Rule 11 agreement and amended her pleadings to add an additional breach\n\nof contract claim against UFCU, alleging that UFCU had breached the parties’ Rule 11 agreement\n\nby proceeding with litigation after receiving her cashier’s check for $8,000.\n\n               Eventually, all parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of UFCU and GEICO on all of Barnes’s claims except for her two breach of\n\ncontract claims against UFCU—one claim arising from the loan agreement and the other from\n\nthe alleged Rule 11 agreement—and her DTPA claims against GEICO. Prior to GEICO’s filing a\n\nmotion to sever the causes of action that had been decided on summary judgment, Barnes filed\n\nsupplemental pleadings adding new causes of action, including claims for breach of fiduciary duty\n\nand breach of fair debt collection laws against UFCU (“supplemental claims”). The trial court\n\nentered an order of severance, severing out those causes of action that had already been decided and\n\nordering Barnes to proceed only with her two breach of contract claims against UFCU and her DTPA\n\nclaims against GEICO. On appeal, we affirmed the summary judgment and order of severance.\n\n               Barnes’s remaining claims, as well as UFCU’s counterclaims, proceeded to a jury\n\ntrial. In addition, the trial court allowed her to proceed with her supplemental fair debt collection\n\nclaim against UFCU. The jury found that Barnes breached her loan agreements with UFCU, UFCU\n\ndid not breach the loan agreements, and Barnes’s breach was unexcused by her affirmative defenses.\n\nThe jury awarded UFCU damages of $11,022.33 and attorneys’ fees of $35,000 for preparation and\n\ntrial, $25,000 for an appeal to the court of appeals, and $15,000 for an appeal to the Supreme Court\n\n                                                 3\n\fof Texas. The jury further found against Barnes on her breach of contract claim arising from the\n\nalleged Rule 11 agreement, finding that the parties had not entered into an enforceable settlement\n\nagreement and against her DTPA claims against GEICO. But the jury did find in favor of Barnes\n\non her fair debt collection claim against UFCU and awarded her $1,049.96 in damages and $35,000\n\nin attorneys’ fees.1 The trial court entered final judgment in accordance with the jury’s findings.\n\n               In five issues on appeal, Barnes argues the trial court erred by: (1) improperly severing\n\nher supplemental claims and not submitting jury questions for those claims, (2) not enforcing the\n\nalleged Rule 11 agreement as a matter of law, (3) assessing discovery sanctions against her in the\n\namount of $500, (4) granting summary judgment in favor of GEICO and UFCU, and (5) depriving\n\nher of her right to a fair trial due to numerous complaints, including improper jury argument, improper\n\ncomment on the evidence, violation of the motion in limine, discovery abuse, and insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s findings.\n\n\n                                    ORDER OF SEVERANCE\n\n               In her first issue on appeal, Barnes argues the trial court erred by (1) improperly\n\nsevering her supplemental claims and (2) refusing to submit those claims to the jury. UFCU contends\n\nthat this Court has already determined and rejected Barnes’s argument in her prior appeal, and even\n\nif we choose to revisit the issue, Barnes failed to preserve error by requesting jury questions for her\n\nsupplemental claims. We agree with UFCU that we already addressed the propriety of the severance\n\norder in our prior opinion. With regard to the jury charge, we conclude the trial court submitted all\n\ngrounds of recovery supported by the evidence and properly requested by counsel.\n\n\n       1\n        UFCU does not appeal the jury’s finding on Barnes’s fair debt collection claim or the award\nof damages and attorneys’ fees.\n\n                                                  4\n\f               In her prior appeal before this Court, Barnes argued that the trial court’s severance\n\norder improperly severed her supplemental claims. We concluded that, even if the order improperly\n\nsevered claims that had not been resolved on summary judgment, the issue was remedied because\n\nthe trial court permitted Barnes to proceed at trial on claims that were raised for the first time after\n\nthe summary judgment order. Indeed, Barnes obtained a favorable jury verdict on her supplemental\n\nfair debt collection claim. “Under the law of the case doctrine, a court of appeals is ordinarily bound\n\nby its initial decision if there is a subsequent appeal in the same case.” Briscoe v. Goodmark Corp.,\n\n102 S.W.3d 714, 716-17 (Tex. 2003). Barnes has not presented new facts, legal analysis, or\n\nargument that would change the disposition of this issue. Accordingly, the law of the case doctrine\n\nbars its reconsideration.\n\n               With regard to the trial court’s submission of Barnes’s supplemental claims to the\n\njury, the trial court did submit—as previously noted—a jury question on Barnes’s supplemental fair\n\ndebt collection claim. For Barnes’s remaining supplemental claims, she only requested and obtained\n\na ruling on her supplemental claim for breach of fiduciary duty against UFCU. Trial courts are\n\nrequired “to submit requested questions to the jury if the pleadings and any evidence support them.”\n\nElbaor v. Smith, 845 S.W.2d 240, 243 (Tex. 1992); see also Tex. R. Civ. P. 278. But a fiduciary\n\nrelationship does not usually exist between a borrower and lender, and we cannot conclude\n\nthe evidence supported a claim against UFCU for breach of fiduciary duty. See Thigpen v. Locke,\n\n363 S.W.2d 247, 253 (Tex. 1963) (debtor-creditor relationship alone insufficient to create fiduciary\n\nrelationship); see also Bank One, Texas, N.A. v. Stewart, 967 S.W.2d 419, 442 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1998, pet. denied).\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f                When Texas courts have found a fiduciary relationship between a borrower and\n\ncreditor, “the findings have rested on extraneous facts and conduct, such as excessive lender control\n\nor influence in the borrower’s business activities.” Bank One, Texas, N.A., 967 S.W.2d at 442. Upon\n\nreview of the record, we cannot find—nor does Barnes identify in her brief—evidence of extraneous\n\nfacts or conduct by UFCU creating a fiduciary relationship. Further, because Barnes had never done\n\nbusiness at UFCU before, there is no evidence of a long-standing relationship of trust that might\n\ncreate a fiduciary relationship. See Thigpen, 363 S.W.2d at 253; Fleming v. Texas Coastal Bank of\n\nPasadena, 67 S.W.3d 459, 461 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied). As there was\n\nnot sufficient evidence to support a breach of fiduciary duty claim, we conclude the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by omitting the requested ground of recovery from the jury charge.\n\n                We further conclude that Barnes has waived error as to all other supplemental claims.\n\nDuring a discussion of the supplemental claims at pretrial conference, Barnes’s counsel expressly\n\nadvised the trial court that the only supplemental claim her client would pursue at trial was the fair\n\ndebt collection claim based on UFCU improperly reporting Barnes’s debt: “I’m just submitting a\n\njury issue about the unfair debt reporting.” At the charge conference, Barnes’s counsel additionally\n\nsought a jury question on the breach of fiduciary duty claim. But Barnes did not timely request in\n\nwriting a jury question for any other supplemental claim.2 See Tex. R. Civ. P. 278. Further, Barnes’s\n\n\n       2\n          The record reflects Barnes filed proposed jury questions for some supplemental claims a\nmonth after the jury returned its verdict but did not obtain a ruling on these untimely requests. See\nTex. R. Civ. P. 278 (“Failure to submit a question shall not be deemed a ground for reversal of the\njudgment, unless its submission, in substantially correct wording, has been requested in writing and\ntendered by the party complaining of the judgment . . . .”); Moffett v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,\n652 S.W.2d 609, 612 (Tex. App.—Austin 1983, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (without indication in record that\nrequested jury question was presented and refused by trial court no error is preserved despite requested\nissues inclusion in record).\n\n                                                   6\n\fbrief does not contain a clear argument as to how she established any other supplemental claim\n\nor appropriate citations to legal authority and the record to support such claims. See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 38.1(I). On appeal, all independent grounds of recovery “not conclusively established under the\n\nevidence and no element of which is submitted or requested are waived.” Tex. R. Civ. P. 279.\n\nBecause Barnes failed to request jury questions on any other supplemental claims and has not\n\nconclusively established those claims under the evidence, we conclude she has waived error.\n\n\n                             ALLEGED RULE 11 AGREEMENT\n\n               Barnes also argues the trial court erred in denying her motions for directed verdict,\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict, and new trial because she established as a matter of law:\n\n(1) her breach of contract claim against UFCU arising from the alleged Rule 11 agreement, or in the\n\nalternative, (2) her affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction to UFCU’s breach of contract\n\nclaim arising from the loan agreement.3 Barnes’s argument is twofold: first, she argues her $8,000\n\ncashier’s check and accompanying letter, tendered in response to UFCU’s settlement proposal,\n\nconstituted a valid acceptance of UFCU’s offer creating an enforceable settlement agreement.4\n\n       3\n         Barnes also argues on appeal that the trial court erred by denying her three motions for\nsummary judgment seeking enforcement of the alleged Rule 11 agreement. Where a motion for\nsummary judgment is denied by the trial court and tried on its merits, the order denying the motion\nfor summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal. Ackermann v. Vordenbaum, 403 S.W.2d 362,\n365 (Tex. 1966); Nuby v. Allied Bankers Life Ins. Co., 797 S.W.2d 396, 397 (Tex. App.—Austin\n1990, no writ).\n       4\n          Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11 requires all agreements between parties touching any\npending suit to be in writing, signed, and filed as part of the record. With her summary judgment\nmotion seeking enforcement of the alleged Rule 11 agreement, Barnes attached UFCU’s settlement\nproposal letter signed by an attorney for UFCU, her signed responding letter, and a copy of the\n$8,000 cashier’s check signed by a representative of the issuing bank. A series of letters between\nparties may constitute a written settlement agreement enforceable under Rule 11. Padilla v. LaFrance,\n907 S.W.2d 454, 460 (Tex. 1995).\n\n                                                 7\n\fThe jury disagreed, finding that Barnes and UFCU did not enter into an enforceable settlement\n\nagreement. In the alternative, Barnes argues she established the affirmative defense of accord and\n\nsatisfaction to UFCU’s breach of contract claim arising from the loan agreement. Specifically, she\n\nargues her tender of the $8,000 cashier’s check and accompanying letter constituted a new agreement\n\nbetween the parties that should operate as an accord and satisfaction, thereby discharging her\n\nobligations under the original loan contract. The jury again disagreed, finding Barnes breached the loan\n\nagreement and did not meet her burden of proof for the affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction.\n\n\n                                         Standard of Review\n\n                The substance of Barnes’s argument is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the\n\njury’s findings.5 See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 823 (Tex. 2005). Barnes had the\n\nburden of proof both on her breach of contract claim against UFCU arising from the alleged Rule 11\n\nagreement and on her affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction. When a party attacks the legal\n\nsufficiency of an adverse finding on an issue on which she has the burden of proof, she must\n\n\n       5\n          Barnes also challenges the factual sufficiency of the jury’s findings but failed to preserve\nerror in her motion for new trial by adequately apprising the trial court of the alleged deficiency. See\nTex. R. Civ. P. 324(b). A point in a motion for new trial is a prerequisite to complain on appeal that\nthe evidence is factually insufficient to support a jury finding. Id. Embedded within a point in her\nmotion for new trial discussing deliberations and titled “Jury Misconduct,” Barnes generally alleges\nthat she established as a matter of law an accord and satisfaction “and, in any event, any opposite\nfindings would be contrary to the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.” In over thirty-\nfive pages of argument, Barnes provides no further support, authority, or evidence to apprise the\ntrial court that she was challenging the factual sufficiency of any jury findings. We conclude that\nBarnes’s argument did not clearly identify that she was challenging the factual sufficiency of the\njury’s findings, nor was she specific enough to give the trial court proper notice of the matter at\nissue; she has thus failed to preserve error. Tex. R. Civ. P. 321 (each point relied upon in motion\nfor new trial shall refer to complained of error in such a way that objection can be clearly identified\nand understood by the court).\n\n                                                   8\n\fdemonstrate on appeal that the evidence establishes, as a matter of law, all vital facts in support of\n\nthe issue. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 241-42 (Tex. 2001); Sterner v. Marathon Oil\n\nCo., 767 S.W.2d 686, 690 (Tex. 1989). A party attempting to overcome an adverse fact finding as\n\na matter of law must surmount two hurdles. Sterner, 767 S.W.2d at 690. First, the record must be\n\nexamined for evidence that supports the jury’s finding, while ignoring all evidence to the contrary. Id.\n\nSecond, if there is no evidence to support the fact finder’s answer, then the entire record must be\n\nexamined to see if the contrary proposition is established as a matter of law. Id. The point of error\n\nwill be sustained only if the contrary proposition is conclusively established. Dow Chemical Co.,\n\n46 S.W.3d at 241.\n\n\n                                        Settlement Agreement\n\n                Reviewing the evidence supporting the jury’s finding that the parties did not enter\n\nan enforceable settlement agreement, we conclude Barnes did not establish as a matter of law the\n\nexistence of a valid settlement agreement with UFCU. A settlement is a contract, and its construction\n\nis governed by legal principles applicable to contracts generally. Rodriguez v. Villarreal, 314 S.W.3d\n\n636, 641 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.). Like all contracts, a settlement requires\n\nan offer, an acceptance, and a meeting of the minds. See Killeen v. Lighthouse Elec. Contractors,\n\n248 S.W.3d 343, 349 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2007, pet. denied).\n\n                UFCU’s letter to Barnes dated April 5, 2006 proposed settlement under the following\n\nterms: (1) Barnes would pay UFCU $8,000 via cashier’s check or other certified funds before\n\nApril 13, 2006; (2) upon receipt of the settlement amount, UFCU would release the liens it possessed\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fon Barnes’s vehicles; (3) all parties would pay their own court costs, interest, attorney’s fees and\n\nother costs; (4) UFCU would consider the loans paid in full; and (4) UFCU and Barnes would\n\nexecute reasonable and mutually agreeable full releases and other settlement documentation\n\nnecessary to fully resolve and dismiss the current proceedings.\n\n                 While Barnes contends that she consented to the proposed settlement agreement by\n\nproviding UFCU with a cashier’s check in the proposed settlement amount, Barnes failed to sign the\n\nsettlement proposal acknowledging that she “agreed and accepted” the settlement terms. Moreover,\n\nthe cashier’s check was sent with an accompanying letter stating that it was tendered “under extreme\n\neconomic duress, under protest, and with all rights reserved” and asserting claims of over $400,000\n\nagainst UFCU in damages and attorneys’ fees. We conclude this is some evidence that Barnes did\n\nnot accept UFCU’s proposal to fully settle the dispute and resolve the pending proceedings. United\n\nConcrete Pipe Corp. v. Spin-Line Co., 430 S.W.2d 360, 364 (Tex. 1968) (well settled that if an\n\nacceptance changes or qualifies the terms of the offer, the offer is rejected); see also King v. Bishop,\n\n879 S.W.2d 222, 223-24 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ) (economic duress may\n\nbe grounds to set aside a settlement agreement). As such, our inquiry with regard to this issue need\n\ngo no further.\n\n\n                                       Accord and Satisfaction\n\n                 We further conclude that Barnes did not establish as a matter of law her affirmative\n\ndefense of accord and satisfaction. An accord and satisfaction exists when parties agree to discharge\n\nan existing obligation in a manner other than in accordance with the terms of their original\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fcontract. Jenkins v. Henry C. Beck Co., 449 S.W.2d 454, 455 (Tex. 1969). The doctrine of accord\n\nand satisfaction is based upon the creation of a new contract, express or implied, by which the parties\n\nspecifically and intentionally agree to the discharge of one of the parties’ existing obligations in\n\na manner otherwise than originally agreed. Id.; Pate v. McClain, 769 S.W.2d 356, 361-62 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Beaumont 1989, writ denied).\n\n               To prevail on appeal, Barnes must demonstrate that the evidence establishes as a\n\nmatter of law: (1) she in good faith tendered the cashier’s check to UFCU as full satisfaction of the\n\nclaim, (2) the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute, (3) UFCU\n\nobtained payment of the instrument, and (4) the check or an accompanying written communication\n\ncontained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction\n\nof the claim. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 3.311(a) & (b) (West 2002 & Supp. 2012) (Texas\n\nUniform Commercial Code provision governing accord and satisfaction by use of negotiable\n\ninstrument).6 If these elements are proven, the claim is discharged, subject to two exceptions\n\ninapplicable to this case. See id. § 3.311(b) & (c).\n\n               We cannot conclude that Barnes established as a matter of law that UFCU obtained\n\npayment of the cashier’s check. Reviewing the evidence in support of the jury’s verdict, UFCU\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          The cashier’s check at issue is a negotiable instrument to which the Texas Uniform\nCommercial Code (“Code”) applies. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 3.104(a) (West 2002 &\nSupp. 2012). Because Section 3.311 of the Code—governing accord and satisfaction by use of a\nnegotiable instrument—does not conflict with the common law doctrine of accord and satisfaction,\nwe may use common law principles of accord and satisfaction to supplement the Code’s provisions.\nSee Milton M. Cooke Co. v. First Bank and Trust, 290 S.W.3d 297, 304 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.); Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 1.103(b) (West 2009 & Supp. 2012).\n\n                                                  11\n\fretained but declined to negotiate the check for approximately six months until Barnes obtained a\n\nrefund from the issuing bank.7 Upon receipt of the check, UFCU immediately mailed Barnes a letter\n\nstating UFCU “cannot accept/negotiate your check or proceed” until all of the settlement terms\n\nare agreed to, including agreement to execute a full release “allowing this matter to be fully and\n\ncompletely resolved.” Barnes never signed the settlement proposal or a release. During the six months\n\nUFCU retained the check, it sent Barnes three more letters urging her to assent to the terms of the\n\nsettlement agreement—to no avail.8 Barnes admitted at trial that she never asked UFCU to return\n\nthe check.\n\n               Our sister courts have found that the retention of a cashier’s check for an\n\nunreasonable length of time is the equivalent of an acceptance of the accord and satisfaction as\n\na matter of law. See Tarrant Wholesale Drug Co. v. Kendall, 223 S.W.2d 964, 966-67 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 1949, no writ) (“[F]ailure to return a [cashier’s] check tendered in settlement\n\nof a disputed claim within a reasonable time, must be regarded in law as an acceptance of the\n\ncompromise offer.”); Willis v. City Nat’l Bank of Galveston, 280 S.W. 270, 273 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Galveston 1926, writ ref’d) (holding long-continued retention of cashier’s check “without\n\n       7\n          The date of the refund is not revealed by the record, but the parties agree UFCU retained\nthe check for at least six months. Barnes testified that she obtained a refund by filling out a lost\ncashier’s check form with the issuing bank.\n       8\n          The UFCU letters responding to Barnes’s tender are dated April 14, 2006; April 18, 2006;\nJune 13, 2006; and July 7, 2006. Barnes complains on appeal the trial court committed fundamental\nerror by admitting the letters into evidence, which she describes as “self-serving post-breach legal\nopinions and completely irrelevant as to the formation of the contract.” As the letters were relevant\nto proving or disproving the existence of a settlement agreement and Barnes’s breach of contract\nclaim, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fin any way indicating its refusal to accept the terms of the settlement” constituted acceptance of\n\naccord and satisfaction as a matter of law). But what is an unreasonable amount of time to retain a\n\ncheck depends on the circumstances of the case. See Curran v. Bray Wood Heel Co., Inc., 68 A.2d\n\n712, 718 (Vt. 1949) (“The cases recognize that what is a reasonable time depends upon the\n\ncircumstances of each case.”); 35 Am. Jur.2d Proof of Facts § 735 (2013) (“Many courts have held\n\nthat a creditor’s retention for an unreasonable length of time of a check tendered in full payment\n\nof a debt, without cashing or making affirmative use of the check constitutes acceptance of the\n\ncheck. . . . The question whether a particular period of time is unreasonable depends on the\n\ncircumstances of the individual case.”).\n\n                We cannot conclude, based on the record before us, that UFCU’s retention of the\n\ncheck was for an unreasonable length of time as a matter of law when: (1) UFCU immediately\n\nrepudiated the offered accord, (2) UFCU informed Barnes it could not negotiate the check until a full\n\nsettlement could be reached, (3) Barnes acquiesced to UFCU’s retention of the check and did not\n\nrequest the check be returned, and (4) there were continued settlement negotiations between the\n\nparties. See Kelly v. Kowalsky, 442 A.2d 1355, 1357 (Conn. 1982) (“When creditor immediately\n\nand fully explains the grounds for his retention of a conditional check, and when a debtor acquiesces\n\nin that retention, there is no policy reason to support a finding that a creditor has agreed to an offer\n\nof accord which he has expressly rejected.”); American Nat’l Bank v. Bradford, 188 S.W.2d 971,\n\n978-79 (Tenn. App. 1945) (when “the parties continue to negotiate to reach an agreement to\n\ncompromise the claim, it can hardly be said that the offeree must at the same time elect to accept or\n\nrefuse the check, or that his holding it during such negotiations is unreasonable”). We hold that,\n\n                                                  13\n\funder the particular circumstances of this case, whether UFCU retained the check for an\n\nunreasonable length of time presented a fact issue for the jury, and the evidence before the jury\n\npermitted it to find that there was no basis upon which to base an accord and satisfaction. See 35\n\nAm. Jur.2d Proof of Facts § 735 (2013) (“The reasonableness of the period of retention is ordinarily\n\na question for the jury.”).\n\n                Even if we were to conclude that UFCU’s retention of the cashier’s check was an\n\nimplied acceptance, we cannot conclude that Barnes established as a matter of law that the check or\n\nher accompanying letter “contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was\n\ntendered in full satisfaction of the claim.” Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 3.311(b). At the time\n\nBarnes tendered the check, there were numerous claims and counterclaims9 between the parties and\n\nthere is no notation on the check as to what claims Barnes intended to settle by tendering the funds\n\nor that the payment was tendered in full satisfaction of any claim. Further, the letter accompanying\n\nthe check did not explicitly state in clear and unmistakable terms that it was in full satisfaction of\n\nany or all claims. Rather, Barnes tendered the funds with “all rights reserved” and stated that the\n\namount due should be offset by over $400,000 in damages and attorneys’ fees.\n\n                When the creditor’s assent to the creation of a new contract must be implied, as in\n\nthis case, “the facts proved must irresistibly point to such conclusion.” Jenkins, 449 S.W.2d at 455.\n\n\n\n\n        9\n          Barnes had pending claims against UFCU for fraud in the inducement, DTPA violations,\nbreach of contract, fraud, negligence, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion\nof privacy, malice, and unconscionable contract of adhesion. UFCU had multiple counterclaims\npending against Barnes, including breach of contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and\nconversion. Both parties sought to recover attorneys’ fees.\n\n                                                   14\n\fThere must be “an unmistakable communication to the creditor that tender of the lesser sum is\n\nupon the condition that acceptance will constitute satisfaction of the underlying obligation.” Id.\n\nThe “statement accompanying the tender of a sum less than the contract price must be so clear,\n\nfull and explicit that it is not susceptible of any other interpretation.” Id. “The condition that the\n\ntender is in full settlement must be brought home to the creditor.” Roylex, Inc. v. S & B Eng’rs, Inc.,\n\n592 S.W.2d 59, 60 (Tex. Civ. App.—Texarkana 1979, no writ).\n\n               We do not believe that Barnes’s letter accompanying the cashier’s check is so clear,\n\nfull, and explicit that it is not susceptible of any interpretation other than that it was in full\n\nsatisfaction of all pending claims. George Linskie Co. v. Miller-Picking Corp., 463 S.W.2d 170, 173\n\n(Tex. 1971) (holding no accord and satisfaction as a matter of law when debtor “did not make known\n\nin clear and unmistakable terms that the tender . . . would constitute full satisfaction of all pending\n\nclaims”). Barnes’s tender of the funds “with all rights reserved” while continuing to claim additional\n\ndamages is itself unclear as to what claims are settled by the accord, and the accord is susceptible\n\nto multiple interpretations as to what claims were discharged. See id.\n\n               At best, any inferences to be drawn from the letter presented issues of fact properly\n\nsubmitted to the jury. See Jenkins, 449 S.W.2d at 456 (holding whether payments by contractor to\n\nsubcontractor carried unequivocal notice that payments were tendered in full satisfaction of all\n\nclaims was question of fact when numerous amounts were disputed and alleged accord was\n\nsusceptible to multiple interpretations); Flowers v. Diamond Shamrock Corp., 693 F.2d 1146, 1153\n\n(5th Cir. 1982) (“At most, any inferences to be drawn from the letter concerning . . . an accord\n\nand satisfaction, were factual issues to be determined by the jury.”); see also George Linskie Co.,\n\n                                                  15\n\f463 S.W.2d at 172 (holding no accord and satisfaction as a matter of law when letter accompanying\n\ntender was susceptible of multiple interpretations); Call of Houston, Inc. v. Mulvey, 343 S.W.2d 522,\n\n525 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston 1961, no writ) (holding whether parties mutually intended to enter\n\naccord and satisfaction presented issue of fact when recital on check could have been misunderstood\n\nby creditor). Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude that Barnes established her affirmative\n\ndefense of accord and satisfaction as a matter of law.10 We therefore overrule Barnes’s second issue\n\non appeal.\n\n\n                                   DISCOVERY SANCTIONS\n\n                In her third issue, Barnes complains the trial court abused its discretion in sanctioning\n\nher $500 in a discovery order dated July 5, 2006. The record reflects the trial court issued three\n\ndiscovery orders against Barnes. The first order, entered on December 13, 2005 and not challenged\n\non appeal, granted UFCU’s motion to compel and ordered Barnes to respond to UFCU’s\n\ndiscovery requests and pay $1,500 in attorneys’ fees as sanctions. The trial court issued a second\n\norder on June 12, 2006, granting UFCU’s second motion to compel and ordering Barnes to produce\n\n\n        10\n           Barnes argues the trial court abused its ministerial duty by not enforcing the alleged Rule\n11 agreement as an agreed judgment dismissing the suit. She also argues the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by not issuing a declaratory judgment declaring the rights of the parties, as a matter of law,\nunder the Rule 11 agreement. Because Barnes’s breach of contract claim and accord and satisfaction\ndefense presented issues of fact, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by submitting\nthose issues to the jury. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.007 (West 2008 & Supp. 2012) (if\ndeclaratory judgment “involves the determination of an issue of fact, the issue may be tried and\ndetermined in the same manner as issues of fact are tried and determined in other civil actions);\nStaley v. Herblin, 188 S.W.3d 334, 336 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, pet. denied) (holding fact issues\nas to the existence of a Rule 11 settlement agreement—when proposed settlement documents were\nunsigned and agreement was evidenced only by series of letters, documents, and communications\nbetween the parties—precluded entry of an agreed judgment).\n\n                                                   16\n\fdocuments responsive to several specific requests for production and overruling her objections to\n\nsuch requests. UFCU filed a motion to enforce the June 12, 2006 order, and a hearing was held on\n\nJuly 5, 2006. After the hearing, the trial court entered an order partially granting UFCU’s motion\n\nto enforce—ordering that Barnes respond only to Request for Production 26 and awarding UFCU\n\n$500 in attorneys’ fees.\n\n               On appeal, Barnes argues the trial court abused its discretion by sanctioning her $500\n\nin attorneys’ fees. But UFCU’s motions to compel and enforce were not included in the record, and\n\nthe record does not otherwise reflect the questions posed by UFCU’s requests for production\n\nor Barnes’s responses. Barnes had the burden “to supply us an appellate record demonstrating\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion.” University of Tex. at Austin v. Hinton, 822 S.W.2d 197, 202\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1991, no writ). Without the requests for production and responses, we cannot\n\nappraise whether the trial court abused its discretion and “must presume that the missing documents\n\nwould sustain the trial court’s ruling.” Id. (presuming interrogatories and answers missing from\n\nrecord would sustain’s trial court’s discovery sanction); see also Christiansen v. Prezelski,\n\n782 S.W.2d 842, 843 (Tex. 1990). We therefore overrule Barnes’s third issue on appeal.\n\n\n                                   SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n               In her fourth issue, Barnes argues the trial court erred in granting partial summary\n\njudgment in favor of UFCU and GEICO. Barnes raised this identical issue in her previous appeal\n\nin this case. Barnes, 2010 WL 2133946, at *3. After a careful and thorough review of the summary\n\njudgment evidence, we held “the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of\n\nUFCU and GEICO.” Id. at *8. Under the law of the case doctrine, “questions of law decided on\n\n                                                17\n\fappeal to a court of last resort will govern the case throughout its subsequent stages.” Hudson v.\n\nWakefield, 711 S.W.2d 628, 630 (Tex. 1986). Having already concluded as a matter of law that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in granting partial summary judgment, we overrule Barnes’s\n\nfourth issue on appeal.\n\n\n                                    RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL\n\n                In her final issue on appeal, Barnes alleges— in over thirty pages of argument—that\n\nshe was deprived of her right to a fair trial due to a multitude of complaints, including the following\n\nas stated in the title of her issue: (1) bad faith litigation tactics employed by appellees, (2) incurable\n\njury argument, (3) incurable interjection of matters in violation of the motion in limine, (4) malicious\n\ninterjection of irrelevant and inadmissible matters to prejudice the jury, (5) perjury by Appellees’\n\nwitnesses, (6) false evidence, (7) misleading testimony by persons without personal knowledge,\n\n(8) incompetent evidence, (9) intentional non-disclosure of pertinent evidence and witnesses with\n\nknowledge of relevant facts, (10) misstatement of the law, (11) deliberately misleading the jury to\n\nmake them to believe there were two loans when there is no promissory note or other loan\n\nagreement, (12) false testimony based on speculation, conjecture, and surmise, (13) introduction of\n\nletters of UFCU without allowing letters and evidence from Barnes,11 (14) discovery abuse, and\n\n(15) unfair comment on the evidence. In addition to the foregoing complaints, she challenges the\n\nlegal sufficiency of every unfavorable jury finding,12 and raises complaints regarding her trial\n\n        11\n          We concluded in our prior discussion of the alleged Rule 11 agreement that this was not\nan abuse of discretion.\n        12\n           We have already concluded that Barnes did not establish as a matter of law her breach of\ncontract claim arising from the alleged Rule 11 agreement or her affirmative defense of accord and\nsatisfaction.\n\n                                                   18\n\fcounsel’s withdrawal from the case after trial. Many of these complaints are encompassed in her\n\nlegal sufficiency challenges, and some complaints have been addressed—as noted— in other sections\n\nof the opinion. After reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we will address any remaining\n\nand adequately briefed complaints, and then address whether the cumulative affect of these alleged\n\nerrors caused an unfair trial.\n\n\n                                 Legal Sufficiency of Jury’s Findings\n\n                 Barnes complains there is no evidence to support the jury’s findings in favor of\n\nUFCU on its breach of contract claim and damages.13 Specifically, she argues there is no evidence\n\nsupporting the jury’s findings that (1) Barnes and UFCU entered into 2 loan agreements, (2) Barnes\n\nfailed to comply with the loan agreements, and (3) UFCU suffered $11,022.33 in damages as a result\n\nof the breach.\n\n                 When, as here, an appellant attacks the legal sufficiency of an adverse finding on an\n\nissue for which she did not have the burden of proof, she must demonstrate that there is no evidence\n\nto support the adverse finding. Croucher v. Croucher, 660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex. 1983). “We will\n\nsustain a no evidence point of error when (1) the record discloses a complete absence of evidence\n\nof a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only\n\n\n        13\n           Barnes additionally challenges the legal sufficiency of the jury’s finding that UFCU did\nnot breach the loan agreement. Barnes argues “there is no evidence to support this finding as a\nmatter of law because there was no evidence of the terms and conditions of the loan agreement.”\nAs Barnes had the burden of proof for her breach of contract claim, it is her burden on appeal to\nestablish as a matter of law that UFCU breached the terms of the agreement. See Sterner v.\nMarathon Oil Co., 767 S.W.2d 686, 690 (Tex. 1989). As she admits she did not establish as a matter\nof law the terms of the agreement or how UFCU breached those terms, we conclude she did not meet\nher burden of proof on appeal.\n\n                                                  19\n\fevidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more\n\nthan a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the vital fact.”\n\nMarathon Corp. v. Pitzner, 106 S.W.3d 724, 727 (Tex. 2003). In reviewing a no evidence point, we\n\nmust “credit favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregard contrary evidence unless\n\nreasonable jurors could not.” City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827. If more than a scintilla of evidence\n\nsupports the jury's finding, “the jury’s verdict . . . must be upheld.” Wal-Mart, Inc. v. Miller, 102\n\nS.W.3d 706, 709 (Tex. 2003).\n\n\n1.     Is the Breach of Contract Finding Supported by Legally Sufficient Evidence?\n\n                In reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s findings, we\n\nconclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s findings in favor of UFCU\n\non its breach of contract claim. First, Question 1 of the jury charge asked whether UFCU and Barnes\n\nhad agreed for UFCU “to provide two loans” to Barnes.14 The jury answered affirmatively, but on\n\nappeal, Barnes contends the parties only agreed to one loan and there is no evidence of a second loan.\n\nIn her live pleadings, however, Barnes pleaded that her negotiations with UFCU “culminated in two\n\nseparate loans being made.”15 Factual assertions in a party’s pleadings, not pled in the alternative,\n\nare considered formal judicial admissions and conclusively establish the facts asserted without the\n\nintroduction of the pleadings or other evidence. Houston First Am. Sav. v. Musick, 650 S.W.2d 764,\n\n767 (Tex. 1983). Accordingly, the fact that UFCU and Barnes entered into two loan agreements is\n\nconclusively established in the case without the introduction of other evidence.\n\n       14\n          UFCU contends they provided Barnes with two loans—one loan in the amount of $4,900\nand the other in the amount of $9,100.\n       15\n            See Plaintiff’s First Amended Petition and Plaintiff’s Supplemental Original Petition.\n\n                                                 20\n\f               Second, Question 3 of the jury charge asked whether Barnes had failed “to comply\n\nwith her loan agreements.” The jury answered affirmatively, after UFCU presented evidence that\n\nBarnes failed to comply with the loan agreements by not obtaining comprehensive and collision\n\ninsurance coverage for her vehicles securing the loans. UFCU admitted two documents, one for\n\neach loan, titled “Agreement to Provide Insurance” signed by Barnes. The Agreement provides that\n\n“I [Barnes] understand that one of the lender’s requirements is that I provide adequate insurance\n\ncoverage on the property securing my loan. This insurance must at least provide comprehensive\n\nand collision coverage.” There is no evidence in the record that Barnes obtained the required\n\ninsurance coverage. Barnes’s insurance statements from the relevant time period indicate that she had\n\nliability coverage on the vehicles but did not have comprehensive or collision coverage. As such, we\n\nconclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s finding that Barnes failed to\n\ncomply with the loan agreements.\n\n               We further conclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s\n\naward of damages in the amount of $11,022.33. A collection manager for UFCU testified that the\n\nprincipal, interest, late fees, and collateral protection insurance for the first loan totaled $3,084.74\n\nand for the second loan $7,937.59. The total for the two loans was $11,022.33—the exact amount\n\nof damages found by the jury. As such, we conclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence\n\nsupporting the jury’s damages award.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f2.      Are the Jury’s Findings of Attorneys’ Fees Supported by Sufficient Evidence?\n\n                Barnes further complains the amount of attorneys’ fees awarded to UFCU was\n\nexcessive and not supported by sufficient evidence.16 The reasonableness of attorneys’ fees is a fact\n\nquestion for the jury’s determination, and a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for the\n\njury’s. Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998); Barker v. Eckman, 213 S.W.3d 306, 314\n\n(Tex. 2006). But a party seeking attorneys’ fees must prove the reasonableness and necessity of the\n\nfees with competent evidence. Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991).\n\n                 The standard of review for remitting excessive damages, including excessive\n\n attorneys’ fees, is factual sufficiency. Pope v. Moore, 711 S.W.2d 622, 624 (Tex. 1986) (“Factual\n\n sufficiency is the sole remittitur standard for actual damages. In determining whether damages are\n\n excessive, trial courts and courts of appeals should employ the same test as for any factual sufficiency\n\n question.”); Olin Corp. v. Smith, 990 S.W.2d 789, 798 (Tex. App.—Austin 1999, pet. denied); see\n\n also Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21(holding court of appeals erred in ordering remittitur of award of\n\n attorneys’ fees without detailing all relevant evidence and explaining why evidence was factually\n\n insufficient to support award). Under this standard, we must “examine all the evidence in the record\n\n to determine whether sufficient evidence supports the damage award, remitting only if some portion\n\n is so factually insufficient or so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be\n\n manifestly unjust.” Pope, 711 S.W.2d at 624.\n\n\n         16\n            Barnes also argues the trial court abused its discretion by not segregating the award of\n attorneys’ fees. The jury question on fees did not segregate the amount of fees as to specific claims,\n and Barnes did not object. If there is no objection “to the fact that the attorney’s fees are not segregated\n as to specific claims, then the objection is waived.” Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 389\n (Tex. 1997). Accordingly, we conclude Barnes has waived this issue on appeal.\n\n                                                     22\n\f               Reviewing the evidence in light of this standard, we conclude there is sufficient\n\nevidence to support the $35,000 award of attorneys’ fees through trial but hold there is insufficient\n\nevidence to support the $25,000 award of attorneys’ fees to UFCU for an appeal to this Court. With\n\nregard to the attorneys’ fees incurred through trial, UFCU’s attorney of record testified that his firm\n\nhad expended 353 hours on the case and would require approximately sixty-five additional hours for\n\ntrial work, that the billable rates for the lawyers at his firm were between $150 to over $300 an hour,\n\nthat those rates were reasonable compared to other law firms of similar size, and that his client had\n\naccrued approximately $63,888.59 in attorneys’ fees in preparing the case and would incur an\n\nadditional $10,000 to $12,000 trying the case. UFCU’s attorney further testified that the amount of\n\nattorneys’ fees was reasonable and not unusual “considering what’s gone on for four and half\n\nyears”—including numerous pretrial hearings and motions. Barnes testified that she had incurred\n\nover $60,000 in fees representing herself in pretrial motions and hearings and that her trial counsel\n\nhad incurred another $25,000 in fees. Although UFCU’s total recovery in the case is less than the\n\namount of attorneys’ fees awarded, we conclude there is sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\n\naward of attorneys’ fees through trial based on the testimony regarding attorneys’ fees, the amount\n\nof time the case was pending, and the number of hearings and pre-trial filings. See USAA Cnty. Mut.\n\nIns. Co. v. Cook, 241 S.W.3d 93, 102-103 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.) (award\n\nof fees greatly exceeding actual damages factually sufficient); Bundren v. Holly Oaks Townhomes\n\nAss’n, Inc., 347 S.W.3d 421,441 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied) (“[T]here is no rule that fees\n\ncannot be more than actual damages.”).\n\n               We do not conclude, however, that there was sufficient evidence to support the full\n\namount of attorneys’ fees awarded to UFCU for an appeal to this Court. At trial, UFCU’s lawyer\n\n                                                  23\n\ftestified that his client would incur an additional $10,000 to $15,000 in attorneys’ fees if the case\n\nwere appealed to this Court. The lawyer’s testimony regarding appellate attorneys’ fees was not\n\nchallenged on cross-examination or otherwise contradicted by the record. Nevertheless, the jury\n\nfound UFCU should be awarded $25,000 for this appeal, and the trial court rendered judgment\n\naccordingly. The attorneys’ fees awarded to UFCU for this appeal clearly exceed the upper amounts\n\nto which its attorney testified. Because there is no evidence to support the jury’s full award of $25,000,\n\nthe award is excessive.17 See Valley Coca-Cola Bottling, Inc. v. Molina, 818 S.W.2d 146, 149 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1991, writ denied) (appellate attorneys’ fees excessive where amount awarded\n\nexceeded attorney’s testimony at trial).18\n\n                A court of appeals may exercise its power to suggest a remittitur when an appellant\n\ncomplains that there is insufficient evidence to support an award, and the court of appeals agrees but\n\nfinds that there is sufficient evidence to support a lesser award. Tex. R. App. P. 46.3; Akin, Gump,\n\nStrauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P., v. National Dev. & Research Corp., 299 S.W.3d 106, 123-24 (Tex.\n\n2009); Bechtel Corp. v. CITGO Prods. Pipeline Co., 271 S.W.3d 898, 922 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2008, no pet.). In this case, the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of attorneys’ fees for this\n\n        17\n            UFCU appears to concede this point in its brief by agreeing that there was evidence to\nsupport an award of appellate fees for $15,000 but mistakenly asserting that the trial court awarded\nUFCU $15,000 for this appeal instead of the $25,000 actually awarded: “Mr. Donley also testified\nthat if the matter was appealed it would take approximately another $15,000 to $10,000 in order to\nhandle that appeal at the Court of Appeals. . . . This evidence provides more than a scintilla of\nevidence upon which the jury could have based its verdict in this case, and upon which the Trial\nCourt could have relied in signing the judgment in this case awarding University $35,000 in\nattorneys’ fees, with an additional $15,000 in case of an appeal to this Court.”\n        18\n           Because UFCU’s attorney testified that an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas would\ncost between $10,000-$15,000, we do not conclude that the $15,000 award of attorneys’ fees for an\nappeal to the Supreme Court of Texas was excessive.\n\n                                                   24\n\fappeal in the amount of $15,000 but is insufficient to support the entire amount the jury found.\n\nAccordingly, we condition our affirmance on UFCU filing a remittitur in the trial court, within thirty\n\ndays of the date of this opinion, decreasing the award of appellate attorneys’ fees to $15,000 for this\n\nappeal. Tex. R. App. P. 46.3; see Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc. v. Owens, 951 S.W.2d 915, 920 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1997, no pet.) (suggesting remittitur of excess appellate attorneys’ fees when\n\namount awarded clearly exceeded the upper amounts to which attorney testified); see also Valley\n\nCoca-Cola Bottling, Inc., 818 S.W.2d at 149.\n\n\n3.     Did Barnes Establish as a Matter of Law Her DTPA Claim Against GEICO?\n\n               The jury found against Barnes on her DTPA claims against GEICO. On appeal,\n\nBarnes alleges there is no competent evidence to support the finding because GEICO’s sole witness\n\ncommitted “aggravated perjury” and “did not have personal knowledge and only engaged in rank\n\nspeculation, conjecture, and surmise and rendered nothing but bare legal opinions and conclusions\n\nthat were not relevant or reliable.” When a party attacks the legal sufficiency of an adverse finding\n\non an issue on which she has the burden of proof, she must demonstrate on appeal that the evidence\n\nestablishes, as a matter of law, all vital facts in support of the issue. Dow Chem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at\n\n241-42.\n\n               Barnes makes no attempt on appeal to explain how the evidence established all vital\n\nfacts in support of her DTPA claims. Her brief does not contain a clear argument as to how she\n\nestablished her DTPA claims, appropriate citations to authorities supporting her DTPA claims, or\n\ncitations to the record establishing the evidence in support of her DTPA claims. See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 38.1(I); see also G.R.A.V.I.T.Y. Enters., Inc. v. Reece Supply Co., 177 S.W.3d 537, 546 (Tex.\n\n                                                  25\n\fApp.—Dallas 2005, no pet.) (appellate court has no duty to search through the record without\n\nguidance from appellant to determine whether its assertion of reversible error is valid). Further,\n\nBarnes cites to no evidence—other than her own contrary testimony—of perjury, and Barnes did not\n\nobject to the testimony on the grounds she now asserts on appeal.19 See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). For\n\nthese reasons, we conclude Barnes has waived this issue on appeal.\n\n\n                                    Incurable Jury Argument\n\n               Barnes contends that opposing counsel engaged in numerous incurable jury\n\narguments during opening and closing statements. Barnes made two objections during opening and\n\nclosing statements, which we will review below. Barnes, however, did not preserve error as to her\n\nadditional complaints by including incurable jury argument as a point in her motion for new trial and\n\nhas thus waived error for those complaints not objected to at trial. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 324(b)(5)\n\n(point in a motion for new trial prerequisite to complaint on appeal of incurable jury argument if not\n\notherwise ruled on by trial court); Clark v. Bres, 217 S.W.3d 501, 509 n.1 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (“While no contemporaneous objection required in order to raise\n\nincurable jury argument on appeal, a party must include incurable jury argument as a point in a\n\nmotion for new trial.”).\n\n\n\n\n       19\n          Barnes only twice objected that the witness lacked personal knowledge—objecting that\nthe witness lacked personal knowledge to testify regarding an insurance policy from another carrier\nand objecting to the witness testifying to GEICO’s document production. The trial court sustained\nthe former objection and overruled the latter. Neither objection is the basis for Barnes’s current\nappeal. Barnes made no objection on the grounds that the testimony constituted “bare legal opinions\nand conclusions that were not relevant or reliable.”\n\n\n                                                 26\n\f                During opening statements, UFCU’s trial counsel violated the motion in limine by\n\ninforming the jury that Barnes had sought a temporary restraining order in the case. At a bench\n\nconference out of the hearing of the jury, Barnes objected but did not request that the trial court give\n\nthe jury an instruction to disregard. The trial court instructed UFCU’s counsel to not discuss the\n\ntemporary restraining order but did not give the jury an instruction to disregard. When evidence is\n\nplaced before the jury in violation of a motion in limine, an instruction to disregard is generally\n\nsufficient to cure error. See Barney v. State, 698 S.W.2d 114, 125 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985); Lusk v.\n\nState, 82 S.W.3d 57, 60-61 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2002, pet. denied). In situations where the\n\npotential harm can be cured by an instruction to disregard, the complainant must ask the court to so\n\ninstruct the jury to preserve error—unless the objectionable testimony was so inflammatory that it\n\nwould be impossible to remove the harmful impression from the jury’s mind. Lusk, 82 S.W.3d at\n\n60-61; Jones v. State, 825 S.W.2d 470, 473 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1991, writ ref’d). Barnes\n\ndid not request an instruction to disregard, and after reviewing the statement at issue, we cannot\n\nconclude that it was so inflammatory that an instruction would not have cured the error. Indeed,\n\nBarnes herself testified on cross-examination that she had filed a lawsuit and “got a TRO to restrain\n\nya’ll from doing what you did.” Based on the foregoing, we conclude Barnes has waived error.\n\n                Barnes also objected to UFCU’s stating during closing arguments that Barnes had\n\nthreatened violence in the event UFCU attempted to repossess her vehicles. During a preliminary\n\nhearing in the case, the following testimony occurred and was introduced into evidence at the jury trial:\n\n\n        Barnes:         This is going to lead to violence. I came here. I’ve\n                        already talked to them about that. They –\n\n                                                   27\n\f       Court:          Ms. Barnes, what do you mean this is going to lead to\n                       violence? I’m not sure I’m understanding that.\n\n       Barnes:         These people are stealing. They’re going to –\n\n       Court:          In what way do you mean – you’re an officer of the court.\n\n       Barnes:         Yes. It’s going to lead – you cannot come out and\n                       physically remove my transportation when I have two\n                       children to get to school, and that’s what they’re\n                       saying they’re going to do. I don’t owe the money. I\n                       have full coverage right now. There’s no reason for\n                       them to keep–\n\n       Court:          You’re anticipating that they are going to use violence?\n\n       Barnes:         Yes.\n\n       Court:          You’re not telling the Court that you intend to use violence?\n\n       Barnes:         If they use violence against me, you bet I am. I have\n                       a right to self defense. If they come after me, I have\n                       a right to defend myself and I will.\n\n       Court:          Okay. Well, I’m going to counsel you, Ms. Barnes, to be very\n                       careful. You’re an officer of the court.\n\n       Barnes:         I don’t care.\n\n\nDuring closing arguments, UFCU’s counsel stated: “Ms. Barnes has talked about how she tried to\n\nsurrender the vehicles, say I’ll just give them up, you know, you guys just take them. Well, we read\n\ninto evidence at the first hearing in this matter where Ms. Barnes threatens violence if anybody tries\n\nto take those.” Barnes’s counsel then objected on the grounds that Barnes’s statement was\n\nmisrepresented—that she had actually stated that UFCU would commit violence. The trial court did\n\nnot make an express ruling on the objection but instructed the jury: “Once again, ladies and\n\n                                                 28\n\fgentlemen, as I told you a while ago, you heard the evidence and we’ll go from there.” Barnes did\n\nnot request an express ruling or an instruction to disregard.\n\n               Based on the foregoing testimony, we conclude the jury argument was not improper\n\nbecause there was direct evidence, as well as inferences from the evidence which supported the\n\nargument. See Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Reese, 584 S.W.2d 835, 839-40 (Tex. 1979); Tex. R. Civ.\n\nP. 269; see also Gorman v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 859 S.W.2d 382, 389 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1993, no writ) (closing argument accusing other party’s agents of “bald-faced lies” not\n\nimproper where there was evidence from which jury could deduce agents misrepresented facts).\n\n“Whether by cross-examination or advocacy, the jury may be encouraged to weigh, evaluate, and\n\ntest the evidence before it.” Gorman, 850 S.W.2d at 389. Our review of the record reveals evidence\n\nfrom which the jury could conclude that Barnes threatened violence if UFCU attempted to repossess\n\nher vehicles, and therefore the jury argument was not improper.\n\n               Even if the argument could be regarded as improper, we do not regard it as so\n\ninflammatory or erroneous that proper instruction to the jury would not have cured it. Otis Elevator\n\nCo. v. Wood, 436 S.W.2d 324, 333 (Tex. 1968) (“If the argument is of a ‘curable’ nature, an objection\n\nto it must be promptly made and an instruction requested or the error is waived.”). Accordingly, we\n\nconclude UFCU’s argument was not improper, and Barnes waived error, if any, by not obtaining a\n\nruling on her objection and requesting an instruction to disregard. Id.; see also PopCap Games, Inc.\n\nv. MumboJumbo, LLC, 350 S.W.3d 699, 721 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied) (appellant\n\nwaived error by not obtaining express ruling on objection to jury argument where trial court stated:\n\n“Well, ladies and gentlemen, what was in evidence and what was not in evidence, you heard it,\n\nyou’re the ultimate deciders as to what was said and what was not.”).\n\n                                                 29\n\f                              Improper Comments on the Evidence\n\n               Barnes was the plaintiff in this suit, but she argues on appeal that she did not have the\n\nburden of proof for all questions submitted to the jury, and the trial court improperly placed the\n\nentire burden of proof on her by (1) improperly commenting on the weight of the evidence, and\n\n(2) jury charge error. We conclude Barnes waived error as to both complaints by not making a\n\ntimely, specific objection. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n               Barnes cites to two instances in the record where the trial court informed the jury that\n\nBarnes, as the plaintiff having the burden of proof at trial, would be allowed to proceed first during\n\nopening and closing arguments. But the record does not demonstrate that Barnes objected to the\n\ntrial court’s comments. A party waives appellate review when it fails to object to a trial judge’s\n\ncomments and request an instruction to disregard unless the comment could not have been rendered\n\nharmless by an instruction. Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Kinder Morgan Operating L.P., 192 S.W.3d 120,\n\n129 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.); see also Capellen v. Capellen, 888 S.W.2d\n\n539, 547 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1994, writ denied) (“Unless the comment by the judge is so blatantly\n\nand obviously prejudicial that it cannot be cured, an objection and request for instruction must be\n\nmade in order to preserve error.”). Upon proper objection and request for instruction, the trial court\n\ncould have easily negated error, if any, as to its comments concerning the burden of proof. We\n\ncannot conclude that its comment was so blatantly and obviously prejudicial that an instruction\n\nwould not have cured it. Accordingly, we conclude Barnes waived error, if any, as to this point.\n\n               Barnes further argues the trial court improperly placed the burden of proof on her for\n\nall questions in the jury charge. Reviewing the transcript from the charge conference, Barnes did\n\n\n\n                                                  30\n\fnot object to any question on the grounds that the question improperly placed the burden of proof\n\non the wrong party or request an appropriate instruction on the burden of proof. Our procedural rules\n\nprovide that any complaint to a jury charge is waived unless specifically included in an objection.\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 274; Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); see also In re B.L.D., 113 S.W.3d 340, 349 (Tex.\n\n2003) (“A party must make the trial court aware of the complaint, timely and plainly, and obtain a\n\nruling.”). As Barnes did not make the trial court aware of her complaint to the jury charge, she has\n\nwaived the issue on appeal.\n\n\n                                         Jury Misconduct\n\n               Barnes argues on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion by denying her\n\nmotion for new trial on the grounds of jury misconduct. Barnes alleges a juror, during deliberations,\n\nimproperly construed her credit report and shared this mistaken analysis with other jurors.\n\nSpecifically, she alleges in her motion for new trial and accompanying affidavit, that one juror\n\n“who claimed to have experience in reading credit bureau reports . . . stated as fact that Barnes’s\n\ncredit rating was the same before and after the bad faith reporting.” The credit report was admitted\n\nduring Barnes’s case-in-chief. Barnes’s sole evidence supporting her claims is her own affidavit.\n\nWe conclude that Barnes has failed to conclusively establish jury misconduct.\n\n               We review a trial court’s refusal to grant a motion for new trial for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Dolgencorp of Tex., Inc. v. Lerma, 288 S.W.3d 922, 926 (Tex. 2009). “To warrant a\n\nnew trial for jury misconduct, the movant must establish (1) that the misconduct occurred, (2) it was\n\nmaterial, and (3) probably caused injury.” Golden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson, 24 S.W.3d 362,\n\n372 (Tex. 2000). Whether misconduct occurred and caused injury is a question of fact for the trial\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fcourt. Id. Absent findings to the contrary, we assume that the trial court made all findings in support\n\nof its decision to deny the motion for new trial. Id. Consequently, Barnes had the burden to\n\nconclusively establish jury misconduct. Id.\n\n               We cannot conclude, based on the record before us, that Barnes conclusively\n\nestablished jury misconduct. First, an affidavit of a party or counsel is insufficient to establish jury\n\nmisconduct during deliberations because it must be presumed, because of the secretive nature of\n\njury deliberations, that the affidavit could not be based on personal knowledge. Pabich v. Kellar,\n\n71 S.W.3d 500, 510 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2002, pet. denied); Clancy v. Zale Corp., 705 S.W.2d\n\n820, 828 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Further, when the ground for a motion for new\n\ntrial is jury misconduct, the trial court may not admit—unless an outside influence was improperly\n\nbrought to bear upon any juror—juror testimony regarding statements made during deliberations or\n\n“evidence of any statement” by a juror which would otherwise be precluded. Tex. R. Civ. P. 327;\n\nTex. R. Evid. 606(b). We cannot conclude that the juror’s alleged analysis of Barnes’s properly\n\nadmitted credit report, based on the juror’s own experience or expertise, was misconduct resulting\n\nfrom an outside influence. See Golden Eagle Archery, Inc., 24 S.W.3d at 370 (“The rules contemplate\n\nthat an ‘an outside influence’ originates from sources other than the jurors themselves.”); Soliz v.\n\nSaenz, 779 S.W.2d 929, 932 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1989, writ denied) (juror’s interjection of\n\npersonal experience or expertise into discussion not an “outside influence”). As such, Barnes has\n\nfailed to present competent, admissible evidence of jury misconduct.\n\n               Finally, even if we had competent evidence to support Barnes’s allegations, we could\n\nnot conclude the juror engaged in misconduct by construing a credit report properly admitted into\n\nevidence. Even if the juror misunderstood the evidence in the credit report, a “[j]uror’s deductions,\n\n                                                  32\n\finferences from the evidence, and reasoning, though faulty, illogical, arbitrary or bizarre, do not\n\nconstitute misconduct.” Griffith v. Hudspeth , 378 S.W.2d 153, 156 (Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio\n\n1964, no writ). Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the\n\nmotion for new trial.\n\n\n                                          Discovery Abuse\n\n                Barnes argues GEICO engaged in discovery abuse by failing to disclose the identity\n\nof an employee who spoke with Barnes regarding her insurance coverage. We cannot appraise the\n\nmerit of Barnes’s claim because the relevant discovery questions and answers are not included in the\n\nrecord. See Hinton, 822 S.W.2d at 202. Further, Barnes does not point to anything in the record\n\nshowing the trial court overruled a motion, objection, or request for relief regarding the alleged\n\ndiscovery abuse. A complaint not presented to the trial court by a timely, specific objection is not\n\npreserved for appeal. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Hallett v. Houston Nw. Med. Ctr., 689 S.W.2d 888,\n\n890 (Tex. 1985) (“A party cannot wait until the trial is finished, then seek to reverse an unfavorable\n\nverdict by complaining of an error which the trial court could have corrected had it been timely\n\ninformed of the error.”); see also Warrantech Corp. v. Computer Adapters Servs. Inc., 134 S.W.3d 516,\n\n530-31 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, no pet.) (denial of motion for new trial on grounds of\n\ndiscovery abuse not abuse of discretion where complaining party failed to seek prior relief from trial\n\ncourt). Accordingly, we conclude Barnes has waived error, if any, regarding GEICO’s discovery\n\nresponses.\n\n\n                                        Motion to Withdraw\n\n               Barnes complains the trial court abused its discretion by permitting her trial counsel\n\nto “withdraw after trial before the judgment was ever signed and entered.” Her trial counsel’s\n\n                                                 33\n\fmotion to withdraw and the trial court’s order granting such motion are not included in the record.\n\nIt is the burden of the appellant to bring forward a sufficient record to show the error committed by\n\nthe trial court. Christiansen, 782 S.W.2d at 843. Barnes does not include sufficient facts, argument,\n\nor authority for us to render judgment on this issue without reviewing the motion to withdraw and\n\nthe trial court’s order. We do, however, note that Barnes herself is an attorney with over twenty-five\n\nyears’ experience who represented herself in this matter up until trial and adequately perfected\n\nher own appeal. Accordingly, based on the record before us, we cannot conclude that counsel’s\n\nwithdrawal probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment or probably prevented Barnes\n\nfrom presenting her own case on appeal. Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(a).\n\n\n         False Accusations and Inflammatory Statements, Comments, and Arguments\n\n               Barnes makes numerous complaints regarding statements made by witnesses and\n\nattorneys at trial referring to her credit history, driving record, and occupation as a lawyer. To the\n\nextent Barnes objected to these comments, we conclude the evidence was relevant, and the trial court\n\ncould have concluded the probative value of the evidence was considerable compared to its potential\n\nto unfairly prejudice Barnes. See Tex. R. Evid. 403. First, Barnes herself testified at trial during\n\ndirect examination that she was an attorney practicing law for over twenty-five years, and the fact\n\nthat she was an attorney was relevant as she had represented herself during much of the litigation.\n\nIn addition, Barnes’s credit history prior to her loan with UFCU was relevant to the type of loan\n\nUFCU offered and the terms of such loan, and her driving record was relevant to the type of\n\ninsurance policy offered by GEICO and the cost of such policy—all contested issues at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\f                                         Right to a Fair Trial\n\n                In her final complaint, Barnes argues that the cumulative effect of the aforementioned\n\nalleged errors deprived her of the right to a fair trial under the United States and Texas Constitutions.\n\nA number of errors may be found harmful in their cumulative effect. See Strange v. Treasure City,\n\n608 S.W.2d 604, 609 (Tex. 1980). However, in the multitude of issues Barnes presented in this\n\nappeal, we concluded the trial court committed only one error by rendering excessive attorneys’ fees\n\nto UFCU. Such error will be remedied by this Court through a suggestion of remittitur. As such,\n\nwe cannot conclude that Barnes was deprived of her right to a fair trial.\n\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n                We affirm the trial court’s judgment conditioned on UFCU’s filing a remittitur in the\n\ntrial court decreasing its award of attorneys’ fees for this appeal to $15,000 and notifying this Court\n\nof the filing. If the remittitur is filed within thirty days of the date of this opinion, we will reform\n\nthe judgment and affirm as modified. Otherwise, we will reverse the trial court’s judgment as to\n\nattorneys’ fees for this appeal and remand this cause for redetermination of attorneys’ fees for this\n\nappeal. See Tex. R.

In our prior opinion, we affirmed the trial court’s severance\n\norder and partial summary judgment in favor of UFCU and GEICO. Barnes’s remaining claims and\n\nUFCU’s counterclaims proceeded to a jury trial. Barnes appeals from a final judgment, consistent\n\nwith the jury’s findings, denying her breach of contract and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA)\n\nclaims and awarding UFCU damages and attorneys’ fees. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm\n\nthe judgment conditioned on UFCU filing a remittitur reducing its award of attorneys’ fees for this\n\nappeal to $15,000.\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               The factual and procedural background of this case is fully set forth in our prior\n\nopinion. See Barnes v. University Fed. Credit Union, No. 03-09-00003-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2133946</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin May 27, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.). Generally stated, however, Barnes obtained\n\ntwo loans from UFCU for $14,066 using two personal vehicles as collateral. The loan agreements\n\nrequired Barnes to obtain comprehensive and collision insurance coverage. After sending Barnes\n\nnumerous letters requesting a copy of the required insurance and not receiving the requested proof,\n\nUFCU issued collateral protection insurance (CPI) and added the $1,600 premium to the loan\n\nbalance. On August 25, 2005, Barnes filed suit against UFCU and GEICO, her insurance carrier,\n\npleading numerous causes of action, including breach of contract against UFCU and DTPA claims\n\nagainst GEICO—alleging that GEICO had misled her regarding the scope of her coverage.\n\n               On April 5, 2006, UFCU sent Barnes a settlement proposal stating that in return for\n\n$8,000, UFCU would consider the relevant loans to be paid in full, release the liens on her vehicles,\n\nand forego collection of any late fees, penalties, interest, or attorneys’ fees. The proposal further\n\nstates, “UFCU and Barnes will execute reasonable and mutually agreeable full releases and other\n\nsettlement documentation necessary to fully resolve and dismiss the current proceedings.” The letter\n\ncontained a signature line for Barnes to sign acknowledging that she “agreed and accepted” the\n\nagreement. Barnes did not sign. Rather, she sent UFCU a cashier’s check for $8,000 accompanied\n\nby a letter dated April 11, 2006, stating, “I am in receipt of your extortion demand with threats of\n\nadditional economic and financial terrorism if I do not comply with your demands. This ransom and\n\nextortion money is being paid under extreme economic and financial duress and not because it is due\n\nand owing.” The letter goes on to state that the funds were being tendered “with all rights reserved”\n\n                                                 2\n\fand asserting claims of over $400,000 against UFCU in damages and attorneys’ fees. UFCU sent\n\nnotice that it would not accept Barnes’s check unless she signed a release of all claims. Barnes did\n\nnot sign a release, and UFCU declined to negotiate the $8,000 check. Barnes filed UFCU’s letter\n\nwith the trial court as a Rule 11 agreement and amended her pleadings to add an additional breach\n\nof contract claim against UFCU, alleging that UFCU had breached the parties’ Rule 11 agreement\n\nby proceeding with litigation after receiving her cashier’s check for $8,000.\n\n               Eventually, all parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of UFCU and GEICO on all of Barnes’s claims except for her two breach of\n\ncontract claims against UFCU—one claim arising from the loan agreement and the other from\n\nthe alleged Rule 11 agreement—and her DTPA claims against GEICO. Prior to GEICO’s filing a\n\nmotion to sever the causes of action that had been decided on summary judgment, Barnes filed\n\nsupplemental pleadings adding new causes of action, including claims for breach of fiduciary duty\n\nand breach of fair debt collection laws against UFCU (“supplemental claims”). The trial court\n\nentered an order of severance, severing out those causes of action that had already been decided and\n\nordering Barnes to proceed only with her two breach of contract claims against UFCU and her DTPA\n\nclaims against GEICO. On appeal, we affirmed the summary judgment and order of severance.\n\n               Barnes’s remaining claims, as well as UFCU’s counterclaims, proceeded to a jury\n\ntrial. In addition, the trial court allowed her to proceed with her supplemental fair debt collection\n\nclaim against UFCU. The jury found that Barnes breached her loan agreements with UFCU, UFCU\n\ndid not breach the loan agreements, and Barnes’s breach was unexcused by her affirmative defenses.\n\nThe jury awarded UFCU damages of $11,022.33 and attorneys’ fees of $35,000 for preparation and\n\ntrial, $25,000 for an appeal to the court of appeals, and $15,000 for an appeal to the Supreme Court\n\n                                                 3\n\fof Texas. The jury further found against Barnes on her breach of contract claim arising from the\n\nalleged Rule 11 agreement, finding that the parties had not entered into an enforceable settlement\n\nagreement and against her DTPA claims against GEICO. But the jury did find in favor of Barnes\n\non her fair debt collection claim against UFCU and awarded her $1,049.96 in damages and $35,000\n\nin attorneys’ fees.1 The trial court entered final judgment in accordance with the jury’s findings.\n\n               In five issues on appeal, Barnes argues the trial court erred by: (1) improperly severing\n\nher supplemental claims and not submitting jury questions for those claims, (2) not enforcing the\n\nalleged Rule 11 agreement as a matter of law, (3) assessing discovery sanctions against her in the\n\namount of $500, (4) granting summary judgment in favor of GEICO and UFCU, and (5) depriving\n\nher of her right to a fair trial due to numerous complaints, including improper jury argument, improper\n\ncomment on the evidence, violation of the motion in limine, discovery abuse, and insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s findings.\n\n\n                                    ORDER OF SEVERANCE\n\n               In her first issue on appeal, Barnes argues the trial court erred by (1) improperly\n\nsevering her supplemental claims and (2) refusing to submit those claims to the jury. UFCU contends\n\nthat this Court has already determined and rejected Barnes’s argument in her prior appeal, and even\n\nif we choose to revisit the issue, Barnes failed to preserve error by requesting jury questions for her\n\nsupplemental claims. We agree with UFCU that we already addressed the propriety of the severance\n\norder in our prior opinion. With regard to the jury charge, we conclude the trial court submitted all\n\ngrounds of recovery supported by the evidence and properly requested by counsel.\n\n\n       1\n        UFCU does not appeal the jury’s finding on Barnes’s fair debt collection claim or the award\nof damages and attorneys’ fees.\n\n                                                  4\n\f               In her prior appeal before this Court, Barnes argued that the trial court’s severance\n\norder improperly severed her supplemental claims. We concluded that, even if the order improperly\n\nsevered claims that had not been resolved on summary judgment, the issue was remedied because\n\nthe trial court permitted Barnes to proceed at trial on claims that were raised for the first time after\n\nthe summary judgment order. Indeed, Barnes obtained a favorable jury verdict on her supplemental\n\nfair debt collection claim. “Under the law of the case doctrine, a court of appeals is ordinarily bound\n\nby its initial decision if there is a subsequent appeal in the same case.” Briscoe v. Goodmark Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1370803\"><a href=\"/opinion/1370803/briscoe-v-goodmark-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716-17 (Tex. 2003). Barnes has not presented new facts, legal analysis, or\n\nargument that would change the disposition of this issue. Accordingly, the law of the case doctrine\n\nbars its reconsideration.\n\n               With regard to the trial court’s submission of Barnes’s supplemental claims to the\n\njury, the trial court did submit—as previously noted—a jury question on Barnes’s supplemental fair\n\ndebt collection claim. For Barnes’s remaining supplemental claims, she only requested and obtained\n\na ruling on her supplemental claim for breach of fiduciary duty against UFCU. Trial courts are\n\nrequired “to submit requested questions to the jury if the pleadings and any evidence support them.”\n\nElbaor v.

Upon\n\nreview of the record, we cannot find—nor does Barnes identify in her brief—evidence of extraneous\n\nfacts or conduct by UFCU creating a fiduciary relationship. Further, because Barnes had never done\n\nbusiness at UFCU before, there is no evidence of a long-standing relationship of trust that might\n\ncreate a fiduciary relationship. See Thigpen, 363 S.W.2d at 253; Fleming v. Texas Coastal Bank of\n\nPasadena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335448\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335448/fleming-v-texas-coastal-bank-of-pasadena/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied). As there was\n\nnot sufficient evidence to support a breach of fiduciary duty claim, we conclude the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by omitting the requested ground of recovery from the jury charge.\n\n                We further conclude that Barnes has waived error as to all other supplemental claims.\n\nDuring a discussion of the supplemental claims at pretrial conference, Barnes’s counsel expressly\n\nadvised the trial court that the only supplemental claim her client would pursue at trial was the fair\n\ndebt collection claim based on UFCU improperly reporting Barnes’s debt: “I’m just submitting a\n\njury issue about the unfair debt reporting.” At the charge conference, Barnes’s counsel additionally\n\nsought a jury question on the breach of fiduciary duty claim. But Barnes did not timely request in\n\nwriting a jury question for any other supplemental claim.2 See Tex. R. Civ. P. 278. Further, Barnes’s\n\n\n       2\n          The record reflects Barnes filed proposed jury questions for some supplemental claims a\nmonth after the jury returned its verdict but did not obtain a ruling on these untimely requests.

See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 38.1(I). On appeal, all independent grounds of recovery “not conclusively established under the\n\nevidence and no element of which is submitted or requested are waived.” Tex. R. Civ. P. 279.\n\nBecause Barnes failed to request jury questions on any other supplemental claims and has not\n\nconclusively established those claims under the evidence, we conclude she has waived error.\n\n\n                             ALLEGED RULE 11 AGREEMENT\n\n               Barnes also argues the trial court erred in denying her motions for directed verdict,\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict, and new trial because she established as a matter of law:\n\n(1) her breach of contract claim against UFCU arising from the alleged Rule 11 agreement, or in the\n\nalternative, (2) her affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction to UFCU’s breach of contract\n\nclaim arising from the loan agreement.3 Barnes’s argument is twofold: first, she argues her $8,000\n\ncashier’s check and accompanying letter, tendered in response to UFCU’s settlement proposal,\n\nconstituted a valid acceptance of UFCU’s offer creating an enforceable settlement agreement.4\n\n       3\n         Barnes also argues on appeal that the trial court erred by denying her three motions for\nsummary judgment seeking enforcement of the alleged Rule 11 agreement. Where a motion for\nsummary judgment is denied by the trial court and tried on its merits, the order denying the motion\nfor summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal. Ackermann v.

In the alternative, Barnes argues she established the affirmative defense of accord and\n\nsatisfaction to UFCU’s breach of contract claim arising from the loan agreement. Specifically, she\n\nargues her tender of the $8,000 cashier’s check and accompanying letter constituted a new agreement\n\nbetween the parties that should operate as an accord and satisfaction, thereby discharging her\n\nobligations under the original loan contract. The jury again disagreed, finding Barnes breached the loan\n\nagreement and did not meet her burden of proof for the affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction.\n\n\n                                         Standard of Review\n\n                The substance of Barnes’s argument is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the\n\njury’s findings.5 See City of Keller v.

Barnes had the\n\nburden of proof both on her breach of contract claim against UFCU arising from the alleged Rule 11\n\nagreement and on her affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction.

See\nTex. R. Civ. P. 324(b). A point in a motion for new trial is a prerequisite to complain on appeal that\nthe evidence is factually insufficient to support a jury finding. Id. Embedded within a point in her\nmotion for new trial discussing deliberations and titled “Jury Misconduct,” Barnes generally alleges\nthat she established as a matter of law an accord and satisfaction “and, in any event, any opposite\nfindings would be contrary to the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.” In over thirty-\nfive pages of argument, Barnes provides no further support, authority, or evidence to apprise the\ntrial court that she was challenging the factual sufficiency of any jury findings. We conclude that\nBarnes’s argument did not clearly identify that she was challenging the factual sufficiency of the\njury’s findings, nor was she specific enough to give the trial court proper notice of the matter at\nissue; she has thus failed to preserve error.

Is the Breach of Contract Finding Supported by Legally Sufficient Evidence?\n\n                In reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s findings, we\n\nconclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s findings in favor of UFCU\n\non its breach of contract claim. First, Question 1 of the jury charge asked whether UFCU and Barnes\n\nhad agreed for UFCU “to provide two loans” to Barnes.14 The jury answered affirmatively, but on\n\nappeal, Barnes contends the parties only agreed to one loan and there is no evidence of a second loan.\n\nIn her live pleadings, however, Barnes pleaded that her negotiations with UFCU “culminated in two\n\nseparate loans being made.”15 Factual assertions in a party’s pleadings, not pled in the alternative,\n\nare considered formal judicial admissions and conclusively establish the facts asserted without the\n\nintroduction of the pleadings or other evidence. Houston First Am. Sav. v. Musick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1502647\"><a href=\"/opinion/1502647/houston-first-american-sav-v-musick/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n767 (Tex. 1983). Accordingly, the fact that UFCU and Barnes entered into two loan agreements is\n\nconclusively established in the case without the introduction of other evidence.\n\n       14\n          UFCU contends they provided Barnes with two loans—one loan in the amount of $4,900\nand the other in the amount of $9,100.\n       15\n            See Plaintiff’s First Amended Petition and Plaintiff’s Supplemental Original Petition.\n\n                                                 20\n\f               Second, Question 3 of the jury charge asked whether Barnes had failed “to comply\n\nwith her loan agreements.” The jury answered affirmatively, after UFCU presented evidence that\n\nBarnes failed to comply with the loan agreements by not obtaining comprehensive and collision\n\ninsurance coverage for her vehicles securing the loans. UFCU admitted two documents, one for\n\neach loan, titled “Agreement to Provide Insurance” signed by Barnes. The Agreement provides that\n\n“I [Barnes] understand that one of the lender’s requirements is that I provide adequate insurance\n\ncoverage on the property securing my loan. This insurance must at least provide comprehensive\n\nand collision coverage.” There is no evidence in the record that Barnes obtained the required\n\ninsurance coverage. Barnes’s insurance statements from the relevant time period indicate that she had\n\nliability coverage on the vehicles but did not have comprehensive or collision coverage. As such, we\n\nconclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s finding that Barnes failed to\n\ncomply with the loan agreements.\n\n               We further conclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s\n\naward of damages in the amount of $11,022.33. A collection manager for UFCU testified that the\n\nprincipal, interest, late fees, and collateral protection insurance for the first loan totaled $3,084.74\n\nand for the second loan $7,937.59. The total for the two loans was $11,022.33—the exact amount\n\nof damages found by the jury. As such, we conclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence\n\nsupporting the jury’s damages award.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f2.      Are the Jury’s Findings of Attorneys’ Fees Supported by Sufficient Evidence?\n\n                Barnes further complains the amount of attorneys’ fees awarded to UFCU was\n\nexcessive and not supported by sufficient evidence.16 The reasonableness of attorneys’ fees is a fact\n\nquestion for the jury’s determination, and a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for the\n\njury’s.

Under this standard, we must “examine all the evidence in the record\n\n to determine whether sufficient evidence supports the damage award, remitting only if some portion\n\n is so factually insufficient or so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be\n\n manifestly unjust.” Pope, 711 S.W.2d at 624.\n\n\n         16\n            Barnes also argues the trial court abused its discretion by not segregating the award of\n attorneys’ fees. The jury question on fees did not segregate the amount of fees as to specific claims,\n and Barnes did not object. If there is no objection “to the fact that the attorney’s fees are not segregated\n as to specific claims, then the objection is waived.” Green Int’l, Inc. v.

Accordingly, we conclude Barnes has waived this issue on appeal.\n\n                                                     22\n\f               Reviewing the evidence in light of this standard, we conclude there is sufficient\n\nevidence to support the $35,000 award of attorneys’ fees through trial but hold there is insufficient\n\nevidence to support the $25,000 award of attorneys’ fees to UFCU for an appeal to this Court. With\n\nregard to the attorneys’ fees incurred through trial, UFCU’s attorney of record testified that his firm\n\nhad expended 353 hours on the case and would require approximately sixty-five additional hours for\n\ntrial work, that the billable rates for the lawyers at his firm were between $150 to over $300 an hour,\n\nthat those rates were reasonable compared to other law firms of similar size, and that his client had\n\naccrued approximately $63,888.59 in attorneys’ fees in preparing the case and would incur an\n\nadditional $10,000 to $12,000 trying the case. UFCU’s attorney further testified that the amount of\n\nattorneys’ fees was reasonable and not unusual “considering what’s gone on for four and half\n\nyears”—including numerous pretrial hearings and motions. Barnes testified that she had incurred\n\nover $60,000 in fees representing herself in pretrial motions and hearings and that her trial counsel\n\nhad incurred another $25,000 in fees. Although UFCU’s total recovery in the case is less than the\n\namount of attorneys’ fees awarded, we conclude there is sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\n\naward of attorneys’ fees through trial based on the testimony regarding attorneys’ fees, the amount\n\nof time the case was pending, and the number of hearings and pre-trial filings.

At trial, UFCU’s lawyer\n\n                                                  23\n\ftestified that his client would incur an additional $10,000 to $15,000 in attorneys’ fees if the case\n\nwere appealed to this Court.

Nevertheless, the jury\n\nfound UFCU should be awarded $25,000 for this appeal, and the trial court rendered judgment\n\naccordingly. The attorneys’ fees awarded to UFCU for this appeal clearly exceed the upper amounts\n\nto which its attorney testified. Because there is no evidence to support the jury’s full award of $25,000,\n\nthe award is excessive.17 See Valley Coca-Cola Bottling, Inc. v.

In this case, the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of attorneys’ fees for this\n\n        17\n            UFCU appears to concede this point in its brief by agreeing that there was evidence to\nsupport an award of appellate fees for $15,000 but mistakenly asserting that the trial court awarded\nUFCU $15,000 for this appeal instead of the $25,000 actually awarded: “Mr. Donley also testified\nthat if the matter was appealed it would take approximately another $15,000 to $10,000 in order to\nhandle that appeal at the Court of Appeals. . . .

They’re going to –\n\n       Court:          In what way do you mean – you’re an officer of the court.\n\n       Barnes:         Yes. It’s going to lead – you cannot come out and\n                       physically remove my transportation when I have two\n                       children to get to school, and that’s what they’re\n                       saying they’re going to do. I don’t owe the money. I\n                       have full coverage right now. There’s no reason for\n                       them to keep–\n\n       Court:          You’re anticipating that they are going to use violence?\n\n       Barnes:         Yes.\n\n       Court:          You’re not telling the Court that you intend to use violence?\n\n       Barnes:         If they use violence against me, you bet I am. I have\n                       a right to self defense. If they come after me, I have\n                       a right to defend myself and I will.\n\n       Court:          Okay. Well, I’m going to counsel you, Ms. Barnes, to be very\n                       careful. You’re an officer of the court.\n\n       Barnes:         I don’t care.\n\n\nDuring closing arguments, UFCU’s counsel stated: “Ms. Barnes has talked about how she tried to\n\nsurrender the vehicles, say I’ll just give them up, you know, you guys just take them. Well, we read\n\ninto evidence at the first hearing in this matter where Ms. Barnes threatens violence if anybody tries\n\nto take those.” Barnes’s counsel then objected on the grounds that Barnes’s statement was\n\nmisrepresented—that she had actually stated that UFCU would commit violence. The trial court did\n\nnot make an express ruling on the objection but instructed the jury: “Once again, ladies and\n\n                                                 28\n\fgentlemen, as I told you a while ago, you heard the evidence and we’ll go from there.” Barnes did\n\nnot request an express ruling or an instruction to disregard.\n\n               Based on the foregoing testimony, we conclude the jury argument was not improper\n\nbecause there was direct evidence, as well as inferences from the evidence which supported the\n\nargument.

Barnes does not include sufficient facts, argument,\n\nor authority for us to render judgment on this issue without reviewing the motion to withdraw and\n\nthe trial court’s order. We do, however, note that Barnes herself is an attorney with over twenty-five\n\nyears’ experience who represented herself in this matter up until trial and adequately perfected\n\nher own appeal. Accordingly, based on the record before us, we cannot conclude that counsel’s\n\nwithdrawal probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment or probably prevented Barnes\n\nfrom presenting her own case on appeal.

To the\n\nextent Barnes objected to these comments, we conclude the evidence was relevant, and the trial court\n\ncould have concluded the probative value of the evidence was considerable compared to its potential\n\nto unfairly prejudice Barnes. See Tex. R. Evid. 403. First, Barnes herself testified at trial during\n\ndirect examination that she was an attorney practicing law for over twenty-five years, and the fact\n\nthat she was an attorney was relevant as she had represented herself during much of the litigation.\n\nIn addition, Barnes’s credit history prior to her loan with UFCU was relevant to the type of loan\n\nUFCU offered and the terms of such loan, and her driving record was relevant to the type of\n\ninsurance policy offered by GEICO and the cost of such policy—all contested issues at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\f                                         Right to a Fair Trial\n\n                In her final complaint, Barnes argues that the cumulative effect of the aforementioned\n\nalleged errors deprived her of the right to a fair trial under the United States and Texas Constitutions.\n\nA number of errors may be found harmful in their cumulative effect.
