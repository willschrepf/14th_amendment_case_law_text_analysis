FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt Phase\n\n            1. Prosecution Case\n\n               a. Fatal Attack on Daniel Addis (Counts 1 and 2)\n       In August 1997, defendant and the homicide victim, Daniel Addis, were\ninmates at the California Institution for Men in Chino and housed in the\nadministrative segregation unit (ASU). That housing unit is reserved for inmates\nwho present safety or management concerns, including inmates awaiting\nadjudication for violations of prison rules. Defendant, who was serving a sentence\nof 25 years to life under the “Three Strikes law”, was a member of a White\nsupremacist gang called the Nazi Lowriders (NLR), as was his cellmate Gary\nGreen. Defendant and Green were housed on tier 3 of ASU.\n       Addis, who was not a gang member, had been placed in ASU for assaulting\na staff member. He had previously been housed on tier 3, but in July, he had\nasked to be moved to another tier. He told the guard to whom he made the request\nthat he had stolen tobacco from NLR gang members. Commission of this offense\nby one who was not a member of the gang would have resulted in retaliation from\nthe gang. Addis was moved off tier 3 and eventually housed in a single cell on tier\n1 of ASU.\n       Although Addis was housed on a tier different from defendant and other\nNLR members, he exercised in the same yard, one of four that were segregated by\nrace and gang affiliation. The procedure for moving inmates from their cells to\nthe exercise yards involved stringent security protocols. The yard was searched\nfor weapons before any inmate was allowed to enter. In addition, the inmates\n\n\n                                         2\n\fwere subjected to repeated searches before they were allowed into the yard. These\nincluded a visual strip search in their cells, passing through a metal detector, a\nhand search of their person and effects and a final search by a hand-held metal\ndetector before they were admitted to the yard one at a time. As part of the strip\nsearch, they were required to squat and cough to determine if they were trying to\nsmuggle contraband in their rectums. Once allowed into the yard, inmates were\nrequired to line up against the fence until all inmates were in the yard.\nCorrectional officers in the guard tower could observe all four exercise yards.\n       On Sunday, August 3, 1997, all of the White inmates, except Addis, had\nentered their exercise yard. Defendant‟s cellmate, Gary Green, who was a “shot\ncaller” and leader of the NLR gang, started yelling at the gate guard, Rosamaria\nMaldonado, to let Addis out into the yard. Inmates were subject to monthly\nclassification reviews to determine, among other matters, whether they were\neligible for the yard. If they were eligible, each decided whether to avail himself\nof the yard privilege. Addis was eligible to go into the yard and had done so the\nprevious Thursday without incident.\n       Maldonado went to her superior, Sergeant Arioma Sams, and told him the\nother inmates were demanding that Addis be brought out into the yard. Sams\ntestified that he checked the yard for unusual activity but did not observe any.\nTimothy Ginn, another guard on duty that day, testified he told Sams that if Addis\nwent out into the yard he might get “beat up.” Sams replied that their hands were\ntied because Addis had a right to go into the yard if he wanted to. Ginn told Addis\n“you don‟t have to go if you don‟t want to.” Addis replied, “Fuck that. I want to\ngo.” Laramie McAlmond, another guard, testified that she overheard Ginn‟s\nconversation with Addis and confirmed that Addis said he wanted to go out to the\nyard. She testified that Addis said, “Everything‟s squashed,” which is prison slang\nfor everything is settled and there are no problems.\n\n                                          3\n\f        Addis was released into the yard at 9:30 or 9:45 a.m., about 30 to 45\nminutes after defendant and Green had entered the yard. Officer Frank Esqueda,\none of the two tower guards on duty, testified that Addis joined the other inmates\nin exercises, and then walked around and talked to a few inmates. Esqueda\nobserved Green and defendant walking back and forth and talking, but despite the\nfact that Green had demanded that Addis be brought out, Green initially ignored\nAddis. Green acknowledged Addis at 11:15 a.m., when the showers typically\nwere turned on. Green and Addis were standing by the showers, and Green shook\nhis hand and told him, “It‟s all right, Danny. Go ahead and play cards.” Addis\nthen walked to a card table and sat down to play pinochle with other inmates.\nAbout 10 or 15 minutes later, Green and defendant walked from the showers to the\ntable, talking back and forth. When they arrived at the table, defendant stood to\nthe left of Addis, and Green stood to the left of defendant. One or two minutes\nlater, Esqueda saw defendant make a sudden movement with his left hand to\nAddis‟s neck.\n        Another inmate, Ricky Rogers, who was playing at the same table, also\nobserved defendant approach and stand behind Addis. Rogers testified that\ndefendant and Addis had a friendly conversation about a third inmate. Rogers saw\ndefendant raise his arm “real fast,” and then heard a sound like a punch. Addis\nstood up from the table and put his hand to his neck. When he pulled his hand\naway, blood was streaming from his neck. He dropped to his knees and then fell\nover.\n        From the tower, Officer Esqueda also saw Addis reach for his neck and saw\nblood flowing from it. Esqueda ordered the inmates in the yard to get down on the\nground. Everyone complied except defendant and Green, who continued running\nacross the yard. Defendant and Green complied only after Esqueda fired a “gas\nlauncher” that shot a wooden baton block into the yard. When defendant went on\n\n                                          4\n\fthe ground, a weapon popped out of his left hand and landed in front of him. At\ntrial, the weapon was described as a stabbing instrument consisting of a sharpened\npiece of metal covered by a sheath made from cellophane and cardboard and\nwrapped with string.\n       Addis was removed from the yard bleeding profusely, and died en route to\nthe hospital. An autopsy established the cause of death was massive blood loss\ncaused by the severance of his jugular and subclavian veins. A great deal of force\nwas required to inflict the fatal wound.\n       After Addis was removed from the yard, correctional officers cleared it of\nthe inmates one at a time. The inmates remained prone until they were removed.\nDefendant‟s left hand and the stabbing instrument found near his hand were\nbloody. Defendant was giggling and laughing as he lay on the ground. Later he\nwas examined and photographed. He had blood on his left hand and boxer shorts,\nbut was uninjured. The stabbing instrument recovered near defendant was\nconsistent with a weapon that would inflict the fatal wound Addis received.\n       Ten days after defendant attacked Addis, he threatened to flood the tier\nwhere he was housed unless he was moved. The officer to whom he made the\nstatement told him he could not be moved because of the ongoing investigation\ninto Addis‟s killing. Defendant replied, “I killed him so I confess. The\ninvestigation is over.”\n       Defendant wrote two letters, one dated September 9, 1997, and the other\nSeptember 22, 1997, to Joseph Lowery, another NLR member imprisoned at\nCorcoran State Prison. Glen Willett, a prison gang expert testified that\ndefendant‟s use of certain phrases identified him as an NLR gang member and that\nother references were to the Addis homicide. The letters are described more fully\nbelow in connection with defendant‟s challenge to the letters‟ admission into\nevidence. (See post, pp. 34-40.)\n\n                                           5\n\f               b. Attack on Joseph Matthews (Count 3)\n       On September 18, 1997, Officers Lourenco and Perez were escorting\ninmate Joseph Matthews from the showers to his cell when defendant called out\nfrom his cell, “Joe, want a cigarette.” Matthews broke away from the officers and\nran toward defendant‟s cell. Matthews, whose hands were cuffed behind his back,\nturned his back toward defendant‟s cell door and put his hands at the porthole\nopening of the door, reaching for something. Neither officer saw any object being\ntransferred. A moment later, Matthews stepped away and said, “I‟m cut.”\nMatthews‟s back was bleeding from a deep gash 7 to 8 inches long and three-\nquarters of an inch wide. Within seconds after Matthews stepped away from the\ncell door, the officers heard the sound of defendant flushing the toilet. It was\nimpossible to retrieve items flushed down the toilet, but Jeffrey Killian, a medical\ntechnician on the floor, testified that Matthews‟s wound was inflicted with a razor.\nFourteen stitches were required to close Matthews‟s wound. Three weeks after the\nattack, Matthews told an investigator that defendant had pulled out a razor blade\nattached to a toothbrush which he used to attack Matthews, and then flushed the\nrazor down the toilet.\n\n               c. Custodial Possession of a Weapon (Count 4)\n       On October 15, 1997, officers entered defendant‟s cell, of which he was the\nsole occupant, to allow him out of the tier to exercise. When Officer Lopez\nopened defendant‟s cell door, a sharp metal object fell to the floor. Defendant\nsmiled and shrugged. The object was a one-inch long piece of metal, shaped like a\ndagger and known in prison as a “spearhead.” In a subsequent search of the cell,\nofficers also recovered a razor blade that had been removed from the disposable\nrazors given to inmates for shaving.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f               2. Defense Case\n       The defense conceded defendant‟s guilt on counts 3 and 4, the attack on\nMatthews and the possession of a weapon, and focused its efforts on counts 1\nand 2, the killing of Addis. With respect to the attack on Addis, the defense\nargued that defendant acted out of duress because he himself would have been\nkilled if he had not attacked Addis as ordered by Green and the NLR. As a\ncorollary, he maintained that the prison guards knew Addis was going to be\nattacked and allowed it to happen in retaliation for Addis‟s assault on a prison\nguard, thus foreclosing defendant from obtaining protection from prison\nauthorities. Defendant sought to establish his defense through the testimony of\nOfficer Rosamaria Maldonado, the guard who had expressed concern about\nAddis‟s safety to Sergeant Sams, and two prison experts. Defendant himself did\nnot testify.\n       By the time Rosamaria Maldonado testified, she had left the Department of\nCorrections after filing a stress claim seeking workers‟ compensation benefits. In\nthat claim, she cited the Addis killing, among other incidents, as contributing to\nher stress. With respect to the events of August 3, 1997, she testified that Green\nhad been insistent that Addis come out to the yard. She thought Addis might have\nsafety issues if he went out to the yard, and she told Addis, “You must be packing\nfor them because they‟re dying to see you.” By this, she meant that Addis must be\nconcealing drugs or weapons. He looked at her and smiled and she let him out\ninto the yard. After releasing Addis into the yard, Maldonado observed that Green\nmerely nodded and did not greet Addis as he usually did, with a hug and a kiss.\nWhen Maldonado walked back into the building, she told Sergeant Sams, “You\nknow, Sarge, they‟re going to take him out.” Sams responded, “Come on, we got\na lot of work to do.” She and Sams left the area to conduct cell searches. About\ntwo hours later, she heard a gas launcher in the exercise yard. She was one of the\n\n\n                                          7\n\fofficers who responded to the yard to help Addis. In addition, after he was carried\nout of the yard on a stretcher, she rode in the ambulance with him. Addis died as\nshe was performing CPR on him.\n       At trial, Maldonado denied the existence of any conspiracy between the\nguards and Green to kill Addis, and denied that her fear for Addis‟s safety was\nanything other than a “gut feeling.” She had previously been unaware that Addis\nhad been placed in ASU because he had hit a guard. However, according to Dr.\nDavid Friedman, from whom she sought counseling, Maldonado told him that they\nknew “an inmate was to be killed. We all knew it. I told the supervisor that he\nwould be killed if we let him out of his cell.” She also told Dr. Friedman that she\nhad told her sergeant, “They are going to kill him.”\n       Confronted with these statements at trial, Maldonado claimed that\nDr. Friedman had paraphrased what she told him, and that she did not make the\nstatements he attributed to her. She denied telling him “I tried to stop it,” or that\n“They killed him because they thought he was giving information to us, which he\nwas. He used to talk to [Officer] Kaffenberger a lot.” She similarly testified that\nstatements attributed to her by Dr. Donald Feldman, who examined her in\nconnection with her workers‟ compensation claim, were also paraphrases. In the\nstatements attributed to her by Dr. Feldman, she allegedly said she had told\nSergeant Sams an inmate was likely to be killed if they let him out of his cell, and\nthat Sams had shrugged.\n       The defense also called as a witness James Gleisinger, who assisted\nFreidman in worker‟s compensation evaluations. Gleisinger testified that he\ninterviewed Maldonado and set forth in his report Maldonado‟s verbatim\nstatements to him. Among the statements in his report were: “ „She recalls “the\nmost dramatic thing was about 18 months ago an inmate was to be killed. We all\nknew it. I told the supervisor that he would be killed if we let him out of his\n\n                                           8\n\fcell,” ‟ ” and “ „ “That inmate was let out even though everyone knew he would be\nkilled if he was let out. I tried to stop it. That could open up a big can of worms.\nI told my sergeant that they‟re going to kill him. [¶] „She states that Sergeant\nSams “shrugged his shoulders.” ‟ ”\n       Two prison experts testified for the defense. Steven Rigg, a 17-year\nveteran of the Department of Corrections, from which he had retired in 1998 as an\nacting captain, reviewed materials relevant to the attack on Addis and testified that\nthe guards had repeatedly mishandled the situation. In Rigg‟s opinion, Green\nshould have been removed from the yard and disciplined for causing a disturbance\nby demanding that Addis be brought out. Rigg also testified that the guards\nshould have known Green‟s demand that Addis be brought to the yard indicated\ntrouble because Addis was not an NLR member and had been moved to a different\ntier under circumstances that showed he was in trouble with the NLR. The fact\nthat Addis had stolen tobacco and “rolled off the tier” put him at risk. Rigg\ntestified that once Maldonado informed Sergeant Sams that “they‟re going to take\nhim out,” the tower guard should have been instructed to remove Addis from the\nyard. According to Rigg, the fact that Addis was yard eligible should not have\nprevented Sams from removing him from the yard once he received information\nthat Addis might be assaulted or killed. Rigg further testified that Green‟s initial\nfailure to greet Addis, followed by his attempt to engage him, showed a “setup.”\nUnder those circumstances, the tower guard should have ordered the inmates to\nthe ground and searched for weapons when he saw Green and defendant approach\nAddis as he was playing cards.\n       Rigg also testified about prison gangs generally. According to Rigg, if a\ngang member received an order from a gang leader to carry out an assault, he was\nexpected to do so. If he failed, the inmate would put himself at risk to be assaulted\nor killed. Further, after carrying out the assault, the gang would expect the inmate\n\n                                          9\n\fnot to show any concern for the victim. To do so would be considered a sign of\nweakness.\n       Applying these observations to defendant‟s situation, Rigg opined that, had\ndefendant failed to assault Addis, he would have been “a walking dead man.” He\ncould not have obtained assistance from the correctional staff without requesting\nprotective custody, and even in protective custody, inmates have been assaulted\nand killed. Moreover, Rigg testified, the sequence of events showed that Sergeant\nSams “possibly wanted [Addis] assaulted,” in that Sams failed to take action to\nprotect Addis. Furthermore, the light administrative punishment imposed on\nGreen for his involvement in the attack — a 360-day credit loss without a term in\nASU — showed, in effect, that the Department of Corrections “did not punish him\nfor being involved in the conspiracy as charged, yet they found him guilty.”2\n       Anthony L. Casas also testified as a prison expert. Casas had worked for\nover 22 years in the Department of Corrections, retiring as associate warden at San\nQuentin. He was particularly involved in dealing with prison gangs. Casas\ntestified that inmates become involved in prison gangs in various ways. A gang\nmay offer a new inmate protection in return for which the inmate will be expected\nto do the gang‟s bidding. If the inmate refuses, the gang will tell him he cannot\ndisrespect the gang after it helped him. While some inmates who are big and\n\n2       Sergeant Sams accused Green of involvement in a conspiracy to assault\nAddis, and of ordering the “hit” on Addis. The hearing officer found the\nallegations to be true. On Ocrober 10, 1997, Green was given a warning and a\nreprimand, and was assessed 360 days of credit. He was also referred to the\ninstitutional classification committee for a program review and to the Bureau of\nPrison Terms (now Board of Parole Hearings) regarding his rule violation.\nSergeant Sams did not recommend that Green be given a term in a security\nhousing unit or any other special type of confinement. Green was paroled on\nOctober 30, 1997, 20 days after this punishment was imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fstrong may be able to avoid gangs, someone like defendant, who is five feet six\ninches tall, and then weighed 150 pounds, might need the gang‟s protection.\nAdditionally, an inmate serving a long prison term will do what he can to be\nprotected in prison.\n          Casas testified that with most gangs, the only way out is death. If a gang\norders a member to commit a crime and he fails to do so, “[h]e can easily be\nkilled. As a matter of fact, in most cases where your gangs are disciplined enough,\nthat‟s precisely what happens . . . . You follow or you‟re gone.” Once an inmate\nhas carried out an order to commit an assault, he is expected to show pride and\nbrag about the crime. Any show of regret would be seen as a sign of weakness,\nand the inmate could be thrown out of the gang or killed. Casas testified further\nthat inmates observe staff. Based on his review of how staff handled Addis, Casas\nopined that an inmate would have concluded it was useless to rely on staff for\nsafety.\n          Like Rigg, Casas criticized the staff‟s handling of the situation in this case.\nHe agreed that once Sams had been warned by Maldonado about the danger to\nAddis, Addis and Green should have been removed from the yard and an\ninvestigation should have been conducted. Like Rigg, Casas testified that Addis‟s\nyard eligibility would not have prevented Sams from removing him from the yard\nonce Sams learned of the threat to Addis‟s safety.\n\n          B. Penalty Phase\n\n              1. Prosecution Case\n          The prosecution‟s penalty case in aggravation relied on multiple incidents\nof prior criminal activity by defendant involving “the use or attempted use of force\nor violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence.” (§ 190.3,\nfactor (b).) To that end, the prosecution presented evidence that, while in prison,\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fdefendant had committed multiple stabbings and attempted stabbings, and assaults\non staff. It also presented evidence of numerous instances of assault and of\npossession of a weapon, all of them independent of those in the current case,\nincluding eight occasions on which he possessed a weapon, four instances of\nstabbing another inmate and one attempted stabbing of another inmate, a battery\non an officer, and an assault on a staff member.\n       Additionally, the prosecutor‟s cross-examination of a defense witness\nbrought out details of defendant‟s juvenile criminal record, which included two\ntheft-related charges. The same witness also testified that when defendant was 19\nyears old, he pleaded guilty to three counts of residential burglary, one count of\nsecond degree burglary, and one count of grand theft of an automobile. In the\nsame proceeding, six other theft-related counts were dismissed. Defendant was\ncommitted to the California Youth Authority for these offenses. The jury also\nheard about defendant‟s plea to one count of escape from the California Youth\nAuthority, after which he was transferred to an adult prison.\n\n           2. Defense Case\n       As described by defendant in his appellate briefing, the defense case in\nmitigation “chronicled [defendant‟s] physical, sexual, and mental abuse as a child\nand the long-term consequences of those experiences, including posttraumatic\nstress disorder, multiple suicide attempts, schizoid personality disorder and bipolar\ndisorder. [Defendant] also presented evidence that his criminal activity in state\nprison resulted from the denial of adequate mental health care and treatment by\nprison staff.”\n       Testimony regarding defendant‟s family history was provided by his two\nmaternal aunts, his maternal grandparents and his father. Both of defendant‟s\nparents were deaf. His mother, Linda, was described as having severe “mental\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fproblems” that manifested themselves in the out-of-control behavior she displayed\nbeginning in adolescence. For example, between the ages of 11 and 13, she set “a\nlot” of fires, including to the garage and to curtains in the living room. She once\nthreatened one of her sisters with a knife. Later, she attacked a pregnant neighbor\nwith a knife while the woman was showering and her husband was mowing the\nlawn. After that incident, she was removed from her parents‟ home and lived in a\nseries of foster homes.\n       Linda married Gary Landry when she was 20 or 21. Their marriage was\nmarked by constant fighting over what Gary perceived as Linda‟s deficiencies as a\nwife and a mother. When Gary learned that Linda was having affairs with women,\nhe painted “bad wife” and “bad mother” on the walls of their residence. Linda\ndrew graphic pictures of women having sex with each other on the walls above\ndefendant‟s crib.\n       Neither parent nurtured or provided the basic necessities to defendant when\nhe was an infant and toddler. Gary was a hard worker, but when he got home\nfrom work, he ignored defendant and instead spent time with his friends in the\ngarage. Linda was a drug user and extremely neglectful mother. When members\nof her family would visit, they would discover defendant alone in his play pen,\nhoarse from crying and yelling. No one had responded to his cries. Linda‟s\nfamily installed a light-flickering system to alert her when defendant was crying.\nThe house was filthy and defendant crawled on a floor littered with broken glass\nand curdled milk. When he was old enough to walk, defendant would get out of\nhis crib and wander the neighborhood. His grandparents, who lived nearby, once\ndiscovered him asleep beneath their car. Another time, he was found scavenging\nfor food in the neighbor‟s garbage cans.\n       When defendant was four years old, he went to live with his grandparents.\nA year later, his mother regained custody, but a few months later she returned him\n\n                                           13\n\fto her parents permanently. When defendant first went to live with his\ngrandparents, he did not talk, but grunted and pointed. He had nightmares and\nhoarded food beneath his bed. When he returned to his grandparents, they took\nhim to mental health professionals because he seemed inaccessible. He continued\nto receive psychiatric care, including hospitalization, throughout his childhood and\nadolescence.\n         Nonetheless, defendant had problems outside the home, starting with being\ndisruptive in kindergarten. He was repeatedly suspended in high school. At 15\nyears old, he and a friend burglarized the friend‟s house. When he was 16 or 17\nyears old, he stole a car, after which he entered the juvenile justice system and\nnever again lived with his grandparents. He spent the rest of his adolescence at\nvarious juvenile camps from which he periodically attempted to escape. During\nthis period, defendant was diagnosed as suffering from atypical depression and\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for which he was medicated. It also\nemerged during his interviews with mental health professionals that he had been\nsexually abused by his father‟s best friend and by a friend of his mother‟s.\nDefendant was described by these mental health professionals as depressed and\nsuicidal. All of these issues were related to the trauma he suffered in his first four\nyears.\n         Defendant‟s adult criminal history began when, at 19 years old, he pleaded\nguilty to three counts of theft-related first degree residential burglary, one count of\ngrand theft auto, and one count of second degree commercial burglary. In lieu of\nprison, he was sent to the California Youth Authority where he was evaluated by\nJames Cueva, a casework specialist, who testified at defendant‟s trial. According\nto Cuevas, defendant was depressed and suicidal, and had no goals, plans, or\nexpectations for life. Cuevas recommended intensive treatment for defendant to\naddress his severe mental and emotional problems.\n\n                                          14\n\f       Dr. Joseph Lantz, a clinical psychologist, interviewed and tested defendant.\nHe reviewed statements by defendant‟s aunts and spoke to his grandparents.\nLantz testified that defendant‟s early years were akin to those of “a feral child,”\nand produced the mental problems that plagued him into adulthood. He diagnosed\ndefendant as suffering from “schizoid personality disorder,” which is characterized\nby a “marked detachment from relationships.” Victims of this disorder prefer\nsolitude to human contact and are easily manipulated by other people. Lantz\ntestified that, despite defendant‟s history, he was not “a character[o]logically\nviolent person.”\n       Dr. Frank Gawin, a psychiatrist, reviewed defendant‟s medical records and\nconcluded that defendant suffered from bipolar disorder. He testified that prison\nofficials were well aware that defendant suffered from this disorder as well as\nother emotional and psychological problems. Both defendant‟s grandmother and\ndefendant himself had written to prison officials and elected officials requesting\ntreatment for his mental health issues. According to Gawin, any treatment\ndefendant received was “entirely inadequate.”\n       Dr. Glenn Lipson, a forensic psychologist, testified about inmate mental\nhealth services in general, as well as defendant‟s particular case. He met with\ndefendant and also reviewed records related to his mental health and treatment in\ncustody. Lipson concluded defendant suffered from schizoid personality disorder\nand bipolar disorder. He testified that prison aggravated defendant‟s mental\ndisease, and he attributed defendant‟s acts of violence in prison to the “diathesis-\nstress model” of behavior, i.e., the violent and stressful atmosphere of\nincarceration pushed defendant, who already suffered from mental illness, “over\nthe edge.” Based on his review of defendant‟s prison records, Lipson testified that\nthe treatment defendant received failed to meet the standards required for inmate\nmental health services.\n\n                                          15\n\f       Finally, Anthony Casas, who had testified at the guilt phase, returned at the\npenalty phase to testify about conditions at Calipatria State Prison where\ndefendant‟s first violent actions occurred. He testified that prison was staffed by\ninexperienced guards and less-than-qualified supervisors. The prison developed a\nreputation as being violent and out of control. Casas also testified that in 2000 he\nattempted to broker a deal in which defendant would provide information about\nthe NLR to prison officials, but the officials concluded his information was stale.\nA similar deal with the Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to materialize\nbecause the San Bernardino District Attorney declined to participate.\n                             II. GUILT PHASE CLAIMS\n\n       A. Review of Sealed Records\n\n           1. Introduction\n       Defendant requests that this court review certain records to which the trial\ncourt denied him access in whole or in part following an in camera review, and\ndetermine whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying him discovery of\nthose records. The records fall into three categories: (1) the confidential\ncorrectional inmate files maintained by the Department of Corrections for Daniel\nAddis, Gary Green and defendant himself (the C-files); (2) the personnel files of\nCorrectional Officers Esqueda, Sams and Maldonado; and (3) additional medical\nand personnel files of Officer Maldonado pertaining to her medical retirement\nfrom the Department of Corrections.\n\n           2. Background\n\n               a. C-files\n       Before trial, defendant served a subpoena duces tecum on the Department\nof Corrections, in which he sought his own C-file. (§ 1326.) Thereafter, he filed a\npretrial motion for discovery in which he requested, among other things, the C-\n\n\n                                         16\n\ffiles for Green and Addis. (§ 1054 et seq.) Defendant argued that discovery of the\nC-files was necessary for him to determine whether the hearing officer who\nconducted Green‟s rules violation hearing arising out of his participation in the\nassault on Addis had relied upon “undisclosed sources.” He contended the files\nmight (1) contain information to support his duress defense; (2) lead to evidence\nthat correctional staff knew, or should have known, about the attack on Addis; and\n(3) disclose whether there were any internal investigations regarding the attack on\nAddis and if any correctional staff had been disciplined as a result of such\ninvestigations.\n       The Attorney General, representing the Custodian of Records for California\nState Prison at Corcoran, moved to quash the subpoena or, alternatively, for the\ncourt to conduct an in camera hearing to determine whether the files should be\ndisclosed. The Attorney General argued that the files were presumptively\nprivileged, and disclosure of them would be contrary to the public interest. (See\nEvid. Code, § 1040, subd. (b)(2) [a public entity may refuse to disclose\nconfidential information if “[d]isclosure of the information is against the public\ninterest because there is a necessity for preserving the confidentiality of the\ninformation that outweighs the necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice”].)\nHe asserted the discovery request was overbroad, and cited the need to protect\nindividuals, such as informants, who would be endangered if their identities were\ndisclosed. He further noted that if informants‟ identities were not kept\nconfidential, inmates would be reluctant to cooperate in investigations. Finally, he\nurged that to protect the privacy rights of prisoners, confidential information\nregarding prisoners should not be released indiscriminately.\n       The trial court agreed to examine the three C-files in camera before trial to\ndetermine what, if anything, in them was discoverable. Following its review, the\ncourt granted defendant partial access to all three C-files, most extensively those\n\n                                          17\n\fof Green, and to a lesser extent, defendant‟s own file. It disclosed a single page of\nAddis‟s file. During trial, defendant renewed his request to examine Addis‟s file\nafter the prosecution turned over to him an incident report detailing Addis‟s\nassault on a correctional officer. The trial court denied the request.\n\n                b. Officer Personnel Records\n       By subpoena duces tecum and an accompanying discovery motion,\ndefendant sought the personnel files of 14 correctional officers. Defendant sought\nmaterial from the files reflecting: (1) lack of credibility;\n(2) “dishonesty/untruthfulness/veracity/false arrest/conduct unbecoming an\nofficer/neglect of duty”; and (3) acts of moral turpitude. The Attorney General,\nrepresenting the California Department of Corrections, moved to quash the\nsubpoena. The trial court preliminarily granted the discovery motion as to\nOfficers Esqueda and Maldonado and Sergeant Sams. It denied the request for the\npersonnel files of the remaining 11 officers based on defendant‟s failure to meet\nthe threshold requirement of good cause for disclosure of police personnel records.\n(See Evid. Code, § 1043, subd. (b)(2); Garcia v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th\n63, 70-71.)3 The trial court later reviewed the personnel files of Esqueda,\nMaldonado and Sams and concluded they contained no discoverable material.\n\n                c. Records Related to Officer Maldonado’s Retirement\n       After the trial had commenced, the prosecutor informed defense counsel\nthat Officer Maldonado had retired a year after the assault on Addis because of\n“significant emotional and mental health issues” arising from her involvement in\nthat incident. Defendant then served subpoenas on the State Compensation\n\n3      On appeal, defendant does not argue the trial court erred in concluding he\nhad failed to show good cause for the personnel records of the other 11 officers.\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fInsurance Fund (SCIF) and the California Institution for Men (CIM), seeking\nrecords related to Maldonado‟s retirement from the Department of Corrections.\nThe Attorney General, representing the California Department of Corrections,\nopposed the discovery request, arguing that the records were part of Maldonado‟s\npolice personnel files as to which the court had already found no discoverable\nmaterial.\n       The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion. It stated it had received\nrecords from SCIF and CIM related to Maldonado‟s retirement. Additionally, the\nrecords of Dr. Friedman, the psychiatrist who examined Maldonado in connection\nwith her retirement, were produced by Dr. Friedman in response to a defense\nsubpoena. Following an in camera review of the records, the court allowed\ncounsel for both parties to copy any records from the Friedman file they found\nrelevant. It denied the discovery motion as to the SCIF and CIM records, finding\nthere was nothing relevant in those records that was not also contained in the\nFriedman file. Defendant later sought to discover records of an investigation into\nMaldonado‟s workers‟ compensation claim made by an entity called Singleton\nInvestigations at the request of the SCIF. The trial court reviewed the records and\nfound nothing discoverable.\n\n            3. Discussion\n       Evidence Code section 1040, subdivision (b)(2), authorizes the trial court to\ndecline to disclose confidential records maintained by a public entity when it finds\n“the necessity for preserving the confidentiality of the information . . . outweighs\nthe necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice.” (See People v. Suff (2014)\n58 Cal.4th 1013, 1059; People v. Avila (2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 606.) This\nprovision is applicable to prison inmate records. (Ochoa v. Superior Court (2011)\n199 Cal.App.4th 1274, 1281.) As the Ochoa court observed, the state has a valid\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\finterest in maintaining the confidentiality of such records to “(1) protect\nindividuals, including informants inside and outside of prison, (2) ensure\ninstitutional security, and (3) encourage candor and complete disclosure of\ninformation concerning inmates from both public officials and private citizens.”\n(Id. at p. 1280.) In addition, disclosure of police personnel records requires a\nthreshold showing of good cause after which the trial court “screen[s] law\nenforcement personnel files in camera for evidence that may be relevant to a\ncriminal defendant‟s defense.” (People v. Mooc (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1225.)\nIn either case, the trial court‟s ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (Avila, at\np. 607 [no abuse of discretion where trial court withheld access to a witness‟s\nparole records]; People v. Hughes (2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 330 [“A trial court‟s\nruling on a motion for access to law enforcement personnel records is subject to\nreview for abuse of discretion”].)\n       Defendant asks that we review all records not disclosed to him by the trial\ncourt — the C-file records of defendant, Addis and Green, the personnel records\nof Officers Esqueda and Maldonado and Sergeant Sams, and the files of SCIF,\nCIM and Singleton Investigations related to Maldonado‟s retirement — and assess\nwhether the trial court‟s rulings were proper. “Parties who challenge on appeal\ntrial court orders withholding information as privileged or otherwise\nnondiscoverable „must do the best they can with the information they have, and\nthe appellate court will fill the gap by objectively reviewing the whole record.‟ ”\n(People v. Price (1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 493.) We have reviewed the record and\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting disclosure of\nthe materials.\n       We also conclude that the trial court‟s inadvertent failure to provide\ndefendant with one document from Addis‟s C-file did not require the court to\nallow defendant to review Addis‟s entire C-file. As noted above, during trial,\n\n                                          20\n\fdefendant renewed his request for access to Addis‟s file after the prosecution\nturned over to the defense an incident report regarding Addis‟s assault on a\ncorrectional officer. According to the prosecution, it had obtained the document\nfrom the person who investigated the assault by Addis, but the prosecution\napparently did not realize the document was relevant until it heard defendant‟s\nopening statement, which reflected a theory that correctional officers were\ncomplicit in the attack on Addis. Because the trial court had also failed to disclose\nthe document, the defense asked to be allowed to review Addis‟s entire C-file to\nsee if it contained other relevant documents. The trial court responded that it had\nreviewed the file two more times, “page by page,” and had discovered that the\nincident report at issue had been attached to a different report that involved a\ndifferent incident. The court further stated that it found no other documents that\nwere discoverable, and it denied defendant‟s request. We find no abuse of\ndiscretion in the court‟s decision and, as noted above, we have reviewed the file\nand found no discoverable documents.\n       Finally, defendant requests that the court allow appellate counsel to review\nAddis‟s C-file in accordance with appellate counsel‟s duty to “preserve evidence\nthat comes to the attention of appellate counsel if that evidence appears relevant to\na potential habeas corpus investigation.” (Cal. Supreme Ct., Supreme Court\nPolicies Regarding Cases Arising from Judgments of Death (2008) policy 3, std.\n1-1.) We decline his request. The files are preserved in the appellate record.\n\n       B. Denial of Motion to Sever Counts\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\nmotion to sever counts 1 and 2 (the attack on Addis) from counts 3 (the attack on\nMatthews) and 4 (possession of a weapon by an inmate). He further contends the\ndenial of severance violated his rights to due process, a fair trial, a trial by jury,\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\fand reliable capital case proceedings. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th, & 14th Amends.;\nCal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, & 17.) His contentions are without\nmerit.\n         In the trial court, defendant argued that separate trials were required\nbecause (1) there was an absence of cross-admissible evidence between counts 1\nand 2 (the killing of Addis) and counts 3 and 4 (the attack on Matthews and the\ncustodial possession of a weapon); (2) the evidence supporting counts 3 and 4 was\nweaker than the evidence supporting counts 1 and 2; (3) consolidation would\ninhibit defendant‟s willingness to testify with respect to counts 1 and 2; (4) the\nEighth Amendment required heightened scrutiny of joinder because counts 1 and 2\nrendered him death eligible; and (5) judicial economy would be served by separate\ntrials because counts 3 and 4 involved distinct incidents and distinct evidence. At\ndefendant‟s request, the trial court also considered an in camera offer of proof\nregarding defendant‟s testimony and how consolidation might affect his\nwillingness to testify.\n         In denying the motion, the trial court found that defendant had failed to\nmake an adequate showing of a substantial danger of prejudice. The court found\nfurther that “the four charges involved conduct by the defendant while in prison in\nthe California Institution for Men within a two-month period. Each occurred at\n[the] Palm Hall unit of [the] California Institute for Men. [¶] The offenses are of\nthe same class of crime, either assaultive conduct by a prisoner or the possession\nof a prison-made weapon necessary to commit similar assaults. Each of the\noffenses involved prison-made weapons. Each of the assaults [was] committed\nwith prison-made weapons against fellow prisoners. None of the charges appear\nto be weak in relation to the other. And the prejudice to the defendant would be\nsmall.”\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\f       The joinder of charges is addressed in section 954: “An accusatory\npleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their\ncommission . . . or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or\noffenses, under separate counts . . . ; provided, that the court in which a case is\ntriable, in the interests of justice and for good cause shown, may in its discretion\norder that the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading be\ntried separately or divided into two or more groups and each of said groups tried\nseparately.” The legislative preference for consolidation under either of the two\ncircumstances set forth in section 954 is intended to promote judicial efficiency.\n(People v. Capistrano (2014) 59 Cal.4th 830, 851.)\n       Defendant presents two theories of error. First, he contends count 4 was\nnot properly joined with the first three counts because count 4, custodial\npossession of a weapon, did not involve assaultive conduct, and therefore was not\nof the same class as count 1 (premeditated murder) and counts 2 and 3 (assault by\na life prisoner). Second, he contends the trial court abused its discretion in\ndeclining to sever counts 1 and 2, which arose from the assault on Addis, from\ncounts 3 and 4, which arose from the assault on Matthews and the possession of a\nweapon.\n       Joinder of the four counts was proper because the counts were all of the\nsame class. “Offenses of the same class are offenses which possess common\ncharacteristics or attributes.” (People v. Smallwood (1986) 42 Cal.3d 415, 424,\nfn. 5; see People v. Kemp (1961) 55 Cal.2d 458, 476.) With respect to the joinder\nof count 4 to the other counts, the trial court noted that all four offenses occurred\nin the custodial context and involved a prison-made weapon. In addition, sections\n4500 (assault by a life prisoner) and 4502 (custodial possession of a weapon) serve\nan identical purpose — to prevent assaults by armed prisoners on prison staff and\nother inmates. (See People v. Custodio (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 807, 812 [“By\n\n                                          23\n\fprohibiting prison inmates from possessing any instrument or weapon of the kind\nspecified in the statute, section 4502, subdivision (a) is intended to protect inmates\nand correctional staff „from the peril of assaults with dangerous weapons\nperpetrated by armed prisoners‟ ”]; People v. Superior Court (Gaulden) (1977) 66\nCal.App.3d 773, 778 [“Section 4500 was enacted for the purpose of promoting\nprison safety by discouraging assaults by prison inmates”].) Therefore, despite the\nfact that section 4502 does not require an intent to use the weapon (People v.\nRodriguez (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 389, 395), that offense as charged shares\ncommon characteristics with the assaultive offenses charged in this case, and is,\ntherefore, of the same class.\n       Joinder was also proper because the offenses were “connected together in\ntheir commission.” (§ 954.) “[O]ffenses which are committed at different times\nand places against different victims are nevertheless „connected together in their\ncommission‟ when they are, as here, linked by a „ “common element of substantial\nimportance.” ‟ [Citations.]” (People v. Lucky (1988) 45 Cal.3d 259, 276.) Here,\nthe common thread among all four offenses is the use or possession by defendant\nof a prison-made stabbing weapon. Defendant contends the common element\nfactor requires that the same weapon be involved in each crime. We rejected a\nsimilar argument in Alcala v. Superior Court (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1205, in which the\ndefendant claimed “only physical or objectively measurable factors, such as use of\na specific individual weapon, can suffice” to establish the common element factor.\n(Id. at p. 1220.)\n       Accordingly, we conclude that count 4 was properly joined with the other\nthree offenses under section 954.\n       In addition, because the evidence that defendant committed count 4 was\nstrong and stood on its own without reference to the remaining counts, the\nevidence related to the other counts would not have improperly bolstered the\n\n                                         24\n\fevidence pertaining to count 4. In light of the strength of the evidence related to\neach charge, “we cannot conclude that it is reasonably probable an outcome more\nfavorable to defendant would have resulted” (People v. McLain (1988) 46 Cal.3d\n97, 106) if count 4 had not been joined with the other counts. For the same reason,\nany misjoinder did not result in such gross unfairness as to deprive defendant of\nhis right to due process. (People v. Soper (2009) 45 Cal.4th 759, 784 [“Appellate\ncourts have found „ “no prejudicial effect from joinder when the evidence of each\ncrime is simple and distinct, even though such evidence might not have been\nadmissible in separate trials” ‟ ”].)\n       As noted, defendant also contends the trial court abused its discretion by\nnot severing counts 3 and 4 from counts 1 and 2. When charges are properly\njoined, a “ „ “defendant must make a clear showing of prejudice to establish that\nthe trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant‟s severance motion.” ‟\n[Citation.] That is, defendant must demonstrate the denial of his motion exceeded\nthe bounds of reason.” (People v. Capistrano, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 848.)\n“ „Refusal to sever may be an abuse of discretion where (1) evidence of the crimes\nto be jointly tried would not be cross-admissible in separate trials; (2) certain of\nthe charges are unusually likely to inflame the jury against the defendant; (3) a\n“weak” case has been joined with a “strong” case or with another “weak” case, so\nthat the “spillover” effect of aggregate evidence on several charges might well\nalter the outcome of some or all of the charges; and (4) any one of the charges\ncarries the death penalty or joinder of them turns the matter into a capital case.‟ ”\n(People v. Romero and Self (2015) 62 Cal.4th 1, 30.) Even if a defendant fails to\ndemonstrate the trial court‟s joinder ruling was an abuse of discretion when it was\nmade, reversal may nonetheless be required if the defendant can demonstrate that\n“the joint trial resulted in such gross unfairness as to amount to a due process\nviolation.” (Capistrano, at p. 853.)\n\n                                          25\n\f       Applying the four-part standard outlined above, defendant first contends\nevidence was not cross-admissible among the four counts. The trial court did not\nexpressly refer to cross-admissibility in its ruling denying severance, but its\ncomments focused on the similarities among the counts — within a two and one-\nhalf month period, while housed in the Palm Hall unit of the CIM, defendant\ncommitted offenses involving prison-made weapons. As defendant acknowledges,\nthe trial court‟s ruling reflects the view that there was a common plan or scheme to\ncommit assaults with prison-made weapons.\n       To be admissible to prove a common plan or scheme, evidence of other\nmisconduct “must demonstrate „not merely a similarity in the results, but such a\nconcurrence of common features that the various acts are naturally to be explained\nas caused by a general plan of which they are the individual manifestations.‟ ”\n(People v. Ewoldt (1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 402.) The first three counts involved\nconduct to lull another inmate into a false sense of security followed by a surprise\nattack with a prison-made weapon. The fact that the attack on Addis occurred in\nthe exercise yard in front of numerous witnesses and seemed to involve Green in\nthe plan, whereas the attack on Matthews occurred while defendant was alone in\nhis cell and with no participation by any other inmate, does not negate the\nsignificant similarities. (See Alcala v. Superior Court, supra, 43 Cal.4th at\np. 1225 [the similarity required to admit evidence to prove a common plan “can be\nmet despite the existence of some factual differences between or among the\ncharged offenses”].) Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in implicitly\nfinding the evidence in these three counts to be cross-admissible. Like the other\nthree counts, count four involved the possession of a prison-made stabbing\nweapon. Therefore, the other counts were admissible to establish a common plan\nto possess a prison-made weapon such as the sharpened metal object that fell to\nthe floor when the gate to defendant‟s cell was opened.\n\n                                          26\n\f       In addition, as defendant concedes, “even the complete absence of cross-\nadmissibility does not, by itself, demonstrate prejudice from a failure to order a\nrequested severance.” (Alcala v. Superior Court, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1221.)\nRather, we look to the remaining three factors. (Ibid.) An examination of those\nfactors does not reveal an abuse of discretion.\n       First, none of the joined charges was unusually likely to inflame the jury\nagainst defendant. Defendant asserts the evidence of the attack on Matthews and\nthe possession of a weapon would lead the jury to infer improperly that defendant\n“had a general disposition to violence,” and would “undercut his defense of duress\nand staff complicity and/or negligence in the Addis homicide based on the facts\npeculiar to that case.” The fact that evidence of two violent crimes might lead a\njury to infer that a defendant is violent does not establish that any of the charges\nwere unusually likely to inflame the jury. In addition, to the extent defendant‟s\nattack on Matthews and his possession of a weapon tended to show he repeatedly\nacted pursuant to a common plan rather than due to duress or negligence, or with\nthe complicity of staff, such inferences were proper.4 Finally, as explained below,\nduress is not a defense to murder, nor does duress reduce murder to manslaughter.\n(See post, pp. 42-49.)\n\n\n4       Although it does not appear that the trial court was aware at the time it\nruled on the severance motion of what defenses, if any, defendant would present to\ncounts 3 and 4, we note, for purposes of evaluating whether the joint trial of these\ncharges resulted in gross unfairness, that the defense presented evidence at trial\nthat staff was complicit in the attack on Matthews. In particular, the defense\nelicited testimony from Matthews that he thought the officers allowed him to go to\ndefendant‟s cell and “put [him] in a position for it to happen,” and it presented\nexpert testimony concerning how the officers should have escorted Matthews so\nhe could not get away from them. Also, as noted above, the defense ultimately\nconceded guilt with respect to counts 3 and 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f       Second, counts 1 and 2 were not supported by evidence that was so\nmeasurably stronger than the evidence supporting counts three and four that it\nwould likely have had an improper spillover effect on counts 3 and 4. Defendant\ncontends the evidence of the attack on Addis was stronger because there were\neyewitnesses to it, but the circumstantial evidence that he attacked Matthews was\njust as strong. Defendant called him over, Matthews complied and turned his back\nto the porthole of defendant‟s cell door, and then Matthews staggered away from\ndefendant‟s cell bleeding while guards heard defendant evidently flushing his\nweapon down the toilet. Similarly, the discovery of a prison-made weapon in a\ncell solely occupied by defendant constituted strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe possessed that weapon.\n       Third, “[t]he capital charges were not the result of joinder of the various\nincidents.” (People v. Mendoza (2000) 24 Cal.4th 130, 162.) Contrary to\ndefendant‟s arguments, we do not apply a heightened standard in assessing\nseverance issues in capital cases. (People v. Trujeque (2015) 61 Cal.4th 227, 260.)\n       Defendant further contends that the trial court should have granted\nseverance because denial of the motion assertedly prevented him from taking the\nstand. He claims he could have offered a defense to the Addis counts that was\ninapplicable to the remaining counts, but would then have also had to testify\nconcerning the remaining counts.\n       Defendant‟s theory of prejudice has been recognized by federal courts in\ninterpreting their rule of procedure regarding severance, rule 14(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure (18 U.S.C.). We noted in People v. Sandoval (1992)\n4 Cal.4th 155, that we have not addressed this theory, and we concluded that the\n“[d]efendant‟s showing fell far short of anything that would have satisfied the\nfederal standards or any standard this court might adopt.” (Id. at p. 174.) We have\nsubsequently considered this theory without adopting it as part of our severance\n\n                                         28\n\fanalysis. (See People v. Johnson (2015) 61 Cal.4th 734, 752; People v. Thomas\n(2012) 53 Cal.4th 771, 800.) Although the federal courts‟ test is based on their\ninterpretation of the federal rule and is not grounded in constitutional mandate, we\nwill assume, without deciding, that the type of prejudice recognized by the federal\ncourts could justify a trial court‟s decision to sever otherwise properly joined\ncharges under California law.\n       Although federal courts have interpreted their rule to permit severance\nwhen a defendant can show prejudice because he or she “ „wishes to testify to one\ncharge but to remain silent on another‟ ” (U.S. v. Archer (7th Cir. 1988) 843 F.2d\n1019, 1022), they recognize that “ „severance is not mandatory every time a\ndefendant wishes to testify to one charge but to remain silent on another. If that\nwere the law, a court would be divested of all control over the matter of severance\nand the choice would be entrusted to the defendant.‟ ” (Ibid.) Under the two-part\ntest devised by the federal courts, “severance is required when a defendant\ndemonstrates that he has both (1) important testimony to give concerning some\ncounts and (2) a strong need to refrain from testifying with regard to other counts.”\n(U.S. v. Ely (7th Cir. 1990) 910 F.2d 455, 457, italics added.) To satisfy the\nsecond part of the test, the defendant must demonstrate that his or her testimony\non the counts about which he or she did not wish to testify was essential to the\nprosecution‟s meeting its burden of proof on those charges. (Id. at p. 460; Archer,\nat p. 1022; U.S. v. Williamson (5th Cir. 1973) 482 F.2d 508, 513.)\n       As noted, the trial court conducted an in camera hearing concerning\ndefendant‟s desire to testify about the Addis attacks and how consolidation might\naffect his willingness to testify. At defendant‟s request, we have reviewed the\nsealed transcript of that hearing. The People have asked that the transcript be\nunsealed in the event it appears the trial court abused its discretion in denying\nseverance. It is unnecessary to unseal the transcript, as defendant has failed to\n\n                                          29\n\fsatisfy the second part of the federal test. There was ample independent evidence\nof his attack on Matthews (count 3) and his possession of the prison-made weapon\n(count 4), quite apart from any testimony he may have offered or declined to offer\nregarding those counts. Accordingly, he fails to show he was prejudiced on this\nground by the trial court‟s denial of his severance motion.\n       Defendant makes several related arguments that can be quickly dispatched.\nFirst, he claims the trial court failed to instruct the jury to consider and decide each\ncount separately, but as he concedes, the trial court did not have a duty to give the\ninstruction without a request. (People v. Beagle (1972) 6 Cal.3d 441, 456.)\nSecond, he claims the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing that the jury\ncould indiscriminately use the evidence of all counts to prove each count. But\ndefendant neither objected to the argument, thus forfeiting any claim of\nmisconduct, nor did he request a limiting instruction. (People v. Lopez (2013) 56\nCal.4th 1028, 1073; Evid. Code, § 355.) Third, he claims judicial economy would\nhave been served by severing counts 1 and 2 from counts 3 and 4 because counts 3\nand 4 involved evidence that was not relevant to counts 1 and 2, and “there was\nevery reason to believe that a verdict on the capital/murder charges would have led\nthe parties to reach a disposition on other charges.” Evidence of the counts was\ncross-admissible, as explained above, and he cites no legal authority to support his\nnovel and speculative theory regarding a disposition of the less serious charges.\n       Finally, defendant contends denial of his severance motion resulted in such\ngross unfairness as to amount to a violation of his federal due process rights.\n(People v. Capistrano, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 853.) Other than the asserted\nprejudice we have already discussed and rejected, defendant points to no\nadditional unfairness assertedly resulting from the joint trial. We therefore\nconclude that defendant has failed to show a due process violation as the result of\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fthe denial of his severance motion, or any violation of his rights to a fair trial, a\ntrial by jury, and reliable capital case proceedings.\n\n       C. Juror Questionnaire\n       Defendant contends the trial court erroneously rejected two questions he\nasked to be included on the jury questionnaire pertaining to the prospective jurors‟\nattitudes about aspects of prison life. He contends the court‟s ruling violated his\nstate and federal rights to due process, a fair trial, an impartial jury, and to a\nreliable determination of guilt and penalty in a capital case. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th,\n8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, & 17.)5 The claim\nis meritless.\n\n\n\n\n5       “With respect to this and virtually every other claim raised on appeal,\ndefendant urges that the error or misconduct he is asserting infringed various of\nhis constitutional rights to a fair and reliable trial. In most instances, insofar as\ndefendant raised the issue at all in the trial court, he failed explicitly to make some\nor all of the constitutional arguments he now advances. In each instance, unless\notherwise indicated, it appears that either (1) the appellate claim is of a kind (e.g.,\nfailure to instruct sua sponte; erroneous instruction affecting defendant‟s\nsubstantial rights) that required no trial court action by the defendant to preserve it,\nor (2) the new arguments do not invoke facts or legal standards different from\nthose the trial court itself was asked to apply, but merely assert that the trial\ncourt‟s act or omission, insofar as wrong for the reasons actually presented to that\ncourt, had the additional legal consequence of violating the Constitution. To that\nextent, defendant‟s new constitutional arguments are not forfeited on appeal.”\n(People v. Boyer (2006) 38 Cal.4th 412, 441, fn. 17, applying People v. Partida\n(2005) 37 Cal.4th 428, 433-439.) “In the latter case, no separate constitutional\ndiscussion is required or provided where rejection of a claim that the trial court\nerred on the issue presented to that court necessarily leads to rejection of any\nconstitutional theory or „gloss‟ raised for the first time here.” (People v.\nContreras (2013) 58 Cal.4th 123, 139, fn. 17.) We apply this principle here and\nelsewhere where defendant asserts on appeal constitutional claims not advanced\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\f           1. Background\n       Defendant proposed the following multipart question (question No. 40) to\nbe included in the juror questionnaire:\n       “What are your views on the prison system in the State of California?\n       “A. To what extent can you consider evidence that living in the prison\nsystem, that is to say being a prisoner, is an ongoing experience entirely different\nfrom living in society as you know it?\n       “B. Please indicate which statement best describes your opinion of life in\nthe prison system prior to hearing evidence in this case:\n       “____ Prisoners are safer on the inside that they would be on the outside\n       “____ Prisoners are about as safe on the inside as they would be on the\noutside\n       “____ Prisoners are less safe on the inside than they would be on the\noutside\n       “C. Whatever your opinion as to the safety of living in the prison system\nmay be, how willing are you to consider evidence that many prisoners‟ primary\ntask on the inside is staying alive?”\n       The prosecutor objected to subparts B and C, asserting they were\nargumentative and called upon the prospective jurors to prejudge the case. The\nprosecutor also asserted that the questions were vague as to what was meant by\nprisoner safety. The trial court declined to include subparts B and C. Regarding\nthe latter, even defense counsel conceded it was a “little argumentative,” and\nproposed an alternative the trial court also declined to include. The court\nexpressed its belief that the defense could ask follow up questions to subpart A “to\nget somewhat the same information, assuming it‟s an appropriately asked\nquestion.” At the defense‟s request, a space was provided after subpart A with the\nwords “Please explain.” In its final form, subpart A (renumbered question No. 96,\n\n\n                                          32\n\fsubpart b on the questionnaire) read: “Would you be willing to consider evidence\nthat living in the prison system, that is to say, being a prisoner, is an ongoing\nexperience entirely different from living in society as you know it? Please\nexplain.”\n\n            2. Discussion\n       Defendant contends the trial court‟s rejection of his questions regarding\nprisoner safety denied him the opportunity to “expose juror bias about prison\ninmate safety and survival, to lay the foundation for challenges for cause, and to\nexplore prospective jurors[‟] views on issues related to the circumstances of the\ncharged capital offense that would be important to the decision of whether or not\nto impose the death penalty.” As explained below, we find no abuse of discretion.\n       Preliminarily, we dispose of the People‟s claim that defendant forfeited this\nissue because, after further discussion and further revision of the questionnaire,\ndefense counsel agreed the questionnaire could be used. By then, however, the\ntrial court had already rejected subparts B and C, and it would have been futile for\ndefense counsel to renew the argument. Accordingly, we find no forfeiture and\nproceed to the merits.\n       “There is no constitutional right to voir dire per se. Nor is there any\nconstitutional right to conduct voir dire in a particular manner. [Citation.] Rather,\nthe voir dire process serves as a means of implementing the defendant‟s Sixth\nAmendment right to an impartial jury. [Citations.] [¶] Consistent with applicable\nstatutory law, the trial court has wide latitude to decide the questions to be asked\non voir dire [citation], and to select the format in which such questioning occurs\n[citation]. The court likewise has broad discretion to contain voir dire within\nreasonable limits.” (People v. Contreras, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p.143; fn. omitted;\nsee Code Civ. Proc., § 223.) Thus, “ „ “content” questions,‟ even ones that might\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\fbe helpful, are not constitutionally required. [Citation.] To be an abuse of\ndiscretion, the trial court‟s failure to ask questions „must render the defendant‟s\ntrial fundamentally unfair.‟ [Citation.] „Such discretion is abused “if the\nquestioning is not reasonably sufficient to test the jury for bias or partiality.” ‟\n[Citation.]” (People v. Cleveland (2004) 32 Cal.4th 704, 737; see also People v.\nLeon (2015) 61 Cal.4th 569, 586.) It is not the purpose of voir dire to “ „educate\nthe jury panel to the particular facts of the case, to compel the jurors to commit\nthemselves to vote a particular way, to prejudice the jury for or against a particular\nparty, to argue the case, to indoctrinate the jury, or to instruct the jury in matters of\nlaw.‟ ” (People v. Crowe (1973) 8 Cal.3d 815, 824.)\n       As defendant asserts, the issue of inmate safety and survival was “central to\nthe defense to the capital/murder charges.” The principal purpose of the rejected\nquestions appears to have been to begin educating the jurors about the defense.\nMoreover, as the prosecutor pointed out, the rejected questions were vague in that\nthey did not specify what kind of threats to inmate safety and survival were at\nissue. This vagueness itself created an opening for defendant to fill in the blanks\nwith, again, the objective of previewing the defense and inviting agreement with\nhis view of inmate safety and survival. Finally, the trial court did not foreclose all\nquestioning on this subject, but indicated it would allow the defense to pursue the\nsubject should a prospective juror raise it in his or her answer to subpart A.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the trial court acted well within its discretion in\nrejecting the questions. We conclude further that the rejection of the proposed\nquestions did not implicate the issue of death-qualification voir dire. (See\nWainwright v. Witt (1985) 469 U.S. 412; Witherspoon v. Illinois (1968) 391 U.S.\n510; People v. Butler (2009) 46 Cal.4th 847, 859 [the purpose of Witherspoon-\nWitt voir dire is to determine only the views of prospective jurors about capital\npunishment].)\n\n                                           34\n\f       D. Admission of Defendant’s Letters\n       Defendant contends the admission of jailhouse letters he wrote to another\nNLR gang member violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due\nprocess, a fair trial, a trial by jury, and to reliable capital proceedings. (U.S.\nConst. 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16,\n17.) We disagree.\n\n           1. Background\n       Prison officials intercepted two letters defendant wrote to fellow NLR gang\nmember, Joseph Lowery, who had once been defendant‟s cellmate. The officials\nphotocopied the letters and then allowed them to be delivered to Lowery. The two\nletters were denominated People‟s exhibits Nos. 66 and 67. Exhibit No. 66\nconsisted of a photocopied envelope and a letter dated September 9, 1997, sent\nfrom CIM, at Chino, where defendant was then housed. The envelope had\ndefendant‟s name, prison number and address. Exhibit No. 67 was an undated\nphotocopied letter that was faxed to David Lacey, the investigating officer in this\ncase, at CIM from an Officer Harrison at Corcoran State Prison on December 22,\n1997, when defendant was housed at that institution. Glen Willett, the\nprosecution‟s prison gang expert, testified that prison authorities monitor prison\ngang members by intercepting their mail and reading it before passing it on.\nLacey testified that outgoing letters by inmates are not allowed to be sealed. First,\nthey are collected and read. If they contain information pertinent to an ongoing\ninvestigation, they are photocopied and the copies passed on to a supervisor.\nFinally, the original letters are delivered to their recipients. That was how Lacey\nobtained defendant‟s letters.\n       Willett, the prison gang expert, testified concerning the contents of the\nletters for purposes of identifying defendant as either an associate or a member of\nthe NLR. With respect to exhibit No. 66, he testified that Lowery was a known\n\n\n                                           35\n\fNLR gang member and that defendant‟s use of the phrase “dawg o‟ mine,” was an\nendearment used among gang members. He testified further that the sentence,\n“Yeah, this 187 kinda put me at ease, had to earn it,” meant that defendant had “to\nwork hard” to commit the “murder,” presumably the Addis homicide, and that\ncommitting the murder would elevate defendant‟s status with higher ranking NLR\ngang members like Lowery. With respect to exhibit No. 67, Willett testified\ndefendant had signed it with his gang moniker “Smurf,” and had made reference to\nbeing relocated. He testified the phrase “so the KGB has been befuddled once\nagain,” referred to prison authorities. He also noted defendant had again used the\ngang phrase “dawg o‟mine,” and well as the phrase “I hope this finds you in good\nhealth and strong mind,” which is a reference to racial purity. Defendant also\nreferred to Gary Green‟s gang moniker, “Mop,” and to an Aryan Brotherhood\ngang member named Joseph Hayes who was then incarcerated at Pelican Bay.6\nWillett also testified that defendant‟s use of the word “homeplate,” was another\ngang endearment that was the “same as „homey.‟ ”\n       Later in the trial, when the prosecutor moved for the admission of exhibit\nNos. 66 and 67, the defense objected that there was no foundation that defendant\nwrote them. The prosecutor responded that the evidence showed Lowery and\ndefendant were cellmates at one point, that defendant‟s prison number and address\nwere written on the envelope in exhibit No. 66, and that “these are self-\nauthenticating letters because of the content” and also because they were signed\nwith defendant‟s gang moniker Smurf. Defense counsel argued there was no\nevidence regarding how prison officials obtained the letters. The prosecutor\n\n\n6     Willett testified that the NLR had begun as a feeder gang to the Aryan\nBrotherhood.\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\fcountered that Lacey‟s testimony regarding the interception and copying of inmate\nletters provided a proper foundation. She acknowledged, however, that it was not\npossible to establish who had originally collected the letters. The trial court\nadmitted the letters.\n\n           2. Discussion\n       Defendant‟s argument regarding the admissibility of the letters is two-\npronged. First, he contends the letters were inadmissible under the secondary\nevidence rule codified in Evidence Code section 1521. Second, he argues the\nletters were not properly authenticated under Evidence Code section 1401.\n       Evidence Code section 1521 provides in part: “The content of a writing\nmay be proved by otherwise admissible secondary evidence. The court shall\nexclude secondary evidence of the content of writing if the court determines either\nof the following: [¶] (1) A genuine dispute exists concerning material terms of\nthe writing and justice requires the exclusion. [¶] (2) Admission of the secondary\nevidence would be unfair.” Enacted in 1998 — and thus applicable to defendant‟s\n2001 trial — the secondary evidence rule replaced the best evidence rule, which\nwas repealed. “Under the secondary evidence rule, the content of a writing may\nnow be proved either „by an otherwise admissible original‟ ([Evid. Code,] § 1520\nor by „otherwise admissible secondary evidence‟ ([Evid. Code,] § 1521, subd. (a);\n[citation]).” (People v. Goldsmith (2014) 59 Cal.4th 258, 269.)\n       Here, as noted, photocopies of the letters and the one envelope were\nadmitted rather than the originals because, as Lacey explained, once the\nphotocopies were made, the originals were delivered to their intended recipient.\nDefendant now asserts the admission of the copies was error. At no time did\ndefendant object to admission of the documents under the secondary evidence\nrule. Rather, his objection went to their authenticity.\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f       “ „As a general rule, “the failure to object to errors committed at trial\nrelieves the reviewing court of the obligation to consider those errors on appeal.”\n[Citation.] . . .‟ This rule applies equally to any claim on appeal that the evidence\nwas erroneously admitted, other than the stated rule for the objection at trial.”\n(People v. Kennedy (2005) 36 Cal.4th 595, 612; accord, Evid. Code, § 353.) This\nprinciple applies with particular force here, because before the trial court can\nexclude otherwise admissible secondary evidence, Evidence Code section 1521\nrequires the court to make specific factual determinations. These include whether\na genuine dispute exists concerning material terms of the writing, and whether\nadmission of the evidence would be unfair. The trial court cannot make such\nfindings if a party fails to make a proper, specific, and timely objection, nor can\nwe review the basis of the trial court‟s determination where no findings were made\ndue to defendant‟s failure to have lodged the appropriate objection. Therefore,\ncontrary to defendant‟s view, his various objections to Willett‟s interpretation of\ncertain phrases in the letters did not amount to a proper objection under the\nsecondary evidence rule. Accordingly, the claim is forfeited.\n       As noted above, defendant also contends the letters were not properly\nauthenticated. A writing that qualifies for admission under the secondary evidence\nrule must, nonetheless, be authenticated before it can be admitted. “The\nSecondary Evidence Rule does not „excuse[] compliance with [Evidence Code]\nSection 1401 (authentication).‟ ([Evid. Code] § 1521, subd.(c).) Thus, to be\n„otherwise admissible,‟ secondary evidence must be authenticated.” (People v.\nSkiles (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1178, 1187, fn. omitted; see Evid. Code § 1401, subd. (b)\n[“Authentication of a writing is required before secondary evidence of its content\nmay be received in evidence”].)\n       “Authentication is to be determined by the trial court as a preliminary fact\n([Evid. Code,] § 403, subd. (a)(3)) and is statutorily defined as „the introduction of\n\n                                          38\n\fevidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of\nthe evidence claims it is‟ or „the establishment of such facts by any other means\nprovided by law‟ ([Evid. Code,] § 1400).” (People v. Goldsmith, supra, 59\nCal.4th at p. 266.) “The means of authenticating a writing are not limited to those\nspecified in the Evidence Code. ([Evid. Code,] § 1410 [„[n]othing in this article\nshall be construed to limit the means by which a writing may be authenticated or\nproved‟]; [citation].) For example, a writing can be authenticated by\ncircumstantial evidence and by its contents.” (People v. Skiles, supra, 51 Cal.4th\nat p. 1187.)\n       The testimony of Glen Willett and Officer Lacey was sufficient to sustain\nthe trial court‟s finding of authenticity. Both men testified to the general protocol\nby which inmate letters are monitored and, when appropriate, copied and turned\nover to prison authorities as possible evidence in ongoing investigations.\nDefendant‟s letters were of obvious interest to Lacey, who was investigating\ndefendant‟s attack on Addis. The envelope that was part of exhibit No. 66 showed\nas its return address defendant‟s address, along with his inmate number, and was\nsent while he was at CIM. Similarly, exhibit No. 67, the letter faxed to Lacey in\nDecember 1997 from Corcoran State Prison, was written while defendant was\nhoused at that institution and refers to his having been relocated; he had in fact\nbeen transferred from CIM to Corcoran. The contents of the letter, about which\nWillett testified, lends further support for its authenticity. The reference to a\n“187,” that is, a murder, and the context in which the reference is made, are\ninferentially references to the attack on Addis by defendant, for which he is\nclaiming credit. Other references in the letters, to mutual acquaintances like Gary\nGreen and Joseph Hayes, and defendant‟s familiar tone with the recipient, Lowery,\nhis one-time cellmate, as well as his use of his own gang moniker, Smurf, also\nprovide circumstantial support that he authored the letters. (See Evid. Code,\n\n                                          39\n\f§ 1421: “A writing may be authenticated by evidence that the writing refers to or\nstates matters that are unlikely to be known to anyone other than the person who is\nclaimed by the proponent of the evidence to be the author of the writing.”)\n       Defendant argues that all of this information was known to individuals\nother than himself, making it possible that the letters were forged. However,\n“ „[a]s long as the evidence would support a finding of authenticity, the writing is\nadmissible. The fact conflicting inferences can be drawn regarding authenticity\ngoes to the document‟s weight as evidence, not its admissibility.‟ [Citation.]”\n(People v. Goldsmith, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 267.)\n       Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nadmitting exhibit Nos. 66 and 67 into evidence.\n\n       E. Excusal of Sick Juror\n       On the day set for closing arguments and instruction, the court, over\ndefendant‟s objection, excused a sick juror and seated an alternate. Defendant\ncontends the trial court‟s decision to replace the sick juror was an abuse of\ndiscretion and also violated his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair and\nimpartial jury trial and a reliable penalty determination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th\n& 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.) The claim is\nmeritless.\n\n             1. Background\n       On the morning of April 18, 2001, the day set for closing arguments and\ninstructions, the trial court informed counsel that Juror No. 10 had called in sick\nwith the flu. The court indicated it was inclined to replace the juror because the\n“flu that‟s going around does not seem to be something that will get well [sic] in a\nday or two.” Defense counsel requested and was granted a recess to review his\njury list and consult with defendant. When the proceedings resumed, defense\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\fcounsel objected to replacing the sick juror and asked the court to wait for a day to\nsee whether the juror had recovered. The prosecutor suggested the court speak to\nthe juror directly. With consent of both counsel, the trial court telephoned the\njuror and put her on speakerphone. The juror reported she had been vomiting all\nnight and did not anticipate recovering that week. The judge asked if she would\nbe available on Monday, to which she said yes, although she acknowledged she\nhad not been to the doctor.\n       After speaking to the juror, the court noted that a delay from Wednesday to\nMonday would result in the loss of three court days. Defense counsel stated “it‟s\nreasonable to wait for that person until Monday.” The trial court, however,\nexcused Juror No. 10 and replaced her with an alternate.\n\n            2. Discussion\n       Section 1089 states in pertinent part that “[i]f at any time, whether before or\nafter the final submission of the case to the jury, a juror . . . becomes ill . . . , the\ncourt may order the juror to be discharged” and replaced by an alternate juror.\n“We review such a decision for abuse of discretion.” (People v. Smith (2005) 35\nCal.4th 334, 348-349.) “The court‟s discretion is not unbounded: it must\ndetermine whether good cause exists to discharge the juror, and its reasons for\ndischarge must appear in the record as a demonstrable reality.” (People v. Roberts\n(1992) 2 Cal.4th 271, 325.) The trial judge is not required, however, to “elicit\nconclusive proof of the length of future incapacitation; judges are lawyers, not\ndoctors.” (People v. Duff (2014) 58 Cal.4th 527, 560, fn. omitted.) Nor must the\nincapacitation exceed a specific length of time. “[I]n the right circumstances, an\nabsence of a day or less may warrant excusal. [Citations.] Whether a juror‟s\nillness can best be accommodated by a continuance or replacement with an\nalternate is a matter committed to the trial court‟s discretion.” (Id. at pp. 560-561.)\n\n\n\n                                            41\n\f       Here, there is no dispute the juror was ill. Although she believed she might\nbe well the following Monday, five days and three court days later, this was\nmerely an estimate on her part. Meanwhile, as defendant acknowledges, the trial\nhad gone on for almost two months and was set to enter its final phase of closing\nargument and instruction on the day the juror called in sick. Whether, as he\ninsists, a three-day continuance would have been reasonable is not the question we\nmust answer. The question is whether, under these circumstances, the trial court‟s\ndecision to proceed with an alternate juror was an abuse of discretion. In light of\nthe uncertainty of the juror‟s prognosis and the crucial point at which the trial had\narrived, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n       F. Claims of Instructional Error\n\n           1. Instructions Regarding Duress\n       Defendant contends the trial court‟s denial of four proposed defense\ninstructions concerning duress violated his federal constitutional rights to due\nprocess, effective assistance of counsel and a reliable penalty determination. (U.S.\nConst., 5th, 6th, 8th and 14th Amends.) The claim is meritless.\n       The defense of duress is set forth in section 26, which states in relevant\npart: “All persons are capable of committing crimes except those belonging to the\nfollowing classes: [¶] . . . [¶] Six — Persons (unless the crime be punishable\nwith death) who committed the act or made the omission charged under threats or\nmenaces sufficient to show that they had reasonable cause to and did believe their\nlives would be endangered if they refused.” As noted above, defendant argued\nthat his attack on Addis, the basis of counts 1 and 2, was committed under duress\nbecause the attack was ordered by the NLR and, had defendant failed to carry it\nout, he himself would have been killed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f       To establish the defense, defendant requested four duress instructions, two\npertaining to the first degree murder charge (count 1) and two to the charge of\nassault by a life prisoner with malice aforethought (count 2.)7 The trial court\n\n7       The four requested instructions were as follows:\n        1. “In this case, you may consider evidence showing the existence of threats,\nmenaces or compulsion that played a part in inducing the unlawful killing of a human\nbeing for such bearing as it may have on the question of whether the murder alleged\nin Count 1 was of the first or second degree. If you find from the evidence that at the\ntime the alleged crime was committed the defendant honestly and reasonably held a\nbelief that his own life was in danger, you must consider what effect, if any, this\nbelief had on the defendant and whether he formed any of the specific mental states\nthat are essential elements of murder. [¶] Thus if you find he had an honestly and\nreasonably held belief that his life was in peril and as a result did not maturely and\nmeaningfully premeditate, deliberate and reflect on the gravity of his contemplated\nact or form an intent to kill, you cannot find him guilty of a willful, deliberate and\npremeditated murder of the first degree.” [¶] Also, if you find the defendant did not\nform the mental state constituting express malice, you cannot find him guilty of\nmurder of either the first or second degree. You may however, find him guilty of the\ncrime of voluntary manslaughter as defined in these instructions.”\n        2. “The distinction between murder and manslaughter is that murder requires\nmalice while manslaughter does not. [¶] When the act causing death, though\nunlawful, is done under the actual and reasonable belief in the necessity to act\nbecause of imminent peril to life or great bodily injury, the offense is manslaughter.\nIn that case, even if an intent to kill exists, the law is that malice, which is an essential\nelement of murder, is absent. [¶] To establish that a killing is murder and not\nmanslaughter, the burden is on the People to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of\nthe elements of murder and that the act which caused death was not done under the\nactual and reasonable belief in the necessity to act because of imminent peril to life or\ngreat bodily injury.”\n        3. “With respect to Count 2, the crime of Assault By A Life Prisoner With\nMalice Aforethought is not committed unless the element of malice aforethought is\nproved. [¶] If you find that the defendant acted under the actual and reasonable\nbelief in the necessity to act because of imminent peril to life or great bodily injury,\nthere is no malice aforethought and the crime alleged in Count 2 is not committed.\n[¶] As to this alleged offense, the burden is on the People to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt each of the elements of the offense and that the act which caused\ndeath was not done under the actual and reasonable belief in the necessity to act\nbecause of imminent peril to life or great bodily injury.”\n        4. “In this case, you may consider evidence showing the existence of\nthreats, menaces or compulsion that played a part in inducing the unlawful assault\n                                                                (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                             43\n\frejected the instructions on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that\ndefendant personally entertained a good faith belief that his action — attacking\nAddis — was necessary because his own life was in danger.\n        Nonetheless, in response to the prosecutor‟s request that the court “say\nsomething about” duress, the court gave a modified version of CALJIC No. 4.40\n(Threats and Menaces) as follows: “A person is not guilty of a crime other than\nAssault by a Life Prisoner as alleged in Count 2 when he engages in conduct,\notherwise criminal, when acting under threat and menace under the following\ncircumstances: [¶] 1. Where the threat and menace are such that they would cause\na reasonable person to fear that his life would be in immediate danger if he did not\nengage in the conduct charged, and [¶] 2. If this person then believed that his life\nwas so endangered. [¶] This rule does not apply to threats, menaces, and fear of\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nupon inmate Addis resulting in death of the inmate as alleged in Count 2, for such\nbearing as it may have on the question of whether that crime was committed. If\nyou find from the evidence that at the time the alleged crime was committed the\ndefendant honestly and reasonably held a belief that his own life was in danger,\nyou must consider what effect, if any, this belief had on the defendant and whether\nhe formed any of the specific mental states that are essential elements of this\nparticular crime. Thus if you find he had an honestly and reasonably held belief\nthat his life was in peril and as a result did not form the mental state constituting\nmalice aforethought, which is an element of the crime, you may not find him\nguilty of said crime. [¶] You may however, find him guilty of the crime of any\nlesser included offenses such as assault with a deadly weapon as defined in these\ninstructions.”\n        Defendant acknowledges the proposed instructions are erroneous in two\nrespects: first, the requirement that a defendant maturely and meaningfully reflect\nupon his or her act had been eliminated from section 189 prior to defendant‟s trial\nand, second, the instruction erroneously stated express malice was required for\nmurder when section 189 states that such malice may be either express or implied.\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\ffuture danger to his life, nor does it apply to the crime of Assault By a Life\nPrisoner as alleged in Count 2.”8\n       We need not decide whether the trial court was correct that there was\ninsufficient evidence to support the requested instructions, because we have since\nheld that duress is not a defense to murder, nor does duress reduce murder to\nmanslaughter. (People v. Anderson (2002) 28 Cal.4th 767, 772-785 (Anderson);\nsee People v. Burney (2009) 47 Cal.4th 203, 249-250; People v. Hinton (2006) 37\nCal.4th 839, 882-883; People v. Wilson (2005) 36 Cal.4th 309, 331-332; People v.\nMaury (2003) 30 Cal.4th 342, 421-422.)\n       In Anderson, supra, 28 Cal.4th 767, the defendant urged the court to\nconstrue section 26 to exempt only capital crimes from the defense of duress. In\nresponse, we noted that at common law, duress was not a defense to killing an\ninnocent person. (Id. at p. 772.) We further observed that when California\nrecognized the defense in 1850, all murder was punishable by death. We\nconcluded that as enacted, “section 26 effectively adopted the common law”\n(Anderson, supra, at p. 774), thereby barring duress as a defense to murder. In the\ncourse of our discussion, we observed that “[i]f duress is recognized as a defense\nto the killing of innocents, then a street or prison gang need only create an internal\n\n8       The instruction‟s exclusion of the crime of assault by a life prisoner reflects\nsection 26‟s exclusion of “crime[s] punishable by death” from the defense of\nduress. (See § 4500.) In the trial court, defense counsel acknowledged that his\nproposed instructions on the effect of duress on count 2, which charged assault by\na life prisoner in violation of section 4500, was foreclosed by the explicit language\nof section 26. For this reason, we reject defendant‟s claim that the trial court erred\nin failing to instruct that duress could serve as a basis for the jury to reduce count\n2 to assault with a deadly weapon. For this purpose, we assume, without deciding,\nthat defense counsel‟s acknowledgement that section 26 did not apply to count 2,\nand his agreement to the modified duress instruction given, which specifically\nexcluded count 2, did not forfeit the claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\freign of terror and murder can be justified, at least by the actual killer.” (Id. at\np. 777, italics added.)\n       We also rejected the defendant‟s theory that even if duress is not a complete\ndefense to murder, “at least it reduces the crime to manslaughter by negating\nmalice.” (Anderson, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 781.) We noted that for purposes of\nvoluntary manslaughter — an unlawful killing without malice — the absence of\nmalice is limited to two circumstances: “ „ “when the defendant acts in a „sudden\nquarrel or heat of passion‟ (§ 192, subd. (a)), or when the defendant kills in\n„unreasonable self-defense‟ — the unreasonable but good faith belief in having to\nact in self-defense [citations].” ‟ ” (Ibid.) We observed that “[n]either of these\ntwo circumstances describes the killing of an innocent person under duress.”\n(Ibid.) We declined to carve out a third circumstance negating malice, based on\nduress. Unlike a person who has an unreasonable belief it is necessary to kill in\nself-defense, and therefore intends to kill lawfully, “a person who kills an innocent\nbelieving it necessary to save the killer‟s own life intends to kill unlawfully, not\nlawfully.” (Id. at p. 783.) We recognized that policy arguments could be made to\nrecognize duress as a factor reducing culpability, but observed that “because\nduress can often arise in a criminal gang context, the Legislature might be\nreluctant to do anything to reduce the current law‟s deterrent effect on gang\nviolence. These policy questions are for the Legislature, not a court, to decide.”\n(Id. at p. 784.) Defendant sets forth no argument that persuades us to reconsider\nthese conclusions.\n       Defendant seeks to avoid Anderson‟s holding on the basis that Anderson\ndid not consider whether duress may be a defense to murder as a matter of federal\nconstitutional law. He maintains that evolving standards of decency and\nheightened requirements of a reliable death penalty pursuant to the Eighth\nAmendment require recognition of duress as a defense to murder. Defendant does\n\n                                           46\n\fnot cite any case that has so held, and we are not persuaded that his citation to\nlegal commenters represents a national consensus that has developed against the\nrule we announced in Anderson. (Cf. Atkins v. Virginia (2002) 536 U.S. 304, 313-\n317 [tracing legislative actions prohibiting the execution of intellectually disabled\npersons as evidence of a national consensus against that practice].)\n       Defendant also asserts that his federal constitutional rights to due process\nand to present a defense required the trial court to give his proposed instructions\nand allow the jury to consider whether his claim of duress created a reasonable\ndoubt regarding malice. The high court has acknowledged, however, that “dealing\nwith crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal\ngovernment, [citation], and [it] should not lightly construe the Constitution so as to\nintrude upon the administration of justice by the individual States. (Patterson v.\nNew York (1977) 432 U.S. 197, 201 [New York statute allocating burden on\ndefendant to prove affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance does not\nviolate the due process clause].) “When a State‟s power to define criminal\nconduct is challenged under the Due Process Clause, we inquire only whether the\nlaw „offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of\nour people as to be ranked as fundamental.‟ [Citation.]” (Montana v. Egelhoff\n(1996) 518 U.S. 37, 58 (conc. opn. of Ginsberg, J.) [Montana statute eliminating\nvoluntary intoxication as a defense does not violate due process].)\n       Consistent with these principles, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit rejected a claim that Louisiana‟s statute excluding duress as a defense\nto murder violated the defendant‟s federal due process rights.9 “The state\n\n9      The Louisiana statute permits a justification defense “[w]hen any crime,\nexcept murder, is committed through the compulsion of threats by another of death\nor great bodily harm, and the offender reasonably believes the person making the\n                                                           (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                         47\n\flegislatures have vast powers to establish the elements of crimes, subject to the\nsubstantive provisions of the Constitution. [Citations.] Where a fundamental right\nis involved, the state‟s legislative authority must yield. [Citation.] Obviously,\nthere is no fundamental right to commit murder, even under duress. Substantive\ndue process is not implicated.” (Glass v. Blackburn (5th Cir. 1986) 791 F.2d\n1165, 1171.)\n        As we noted in Anderson, section 26 represents a legislative decision to\nadopt the common rule excluding duress as a defense to murder. (Anderson,\nsupra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 774.) California‟s position is consistent with the majority\nof states that have considered the issue and adopted the common law rule. (U.S. v.\nLaFleur (9th Cir. 1992) 971 F.2d 200, 205, and statutes and cases cited therein.)\nThe Legislature‟s adoption of the venerable common rule excluding duress as a\ndefense to murder does not implicate a fundamental right. Accordingly, we reject\ndefendant‟s claim that federal constitutional law required the trial court to give the\nrequested instructions.\n        Finally, defendant contends the trial court should have instructed the jury\nthat evidence of duress could negate premeditation and deliberation, thereby\nresulting in second degree murder. (See Anderson, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 784\n[“We agree that a killing under duress, like any killing, may or may not be\npremeditated, depending on the circumstances”].) In Anderson, we concluded this\nconcept was sufficiently addressed by language in CALJIC No. 8.20 (Deliberate\nand Premeditated Murder) instructing the jury that “a killing „upon a sudden heat\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nthreats is present and would immediately carry out the threats if the crime were not\ncommitted . . . .” (La. Rev. Stat. § 14:18(6) available from La. State Legis. Online\nat https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78335 [as of December 12, 2016].)\n\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fof passion or other condition precluding the idea of deliberation‟ would not be\npremeditated first degree murder.” (Anderson, supra, at p. 784.) Not only was\nCALJIC No. 8.20 given in this case, but, as noted, defendant received the\nunwarranted benefit of a modified duress instruction. We reject defendant‟s\ncontention that these instructions were inadequate on this point.\n\n           2. CALJIC No. 8.20\n       Defendant contends that the use of the word “precluding” in CALJIC\nNo. 8.20 (Deliberate and Premeditated Murder) in referring to circumstances that\nwould negate the element of deliberation effectively lowered the prosecution‟s\nburden of proof and violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due\nprocess, trial by jury and a reliable penalty determination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th,\n8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.)\n       As given in this case, CALJIC No. 8.20 provided:\n       “All murder which is perpetrated by any kind of willful, deliberate and\npremeditated killing with express malice aforethought is murder of the first\ndegree. The word „willful,‟ as used in this instruction, means intentional. [¶] The\nword „deliberate‟ means formed or arrived at or determined upon as a result of\ncareful thought and weighing of considerations for and against the proposed\ncourse of action. The word „premeditated‟ means considered beforehand. [¶] If\nyou find that the killing was preceded and accompanied by a clear, deliberate\nintent on the part of the defendant to kill, which was the result of deliberation and\npremeditation, so that it must have been formed upon pre-existing reflection and\nnot under a sudden heat of passion or other condition precluding the idea of\ndeliberation, it is murder of the first degree.” (Italics added.)\n       Defendant contends that, in context, the instruction required the jury to find\nevidence that would have entirely prevented deliberation before the jury could find\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\fthe crime to be less than first degree murder, a more onerous standard than\nrequiring merely that the evidence raise a reasonable doubt. He asserts: “The jury\nshould have been instructed that, if it found evidence of a sudden heat of passion\nor other condition sufficient to giv[e] rise to a reasonable doubt of deliberation, it\nmust give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty of first\ndegree murder.” He relies on various legislative, dictionary and judicial usages of\nthe word “precluding” to support his view that the jury would have understood the\nword to mean “prevent entirely.”\n       The People respond that the claim is forfeited by defendant‟s failure to seek\nmodification of the instruction or by his attorney‟s agreement to the instruction.\nAssuming defendant‟s argument challenges the correctness of the instruction and\ntherefore is not forfeited (see § 1259), it is nonetheless meritless.10\n       As defendant acknowledges, we have previously considered and rejected an\nidentical challenge to CALJIC No. 8.20. In People v. Nakahara (2003) 30 Cal.4th\n705 (Nakahara), the defendant contended that the word “precluding” in CALJIC\nNo. 8.20 was “too strong and could be interpreted as requiring him to absolutely\npreclude the possibility of deliberation, as opposed to merely raising a reasonable\ndoubt on that issue.” (Nakahara at p. 715.) We concluded that “this instruction is\nunobjectionable when, as here, it is accompanied by the usual instructions on\nreasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence, and the People‟s burden of proof.\nThese instructions make it clear that a defendant is not required to absolutely\npreclude the element of deliberation.” (Ibid.; accord, People v. Pearson (2012) 53\nCal.4th 306, 326; People v. Morgan (2007) 42 Cal.4th 593, 620-621.)\n\n10     Pursuant to section 1259, an appellate court may “review any instruction\ngiven, refused or modified, even though no objection was made thereto in the\nlower court, if the substantial rights of the defendant were affected thereby.”\n\n\n\n                                          50\n\f       Defendant asserts that Nakahara should not control because it did not\nconsider the various usages of “precluding” that he presents here and that he has\ndrawn from sources other than jury instructions. In considering a claim of\ninstructional error, however, we do not look far and wide for all possible usages of\na word the defendant has singled out as error nor do we focus solely on that single\nword. Rather, “[t]he relevant inquiry here is whether, „in the context of the\ninstructions as a whole and the trial record, there is a reasonable likelihood that the\njury was misled to defendant‟s prejudice.‟ [Citation.] Also, „ “ „we must assume\nthat jurors are intelligent persons and capable of understanding and correlating all\njury instructions which are given.‟ [Citation].” ‟ ” (People v. Sattiewhite (2014)\n59 Cal.4th 446, 475.) This was the standard we applied in Nakahara as is evident\nby our references to the others instructions pertinent to CALJIC 8.20. We apply\nthe same standard here and again reject this challenge to CALJIC No. 8.20.\n\n           3. Implied Malice Second Degree Murder Instruction\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury, on its\nown motion, concerning the lesser included offense of implied malice second\ndegree murder.11 He asserts the error violated his rights to due process and a trial\nby jury, and the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. (U.S. Const.,\n5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.) We find no error.\n\n11      Defendant contends the trial court should have instructed the jury with\nCALJIC No. 8.31 (Second Degree Murder — Killing Resulting From Unlawful\nAct Dangerous To Life), as follows:\n        “Murder of the second degree is also the unlawful killing of a human being\nwhen: [¶] 1. The killing resulted from an intentional act, [¶] 2. The natural\nconsequences of the act are dangerous to human life, and [¶] 3. The act was\ndeliberately performed with knowledge of the danger to, and with conscious\ndisregard for, human life. [¶] When the killing is the direct result of such an act,\nit is not necessary to prove that the defendant intended that the act would result in\nthe death of a human being.” (CALJIC No. 8.31.)\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\f       “A trial court has a sua sponte duty to „instruct on a lesser offense\nnecessarily included in the charged offense if there is substantial evidence the\ndefendant is guilty only of the lesser.‟ [Citation.] Substantial evidence in this\ncontext is evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the\ndefendant committed the lesser, but not the greater, offense. „The rule‟s purpose\nis . . . to assure, in the interest of justice, the most accurate possible verdict\nencompassed by the charge and supported by the evidence.‟ [Citation.] In light of\nthis purpose, the court need instruct the jury on a lesser included offense only\n„[w]hen there is substantial evidence that an element of the charged offense is\nmissing, but that the accused is guilty of‟ the lesser offense.” (People v. Shockley\n(2013) 58 Cal.4th 400, 403-404, italics added.)\n       A finding of express malice requires evidence of an intent to kill, whereas a\nfinding of implied malice requires only an “intent to do an act dangerous to human\nlife with conscious disregard of its danger.” (People v. Breverman (1998) 19\nCal.4th 142, 188.) Here, there is no substantial evidence that defendant intended\nonly to commit an action that was dangerous to human life, and did not intend to\nkill. The evidence reflects that Gary Green ordered a hit on Addis, and defendant\ncontended at trial that if he had not carried out the hit, he would have been killed.\nAfter Green demanded that Addis be let into the yard, Green and defendant\nwalked around together in the yard and ignored Addis. Thereafter, defendant told\nAddis, “It‟s all right, Danny. Go ahead and play cards.” Ten or 15 minutes later,\nGreen and defendant walked together to the card table, and defendant stood to the\nleft of Addis. One or two minutes after that, defendant, with one strong blow to\nAddis‟s neck, severed his jugular and subclavian veins. In a letter to another gang\nmember, defendant stated that he had to work to earn this murder, and that\ncommitting the murder would elevate his status with higher ranking NLR gang\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\fmembers. These facts reflect an intent to kill, and cannot be construed to reflect\nonly an intent to commit a dangerous act with conscious disregard of its danger.\n       Defendant directs us to cases in which courts found sufficient evidence of\nimplied malice based on an assault with a knife. (see, e.g., People v. Pacheco\n(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 617, 627.) He also points to evidence that he and Addis\nwere “having words” just before defendant stabbed him, and that Addis had\npreviously threatened harm to defendant. Although it is true that an assault with a\nknife may reflect implied malice, the issue here is whether there is substantial\nevidence that defendant acted with only a conscious disregard for human life. He\ndoes not explain how the evidence he cites — his use of a knife, “words” before\nthe assault, and a threat on some prior occasion — constituted substantial evidence\nthat he acted only with conscious disregard for human life. On the contrary, all of\nthe relevant evidence reflects an intent to kill.\n\n            4. Voluntary Manslaughter Instruction\n       As previously noted, defendant requested voluntary manslaughter\ninstructions on a duress theory that the trial court rejected. On appeal, he contends\nthe trial court had a duty to instruct the jury, on its own motion, regarding three\nother theories of voluntary manslaughter: sudden quarrel or heat of passion;\nimperfect self-defense; and assault with a deadly weapon without malice\naforethought. He claims the trial court‟s failure to do so violated his state and\nconstitutional rights to due process, trial by jury, a fair trial, and a reliable penalty\ndetermination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const. art. I, §§ 7,\nsubd. (a), 15, 16.) The claim is meritless.\n       As noted above in our discussion of defendant‟s claim of instructional error\nregarding duress (ante, pp. 42-49), the element of malice may be negated by\nevidence that (1) the defendant acted in a sudden quarrel or heat of passion, or (2)\n\n\n\n                                           53\n\fthe defendant unreasonably but in good faith believed it was necessary to act in\nself-defense. If either of these circumstances is found, an unlawful killing will be\nvoluntary manslaughter rather than murder. “Only these circumstances negate\nmalice when a defendant intends to kill.” (People v. Manriquez (2005) 37 Cal.4th\n547, 583.)\n       The heat of passion sufficient to reduce murder to manslaughter “exists\nonly where „the killer‟s reason was actually obscured as a result of a strong\npassion aroused by a “provocation” sufficient to cause an “ „ordinary [person] of\naverage disposition . . . to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection, and\nfrom this passion rather than from judgment.‟ ” ‟ ” (People v. Carasi (2008) 44\nCal.4th 1263, 1306.) The belief required to support imperfect self-defense is that\nthe defendant “was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury.” (People\nv. Booker (2011) 51 Cal.4th 141, 182.) This doctrine is a “ „narrow‟ ” one and\n“will apply only when the defendant has an actual belief in the need for self-\ndefense and only when the defendant fears immediate harm that „ “ „must be\ninstantly dealt with.‟ ” ‟ ” (People v. Rogers (2006) 39 Cal.4th 826, 883.)\n       A trial court must instruct a jury regarding lesser included offenses\n“ „ “whenever evidence that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense is\n„substantial enough to merit consideration‟ by the jury [Citations.] „Substantial\nevidence‟ in this context is „ “evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable\n[persons] could . . . conclude[]” ‟ that the lesser offense, but not the greater was\ncommitted.” ‟ ” (People v. Sattiewhite, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 477.)\n       Defendant identifies the same evidence to support each of these two\ntheories of voluntary manslaughter. First, Richard Allen, a former inmate,\ntestified that he heard defendant and Addis “having words” just before the fatal\nattack. Second, one of defendant‟s letters to Joseph Lowery included a statement\nthat the victim had decided to “disrespect me, and threaten harm to me” and “to\n\n                                          54\n\fkill me on the yard.” Undermining this evidence, however, is the fact that Allen\nalso testified that the victim, who was seated at a table playing cards when\ndefendant approached him from behind, did not threaten defendant. Furthermore,\nAllen‟s belief that the two were arguing was based solely on the tone of\ndefendant‟s voice, which “sounded angry.” Finally, Allen did not hear what the\ntwo men were saying to each other. Regarding the letter, defendant did not\nidentify when the alleged threat occurred. This evidence, even if credited, does\nnot begin to demonstrate either provocation for purposes of heat of passion\nvoluntary manslaughter or imminence of danger of death for purposes of imperfect\nself-defense voluntary manslaughter. Accordingly, the trial court was not required\nto instruct on either theory.\n       Last, defendant cites People v. Garcia (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 18, in\nsupport of his contention that the trial court should have instructed the jury\nconcerning voluntary manslaughter because there was evidence he committed an\nassault with a deadly weapon without malice aforethought. His reliance on Garcia\nis in vain, that decision having been disapproved by this court in People v. Bryant\n(2013) 56 Cal.4th 959, 970, on the very point for which he cites it. In Bryant, we\nheld that a killing without malice in the commission of an inherently dangerous\nassaultive felony “cannot be voluntary manslaughter because voluntary\nmanslaughter requires either an intent to kill or a conscious disregard for life.”\n(Ibid.) Accordingly, this argument is foreclosed by Bryant.\n\n            5. Expert Testimony as Circumstantial Evidence\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury, on its\nown motion, that its instructions on circumstantial evidence applied specifically to\nexpert testimony. He asserts the error violated his federal and state federal\nconstitutional rights to due process, trial by jury, a fair trial, and a reliable penalty\n\n\n\n                                           55\n\fdetermination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal Const., art. I, §§ 7,\nsubd. (a), 15, 16, 17.) The claim is both forfeited and meritless.\n       The trial court gave two standard instructions on circumstantial evidence,\nCALJIC Nos. 2.01 and 2.02, neither of which expressly refers to expert\ntestimony.12 Characterizing expert testimony as a form of circumstantial\nevidence, defendant contends the trial court should have informed the jury that the\n\n\n12      As given here, CALJIC No. 2.01 stated in full: “However, a finding of\nguilt as to any crime may not be based on circumstantial evidence unless the\nproved circumstances are not only (1) consistent with the theory that the defendant\nis guilty of the crime, but (2) cannot be reconciled with any other rational\nconclusion. [¶] Further, each fact which is essential to complete a set of\ncircumstances necessary to establish the defendant‟s guilt must be proved beyond\na reasonable doubt. In other words, before an inference essential to establish guilt\nmay be found to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, each fact or\ncircumstance on which the inference necessarily rests must be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt. [¶] Also, if the circumstantial evidence as to any particular\ncount permits two reasonable interpretations, one of which points to the\ndefendant‟s guilt and the other to his innocence, you must adopt that interpretation\nthat points to the defendant‟s innocence, and reject that interpretation that points to\nhis guilt. [¶] If, on the other hand, one interpretation of this evidence appears to\nyou to be reasonable and the other interpretation to be unreasonable, you must\naccept the reasonable interpretation and reject the unreasonable.”\n        CALJIC No. 2.02, as given here, stated in full: “The specific intent and/or\nmental state with which an act is done may be shown by the circumstances\nsurrounding the commission of the act. However, you may not find the defendant\nguilty of the crime charged in Counts 1, 2, or 3 unless the proved circumstances\nare not only (1) consistent with the theory that the defendant had the required\nspecific intent and/or mental state but (2) cannot be reconciled with any other\nrational conclusion. [¶] Also, if the evidence as to specific intent and/or mental\nstate permits two reasonable interpretations, one of which points to the existence\nof the specific intent and/or mental state and the other to its absence, you must\nadopt that interpretation which points to its absence. If, on the other hand, one\ninterpretation of the evidence as to the specific intent and/or mental state appears\nto you to be reasonable and the other interpretation to be unreasonable, you must\naccept the reasonable interpretation and reject the unreasonable.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\fprinciples expressed in those instructions applied to expert testimony. More\nspecifically, he contends the court should have instructed that “if the expert\ntestimony permitted two reasonable inferences, one of which points to defendant‟s\ninnocence and the other to his guilt, the jury must adopt that interpretation that\npoints to the defendant‟s innocence, and reject that interpretation that points to his\nguilt.”\n          Defendant does not assert that the circumstantial evidence instructions were\nincorrect statements of law. “A party may not complain on appeal that an\ninstruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too general or\nincomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying\nlanguage.” (People v. Lang (1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1024; accord, People v.\nLivingston (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1145, 1166; People v. Lewis (2001) 26 Cal.4th 334,\n380.) Accordingly, the claim is forfeited.\n          The claim is also without merit. Defendant cites no authority for the\nproposition that a trial court is required to specify the evidence or the issues to\nwhich the instructions regarding circumstantial evidence apply. And for good\nreason: how a general instruction applies to specific evidence or theories is an\nargument for counsel to make.\n\n              6. Refused Modification of CALJIC No. 2.11.5\n          Defendant contends the trial court erred when it denied his proposed\nmodification to CALJIC No. 2.11.5 (Unjoined Perpetrators of the Same Crime).\nHis asserts the error violated his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair\ntrial, to a trial by jury, to present a defense, and to a reliable penalty determination.\n(U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal Const. art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a). 15,\n16, 17.) The claim is meritless.\n\n\n\n\n                                           57\n\f       The trial court gave CALJIC No. 2.11.5 as follows: “There has been\nevidence in this case indicating that a person other than defendant was or may\nhave been involved in the crime for which that defendant is on trial. [¶] There\nmay be many reasons why that person is not here on trial. Therefore, do not\nspeculate or guess as to why the other is not being prosecuted in this trial or\nwhether he has been or will be prosecuted. Your sole duty is to decide whether\nthe People have proved the guilt of the defendant on trial.”\n       The instruction was intended to apply to defendant‟s cellmate, Gary Green,\nwho participated in the attack on Addis, but was not on trial. An internal rules\nviolation investigation by the Department of Corrections concluded that Green\nwas involved in the conspiracy to assault Addis and noted there was information\nthat Green had ordered the hit on Addis. Green was assessed a 360-day credit\nloss. However, 20 days after this disciplinary hearing, he was paroled. Based on\nthis record, defendant‟s gang expert, Steven Rigg, testified that Green was not\npunished for his participation in the conspiracy.\n       In light of this evidence, defense counsel requested a modification of\nCALJIC No. 2.11.5 to include the following language: “You may, however,\nconsider the actions taken against Mr. Green by members of the Department of\nCorrections to the extent same have been proved in this case as they bear upon\nissues of fact which you are asked to determine.” The prosecutor, while noting the\ndefense was free to argue its theory that correctional officers were complicit in the\nassault on Addis, objected to the modification of CALJIC No. 2.11.5 because it\n“takes away what this jury instruction is saying.” That is, it invited speculation as\nto why Green had not been prosecuted for the Addis murder. Defense counsel\nargued the modification “clarif[ied] the behavior of the Department of Corrections\ntoward Mr. Green, independent of any prosecutorial decisions that may be relevant\nto the facts in this case.” The trial court rejected the proposed modification.\n\n                                          58\n\f        There was no error. Defendant does not contend, nor could he, that\nCALJIC 2.11.5 was either inapplicable to this case or flawed as given. (See\nPeople v. Brown (2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 560 [purpose of the instruction “ „is to\ndiscourage the jury from irrelevant speculation about the prosecution‟s reasons for\nnot jointly prosecuting all those shown by the evidence to have participated in the\nperpetration of the charged offenses, and also to discourage speculation about the\neventual fates of unjoined perpetrators‟ ”].) The proposed modification would\nhave simultaneously instructed the jury it could not consider the prosecution‟s\nreasons for not prosecuting Green, but it could consider the actions of the\nDepartment of Corrections in giving him assertedly lenient punishment for his part\nin the attack on Addis. As the prosecutor here noted, this conflation of the actions\nof the District Attorney‟s Office and the Department of Corrections could only\nhave confused the jury and potentially eviscerated the instruction. Accordingly,\nthe trial court properly rejected the proposed modification.\n        Moreover, even without the proposed modification, nothing prevented the\ndefense from making its argument that the assertedly lenient treatment of Green by\nthe Department of Corrections was evidence of complicity by some correctional\nofficers in the attack on Addis. Therefore, his claims of error and prejudice both\nfail.\n\n        G. Cumulative Error\n        Because we have found no error in the guilt phase, there is no cumulative\nprejudice to address.\n\n\n\n\n                                         59\n\f                            III. PENALTY PHASE CLAIMS\n\n       A. Claims Related to Defendant’s Convictions for Assault by a Life\n          Prisoner with Malice Aforethought\n\n            1. Applicability of Section 4500 to Defendant at the Time of the\n                Offenses\n       Defendant contends his two convictions of assault by a life prisoner with\nmalice aforethought must be reversed because he was not “undergoing a life\nsentence” (§ 4500) at the time he assaulted Addis (count 2) and Matthews (count\n3). Citing section 1170.1, which addresses when a consecutive term imposed for a\nfelony committed in prison commences, defendant claims that at the time he\ncommitted the assaults, he was still serving a sentence for burglary, and his life\nsentence had not yet begun. He contends that his state and federal constitutional\nrights to due process, trial by jury, and a reliable penalty determination require\nreversal of his convictions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal.\nConst., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.)\n       Preliminarily, the People assert that defendant has forfeited this claim\nbecause he failed to make the argument below and, indeed, did not contest\nevidence presented by the prosecution in the form of prison records to prove he\nwas a life prisoner at the time of the offenses. Defendant casts his claim as one of\nsufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions, and on that basis, maintains\nthat such a claim may be raised for the first time on appeal. (See People v. Butler\n(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1119, 1126 [substantial evidence claim can be raised on appeal\neven if it was not argued at trial].) Assuming, without deciding, that the claim is\nproperly raised, it is without merit.\n       Section 4500 states in pertinent part: “Every person while undergoing a life\nsentence, who is sentenced to state prison within this state, and who, with malice\naforethought, commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon\n\n\n                                            60\n\for instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is\npunishable with death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole” if the\nvictim dies. (Italics added.) Section 1170.1, subdivision (c) (hereinafter section\n1170.1(c)) addresses when such a sentence commences if it is consecutive to a\nterm already being served. It provides that when “any person [is] convicted of one\nor more felonies committed while the person is confined in the state prison . . . and\nthe law either requires the terms to be served consecutively or the court imposes\nconsecutive terms, the term of imprisonment for all the convictions that the person\nis required to serve consecutively shall commence from the time the person would\notherwise have been released from prison.” (§ 1170.1(c), italics added.)\n        Here the evidence shows the following: In June 1992, defendant was\nsentenced to an eight-year prison term after he pleaded guilty to first degree\nburglary. The Department of Corrections calculated his earliest release date for\nthis offense would be February 10, 2000. In September 1995, while still serving\nhis burglary sentence, defendant pleaded guilty to possession of a deadly weapon\nby an inmate (§ 4502) which, because it was his third strike, resulted in a sentence\nof 25 years to life with the possibility of parole, consecutive to his burglary\nsentence. In defendant‟s chronological history log maintained by the Department\nof Corrections, an entry dated November 13, 1995, states: “Life term begins\n2/10/2000.” Defendant‟s assaults on Addis and Matthews were committed in\n1997.\n        Based on this record, defendant contends he was not “undergoing a life\nsentence” when he assaulted his fellow inmates in 1997; rather, he was still\nserving his burglary sentence. We rejected a similar argument in People v.\nMcNabb (1935) 3 Cal.2d 441 (McNabb), which involved section 4500‟s\npredecessor, former section 246. While McNabb was on parole for two robberies\nfor which he had been sentenced to two determinate sentences, he committed two\n\n                                          61\n\fmore robberies, for which he was sentenced to two terms of five years to life.\nUpon his conviction for these later robberies, his parole was revoked and he was\nrequired to serve the rest of the two determinate sentences. Thereafter, while\ntrying to escape from prison, he killed a fellow inmate. McNabb was tried and\nsentenced to death under former section 246, which provided: “ „Every person\nundergoing a life sentence in a state prison of this state, who, with malice\naforethought, commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon\nor instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, is\npunishable with death.‟ ” (McNabb, at p. 444.)\n       On appeal, McNabb contended that he was not serving a life sentence when\nhe attempted to escape because his life sentences for the later robberies, being\nconsecutive to the determinate sentences for the earlier robberies on which his\nparole had been revoked, had not yet commenced. We rejected his argument:\n“The fact that appellant McNabb was returned to prison upon two convictions of\nfirst degree robberies committed while released on parole and was required to\nserve out the uncompleted terms of imprisonment by reason of breaking the terms\nof his parole did not suspend the force of commitments upon which he was held.\nHad he been discharged or released from serving the uncompleted terms by a writ\nof habeas corpus or by pardon he would have still been held as a prisoner serving\na life term on said later commitments. We think the contention . . . to the effect\nthat a person is not undergoing a life sentence within the purpose and meaning of\nthe law, when imprisoned on a judgment which imposes the longest term known to\nthe law and to which nothing further may be added, because, forsooth, he is also\nheld on a prior uncompleted sentence for years does not stand the test of reason.”\n(McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d at p. 457.)\n       We dismissed the defendant‟s reliance on former section 669, which\nprovided that when a person was convicted of multiple crimes, the imprisonment\n\n                                         62\n\ffor each term was to “commence at the termination of the [preceding] term of\nimprisonment.” (Former § 669, as amended by Stats. 1927, ch. 626, § 1, p.\n1056.)13 “Section 669 . . . is not germane to the subject. It has to do with time\nserved in terms less than life. It does not purport to say that a person is not\nundergoing a life sentence when delivered on a certified copy of the judgment of\nconviction to the warden of the state prison. The prisoner is undergoing a life\nsentence whatever may happen and he is held as such a prisoner by virtue of said\njudgment.” (McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d at p. 457.)\n       Finally, we pointed out that former section 246 “was enacted as a\ndisciplinary regulation and as a means of protection to prisoners themselves\nagainst the assaults of the vicious, and also to protect the officers who are required\nto mingle with the inmates, unarmed. . . . It is applicable to the facts of\n[McNabb‟s] case in every sense.” (McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d at p. 458.)\n       In reliance on our decision in McNabb, the Court of Appeal in People v.\nSuperior Court (Bell) (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1334 (Bell), rejected a claim that a\ndefendant‟s attack on another inmate did not occur while he was “undergoing a\nlife sentence” (§ 4500) because he was serving a determinate term at the time of\nthe attack. The court noted that the phrase “undergoing a life sentence” has\nremained constant from the enactment of former section 246 through various\n\n13     In 1929, when McNabb was convicted of the two later robberies, former\nsection 669 provided: “When any person is convicted of two or more crimes the\nformer imprisonment to which he is sentenced upon the second or other\nsubsequent conviction must commence at the termination of the first term of\nimprisonment to which he shall be adjudged, or at the termination of the second or\nother subsequent term of imprisonment, as the case may be; provided, that in\nexceptional cases the judgment, in the discretion of the court, may direct that such\nterms of imprisonment, or any of them, shall run concurrently.” (Stats. 1927,\nch. 626, § 1, p. 1056.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          63\n\famendments to section 4500, and the Legislature‟s intent has also remained the\nsame — protecting guards and other prisoners from inmates who think they have\n“ „nothing left to lose‟ ” by committing crimes in prison. (Bell, supra, 99\nCal.App.4th at p. 1341; see id. at pp. 1340-1341, citing McNabb, supra, 13 Cal.2d\n441.) Bell further observed that in In re Cowen (1946) 27 Cal.2d 637, we\nexplained that former section 669, which required that judgments provide whether\nmultiple terms shall be served concurrently or consecutively, does “ „not . . .\nrequire that for all purposes, when consecutive sentences are directed, the\ndefendant shall be regarded as imprisoned on only one charge at a time.‟ ” (Bell,\nat p. 1343, quoting Cowen, at p. 648.) Bell acknowledged that former section 669\nwas amended after In re Cowen was decided, but concluded that “[a]ccording to\nthe plain language of section 669, the mandate that a determinate sentence be\nserved before a consecutive life sentence is for the purpose of calculating parole\neligibility, and not for the purpose of determining whether the prisoner is\nundergoing a life sentence within the meaning of section 4500.” (Bell, at p. 1343.)\n       Defendant attempts to distinguish McNabb and Bell on the basis that this\ncase is governed by section 1170.1(c), which specifically addresses consecutive\nsentences with respect to crimes committed while in prison, rather than section\n669, which more generally addresses concurrent and consecutive sentences. As\nnoted above, section 1170.1 provides that when an individual is convicted of\nfelonies in prison and consecutive sentences are imposed, “the term of\nimprisonment for all [such] convictions . . . shall commence from the time the\nperson would otherwise have been released from prison.” (§ 1170.1(c).) Based on\nthis language, defendant reasons that his life term under the Three Strikes law for\npossession of a weapon in prison would not have begun until the earliest date on\nwhich he could have been released with respect to his determinate term for the\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\fburglaries that led to his imprisonment. He contends that date would have been\nFebruary 10, 2000, more than two years after he assaulted Addis.\n       Defendant‟s argument is unpersuasive for at least two reasons. First, it\nignores the different language and functions of the two statutes. Section 1170.1(c)\naddresses when an inmate begins “to serve” consecutive sentences, whereas\nsection 4500 addresses the punishment to be imposed for specified assaults\ncommitted “while undergoing a life sentence.” Section 1170.1, like section 669, is\na technical sentencing statute that addresses the time during which an inmate is\nactually serving a particular prison term, and does not purport to have any bearing\non the question of whether an individual is undergoing a life sentence for purposes\nof section 4500. Furthermore, we presume that in enacting section 1170.1(c), the\nLegislature was aware of not only section 4500, but also the case law broadly\ninterpreting the phrase “undergoing a life sentence” in that statute. Had the\nLegislature intended for section 1170.1(c) to modify in any way the latter statute,\nit could have said so.\n       Second, defendant‟s argument would undermine the shared purpose of\nsections 1170.1(c) and 4500 — deterring inmates from committing crimes in\nprison. “Section 1170.1(c) applies to felonies committed when the defendant is\nconfined in a state prison. The statutory scheme makes clear that such felonies,\ni.e., those felonies committed in prison, are exempt from the general sentencing\nscheme.” (People v. White (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 862, 869.) The reason such\nfelonies are treated differently is that “[t]he Legislature wanted in-prison crimes to\nbe punished more severely than crimes committed „on the „outside.‟ ” (Ibid.) It\nwould be inconsistent with the legislative purpose of these statutes to construe\nsection 1170.1(c) to preclude the application of section 4500 to inmates who have\nnot yet begun serving an imposed and pending life sentence because they are still\nserving a determinate sentence.\n\n                                         65\n\f       Finally, defendant contends that because his Three Strikes conviction could\nhave been overturned on appeal before he began to serve it, he was not a person\nundergoing a life sentence when he assaulted Addis. Of course, any life sentence\nconsecutive to a determinate sentence could potentially be modified by\ncommutation, pardon, a statutory change, an ultimately successful appeal or\nhabeas corpus petition, or even avoided by the death of the inmate during the\ndeterminant term. Such speculative outcomes do not undermine the core\nreasoning of McNabb and Bell that the phrase “undergoing a life sentence” was\nintended to encompass an inmate who is subject to such a sentence, even if he or\nshe has not begun “serving” that sentence.\n\n           2. Whether Section 4500 Sufficiently Narrows the Class of Individuals\n              Eligible for the Death Penalty\n       Defendant contends that section 4500 fails to sufficiently narrow the class\nof individuals eligible for the death penalty in violation of his rights to a due\nprocess, and a fair trial, and the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.\n(U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const. art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15,\n16, 17.) We disagree.\n       Under section 4500, a person undergoing a life sentence is eligible for a\ndeath sentence if found guilty of an assault with a deadly weapon or with force\nlikely to produce great bodily injury, with malice aforethought, leading to the\ndeath of the victim. In effect, it authorizes imposition of the death penalty for\nwhat could be a second degree murder, i.e., an unlawful killing with malice\naforethought. In contrast, the vast majority of offenses eligible for the death\npenalty are various forms of first degree murder. (§ 190.2.) Nonetheless, as\ndiscussed below, the legislative determination that life prisoners who commit fatal\naggravated assaults are potentially deserving of death is a venerable one; versions\nof this statute have existed for more than a century. (See former § 246, added by\n\n\n                                          66\n\fStats. 1901, ch. 12, § 1, p. 6.) Moreover, the statute is based on rationales\ninvolving security and deterrence in prison settings (see McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d\nat p. 457; Bell, supra, 99 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1339-1340), and California is scarcely\nalone in recognizing that killings committed by life prisoners in prison constitute a\nspecial class of homicide as to which the severest penalty should potentially apply.\n       Section 4500 is a death eligibility statute as opposed to a death selection\nstatute. (See Tuilaepa v. California (1994) 512 U.S. 967, 971-972.) A defendant\nconvicted of the offense defined by section 4500 becomes eligible for the death\npenalty or its alternative, life without the possibility of parole. Thereafter, the jury\nselects the penalty following a penalty phase trial at which it considers evidence in\naggravation and mitigation under section 190.3. The selection process requires an\n“ „individualized determination‟ ” of the appropriate penalty based on “ „the\ncharacter of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.‟ ” (Tuilaepa, at p.\n972.) This “requirement is met when the jury can consider relevant mitigating\nevidence of the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the\ncrime.” (Ibid.) The requirement of an individualized determination does not,\nhowever, apply to the eligibility stage. (Id. at p. 973.)\n       The distinction between the eligibility and selection phases is significant in\nterms of the “differing constitutional treatment [the United States Supreme Court\nhas] accorded those two aspects of capital sentencing. It is in regard to the\neligibility phase that [the court has] stressed the need for channeling and limiting\nthe jury‟s discretion to ensure that the death penalty is a proportionate punishment\nand therefore not arbitrary or capricious in its imposition. In contrast, in the\nselection phase, [the court has] emphasized the need for a broad inquiry into all\nrelevant mitigating evidence to allow an individualized determination.”\n(Buchanan v. Angelone (1998) 522 U.S. 269, 275-276.)\n\n\n\n                                          67\n\f       “To pass constitutional muster, a capital sentencing scheme [1] must\n„genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and [2] must\nreasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant\ncompared to others found guilty of murder.‟ ” (Lowenfield v. Phelps (1988) 484\nU.S. 231, 244.) With respect to the first requirement, we note that the class of\nindividuals potentially subject to the death penalty under section 4500 is quite\ncircumscribed: persons serving a life sentence who, with malice aforethought,\nassault another with a deadly weapon or instrument, or by any means of force\nlikely to produce great bodily injury, resulting in the death of the victim within a\nyear and a day. (See Woodson v. North Carolina (1976) 428 U.S. 280, 287, fn. 7\n[describing as “an extremely narrow category of homicide” “murder [committed]\nby a prisoner serving a life sentence”].) The statute easily satisfies the\nrequirement that an eligibility factor “apply only to a subclass of defendants\nconvicted of [homicide].” (Tuilaepa v. California, supra, 512 U.S. at p. 972.)\n       With respect to the second requirement — reasonable justification for a\nmore severe sentence — we reiterate that the Legislature has determined that death\neligibility for life prisoners who commit an aggravated assault that leads to the\nvictim‟s death is required to “protect[] [their fellow] prisoners . . . against the\nassaults of the vicious, and also to protect the officers who are required to mingle\nwith the inmates, unarmed.” (McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d at p. 458; accord, Bell,\nsupra, 99 Cal.App.4th at p. 1341.) By imposing more severe penalties on those\nserving life sentences, “the Legislature was attempting to deter severely violent\ncrime by those who might otherwise think themselves immune from punishment\nbecause they were already lifetime guests of the state penal system.” (In re\nCarmichael (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 542, 546.) Along with retribution, deterring\nattacks by life prisoners and thereby promoting the safety of inmates and\ncorrection officers are legitimate penal objectives. (See Kennedy v. Louisiana\n\n                                           68\n\f(2008) 554 U.S. 407, 420 (Kennedy) [“punishment is justified under one or more\nof three principal rationales: rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution”].) These\nrationales of institutional security, deterrence, and retribution provide a reasonable\njustification for distinguishing this category of murder from others to which the\ndeath penalty does not apply.\n       Defendant contends section 4500 fails to sufficiently narrow the subclass of\ndefendants eligible for the death penalty because it does not distinguish between\ndifferent types of life prisoners, such as those serving a life term for murder and\nsomeone like him whose life sentence was imposed under the Three Strikes law\nfor nonviolent felonies.14 There is no requirement at the eligibility stage that a\nnarrowly circumscribed class of defendants for whom the death penalty is\nreasonably justified be further distinguished according to the particular\ncircumstances that led to their eligibility. Rather, that is a question that goes to the\nselection stage and its individualized determination requirement. Only at that\npoint does the Eighth Amendment require “a broad inquiry into all relevant\nmitigating evidence to allow an individualized determination.” (Buchanan v.\nAngelone, supra, 522 U.S. at p. 276.) Although the reason why a defendant was a\nlife prisoner at the time of the violation of section 4500 may be a relevant\nconsideration for the jury at the selection stage, that reason is irrelevant to the\njustification for including such persons in the death-eligible class; the reasons\nunderlying section 4500 apply with equal force to life prisoners who have\n\n\n\n\n14      Defendant‟s life sentence was imposed as a result of his 1995 guilty plea to\na third strike of possession of a weapon in prison (§ 4502) and his admission to\ntwo prior felony convictions for burglary.\n\n\n\n\n                                           69\n\fcommitted prior violent crimes and those who face lifetime imprisonment for\nnonviolent offenses.15\n       Defendant next argues that “[d]evelopments since [prior] decisions\nupholding [earlier versions of] section 4500 and its predecessor statutes have\nundermined the retribution, deterrence and safety rationales offered to justify\ndeath eligibility on life prisoner status.” In essence, defendant‟s claim is that,\nbecause prior versions of section 4500 would not pass constitutional muster in\nlight of evolving Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, the underlying legislative\njustifications for punishing life prisoners who, with malice aforethought, commit\nfatal assaults in prison have also been eroded over time. As explained below, the\nargument fails because the legislative justifications remain valid.\n       Until 1977, section 4500 and its predecessor, former section 246, mandated\nthe death penalty for life prisoners who committed an aggravated assault,\nregardless of whether the victim died. The original statute, enacted in 1901,\nprovided: “Every person undergoing a life sentence in a state prison of this state,\nwho, with malice aforethought, commits an assault upon the person of another\nwith a deadly weapon or instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce\ngreat bodily injury, is punishable with death.” (Stats. 1901, ch. 12, § 1, p. 6.) In\n\n\n15      Defendant‟s reliance on Tuilaepa v.California, supra, 512 U.S. 967, is\nmisplaced. As he concedes, Tuilaepa concerns death selection, not death\neligibility. Moreover, Tuilaepa‟s observation that some sentencing factors may be\nunconstitutionally vague if they lack “some „common-sense core of meaning . . .\nthat criminal juries should be capable of understanding‟ ” (id. at p. 975) does not\nsupport defendant‟s assertion that section 4500 is unconstitutionally vague. As\nTuilaepa itself notes, “[t]he eligibility decision fits the crime within a defined\nclassification.” (Id. at p. 973.) Section 4500 meets this standard. Similarly,\nGodfrey v. Georgia (1980) 446 U.S. 420, also cited by defendant, involved a\nvagueness challenge to a sentencing factor. (Id. at pp. 422-423.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f1941, section 246 was repealed and reenacted, renumbered as section 4500, but\ntextually remained substantially the same. (Stats. 1941, ch. 106, §§ 1, 15, pp.\n1080, 1124.) In 1977, following the restoration of the death penalty in California\n(see People v. Frierson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 172-175), section 4500 was\namended to its present form. The amendment eliminated the mandatory death\npenalty provision and limited eligibility for the death penalty to aggravated\nassaults with malice aforethought resulting in death, with the alternative of life\nwithout the possibility of parole. (Stats. 1977, ch. 316, § 21, p. 1264.)\n       Defendant cites a number of decisions by this court upholding those earlier\nand now superseded versions of the statute against various constitutional\nchallenges (see, e.g., People v. Vaughn (1969) 71 Cal.2d 406, 418 [imposition of\ndeath penalty under section 4500 for an assault that did not result in the death of\nthe victim did not violate the Eighth Amendment‟s proscription against cruel and\nunusual punishment]; People v. Wells (1949) 33 Cal.2d 330, 337 [holding that\nmandatory death penalty imposed under section 4500 on prisoner serving an\nindeterminate sentence “infringes no constitutional limitation”]; People v. Finley\n(1908) 153 Cal. 59 [upholding mandatory death penalty imposed on a life term\ndefendant convicted under former section 246 against an equal protection\nchallenge to the statute]), and asserts that none of these earlier decisions would\nsurvive scrutiny under current Eighth Amendment jurisprudence because the\nEighth Amendment now prohibits the death penalty for nonfatal assaultive crimes,\nand also prohibits mandatory death penalty statutes. (See, e.g., Kennedy, supra,\n554 U.S. 407 [striking down a statute authorizing the death penalty for rape of a\nchild]; Woodson v. North Carolina, supra, 428 U.S. 280 [striking down statute\nmaking the death penalty mandatory for first degree murder]; Graham v. Superior\nCourt (1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 880 [declaring unconstitutional a 1973 version of\nsection 4500 that contained a mandatory death penalty provision].) From this\n\n                                         71\n\fpremise, he contends that the legislative justifications offered in support of the\nstatute in our earlier opinions — deterrence, retribution, and institutional security\n— have been eroded and are now constitutionally suspect.\n       Defendant‟s logic is flawed and the cases on which he relies are inapposite.\nDecisions rejecting constitutional challenges to prior versions of the statute\ncontaining elements that would no longer be constitutionally permissible are\nobviously not controlling in our examination of the current version of the statute.\nNonetheless, the discussions in those earlier decisions of the threats of violence\nposed by prisoners sentenced to life terms as justification for the policy of\npotentially imposing the death penalty on them remain valid and support the\ncurrent version of section 4500.16 The United States Supreme Court continues to\nrecognize that penal statutes may legitimately rest on one or more of “three\nprincipal rationales: rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution” (Kennedy, supra,\n554 U.S. at p. 420.) Section 4500, as already noted, singles out a particular\nsubclass of defendants who commit lethal assaults with malice aforethought —\nthose imprisoned for life — and makes them eligible for the death penalty because\nthe Legislature has determined their particular status as life prisoners requires this\nexceptional measure to protect correctional officers and other inmates. With the\n\n16      For example, in People v. Finley, supra, 153 Cal. at page 61, this court\nobserved that “it has long been a part of judicial knowledge, of legislative\nknowledge, and, indeed, of general knowledge, that convicts in penal institutions\nundergoing sentences for life, constitute a most reckless and dangerous class. The\nconditions of their sentences destroy their hopes and with the destruction of hope\nall bonds of restraint are broken and there follows a recklessness leading to brutal\ncrimes. . . . They were crimes of violence committed not alone against fellow\ninmates, but upon the custodians, officers, and guards of the institutions. . . .\nUnder this well-recognized condition of affairs it seemed expedient to the\nlegislature to meet the situation by the enactment of section 246 of the Penal\nCode.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          72\n\fgrowth in the prison population and prison gangs, this rationale applies with equal\nor greater force today compared to when it was first articulated over a hundred\nyears ago. Accordingly, we reject defendant‟s assertion that the statute‟s rationale\nhas been superseded or undermined merely because earlier versions of the statute\nwould no longer pass constitutional muster.\n       The opinion upon which defendant places primary reliance, Sumner v.\nShuman (1987) 483 U.S. 66, is inapposite. In Sumner, the United States Supreme\nCourt declared unconstitutional a Nevada statute that mandated the death penalty\nfor prisoners who committed murder while undergoing a sentence of life without\nthe possibility of parole. Under Nevada law, life without the possibility of parole\ncould be imposed for crimes other than murder, such as kidnapping, rape and\nbattery with substantial bodily harm. (Id. at pp. 80-81.) The Supreme Court noted\nthat under those circumstances, “[w]ithout consideration of the nature of the\npredicate life-term offense and the circumstances surrounding the commission of\nthat offense, the label „life-term inmate‟ reveals little about the inmate‟s record or\ncharacter.” (Id. at p. 81.) The court further noted that “a guided-discretion\nsentencing procedure does not undermine any deterrent effect that the threat of the\ndeath penalty may have” (id. at p. 83), and that a guided-discretion procedure does\nnot necessarily allow an inmate to avoid retribution (id. at pp. 83-84). The court\ndid not, however, question the legitimacy of deterrence and retribution as\nrationales. In short, the statute in Sumner differs from section 4500 in crucial\nrespects, and defendant‟s reliance on Sumner is misplaced.\n       Defendant also cites two studies assertedly demonstrating that the death\npenalty has an insignificant deterrent effect on prison murders.17 The weight and\n\n17    Defendant cites Sorensen & Pilgrim, An Actuarial Risk Assessment of\nViolence Posed by Capital Murder Defendants (2000) 90 J. Crim. L. &\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                          73\n\fvalidity of such studies involve policy questions within the Legislature‟s purview.\nSo, too, do defendant‟s arguments regarding retributive steps short of death that\nmight be taken against prisoners who kill. These studies do not establish that\nimposing death eligibility on life prisoners who commit fatal aggravated assaults\nis constitutionally impermissible.\n        Next, defendant contends that an “interjurisdictional comparison\ndemonstrates a lack of societal consensus that a murder by a life prisoner”\ndeserves the death penalty. We are not persuaded.\n        In evaluating whether there was a consensus against making the crime of\nrape of a child punishable by death, the United States Supreme Court examined\nboth “[t]he history of the death penalty for the crime of rape” and the current\nstatus of such statutes in the United States. (Kennedy, supra, 554 U.S. at p. 422.)\nThe court traced an historical movement away from imposing the death penalty for\nrape from its high point in 1925 when 18 states, the District of Columbia and the\nfederal government had such statutes, to the post-Furman (Furman v. Georgia\n(1972) 408 U.S. 238) landscape, when only Louisiana and five other states had\nreenacted such statutes. The court further noted that the statutes of four of those\nstates were more restrictive than Louisiana‟s law, because they required a prior\nconviction for rape as a condition for death eligibility while the remaining state,\nGeorgia, required aggravating circumstances including, but not limited to, a prior\nconviction. (Kennedy, supra, 554 U.S. at p. 423.) “By contrast, 44 States have\nnot made child rape a capital offense. As for federal law, Congress in the Federal\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nCriminology 1251, and Marquart & Sorensen, A National Study of the Furman-\nCommuted Inmates: Assessing the Threat to Society from Capital Offenders\n(1989) 23 Loyola L.A. L.Rev. 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                          74\n\fDeath Penalty Act of 1994 expanded the number of federal crimes for which the\ndeath penalty is a permissible sentence, including certain nonhomicide offenses;\nbut it did not do the same for child rape or abuse. [Citation.] Under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2245, an offender is death eligible only when the sexual abuse or exploitation\nresults in the victim‟s death.” (Ibid.)\n       The court drew comparisons between these statistics and those it had\nexamined in three earlier cases in which it had held the death penalty\nunconstitutional when imposed upon certain types of aiders and abettors to felony\nmurder (Enmund v. Florida (1982) 458 U.S. 782), the intellectually disabled\n(Atkins v. Virginia, supra, 536 U.S. 304), and juveniles (Roper v. Simmons (2005)\n543 U.S. 551). (Kennedy, supra, 554 U.S. at pp. 425-426.) As in those cases, the\ncourt‟s survey led it to conclude that the “evidence of a national consensus with\nrespect to the death penalty for child rapists . . . shows divided opinion but, on\nbalance, an opinion against it.” (Id. at p. 426.) The court concluded: “After\nreviewing the authorities informed by contemporary norms, including the history\nof the death penalty for this and other nonhomicide crimes, current state statutes\nand new enactments, and the number of executions since 1964, we conclude there\nis a national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape.”\n(Id. at p. 434.)\n       As an initial matter, it is significant that the court in Kennedy explicitly and\nrepeatedly referred to the fact that the statute at issue authorized the death penalty\nfor a crime that, while still devastating for the victim, did not result in the victim‟s\ndeath. (See, e.g., Kennedy, supra, 554 U.S. at p. 435 [acknowledging that “there\nare moral grounds to question a rule barring capital punishment for a crime against\nan individual that did not result in death”]; id. at p. 437 [“the death penalty should\nnot be expanded to instances where the victim‟s life was not taken”]; id. at p. 439\n[recognizing the possibility of arbitrary results in cases of heinous crimes that may\n\n                                           75\n\f“overwhelm a decent person‟s judgment” and refusing to “sanction this result\nwhen the harm to the victim, though grave, cannot be quantified in the same way\nas death of the victim”].) Of course, for a violation of section 4500 to be death\neligible, the victim must die (within a year and a day) from the assault.\nAccordingly, a major aspect of the court‟s reasoning in Kennedy does not apply\nhere.\n        Defendant nonetheless contends that there is no “societal consensus” to\nsupport imposition of death for a life prisoner who kills. In support of his claim,\nhe cites the high court‟s decisions in Kennedy, Roper, Atkins, and Enmund, but his\nanalysis bears only a superficial resemblance to those opinions‟ rigorous\nexamination of historical, judicial, and legislative trends regarding the existence of\nan evolving national consensus against authorization of imposition of the death\npenalty on a class of defendants. Instead, he rests his argument solely on his\nassertion that 75 percent of American jurisdictions have rejected using prisoner\nstatus to determine death eligibility. His statistical reading is tendentious. In fact,\nbased on his statistics, it is more accurate to say that the vast majority of\njurisdictions with the death penalty regard custody status as a significant factor in\neither death penalty eligibility or death penalty selection, or for both purposes. Of\nthe 31 states and the federal government whose laws currently authorize\nimposition of the death penalty, the laws of 29 states and the federal government\nuse custody status as a death-eligibility or a death-selection factor, or both. It\nappears that only Nebraska and South Carolina do not explicitly include custodial\nstatus as a death-eligibility or selection factor.\n        Defendant does not cite, nor has our research found, a single judicial\ndecision from any death penalty jurisdiction that has held that the use of custodial\nstatus as either an eligibility or a selection factor for the death penalty violates the\nEighth Amendment. Nor has defendant shown that any jurisdiction that reenacted\n\n                                           76\n\fthe death penalty following Furman v. Georgia, supra, 408 U.S. 238, omitted\ncustodial status as either an eligibility or selection factor for purposes of the death\npenalty. Thus, defendant fails to demonstrate the existence of an historical\ntrajectory supporting a conclusion that the majority, or, indeed, any, of the death\npenalty jurisdictions has abandoned custody status as a factor for imposing the\ndeath penalty.\n       Instead, defendant attempts to parse the statistical evidence to argue that we\nshould look only at states whose statutes mirror section 4500, that is, statutes that\nuse life term status as an eligibility factor and apply the death penalty to killings\nthat do not rise to the level of first degree murder. Using this metric, defendant\nconcludes that only eight states have a law comparable to section 4500.\n       However, the question here is whether custodial status is used by a majority\nof jurisdictions as a basis for potentially imposing the death penalty, not how\nindividual jurisdictions use that factor. In other words, is there a consensus that\nthe death penalty is not an appropriate punishment for a fatal aggravated assault by\na life prisoner? Moreover, in this case, where defendant was also convicted of\nfirst degree murder, he would have faced the death penalty in every jurisdiction\nthat uses custodial status as either an eligibility or selection factor. Even granting\nthat only a few states have statutes mirroring section 4500, this number is\nmeaningless without a rigorous analysis of the type undertaken by the United\nStates Supreme Court, which examines not simply numbers, but statutory history\nand relevant judicial and legislative actions, to answer the national consensus\nquestion. Defendant provides none of that, and as mentioned, we have uncovered\nnothing that suggests a majority of the country rejects the death penalty in\ncircumstances covered by section 4500.\n       Finally, defendant asserts the status of life prisoner is overbroad because it\ndoes not further distinguish between those inmates whose life sentence was the\n\n                                          77\n\fresult of a violent crime and those, like himself, whose life sentence is premised\non a Third Strike as to which the predicate crimes were nonviolent felonies.\n        As noted earlier, however prisoners subject to life sentences came to hold\nthat status, they are a small and distinct subclass of those who commit homicides\npunishable as murder. Additionally, the rationale for making such defendants\ndeath eligible — to deter and punish crimes by individuals acting under the belief\nthey have nothing left to lose — applies to all life prisoners regardless of the\nreason for their life sentences. Furthermore, to the extent the reasons for a\ndefendant‟s life sentence might mitigate his or her punishment, that is an issue that\ncan be raised at the penalty phase.\n        For these reasons, we reject defendant‟s constitutional challenge to section\n4500‟s death eligibility provision.\n\n        B. Prosecutorial Discretion in Seeking Death Penalty\n        Defendant contends that prosecutorial discretion in seeking the death\npenalty violates his federal and state constitutional rights to due process and equal\nprotection, and constitutes “the arbitrary and capricious enforcement of the death\npenalty.” (U.S. Const., 5th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, § 7, subd,\n(a).)\n        We have consistently held that “prosecutorial discretion to select those\neligible cases in which the death penalty actually will be sought does not, in and of\nitself, evidence an arbitrary and capricious capital punishment system, nor does\nsuch discretion transgress the principles underlying due process of law, equal\nprotection of the laws, or the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.”\n(People v. Crittenden (1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 152.) As we explained in an early\ndecision addressing the issue: “Many circumstances may affect the litigation of a\ncase chargeable under the death penalty law. These include factual nuances,\n\n\n\n                                          78\n\fstrength of evidence, and, in particular, the broad discretion to show leniency.\nHence, one sentenced to death under a properly channeled death penalty scheme\ncannot prove a constitutional violation by showing that other persons whose\ncrimes were superficially similar did not receive the death penalty. [Citations.]\nThe same reasoning applies to the prosecutor‟s decisions to pursue or withhold\ncapital charges at the outset.” (People v. Keenan (1988) 46 Cal.3d 478, 506.) In\nsubsequent cases, we rejected the argument that we should reexamine this holding\nin light of the high court‟s voting rights decision in Bush v. Gore (2000) 531 U.S.\n98. (People v. Bennett (2009) 45 Cal.4th 577, 629, fn. 19.) We continue to adhere\nto that holding. (See, e.g., People v. Bryan, Smith and Wheeler (2014) 60 Cal.4th\n335, 469; People v. Scott (2011) 52 Cal.4th 452, 495; People v. Gamache (2010)\n48 Cal.4th 347, 406.) Nothing in defendant‟s arguments persuades us that our\nearlier rulings were incorrect. Furthermore, the reasoning of those cases applies\nwith equal force to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to seek the death\npenalty under section 4500.\n\n       C. Admission of Evidence of Defendant’s Criminal History\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed the\nprosecutor to elicit from a defense expert on cross-examination details of\ndefendant‟s theft-related prior offenses and juvenile adjudications. He contends\nthe ruling also violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process, a\nfair trial, trial by jury, and a reliable penalty determination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th,\n8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a). 15, 16, 17.) The claim is\nmeritless.\n\n             1. Background\n       James Cuevas testified for the defense in his capacity as a casework\nspecialist for the California Youth Authority (CYA), now known as the California\n\n\n\n                                           79\n\fDivision of Juvenile Justice, a position he likened to that of a social worker.\nCuevas described his function as providing “diagnostic evaluations for the court”\nand the CYA. Although not a psychologist, his academic credentials included\ncourses in psychology and “some basic understanding of various mental health\nissues.” His formal degree was a masters in social work.\n       In 1987, defendant, then 19 years old, pleaded guilty to two counts of\nburglary and one count of grand theft auto. Although an adult, the court referred\ndefendant to the CYA in lieu of state prison under a statute that allowed the\ntransfer of individuals under 21 to the CYA. Cuevas led the team that assessed\ndefendant to determine “a treatment plan and also potential placement for his\nbenefit.” This assessment was memorialized in a 97-page document labeled\nDaniel Landry Mental Health Records. On direct examination, Cuevas reviewed\nthe report and testified generally to its observations and conclusions regarding\ndefendant‟s mental health and treatment plan. For example, he testified about\ndefendant‟s troubled family life, including the fact that his parents were both deaf\nand had emotional problems. He also stated that defendant reported he had been\nsexually molested on two occasions. He reviewed defendant‟s placements as a\njuvenile in institutions for juveniles with emotional problems, and he reported that\ndefendant told him he had escaped from juvenile hall. Cuevas recounted that\ndefendant seemed depressed and suicidal, and that he had recommended that\ndefendant receive intensive individual therapy as well as group therapy and be\nenrolled in educational and vocational programs.\n       Over defendant‟s objection, and following an Evidence Code section 402\nhearing, the trial court allowed the prosecutor to cross-examine Cuevas about the\ndetails of the three offenses for which defendant was referred to the CYA, as well\nas prior juvenile theft-related adjudications. At the evidentiary hearing, Cuevas\nstated that defendant‟s criminal history was “[e]xtremely important” to his\n\n                                         80\n\fassessment of defendant and his recommendations as to treatment and placement.\nIn addition, in response to a question from the court, he explained that the specific\ndetails of a prior offense were relevant to a treatment plan “because we may send\nhim to a placement program . . . that will deal with individuals with that particular\nproblem. . . . So we look at the pattern of behavior.”\n       On cross-examination, Cuevas again stated that a person‟s criminal history\nwas very important to his assessment and recommendations because it factored\ninto the decision about placement and treatment. He explained that defendant‟s\nhistory of “thievery” demonstrated he was “a chronic, habitual offender,” for\nwhom earlier attempts at intervention had failed. He testified that, as a juvenile,\ndefendant had been provided with various opportunities for rehabilitation after\njuvenile petitions charging theft-related offenses had been sustained against him.\nCuevas explained that defendant‟s prior criminal history and prior placements\nwere relevant to his future placement because it “sort of, you know, curtails the\ntype of . . . trust we can . . . provide for him . . . within the facility.” The\nprosecutor then led Cuevas through defendant‟s current and prior convictions and\njuvenile adjudications in detail. This testimony addressed sustained juvenile\npetitions for burglary when defendant was 15 years old and when he was 16 years\nold, as well as details of his then-current offenses. Based on that history, Cuevas\nconcluded that defendant was a “chronic habitual offender.” In light of this,\nCuevas had recommended that defendant be placed in a “closed, locked setting” at\nwhich he would “be supervised every minute of his life.”\n\n            2. Discussion\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed the\nprosecutor to cross-examine Cuevas about the details of defendant‟s prior theft-\nrelated convictions and juvenile adjudications, because they did not involve the\n\n\n\n                                            81\n\fuse or attempted use or threat of violence and were thus inadmissible as a factor in\naggravation under section 190.3, factor (b). He contends further that the testimony\nwas irrelevant because the details of defendant‟s criminal history were “not\nimportant to [Cuevas‟s] clinical impressions and his long-range custodial plans.”18\n       Regarding defendant‟s first argument, the evidence of his theft-related\ncriminal history was not presented by the prosecution pursuant to section 190.3,\nfactor (b) but was, instead, proper rebuttal to the defense case in mitigation.\n“Rebuttal evidence is relevant and admissible if it tends to disprove a fact of\nconsequence on which the defendant has introduced evidence. . . . The trial court\nhas broad discretion to determine the admissibility of rebuttal evidence and, absent\npalpable abuse, an appellate court may not disturb the trial court‟s exercise of that\ndiscretion.” (People v. Valdez (2012) 55 Cal.4th 82, 169; see People v. Mitcham\n(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1027, 1072-1073 [evidence of the defendant‟s juvenile\nadjudications were admissible to rebut evidence of his good character and, as such,\nwas “not subject to the notice requirement of section 190.3 and need not relate to\nany specific aggravating factor under section 190.3”].)\n       We also reject defendant‟s contention that the evidence of his criminal\nrecord was irrelevant because it was not an important part of Cuevas‟s assessment\nand treatment plan for defendant. Cuevas himself repeatedly testified that\ndefendant‟s prior record was an important aspect of his assessment and\n\n\n\n\n18     Additionally, he argues that defendant‟s juvenile adjudications were\ninadmissible as prior convictions under Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S.\n466 and its progeny. His reply brief acknowledges this argument is foreclosed by\nour decision in People v. Nguyen (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1007, but he urges us to\nreconsider it. We decline to do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                          82\n\frecommendations, giving as an example how defendant‟s prior record of thievery\nwould have affected the degree of security and supervision he would require.\n       More generally, the evidence was relevant to rebut the sympathetic portrait\ndefendant was attempting to paint of himself for the jury. The defense called\nCuevas to further its overall depiction of defendant as the victim of a grossly\nabusive family who, as a result, suffered from severe emotional and psychological\nproblems that mitigated his current offense. The defense sought to do so by\nselectively questioning Cuevas about his evaluation of defendant, focusing on his\nchaotic family background and depressed mental state. The prosecution was\nentitled to rebut this characterization that defendant was a victim by demonstrating\nthat Cuevas‟s assessment also included his view that defendant was a habitual\nchronic offender who had failed in previous attempts at rehabilitation.19 Thus, the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the prosecution to question\nCuevas about defendant‟s prior criminal record in order “to present a more\nbalanced picture of the defendant‟s personality.” (People v. Valdez, supra, 55\nCal.4th at p. 170.)\n\n\n\n19     Defendant quotes a sentence from In re Lucas (2004) 33 Cal.4th 682, in\nwhich we said, “Evidence that a defendant suffered abuse in childhood generally\ndoes not open the door to evidence of defendant‟s prior crimes or other\nmisconduct.” (Id. at p. 733.) In Lucas, we granted the defendant‟s petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus based on his claim that his trial attorney was constitutionally\nineffective for failing to investigate or present mitigating evidence of abuse he\nsuffered as a child. The sentence defendant quotes was in connection with our\ndiscussion regarding prejudice and our comment that the respondent had not\noffered any theory under which evidence of the abuse defendant suffered as a\nchild would, in and of itself, have opened the door to rebuttal evidence. (Ibid.)\nThat observation has no bearing on the present case, which is distinguishable both\nlegally and factually.\n\n\n\n\n                                          83\n\f       D. Admission of Razor Blade Evidence\n       Defendant contends the admission of evidence that he was in possession of\na razor blade discovered in his cell during the penalty phase trial was an abuse of\ndiscretion and violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process, a\nfair trial, trial by jury, and reliable capital sentencing proceedings. (U.S. Const.,\n5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.) The\ncontention is meritless.\n       In a search of defendant‟s cell during the penalty phrase trial, a razor blade\nwas discovered on a table. Defendant was not permitted to possess razor blades.\nThe prosecution sought to present evidence of this incident under section 190.3,\nfactor (b), which allows evidence of criminal activity which “[i]nvolved the use or\nattempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or\nviolence.” The prosecution argued that defendant‟s possession of the razor blade\nviolated section 4502, subdivision (a), which prohibits possession, custody or\ncontrol of a weapon, including “any dirk or dagger or sharp instrument” by a\nperson confined in any penal institution. Over the defense‟s objection, the trial\ncourt admitted the evidence.\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion because there was\nno evidence he intended to use the razor blade to attack anyone and, therefore, his\npossession did not constitute the use or attempted use of or express or implied\nthreat to use violence. We previously rejected this argument in People v. Wallace\n(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1032, in which the defendant similarly argued that simple\npossession of a razor blade, without evidence that he had threatened to use it, is\nnot admissible under section 190.3, factor (b). “As we have previously explained,\n„mere possession of a potentially dangerous weapon in custody involves an\nimplied threat of violence . . . .‟ [Citation.] The circumstances of defendant‟s\npossession of the contraband, particularly when viewed together with his overall\n\n\n                                          84\n\fconduct while in custody — which included five rules violations for fighting —\nlead us to conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\nevidence of defendant‟s razor possession under section 190.3, factor (b).”\n(Wallace, at p. 1082.)\n       As noted above, in this case, the prosecution introduced evidence that\ndefendant had, on numerous occasions, possessed prison-made slashing\ninstruments and had used them to attack fellow inmates. At least one of these\nweapons had been fashioned out of a razor blade. The trial court clearly did not\nact outside the bounds of reason in concluding defendant‟s possession of the razor\nblade discovered in his cell during the penalty phase trial could constitute evidence\nof a threat of violence. In these circumstances, the court acted well within its\ndiscretion when it admitted the razor blade evidence under section 190.3,\nfactor (b).\n\n       E. Admission of Criminal Activity Beyond the Statute of Limitations\n       Defendant contends the admission of 18 prior criminal incidents under\nsection 190.3, factor (b) was barred by the statute of limitations. As he concedes,\nhowever, we have repeatedly rejected this argument. “ „[N]either remoteness nor\nthe expiration of the statutory limitations period bars admission of a defendant‟s\nprior unadjudicated criminal activity for purposes of section 190.3, factor (b).‟ ”\n(People v. Famalaro (2011) 52 Cal.4th 1, 42, quoting People v. Medina (1995) 11\nCal.4th 694, 772.) Defendant‟s arguments do not persuade us that reconsideration\nof these decisions is warranted.\n\n       F. Claims of Instructional Error\n\n              1. Instruction on Defenses to Criminal Activity and Defendant’s\n                  Mental Health Evidence\n       Defendant contends the trial court‟s failure to instruct the jury, on the\ncourt‟s own motion, to consider certain defenses to certain unadjudicated criminal\n\n                                          85\n\factivity introduced by the prosecution under section 190.3, factor (b), after the\ncourt granted the prosecution‟s request to instruct on the elements of those\noffenses, violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process, a fair\ntrial, trial by jury, and reliable capital sentencing proceedings. (U.S. Const., 5th,\n6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.)\nSpecifically, he contends the trial court should have instructed the jury that self-\ndefense against the use of excessive force was a defense to an incident on October\n21, 1994, during which defendant was forcibly extracted from his cell after\nrefusing to return his food tray. Furthermore, he contends the trial court should\nhave instructed the jury to consider the impact of his mental health issues on all\nfactor (b) evidence. The claim is meritless.\n       Over the defense‟s objection, the trial court agreed to instruct the jury on\nthe elements of the section 190.3, factor (b) offenses. The defense did not request\nany further instruction on these offenses and none was given.\n       Preliminarily, the People contend defendant has forfeited this claim because\nhe assertedly had a tactical reason for not requesting additional instruction — he\nwanted to minimize the jury‟s focus on his criminal activity. “When defense\ncounsel makes a „ “conscious, deliberate tactical choice” ‟ to request [or object to]\nan instruction, any error in the giving [or refusal to give] the instruction is invited\nand cannot be raised on appeal.” (People v. Catlin (2001) 26 Cal.4th 81, 150.)\nHowever, defendant‟s objection was only to the prosecutor‟s request to instruct the\njury on the elements of the offenses. This limited objection does not bar\ndefendant‟s present claim, which relates to the trial court‟s further duty, once it\nagreed to give the elements instruction, to “instruct sua sponte on legally available\ndefenses.” (People v. Montiel (1993) 5 Cal.4th 877, 942.)\n       In prior decisions, we have assumed without deciding that when the trial\ncourt gives an instruction on the elements of section 190.3, factor (b) offenses,\n\n                                           86\n\fthose instructions should include any applicable defenses. (People v. Montiel,\nsupra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 942; see, also, People v. Cain (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1, 72.)\nNonetheless, the court is under no obligation to provide such instruction unless\n“such defenses are supported by substantial evidence.” (People v. Montiel, at\np. 942.) “Substantial evidence is evidence sufficient to „deserve consideration by\nthe jury,‟ that is, evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive.” (People\nv. Barton (1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 201, fn. 8.) Defendant fails to identify such\nevidence. He does no more than repeat his version of the circumstances under\nwhich correctional officers were forced to remove him from his cell after he\nrefused to return his food tray and refused to come out peaceably. Thus, no self-\ndefense instruction was warranted.\n       With respect to his claim that the trial court should have instructed the jury\nto consider evidence of his mental health problems as they bore on the section\n190.3, factor (b) evidence, defendant fails to demonstrate how such evidence\nwould have comprised a legal defense to any of those offenses. Rather, he\ncontends that such evidence was a potentially mitigating factor and the jury should\nhave been so instructed. Such instruction was given in the form of an instruction\npatterned on section 190.3, factor (k). The jury was told it could consider in\nmitigation “any sympathetic or any aspect of the defendant‟s character or record\nthat the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not\nrelated to the offense for which he is on trial.” Furthermore, in discussing the\nfactor (b) evidence, defense counsel specifically argued that the evidence of\ndefendant‟s mental health issues and the failure of correctional authorities to\nrespond to his request for treatment “remarkabl[y] diminished the weight of\n[factor (b)] material.” Accordingly, the jury was instructed it could consider this\nevidence, and defense counsel explicitly urged them to do so.\n\n\n\n                                         87\n\f       Defendant asserts, however, that the section 190.3, factor (k) instruction\nwas insufficient to direct the jury to the particular issue of the effect of his mental\nillness as it related to the section 190.3, factor (b) evidence. That claim is forfeited\nby his failure to seek clarification or amplification of the instruction. (People v.\nLang (1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1024 [“A party may not complain on appeal that an\ninstruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too general or\nincomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying\nlanguage”].)\n\n           2. CALJIC No. 8.87\n       Defendant contends CALJIC No. 8.87, which addresses evidence related to\nsection 190.3, factor (b), is flawed because (1) it creates a mandatory presumption\nof violence and (2) it fails to require that jurors unanimously agree that defendant\ncommitted the factor (b) criminal activity.20 We have previously rejected these\nchallenges to the instruction. (People v. Butler, supra, 46 Cal.4th at pp. 871-872\n[CALJIC No. 8.87 does not create a mandatory presumption]; People v. Zambrano\n(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1082, 1181-1182 [unanimity not required].) Nothing in\ndefendant‟s argument persuades us to revisit these conclusions.\n\n20      In pertinent part, the jury was instructed as follows: “Evidence has been\nintroduced for the purpose of showing that the defendant has committed the\nfollowing criminal acts or activities . . . all of which involved the express or\nimplied use of force or violence or the threat of force or violence. Before a juror\nmay consider any criminal activity as an aggravating circumstance in this case, a\njuror must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant . . . did in fact\ncommit the criminal activity. A juror may not consider any evidence of any other\ncriminal activity as an aggravating circumstance. [¶] It is not necessary for all\njurors to agree. If any juror is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the\ncriminal activity occurred, that juror may consider that activity as a fact in\naggravation. If not so convinced, that juror must not consider that evidence for\nany purpose.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          88\n\f           3. Instruction Regarding Punishment of Accomplice\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury to\nconsider as a mitigating circumstance the punishment meted out to his accomplice,\nGary Green. As defendant acknowledges, we have repeatedly rejected the claim\nthat a court should instruct the jury that it may consider lenient treatment of an\naccomplice as a mitigating circumstance. “ „We have consistently held that\nevidence of an accomplice‟s sentence is irrelevant at the penalty phase because “it\ndoes not shed any light on the circumstances of the offense or the defendant‟s\ncharacter, background, history or mental condition.” ‟ ” (People v. Brown, supra,\n31 Cal.4th at p. 562; accord, People v. Whalen (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1, 85.)\nSimilarly, we have rejected calls to reexamine our conclusion in light of Parker v.\nDugger (1991) 498 U.S. 308, which defendant also cites. (People v. Cain, supra,\n10 Cal.4th at p. 63 [“Parker did not hold evidence of an accomplice‟s sentence\nmust be introduced in mitigation at the penalty phase, or that a comparison\nbetween sentences given codefendants is required”].) We adhere to these\nconclusions.\n\n           4. Use of Restrictive Adjectives and Restrictive Timeframe in\n               Instructions on Mitigating Factors\n       Defendant contends the use of certain restrictive adjectives in CALJIC\nNo. 8.85 pertaining to mitigating factors, such as “extreme” and “substantial,”\nimpose an unconstitutional threshold requirement before the jury may consider\nmitigating evidence. We have repeatedly rejected this argument (People v. Cage\n(2015) 62 Cal.4th 256, 296), and do so again. We have also consistently rejected\ndefendant‟s related claim that language in section 190.3, factors (d) and (h)\nallowing consideration of defendant‟s mental or emotional state or intoxication at\nthe time of the offense precludes the jury from considering such evidence when it\n\n\n\n\n                                          89\n\fis not related to the offense (People v. Combs (2004) 34 Cal.4th 821, 867-868),\nand do so again.\n\n            5. CALJIC No. 8.88\n       Defendant makes familiar and oft-rejected challenges to CALJIC No. 8.88,\nwhich advises jurors regarding the scope of their discretion to reject death and\nreturn a verdict of life without the possibility of parole. We again conclude that\nthe instruction is “not unconstitutional for failing to inform the jury that: (a) death\nmust be the appropriate penalty, not just a warranted penalty [citation]; (b) [a\nsentence of life without the possibility of parole] is required, if it finds that the\nmitigating circumstances outweigh those in aggravation [citation] or that the\naggravating circumstances do not outweigh those in mitigation [citation]; (c) [a\nsentence of life without the possibility of parole] may be imposed even if the\naggravating circumstances outweigh those in mitigation [citation]; (d) neither\nparty bears the burden of persuasion on the penalty determination [citation]. [¶]\n[Moreover,] section 190.3 and the pattern instructions are not constitutionally\ndefective for failing to assign the state the burden of proving beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that an aggravating factor exists, that the aggravating factors outweigh the\nmitigating factors, and that death is the appropriate penalty. . . . The recent\ndecisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the Sixth Amendment‟s\njury trial guarantee do not compel a different result.” (People v. Bramit (2009) 46\nCal.4th 1221, 1249-1250, fn. omitted.) Finally, the use of the phrase “ „ “so\nsubstantial” ‟ ” as a standard of comparison for mitigating and aggravating factors\ndoes not render the instruction unconstitutional. (People v. Dykes (2009) 46\nCal.4th 731, 814.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           90\n\f       G. Constitutional Challenges to Death Penalty Statute\n       Defendant raises a number of challenges to the constitutionality of the\ndeath penalty statute, which, as he acknowledges, we have previously and\nconsistently rejected. His arguments fail to persuade us to reconsider our prior\ndecisions and, therefore, we again reject the contentions that the statute is\nunconstitutional because it (1) fails to require the jury to find the existence of\naggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt (People v. Cage, supra, 62 Cal.4th\nat p. 296); (2) does not require written findings of factors in aggravation (ibid.);\n(3) does not require that the jury be instructed that mitigating factors can be\nconsidered solely for mitigation (ibid.); (4) does not require intercase\nproportionality review (People v. Charles (2015) 61 Cal.4th 308, 337); and (5)\nprovides certain procedural safeguards to noncapital defendants that are not\navailable to capital defendants (ibid.).\n\n       H. Denial of Automatic Motion to Modify Death Verdict\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred when it denied his automatic\nmotion to modify the death verdict (§ 190.4, subd. (e)) because it gave no weight\nto the mitigating evidence of duress, and it erroneously found that evidence of his\nmental health problems was not mitigating. He asserts the error violated his\nfederal and state constitutional rights to due process and a reliable penalty\ndetermination, and the prohibition against arbitrary and capricious imposition of\nthe death penalty. (U.S. Const., 5th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art I, §§ 7,\nsubd. (a), 15, 17.) Defendant failed to object to the trial court‟s ruling and his\nclaim is therefore forfeited. (People v. Carasi, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1316.) It is\nalso meritless.\n       “Every death verdict triggers an automatic application for modification of\nthe sentence. [Citation.] The trial court is obligated to review the evidence,\nindependently reweigh any aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and\n\n\n                                           91\n\fdetermine whether the weight of the evidence supports the verdict. [Citations.] In\nruling on the application, the trial court must set forth reasons on the record and\ndirect that they be entered in the clerk‟s minutes. [Citation.] On appeal, we\nreview the trial court‟s ruling independently, but it is not our role to redetermine\nthe penalty in the first instance.” (People v. Gamache, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p.\n403.) “Where the record shows the trial court properly performed its duty under\nsection 190.4, subdivision (e), to conduct an independent reweighing of the\naggravating and mitigating evidence, the court‟s ruling will be upheld.” (People v.\nCunningham (2015) 61 Cal.4th 609, 669.)\n       Here, the trial court‟s written statement of reasons for denying the motion\ndemonstrates it was aware of its obligation to independently consider all the\nevidence. The court noted, however, that it was not the court‟s intention to “list\nevery item of evidence . . . , but rather to recite the principal factors, which most\npowerfully inform and influence the decision at hand.” This was proper; the court\nwas not required to “recount „every detail‟ supporting its determination.” (People\nv. Lewis and Oliver (2006) 39 Cal.4th 970, 1064.)\n       The trial court considered both aggravating and mitigating evidence. With\nrespect to the factors in aggravation, the court found that the murder was willful,\ndeliberate, and premeditated, with express malice aforethought, and was gang\nrelated. The court also listed, in some detail, defendant‟s long and violent history\nof other criminal activity while incarcerated. The court found there was no\nevidence to show defendant committed the murder under the influence of extreme\nmental or emotional disturbance or that he acted under extreme duress or the\nsubstantial domination of another. With respect to factors that might extenuate the\ngravity of the crime (§ 190.3, factor (k)), the court noted defendant‟s traumatic\nchildhood, physical, mental and sexual abuse, his diagnosis of bipolar disorder,\nand the failure of prison authorities to consistently provide him with medication.\n\n                                          92\n\fNonetheless, the court concluded: “While it is easy to feel great sympathy for the\ndefendant as a child, and it appears clear that the defendant should have received\nbetter mental health supervision in prison, it also appears that these factors had\nlittle to do with his decision to kill.”\n       Although defendant frames his claim as a failure of the trial court to\nconsider his mitigating evidence, his claim, in essence, is that the trial court failed\nto give sufficient weight to evidence of duress and his mental health issues. His\ncontention does not reflect a valid appellate challenge to the trial court‟s decision.\n(See People v. Abilez (2007) 41 Cal.4th 472, 530 [The fact that the trial court “did\nnot find defendant‟s proffered mitigating evidence as persuasive as he would have\nliked does not undermine” the conclusion that the court properly conducted an\nindependent reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating evidence].)\nAccordingly, even were the claim not forfeited by defendant‟s failure to object, we\nwould affirm the trial court‟s ruling.\n\n       I. International Law\n       Contrary to defendant‟s assertion, “California‟s death penalty law does not\nviolate international law and norms or evolving standards of decency.” (People v.\nCage, supra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 297.)\n\n       J. Disproportionality of the Death Sentence\n       Defendant contends his death sentence is unconstitutionally\ndisproportionate to the offense and the offender. “[W]hen a defendant requests\nintracase proportionality review, . . . we review the particular facts of the case to\ndetermine whether the death sentence is so disproportionate to the defendant‟s\npersonal culpability as to violate the California Constitution‟s prohibition against\ncruel or unusual punishment.” (People v. Wallace, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1099.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           93\n\f       “ „To determine whether a sentence is cruel or unusual as applied to a\nparticular defendant, a reviewing court must examine the circumstances of the\noffense, including its motive, the extent of the defendant‟s involvement in the\ncrime, the manner in which the crime was committed, and the consequences of the\ndefendant‟s acts. The court must also consider the personal characteristics of the\ndefendant, including age, prior criminality, and mental capabilities. [Citation.]‟\n[Citation.] „If the court concludes that the penalty imposed is “grossly\ndisproportionate to the defendant‟s individual culpability” [citation], or, stated\nanother way, that the punishment “ „ “shocks the conscience and offends\nfundamental notions of human dignity” ‟ ” [citation], the court must invalidate the\nsentence as unconstitutional.‟ ” (People v. Virgil (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1210, 1287.)\n       Defendant‟s disproportionality argument emphasizes evidence that (1) he\nwas manipulated and ordered to kill Addis, (2) prison authorities failed to provide\nconsistent treatment for his bipolar disorder, and (3) he suffered a traumatic\nchildhood. The only evidence he cites to support his claim of manipulation is\nexpert testimony that he was easily manipulated; there is no evidence he was\nmanipulated in this case. With respect to his claim that he was ordered to kill\nAddis, the fact that another gang member may have been the shot-caller does not\nmitigate defendant‟s culpability in this case. After defendant savagely attacked\nAddis, defendant lay giggling and laughing on the ground. In a subsequent letter,\ndefendant wrote that the killing “kinda put me at ease, had to earn it,” and that\ncommitting the murder would elevate his status with higher ranking gang\nmembers. Based on this evidence, it appears he was a hit man for the gang rather\nthan a pawn. In support of his theory of manipulation and duress, defendant\nasserts that prison officials knew Addis would be assaulted if he came into the\nyard, and he observes that he was not the person who demanded that Addis be\n\n\n\n                                          94\n\fbrought out, but he does not explain how these facts would diminish his role in the\nmurder.\n       With respect to treatment for defendant‟s bipolar disorder, although it is\ntrue there was evidence prison officials did not consistently provide defendant\nwith certain psychotropic medications, it is also true, as the People point out, that\nthere was evidence both that defendant denied he had any mental health issues and\nsometimes refused such medications. Thus, defendant‟s assertion that his criminal\nactivity in prison merely “resulted from the denial of treatment for long-standing\nmental health issues” is not persuasive.\n       Finally, with respect to defendant‟s traumatic childhood, although his\nchildhood was characterized by abuse and neglect, there was also considerable\nfamily support offered to him by his grandparents.\n       The evidence reflects that defendant, a member of a prison gang, with a\nlong history of violence while incarcerated, committed a vicious, unwarranted,\nsurprise attack on an unarmed fellow inmate, causing his victim to bleed to death.\nConsidered together with defendant‟s personal circumstances, we cannot conclude\nthat the imposition of the death penalty shocks the conscience or offends\nfundamental notions of human dignity.\n       Defendant also invokes sections 1181, subdivision 7, and 1260 as authority\nfor this court to reduce his sentence from death to life imprisonment without the\npossibility of parole.21 “But under those sections, „we lack the power to overturn\n\n21     Section 1181, subdivision 7, states that a court may grant a new trial motion\n“[w]hen the verdict or finding is contrary to law or evidence, but in any case\nwherein authority is vested by statute in the trial court or jury to recommend or\ndetermine as a part of its verdict or finding the punishment to be imposed, the\ncourt may modify such verdict or finding by imposing the lesser punishment\nwithout granting or ordering a new trial, and this power shall extend to any court\nto which the case may be appealed.”\n                                                           (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                           95\n\fa judgment of death simply because we disagree with the jury‟s penalty\ndetermination‟ [citation], and we may only reverse the judgment if we find\n„prejudicial error or legal insufficiency of evidence [citation].‟ ” (People v.\nLeonard (2007) 40 Cal.4th 1370, 1427.) We find neither of those circumstances.\n\n        K. Asserted Cumulative Error\n        Defendant contends the cumulative weight of asserted errors occurring at\nhis trial requires reversal. We have not affirmatively concluded that any errors\noccurred, and in those instances in which we have assumed an error, have\nconcluded any error was harmless. Even when considered cumulatively, the\nassumed errors could not have deprived defendant of a fundamentally fair trial.\n                          IV. NONCAPITAL SENTENCING CLAIM\n        Defendant contends the trial court erroneously imposed a one-year sentence\nenhancement for use of a deadly weapon (former § 12022, subd. (b)(1)\n(hereinafter section 12022(b)(1)) on count 3, the assault on Joseph Matthews\n(§ 4500) because use of a deadly weapon was an element of defendant‟s offense.\nWe agree.22\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\n       Section 1260 provides that “[t]he court may reverse, affirm, or modify a\njudgment or order appealed from, or reduce the degree of the offense or attempted\noffense or the punishment imposed, and may set aside, affirm, or modify any or all\nof the proceedings subsequent to, or dependent upon, such judgment or order, and\nmay, if proper, order a new trial and may, if proper, remand the cause to the trial\ncourt for such further proceedings as may be just under the circumstances.”\n22     Defendant did not object to the imposition of the enhancement at trial, but\nargues that the trial court‟s action constituted an unauthorized sentence that is\nsubject to correction at any time without objection. (See People v. Cunningham\n(2001) 25 Cal.4th 926, 1044.) On that basis, we review the claim.\n\n\n\n                                          96\n\f       At the time of trial, section 12022(b)(1) stated: “Any person who\npersonally uses a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission or attempted\ncommission of a felony shall, upon conviction of that felony or attempted felony,\nin addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or\nattempted felony of which he or she has been convicted, be punished by an\nadditional term of one year, unless use of a deadly or dangerous weapon is an\nelement of the offense of which he or she was convicted.” (Italics added.) As a\ngeneral rule, “[t]he phrase „element of the offense‟ signifies an essential\ncomponent of the legal definition of the crime, considered in the abstract.”\n(People v. Hansen (1994) 9 Cal.4th 300, 317, italics omitted, overruled on another\nground in People v. Chun (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172, 1199.) In Hansen, the\ndefendant was convicted of second degree felony murder, based on the underlying\nfelony of discharging a firearm into an inhabited dwelling. We concluded the\nfirearm use enhancement could be imposed on the defendant‟s conviction, because\nthe crime of second degree murder, “considered in the abstract, does not include\nuse of a firearm as an element. Second degree murder may be committed in a\nmyriad of ways, some that involve use of a firearm, and others, such as stabbing,\npoisoning or strangling, that do not involve use of this type of weapon. Under\n[former] section 12022.5, subdivision (a), the enhancement applies unless „use of a\nfirearm is an element of the offense,‟ and not merely the means by which the\noffense was committed or the factual predicate of a theory upon which the\nconviction was based.” (Hansen, at p. 317.)\n       Defendant acknowledges Hansen, but contends the facts of this case come\nwithin the reasoning of People v. McGee (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 107 (McGee).\nMcGee stabbed his victim with a knife, and was convicted under former section\n245, subdivision (a)(1) (section 245(a)(1)), which applied to “ „an assault . . . [1]\nwith a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm or [2] by any means of\n\n                                          97\n\fforce likely to produce great bodily injury . . . .‟ ” (McGee, at p. 112, fn. 2) The\ntrial court imposed an enhancement under section 12022(b)(1) for use of a deadly\nweapon, which the Court of Appeal struck.\n       The appellate court in McGee acknowledged that the phrase “ „element of\nthe offense‟ ” in the enhancement statute means “ „an essential component of the\nlegal definition of the crime considered in the abstract.‟ ” (McGee, supra, 15\nCal.App.4th at p. 114, italics omitted.) It also observed that section 245(a)(1)\nspecified two forms of prohibited conduct, assault with a deadly weapon other\nthan a firearm and assault by means of force likely to produce great injury.\nTherefore, section 245(a)(1) could be violated without using a deadly weapon.\n(Ibid.) The court further observed, however, that the statute “ „defines only one\noffense, to wit “assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or\ninstrument [other than a firearm] or by any means of force likely to produce great\nbodily injury . . . .” The offense of assault by means of force likely to produce\ngreat bodily injury is not an offense separate from . . . the offense of assault with a\ndeadly weapon.‟ [Citation.] Consequently, in determining whether use of a\ndeadly weapon other than a firearm is an element of a section 245, subdivision\n(a)(1) conviction, the question is not simply whether, in the abstract, the section\ncan be violated without using such a weapon. Rather, the conduct of the accused,\ni.e., the means by which he or she violated the statute, must be considered.”\n(McGee, supra, 15 Cal.App.4th at pp. 114-115.)\n       Applying these observations to the facts before it, the court in McGee\nconcluded: “Here, defendant‟s use of a deadly weapon other than a firearm was\nthe sole means by which he violated section 245, subdivision (a)(1). The assault\nby means of force likely to produce great bodily injury was defendant‟s stabbing\nof the victim with a knife. Hence, his use of the weapon was an element of the\noffense, within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b), even though the\n\n                                          98\n\fcrime was pleaded as an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily\ninjury rather than as an assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm.”\n(McGee, supra, 15 Cal.App.4th at p. 115.) The court also noted that the\nprosecutor had pleaded the offense as an assault by means of force likely to\nproduce great bodily injury rather than an assault with a deadly weapon to “evade\nthe statute‟s exception and to increase the punishment imposed on defendant.”\n(Id. at p. 116.) If prosecutors were allowed to “divide section 245, subdivision\n(a)(1) into two separate offenses regardless of the defendant‟s conduct, . . .\nsimilarly situated defendants who assaulted their victims with deadly weapons\nother than firearms and were charged with violating section 245, subdivision (a)(1)\ncould receive disparate punishment depending solely upon the language used in\nthe pleadings. . . . This is an absurd and unjust result which is inconsistent with\nthe legislative intent in enacting sections 245, subdivision (a)(1) and 12022,\nsubdivision (b).” (Id. at p. 117.)\n       Section 4500 is similar to the version of section 245 considered in McGee,\nsupra, 5 Cal.App.4th 107, in that section 4500 refers to a person “who, with\nmalice aforethought, commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly\nweapon or instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily\ninjury.” (Italics added.) Thus, as was true of former section 245, subdivision\n(a)(1), section 4500 defines a single offense that can be committed in one of two\nways, by use of a deadly weapon or instrument or by any means of force likely to\nproduce great bodily injury. Whether in a particular case, the use of a deadly\nweapon or instrument was an element of the offense cannot be answered in the\nabstract; “the conduct of the accused, i.e., the means by which he or she violated\nthe statute, must be considered.” (McGee, supra, 15 Cal.App.4th at p. 115.)\n       In this case, not only did the evidence show defendant used a razor to cut a\ngash in Matthews‟s back, but with respect to count 3, the jury was specifically\n\n                                          99\n\finstructed: “In order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be\nproved: (1) A person was assaulted; [¶] (2) The assault was committed with a\ndeadly weapon or instrument . . . .” Thus, in the particular circumstances of this\ncase, the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon was an element of defendant‟s\noffense under section 4500, barring imposition of the use enhancement set forth in\nsection 12022 (b)(1).\n       The People‟s attempts to distinguish McGee are unpersuasive. The People\ncontend that McGee contradicts the public policy of punishing more severely those\nwith a greater degree of culpability. The case they cite for this proposition, People\nv. Murray (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1783, involved consecutive sentencing for mixed\nfelony and misdemeanor convictions and not the enhancement at issue here; its\npublic policy observation arises in that specific, and distinguishable, context. (Id.\nat pp. 1787-1788.) Moreover, the public policy considerations that underlie\nsection 12022(b) were discussed at length in McGee, which examined the\nLegislature‟s intent in enacting the enhancement. McGee concluded that where\n“ „the Legislature has fixed the punishment for an assault where a deadly weapon\nis used, . . . it is not to be supposed that for the same offense without any\nadditional factor existing the added punishment should be imposed.‟ ” (McGee,\nsupra, 15 Cal.App.4th at p. 116, quoting In re Shull (1944) 23 Cal.2d 745, 751.)\nThis observation applies with equal force to section 4500.\n       The People also argue that McGee has been limited to the specific facts of\nthat case, citing a footnote in People v. Ross (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1151. In Ross,\nthe trial court stayed imposition of a firearm use enhancement (former § 12022.5,\nsubd. (b)), where defendant had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter by\nshooting the victim. The trial court reasoned that the use of the firearm was\nidentical to the “ „crime itself‟ ” and thus section 654 precluded defendant from\nbeing punished twice for the same act. (Ross, at p. 1155.) The Court of Appeal\n\n                                         100\n\freversed because firearm use was not an element of voluntary manslaughter. In\nthis connection, it distinguished McGee, noting that the statute at issue there,\nassault with a deadly weapon (§ 245(a)(1)), “had two alternative forms, as to one\nof which weapons use was an element,” and for that reason “has no application to\nthis case.” (Ross, at p. 1156, fn. 7.) As noted above, section 4500 is analogous to\nsection 245(a)(1), and, therefore, McGee’s reasoning is equally applicable.\n       Accordingly, we strike the enhancement for use of a dangerous or deadly\nweapon from count 3.\n                                  V. CONCLUSION\n       The enhancement for use of a dangerous or deadly weapon is stricken from\ncount 3, and the judgment is otherwise affirmed.\n\n\n                                                        CANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt Phase\n\n            1. Prosecution Case\n\n               a. Fatal Attack on Daniel Addis (Counts 1 and 2)\n       In August 1997, defendant and the homicide victim, Daniel Addis, were\ninmates at the California Institution for Men in Chino and housed in the\nadministrative segregation unit (ASU). That housing unit is reserved for inmates\nwho present safety or management concerns, including inmates awaiting\nadjudication for violations of prison rules. Defendant, who was serving a sentence\nof 25 years to life under the “Three Strikes law”, was a member of a White\nsupremacist gang called the Nazi Lowriders (NLR), as was his cellmate Gary\nGreen. Defendant and Green were housed on tier 3 of ASU.\n       Addis, who was not a gang member, had been placed in ASU for assaulting\na staff member. He had previously been housed on tier 3, but in July, he had\nasked to be moved to another tier. He told the guard to whom he made the request\nthat he had stolen tobacco from NLR gang members. Commission of this offense\nby one who was not a member of the gang would have resulted in retaliation from\nthe gang. Addis was moved off tier 3 and eventually housed in a single cell on tier\n1 of ASU.\n       Although Addis was housed on a tier different from defendant and other\nNLR members, he exercised in the same yard, one of four that were segregated by\nrace and gang affiliation. The procedure for moving inmates from their cells to\nthe exercise yards involved stringent security protocols. The yard was searched\nfor weapons before any inmate was allowed to enter. In addition, the inmates\n\n\n                                         2\n\fwere subjected to repeated searches before they were allowed into the yard. These\nincluded a visual strip search in their cells, passing through a metal detector, a\nhand search of their person and effects and a final search by a hand-held metal\ndetector before they were admitted to the yard one at a time. As part of the strip\nsearch, they were required to squat and cough to determine if they were trying to\nsmuggle contraband in their rectums. Once allowed into the yard, inmates were\nrequired to line up against the fence until all inmates were in the yard.\nCorrectional officers in the guard tower could observe all four exercise yards.\n       On Sunday, August 3, 1997, all of the White inmates, except Addis, had\nentered their exercise yard. Defendant‟s cellmate, Gary Green, who was a “shot\ncaller” and leader of the NLR gang, started yelling at the gate guard, Rosamaria\nMaldonado, to let Addis out into the yard. Inmates were subject to monthly\nclassification reviews to determine, among other matters, whether they were\neligible for the yard. If they were eligible, each decided whether to avail himself\nof the yard privilege. Addis was eligible to go into the yard and had done so the\nprevious Thursday without incident.\n       Maldonado went to her superior, Sergeant Arioma Sams, and told him the\nother inmates were demanding that Addis be brought out into the yard. Sams\ntestified that he checked the yard for unusual activity but did not observe any.\nTimothy Ginn, another guard on duty that day, testified he told Sams that if Addis\nwent out into the yard he might get “beat up.” Sams replied that their hands were\ntied because Addis had a right to go into the yard if he wanted to. Ginn told Addis\n“you don‟t have to go if you don‟t want to.” Addis replied, “Fuck that. I want to\ngo.” Laramie McAlmond, another guard, testified that she overheard Ginn‟s\nconversation with Addis and confirmed that Addis said he wanted to go out to the\nyard. She testified that Addis said, “Everything‟s squashed,” which is prison slang\nfor everything is settled and there are no problems.\n\n                                          3\n\f        Addis was released into the yard at 9:30 or 9:45 a.m., about 30 to 45\nminutes after defendant and Green had entered the yard. Officer Frank Esqueda,\none of the two tower guards on duty, testified that Addis joined the other inmates\nin exercises, and then walked around and talked to a few inmates. Esqueda\nobserved Green and defendant walking back and forth and talking, but despite the\nfact that Green had demanded that Addis be brought out, Green initially ignored\nAddis. Green acknowledged Addis at 11:15 a.m., when the showers typically\nwere turned on. Green and Addis were standing by the showers, and Green shook\nhis hand and told him, “It‟s all right, Danny. Go ahead and play cards.” Addis\nthen walked to a card table and sat down to play pinochle with other inmates.\nAbout 10 or 15 minutes later, Green and defendant walked from the showers to the\ntable, talking back and forth. When they arrived at the table, defendant stood to\nthe left of Addis, and Green stood to the left of defendant. One or two minutes\nlater, Esqueda saw defendant make a sudden movement with his left hand to\nAddis‟s neck.\n        Another inmate, Ricky Rogers, who was playing at the same table, also\nobserved defendant approach and stand behind Addis. Rogers testified that\ndefendant and Addis had a friendly conversation about a third inmate. Rogers saw\ndefendant raise his arm “real fast,” and then heard a sound like a punch. Addis\nstood up from the table and put his hand to his neck. When he pulled his hand\naway, blood was streaming from his neck. He dropped to his knees and then fell\nover.\n        From the tower, Officer Esqueda also saw Addis reach for his neck and saw\nblood flowing from it. Esqueda ordered the inmates in the yard to get down on the\nground. Everyone complied except defendant and Green, who continued running\nacross the yard. Defendant and Green complied only after Esqueda fired a “gas\nlauncher” that shot a wooden baton block into the yard. When defendant went on\n\n                                          4\n\fthe ground, a weapon popped out of his left hand and landed in front of him. At\ntrial, the weapon was described as a stabbing instrument consisting of a sharpened\npiece of metal covered by a sheath made from cellophane and cardboard and\nwrapped with string.\n       Addis was removed from the yard bleeding profusely, and died en route to\nthe hospital. An autopsy established the cause of death was massive blood loss\ncaused by the severance of his jugular and subclavian veins. A great deal of force\nwas required to inflict the fatal wound.\n       After Addis was removed from the yard, correctional officers cleared it of\nthe inmates one at a time. The inmates remained prone until they were removed.\nDefendant‟s left hand and the stabbing instrument found near his hand were\nbloody. Defendant was giggling and laughing as he lay on the ground. Later he\nwas examined and photographed. He had blood on his left hand and boxer shorts,\nbut was uninjured. The stabbing instrument recovered near defendant was\nconsistent with a weapon that would inflict the fatal wound Addis received.\n       Ten days after defendant attacked Addis, he threatened to flood the tier\nwhere he was housed unless he was moved. The officer to whom he made the\nstatement told him he could not be moved because of the ongoing investigation\ninto Addis‟s killing. Defendant replied, “I killed him so I confess. The\ninvestigation is over.”\n       Defendant wrote two letters, one dated September 9, 1997, and the other\nSeptember 22, 1997, to Joseph Lowery, another NLR member imprisoned at\nCorcoran State Prison. Glen Willett, a prison gang expert testified that\ndefendant‟s use of certain phrases identified him as an NLR gang member and that\nother references were to the Addis homicide. The letters are described more fully\nbelow in connection with defendant‟s challenge to the letters‟ admission into\nevidence. (See post, pp. 34-40.)\n\n                                           5\n\f               b. Attack on Joseph Matthews (Count 3)\n       On September 18, 1997, Officers Lourenco and Perez were escorting\ninmate Joseph Matthews from the showers to his cell when defendant called out\nfrom his cell, “Joe, want a cigarette.” Matthews broke away from the officers and\nran toward defendant‟s cell. Matthews, whose hands were cuffed behind his back,\nturned his back toward defendant‟s cell door and put his hands at the porthole\nopening of the door, reaching for something. Neither officer saw any object being\ntransferred. A moment later, Matthews stepped away and said, “I‟m cut.”\nMatthews‟s back was bleeding from a deep gash 7 to 8 inches long and three-\nquarters of an inch wide. Within seconds after Matthews stepped away from the\ncell door, the officers heard the sound of defendant flushing the toilet. It was\nimpossible to retrieve items flushed down the toilet, but Jeffrey Killian, a medical\ntechnician on the floor, testified that Matthews‟s wound was inflicted with a razor.\nFourteen stitches were required to close Matthews‟s wound. Three weeks after the\nattack, Matthews told an investigator that defendant had pulled out a razor blade\nattached to a toothbrush which he used to attack Matthews, and then flushed the\nrazor down the toilet.\n\n               c. Custodial Possession of a Weapon (Count 4)\n       On October 15, 1997, officers entered defendant‟s cell, of which he was the\nsole occupant, to allow him out of the tier to exercise. When Officer Lopez\nopened defendant‟s cell door, a sharp metal object fell to the floor. Defendant\nsmiled and shrugged. The object was a one-inch long piece of metal, shaped like a\ndagger and known in prison as a “spearhead.” In a subsequent search of the cell,\nofficers also recovered a razor blade that had been removed from the disposable\nrazors given to inmates for shaving.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f               2. Defense Case\n       The defense conceded defendant‟s guilt on counts 3 and 4, the attack on\nMatthews and the possession of a weapon, and focused its efforts on counts 1\nand 2, the killing of Addis. With respect to the attack on Addis, the defense\nargued that defendant acted out of duress because he himself would have been\nkilled if he had not attacked Addis as ordered by Green and the NLR. As a\ncorollary, he maintained that the prison guards knew Addis was going to be\nattacked and allowed it to happen in retaliation for Addis‟s assault on a prison\nguard, thus foreclosing defendant from obtaining protection from prison\nauthorities. Defendant sought to establish his defense through the testimony of\nOfficer Rosamaria Maldonado, the guard who had expressed concern about\nAddis‟s safety to Sergeant Sams, and two prison experts. Defendant himself did\nnot testify.\n       By the time Rosamaria Maldonado testified, she had left the Department of\nCorrections after filing a stress claim seeking workers‟ compensation benefits. In\nthat claim, she cited the Addis killing, among other incidents, as contributing to\nher stress. With respect to the events of August 3, 1997, she testified that Green\nhad been insistent that Addis come out to the yard. She thought Addis might have\nsafety issues if he went out to the yard, and she told Addis, “You must be packing\nfor them because they‟re dying to see you.” By this, she meant that Addis must be\nconcealing drugs or weapons. He looked at her and smiled and she let him out\ninto the yard. After releasing Addis into the yard, Maldonado observed that Green\nmerely nodded and did not greet Addis as he usually did, with a hug and a kiss.\nWhen Maldonado walked back into the building, she told Sergeant Sams, “You\nknow, Sarge, they‟re going to take him out.” Sams responded, “Come on, we got\na lot of work to do.” She and Sams left the area to conduct cell searches. About\ntwo hours later, she heard a gas launcher in the exercise yard. She was one of the\n\n\n                                          7\n\fofficers who responded to the yard to help Addis. In addition, after he was carried\nout of the yard on a stretcher, she rode in the ambulance with him. Addis died as\nshe was performing CPR on him.\n       At trial, Maldonado denied the existence of any conspiracy between the\nguards and Green to kill Addis, and denied that her fear for Addis‟s safety was\nanything other than a “gut feeling.” She had previously been unaware that Addis\nhad been placed in ASU because he had hit a guard. However, according to Dr.\nDavid Friedman, from whom she sought counseling, Maldonado told him that they\nknew “an inmate was to be killed. We all knew it. I told the supervisor that he\nwould be killed if we let him out of his cell.” She also told Dr. Friedman that she\nhad told her sergeant, “They are going to kill him.”\n       Confronted with these statements at trial, Maldonado claimed that\nDr. Friedman had paraphrased what she told him, and that she did not make the\nstatements he attributed to her. She denied telling him “I tried to stop it,” or that\n“They killed him because they thought he was giving information to us, which he\nwas. He used to talk to [Officer] Kaffenberger a lot.” She similarly testified that\nstatements attributed to her by Dr. Donald Feldman, who examined her in\nconnection with her workers‟ compensation claim, were also paraphrases. In the\nstatements attributed to her by Dr. Feldman, she allegedly said she had told\nSergeant Sams an inmate was likely to be killed if they let him out of his cell, and\nthat Sams had shrugged.\n       The defense also called as a witness James Gleisinger, who assisted\nFreidman in worker‟s compensation evaluations. Gleisinger testified that he\ninterviewed Maldonado and set forth in his report Maldonado‟s verbatim\nstatements to him. Among the statements in his report were: “ „She recalls “the\nmost dramatic thing was about 18 months ago an inmate was to be killed. We all\nknew it. I told the supervisor that he would be killed if we let him out of his\n\n                                           8\n\fcell,” ‟ ” and “ „ “That inmate was let out even though everyone knew he would be\nkilled if he was let out. I tried to stop it. That could open up a big can of worms.\nI told my sergeant that they‟re going to kill him. [¶] „She states that Sergeant\nSams “shrugged his shoulders.” ‟ ”\n       Two prison experts testified for the defense. Steven Rigg, a 17-year\nveteran of the Department of Corrections, from which he had retired in 1998 as an\nacting captain, reviewed materials relevant to the attack on Addis and testified that\nthe guards had repeatedly mishandled the situation. In Rigg‟s opinion, Green\nshould have been removed from the yard and disciplined for causing a disturbance\nby demanding that Addis be brought out. Rigg also testified that the guards\nshould have known Green‟s demand that Addis be brought to the yard indicated\ntrouble because Addis was not an NLR member and had been moved to a different\ntier under circumstances that showed he was in trouble with the NLR. The fact\nthat Addis had stolen tobacco and “rolled off the tier” put him at risk. Rigg\ntestified that once Maldonado informed Sergeant Sams that “they‟re going to take\nhim out,” the tower guard should have been instructed to remove Addis from the\nyard. According to Rigg, the fact that Addis was yard eligible should not have\nprevented Sams from removing him from the yard once he received information\nthat Addis might be assaulted or killed. Rigg further testified that Green‟s initial\nfailure to greet Addis, followed by his attempt to engage him, showed a “setup.”\nUnder those circumstances, the tower guard should have ordered the inmates to\nthe ground and searched for weapons when he saw Green and defendant approach\nAddis as he was playing cards.\n       Rigg also testified about prison gangs generally. According to Rigg, if a\ngang member received an order from a gang leader to carry out an assault, he was\nexpected to do so. If he failed, the inmate would put himself at risk to be assaulted\nor killed. Further, after carrying out the assault, the gang would expect the inmate\n\n                                          9\n\fnot to show any concern for the victim. To do so would be considered a sign of\nweakness.\n       Applying these observations to defendant‟s situation, Rigg opined that, had\ndefendant failed to assault Addis, he would have been “a walking dead man.” He\ncould not have obtained assistance from the correctional staff without requesting\nprotective custody, and even in protective custody, inmates have been assaulted\nand killed. Moreover, Rigg testified, the sequence of events showed that Sergeant\nSams “possibly wanted [Addis] assaulted,” in that Sams failed to take action to\nprotect Addis. Furthermore, the light administrative punishment imposed on\nGreen for his involvement in the attack — a 360-day credit loss without a term in\nASU — showed, in effect, that the Department of Corrections “did not punish him\nfor being involved in the conspiracy as charged, yet they found him guilty.”2\n       Anthony L. Casas also testified as a prison expert. Casas had worked for\nover 22 years in the Department of Corrections, retiring as associate warden at San\nQuentin. He was particularly involved in dealing with prison gangs. Casas\ntestified that inmates become involved in prison gangs in various ways. A gang\nmay offer a new inmate protection in return for which the inmate will be expected\nto do the gang‟s bidding. If the inmate refuses, the gang will tell him he cannot\ndisrespect the gang after it helped him. While some inmates who are big and\n\n2       Sergeant Sams accused Green of involvement in a conspiracy to assault\nAddis, and of ordering the “hit” on Addis. The hearing officer found the\nallegations to be true. On Ocrober 10, 1997, Green was given a warning and a\nreprimand, and was assessed 360 days of credit. He was also referred to the\ninstitutional classification committee for a program review and to the Bureau of\nPrison Terms (now Board of Parole Hearings) regarding his rule violation.\nSergeant Sams did not recommend that Green be given a term in a security\nhousing unit or any other special type of confinement. Green was paroled on\nOctober 30, 1997, 20 days after this punishment was imposed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fstrong may be able to avoid gangs, someone like defendant, who is five feet six\ninches tall, and then weighed 150 pounds, might need the gang‟s protection.\nAdditionally, an inmate serving a long prison term will do what he can to be\nprotected in prison.\n          Casas testified that with most gangs, the only way out is death. If a gang\norders a member to commit a crime and he fails to do so, “[h]e can easily be\nkilled. As a matter of fact, in most cases where your gangs are disciplined enough,\nthat‟s precisely what happens . . . . You follow or you‟re gone.” Once an inmate\nhas carried out an order to commit an assault, he is expected to show pride and\nbrag about the crime. Any show of regret would be seen as a sign of weakness,\nand the inmate could be thrown out of the gang or killed. Casas testified further\nthat inmates observe staff. Based on his review of how staff handled Addis, Casas\nopined that an inmate would have concluded it was useless to rely on staff for\nsafety.\n          Like Rigg, Casas criticized the staff‟s handling of the situation in this case.\nHe agreed that once Sams had been warned by Maldonado about the danger to\nAddis, Addis and Green should have been removed from the yard and an\ninvestigation should have been conducted. Like Rigg, Casas testified that Addis‟s\nyard eligibility would not have prevented Sams from removing him from the yard\nonce Sams learned of the threat to Addis‟s safety.\n\n          B. Penalty Phase\n\n              1. Prosecution Case\n          The prosecution‟s penalty case in aggravation relied on multiple incidents\nof prior criminal activity by defendant involving “the use or attempted use of force\nor violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence.” (§ 190.3,\nfactor (b).) To that end, the prosecution presented evidence that, while in prison,\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fdefendant had committed multiple stabbings and attempted stabbings, and assaults\non staff. It also presented evidence of numerous instances of assault and of\npossession of a weapon, all of them independent of those in the current case,\nincluding eight occasions on which he possessed a weapon, four instances of\nstabbing another inmate and one attempted stabbing of another inmate, a battery\non an officer, and an assault on a staff member.\n       Additionally, the prosecutor‟s cross-examination of a defense witness\nbrought out details of defendant‟s juvenile criminal record, which included two\ntheft-related charges. The same witness also testified that when defendant was 19\nyears old, he pleaded guilty to three counts of residential burglary, one count of\nsecond degree burglary, and one count of grand theft of an automobile. In the\nsame proceeding, six other theft-related counts were dismissed. Defendant was\ncommitted to the California Youth Authority for these offenses. The jury also\nheard about defendant‟s plea to one count of escape from the California Youth\nAuthority, after which he was transferred to an adult prison.\n\n           2. Defense Case\n       As described by defendant in his appellate briefing, the defense case in\nmitigation “chronicled [defendant‟s] physical, sexual, and mental abuse as a child\nand the long-term consequences of those experiences, including posttraumatic\nstress disorder, multiple suicide attempts, schizoid personality disorder and bipolar\ndisorder. [Defendant] also presented evidence that his criminal activity in state\nprison resulted from the denial of adequate mental health care and treatment by\nprison staff.”\n       Testimony regarding defendant‟s family history was provided by his two\nmaternal aunts, his maternal grandparents and his father. Both of defendant‟s\nparents were deaf. His mother, Linda, was described as having severe “mental\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fproblems” that manifested themselves in the out-of-control behavior she displayed\nbeginning in adolescence. For example, between the ages of 11 and 13, she set “a\nlot” of fires, including to the garage and to curtains in the living room. She once\nthreatened one of her sisters with a knife. Later, she attacked a pregnant neighbor\nwith a knife while the woman was showering and her husband was mowing the\nlawn. After that incident, she was removed from her parents‟ home and lived in a\nseries of foster homes.\n       Linda married Gary Landry when she was 20 or 21. Their marriage was\nmarked by constant fighting over what Gary perceived as Linda‟s deficiencies as a\nwife and a mother. When Gary learned that Linda was having affairs with women,\nhe painted “bad wife” and “bad mother” on the walls of their residence. Linda\ndrew graphic pictures of women having sex with each other on the walls above\ndefendant‟s crib.\n       Neither parent nurtured or provided the basic necessities to defendant when\nhe was an infant and toddler. Gary was a hard worker, but when he got home\nfrom work, he ignored defendant and instead spent time with his friends in the\ngarage. Linda was a drug user and extremely neglectful mother. When members\nof her family would visit, they would discover defendant alone in his play pen,\nhoarse from crying and yelling. No one had responded to his cries. Linda‟s\nfamily installed a light-flickering system to alert her when defendant was crying.\nThe house was filthy and defendant crawled on a floor littered with broken glass\nand curdled milk. When he was old enough to walk, defendant would get out of\nhis crib and wander the neighborhood. His grandparents, who lived nearby, once\ndiscovered him asleep beneath their car. Another time, he was found scavenging\nfor food in the neighbor‟s garbage cans.\n       When defendant was four years old, he went to live with his grandparents.\nA year later, his mother regained custody, but a few months later she returned him\n\n                                           13\n\fto her parents permanently. When defendant first went to live with his\ngrandparents, he did not talk, but grunted and pointed. He had nightmares and\nhoarded food beneath his bed. When he returned to his grandparents, they took\nhim to mental health professionals because he seemed inaccessible. He continued\nto receive psychiatric care, including hospitalization, throughout his childhood and\nadolescence.\n         Nonetheless, defendant had problems outside the home, starting with being\ndisruptive in kindergarten. He was repeatedly suspended in high school. At 15\nyears old, he and a friend burglarized the friend‟s house. When he was 16 or 17\nyears old, he stole a car, after which he entered the juvenile justice system and\nnever again lived with his grandparents. He spent the rest of his adolescence at\nvarious juvenile camps from which he periodically attempted to escape. During\nthis period, defendant was diagnosed as suffering from atypical depression and\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for which he was medicated. It also\nemerged during his interviews with mental health professionals that he had been\nsexually abused by his father‟s best friend and by a friend of his mother‟s.\nDefendant was described by these mental health professionals as depressed and\nsuicidal. All of these issues were related to the trauma he suffered in his first four\nyears.\n         Defendant‟s adult criminal history began when, at 19 years old, he pleaded\nguilty to three counts of theft-related first degree residential burglary, one count of\ngrand theft auto, and one count of second degree commercial burglary. In lieu of\nprison, he was sent to the California Youth Authority where he was evaluated by\nJames Cueva, a casework specialist, who testified at defendant‟s trial. According\nto Cuevas, defendant was depressed and suicidal, and had no goals, plans, or\nexpectations for life. Cuevas recommended intensive treatment for defendant to\naddress his severe mental and emotional problems.\n\n                                          14\n\f       Dr. Joseph Lantz, a clinical psychologist, interviewed and tested defendant.\nHe reviewed statements by defendant‟s aunts and spoke to his grandparents.\nLantz testified that defendant‟s early years were akin to those of “a feral child,”\nand produced the mental problems that plagued him into adulthood. He diagnosed\ndefendant as suffering from “schizoid personality disorder,” which is characterized\nby a “marked detachment from relationships.” Victims of this disorder prefer\nsolitude to human contact and are easily manipulated by other people. Lantz\ntestified that, despite defendant‟s history, he was not “a character[o]logically\nviolent person.”\n       Dr. Frank Gawin, a psychiatrist, reviewed defendant‟s medical records and\nconcluded that defendant suffered from bipolar disorder. He testified that prison\nofficials were well aware that defendant suffered from this disorder as well as\nother emotional and psychological problems. Both defendant‟s grandmother and\ndefendant himself had written to prison officials and elected officials requesting\ntreatment for his mental health issues. According to Gawin, any treatment\ndefendant received was “entirely inadequate.”\n       Dr. Glenn Lipson, a forensic psychologist, testified about inmate mental\nhealth services in general, as well as defendant‟s particular case. He met with\ndefendant and also reviewed records related to his mental health and treatment in\ncustody. Lipson concluded defendant suffered from schizoid personality disorder\nand bipolar disorder. He testified that prison aggravated defendant‟s mental\ndisease, and he attributed defendant‟s acts of violence in prison to the “diathesis-\nstress model” of behavior, i.e., the violent and stressful atmosphere of\nincarceration pushed defendant, who already suffered from mental illness, “over\nthe edge.” Based on his review of defendant‟s prison records, Lipson testified that\nthe treatment defendant received failed to meet the standards required for inmate\nmental health services.\n\n                                          15\n\f       Finally, Anthony Casas, who had testified at the guilt phase, returned at the\npenalty phase to testify about conditions at Calipatria State Prison where\ndefendant‟s first violent actions occurred. He testified that prison was staffed by\ninexperienced guards and less-than-qualified supervisors. The prison developed a\nreputation as being violent and out of control. Casas also testified that in 2000 he\nattempted to broker a deal in which defendant would provide information about\nthe NLR to prison officials, but the officials concluded his information was stale.\nA similar deal with the Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to materialize\nbecause the San Bernardino District Attorney declined to participate.\n                             II. GUILT PHASE CLAIMS\n\n       A. Review of Sealed Records\n\n           1. Introduction\n       Defendant requests that this court review certain records to which the trial\ncourt denied him access in whole or in part following an in camera review, and\ndetermine whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying him discovery of\nthose records. The records fall into three categories: (1) the confidential\ncorrectional inmate files maintained by the Department of Corrections for Daniel\nAddis, Gary Green and defendant himself (the C-files); (2) the personnel files of\nCorrectional Officers Esqueda, Sams and Maldonado; and (3) additional medical\nand personnel files of Officer Maldonado pertaining to her medical retirement\nfrom the Department of Corrections.\n\n           2. Background\n\n               a. C-files\n       Before trial, defendant served a subpoena duces tecum on the Department\nof Corrections, in which he sought his own C-file. (§ 1326.) Thereafter, he filed a\npretrial motion for discovery in which he requested, among other things, the C-\n\n\n                                         16\n\ffiles for Green and Addis. (§ 1054 et seq.) Defendant argued that discovery of the\nC-files was necessary for him to determine whether the hearing officer who\nconducted Green‟s rules violation hearing arising out of his participation in the\nassault on Addis had relied upon “undisclosed sources.” He contended the files\nmight (1) contain information to support his duress defense; (2) lead to evidence\nthat correctional staff knew, or should have known, about the attack on Addis; and\n(3) disclose whether there were any internal investigations regarding the attack on\nAddis and if any correctional staff had been disciplined as a result of such\ninvestigations.\n       The Attorney General, representing the Custodian of Records for California\nState Prison at Corcoran, moved to quash the subpoena or, alternatively, for the\ncourt to conduct an in camera hearing to determine whether the files should be\ndisclosed. The Attorney General argued that the files were presumptively\nprivileged, and disclosure of them would be contrary to the public interest. (See\nEvid. Code, § 1040, subd. (b)(2) [a public entity may refuse to disclose\nconfidential information if “[d]isclosure of the information is against the public\ninterest because there is a necessity for preserving the confidentiality of the\ninformation that outweighs the necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice”].)\nHe asserted the discovery request was overbroad, and cited the need to protect\nindividuals, such as informants, who would be endangered if their identities were\ndisclosed. He further noted that if informants‟ identities were not kept\nconfidential, inmates would be reluctant to cooperate in investigations. Finally, he\nurged that to protect the privacy rights of prisoners, confidential information\nregarding prisoners should not be released indiscriminately.\n       The trial court agreed to examine the three C-files in camera before trial to\ndetermine what, if anything, in them was discoverable. Following its review, the\ncourt granted defendant partial access to all three C-files, most extensively those\n\n                                          17\n\fof Green, and to a lesser extent, defendant‟s own file. It disclosed a single page of\nAddis‟s file. During trial, defendant renewed his request to examine Addis‟s file\nafter the prosecution turned over to him an incident report detailing Addis‟s\nassault on a correctional officer. The trial court denied the request.\n\n                b. Officer Personnel Records\n       By subpoena duces tecum and an accompanying discovery motion,\ndefendant sought the personnel files of 14 correctional officers. Defendant sought\nmaterial from the files reflecting: (1) lack of credibility;\n(2) “dishonesty/untruthfulness/veracity/false arrest/conduct unbecoming an\nofficer/neglect of duty”; and (3) acts of moral turpitude. The Attorney General,\nrepresenting the California Department of Corrections, moved to quash the\nsubpoena. The trial court preliminarily granted the discovery motion as to\nOfficers Esqueda and Maldonado and Sergeant Sams. It denied the request for the\npersonnel files of the remaining 11 officers based on defendant‟s failure to meet\nthe threshold requirement of good cause for disclosure of police personnel records.\n(See Evid. Code, § 1043, subd. (b)(2); Garcia v. Superior Court (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630625\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630625/garcia-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70-71.)3 The trial court later reviewed the personnel files of Esqueda,\nMaldonado and Sams and concluded they contained no discoverable material.\n\n                c. Records Related to Officer Maldonado’s Retirement\n       After the trial had commenced, the prosecutor informed defense counsel\nthat Officer Maldonado had retired a year after the assault on Addis because of\n“significant emotional and mental health issues” arising from her involvement in\nthat incident. Defendant then served subpoenas on the State Compensation\n\n3      On appeal, defendant does not argue the trial court erred in concluding he\nhad failed to show good cause for the personnel records of the other 11 officers.\n\n\n\n\n                                          18\n\fInsurance Fund (SCIF) and the California Institution for Men (CIM), seeking\nrecords related to Maldonado‟s retirement from the Department of Corrections.\nThe Attorney General, representing the California Department of Corrections,\nopposed the discovery request, arguing that the records were part of Maldonado‟s\npolice personnel files as to which the court had already found no discoverable\nmaterial.\n       The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion. It stated it had received\nrecords from SCIF and CIM related to Maldonado‟s retirement. Additionally, the\nrecords of Dr. Friedman, the psychiatrist who examined Maldonado in connection\nwith her retirement, were produced by Dr. Friedman in response to a defense\nsubpoena. Following an in camera review of the records, the court allowed\ncounsel for both parties to copy any records from the Friedman file they found\nrelevant. It denied the discovery motion as to the SCIF and CIM records, finding\nthere was nothing relevant in those records that was not also contained in the\nFriedman file. Defendant later sought to discover records of an investigation into\nMaldonado‟s workers‟ compensation claim made by an entity called Singleton\nInvestigations at the request of the SCIF. The trial court reviewed the records and\nfound nothing discoverable.\n\n            3. Discussion\n       Evidence Code section 1040, subdivision (b)(2), authorizes the trial court to\ndecline to disclose confidential records maintained by a public entity when it finds\n“the necessity for preserving the confidentiality of the information . . . outweighs\nthe necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice.” (See People v. Suff (2014)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1059; People v. Avila (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606.) This\nprovision is applicable to prison inmate records. (Ochoa v. Superior Court (2011)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1281.) As the Ochoa court observed, the state has a valid\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\finterest in maintaining the confidentiality of such records to “(1) protect\nindividuals, including informants inside and outside of prison, (2) ensure\ninstitutional security, and (3) encourage candor and complete disclosure of\ninformation concerning inmates from both public officials and private citizens.”\n(Id. at p. 1280.) In addition, disclosure of police personnel records requires a\nthreshold showing of good cause after which the trial court “screen[s] law\nenforcement personnel files in camera for evidence that may be relevant to a\ncriminal defendant‟s defense.” (People v. Mooc (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621789\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621789/people-v-mooc/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1225.)\nIn either case, the trial court‟s ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (Avila, at\np. 607 [no abuse of discretion where trial court withheld access to a witness‟s\nparole records]; People v. Hughes (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581420\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581420/people-v-hughes/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 [“A trial court‟s\nruling on a motion for access to law enforcement personnel records is subject to\nreview for abuse of discretion”].)\n       Defendant asks that we review all records not disclosed to him by the trial\ncourt — the C-file records of defendant, Addis and Green, the personnel records\nof Officers Esqueda and Maldonado and Sergeant Sams, and the files of SCIF,\nCIM and Singleton Investigations related to Maldonado‟s retirement — and assess\nwhether the trial court‟s rulings were proper. “Parties who challenge on appeal\ntrial court orders withholding information as privileged or otherwise\nnondiscoverable „must do the best they can with the information they have, and\nthe appellate court will fill the gap by objectively reviewing the whole record.‟ ”\n(People v.

We have reviewed the record and\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting disclosure of\nthe materials.\n       We also conclude that the trial court‟s inadvertent failure to provide\ndefendant with one document from Addis‟s C-file did not require the court to\nallow defendant to review Addis‟s entire C-file. As noted above, during trial,\n\n                                          20\n\fdefendant renewed his request for access to Addis‟s file after the prosecution\nturned over to the defense an incident report regarding Addis‟s assault on a\ncorrectional officer. According to the prosecution, it had obtained the document\nfrom the person who investigated the assault by Addis, but the prosecution\napparently did not realize the document was relevant until it heard defendant‟s\nopening statement, which reflected a theory that correctional officers were\ncomplicit in the attack on Addis. Because the trial court had also failed to disclose\nthe document, the defense asked to be allowed to review Addis‟s entire C-file to\nsee if it contained other relevant documents. The trial court responded that it had\nreviewed the file two more times, “page by page,” and had discovered that the\nincident report at issue had been attached to a different report that involved a\ndifferent incident. The court further stated that it found no other documents that\nwere discoverable, and it denied defendant‟s request. We find no abuse of\ndiscretion in the court‟s decision and, as noted above, we have reviewed the file\nand found no discoverable documents.\n       Finally, defendant requests that the court allow appellate counsel to review\nAddis‟s C-file in accordance with appellate counsel‟s duty to “preserve evidence\nthat comes to the attention of appellate counsel if that evidence appears relevant to\na potential habeas corpus investigation.” (Cal. Supreme Ct., Supreme Court\nPolicies Regarding Cases Arising from Judgments of Death (2008) policy 3, std.\n1-1.) We decline his request. The files are preserved in the appellate record.\n\n       B. Denial of Motion to Sever Counts\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\nmotion to sever counts 1 and 2 (the attack on Addis) from counts 3 (the attack on\nMatthews) and 4 (possession of a weapon by an inmate). He further contends the\ndenial of severance violated his rights to due process, a fair trial, a trial by jury,\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\fand reliable capital case proceedings. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th, & 14th Amends.;\nCal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, & 17.) His contentions are without\nmerit.\n         In the trial court, defendant argued that separate trials were required\nbecause (1) there was an absence of cross-admissible evidence between counts 1\nand 2 (the killing of Addis) and counts 3 and 4 (the attack on Matthews and the\ncustodial possession of a weapon); (2) the evidence supporting counts 3 and 4 was\nweaker than the evidence supporting counts 1 and 2; (3) consolidation would\ninhibit defendant‟s willingness to testify with respect to counts 1 and 2; (4) the\nEighth Amendment required heightened scrutiny of joinder because counts 1 and 2\nrendered him death eligible; and (5) judicial economy would be served by separate\ntrials because counts 3 and 4 involved distinct incidents and distinct evidence. At\ndefendant‟s request, the trial court also considered an in camera offer of proof\nregarding defendant‟s testimony and how consolidation might affect his\nwillingness to testify.\n         In denying the motion, the trial court found that defendant had failed to\nmake an adequate showing of a substantial danger of prejudice. The court found\nfurther that “the four charges involved conduct by the defendant while in prison in\nthe California Institution for Men within a two-month period. Each occurred at\n[the] Palm Hall unit of [the] California Institute for Men. [¶] The offenses are of\nthe same class of crime, either assaultive conduct by a prisoner or the possession\nof a prison-made weapon necessary to commit similar assaults. Each of the\noffenses involved prison-made weapons. Each of the assaults [was] committed\nwith prison-made weapons against fellow prisoners. None of the charges appear\nto be weak in relation to the other. And the prejudice to the defendant would be\nsmall.”\n\n\n\n                                           22\n\f       The joinder of charges is addressed in section 954: “An accusatory\npleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their\ncommission . . . or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or\noffenses, under separate counts . . . ; provided, that the court in which a case is\ntriable, in the interests of justice and for good cause shown, may in its discretion\norder that the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading be\ntried separately or divided into two or more groups and each of said groups tried\nseparately.” The legislative preference for consolidation under either of the two\ncircumstances set forth in section 954 is intended to promote judicial efficiency.\n(People v. Capistrano (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 851.)\n       Defendant presents two theories of error. First, he contends count 4 was\nnot properly joined with the first three counts because count 4, custodial\npossession of a weapon, did not involve assaultive conduct, and therefore was not\nof the same class as count 1 (premeditated murder) and counts 2 and 3 (assault by\na life prisoner). Second, he contends the trial court abused its discretion in\ndeclining to sever counts 1 and 2, which arose from the assault on Addis, from\ncounts 3 and 4, which arose from the assault on Matthews and the possession of a\nweapon.\n       Joinder of the four counts was proper because the counts were all of the\nsame class. “Offenses of the same class are offenses which possess common\ncharacteristics or attributes.” (People v. Smallwood (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424,\nfn. 5; see People v.

With respect to the joinder\nof count 4 to the other counts, the trial court noted that all four offenses occurred\nin the custodial context and involved a prison-made weapon. In addition, sections\n4500 (assault by a life prisoner) and 4502 (custodial possession of a weapon) serve\nan identical purpose — to prevent assaults by armed prisoners on prison staff and\nother inmates. (See People v. Custodio (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2289420\"><a href=\"/opinion/2289420/people-v-custodio/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 778 [“Section 4500 was enacted for the purpose of promoting\nprison safety by discouraging assaults by prison inmates”].) Therefore, despite the\nfact that section 4502 does not require an intent to use the weapon (People v.\nRodriguez (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2165304\"><a href=\"/opinion/2165304/people-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395), that offense as charged shares\ncommon characteristics with the assaultive offenses charged in this case, and is,\ntherefore, of the same class.\n       Joinder was also proper because the offenses were “connected together in\ntheir commission.” (§ 954.) “[O]ffenses which are committed at different times\nand places against different victims are nevertheless „connected together in their\ncommission‟ when they are, as here, linked by a „ “common element of substantial\nimportance.” ‟ [Citations.]” (People v. Lucky (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1202336\"><a href=\"/opinion/1202336/people-v-lucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 276.) Here,\nthe common thread among all four offenses is the use or possession by defendant\nof a prison-made stabbing weapon. Defendant contends the common element\nfactor requires that the same weapon be involved in each crime. We rejected a\nsimilar argument in Alcala v. Superior Court (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in which the\ndefendant claimed “only physical or objectively measurable factors, such as use of\na specific individual weapon, can suffice” to establish the common element factor.\n(Id. at p. 1220.)\n       Accordingly, we conclude that count 4 was properly joined with the other\nthree offenses under section 954.\n       In addition, because the evidence that defendant committed count 4 was\nstrong and stood on its own without reference to the remaining counts, the\nevidence related to the other counts would not have improperly bolstered the\n\n                                         24\n\fevidence pertaining to count 4. In light of the strength of the evidence related to\neach charge, “we cannot conclude that it is reasonably probable an outcome more\nfavorable to defendant would have resulted” (People v. McLain (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1350499\"><a href=\"/opinion/1350499/people-v-mclain/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106) if count 4 had not been joined with the other counts. For the same reason,\nany misjoinder did not result in such gross unfairness as to deprive defendant of\nhis right to due process. (People v. Soper (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2624541\"><a href=\"/opinion/2624541/people-v-soper/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 784 [“Appellate\ncourts have found „ “no prejudicial effect from joinder when the evidence of each\ncrime is simple and distinct, even though such evidence might not have been\nadmissible in separate trials” ‟ ”].)\n       As noted, defendant also contends the trial court abused its discretion by\nnot severing counts 3 and 4 from counts 1 and 2. When charges are properly\njoined, a “ „ “defendant must make a clear showing of prejudice to establish that\nthe trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant‟s severance motion.” ‟\n[Citation.] That is, defendant must demonstrate the denial of his motion exceeded\nthe bounds of reason.” (People v. Capistrano, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 848.)\n“ „Refusal to sever may be an abuse of discretion where (1) evidence of the crimes\nto be jointly tried would not be cross-admissible in separate trials; (2) certain of\nthe charges are unusually likely to inflame the jury against the defendant; (3) a\n“weak” case has been joined with a “strong” case or with another “weak” case, so\nthat the “spillover” effect of aggregate evidence on several charges might well\nalter the outcome of some or all of the charges; and (4) any one of the charges\ncarries the death penalty or joinder of them turns the matter into a capital case.‟ ”\n(People v. Romero and Self (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30.) Even if a defendant fails to\ndemonstrate the trial court‟s joinder ruling was an abuse of discretion when it was\nmade, reversal may nonetheless be required if the defendant can demonstrate that\n“the joint trial resulted in such gross unfairness as to amount to a due process\nviolation.” (Capistrano, at p. 853.)\n\n                                          25\n\f       Applying the four-part standard outlined above, defendant first contends\nevidence was not cross-admissible among the four counts. The trial court did not\nexpressly refer to cross-admissibility in its ruling denying severance, but its\ncomments focused on the similarities among the counts — within a two and one-\nhalf month period, while housed in the Palm Hall unit of the CIM, defendant\ncommitted offenses involving prison-made weapons. As defendant acknowledges,\nthe trial court‟s ruling reflects the view that there was a common plan or scheme to\ncommit assaults with prison-made weapons.\n       To be admissible to prove a common plan or scheme, evidence of other\nmisconduct “must demonstrate „not merely a similarity in the results, but such a\nconcurrence of common features that the various acts are naturally to be explained\nas caused by a general plan of which they are the individual manifestations.‟ ”\n(People v. Ewoldt (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196495\"><a href=\"/opinion/1196495/people-v-ewoldt/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 402.) The first three counts involved\nconduct to lull another inmate into a false sense of security followed by a surprise\nattack with a prison-made weapon. The fact that the attack on Addis occurred in\nthe exercise yard in front of numerous witnesses and seemed to involve Green in\nthe plan, whereas the attack on Matthews occurred while defendant was alone in\nhis cell and with no participation by any other inmate, does not negate the\nsignificant similarities. (See Alcala v. Superior Court, supra, 43 Cal.4th at\np. 1225 [the similarity required to admit evidence to prove a common plan “can be\nmet despite the existence of some factual differences between or among the\ncharged offenses”].) Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in implicitly\nfinding the evidence in these three counts to be cross-admissible. Like the other\nthree counts, count four involved the possession of a prison-made stabbing\nweapon. Therefore, the other counts were admissible to establish a common plan\nto possess a prison-made weapon such as the sharpened metal object that fell to\nthe floor when the gate to defendant‟s cell was opened.\n\n                                          26\n\f       In addition, as defendant concedes, “even the complete absence of cross-\nadmissibility does not, by itself, demonstrate prejudice from a failure to order a\nrequested severance.” (Alcala v. Superior Court, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1221.)\nRather, we look to the remaining three factors. (Ibid.) An examination of those\nfactors does not reveal an abuse of discretion.\n       First, none of the joined charges was unusually likely to inflame the jury\nagainst defendant. Defendant asserts the evidence of the attack on Matthews and\nthe possession of a weapon would lead the jury to infer improperly that defendant\n“had a general disposition to violence,” and would “undercut his defense of duress\nand staff complicity and/or negligence in the Addis homicide based on the facts\npeculiar to that case.” The fact that evidence of two violent crimes might lead a\njury to infer that a defendant is violent does not establish that any of the charges\nwere unusually likely to inflame the jury. In addition, to the extent defendant‟s\nattack on Matthews and his possession of a weapon tended to show he repeatedly\nacted pursuant to a common plan rather than due to duress or negligence, or with\nthe complicity of staff, such inferences were proper.4 Finally, as explained below,\nduress is not a defense to murder, nor does duress reduce murder to manslaughter.\n(See post, pp. 42-49.)\n\n\n4       Although it does not appear that the trial court was aware at the time it\nruled on the severance motion of what defenses, if any, defendant would present to\ncounts 3 and 4, we note, for purposes of evaluating whether the joint trial of these\ncharges resulted in gross unfairness, that the defense presented evidence at trial\nthat staff was complicit in the attack on Matthews. In particular, the defense\nelicited testimony from Matthews that he thought the officers allowed him to go to\ndefendant‟s cell and “put [him] in a position for it to happen,” and it presented\nexpert testimony concerning how the officers should have escorted Matthews so\nhe could not get away from them. Also, as noted above, the defense ultimately\nconceded guilt with respect to counts 3 and 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f       Second, counts 1 and 2 were not supported by evidence that was so\nmeasurably stronger than the evidence supporting counts three and four that it\nwould likely have had an improper spillover effect on counts 3 and 4. Defendant\ncontends the evidence of the attack on Addis was stronger because there were\neyewitnesses to it, but the circumstantial evidence that he attacked Matthews was\njust as strong. Defendant called him over, Matthews complied and turned his back\nto the porthole of defendant‟s cell door, and then Matthews staggered away from\ndefendant‟s cell bleeding while guards heard defendant evidently flushing his\nweapon down the toilet. Similarly, the discovery of a prison-made weapon in a\ncell solely occupied by defendant constituted strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe possessed that weapon.\n       Third, “[t]he capital charges were not the result of joinder of the various\nincidents.” (People v. Mendoza (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2594735\"><a href=\"/opinion/2594735/people-v-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162.) Contrary to\ndefendant‟s arguments, we do not apply a heightened standard in assessing\nseverance issues in capital cases. (People v. Trujeque (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 260.)\n       Defendant further contends that the trial court should have granted\nseverance because denial of the motion assertedly prevented him from taking the\nstand. He claims he could have offered a defense to the Addis counts that was\ninapplicable to the remaining counts, but would then have also had to testify\nconcerning the remaining counts.\n       Defendant‟s theory of prejudice has been recognized by federal courts in\ninterpreting their rule of procedure regarding severance, rule 14(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure (18 U.S.C.). We noted in People v. Sandoval (1992)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1236383\"><a href=\"/opinion/1236383/people-v-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, that we have not addressed this theory, and we concluded that the\n“[d]efendant‟s showing fell far short of anything that would have satisfied the\nfederal standards or any standard this court might adopt.” (Id. at p. 174.) We have\nsubsequently considered this theory without adopting it as part of our severance\n\n                                         28\n\fanalysis. (See People v. Johnson (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 752; People v.

Although the federal courts‟ test is based on their\ninterpretation of the federal rule and is not grounded in constitutional mandate, we\nwill assume, without deciding, that the type of prejudice recognized by the federal\ncourts could justify a trial court‟s decision to sever otherwise properly joined\ncharges under California law.\n       Although federal courts have interpreted their rule to permit severance\nwhen a defendant can show prejudice because he or she “ „wishes to testify to one\ncharge but to remain silent on another‟ ” (U.S. v. Archer (7th Cir. 1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504052\"><a href=\"/opinion/504052/united-states-v-darryl-w-archer/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1022), they recognize that “ „severance is not mandatory every time a\ndefendant wishes to testify to one charge but to remain silent on another. If that\nwere the law, a court would be divested of all control over the matter of severance\nand the choice would be entrusted to the defendant.‟ ” (Ibid.) Under the two-part\ntest devised by the federal courts, “severance is required when a defendant\ndemonstrates that he has both (1) important testimony to give concerning some\ncounts and (2) a strong need to refrain from testifying with regard to other counts.”\n(U.S. v. Ely (7th Cir. 1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546136\"><a href=\"/opinion/546136/united-states-v-mark-s-ely/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 457, italics added.) To satisfy the\nsecond part of the test, the defendant must demonstrate that his or her testimony\non the counts about which he or she did not wish to testify was essential to the\nprosecution‟s meeting its burden of proof on those charges. (Id. at p. 460; Archer,\nat p. 1022; U.S. v. Williamson (5th Cir. 1973) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312713\"><a href=\"/opinion/312713/united-states-v-nolan-ray-williamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513.)\n       As noted, the trial court conducted an in camera hearing concerning\ndefendant‟s desire to testify about the Addis attacks and how consolidation might\naffect his willingness to testify. At defendant‟s request, we have reviewed the\nsealed transcript of that hearing. The People have asked that the transcript be\nunsealed in the event it appears the trial court abused its discretion in denying\nseverance. It is unnecessary to unseal the transcript, as defendant has failed to\n\n                                          29\n\fsatisfy the second part of the federal test. There was ample independent evidence\nof his attack on Matthews (count 3) and his possession of the prison-made weapon\n(count 4), quite apart from any testimony he may have offered or declined to offer\nregarding those counts. Accordingly, he fails to show he was prejudiced on this\nground by the trial court‟s denial of his severance motion.\n       Defendant makes several related arguments that can be quickly dispatched.\nFirst, he claims the trial court failed to instruct the jury to consider and decide each\ncount separately, but as he concedes, the trial court did not have a duty to give the\ninstruction without a request. (People v. Beagle (1972) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1166022\"><a href=\"/opinion/1166022/people-v-beagle/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456.)\nSecond, he claims the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing that the jury\ncould indiscriminately use the evidence of all counts to prove each count. But\ndefendant neither objected to the argument, thus forfeiting any claim of\nmisconduct, nor did he request a limiting instruction. (People v.

Third, he claims judicial economy would\nhave been served by severing counts 1 and 2 from counts 3 and 4 because counts 3\nand 4 involved evidence that was not relevant to counts 1 and 2, and “there was\nevery reason to believe that a verdict on the capital/murder charges would have led\nthe parties to reach a disposition on other charges.” Evidence of the counts was\ncross-admissible, as explained above, and he cites no legal authority to support his\nnovel and speculative theory regarding a disposition of the less serious charges.\n       Finally, defendant contends denial of his severance motion resulted in such\ngross unfairness as to amount to a violation of his federal due process rights.\n(People v. Capistrano, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 853.) Other than the asserted\nprejudice we have already discussed and rejected, defendant points to no\nadditional unfairness assertedly resulting from the joint trial. We therefore\nconclude that defendant has failed to show a due process violation as the result of\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fthe denial of his severance motion, or any violation of his rights to a fair trial, a\ntrial by jury, and reliable capital case proceedings.\n\n       C. Juror Questionnaire\n       Defendant contends the trial court erroneously rejected two questions he\nasked to be included on the jury questionnaire pertaining to the prospective jurors‟\nattitudes about aspects of prison life. He contends the court‟s ruling violated his\nstate and federal rights to due process, a fair trial, an impartial jury, and to a\nreliable determination of guilt and penalty in a capital case. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th,\n8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, & 17.)5 The claim\nis meritless.\n\n\n\n\n5       “With respect to this and virtually every other claim raised on appeal,\ndefendant urges that the error or misconduct he is asserting infringed various of\nhis constitutional rights to a fair and reliable trial. In most instances, insofar as\ndefendant raised the issue at all in the trial court, he failed explicitly to make some\nor all of the constitutional arguments he now advances. In each instance, unless\notherwise indicated, it appears that either (1) the appellate claim is of a kind (e.g.,\nfailure to instruct sua sponte; erroneous instruction affecting defendant‟s\nsubstantial rights) that required no trial court action by the defendant to preserve it,\nor (2) the new arguments do not invoke facts or legal standards different from\nthose the trial court itself was asked to apply, but merely assert that the trial\ncourt‟s act or omission, insofar as wrong for the reasons actually presented to that\ncourt, had the additional legal consequence of violating the Constitution. To that\nextent, defendant‟s new constitutional arguments are not forfeited on appeal.”\n(People v. Boyer (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441, fn. 17, applying People v.

We apply this principle here and\nelsewhere where defendant asserts on appeal constitutional claims not advanced\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n                                           31\n\f           1. Background\n       Defendant proposed the following multipart question (question No. 40) to\nbe included in the juror questionnaire:\n       “What are your views on the prison system in the State of California?\n       “A. To what extent can you consider evidence that living in the prison\nsystem, that is to say being a prisoner, is an ongoing experience entirely different\nfrom living in society as you know it?\n       “B. Please indicate which statement best describes your opinion of life in\nthe prison system prior to hearing evidence in this case:\n       “____ Prisoners are safer on the inside that they would be on the outside\n       “____ Prisoners are about as safe on the inside as they would be on the\noutside\n       “____ Prisoners are less safe on the inside than they would be on the\noutside\n       “C. Whatever your opinion as to the safety of living in the prison system\nmay be, how willing are you to consider evidence that many prisoners‟ primary\ntask on the inside is staying alive?”\n       The prosecutor objected to subparts B and C, asserting they were\nargumentative and called upon the prospective jurors to prejudge the case. The\nprosecutor also asserted that the questions were vague as to what was meant by\nprisoner safety. The trial court declined to include subparts B and C. Regarding\nthe latter, even defense counsel conceded it was a “little argumentative,” and\nproposed an alternative the trial court also declined to include. The court\nexpressed its belief that the defense could ask follow up questions to subpart A “to\nget somewhat the same information, assuming it‟s an appropriately asked\nquestion.” At the defense‟s request, a space was provided after subpart A with the\nwords “Please explain.” In its final form, subpart A (renumbered question No. 96,\n\n\n                                          32\n\fsubpart b on the questionnaire) read: “Would you be willing to consider evidence\nthat living in the prison system, that is to say, being a prisoner, is an ongoing\nexperience entirely different from living in society as you know it? Please\nexplain.”\n\n            2. Discussion\n       Defendant contends the trial court‟s rejection of his questions regarding\nprisoner safety denied him the opportunity to “expose juror bias about prison\ninmate safety and survival, to lay the foundation for challenges for cause, and to\nexplore prospective jurors[‟] views on issues related to the circumstances of the\ncharged capital offense that would be important to the decision of whether or not\nto impose the death penalty.” As explained below, we find no abuse of discretion.\n       Preliminarily, we dispose of the People‟s claim that defendant forfeited this\nissue because, after further discussion and further revision of the questionnaire,\ndefense counsel agreed the questionnaire could be used. By then, however, the\ntrial court had already rejected subparts B and C, and it would have been futile for\ndefense counsel to renew the argument. Accordingly, we find no forfeiture and\nproceed to the merits.\n       “There is no constitutional right to voir dire per se. Nor is there any\nconstitutional right to conduct voir dire in a particular manner. [Citation.] Rather,\nthe voir dire process serves as a means of implementing the defendant‟s Sixth\nAmendment right to an impartial jury. [Citations.] [¶] Consistent with applicable\nstatutory law, the trial court has wide latitude to decide the questions to be asked\non voir dire [citation], and to select the format in which such questioning occurs\n[citation]. The court likewise has broad discretion to contain voir dire within\nreasonable limits.” (People v. Contreras, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p.143; fn. omitted;\nsee Code Civ. Proc., § 223.) Thus, “ „ “content” questions,‟ even ones that might\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\fbe helpful, are not constitutionally required. [Citation.] To be an abuse of\ndiscretion, the trial court‟s failure to ask questions „must render the defendant‟s\ntrial fundamentally unfair.‟ [Citation.] „Such discretion is abused “if the\nquestioning is not reasonably sufficient to test the jury for bias or partiality.” ‟\n[Citation.]” (People v. Cleveland (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737; see also People v.\nLeon (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586.) It is not the purpose of voir dire to “ „educate\nthe jury panel to the particular facts of the case, to compel the jurors to commit\nthemselves to vote a particular way, to prejudice the jury for or against a particular\nparty, to argue the case, to indoctrinate the jury, or to instruct the jury in matters of\nlaw.‟ ” (People v. Crowe (1973) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1353807\"><a href=\"/opinion/1353807/people-v-crowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 824.)\n       As defendant asserts, the issue of inmate safety and survival was “central to\nthe defense to the capital/murder charges.” The principal purpose of the rejected\nquestions appears to have been to begin educating the jurors about the defense.\nMoreover, as the prosecutor pointed out, the rejected questions were vague in that\nthey did not specify what kind of threats to inmate safety and survival were at\nissue. This vagueness itself created an opening for defendant to fill in the blanks\nwith, again, the objective of previewing the defense and inviting agreement with\nhis view of inmate safety and survival. Finally, the trial court did not foreclose all\nquestioning on this subject, but indicated it would allow the defense to pursue the\nsubject should a prospective juror raise it in his or her answer to subpart A.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the trial court acted well within its discretion in\nrejecting the questions. We conclude further that the rejection of the proposed\nquestions did not implicate the issue of death-qualification voir dire. (See\nWainwright v.

Admission of Defendant’s Letters\n       Defendant contends the admission of jailhouse letters he wrote to another\nNLR gang member violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due\nprocess, a fair trial, a trial by jury, and to reliable capital proceedings. (U.S.\nConst. 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16,\n17.) We disagree.\n\n           1. Background\n       Prison officials intercepted two letters defendant wrote to fellow NLR gang\nmember, Joseph Lowery, who had once been defendant‟s cellmate. The officials\nphotocopied the letters and then allowed them to be delivered to Lowery. The two\nletters were denominated People‟s exhibits Nos. 66 and 67. Exhibit No. 66\nconsisted of a photocopied envelope and a letter dated September 9, 1997, sent\nfrom CIM, at Chino, where defendant was then housed. The envelope had\ndefendant‟s name, prison number and address. Exhibit No. 67 was an undated\nphotocopied letter that was faxed to David Lacey, the investigating officer in this\ncase, at CIM from an Officer Harrison at Corcoran State Prison on December 22,\n1997, when defendant was housed at that institution. Glen Willett, the\nprosecution‟s prison gang expert, testified that prison authorities monitor prison\ngang members by intercepting their mail and reading it before passing it on.\nLacey testified that outgoing letters by inmates are not allowed to be sealed. First,\nthey are collected and read. If they contain information pertinent to an ongoing\ninvestigation, they are photocopied and the copies passed on to a supervisor.\nFinally, the original letters are delivered to their recipients. That was how Lacey\nobtained defendant‟s letters.\n       Willett, the prison gang expert, testified concerning the contents of the\nletters for purposes of identifying defendant as either an associate or a member of\nthe NLR. With respect to exhibit No. 66, he testified that Lowery was a known\n\n\n                                           35\n\fNLR gang member and that defendant‟s use of the phrase “dawg o‟ mine,” was an\nendearment used among gang members. He testified further that the sentence,\n“Yeah, this 187 kinda put me at ease, had to earn it,” meant that defendant had “to\nwork hard” to commit the “murder,” presumably the Addis homicide, and that\ncommitting the murder would elevate defendant‟s status with higher ranking NLR\ngang members like Lowery. With respect to exhibit No. 67, Willett testified\ndefendant had signed it with his gang moniker “Smurf,” and had made reference to\nbeing relocated. He testified the phrase “so the KGB has been befuddled once\nagain,” referred to prison authorities. He also noted defendant had again used the\ngang phrase “dawg o‟mine,” and well as the phrase “I hope this finds you in good\nhealth and strong mind,” which is a reference to racial purity. Defendant also\nreferred to Gary Green‟s gang moniker, “Mop,” and to an Aryan Brotherhood\ngang member named Joseph Hayes who was then incarcerated at Pelican Bay.6\nWillett also testified that defendant‟s use of the word “homeplate,” was another\ngang endearment that was the “same as „homey.‟ ”\n       Later in the trial, when the prosecutor moved for the admission of exhibit\nNos. 66 and 67, the defense objected that there was no foundation that defendant\nwrote them. The prosecutor responded that the evidence showed Lowery and\ndefendant were cellmates at one point, that defendant‟s prison number and address\nwere written on the envelope in exhibit No. 66, and that “these are self-\nauthenticating letters because of the content” and also because they were signed\nwith defendant‟s gang moniker Smurf. Defense counsel argued there was no\nevidence regarding how prison officials obtained the letters. The prosecutor\n\n\n6     Willett testified that the NLR had begun as a feeder gang to the Aryan\nBrotherhood.\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\fcountered that Lacey‟s testimony regarding the interception and copying of inmate\nletters provided a proper foundation. She acknowledged, however, that it was not\npossible to establish who had originally collected the letters. The trial court\nadmitted the letters.\n\n           2. Discussion\n       Defendant‟s argument regarding the admissibility of the letters is two-\npronged. First, he contends the letters were inadmissible under the secondary\nevidence rule codified in Evidence Code section 1521. Second, he argues the\nletters were not properly authenticated under Evidence Code section 1401.\n       Evidence Code section 1521 provides in part: “The content of a writing\nmay be proved by otherwise admissible secondary evidence. The court shall\nexclude secondary evidence of the content of writing if the court determines either\nof the following: [¶] (1) A genuine dispute exists concerning material terms of\nthe writing and justice requires the exclusion. [¶] (2) Admission of the secondary\nevidence would be unfair.” Enacted in 1998 — and thus applicable to defendant‟s\n2001 trial — the secondary evidence rule replaced the best evidence rule, which\nwas repealed. “Under the secondary evidence rule, the content of a writing may\nnow be proved either „by an otherwise admissible original‟ ([Evid. Code,] § 1520\nor by „otherwise admissible secondary evidence‟ ([Evid. Code,] § 1521, subd. (a);\n[citation]).” (People v. Goldsmith (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269.)\n       Here, as noted, photocopies of the letters and the one envelope were\nadmitted rather than the originals because, as Lacey explained, once the\nphotocopies were made, the originals were delivered to their intended recipient.\nDefendant now asserts the admission of the copies was error. At no time did\ndefendant object to admission of the documents under the secondary evidence\nrule. Rather, his objection went to their authenticity.\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f       “ „As a general rule, “the failure to object to errors committed at trial\nrelieves the reviewing court of the obligation to consider those errors on appeal.”\n[Citation.] . . .‟ This rule applies equally to any claim on appeal that the evidence\nwas erroneously admitted, other than the stated rule for the objection at trial.”\n(People v. Kennedy (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575997\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575997/people-v-kennedy/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612; accord, Evid. Code, § 353.) This\nprinciple applies with particular force here, because before the trial court can\nexclude otherwise admissible secondary evidence, Evidence Code section 1521\nrequires the court to make specific factual determinations. These include whether\na genuine dispute exists concerning material terms of the writing, and whether\nadmission of the evidence would be unfair. The trial court cannot make such\nfindings if a party fails to make a proper, specific, and timely objection, nor can\nwe review the basis of the trial court‟s determination where no findings were made\ndue to defendant‟s failure to have lodged the appropriate objection. Therefore,\ncontrary to defendant‟s view, his various objections to Willett‟s interpretation of\ncertain phrases in the letters did not amount to a proper objection under the\nsecondary evidence rule. Accordingly, the claim is forfeited.\n       As noted above, defendant also contends the letters were not properly\nauthenticated. A writing that qualifies for admission under the secondary evidence\nrule must, nonetheless, be authenticated before it can be admitted. “The\nSecondary Evidence Rule does not „excuse[] compliance with [Evidence Code]\nSection 1401 (authentication).‟ ([Evid. Code] § 1521, subd.(c).) Thus, to be\n„otherwise admissible,‟ secondary evidence must be authenticated.” (People v.\nSkiles (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844276\"><a href=\"/opinion/844276/people-v-skiles/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1178</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1187, fn. omitted; see Evid. Code § 1401, subd. (b)\n[“Authentication of a writing is required before secondary evidence of its content\nmay be received in evidence”].)\n       “Authentication is to be determined by the trial court as a preliminary fact\n([Evid. Code,] § 403, subd. (a)(3)) and is statutorily defined as „the introduction of\n\n                                          38\n\fevidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of\nthe evidence claims it is‟ or „the establishment of such facts by any other means\nprovided by law‟ ([Evid. Code,] § 1400).” (People v. Goldsmith, supra, 59\nCal.4th at p. 266.) “The means of authenticating a writing are not limited to those\nspecified in the Evidence Code. ([Evid. Code,] § 1410 [„[n]othing in this article\nshall be construed to limit the means by which a writing may be authenticated or\nproved‟]; [citation].) For example, a writing can be authenticated by\ncircumstantial evidence and by its contents.” (People v. Skiles, supra, 51 Cal.4th\nat p. 1187.)\n       The testimony of Glen Willett and Officer Lacey was sufficient to sustain\nthe trial court‟s finding of authenticity. Both men testified to the general protocol\nby which inmate letters are monitored and, when appropriate, copied and turned\nover to prison authorities as possible evidence in ongoing investigations.\nDefendant‟s letters were of obvious interest to Lacey, who was investigating\ndefendant‟s attack on Addis. The envelope that was part of exhibit No. 66 showed\nas its return address defendant‟s address, along with his inmate number, and was\nsent while he was at CIM. Similarly, exhibit No. 67, the letter faxed to Lacey in\nDecember 1997 from Corcoran State Prison, was written while defendant was\nhoused at that institution and refers to his having been relocated; he had in fact\nbeen transferred from CIM to Corcoran. The contents of the letter, about which\nWillett testified, lends further support for its authenticity. The reference to a\n“187,” that is, a murder, and the context in which the reference is made, are\ninferentially references to the attack on Addis by defendant, for which he is\nclaiming credit. Other references in the letters, to mutual acquaintances like Gary\nGreen and Joseph Hayes, and defendant‟s familiar tone with the recipient, Lowery,\nhis one-time cellmate, as well as his use of his own gang moniker, Smurf, also\nprovide circumstantial support that he authored the letters. (See Evid. Code,\n\n                                          39\n\f§ 1421: “A writing may be authenticated by evidence that the writing refers to or\nstates matters that are unlikely to be known to anyone other than the person who is\nclaimed by the proponent of the evidence to be the author of the writing.”)\n       Defendant argues that all of this information was known to individuals\nother than himself, making it possible that the letters were forged. However,\n“ „[a]s long as the evidence would support a finding of authenticity, the writing is\nadmissible. The fact conflicting inferences can be drawn regarding authenticity\ngoes to the document‟s weight as evidence, not its admissibility.‟ [Citation.]”\n(People v. Goldsmith, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 267.)\n       Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nadmitting exhibit Nos. 66 and 67 into evidence.\n\n       E. Excusal of Sick Juror\n       On the day set for closing arguments and instruction, the court, over\ndefendant‟s objection, excused a sick juror and seated an alternate. Defendant\ncontends the trial court‟s decision to replace the sick juror was an abuse of\ndiscretion and also violated his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair and\nimpartial jury trial and a reliable penalty determination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th\n& 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.) The claim is\nmeritless.\n\n             1. Background\n       On the morning of April 18, 2001, the day set for closing arguments and\ninstructions, the trial court informed counsel that Juror No. 10 had called in sick\nwith the flu. The court indicated it was inclined to replace the juror because the\n“flu that‟s going around does not seem to be something that will get well [sic] in a\nday or two.” Defense counsel requested and was granted a recess to review his\njury list and consult with defendant. When the proceedings resumed, defense\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\fcounsel objected to replacing the sick juror and asked the court to wait for a day to\nsee whether the juror had recovered. The prosecutor suggested the court speak to\nthe juror directly. With consent of both counsel, the trial court telephoned the\njuror and put her on speakerphone. The juror reported she had been vomiting all\nnight and did not anticipate recovering that week. The judge asked if she would\nbe available on Monday, to which she said yes, although she acknowledged she\nhad not been to the doctor.\n       After speaking to the juror, the court noted that a delay from Wednesday to\nMonday would result in the loss of three court days. Defense counsel stated “it‟s\nreasonable to wait for that person until Monday.” The trial court, however,\nexcused Juror No. 10 and replaced her with an alternate.\n\n            2. Discussion\n       Section 1089 states in pertinent part that “[i]f at any time, whether before or\nafter the final submission of the case to the jury, a juror . . . becomes ill . . . , the\ncourt may order the juror to be discharged” and replaced by an alternate juror.\n“We review such a decision for abuse of discretion.” (People v. Smith (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2509517\"><a href=\"/opinion/2509517/people-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 348-349.) “The court‟s discretion is not unbounded: it must\ndetermine whether good cause exists to discharge the juror, and its reasons for\ndischarge must appear in the record as a demonstrable reality.” (People v. Roberts\n(1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1249738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1249738/people-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325.) The trial judge is not required, however, to “elicit\nconclusive proof of the length of future incapacitation; judges are lawyers, not\ndoctors.” (People v. Duff (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560, fn. omitted.) Nor must the\nincapacitation exceed a specific length of time. “[I]n the right circumstances, an\nabsence of a day or less may warrant excusal. [Citations.] Whether a juror‟s\nillness can best be accommodated by a continuance or replacement with an\nalternate is a matter committed to the trial court‟s discretion.” (Id. at pp. 560-561.)\n\n\n\n                                            41\n\f       Here, there is no dispute the juror was ill. Although she believed she might\nbe well the following Monday, five days and three court days later, this was\nmerely an estimate on her part. Meanwhile, as defendant acknowledges, the trial\nhad gone on for almost two months and was set to enter its final phase of closing\nargument and instruction on the day the juror called in sick. Whether, as he\ninsists, a three-day continuance would have been reasonable is not the question we\nmust answer. The question is whether, under these circumstances, the trial court‟s\ndecision to proceed with an alternate juror was an abuse of discretion. In light of\nthe uncertainty of the juror‟s prognosis and the crucial point at which the trial had\narrived, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n       F. Claims of Instructional Error\n\n           1. Instructions Regarding Duress\n       Defendant contends the trial court‟s denial of four proposed defense\ninstructions concerning duress violated his federal constitutional rights to due\nprocess, effective assistance of counsel and a reliable penalty determination. (U.S.\nConst., 5th, 6th, 8th and 14th Amends.) The claim is meritless.\n       The defense of duress is set forth in section 26, which states in relevant\npart: “All persons are capable of committing crimes except those belonging to the\nfollowing classes: [¶] . . . [¶] Six — Persons (unless the crime be punishable\nwith death) who committed the act or made the omission charged under threats or\nmenaces sufficient to show that they had reasonable cause to and did believe their\nlives would be endangered if they refused.” As noted above, defendant argued\nthat his attack on Addis, the basis of counts 1 and 2, was committed under duress\nbecause the attack was ordered by the NLR and, had defendant failed to carry it\nout, he himself would have been killed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f       To establish the defense, defendant requested four duress instructions, two\npertaining to the first degree murder charge (count 1) and two to the charge of\nassault by a life prisoner with malice aforethought (count 2.)7 The trial court\n\n7       The four requested instructions were as follows:\n        1. “In this case, you may consider evidence showing the existence of threats,\nmenaces or compulsion that played a part in inducing the unlawful killing of a human\nbeing for such bearing as it may have on the question of whether the murder alleged\nin Count 1 was of the first or second degree. If you find from the evidence that at the\ntime the alleged crime was committed the defendant honestly and reasonably held a\nbelief that his own life was in danger, you must consider what effect, if any, this\nbelief had on the defendant and whether he formed any of the specific mental states\nthat are essential elements of murder. [¶] Thus if you find he had an honestly and\nreasonably held belief that his life was in peril and as a result did not maturely and\nmeaningfully premeditate, deliberate and reflect on the gravity of his contemplated\nact or form an intent to kill, you cannot find him guilty of a willful, deliberate and\npremeditated murder of the first degree.” [¶] Also, if you find the defendant did not\nform the mental state constituting express malice, you cannot find him guilty of\nmurder of either the first or second degree. You may however, find him guilty of the\ncrime of voluntary manslaughter as defined in these instructions.”\n        2. “The distinction between murder and manslaughter is that murder requires\nmalice while manslaughter does not. [¶] When the act causing death, though\nunlawful, is done under the actual and reasonable belief in the necessity to act\nbecause of imminent peril to life or great bodily injury, the offense is manslaughter.\nIn that case, even if an intent to kill exists, the law is that malice, which is an essential\nelement of murder, is absent. [¶] To establish that a killing is murder and not\nmanslaughter, the burden is on the People to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of\nthe elements of murder and that the act which caused death was not done under the\nactual and reasonable belief in the necessity to act because of imminent peril to life or\ngreat bodily injury.”\n        3. “With respect to Count 2, the crime of Assault By A Life Prisoner With\nMalice Aforethought is not committed unless the element of malice aforethought is\nproved. [¶] If you find that the defendant acted under the actual and reasonable\nbelief in the necessity to act because of imminent peril to life or great bodily injury,\nthere is no malice aforethought and the crime alleged in Count 2 is not committed.\n[¶] As to this alleged offense, the burden is on the People to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt each of the elements of the offense and that the act which caused\ndeath was not done under the actual and reasonable belief in the necessity to act\nbecause of imminent peril to life or great bodily injury.”\n        4. “In this case, you may consider evidence showing the existence of\nthreats, menaces or compulsion that played a part in inducing the unlawful assault\n                                                                (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                             43\n\frejected the instructions on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that\ndefendant personally entertained a good faith belief that his action — attacking\nAddis — was necessary because his own life was in danger.\n        Nonetheless, in response to the prosecutor‟s request that the court “say\nsomething about” duress, the court gave a modified version of CALJIC No. 4.40\n(Threats and Menaces) as follows: “A person is not guilty of a crime other than\nAssault by a Life Prisoner as alleged in Count 2 when he engages in conduct,\notherwise criminal, when acting under threat and menace under the following\ncircumstances: [¶] 1. Where the threat and menace are such that they would cause\na reasonable person to fear that his life would be in immediate danger if he did not\nengage in the conduct charged, and [¶] 2. If this person then believed that his life\nwas so endangered. [¶] This rule does not apply to threats, menaces, and fear of\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nupon inmate Addis resulting in death of the inmate as alleged in Count 2, for such\nbearing as it may have on the question of whether that crime was committed. If\nyou find from the evidence that at the time the alleged crime was committed the\ndefendant honestly and reasonably held a belief that his own life was in danger,\nyou must consider what effect, if any, this belief had on the defendant and whether\nhe formed any of the specific mental states that are essential elements of this\nparticular crime. Thus if you find he had an honestly and reasonably held belief\nthat his life was in peril and as a result did not form the mental state constituting\nmalice aforethought, which is an element of the crime, you may not find him\nguilty of said crime. [¶] You may however, find him guilty of the crime of any\nlesser included offenses such as assault with a deadly weapon as defined in these\ninstructions.”\n        Defendant acknowledges the proposed instructions are erroneous in two\nrespects: first, the requirement that a defendant maturely and meaningfully reflect\nupon his or her act had been eliminated from section 189 prior to defendant‟s trial\nand, second, the instruction erroneously stated express malice was required for\nmurder when section 189 states that such malice may be either express or implied.\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\ffuture danger to his life, nor does it apply to the crime of Assault By a Life\nPrisoner as alleged in Count 2.”8\n       We need not decide whether the trial court was correct that there was\ninsufficient evidence to support the requested instructions, because we have since\nheld that duress is not a defense to murder, nor does duress reduce murder to\nmanslaughter.

In\nresponse, we noted that at common law, duress was not a defense to killing an\ninnocent person. (Id. at p. 772.) We further observed that when California\nrecognized the defense in 1850, all murder was punishable by death. We\nconcluded that as enacted, “section 26 effectively adopted the common law”\n(Anderson, supra, at p. 774), thereby barring duress as a defense to murder. In the\ncourse of our discussion, we observed that “[i]f duress is recognized as a defense\nto the killing of innocents, then a street or prison gang need only create an internal\n\n8       The instruction‟s exclusion of the crime of assault by a life prisoner reflects\nsection 26‟s exclusion of “crime[s] punishable by death” from the defense of\nduress. (See § 4500.) In the trial court, defense counsel acknowledged that his\nproposed instructions on the effect of duress on count 2, which charged assault by\na life prisoner in violation of section 4500, was foreclosed by the explicit language\nof section 26. For this reason, we reject defendant‟s claim that the trial court erred\nin failing to instruct that duress could serve as a basis for the jury to reduce count\n2 to assault with a deadly weapon. For this purpose, we assume, without deciding,\nthat defense counsel‟s acknowledgement that section 26 did not apply to count 2,\nand his agreement to the modified duress instruction given, which specifically\nexcluded count 2, did not forfeit the claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\freign of terror and murder can be justified, at least by the actual killer.” (Id. at\np. 777, italics added.)\n       We also rejected the defendant‟s theory that even if duress is not a complete\ndefense to murder, “at least it reduces the crime to manslaughter by negating\nmalice.” (Anderson, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 781.) We noted that for purposes of\nvoluntary manslaughter — an unlawful killing without malice — the absence of\nmalice is limited to two circumstances: “ „ “when the defendant acts in a „sudden\nquarrel or heat of passion‟ (§ 192, subd. (a)), or when the defendant kills in\n„unreasonable self-defense‟ — the unreasonable but good faith belief in having to\nact in self-defense [citations].” ‟ ” (Ibid.) We observed that “[n]either of these\ntwo circumstances describes the killing of an innocent person under duress.”\n(Ibid.) We declined to carve out a third circumstance negating malice, based on\nduress. Unlike a person who has an unreasonable belief it is necessary to kill in\nself-defense, and therefore intends to kill lawfully, “a person who kills an innocent\nbelieving it necessary to save the killer‟s own life intends to kill unlawfully, not\nlawfully.” (Id. at p. 783.) We recognized that policy arguments could be made to\nrecognize duress as a factor reducing culpability, but observed that “because\nduress can often arise in a criminal gang context, the Legislature might be\nreluctant to do anything to reduce the current law‟s deterrent effect on gang\nviolence. These policy questions are for the Legislature, not a court, to decide.”\n(Id. at p. 784.) Defendant sets forth no argument that persuades us to reconsider\nthese conclusions.\n       Defendant seeks to avoid Anderson‟s holding on the basis that Anderson\ndid not consider whether duress may be a defense to murder as a matter of federal\nconstitutional law. He maintains that evolving standards of decency and\nheightened requirements of a reliable death penalty pursuant to the Eighth\nAmendment require recognition of duress as a defense to murder. Defendant does\n\n                                           46\n\fnot cite any case that has so held, and we are not persuaded that his citation to\nlegal commenters represents a national consensus that has developed against the\nrule we announced in Anderson.

The high court has acknowledged, however, that “dealing\nwith crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal\ngovernment, [citation], and [it] should not lightly construe the Constitution so as to\nintrude upon the administration of justice by the individual States.

(Anderson,\nsupra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 774.) California‟s position is consistent with the majority\nof states that have considered the issue and adopted the common law rule. (U.S. v.\nLaFleur (9th Cir. 1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587682\"><a href=\"/opinion/587682/united-states-v-larry-wayne-lafleur-united-states-of-america-v-nick/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205, and statutes and cases cited therein.)\nThe Legislature‟s adoption of the venerable common rule excluding duress as a\ndefense to murder does not implicate a fundamental right. Accordingly, we reject\ndefendant‟s claim that federal constitutional law required the trial court to give the\nrequested instructions.\n        Finally, defendant contends the trial court should have instructed the jury\nthat evidence of duress could negate premeditation and deliberation, thereby\nresulting in second degree murder. (See Anderson, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 784\n[“We agree that a killing under duress, like any killing, may or may not be\npremeditated, depending on the circumstances”].) In Anderson, we concluded this\nconcept was sufficiently addressed by language in CALJIC No. 8.20 (Deliberate\nand Premeditated Murder) instructing the jury that “a killing „upon a sudden heat\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nthreats is present and would immediately carry out the threats if the crime were not\ncommitted . . . .” (La. Rev. Stat. § 14:18(6) available from La. State Legis. Online\nat https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=78335 [as of December 12, 2016].)\n\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\fof passion or other condition precluding the idea of deliberation‟ would not be\npremeditated first degree murder.” (Anderson, supra, at p. 784.) Not only was\nCALJIC No. 8.20 given in this case, but, as noted, defendant received the\nunwarranted benefit of a modified duress instruction. We reject defendant‟s\ncontention that these instructions were inadequate on this point.\n\n           2. CALJIC No. 8.20\n       Defendant contends that the use of the word “precluding” in CALJIC\nNo. 8.20 (Deliberate and Premeditated Murder) in referring to circumstances that\nwould negate the element of deliberation effectively lowered the prosecution‟s\nburden of proof and violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due\nprocess, trial by jury and a reliable penalty determination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th,\n8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.)\n       As given in this case, CALJIC No. 8.20 provided:\n       “All murder which is perpetrated by any kind of willful, deliberate and\npremeditated killing with express malice aforethought is murder of the first\ndegree. The word „willful,‟ as used in this instruction, means intentional. [¶] The\nword „deliberate‟ means formed or arrived at or determined upon as a result of\ncareful thought and weighing of considerations for and against the proposed\ncourse of action. The word „premeditated‟ means considered beforehand. [¶] If\nyou find that the killing was preceded and accompanied by a clear, deliberate\nintent on the part of the defendant to kill, which was the result of deliberation and\npremeditation, so that it must have been formed upon pre-existing reflection and\nnot under a sudden heat of passion or other condition precluding the idea of\ndeliberation, it is murder of the first degree.” (Italics added.)\n       Defendant contends that, in context, the instruction required the jury to find\nevidence that would have entirely prevented deliberation before the jury could find\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\fthe crime to be less than first degree murder, a more onerous standard than\nrequiring merely that the evidence raise a reasonable doubt. He asserts: “The jury\nshould have been instructed that, if it found evidence of a sudden heat of passion\nor other condition sufficient to giv[e] rise to a reasonable doubt of deliberation, it\nmust give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty of first\ndegree murder.” He relies on various legislative, dictionary and judicial usages of\nthe word “precluding” to support his view that the jury would have understood the\nword to mean “prevent entirely.”\n       The People respond that the claim is forfeited by defendant‟s failure to seek\nmodification of the instruction or by his attorney‟s agreement to the instruction.\nAssuming defendant‟s argument challenges the correctness of the instruction and\ntherefore is not forfeited (see § 1259), it is nonetheless meritless.10\n       As defendant acknowledges, we have previously considered and rejected an\nidentical challenge to CALJIC No. 8.20. In People v. Nakahara (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2598792\"><a href=\"/opinion/2598792/people-v-nakahara/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Nakahara), the defendant contended that the word “precluding” in CALJIC\nNo. 8.20 was “too strong and could be interpreted as requiring him to absolutely\npreclude the possibility of deliberation, as opposed to merely raising a reasonable\ndoubt on that issue.” (Nakahara at p. 715.) We concluded that “this instruction is\nunobjectionable when, as here, it is accompanied by the usual instructions on\nreasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence, and the People‟s burden of proof.\nThese instructions make it clear that a defendant is not required to absolutely\npreclude the element of deliberation.” (Ibid.; accord, People v. Pearson (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326; People v.

In considering a claim of\ninstructional error, however, we do not look far and wide for all possible usages of\na word the defendant has singled out as error nor do we focus solely on that single\nword. Rather, “[t]he relevant inquiry here is whether, „in the context of the\ninstructions as a whole and the trial record, there is a reasonable likelihood that the\njury was misled to defendant‟s prejudice.‟ [Citation.] Also, „ “ „we must assume\nthat jurors are intelligent persons and capable of understanding and correlating all\njury instructions which are given.‟ [Citation].” ‟ ” (People v. Sattiewhite (2014)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 475.) This was the standard we applied in Nakahara as is evident\nby our references to the others instructions pertinent to CALJIC 8.20. We apply\nthe same standard here and again reject this challenge to CALJIC No. 8.20.\n\n           3. Implied Malice Second Degree Murder Instruction\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury, on its\nown motion, concerning the lesser included offense of implied malice second\ndegree murder.11 He asserts the error violated his rights to due process and a trial\nby jury, and the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. (U.S. Const.,\n5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.) We find no error.\n\n11      Defendant contends the trial court should have instructed the jury with\nCALJIC No. 8.31 (Second Degree Murder — Killing Resulting From Unlawful\nAct Dangerous To Life), as follows:\n        “Murder of the second degree is also the unlawful killing of a human being\nwhen: [¶] 1. The killing resulted from an intentional act, [¶] 2. The natural\nconsequences of the act are dangerous to human life, and [¶] 3. The act was\ndeliberately performed with knowledge of the danger to, and with conscious\ndisregard for, human life. [¶] When the killing is the direct result of such an act,\nit is not necessary to prove that the defendant intended that the act would result in\nthe death of a human being.” (CALJIC No. 8.31.)\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\f       “A trial court has a sua sponte duty to „instruct on a lesser offense\nnecessarily included in the charged offense if there is substantial evidence the\ndefendant is guilty only of the lesser.‟ [Citation.] Substantial evidence in this\ncontext is evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the\ndefendant committed the lesser, but not the greater, offense. „The rule‟s purpose\nis . . . to assure, in the interest of justice, the most accurate possible verdict\nencompassed by the charge and supported by the evidence.‟ [Citation.] In light of\nthis purpose, the court need instruct the jury on a lesser included offense only\n„[w]hen there is substantial evidence that an element of the charged offense is\nmissing, but that the accused is guilty of‟ the lesser offense.” (People v. Shockley\n(2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403-404, italics added.)\n       A finding of express malice requires evidence of an intent to kill, whereas a\nfinding of implied malice requires only an “intent to do an act dangerous to human\nlife with conscious disregard of its danger.” (People v. Breverman (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198942\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198942/people-v-breverman/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188.) Here, there is no substantial evidence that defendant intended\nonly to commit an action that was dangerous to human life, and did not intend to\nkill. The evidence reflects that Gary Green ordered a hit on Addis, and defendant\ncontended at trial that if he had not carried out the hit, he would have been killed.\nAfter Green demanded that Addis be let into the yard, Green and defendant\nwalked around together in the yard and ignored Addis. Thereafter, defendant told\nAddis, “It‟s all right, Danny. Go ahead and play cards.” Ten or 15 minutes later,\nGreen and defendant walked together to the card table, and defendant stood to the\nleft of Addis. One or two minutes after that, defendant, with one strong blow to\nAddis‟s neck, severed his jugular and subclavian veins. In a letter to another gang\nmember, defendant stated that he had to work to earn this murder, and that\ncommitting the murder would elevate his status with higher ranking NLR gang\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\fmembers. These facts reflect an intent to kill, and cannot be construed to reflect\nonly an intent to commit a dangerous act with conscious disregard of its danger.\n       Defendant directs us to cases in which courts found sufficient evidence of\nimplied malice based on an assault with a knife. (see, e.g., People v. Pacheco\n(1981) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2149734\"><a href=\"/opinion/2149734/people-v-pacheco/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

He also points to evidence that he and Addis\nwere “having words” just before defendant stabbed him, and that Addis had\npreviously threatened harm to defendant. Although it is true that an assault with a\nknife may reflect implied malice, the issue here is whether there is substantial\nevidence that defendant acted with only a conscious disregard for human life. He\ndoes not explain how the evidence he cites — his use of a knife, “words” before\nthe assault, and a threat on some prior occasion — constituted substantial evidence\nthat he acted only with conscious disregard for human life. On the contrary, all of\nthe relevant evidence reflects an intent to kill.\n\n            4. Voluntary Manslaughter Instruction\n       As previously noted, defendant requested voluntary manslaughter\ninstructions on a duress theory that the trial court rejected. On appeal, he contends\nthe trial court had a duty to instruct the jury, on its own motion, regarding three\nother theories of voluntary manslaughter: sudden quarrel or heat of passion;\nimperfect self-defense; and assault with a deadly weapon without malice\naforethought. He claims the trial court‟s failure to do so violated his state and\nconstitutional rights to due process, trial by jury, a fair trial, and a reliable penalty\ndetermination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const. art. I, §§ 7,\nsubd. (a), 15, 16.) The claim is meritless.\n       As noted above in our discussion of defendant‟s claim of instructional error\nregarding duress (ante, pp. 42-49), the element of malice may be negated by\nevidence that (1) the defendant acted in a sudden quarrel or heat of passion, or (2)\n\n\n\n                                           53\n\fthe defendant unreasonably but in good faith believed it was necessary to act in\nself-defense. If either of these circumstances is found, an unlawful killing will be\nvoluntary manslaughter rather than murder. “Only these circumstances negate\nmalice when a defendant intends to kill.” (People v. Manriquez (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634864\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634864/people-v-manriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583.)\n       The heat of passion sufficient to reduce murder to manslaughter “exists\nonly where „the killer‟s reason was actually obscured as a result of a strong\npassion aroused by a “provocation” sufficient to cause an “ „ordinary [person] of\naverage disposition . . . to act rashly or without due deliberation and reflection, and\nfrom this passion rather than from judgment.‟ ” ‟ ” (People v. Carasi (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2640086\"><a href=\"/opinion/2640086/people-v-carasi/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1306.) The belief required to support imperfect self-defense is that\nthe defendant “was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury.” (People\nv. Booker (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369367\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369367/people-v-booker/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 182.) This doctrine is a “ „narrow‟ ” one and\n“will apply only when the defendant has an actual belief in the need for self-\ndefense and only when the defendant fears immediate harm that „ “ „must be\ninstantly dealt with.‟ ” ‟ ” (People v. Rogers (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633651\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633651/people-v-rogers/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 883.)\n       A trial court must instruct a jury regarding lesser included offenses\n“ „ “whenever evidence that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense is\n„substantial enough to merit consideration‟ by the jury [Citations.] „Substantial\nevidence‟ in this context is „ “evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable\n[persons] could . . . conclude[]” ‟ that the lesser offense, but not the greater was\ncommitted.” ‟ ” (People v. Sattiewhite, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 477.)\n       Defendant identifies the same evidence to support each of these two\ntheories of voluntary manslaughter. First, Richard Allen, a former inmate,\ntestified that he heard defendant and Addis “having words” just before the fatal\nattack. Second, one of defendant‟s letters to Joseph Lowery included a statement\nthat the victim had decided to “disrespect me, and threaten harm to me” and “to\n\n                                          54\n\fkill me on the yard.” Undermining this evidence, however, is the fact that Allen\nalso testified that the victim, who was seated at a table playing cards when\ndefendant approached him from behind, did not threaten defendant. Furthermore,\nAllen‟s belief that the two were arguing was based solely on the tone of\ndefendant‟s voice, which “sounded angry.” Finally, Allen did not hear what the\ntwo men were saying to each other. Regarding the letter, defendant did not\nidentify when the alleged threat occurred. This evidence, even if credited, does\nnot begin to demonstrate either provocation for purposes of heat of passion\nvoluntary manslaughter or imminence of danger of death for purposes of imperfect\nself-defense voluntary manslaughter. Accordingly, the trial court was not required\nto instruct on either theory.\n       Last, defendant cites People v. Garcia (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2291235\"><a href=\"/opinion/2291235/people-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in\nsupport of his contention that the trial court should have instructed the jury\nconcerning voluntary manslaughter because there was evidence he committed an\nassault with a deadly weapon without malice aforethought. His reliance on Garcia\nis in vain, that decision having been disapproved by this court in People v. Bryant\n(2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 970, on the very point for which he cites it. In Bryant, we\nheld that a killing without malice in the commission of an inherently dangerous\nassaultive felony “cannot be voluntary manslaughter because voluntary\nmanslaughter requires either an intent to kill or a conscious disregard for life.”\n(Ibid.) Accordingly, this argument is foreclosed by Bryant.\n\n            5. Expert Testimony as Circumstantial Evidence\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury, on its\nown motion, that its instructions on circumstantial evidence applied specifically to\nexpert testimony. He asserts the error violated his federal and state federal\nconstitutional rights to due process, trial by jury, a fair trial, and a reliable penalty\n\n\n\n                                           55\n\fdetermination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal Const., art. I, §§ 7,\nsubd. (a), 15, 16, 17.) The claim is both forfeited and meritless.\n       The trial court gave two standard instructions on circumstantial evidence,\nCALJIC Nos. 2.01 and 2.02, neither of which expressly refers to expert\ntestimony.12 Characterizing expert testimony as a form of circumstantial\nevidence, defendant contends the trial court should have informed the jury that the\n\n\n12      As given here, CALJIC No. 2.01 stated in full: “However, a finding of\nguilt as to any crime may not be based on circumstantial evidence unless the\nproved circumstances are not only (1) consistent with the theory that the defendant\nis guilty of the crime, but (2) cannot be reconciled with any other rational\nconclusion. [¶] Further, each fact which is essential to complete a set of\ncircumstances necessary to establish the defendant‟s guilt must be proved beyond\na reasonable doubt. In other words, before an inference essential to establish guilt\nmay be found to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, each fact or\ncircumstance on which the inference necessarily rests must be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt. [¶] Also, if the circumstantial evidence as to any particular\ncount permits two reasonable interpretations, one of which points to the\ndefendant‟s guilt and the other to his innocence, you must adopt that interpretation\nthat points to the defendant‟s innocence, and reject that interpretation that points to\nhis guilt. [¶] If, on the other hand, one interpretation of this evidence appears to\nyou to be reasonable and the other interpretation to be unreasonable, you must\naccept the reasonable interpretation and reject the unreasonable.”\n        CALJIC No. 2.02, as given here, stated in full: “The specific intent and/or\nmental state with which an act is done may be shown by the circumstances\nsurrounding the commission of the act. However, you may not find the defendant\nguilty of the crime charged in Counts 1, 2, or 3 unless the proved circumstances\nare not only (1) consistent with the theory that the defendant had the required\nspecific intent and/or mental state but (2) cannot be reconciled with any other\nrational conclusion. [¶] Also, if the evidence as to specific intent and/or mental\nstate permits two reasonable interpretations, one of which points to the existence\nof the specific intent and/or mental state and the other to its absence, you must\nadopt that interpretation which points to its absence. If, on the other hand, one\ninterpretation of the evidence as to the specific intent and/or mental state appears\nto you to be reasonable and the other interpretation to be unreasonable, you must\naccept the reasonable interpretation and reject the unreasonable.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\fprinciples expressed in those instructions applied to expert testimony. More\nspecifically, he contends the court should have instructed that “if the expert\ntestimony permitted two reasonable inferences, one of which points to defendant‟s\ninnocence and the other to his guilt, the jury must adopt that interpretation that\npoints to the defendant‟s innocence, and reject that interpretation that points to his\nguilt.”\n          Defendant does not assert that the circumstantial evidence instructions were\nincorrect statements of law. “A party may not complain on appeal that an\ninstruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too general or\nincomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying\nlanguage.” (People v. Lang (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1024; accord, People v.\nLivingston (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1166; People v.

Accordingly, the claim is forfeited.\n          The claim is also without merit. Defendant cites no authority for the\nproposition that a trial court is required to specify the evidence or the issues to\nwhich the instructions regarding circumstantial evidence apply. And for good\nreason: how a general instruction applies to specific evidence or theories is an\nargument for counsel to make.\n\n              6. Refused Modification of CALJIC No. 2.11.5\n          Defendant contends the trial court erred when it denied his proposed\nmodification to CALJIC No. 2.11.5 (Unjoined Perpetrators of the Same Crime).\nHis asserts the error violated his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair\ntrial, to a trial by jury, to present a defense, and to a reliable penalty determination.\n(U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal Const. art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a). 15,\n16, 17.) The claim is meritless.\n\n\n\n\n                                           57\n\f       The trial court gave CALJIC No. 2.11.5 as follows: “There has been\nevidence in this case indicating that a person other than defendant was or may\nhave been involved in the crime for which that defendant is on trial. [¶] There\nmay be many reasons why that person is not here on trial. Therefore, do not\nspeculate or guess as to why the other is not being prosecuted in this trial or\nwhether he has been or will be prosecuted. Your sole duty is to decide whether\nthe People have proved the guilt of the defendant on trial.”\n       The instruction was intended to apply to defendant‟s cellmate, Gary Green,\nwho participated in the attack on Addis, but was not on trial. An internal rules\nviolation investigation by the Department of Corrections concluded that Green\nwas involved in the conspiracy to assault Addis and noted there was information\nthat Green had ordered the hit on Addis. Green was assessed a 360-day credit\nloss. However, 20 days after this disciplinary hearing, he was paroled. Based on\nthis record, defendant‟s gang expert, Steven Rigg, testified that Green was not\npunished for his participation in the conspiracy.\n       In light of this evidence, defense counsel requested a modification of\nCALJIC No. 2.11.5 to include the following language: “You may, however,\nconsider the actions taken against Mr. Green by members of the Department of\nCorrections to the extent same have been proved in this case as they bear upon\nissues of fact which you are asked to determine.” The prosecutor, while noting the\ndefense was free to argue its theory that correctional officers were complicit in the\nassault on Addis, objected to the modification of CALJIC No. 2.11.5 because it\n“takes away what this jury instruction is saying.” That is, it invited speculation as\nto why Green had not been prosecuted for the Addis murder. Defense counsel\nargued the modification “clarif[ied] the behavior of the Department of Corrections\ntoward Mr. Green, independent of any prosecutorial decisions that may be relevant\nto the facts in this case.” The trial court rejected the proposed modification.\n\n                                          58\n\f        There was no error. Defendant does not contend, nor could he, that\nCALJIC 2.11.5 was either inapplicable to this case or flawed as given. (See\nPeople v. Brown (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585503\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585503/people-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560 [purpose of the instruction “ „is to\ndiscourage the jury from irrelevant speculation about the prosecution‟s reasons for\nnot jointly prosecuting all those shown by the evidence to have participated in the\nperpetration of the charged offenses, and also to discourage speculation about the\neventual fates of unjoined perpetrators‟ ”].) The proposed modification would\nhave simultaneously instructed the jury it could not consider the prosecution‟s\nreasons for not prosecuting Green, but it could consider the actions of the\nDepartment of Corrections in giving him assertedly lenient punishment for his part\nin the attack on Addis. As the prosecutor here noted, this conflation of the actions\nof the District Attorney‟s Office and the Department of Corrections could only\nhave confused the jury and potentially eviscerated the instruction. Accordingly,\nthe trial court properly rejected the proposed modification.\n        Moreover, even without the proposed modification, nothing prevented the\ndefense from making its argument that the assertedly lenient treatment of Green by\nthe Department of Corrections was evidence of complicity by some correctional\nofficers in the attack on Addis. Therefore, his claims of error and prejudice both\nfail.\n\n        G. Cumulative Error\n        Because we have found no error in the guilt phase, there is no cumulative\nprejudice to address.\n\n\n\n\n                                         59\n\f                            III. PENALTY PHASE CLAIMS\n\n       A. Claims Related to Defendant’s Convictions for Assault by a Life\n          Prisoner with Malice Aforethought\n\n            1. Applicability of Section 4500 to Defendant at the Time of the\n                Offenses\n       Defendant contends his two convictions of assault by a life prisoner with\nmalice aforethought must be reversed because he was not “undergoing a life\nsentence” (§ 4500) at the time he assaulted Addis (count 2) and Matthews (count\n3). Citing section 1170.1, which addresses when a consecutive term imposed for a\nfelony committed in prison commences, defendant claims that at the time he\ncommitted the assaults, he was still serving a sentence for burglary, and his life\nsentence had not yet begun. He contends that his state and federal constitutional\nrights to due process, trial by jury, and a reliable penalty determination require\nreversal of his convictions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal.\nConst., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.)\n       Preliminarily, the People assert that defendant has forfeited this claim\nbecause he failed to make the argument below and, indeed, did not contest\nevidence presented by the prosecution in the form of prison records to prove he\nwas a life prisoner at the time of the offenses. Defendant casts his claim as one of\nsufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions, and on that basis, maintains\nthat such a claim may be raised for the first time on appeal. (See People v. Butler\n(2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2520965\"><a href=\"/opinion/2520965/people-v-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1126 [substantial evidence claim can be raised on appeal\neven if it was not argued at trial].) Assuming, without deciding, that the claim is\nproperly raised, it is without merit.\n       Section 4500 states in pertinent part: “Every person while undergoing a life\nsentence, who is sentenced to state prison within this state, and who, with malice\naforethought, commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon\n\n\n                                            60\n\for instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is\npunishable with death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole” if the\nvictim dies. (Italics added.) Section 1170.1, subdivision (c) (hereinafter section\n1170.1(c)) addresses when such a sentence commences if it is consecutive to a\nterm already being served. It provides that when “any person [is] convicted of one\nor more felonies committed while the person is confined in the state prison . . . and\nthe law either requires the terms to be served consecutively or the court imposes\nconsecutive terms, the term of imprisonment for all the convictions that the person\nis required to serve consecutively shall commence from the time the person would\notherwise have been released from prison.” (§ 1170.1(c), italics added.)\n        Here the evidence shows the following: In June 1992, defendant was\nsentenced to an eight-year prison term after he pleaded guilty to first degree\nburglary. The Department of Corrections calculated his earliest release date for\nthis offense would be February 10, 2000. In September 1995, while still serving\nhis burglary sentence, defendant pleaded guilty to possession of a deadly weapon\nby an inmate (§ 4502) which, because it was his third strike, resulted in a sentence\nof 25 years to life with the possibility of parole, consecutive to his burglary\nsentence. In defendant‟s chronological history log maintained by the Department\nof Corrections, an entry dated November 13, 1995, states: “Life term begins\n2/10/2000.” Defendant‟s assaults on Addis and Matthews were committed in\n1997.\n        Based on this record, defendant contends he was not “undergoing a life\nsentence” when he assaulted his fellow inmates in 1997; rather, he was still\nserving his burglary sentence. We rejected a similar argument in People v.\nMcNabb (1935) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1287639\"><a href=\"/opinion/1287639/people-v-mcnabb/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (McNabb), which involved section 4500‟s\npredecessor, former section 246. While McNabb was on parole for two robberies\nfor which he had been sentenced to two determinate sentences, he committed two\n\n                                          61\n\fmore robberies, for which he was sentenced to two terms of five years to life.\nUpon his conviction for these later robberies, his parole was revoked and he was\nrequired to serve the rest of the two determinate sentences. Thereafter, while\ntrying to escape from prison, he killed a fellow inmate. McNabb was tried and\nsentenced to death under former section 246, which provided: “ „Every person\nundergoing a life sentence in a state prison of this state, who, with malice\naforethought, commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon\nor instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, is\npunishable with death.‟ ” (McNabb, at p. 444.)\n       On appeal, McNabb contended that he was not serving a life sentence when\nhe attempted to escape because his life sentences for the later robberies, being\nconsecutive to the determinate sentences for the earlier robberies on which his\nparole had been revoked, had not yet commenced. We rejected his argument:\n“The fact that appellant McNabb was returned to prison upon two convictions of\nfirst degree robberies committed while released on parole and was required to\nserve out the uncompleted terms of imprisonment by reason of breaking the terms\nof his parole did not suspend the force of commitments upon which he was held.\nHad he been discharged or released from serving the uncompleted terms by a writ\nof habeas corpus or by pardon he would have still been held as a prisoner serving\na life term on said later commitments. We think the contention . . . to the effect\nthat a person is not undergoing a life sentence within the purpose and meaning of\nthe law, when imprisoned on a judgment which imposes the longest term known to\nthe law and to which nothing further may be added, because, forsooth, he is also\nheld on a prior uncompleted sentence for years does not stand the test of reason.”\n(McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d at p. 457.)\n       We dismissed the defendant‟s reliance on former section 669, which\nprovided that when a person was convicted of multiple crimes, the imprisonment\n\n                                         62\n\ffor each term was to “commence at the termination of the [preceding] term of\nimprisonment.” (Former § 669, as amended by Stats. 1927, ch. 626, § 1, p.\n1056.)13 “Section 669 . . . is not germane to the subject. It has to do with time\nserved in terms less than life. It does not purport to say that a person is not\nundergoing a life sentence when delivered on a certified copy of the judgment of\nconviction to the warden of the state prison. The prisoner is undergoing a life\nsentence whatever may happen and he is held as such a prisoner by virtue of said\njudgment.” (McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d at p. 457.)\n       Finally, we pointed out that former section 246 “was enacted as a\ndisciplinary regulation and as a means of protection to prisoners themselves\nagainst the assaults of the vicious, and also to protect the officers who are required\nto mingle with the inmates, unarmed. . . . It is applicable to the facts of\n[McNabb‟s] case in every sense.” (McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d at p. 458.)\n       In reliance on our decision in McNabb, the Court of Appeal in People v.\nSuperior Court (Bell) (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1334</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Bell), rejected a claim that a\ndefendant‟s attack on another inmate did not occur while he was “undergoing a\nlife sentence” (§ 4500) because he was serving a determinate term at the time of\nthe attack. The court noted that the phrase “undergoing a life sentence” has\nremained constant from the enactment of former section 246 through various\n\n13     In 1929, when McNabb was convicted of the two later robberies, former\nsection 669 provided: “When any person is convicted of two or more crimes the\nformer imprisonment to which he is sentenced upon the second or other\nsubsequent conviction must commence at the termination of the first term of\nimprisonment to which he shall be adjudged, or at the termination of the second or\nother subsequent term of imprisonment, as the case may be; provided, that in\nexceptional cases the judgment, in the discretion of the court, may direct that such\nterms of imprisonment, or any of them, shall run concurrently.” (Stats. 1927,\nch. 626, § 1, p. 1056.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          63\n\famendments to section 4500, and the Legislature‟s intent has also remained the\nsame — protecting guards and other prisoners from inmates who think they have\n“ „nothing left to lose‟ ” by committing crimes in prison. (Bell, supra, 99\nCal.App.4th at p. 1341; see id. at pp. 1340-1341, citing McNabb, supra, 1</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1287639\"><a href=\"/opinion/1287639/people-v-mcnabb/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Bell further observed that in In re Cowen (1946) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613083\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613083/in-re-cowen/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we\nexplained that former section 669, which required that judgments provide whether\nmultiple terms shall be served concurrently or consecutively, does “ „not . . .\nrequire that for all purposes, when consecutive sentences are directed, the\ndefendant shall be regarded as imprisoned on only one charge at a time.‟ ” (Bell,\nat p. 1343, quoting Cowen, at p. 648.) Bell acknowledged that former section 669\nwas amended after In re Cowen was decided, but concluded that “[a]ccording to\nthe plain language of section 669, the mandate that a determinate sentence be\nserved before a consecutive life sentence is for the purpose of calculating parole\neligibility, and not for the purpose of determining whether the prisoner is\nundergoing a life sentence within the meaning of section 4500.” (Bell, at p. 1343.)\n       Defendant attempts to distinguish McNabb and Bell on the basis that this\ncase is governed by section 1170.1(c), which specifically addresses consecutive\nsentences with respect to crimes committed while in prison, rather than section\n669, which more generally addresses concurrent and consecutive sentences. As\nnoted above, section 1170.1 provides that when an individual is convicted of\nfelonies in prison and consecutive sentences are imposed, “the term of\nimprisonment for all [such] convictions . . . shall commence from the time the\nperson would otherwise have been released from prison.” (§ 1170.1(c).) Based on\nthis language, defendant reasons that his life term under the Three Strikes law for\npossession of a weapon in prison would not have begun until the earliest date on\nwhich he could have been released with respect to his determinate term for the\n\n\n\n                                         64\n\fburglaries that led to his imprisonment. He contends that date would have been\nFebruary 10, 2000, more than two years after he assaulted Addis.\n       Defendant‟s argument is unpersuasive for at least two reasons. First, it\nignores the different language and functions of the two statutes. Section 1170.1(c)\naddresses when an inmate begins “to serve” consecutive sentences, whereas\nsection 4500 addresses the punishment to be imposed for specified assaults\ncommitted “while undergoing a life sentence.” Section 1170.1, like section 669, is\na technical sentencing statute that addresses the time during which an inmate is\nactually serving a particular prison term, and does not purport to have any bearing\non the question of whether an individual is undergoing a life sentence for purposes\nof section 4500. Furthermore, we presume that in enacting section 1170.1(c), the\nLegislature was aware of not only section 4500, but also the case law broadly\ninterpreting the phrase “undergoing a life sentence” in that statute. Had the\nLegislature intended for section 1170.1(c) to modify in any way the latter statute,\nit could have said so.\n       Second, defendant‟s argument would undermine the shared purpose of\nsections 1170.1(c) and 4500 — deterring inmates from committing crimes in\nprison. “Section 1170.1(c) applies to felonies committed when the defendant is\nconfined in a state prison. The statutory scheme makes clear that such felonies,\ni.e., those felonies committed in prison, are exempt from the general sentencing\nscheme.” (People v. White (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2137800\"><a href=\"/opinion/2137800/people-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 869.) The reason such\nfelonies are treated differently is that “[t]he Legislature wanted in-prison crimes to\nbe punished more severely than crimes committed „on the „outside.‟ ” (Ibid.) It\nwould be inconsistent with the legislative purpose of these statutes to construe\nsection 1170.1(c) to preclude the application of section 4500 to inmates who have\nnot yet begun serving an imposed and pending life sentence because they are still\nserving a determinate sentence.\n\n                                         65\n\f       Finally, defendant contends that because his Three Strikes conviction could\nhave been overturned on appeal before he began to serve it, he was not a person\nundergoing a life sentence when he assaulted Addis. Of course, any life sentence\nconsecutive to a determinate sentence could potentially be modified by\ncommutation, pardon, a statutory change, an ultimately successful appeal or\nhabeas corpus petition, or even avoided by the death of the inmate during the\ndeterminant term. Such speculative outcomes do not undermine the core\nreasoning of McNabb and Bell that the phrase “undergoing a life sentence” was\nintended to encompass an inmate who is subject to such a sentence, even if he or\nshe has not begun “serving” that sentence.\n\n           2. Whether Section 4500 Sufficiently Narrows the Class of Individuals\n              Eligible for the Death Penalty\n       Defendant contends that section 4500 fails to sufficiently narrow the class\nof individuals eligible for the death penalty in violation of his rights to a due\nprocess, and a fair trial, and the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.\n(U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const. art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15,\n16, 17.) We disagree.\n       Under section 4500, a person undergoing a life sentence is eligible for a\ndeath sentence if found guilty of an assault with a deadly weapon or with force\nlikely to produce great bodily injury, with malice aforethought, leading to the\ndeath of the victim. In effect, it authorizes imposition of the death penalty for\nwhat could be a second degree murder, i.e., an unlawful killing with malice\naforethought. In contrast, the vast majority of offenses eligible for the death\npenalty are various forms of first degree murder. (§ 190.2.) Nonetheless, as\ndiscussed below, the legislative determination that life prisoners who commit fatal\naggravated assaults are potentially deserving of death is a venerable one; versions\nof this statute have existed for more than a century. (See former § 246, added by\n\n\n                                          66\n\fStats. 1901, ch. 12, § 1, p. 6.) Moreover, the statute is based on rationales\ninvolving security and deterrence in prison settings (see McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d\nat p. 457; Bell, supra, 99 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1339-1340), and California is scarcely\nalone in recognizing that killings committed by life prisoners in prison constitute a\nspecial class of homicide as to which the severest penalty should potentially apply.\n       Section 4500 is a death eligibility statute as opposed to a death selection\nstatute. (See Tuilaepa v. California (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117875\"><a href=\"/opinion/117875/tuilaepa-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 971-972.) A defendant\nconvicted of the offense defined by section 4500 becomes eligible for the death\npenalty or its alternative, life without the possibility of parole. Thereafter, the jury\nselects the penalty following a penalty phase trial at which it considers evidence in\naggravation and mitigation under section 190.3. The selection process requires an\n“ „individualized determination‟ ” of the appropriate penalty based on “ „the\ncharacter of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.‟ ” (Tuilaepa, at p.\n972.) This “requirement is met when the jury can consider relevant mitigating\nevidence of the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the\ncrime.” (Ibid.) The requirement of an individualized determination does not,\nhowever, apply to the eligibility stage. (Id. at p. 973.)\n       The distinction between the eligibility and selection phases is significant in\nterms of the “differing constitutional treatment [the United States Supreme Court\nhas] accorded those two aspects of capital sentencing. It is in regard to the\neligibility phase that [the court has] stressed the need for channeling and limiting\nthe jury‟s discretion to ensure that the death penalty is a proportionate punishment\nand therefore not arbitrary or capricious in its imposition. In contrast, in the\nselection phase, [the court has] emphasized the need for a broad inquiry into all\nrelevant mitigating evidence to allow an individualized determination.”\n(Buchanan v. Angelone (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118164\"><a href=\"/opinion/118164/buchanan-v-angelone/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275-276.)\n\n\n\n                                          67\n\f       “To pass constitutional muster, a capital sentencing scheme [1] must\n„genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and [2] must\nreasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant\ncompared to others found guilty of murder.‟ ” (Lowenfield v. Phelps (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111978\"><a href=\"/opinion/111978/lowenfield-v-phelps/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244.) With respect to the first requirement, we note that the class of\nindividuals potentially subject to the death penalty under section 4500 is quite\ncircumscribed: persons serving a life sentence who, with malice aforethought,\nassault another with a deadly weapon or instrument, or by any means of force\nlikely to produce great bodily injury, resulting in the death of the victim within a\nyear and a day. (See Woodson v. North Carolina (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109535\"><a href=\"/opinion/109535/woodson-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 287, fn. 7\n[describing as “an extremely narrow category of homicide” “murder [committed]\nby a prisoner serving a life sentence”].) The statute easily satisfies the\nrequirement that an eligibility factor “apply only to a subclass of defendants\nconvicted of [homicide].” (Tuilaepa v. California, supra, 512 U.S. at p. 972.)\n       With respect to the second requirement — reasonable justification for a\nmore severe sentence — we reiterate that the Legislature has determined that death\neligibility for life prisoners who commit an aggravated assault that leads to the\nvictim‟s death is required to “protect[] [their fellow] prisoners . . . against the\nassaults of the vicious, and also to protect the officers who are required to mingle\nwith the inmates, unarmed.” (McNabb, supra, 3 Cal.2d at p. 458; accord, Bell,\nsupra, 99 Cal.App.4th at p. 1341.) By imposing more severe penalties on those\nserving life sentences, “the Legislature was attempting to deter severely violent\ncrime by those who might otherwise think themselves immune from punishment\nbecause they were already lifetime guests of the state penal system.” (In re\nCarmichael (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546.) Along with retribution, deterring\nattacks by life prisoners and thereby promoting the safety of inmates and\ncorrection officers are legitimate penal objectives. (See Kennedy v. Louisiana\n\n                                           68\n\f(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145780\"><a href=\"/opinion/145780/kennedy-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420 (Kennedy) [“punishment is justified under one or more\nof three principal rationales: rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution”].) These\nrationales of institutional security, deterrence, and retribution provide a reasonable\njustification for distinguishing this category of murder from others to which the\ndeath penalty does not apply.\n       Defendant contends section 4500 fails to sufficiently narrow the subclass of\ndefendants eligible for the death penalty because it does not distinguish between\ndifferent types of life prisoners, such as those serving a life term for murder and\nsomeone like him whose life sentence was imposed under the Three Strikes law\nfor nonviolent felonies.14 There is no requirement at the eligibility stage that a\nnarrowly circumscribed class of defendants for whom the death penalty is\nreasonably justified be further distinguished according to the particular\ncircumstances that led to their eligibility. Rather, that is a question that goes to the\nselection stage and its individualized determination requirement. Only at that\npoint does the Eighth Amendment require “a broad inquiry into all relevant\nmitigating evidence to allow an individualized determination.” (Buchanan v.\nAngelone, supra, 522 U.S. at p. 276.) Although the reason why a defendant was a\nlife prisoner at the time of the violation of section 4500 may be a relevant\nconsideration for the jury at the selection stage, that reason is irrelevant to the\njustification for including such persons in the death-eligible class; the reasons\nunderlying section 4500 apply with equal force to life prisoners who have\n\n\n\n\n14      Defendant‟s life sentence was imposed as a result of his 1995 guilty plea to\na third strike of possession of a weapon in prison (§ 4502) and his admission to\ntwo prior felony convictions for burglary.\n\n\n\n\n                                           69\n\fcommitted prior violent crimes and those who face lifetime imprisonment for\nnonviolent offenses.15\n       Defendant next argues that “[d]evelopments since [prior] decisions\nupholding [earlier versions of] section 4500 and its predecessor statutes have\nundermined the retribution, deterrence and safety rationales offered to justify\ndeath eligibility on life prisoner status.” In essence, defendant‟s claim is that,\nbecause prior versions of section 4500 would not pass constitutional muster in\nlight of evolving Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, the underlying legislative\njustifications for punishing life prisoners who, with malice aforethought, commit\nfatal assaults in prison have also been eroded over time. As explained below, the\nargument fails because the legislative justifications remain valid.\n       Until 1977, section 4500 and its predecessor, former section 246, mandated\nthe death penalty for life prisoners who committed an aggravated assault,\nregardless of whether the victim died. The original statute, enacted in 1901,\nprovided: “Every person undergoing a life sentence in a state prison of this state,\nwho, with malice aforethought, commits an assault upon the person of another\nwith a deadly weapon or instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce\ngreat bodily injury, is punishable with death.” (Stats. 1901, ch. 12, § 1, p. 6.) In\n\n\n15      Defendant‟s reliance on Tuilaepa v.California, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117875\"><a href=\"/opinion/117875/tuilaepa-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, is\nmisplaced. As he concedes, Tuilaepa concerns death selection, not death\neligibility. Moreover, Tuilaepa‟s observation that some sentencing factors may be\nunconstitutionally vague if they lack “some „common-sense core of meaning . . .\nthat criminal juries should be capable of understanding‟ ” (id. at p. 975) does not\nsupport defendant‟s assertion that section 4500 is unconstitutionally vague. As\nTuilaepa itself notes, “[t]he eligibility decision fits the crime within a defined\nclassification.” (Id. at p. 973.) Section 4500 meets this standard. Similarly,\nGodfrey v. Georgia (1980) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110259\"><a href=\"/opinion/110259/godfrey-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, also cited by defendant, involved a\nvagueness challenge to a sentencing factor. (Id. at pp. 422-423.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f1941, section 246 was repealed and reenacted, renumbered as section 4500, but\ntextually remained substantially the same. (Stats. 1941, ch. 106, §§ 1, 15, pp.\n1080, 1124.) In 1977, following the restoration of the death penalty in California\n(see People v. Frierson (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1434797\"><a href=\"/opinion/1434797/people-v-frierson/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172-175), section 4500 was\namended to its present form. The amendment eliminated the mandatory death\npenalty provision and limited eligibility for the death penalty to aggravated\nassaults with malice aforethought resulting in death, with the alternative of life\nwithout the possibility of parole. (Stats. 1977, ch. 316, § 21, p. 1264.)\n       Defendant cites a number of decisions by this court upholding those earlier\nand now superseded versions of the statute against various constitutional\nchallenges (see, e.g., People v.

From this\n\n                                         71\n\fpremise, he contends that the legislative justifications offered in support of the\nstatute in our earlier opinions — deterrence, retribution, and institutional security\n— have been eroded and are now constitutionally suspect.\n       Defendant‟s logic is flawed and the cases on which he relies are inapposite.\nDecisions rejecting constitutional challenges to prior versions of the statute\ncontaining elements that would no longer be constitutionally permissible are\nobviously not controlling in our examination of the current version of the statute.\nNonetheless, the discussions in those earlier decisions of the threats of violence\nposed by prisoners sentenced to life terms as justification for the policy of\npotentially imposing the death penalty on them remain valid and support the\ncurrent version of section 4500.16 The United States Supreme Court continues to\nrecognize that penal statutes may legitimately rest on one or more of “three\nprincipal rationales: rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution” (Kennedy, supra,\n554 U.S. at p. 420.) Section 4500, as already noted, singles out a particular\nsubclass of defendants who commit lethal assaults with malice aforethought —\nthose imprisoned for life — and makes them eligible for the death penalty because\nthe Legislature has determined their particular status as life prisoners requires this\nexceptional measure to protect correctional officers and other inmates. With the\n\n16      For example, in People v. Finley, supra, 153 Cal. at page 61, this court\nobserved that “it has long been a part of judicial knowledge, of legislative\nknowledge, and, indeed, of general knowledge, that convicts in penal institutions\nundergoing sentences for life, constitute a most reckless and dangerous class. The\nconditions of their sentences destroy their hopes and with the destruction of hope\nall bonds of restraint are broken and there follows a recklessness leading to brutal\ncrimes. . . . They were crimes of violence committed not alone against fellow\ninmates, but upon the custodians, officers, and guards of the institutions. . . .\nUnder this well-recognized condition of affairs it seemed expedient to the\nlegislature to meet the situation by the enactment of section 246 of the Penal\nCode.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          72\n\fgrowth in the prison population and prison gangs, this rationale applies with equal\nor greater force today compared to when it was first articulated over a hundred\nyears ago. Accordingly, we reject defendant‟s assertion that the statute‟s rationale\nhas been superseded or undermined merely because earlier versions of the statute\nwould no longer pass constitutional muster.\n       The opinion upon which defendant places primary reliance, Sumner v.\nShuman (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111934\"><a href=\"/opinion/111934/sumner-v-shuman/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, is inapposite. In Sumner, the United States Supreme\nCourt declared unconstitutional a Nevada statute that mandated the death penalty\nfor prisoners who committed murder while undergoing a sentence of life without\nthe possibility of parole. Under Nevada law, life without the possibility of parole\ncould be imposed for crimes other than murder, such as kidnapping, rape and\nbattery with substantial bodily harm. (Id. at pp. 80-81.) The Supreme Court noted\nthat under those circumstances, “[w]ithout consideration of the nature of the\npredicate life-term offense and the circumstances surrounding the commission of\nthat offense, the label „life-term inmate‟ reveals little about the inmate‟s record or\ncharacter.” (Id. at p. 81.) The court further noted that “a guided-discretion\nsentencing procedure does not undermine any deterrent effect that the threat of the\ndeath penalty may have” (id. at p. 83), and that a guided-discretion procedure does\nnot necessarily allow an inmate to avoid retribution (id. at pp. 83-84). The court\ndid not, however, question the legitimacy of deterrence and retribution as\nrationales. In short, the statute in Sumner differs from section 4500 in crucial\nrespects, and defendant‟s reliance on Sumner is misplaced.\n       Defendant also cites two studies assertedly demonstrating that the death\npenalty has an insignificant deterrent effect on prison murders.17 The weight and\n\n17    Defendant cites Sorensen & Pilgrim, An Actuarial Risk Assessment of\nViolence Posed by Capital Murder Defendants (2000) 90 J. Crim. L. &\n                                                            (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                          73\n\fvalidity of such studies involve policy questions within the Legislature‟s purview.\nSo, too, do defendant‟s arguments regarding retributive steps short of death that\nmight be taken against prisoners who kill. These studies do not establish that\nimposing death eligibility on life prisoners who commit fatal aggravated assaults\nis constitutionally impermissible.\n        Next, defendant contends that an “interjurisdictional comparison\ndemonstrates a lack of societal consensus that a murder by a life prisoner”\ndeserves the death penalty. We are not persuaded.\n        In evaluating whether there was a consensus against making the crime of\nrape of a child punishable by death, the United States Supreme Court examined\nboth “[t]he history of the death penalty for the crime of rape” and the current\nstatus of such statutes in the United States. (Kennedy, supra, 554 U.S. at p. 422.)\nThe court traced an historical movement away from imposing the death penalty for\nrape from its high point in 1925 when 18 states, the District of Columbia and the\nfederal government had such statutes, to the post-Furman (Furman v. Georgia\n(1972) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">) landscape, when only Louisiana and five other states had\nreenacted such statutes. The court further noted that the statutes of four of those\nstates were more restrictive than Louisiana‟s law, because they required a prior\nconviction for rape as a condition for death eligibility while the remaining state,\nGeorgia, required aggravating circumstances including, but not limited to, a prior\nconviction. (Kennedy, supra, 554 U.S. at p. 423.) “By contrast, 44 States have\nnot made child rape a capital offense. As for federal law, Congress in the Federal\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\nCriminology 1251, and Marquart & Sorensen, A National Study of the Furman-\nCommuted Inmates: Assessing the Threat to Society from Capital Offenders\n(1989) 23 Loyola L.A.

[Citation.] Under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2245, an offender is death eligible only when the sexual abuse or exploitation\nresults in the victim‟s death.” (Ibid.)\n       The court drew comparisons between these statistics and those it had\nexamined in three earlier cases in which it had held the death penalty\nunconstitutional when imposed upon certain types of aiders and abettors to felony\nmurder (Enmund v. Florida (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110795\"><a href=\"/opinion/110795/enmund-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">), the intellectually disabled\n(Atkins v.

(Kennedy, supra, 554 U.S. at pp. 425-426.) As in those cases, the\ncourt‟s survey led it to conclude that the “evidence of a national consensus with\nrespect to the death penalty for child rapists . . . shows divided opinion but, on\nbalance, an opinion against it.” (Id. at p. 426.) The court concluded: “After\nreviewing the authorities informed by contemporary norms, including the history\nof the death penalty for this and other nonhomicide crimes, current state statutes\nand new enactments, and the number of executions since 1964, we conclude there\nis a national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape.”\n(Id. at p. 434.)\n       As an initial matter, it is significant that the court in Kennedy explicitly and\nrepeatedly referred to the fact that the statute at issue authorized the death penalty\nfor a crime that, while still devastating for the victim, did not result in the victim‟s\ndeath. (See, e.g., Kennedy, supra, 554 U.S. at p. 435 [acknowledging that “there\nare moral grounds to question a rule barring capital punishment for a crime against\nan individual that did not result in death”]; id. at p. 437 [“the death penalty should\nnot be expanded to instances where the victim‟s life was not taken”]; id. at p. 439\n[recognizing the possibility of arbitrary results in cases of heinous crimes that may\n\n                                           75\n\f“overwhelm a decent person‟s judgment” and refusing to “sanction this result\nwhen the harm to the victim, though grave, cannot be quantified in the same way\nas death of the victim”].) Of course, for a violation of section 4500 to be death\neligible, the victim must die (within a year and a day) from the assault.\nAccordingly, a major aspect of the court‟s reasoning in Kennedy does not apply\nhere.\n        Defendant nonetheless contends that there is no “societal consensus” to\nsupport imposition of death for a life prisoner who kills. In support of his claim,\nhe cites the high court‟s decisions in Kennedy, Roper, Atkins, and Enmund, but his\nanalysis bears only a superficial resemblance to those opinions‟ rigorous\nexamination of historical, judicial, and legislative trends regarding the existence of\nan evolving national consensus against authorization of imposition of the death\npenalty on a class of defendants. Instead, he rests his argument solely on his\nassertion that 75 percent of American jurisdictions have rejected using prisoner\nstatus to determine death eligibility. His statistical reading is tendentious. In fact,\nbased on his statistics, it is more accurate to say that the vast majority of\njurisdictions with the death penalty regard custody status as a significant factor in\neither death penalty eligibility or death penalty selection, or for both purposes. Of\nthe 31 states and the federal government whose laws currently authorize\nimposition of the death penalty, the laws of 29 states and the federal government\nuse custody status as a death-eligibility or a death-selection factor, or both. It\nappears that only Nebraska and South Carolina do not explicitly include custodial\nstatus as a death-eligibility or selection factor.\n        Defendant does not cite, nor has our research found, a single judicial\ndecision from any death penalty jurisdiction that has held that the use of custodial\nstatus as either an eligibility or a selection factor for the death penalty violates the\nEighth Amendment. Nor has defendant shown that any jurisdiction that reenacted\n\n                                           76\n\fthe death penalty following Furman v. Georgia, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, omitted\ncustodial status as either an eligibility or selection factor for purposes of the death\npenalty. Thus, defendant fails to demonstrate the existence of an historical\ntrajectory supporting a conclusion that the majority, or, indeed, any, of the death\npenalty jurisdictions has abandoned custody status as a factor for imposing the\ndeath penalty.\n       Instead, defendant attempts to parse the statistical evidence to argue that we\nshould look only at states whose statutes mirror section 4500, that is, statutes that\nuse life term status as an eligibility factor and apply the death penalty to killings\nthat do not rise to the level of first degree murder. Using this metric, defendant\nconcludes that only eight states have a law comparable to section 4500.\n       However, the question here is whether custodial status is used by a majority\nof jurisdictions as a basis for potentially imposing the death penalty, not how\nindividual jurisdictions use that factor. In other words, is there a consensus that\nthe death penalty is not an appropriate punishment for a fatal aggravated assault by\na life prisoner? Moreover, in this case, where defendant was also convicted of\nfirst degree murder, he would have faced the death penalty in every jurisdiction\nthat uses custodial status as either an eligibility or selection factor. Even granting\nthat only a few states have statutes mirroring section 4500, this number is\nmeaningless without a rigorous analysis of the type undertaken by the United\nStates Supreme Court, which examines not simply numbers, but statutory history\nand relevant judicial and legislative actions, to answer the national consensus\nquestion. Defendant provides none of that, and as mentioned, we have uncovered\nnothing that suggests a majority of the country rejects the death penalty in\ncircumstances covered by section 4500.\n       Finally, defendant asserts the status of life prisoner is overbroad because it\ndoes not further distinguish between those inmates whose life sentence was the\n\n                                          77\n\fresult of a violent crime and those, like himself, whose life sentence is premised\non a Third Strike as to which the predicate crimes were nonviolent felonies.\n        As noted earlier, however prisoners subject to life sentences came to hold\nthat status, they are a small and distinct subclass of those who commit homicides\npunishable as murder. Additionally, the rationale for making such defendants\ndeath eligible — to deter and punish crimes by individuals acting under the belief\nthey have nothing left to lose — applies to all life prisoners regardless of the\nreason for their life sentences. Furthermore, to the extent the reasons for a\ndefendant‟s life sentence might mitigate his or her punishment, that is an issue that\ncan be raised at the penalty phase.\n        For these reasons, we reject defendant‟s constitutional challenge to section\n4500‟s death eligibility provision.\n\n        B. Prosecutorial Discretion in Seeking Death Penalty\n        Defendant contends that prosecutorial discretion in seeking the death\npenalty violates his federal and state constitutional rights to due process and equal\nprotection, and constitutes “the arbitrary and capricious enforcement of the death\npenalty.” (U.S. Const., 5th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, § 7, subd,\n(a).)\n        We have consistently held that “prosecutorial discretion to select those\neligible cases in which the death penalty actually will be sought does not, in and of\nitself, evidence an arbitrary and capricious capital punishment system, nor does\nsuch discretion transgress the principles underlying due process of law, equal\nprotection of the laws, or the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.”\n(People v. Crittenden (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2614001\"><a href=\"/opinion/2614001/people-v-crittenden/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152.) As we explained in an early\ndecision addressing the issue: “Many circumstances may affect the litigation of a\ncase chargeable under the death penalty law. These include factual nuances,\n\n\n\n                                          78\n\fstrength of evidence, and, in particular, the broad discretion to show leniency.\nHence, one sentenced to death under a properly channeled death penalty scheme\ncannot prove a constitutional violation by showing that other persons whose\ncrimes were superficially similar did not receive the death penalty. [Citations.]\nThe same reasoning applies to the prosecutor‟s decisions to pursue or withhold\ncapital charges at the outset.” (People v. Keenan (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405837\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405837/people-v-keenan/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506.) In\nsubsequent cases, we rejected the argument that we should reexamine this holding\nin light of the high court‟s voting rights decision in Bush v.

We continue to adhere\nto that holding. (See, e.g., People v.

Nothing in defendant‟s arguments persuades us that our\nearlier rulings were incorrect. Furthermore, the reasoning of those cases applies\nwith equal force to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to seek the death\npenalty under section 4500.\n\n       C. Admission of Evidence of Defendant’s Criminal History\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed the\nprosecutor to elicit from a defense expert on cross-examination details of\ndefendant‟s theft-related prior offenses and juvenile adjudications. He contends\nthe ruling also violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process, a\nfair trial, trial by jury, and a reliable penalty determination. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th,\n8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a). 15, 16, 17.) The claim is\nmeritless.\n\n             1. Background\n       James Cuevas testified for the defense in his capacity as a casework\nspecialist for the California Youth Authority (CYA), now known as the California\n\n\n\n                                           79\n\fDivision of Juvenile Justice, a position he likened to that of a social worker.\nCuevas described his function as providing “diagnostic evaluations for the court”\nand the CYA. Although not a psychologist, his academic credentials included\ncourses in psychology and “some basic understanding of various mental health\nissues.” His formal degree was a masters in social work.\n       In 1987, defendant, then 19 years old, pleaded guilty to two counts of\nburglary and one count of grand theft auto. Although an adult, the court referred\ndefendant to the CYA in lieu of state prison under a statute that allowed the\ntransfer of individuals under 21 to the CYA. Cuevas led the team that assessed\ndefendant to determine “a treatment plan and also potential placement for his\nbenefit.” This assessment was memorialized in a 97-page document labeled\nDaniel Landry Mental Health Records. On direct examination, Cuevas reviewed\nthe report and testified generally to its observations and conclusions regarding\ndefendant‟s mental health and treatment plan. For example, he testified about\ndefendant‟s troubled family life, including the fact that his parents were both deaf\nand had emotional problems. He also stated that defendant reported he had been\nsexually molested on two occasions. He reviewed defendant‟s placements as a\njuvenile in institutions for juveniles with emotional problems, and he reported that\ndefendant told him he had escaped from juvenile hall. Cuevas recounted that\ndefendant seemed depressed and suicidal, and that he had recommended that\ndefendant receive intensive individual therapy as well as group therapy and be\nenrolled in educational and vocational programs.\n       Over defendant‟s objection, and following an Evidence Code section 402\nhearing, the trial court allowed the prosecutor to cross-examine Cuevas about the\ndetails of the three offenses for which defendant was referred to the CYA, as well\nas prior juvenile theft-related adjudications. At the evidentiary hearing, Cuevas\nstated that defendant‟s criminal history was “[e]xtremely important” to his\n\n                                         80\n\fassessment of defendant and his recommendations as to treatment and placement.\nIn addition, in response to a question from the court, he explained that the specific\ndetails of a prior offense were relevant to a treatment plan “because we may send\nhim to a placement program . . . that will deal with individuals with that particular\nproblem. . . . So we look at the pattern of behavior.”\n       On cross-examination, Cuevas again stated that a person‟s criminal history\nwas very important to his assessment and recommendations because it factored\ninto the decision about placement and treatment. He explained that defendant‟s\nhistory of “thievery” demonstrated he was “a chronic, habitual offender,” for\nwhom earlier attempts at intervention had failed. He testified that, as a juvenile,\ndefendant had been provided with various opportunities for rehabilitation after\njuvenile petitions charging theft-related offenses had been sustained against him.\nCuevas explained that defendant‟s prior criminal history and prior placements\nwere relevant to his future placement because it “sort of, you know, curtails the\ntype of . . . trust we can . . . provide for him . . . within the facility.” The\nprosecutor then led Cuevas through defendant‟s current and prior convictions and\njuvenile adjudications in detail. This testimony addressed sustained juvenile\npetitions for burglary when defendant was 15 years old and when he was 16 years\nold, as well as details of his then-current offenses. Based on that history, Cuevas\nconcluded that defendant was a “chronic habitual offender.” In light of this,\nCuevas had recommended that defendant be placed in a “closed, locked setting” at\nwhich he would “be supervised every minute of his life.”\n\n            2. Discussion\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed the\nprosecutor to cross-examine Cuevas about the details of defendant‟s prior theft-\nrelated convictions and juvenile adjudications, because they did not involve the\n\n\n\n                                            81\n\fuse or attempted use or threat of violence and were thus inadmissible as a factor in\naggravation under section 190.3, factor (b). He contends further that the testimony\nwas irrelevant because the details of defendant‟s criminal history were “not\nimportant to [Cuevas‟s] clinical impressions and his long-range custodial plans.”18\n       Regarding defendant‟s first argument, the evidence of his theft-related\ncriminal history was not presented by the prosecution pursuant to section 190.3,\nfactor (b) but was, instead, proper rebuttal to the defense case in mitigation.\n“Rebuttal evidence is relevant and admissible if it tends to disprove a fact of\nconsequence on which the defendant has introduced evidence. . . . The trial court\nhas broad discretion to determine the admissibility of rebuttal evidence and, absent\npalpable abuse, an appellate court may not disturb the trial court‟s exercise of that\ndiscretion.” (People v.

The defense called\nCuevas to further its overall depiction of defendant as the victim of a grossly\nabusive family who, as a result, suffered from severe emotional and psychological\nproblems that mitigated his current offense. The defense sought to do so by\nselectively questioning Cuevas about his evaluation of defendant, focusing on his\nchaotic family background and depressed mental state. The prosecution was\nentitled to rebut this characterization that defendant was a victim by demonstrating\nthat Cuevas‟s assessment also included his view that defendant was a habitual\nchronic offender who had failed in previous attempts at rehabilitation.19 Thus, the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the prosecution to question\nCuevas about defendant‟s prior criminal record in order “to present a more\nbalanced picture of the defendant‟s personality.” (People v. Valdez, supra, 55\nCal.4th at p. 170.)\n\n\n\n19     Defendant quotes a sentence from In re Lucas (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548479\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548479/in-re-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in\nwhich we said, “Evidence that a defendant suffered abuse in childhood generally\ndoes not open the door to evidence of defendant‟s prior crimes or other\nmisconduct.” (Id. at p. 733.) In Lucas, we granted the defendant‟s petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus based on his claim that his trial attorney was constitutionally\nineffective for failing to investigate or present mitigating evidence of abuse he\nsuffered as a child. The sentence defendant quotes was in connection with our\ndiscussion regarding prejudice and our comment that the respondent had not\noffered any theory under which evidence of the abuse defendant suffered as a\nchild would, in and of itself, have opened the door to rebuttal evidence. (Ibid.)\nThat observation has no bearing on the present case, which is distinguishable both\nlegally and factually.\n\n\n\n\n                                          83\n\f       D. Admission of Razor Blade Evidence\n       Defendant contends the admission of evidence that he was in possession of\na razor blade discovered in his cell during the penalty phase trial was an abuse of\ndiscretion and violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process, a\nfair trial, trial by jury, and reliable capital sentencing proceedings. (U.S. Const.,\n5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.) The\ncontention is meritless.\n       In a search of defendant‟s cell during the penalty phrase trial, a razor blade\nwas discovered on a table. Defendant was not permitted to possess razor blades.\nThe prosecution sought to present evidence of this incident under section 190.3,\nfactor (b), which allows evidence of criminal activity which “[i]nvolved the use or\nattempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or\nviolence.” The prosecution argued that defendant‟s possession of the razor blade\nviolated section 4502, subdivision (a), which prohibits possession, custody or\ncontrol of a weapon, including “any dirk or dagger or sharp instrument” by a\nperson confined in any penal institution. Over the defense‟s objection, the trial\ncourt admitted the evidence.\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion because there was\nno evidence he intended to use the razor blade to attack anyone and, therefore, his\npossession did not constitute the use or attempted use of or express or implied\nthreat to use violence. We previously rejected this argument in People v. Wallace\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in which the defendant similarly argued that simple\npossession of a razor blade, without evidence that he had threatened to use it, is\nnot admissible under section 190.3, factor (b). “As we have previously explained,\n„mere possession of a potentially dangerous weapon in custody involves an\nimplied threat of violence . . . .‟ [Citation.] The circumstances of defendant‟s\npossession of the contraband, particularly when viewed together with his overall\n\n\n                                          84\n\fconduct while in custody — which included five rules violations for fighting —\nlead us to conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\nevidence of defendant‟s razor possession under section 190.3, factor (b).”\n(Wallace, at p. 1082.)\n       As noted above, in this case, the prosecution introduced evidence that\ndefendant had, on numerous occasions, possessed prison-made slashing\ninstruments and had used them to attack fellow inmates. At least one of these\nweapons had been fashioned out of a razor blade. The trial court clearly did not\nact outside the bounds of reason in concluding defendant‟s possession of the razor\nblade discovered in his cell during the penalty phase trial could constitute evidence\nof a threat of violence. In these circumstances, the court acted well within its\ndiscretion when it admitted the razor blade evidence under section 190.3,\nfactor (b).\n\n       E. Admission of Criminal Activity Beyond the Statute of Limitations\n       Defendant contends the admission of 18 prior criminal incidents under\nsection 190.3, factor (b) was barred by the statute of limitations. As he concedes,\nhowever, we have repeatedly rejected this argument. “ „[N]either remoteness nor\nthe expiration of the statutory limitations period bars admission of a defendant‟s\nprior unadjudicated criminal activity for purposes of section 190.3, factor (b).‟ ”\n(People v. Famalaro (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42, quoting People v.

Defendant‟s arguments do not persuade us that reconsideration\nof these decisions is warranted.\n\n       F. Claims of Instructional Error\n\n              1. Instruction on Defenses to Criminal Activity and Defendant’s\n                  Mental Health Evidence\n       Defendant contends the trial court‟s failure to instruct the jury, on the\ncourt‟s own motion, to consider certain defenses to certain unadjudicated criminal\n\n                                          85\n\factivity introduced by the prosecution under section 190.3, factor (b), after the\ncourt granted the prosecution‟s request to instruct on the elements of those\noffenses, violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process, a fair\ntrial, trial by jury, and reliable capital sentencing proceedings. (U.S. Const., 5th,\n6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art I, §§ 7, subd. (a), 15, 16, 17.)\nSpecifically, he contends the trial court should have instructed the jury that self-\ndefense against the use of excessive force was a defense to an incident on October\n21, 1994, during which defendant was forcibly extracted from his cell after\nrefusing to return his food tray. Furthermore, he contends the trial court should\nhave instructed the jury to consider the impact of his mental health issues on all\nfactor (b) evidence. The claim is meritless.\n       Over the defense‟s objection, the trial court agreed to instruct the jury on\nthe elements of the section 190.3, factor (b) offenses. The defense did not request\nany further instruction on these offenses and none was given.\n       Preliminarily, the People contend defendant has forfeited this claim because\nhe assertedly had a tactical reason for not requesting additional instruction — he\nwanted to minimize the jury‟s focus on his criminal activity. “When defense\ncounsel makes a „ “conscious, deliberate tactical choice” ‟ to request [or object to]\nan instruction, any error in the giving [or refusal to give] the instruction is invited\nand cannot be raised on appeal.” (People v. Catlin (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621193\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621193/people-v-catlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150.)\nHowever, defendant‟s objection was only to the prosecutor‟s request to instruct the\njury on the elements of the offenses. This limited objection does not bar\ndefendant‟s present claim, which relates to the trial court‟s further duty, once it\nagreed to give the elements instruction, to “instruct sua sponte on legally available\ndefenses.” (People v. Montiel (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1113193\"><a href=\"/opinion/1113193/people-v-montiel/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 942.)\n       In prior decisions, we have assumed without deciding that when the trial\ncourt gives an instruction on the elements of section 190.3, factor (b) offenses,\n\n                                           86\n\fthose instructions should include any applicable defenses. (People v. Montiel,\nsupra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 942; see, also, People v. Cain (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1163416\"><a href=\"/opinion/1163416/people-v-cain/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72.)\nNonetheless, the court is under no obligation to provide such instruction unless\n“such defenses are supported by substantial evidence.” (People v. Montiel, at\np. 942.) “Substantial evidence is evidence sufficient to „deserve consideration by\nthe jury,‟ that is, evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive.” (People\nv.

Defendant fails to identify such\nevidence. He does no more than repeat his version of the circumstances under\nwhich correctional officers were forced to remove him from his cell after he\nrefused to return his food tray and refused to come out peaceably. Thus, no self-\ndefense instruction was warranted.\n       With respect to his claim that the trial court should have instructed the jury\nto consider evidence of his mental health problems as they bore on the section\n190.3, factor (b) evidence, defendant fails to demonstrate how such evidence\nwould have comprised a legal defense to any of those offenses. Rather, he\ncontends that such evidence was a potentially mitigating factor and the jury should\nhave been so instructed. Such instruction was given in the form of an instruction\npatterned on section 190.3, factor (k). The jury was told it could consider in\nmitigation “any sympathetic or any aspect of the defendant‟s character or record\nthat the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not\nrelated to the offense for which he is on trial.” Furthermore, in discussing the\nfactor (b) evidence, defense counsel specifically argued that the evidence of\ndefendant‟s mental health issues and the failure of correctional authorities to\nrespond to his request for treatment “remarkabl[y] diminished the weight of\n[factor (b)] material.” Accordingly, the jury was instructed it could consider this\nevidence, and defense counsel explicitly urged them to do so.\n\n\n\n                                         87\n\f       Defendant asserts, however, that the section 190.3, factor (k) instruction\nwas insufficient to direct the jury to the particular issue of the effect of his mental\nillness as it related to the section 190.3, factor (b) evidence. That claim is forfeited\nby his failure to seek clarification or amplification of the instruction.

CALJIC No. 8.87\n       Defendant contends CALJIC No. 8.87, which addresses evidence related to\nsection 190.3, factor (b), is flawed because (1) it creates a mandatory presumption\nof violence and (2) it fails to require that jurors unanimously agree that defendant\ncommitted the factor (b) criminal activity.20 We have previously rejected these\nchallenges to the instruction. (People v. Butler, supra, 46 Cal.4th at pp. 871-872\n[CALJIC No. 8.87 does not create a mandatory presumption]; People v. Zambrano\n(2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2517801\"><a href=\"/opinion/2517801/people-v-zambrano/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1181-1182 [unanimity not required].) Nothing in\ndefendant‟s argument persuades us to revisit these conclusions.\n\n20      In pertinent part, the jury was instructed as follows: “Evidence has been\nintroduced for the purpose of showing that the defendant has committed the\nfollowing criminal acts or activities . . . all of which involved the express or\nimplied use of force or violence or the threat of force or violence. Before a juror\nmay consider any criminal activity as an aggravating circumstance in this case, a\njuror must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant . . . did in fact\ncommit the criminal activity. A juror may not consider any evidence of any other\ncriminal activity as an aggravating circumstance. [¶] It is not necessary for all\njurors to agree. If any juror is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the\ncriminal activity occurred, that juror may consider that activity as a fact in\naggravation. If not so convinced, that juror must not consider that evidence for\nany purpose.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          88\n\f           3. Instruction Regarding Punishment of Accomplice\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury to\nconsider as a mitigating circumstance the punishment meted out to his accomplice,\nGary Green. As defendant acknowledges, we have repeatedly rejected the claim\nthat a court should instruct the jury that it may consider lenient treatment of an\naccomplice as a mitigating circumstance. “ „We have consistently held that\nevidence of an accomplice‟s sentence is irrelevant at the penalty phase because “it\ndoes not shed any light on the circumstances of the offense or the defendant‟s\ncharacter, background, history or mental condition.” ‟ ” (People v. Brown, supra,\n31 Cal.4th at p. 562; accord, People v.

(People v. Cain, supra,\n10 Cal.4th at p. 63 [“Parker did not hold evidence of an accomplice‟s sentence\nmust be introduced in mitigation at the penalty phase, or that a comparison\nbetween sentences given codefendants is required”].) We adhere to these\nconclusions.\n\n           4. Use of Restrictive Adjectives and Restrictive Timeframe in\n               Instructions on Mitigating Factors\n       Defendant contends the use of certain restrictive adjectives in CALJIC\nNo. 8.85 pertaining to mitigating factors, such as “extreme” and “substantial,”\nimpose an unconstitutional threshold requirement before the jury may consider\nmitigating evidence. We have repeatedly rejected this argument (People v. Cage\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 296), and do so again. We have also consistently rejected\ndefendant‟s related claim that language in section 190.3, factors (d) and (h)\nallowing consideration of defendant‟s mental or emotional state or intoxication at\nthe time of the offense precludes the jury from considering such evidence when it\n\n\n\n\n                                          89\n\fis not related to the offense (People v.

CALJIC No. 8.88\n       Defendant makes familiar and oft-rejected challenges to CALJIC No. 8.88,\nwhich advises jurors regarding the scope of their discretion to reject death and\nreturn a verdict of life without the possibility of parole. We again conclude that\nthe instruction is “not unconstitutional for failing to inform the jury that: (a) death\nmust be the appropriate penalty, not just a warranted penalty [citation]; (b) [a\nsentence of life without the possibility of parole] is required, if it finds that the\nmitigating circumstances outweigh those in aggravation [citation] or that the\naggravating circumstances do not outweigh those in mitigation [citation]; (c) [a\nsentence of life without the possibility of parole] may be imposed even if the\naggravating circumstances outweigh those in mitigation [citation]; (d) neither\nparty bears the burden of persuasion on the penalty determination [citation]. [¶]\n[Moreover,] section 190.3 and the pattern instructions are not constitutionally\ndefective for failing to assign the state the burden of proving beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that an aggravating factor exists, that the aggravating factors outweigh the\nmitigating factors, and that death is the appropriate penalty. . . . The recent\ndecisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the Sixth Amendment‟s\njury trial guarantee do not compel a different result.” (People v. Bramit (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2573928\"><a href=\"/opinion/2573928/people-v-bramit/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1249-1250, fn. omitted.) Finally, the use of the phrase “ „ “so\nsubstantial” ‟ ” as a standard of comparison for mitigating and aggravating factors\ndoes not render the instruction unconstitutional. (People v. Dykes (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625630\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625630/people-v-dykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 814.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           90\n\f       G. Constitutional Challenges to Death Penalty Statute\n       Defendant raises a number of challenges to the constitutionality of the\ndeath penalty statute, which, as he acknowledges, we have previously and\nconsistently rejected. His arguments fail to persuade us to reconsider our prior\ndecisions and, therefore, we again reject the contentions that the statute is\nunconstitutional because it (1) fails to require the jury to find the existence of\naggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt (People v. Cage, supra, 62 Cal.4th\nat p. 296); (2) does not require written findings of factors in aggravation (ibid.);\n(3) does not require that the jury be instructed that mitigating factors can be\nconsidered solely for mitigation (ibid.); (4) does not require intercase\nproportionality review (People v. Charles (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337); and (5)\nprovides certain procedural safeguards to noncapital defendants that are not\navailable to capital defendants (ibid.).\n\n       H. Denial of Automatic Motion to Modify Death Verdict\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred when it denied his automatic\nmotion to modify the death verdict (§ 190.4, subd. (e)) because it gave no weight\nto the mitigating evidence of duress, and it erroneously found that evidence of his\nmental health problems was not mitigating. He asserts the error violated his\nfederal and state constitutional rights to due process and a reliable penalty\ndetermination, and the prohibition against arbitrary and capricious imposition of\nthe death penalty. (U.S. Const., 5th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art I, §§ 7,\nsubd. (a), 15, 17.) Defendant failed to object to the trial court‟s ruling and his\nclaim is therefore forfeited. (People v. Carasi, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1316.) It is\nalso meritless.\n       “Every death verdict triggers an automatic application for modification of\nthe sentence. [Citation.] The trial court is obligated to review the evidence,\nindependently reweigh any aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and\n\n\n                                           91\n\fdetermine whether the weight of the evidence supports the verdict. [Citations.] In\nruling on the application, the trial court must set forth reasons on the record and\ndirect that they be entered in the clerk‟s minutes. [Citation.] On appeal, we\nreview the trial court‟s ruling independently, but it is not our role to redetermine\nthe penalty in the first instance.” (People v. Gamache, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p.\n403.) “Where the record shows the trial court properly performed its duty under\nsection 190.4, subdivision (e), to conduct an independent reweighing of the\naggravating and mitigating evidence, the court‟s ruling will be upheld.” (People v.\nCunningham (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669.)\n       Here, the trial court‟s written statement of reasons for denying the motion\ndemonstrates it was aware of its obligation to independently consider all the\nevidence. The court noted, however, that it was not the court‟s intention to “list\nevery item of evidence . . . , but rather to recite the principal factors, which most\npowerfully inform and influence the decision at hand.” This was proper; the court\nwas not required to “recount „every detail‟ supporting its determination.” (People\nv. Lewis and Oliver (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599880\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599880/people-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1064.)\n       The trial court considered both aggravating and mitigating evidence. With\nrespect to the factors in aggravation, the court found that the murder was willful,\ndeliberate, and premeditated, with express malice aforethought, and was gang\nrelated. The court also listed, in some detail, defendant‟s long and violent history\nof other criminal activity while incarcerated. The court found there was no\nevidence to show defendant committed the murder under the influence of extreme\nmental or emotional disturbance or that he acted under extreme duress or the\nsubstantial domination of another. With respect to factors that might extenuate the\ngravity of the crime (§ 190.3, factor (k)), the court noted defendant‟s traumatic\nchildhood, physical, mental and sexual abuse, his diagnosis of bipolar disorder,\nand the failure of prison authorities to consistently provide him with medication.\n\n                                          92\n\fNonetheless, the court concluded: “While it is easy to feel great sympathy for the\ndefendant as a child, and it appears clear that the defendant should have received\nbetter mental health supervision in prison, it also appears that these factors had\nlittle to do with his decision to kill.”\n       Although defendant frames his claim as a failure of the trial court to\nconsider his mitigating evidence, his claim, in essence, is that the trial court failed\nto give sufficient weight to evidence of duress and his mental health issues. His\ncontention does not reflect a valid appellate challenge to the trial court‟s decision.\n(See People v. Abilez (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599854\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599854/people-v-abilez/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 [The fact that the trial court “did\nnot find defendant‟s proffered mitigating evidence as persuasive as he would have\nliked does not undermine” the conclusion that the court properly conducted an\nindependent reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating evidence].)\nAccordingly, even were the claim not forfeited by defendant‟s failure to object, we\nwould affirm the trial court‟s ruling.\n\n       I. International Law\n       Contrary to defendant‟s assertion, “California‟s death penalty law does not\nviolate international law and norms or evolving standards of decency.” (People v.\nCage, supra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 297.)\n\n       J. Disproportionality of the Death Sentence\n       Defendant contends his death sentence is unconstitutionally\ndisproportionate to the offense and the offender. “[W]hen a defendant requests\nintracase proportionality review, . . . we review the particular facts of the case to\ndetermine whether the death sentence is so disproportionate to the defendant‟s\npersonal culpability as to violate the California Constitution‟s prohibition against\ncruel or unusual punishment.” (People v. Wallace, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1099.)\n\n\n\n\n                                           93\n\f       “ „To determine whether a sentence is cruel or unusual as applied to a\nparticular defendant, a reviewing court must examine the circumstances of the\noffense, including its motive, the extent of the defendant‟s involvement in the\ncrime, the manner in which the crime was committed, and the consequences of the\ndefendant‟s acts. The court must also consider the personal characteristics of the\ndefendant, including age, prior criminality, and mental capabilities. [Citation.]‟\n[Citation.] „If the court concludes that the penalty imposed is “grossly\ndisproportionate to the defendant‟s individual culpability” [citation], or, stated\nanother way, that the punishment “ „ “shocks the conscience and offends\nfundamental notions of human dignity” ‟ ” [citation], the court must invalidate the\nsentence as unconstitutional.‟ ” (People v. Virgil (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1287.)\n       Defendant‟s disproportionality argument emphasizes evidence that (1) he\nwas manipulated and ordered to kill Addis, (2) prison authorities failed to provide\nconsistent treatment for his bipolar disorder, and (3) he suffered a traumatic\nchildhood. The only evidence he cites to support his claim of manipulation is\nexpert testimony that he was easily manipulated; there is no evidence he was\nmanipulated in this case. With respect to his claim that he was ordered to kill\nAddis, the fact that another gang member may have been the shot-caller does not\nmitigate defendant‟s culpability in this case. After defendant savagely attacked\nAddis, defendant lay giggling and laughing on the ground. In a subsequent letter,\ndefendant wrote that the killing “kinda put me at ease, had to earn it,” and that\ncommitting the murder would elevate his status with higher ranking gang\nmembers. Based on this evidence, it appears he was a hit man for the gang rather\nthan a pawn. In support of his theory of manipulation and duress, defendant\nasserts that prison officials knew Addis would be assaulted if he came into the\nyard, and he observes that he was not the person who demanded that Addis be\n\n\n\n                                          94\n\fbrought out, but he does not explain how these facts would diminish his role in the\nmurder.\n       With respect to treatment for defendant‟s bipolar disorder, although it is\ntrue there was evidence prison officials did not consistently provide defendant\nwith certain psychotropic medications, it is also true, as the People point out, that\nthere was evidence both that defendant denied he had any mental health issues and\nsometimes refused such medications. Thus, defendant‟s assertion that his criminal\nactivity in prison merely “resulted from the denial of treatment for long-standing\nmental health issues” is not persuasive.\n       Finally, with respect to defendant‟s traumatic childhood, although his\nchildhood was characterized by abuse and neglect, there was also considerable\nfamily support offered to him by his grandparents.\n       The evidence reflects that defendant, a member of a prison gang, with a\nlong history of violence while incarcerated, committed a vicious, unwarranted,\nsurprise attack on an unarmed fellow inmate, causing his victim to bleed to death.\nConsidered together with defendant‟s personal circumstances, we cannot conclude\nthat the imposition of the death penalty shocks the conscience or offends\nfundamental notions of human dignity.\n       Defendant also invokes sections 1181, subdivision 7, and 1260 as authority\nfor this court to reduce his sentence from death to life imprisonment without the\npossibility of parole.21 “But under those sections, „we lack the power to overturn\n\n21     Section 1181, subdivision 7, states that a court may grant a new trial motion\n“[w]hen the verdict or finding is contrary to law or evidence, but in any case\nwherein authority is vested by statute in the trial court or jury to recommend or\ndetermine as a part of its verdict or finding the punishment to be imposed, the\ncourt may modify such verdict or finding by imposing the lesser punishment\nwithout granting or ordering a new trial, and this power shall extend to any court\nto which the case may be appealed.”\n                                                           (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                           95\n\fa judgment of death simply because we disagree with the jury‟s penalty\ndetermination‟ [citation], and we may only reverse the judgment if we find\n„prejudicial error or legal insufficiency of evidence [citation].‟ ” (People v.\nLeonard (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632907/people-v-leonard/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1427.) We find neither of those circumstances.\n\n        K. Asserted Cumulative Error\n        Defendant contends the cumulative weight of asserted errors occurring at\nhis trial requires reversal. We have not affirmatively concluded that any errors\noccurred, and in those instances in which we have assumed an error, have\nconcluded any error was harmless. Even when considered cumulatively, the\nassumed errors could not have deprived defendant of a fundamentally fair trial.\n                          IV. NONCAPITAL SENTENCING CLAIM\n        Defendant contends the trial court erroneously imposed a one-year sentence\nenhancement for use of a deadly weapon (former § 12022, subd. (b)(1)\n(hereinafter section 12022(b)(1)) on count 3, the assault on Joseph Matthews\n(§ 4500) because use of a deadly weapon was an element of defendant‟s offense.\nWe agree.22\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\n       Section 1260 provides that “[t]he court may reverse, affirm, or modify a\njudgment or order appealed from, or reduce the degree of the offense or attempted\noffense or the punishment imposed, and may set aside, affirm, or modify any or all\nof the proceedings subsequent to, or dependent upon, such judgment or order, and\nmay, if proper, order a new trial and may, if proper, remand the cause to the trial\ncourt for such further proceedings as may be just under the circumstances.”\n22     Defendant did not object to the imposition of the enhancement at trial, but\nargues that the trial court‟s action constituted an unauthorized sentence that is\nsubject to correction at any time without objection. (See People v. Cunningham\n(2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2587254\"><a href=\"/opinion/2587254/people-v-cunningham/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1044.) On that basis, we review the claim.\n\n\n\n                                          96\n\f       At the time of trial, section 12022(b)(1) stated: “Any person who\npersonally uses a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission or attempted\ncommission of a felony shall, upon conviction of that felony or attempted felony,\nin addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or\nattempted felony of which he or she has been convicted, be punished by an\nadditional term of one year, unless use of a deadly or dangerous weapon is an\nelement of the offense of which he or she was convicted.” (Italics added.) As a\ngeneral rule, “[t]he phrase „element of the offense‟ signifies an essential\ncomponent of the legal definition of the crime, considered in the abstract.”\n(People v. Hansen (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317, italics omitted, overruled on another\nground in People v.

In Hansen, the\ndefendant was convicted of second degree felony murder, based on the underlying\nfelony of discharging a firearm into an inhabited dwelling. We concluded the\nfirearm use enhancement could be imposed on the defendant‟s conviction, because\nthe crime of second degree murder, “considered in the abstract, does not include\nuse of a firearm as an element. Second degree murder may be committed in a\nmyriad of ways, some that involve use of a firearm, and others, such as stabbing,\npoisoning or strangling, that do not involve use of this type of weapon. Under\n[former] section 12022.5, subdivision (a), the enhancement applies unless „use of a\nfirearm is an element of the offense,‟ and not merely the means by which the\noffense was committed or the factual predicate of a theory upon which the\nconviction was based.” (Hansen, at p. 317.)\n       Defendant acknowledges Hansen, but contends the facts of this case come\nwithin the reasoning of People v. McGee (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2289895\"><a href=\"/opinion/2289895/people-v-mcgee/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

[1]\nwith a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm or [2] by any means of\n\n                                          97\n\fforce likely to produce great bodily injury . . . .‟ ” (McGee, at p. 112, fn. 2) The\ntrial court imposed an enhancement under section 12022(b)(1) for use of a deadly\nweapon, which the Court of Appeal struck.\n       The appellate court in McGee acknowledged that the phrase “ „element of\nthe offense‟ ” in the enhancement statute means “ „an essential component of the\nlegal definition of the crime considered in the abstract.‟ ” (McGee, supra, 15\nCal.App.4th at p. 114, italics omitted.) It also observed that section 245(a)(1)\nspecified two forms of prohibited conduct, assault with a deadly weapon other\nthan a firearm and assault by means of force likely to produce great injury.\nTherefore, section 245(a)(1) could be violated without using a deadly weapon.\n(Ibid.) The court further observed, however, that the statute “ „defines only one\noffense, to wit “assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or\ninstrument [other than a firearm] or by any means of force likely to produce great\nbodily injury . . . .” The offense of assault by means of force likely to produce\ngreat bodily injury is not an offense separate from . . . the offense of assault with a\ndeadly weapon.‟ [Citation.] Consequently, in determining whether use of a\ndeadly weapon other than a firearm is an element of a section 245, subdivision\n(a)(1) conviction, the question is not simply whether, in the abstract, the section\ncan be violated without using such a weapon. Rather, the conduct of the accused,\ni.e., the means by which he or she violated the statute, must be considered.”\n(McGee, supra, 15 Cal.App.4th at pp. 114-115.)\n       Applying these observations to the facts before it, the court in McGee\nconcluded: “Here, defendant‟s use of a deadly weapon other than a firearm was\nthe sole means by which he violated section 245, subdivision (a)(1). The assault\nby means of force likely to produce great bodily injury was defendant‟s stabbing\nof the victim with a knife. Hence, his use of the weapon was an element of the\noffense, within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b), even though the\n\n                                          98\n\fcrime was pleaded as an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily\ninjury rather than as an assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm.”\n(McGee, supra, 15 Cal.App.4th at p. 115.) The court also noted that the\nprosecutor had pleaded the offense as an assault by means of force likely to\nproduce great bodily injury rather than an assault with a deadly weapon to “evade\nthe statute‟s exception and to increase the punishment imposed on defendant.”\n(Id. at p. 116.) If prosecutors were allowed to “divide section 245, subdivision\n(a)(1) into two separate offenses regardless of the defendant‟s conduct, . . .\nsimilarly situated defendants who assaulted their victims with deadly weapons\nother than firearms and were charged with violating section 245, subdivision (a)(1)\ncould receive disparate punishment depending solely upon the language used in\nthe pleadings. . . . This is an absurd and unjust result which is inconsistent with\nthe legislative intent in enacting sections 245, subdivision (a)(1) and 12022,\nsubdivision (b).” (Id. at p. 117.)\n       Section 4500 is similar to the version of section 245 considered in McGee,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in that section 4500 refers to a person “who, with\nmalice aforethought, commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly\nweapon or instrument, or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily\ninjury.” (Italics added.) Thus, as was true of former section 245, subdivision\n(a)(1), section 4500 defines a single offense that can be committed in one of two\nways, by use of a deadly weapon or instrument or by any means of force likely to\nproduce great bodily injury. Whether in a particular case, the use of a deadly\nweapon or instrument was an element of the offense cannot be answered in the\nabstract; “the conduct of the accused, i.e., the means by which he or she violated\nthe statute, must be considered.” (McGee, supra, 15 Cal.App.4th at p. 115.)\n       In this case, not only did the evidence show defendant used a razor to cut a\ngash in Matthews‟s back, but with respect to count 3, the jury was specifically\n\n                                          99\n\finstructed: “In order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be\nproved: (1) A person was assaulted; [¶] (2) The assault was committed with a\ndeadly weapon or instrument . . . .” Thus, in the particular circumstances of this\ncase, the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon was an element of defendant‟s\noffense under section 4500, barring imposition of the use enhancement set forth in\nsection 12022 (b)(1).\n       The People‟s attempts to distinguish McGee are unpersuasive. The People\ncontend that McGee contradicts the public policy of punishing more severely those\nwith a greater degree of culpability. The case they cite for this proposition, People\nv. Murray (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2286199\"><a href=\"/opinion/2286199/people-v-murray/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, involved consecutive sentencing for mixed\nfelony and misdemeanor convictions and not the enhancement at issue here; its\npublic policy observation arises in that specific, and distinguishable, context. (Id.\nat pp. 1787-1788.) Moreover, the public policy considerations that underlie\nsection 12022(b) were discussed at length in McGee, which examined the\nLegislature‟s intent in enacting the enhancement. McGee concluded that where\n“ „the Legislature has fixed the punishment for an assault where a deadly weapon\nis used, . . . it is not to be supposed that for the same offense without any\nadditional factor existing the added punishment should be imposed.‟ ” (McGee,\nsupra, 15 Cal.App.4th at p. 116, quoting In re Shull (1944) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1146115\"><a href=\"/opinion/1146115/in-re-shull/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 751.)\nThis observation applies with equal force to section 4500.\n       The People also argue that McGee has been limited to the specific facts of\nthat case, citing a footnote in People v. Ross (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2270388\"><a href=\"/opinion/2270388/people-v-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Ross,\nthe trial court stayed imposition of a firearm use enhancement (former § 12022.5,\nsubd. (b)), where defendant had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter by\nshooting the victim. The trial court reasoned that the use of the firearm was\nidentical to the “ „crime itself‟ ” and thus section 654 precluded defendant from\nbeing punished twice for the same act. (Ross, at p. 1155.) The Court of Appeal\n\n                                         100\n\freversed because firearm use was not an element of voluntary manslaughter. In\nthis connection, it distinguished McGee, noting that the statute at issue there,\nassault with a deadly weapon (§ 245(a)(1)), “had two alternative forms, as to one\nof which weapons use was an element,” and for that reason “has no application to\nthis case.” (Ross, at p. 1156, fn. 7.) As noted above, section 4500 is analogous to\nsection 245(a)(1), and, therefore, McGee’s reasoning is equally applicable.\n       Accordingly, we strike the enhancement for use of a dangerous or deadly\nweapon from count 3.\n                                  V. CONCLUSION\n       The enhancement for use of a dangerous or deadly weapon is stricken from\ncount 3, and the judgment is otherwise affirmed.\n\n\n                                                        CANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.
