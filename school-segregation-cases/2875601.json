We reverse.\n\n\n     Brandt, a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW)\nLocal 88 labor union, worked as a \"casual\" meat wrapper out of the union\nhall from 1987 to July 1991.1         That is, she worked for Shop 'n Save and\nother grocery stores on an \"as needed,\" temporary\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The 1993 UFCW Local 88 collective bargaining agreement with\nShop 'n Save now calls the meat wrapper position \"meat clerk,\" and\nhas broadened the job description to include all duties previously\nassigned the \"meat cutter\" position, except operating a band saw.\n\fbasis.2    The Shop 'n Save employees who knew Brandt and worked with her,\nwithout exception, praised her work.       In August 1990, Brandt sent a letter\nto Richard Marty, then acting senior vice president of human resources for\nShop 'n Save, and a similar letter to Harold \"Butch\" Covili, Shop 'n Save's\nsenior vice president of operations, expressing interest in joining Shop\n'n Save as a permanent employee, in a position as, in her words, a \"female\napprentice meat cutter,\" or in front-end management or co-management.               As\na courtesy, Marty interviewed Brandt on September 7, 1990, and told her\nthen and in a follow-up letter dated ten days later that Shop 'n Save did\nnot have a position to offer her.          Marty's letter said Brandt's resume\nwould be retained in Shop 'n Save's \"active files\" for one year.                Brandt\ntestified that, in the same time frame, she also told Danny Howard, who was\none of three \"meat specialists\" each assigned to supervise meat operations\nat approximately one-third of Shop n' Save's twenty-eight stores, of her\ninterest in an apprentice meat cutter position with Shop 'n Save.                As of\ntrial, Shop 'n Save had only one female meat cutter, who had been hired by\nthe company when it acquired a Kroger store where she was employed.                The\nevidence also shows that, of the 600-650 meat cutters on Local 88's\nmembership roster at that time, only three or four were female.\n\n\n       In May 1991, Marty hired John Dougherty to fill the position of\nsenior vice president of human resources, the position Marty himself had\nbeen holding temporarily, and Marty returned to his position with Shop 'n\nSave's parent corporation.    At this time, Covili also was no longer working\nin Shop 'n Save's St. Louis office.         So Marty and Covili were out of the\npicture as far as the day-to-day operations of Shop 'n Save's St. Louis\narea   stores   were   concerned,   but    Howard,   who   also   knew   of   Brandt's\nambitions, was still working for the company as a meat specialist.              During\nthe\n\n\n\n\n       2\n     In July 1991, Brandt was hired by Shop 'n Save as a permanent\nemployee, working as a meat wrapper (now meat clerk).\n\n                                          -2-\n\fmonth of May, after Dougherty was hired, the events leading up to Brandt's\nlawsuit transpired, although the record does not establish a precise\nsequence.\n\n\n     Sometime during the month, after Dougherty assumed his duties, he\nreceived a call from Bob Frentzel, an old friend he had known since 1966.\nFrentzel had experienced some employment setbacks since 1988, and in fact\nhad been unemployed for five months before he called Dougherty.     He sought\nwhatever employment assistance Dougherty could offer.           Also in May,\nDougherty, together with Bill Fant, Shop 'n Save's meat manager, who had\noverall responsibility for the meat departments in all area stores, decided\nto hire an apprentice meat cutter, someone with management experience and\n\"some college,\" but not necessarily any meat experience.       The apprentice\nmeat cutter job description in the UFCW Local 88 contract with Shop 'n Save\nin effect at that time did not say that the apprentice position was a\nmanagement position, nor did the job description give any indication that\nany college education would be preferred, much less required, of the\nsuccessful meat cutter apprentice.   Dougherty and Fant's ostensible goal,\nhowever, was to move the person who was hired for the job into management\nafter the two-year meat cutter apprenticeship was completed.     This was the\nfirst time (and the last, as it turns out) that Shop 'n Save created an\napprentice meat cutter position, although the union contract allowed one\nsuch position in each store if Local 88 gave its permission, as it did in\nthis case.\n\n\n     In hiring a person to fill this new job, Dougherty and Fant never\nsearched the \"active files\" for potential candidates who might have applied\nfor employment with Shop 'n Save before the apprentice position was\ncreated.    The job was never posted or otherwise advertised.    Frentzel was\nthe only person interviewed or even considered to fill the position.\nDougherty, Fant, and Howard (who reported to Fant) all participated in the\nhiring of Frentzel.   Frentzel had management experience, although not for\nseveral years;\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fhe had \"some college,\" although serious doubt was cast upon both just how\nmuch \"some\" is and the extent to which the decision-makers were genuinely\ninterested in that aspect of Frentzel's background; and he had virtually\nno meat experience.       Brandt had neither management experience nor \"some\ncollege,\" but she did have extensive meat experience.             By June 3, 1991, Bob\nFrentzel was on the job in the apprentice position, at the Shop 'n Save\nstore where Brandt happened to be working as a meat wrapper out of the\nunion hall.    As of the date of trial on Brandt's claims, three and one-half\nyears after he was hired and one and one-half years after he completed the\napprentice    program,    Frentzel    had    not   been    promoted    to   a   management\nposition, despite the fact that Shop 'n Save had filled several openings\nfor such positions with other individuals.\n\n\n     The     same   day   Frentzel   went    to    work   for   Shop   'n   Save,   Brandt\nconfronted Dougherty and told him she had previously submitted a resume and\nhad expressed an interest in a position as an apprentice meat cutter.                  She\ntold Dougherty she believed his failure to consider her for the apprentice\njob was sex discrimination.          Two weeks later, Brandt filed a charge of\nemployment discrimination against Shop 'n Save with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission and the Missouri Commission on Human Rights.                 Brandt\nfiled suit against Shop 'n Save in May 1992, alleging sex discrimination\nand retaliation in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17,\nand the comparable Missouri employment discrimination law, Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§§ 213.010-.126.      Trial was held before a jury and, by consent of the\nparties and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), before a magistrate judge.                 The\njury found for Shop 'n Save on Brandt's claim of retaliation, but for\nBrandt on her claim of sex discrimination.                The jury further determined\nthat Shop 'n Save's conduct in this matter was such that punitive damages\nwere warranted.     In addition, in derogation of the court's instructions,\nthe jury specified not only an amount of punitive damages (which was\nsupposed to be determined in a later proceeding and for which the jury had\nno evidence), but also that Shop 'n Save\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fshould pay Brandt's attorney fees.   After disposing of post-trial motions,\nthe Magistrate Judge entered judgment on the jury's verdict, awarding\nBrandt equitable relief and $22,500 in compensatory damages.     The court\nalso awarded Brandt $35,000 in punitive damages and $39,852.25 in attorney\nfees and costs.   Judgment was entered in favor of Shop 'n Save on Brandt's\nclaim of retaliation.   Shop 'n Save appeals.\n\n\n     For its first issue on appeal, Shop 'n Save contends that the court\nerred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law (JAML).     We\nreview de novo, \"applying the same standard as the district court and\noverturning the verdict only if the evidence, viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party, is insufficient to support the verdict.\"\nKarcher v. Emerson Elec. Co., 94 F.3d 502, 507 (8th Cir. 1996), petition\nfor cert. filed, 65 U.S.L.W. 3587 (Feb. 5, 1997) (No. 96-1304).    We have\nrecited the facts in this opinion mindful of that standard, but we have\nomitted those facts relating to Brandt's retaliation claim, the adverse\njudgment on which Brandt does not appeal.\n\n\n     Shop 'n Save makes a two-part argument on its JAML issue.   First, the\ncompany claims that Brandt failed to prove a prima facie case of sex\ndiscrimination under McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802\n(1973), and its progeny.3     In the event we disagree and conclude that\nBrandt proved her prima facie case, Shop 'n Save alternatively argues that\nBrandt did not sustain her ultimate burden of proof under St. Mary's Honor\nCenter v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511 (1993).   That is, Shop 'n Save contends\nit answered Brandt's prima facie case with legitimate reasons for its\nactions, and that she was unable to show those reasons were a\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973),\nsets out the analysis to be applied to cases where the proof of\nalleged discrimination is circumstantial. Brandt makes no claim\nthat there is direct evidence Shop 'n Save discriminated against\nher, so the McDonnell Douglas framework is appropriate here.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fpretext for intentional discrimination.        Because we conclude as a matter\nof law that Brandt did not prove that her gender was a motivating factor\nin Shop 'n Save's decision to hire Frentzel instead of her, we do not\nconsider the challenged aspects of the prima facie case.               We assume for\npurposes of this appeal that Brandt proved a prima facie case of sex\ndiscrimination by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\n      Once the employee offers sufficient evidence to establish a prima\nfacie case of unlawful discrimination, it becomes the employer's burden to\nproduce evidence that it had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its\nactions.   Hicks, 509 U.S. at 507.       If it does so, the \"presumption [of\ndiscrimination] raised by the prima facie case is rebutted.\"            Id. (quoting\nTexas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255 (1981))\n(alteration added by this Court).     The burden of persuasion--\"the ultimate\nburden\"--then moves to the employee to prove that the employment action in\nquestion was taken at least in part because of her sex.          Id.    In this phase\nof the case, the employee ordinarily attempts to prove that the employer's\narticulated reasons are pretextual, thus raising the inference that sex was\na motivating factor for the adverse employment action.                 But it is not\nenough that the employee submit evidence of pretext such that the jury\ndisbelieves the defendant's \"legitimate\" reasons.           See O'Bryan v. KTIV\nTelevision, 64 F.3d 1188, 1192 (8th Cir. 1995) (\"[A] plaintiff's proof of\npretext, with respect to the defendant's proffered reason for its actions,\nis relevant to, but not dispositive of, the ultimate issue of intentional\ndiscrimination.\") (emphasis added).     \"That the employer's proffered reason\nis   unpersuasive,   or   even   obviously   contrived,   does    not    necessarily\nestablish that the plaintiff's proffered reason of [sex] is correct.            That\nremains a question for the factfinder to answer, subject, of course, to\nappellate review--which should be conducted . . . under the ‘clearly\nerroneous’ standard . . . .\"      Hicks, 509 U.S. at 524.    We conclude, after\nde novo review and giving Brandt the benefit of all reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\finferences that might be drawn from the evidence, that the jury's finding\nof unlawful discrimination cannot be sustained as there is insufficient\nevidence to support it, and that Shop 'n Save was entitled to judgment as\na matter of law on Brandt's claims of sex discrimination.\n\n\n        Shop 'n Save contends that it proffered a legitimate reason for\nhiring Frentzel instead of Brandt.      According to the company, Brandt was\nnot qualified to fill the apprentice position as it was conceived by\nDougherty and Fant, because she had neither management experience nor \"some\ncollege.\"    We have carefully reviewed the record in this case, and we are\nconfident that the jury easily might have found that Shop 'n Save--\nDougherty specifically, with Fant's assistance--created the apprentice meat\ncutter position and its qualifications with the express purpose of hiring\nFrentzel to fill it, that is, that Shop n' Save's proffered \"legitimate\nreason\" was a fabrication, a pretext for its true reasons.                We are so\npersuaded    ourselves.    But   notwithstanding     Shop   'n   Save's    arguable\ndissembling about its reasons for hiring Frentzel, we do not believe that\nBrandt has met her burden of proving that the pretext was intended to\nconceal unlawful discrimination or that her gender in any way motivated the\nhiring of Frentzel instead of Brandt.        The \"fact sensitive\" issue at this\nstage of the analysis is \"whether the employee has provided evidence from\nwhich    a   reasonable   factfinder   could     conclude   that   the     employer\nintentionally discriminated against the employee for a prohibited reason.\"\nRothmeier v. Investment Advisers, Inc., 85 F.3d 1328, 1334 (8th Cir. 1996).\nWe hold that she has not.\n\n\n        The evidence shows that Frentzel took advantage of his \"network\" to\nland the apprentice meat cutter position, and that Dougherty obliged his\nfriend by supporting his application for the position, if not creating a\ntailor-made position for Frentzel.       We do not condone the exclusion of\nBrandt as a viable candidate on this basis.       But it is not intentional sex\ndiscrimination for\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fDougherty to hire an unemployed old friend who happens to be male, without\nconsidering an applicant who is neither unemployed nor an old friend and\nhappens to be female.        An employer's business decision concerning hiring\nneed   not   be   a   good    decision   to    withstand    a     challenge   for   sex\ndiscrimination; it is enough that it not be motivated by the gender of the\nemployee who is adversely affected by the decision.             The proof at trial was\nthat Shop 'n Save had hired no males or females to be apprentice meat\ncutters before Frentzel, and has hired none since.          It is apparent that the\nposition was created for Frentzel, with the job's \"qualifications\" tailored\nto Frentzel's background, rather than that Frentzel coincidentally and\nfortuitously happened into a just-created position that required his\n\"qualifications.\"      The fact that Frentzel has yet to be promoted to a\nmanagement position lends credence to that inference.               But such actions,\nalthough unfair from the standpoint of Brandt and persons of either gender\nwho are similarly situated, are not a violation of state and federal laws\nprohibiting sex discrimination in employment.              See Hutson v. McDonnell\nDouglas Corp., 63 F.3d 771, 781 (8th Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he employment-\ndiscrimination laws have not vested in the federal courts the authority to\nsit as super-personnel departments reviewing the wisdom or fairness of the\nbusiness judgments made by employers, except to the extent that those\njudgments involve intentional discrimination.\").                The evidence suggests\nthat at no time during the proceedings did Shop 'n Save fully acknowledge\nthe reasons Frentzel was selected to fill the apprentice meat cutter\nposition, and the jury evidently found the company's prevarication not at\nall to its liking.    Nevertheless, no reasonable jury could have found that\nFrentzel was hired to the exclusion of Brandt because Brandt is female.\nSee Gathright v. St. Louis Teacher's Credit Union, 97 F.3d 266, 268 (8th\nCir. 1996) (stating that denial of motion for JAML should be affirmed \"if\na reasonable jury could differ as to the conclusions that could be drawn\").\nShop 'n Save thus is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f        Nothing in our recent en banc decision in Ryther v. KARE 11, No. 94-\n3622 (8th Cir. Mar. 6, 1997), requires a contrary conclusion.                      This is a\ncase “where the evidence of pretext is inconsistent with an inference of\nintentional discrimination.”          Id., slip op. at 7 n.2.            Of course, Brandt\nwas   free   to   “rely    on   the   same    evidence    to     prove   both   pretext    and\ndiscrimination,” but that does not prevent our reversal of the denial of\nShop ‘n Save’s motion for JAML where “the evidence is insufficient for a\nreasonable trier of fact to infer unlawful discrimination.”                  Id. at 35 n.13\n(Loken, J., in a partial separate concurrence commanding a majority of the\nCourt en banc.)\n\n\n        Shop 'n Save raises a number of other issues in its appeal.                    Because\nof our disposition of the first issue, it is unnecessary for us to consider\nthose that remain.\n\n\n        The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is\nremanded with instructions for the court to enter judgment for Shop 'n\nSave.\n\n\nHEANEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n\n        I   respectfully     dissent.         The    majority     concedes      that   Brandt\nestablished a prima facie case of sex discrimination and that she presented\nsufficient evidence for a factfinder to conclude that the employer's\nproffered reason for hiring Frentzl was a pretext for its true reason.                     Yet\nthe   majority    speculates     as   to     the    employer's    actual   motivation     and\nconcludes that Brandt's discrimination claim should not have even survived\na motion for JAML.        Our court should not engage in such conjecture, which\nare essentially independent credibility determinations.                    Rather, because\nBrandt presented more than adequate evidence of sex discrimination to go\nto a factfinder, I would affirm the jury verdict and judgment of the\ndistrict court in favor of Brandt.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\f     Brandt   established   the   elements   of   a   prima   facie   case   of   sex\ndiscrimination.   First, as a woman, Brandt is a member of a protected\nclass.   Second, she applied for and was qualified for the position of an\napprentice meat cutter.     In August 1990, Brandt submitted an application\nto Shop 'n Save for the position and her four-year experience as a meat\nclerk prepared her for nearly all of the necessary duties of a meat cutter\nand certainly of an apprentice.     Third, despite Brandt's qualifications,\nshe was rejected in favor of a male applicant under circumstances that give\nrise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.       At the time she submitted\nher application, she interviewed for the position and was told that\nalthough the company could not hire her at the time, her application would\nremain in the active file for one year.       Less than a year after Brandt's\ninterview, Shop 'n Save hired Frentzl, who had not even filled out an\nemployment application and who had absolutely no meat-cutting experience.\nUnder the McDonnell-Douglas framework, Brandt's establishment of a prima\nfacie case created a legal presumption of sex discrimination that, if\nunrebutted, would have entitled her to judgment as a matter of law.               St.\nMary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993).\n\n\n     To prevent entry of such judgment, Shop 'n Save had the burden to\narticulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.                The\ncompany stated that it hired Frentzl rather than promote Brandt because\nFrentzl had management experience and some college education and because\nthe decisionmakers were not even aware that Brandt was an applicant for the\nposition when Frentzl was hired.    At this point, the legal presumption of\ndiscrimination from Brandt's prima facie case disappeared; yet, as our\ncourt recently clarified en banc, the elements of the prima facie case\nremain as evidence from which the factfinder may infer discrimination.\nRyther v. KARE 11, No. 94-3622, slip op. at 5-6. (8th Cir. Mar. 6, 1997)\n(citing Hicks, 509 U.S. at 511).     As Justice Powell has explained:\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f     In saying that the presumption drops from the case, we do not\n     imply that the trier of fact no longer may consider evidence\n     previously introduced by the plaintiff to establish a prima\n     facie case.     A satisfactory explanation by the defendant\n     destroys the legally mandatory inference of discrimination\n     arising from the plaintiff's initial evidence. Nonetheless,\n     this evidence and inferences properly drawn therefrom may be\n     considered by the trier of fact on the issue of whether the\n     defendant's explanation is pretextual. Indeed, there may be\n     some cases where the plaintiff's initial evidence, combined\n     with effective cross-examination of the defendant, will suffice\n     to discredit the defendant's explanation.\n\n\nTexas v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255 n.10 (1991); see also Sheridan v. E.\nI. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 100 F.3d 1061, 1069 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc).\n\n\n     In addition to her prima facie case, Brandt presented an arsenal of\nevidence to discredit Shop 'n Save's articulated reasons for hiring\nFrentzl.   She alleged that Shop 'n Save pre-selected Frentzl for the\nposition and tailored the job qualifications to fit him.    Frentzl was the\nonly person Shop 'n Save ever hired for the apprentice position with the\n\"special\" job qualifications.   Further, it is questionable whether Frentzl\neven possessed the qualifications for which he was allegedly hired or, as\nthe majority notes, that the decisionmakers actually had any interest in\nhis education or management experience.    Evidence of pre-selection and the\ncreation of a position tailored to Frentzl's qualifications reasonably and\neffectively could have discredited Shop n' Save's explanation.    See Coble\nv. Hot Springs Sch. Dist. No. 6, 682 F.2d 721, 729 (8th Cir. 1982).\nMoreover, Shop 'n Save's decision cannot be defended on the basis of the\nrelative qualifications of the applicants if those qualifications were not\neven considered.    See Easland v. Tennessee Valley Auth., 704 F.2d 613, 625\n(11th Cir. 1983).    Further calling into question the veracity of Shop 'n\nSave's proffered reason, three and a half years after the company hired\nFrentzl it had yet to promote him to a management position.      Brandt also\nintroduced evidence that the majority of Shop 'n Save's\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fmeat clerks were female and, at the time of trial, Shop 'n Save had only\nhired one female meat cutter.            The evidence that Shop 'n Save has\nconsistently maintained a workforce segregated by gender further buttressed\nBrandt's discrimination claim.      See Lams v. General Waterworks Corp., 766\nF.2d 386 (8th Cir. 1985).\n\n\n     Brandt's strong challenges to the defendant's proffered reasons\nprovided additional evidence from which the factfinder could have inferred\nthat Shop 'n Save's decision was actually motivated by discrimination.              As\nour court en banc just restated:\n\n\n     \"[W]hen all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have\n     been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer's actions,\n     it is more likely than not the employer, who we generally\n     assume acts only with some reasons, based his decision on an\n     impermissible consideration such as [sex].\"\n\n\nRyther, No. 94-3622, slip op. at 6 (quoting Furnco Const. Corp. v. Waters,\n438 U.S. 567, 577 (1977)).      Or, as Judge Posner put it in his decision for\nthe Seventh Circuit en banc, \"If the employer offers a pretext--a phony\nreason--for why it fired the employee, then the trier of fact is permitted,\nalthough not compelled, to infer that the real reason was [sex].\"              Visser\nv. Packer Eng'g Assoc., 924 F.2d 655 (7th Cir. 1991) (en banc).\n\n\n     I recognize that evidence of pretext may not support a reasonable\ninference of discrimination in some cases.         \"[E]vidence of pretext will not\nby itself be enough to make a submissible case if it is, standing alone,\ninconsistent with a reasonable inference of age discrimination.\"              Ryther,\nNo. 94-3622, slip op. at 7.            For example, in Rothmeier v. Investment\nAdvisers,   Inc.,   85   F.3d   1328    (8th    Cir.   1996),   where   the   employee\ndiscredited the employer's reason for his discharge by acknowledging that\nhe was fired for confronting his employer about alleged SEC violations,\nclearly no inference of discrimination remained.            Id. at 1335.      But this\nis\n\n\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fnot a Rothmeier-type case.   Brandt's pretext evidence does not point to a\nnondiscriminatory reason for passing her over nor has she offered or\nacknowledged such a justification.     Rather, Brandt vigorously maintains\nthat Shop 'n Save's decision was actually gender-motivated.\n\n\n     Shop 'n Save has consistently argued that it hired Frentzl because\nhe was more qualified and because the decisionmakers did not know Brandt\nwas an applicant, asserting this position to the district court before,\nduring, and after the trial, and continuing to do so before this court.\nNeither the jury, in considering the MHRA claim, nor the district court for\nthe Title VII claim accepted this explanation.      Nor does the majority,\nexplicitly finding that the defendant's articulated reasons for hiring\nFrentzl were fabricated.     Yet, after discrediting Shop 'n Save's given\nreason, the majority creates its own, nondiscriminatory explanation for the\ndefendant's employment decision.   The majority reaches out and speculates\nthat Frentzl was actually hired because of Dougherty's loyalty to an old\nfriend.    If Shop 'n Save's reason for hiring Frentzl was as the majority\ndetermined, Shop 'n Save could have and should have advanced this reason\nbefore the trial court, where it could have been subjected to a legitimate\ninquiry.   Shop 'n Save should not benefit from failing to assert the \"true\"\nreason for its decision to the district court.        As the Third Circuit\nstated:\n\n\n     We routinely expect that a party give honest testimony in a\n     court of law; there is no reason to expect less of an employer\n     charged with unlawful discrimination. If the employer fails to\n     come forth with the true and credible explanation and instead\n     keeps a hidden agenda, it does so at its own peril.      Under\n     those circumstances, there is no policy to be served by\n     refusing to permit the jury to infer that the real motivation\n     is the one that the plaintiff has charged.\n\n\nSheridan, 100 F.3d at 1069.      There is no basis in the record for the\nmajority's speculation.    Even if there were, however, it would\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fbe for the factfinder--not this court--to consider in determining the\nemployer's motive.       We need not decide whether a nonbusiness- related\nreason for rejecting a qualified woman in favor of a less- qualified,\npersonal friend of a supervisor may ever be the basis for a summary\njudgment against such a claimant.      Suffice it to say that Shop 'n Save's\narticulated reason smacked of pretext, and it was proper for the factfinder\nto infer that its real motivation was as Brandt charged.\n\n\n        The   properly   instructed   jury   determined   that   Shop   'n   Save\ndiscriminated against Brandt on the basis of her sex in violation of the\nMHRA.     The district court then made specific findings of fact and\nindependently determined that Shop 'n Save similarly violated Title VII.\nWe should not reverse the verdicts for insufficient evidence unless, after\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdicts, no\nreasonable factfinder could have returned a verdict for the nonmoving\nparty.    Ryther, No. 94-3622, slip op. at 4.     The district court properly\ndenied Shop 'n Save's motion for JAML.        I would affirm the court in all\nrespects and award Brandt the damages to which she is entitled.\n\n\n        A true copy.\n\n\n              Attest:\n\n\n                   CLERK, U. S.

We reverse.\n\n\n     Brandt, a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW)\nLocal 88 labor union, worked as a \"casual\" meat wrapper out of the union\nhall from 1987 to July 1991.1         That is, she worked for Shop 'n Save and\nother grocery stores on an \"as needed,\" temporary\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The 1993 UFCW Local 88 collective bargaining agreement with\nShop 'n Save now calls the meat wrapper position \"meat clerk,\" and\nhas broadened the job description to include all duties previously\nassigned the \"meat cutter\" position, except operating a band saw.\n\fbasis.2    The Shop 'n Save employees who knew Brandt and worked with her,\nwithout exception, praised her work.       In August 1990, Brandt sent a letter\nto Richard Marty, then acting senior vice president of human resources for\nShop 'n Save, and a similar letter to Harold \"Butch\" Covili, Shop 'n Save's\nsenior vice president of operations, expressing interest in joining Shop\n'n Save as a permanent employee, in a position as, in her words, a \"female\napprentice meat cutter,\" or in front-end management or co-management.               As\na courtesy, Marty interviewed Brandt on September 7, 1990, and told her\nthen and in a follow-up letter dated ten days later that Shop 'n Save did\nnot have a position to offer her.          Marty's letter said Brandt's resume\nwould be retained in Shop 'n Save's \"active files\" for one year.                Brandt\ntestified that, in the same time frame, she also told Danny Howard, who was\none of three \"meat specialists\" each assigned to supervise meat operations\nat approximately one-third of Shop n' Save's twenty-eight stores, of her\ninterest in an apprentice meat cutter position with Shop 'n Save.                As of\ntrial, Shop 'n Save had only one female meat cutter, who had been hired by\nthe company when it acquired a Kroger store where she was employed.                The\nevidence also shows that, of the 600-650 meat cutters on Local 88's\nmembership roster at that time, only three or four were female.\n\n\n       In May 1991, Marty hired John Dougherty to fill the position of\nsenior vice president of human resources, the position Marty himself had\nbeen holding temporarily, and Marty returned to his position with Shop 'n\nSave's parent corporation.    At this time, Covili also was no longer working\nin Shop 'n Save's St. Louis office.         So Marty and Covili were out of the\npicture as far as the day-to-day operations of Shop 'n Save's St. Louis\narea   stores   were   concerned,   but    Howard,   who   also   knew   of   Brandt's\nambitions, was still working for the company as a meat specialist.              During\nthe\n\n\n\n\n       2\n     In July 1991, Brandt was hired by Shop 'n Save as a permanent\nemployee, working as a meat wrapper (now meat clerk).\n\n                                          -2-\n\fmonth of May, after Dougherty was hired, the events leading up to Brandt's\nlawsuit transpired, although the record does not establish a precise\nsequence.\n\n\n     Sometime during the month, after Dougherty assumed his duties, he\nreceived a call from Bob Frentzel, an old friend he had known since 1966.\nFrentzel had experienced some employment setbacks since 1988, and in fact\nhad been unemployed for five months before he called Dougherty.     He sought\nwhatever employment assistance Dougherty could offer.           Also in May,\nDougherty, together with Bill Fant, Shop 'n Save's meat manager, who had\noverall responsibility for the meat departments in all area stores, decided\nto hire an apprentice meat cutter, someone with management experience and\n\"some college,\" but not necessarily any meat experience.       The apprentice\nmeat cutter job description in the UFCW Local 88 contract with Shop 'n Save\nin effect at that time did not say that the apprentice position was a\nmanagement position, nor did the job description give any indication that\nany college education would be preferred, much less required, of the\nsuccessful meat cutter apprentice.   Dougherty and Fant's ostensible goal,\nhowever, was to move the person who was hired for the job into management\nafter the two-year meat cutter apprenticeship was completed.     This was the\nfirst time (and the last, as it turns out) that Shop 'n Save created an\napprentice meat cutter position, although the union contract allowed one\nsuch position in each store if Local 88 gave its permission, as it did in\nthis case.\n\n\n     In hiring a person to fill this new job, Dougherty and Fant never\nsearched the \"active files\" for potential candidates who might have applied\nfor employment with Shop 'n Save before the apprentice position was\ncreated.    The job was never posted or otherwise advertised.    Frentzel was\nthe only person interviewed or even considered to fill the position.\nDougherty, Fant, and Howard (who reported to Fant) all participated in the\nhiring of Frentzel.   Frentzel had management experience, although not for\nseveral years;\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fhe had \"some college,\" although serious doubt was cast upon both just how\nmuch \"some\" is and the extent to which the decision-makers were genuinely\ninterested in that aspect of Frentzel's background; and he had virtually\nno meat experience.       Brandt had neither management experience nor \"some\ncollege,\" but she did have extensive meat experience.             By June 3, 1991, Bob\nFrentzel was on the job in the apprentice position, at the Shop 'n Save\nstore where Brandt happened to be working as a meat wrapper out of the\nunion hall.    As of the date of trial on Brandt's claims, three and one-half\nyears after he was hired and one and one-half years after he completed the\napprentice    program,    Frentzel    had    not   been    promoted    to   a   management\nposition, despite the fact that Shop 'n Save had filled several openings\nfor such positions with other individuals.\n\n\n     The     same   day   Frentzel   went    to    work   for   Shop   'n   Save,   Brandt\nconfronted Dougherty and told him she had previously submitted a resume and\nhad expressed an interest in a position as an apprentice meat cutter.                  She\ntold Dougherty she believed his failure to consider her for the apprentice\njob was sex discrimination.          Two weeks later, Brandt filed a charge of\nemployment discrimination against Shop 'n Save with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission and the Missouri Commission on Human Rights.                 Brandt\nfiled suit against Shop 'n Save in May 1992, alleging sex discrimination\nand retaliation in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17,\nand the comparable Missouri employment discrimination law, Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§§ 213.010-.126.      Trial was held before a jury and, by consent of the\nparties and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), before a magistrate judge.                 The\njury found for Shop 'n Save on Brandt's claim of retaliation, but for\nBrandt on her claim of sex discrimination.                The jury further determined\nthat Shop 'n Save's conduct in this matter was such that punitive damages\nwere warranted.     In addition, in derogation of the court's instructions,\nthe jury specified not only an amount of punitive damages (which was\nsupposed to be determined in a later proceeding and for which the jury had\nno evidence), but also that Shop 'n Save\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fshould pay Brandt's attorney fees.   After disposing of post-trial motions,\nthe Magistrate Judge entered judgment on the jury's verdict, awarding\nBrandt equitable relief and $22,500 in compensatory damages.     The court\nalso awarded Brandt $35,000 in punitive damages and $39,852.25 in attorney\nfees and costs.   Judgment was entered in favor of Shop 'n Save on Brandt's\nclaim of retaliation.   Shop 'n Save appeals.\n\n\n     For its first issue on appeal, Shop 'n Save contends that the court\nerred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law (JAML).     We\nreview de novo, \"applying the same standard as the district court and\noverturning the verdict only if the evidence, viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party, is insufficient to support the verdict.\"\nKarcher v.

We conclude, after\nde novo review and giving Brandt the benefit of all reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\finferences that might be drawn from the evidence, that the jury's finding\nof unlawful discrimination cannot be sustained as there is insufficient\nevidence to support it, and that Shop 'n Save was entitled to judgment as\na matter of law on Brandt's claims of sex discrimination.\n\n\n        Shop 'n Save contends that it proffered a legitimate reason for\nhiring Frentzel instead of Brandt.      According to the company, Brandt was\nnot qualified to fill the apprentice position as it was conceived by\nDougherty and Fant, because she had neither management experience nor \"some\ncollege.\"    We have carefully reviewed the record in this case, and we are\nconfident that the jury easily might have found that Shop 'n Save--\nDougherty specifically, with Fant's assistance--created the apprentice meat\ncutter position and its qualifications with the express purpose of hiring\nFrentzel to fill it, that is, that Shop n' Save's proffered \"legitimate\nreason\" was a fabrication, a pretext for its true reasons.                We are so\npersuaded    ourselves.    But   notwithstanding     Shop   'n   Save's    arguable\ndissembling about its reasons for hiring Frentzel, we do not believe that\nBrandt has met her burden of proving that the pretext was intended to\nconceal unlawful discrimination or that her gender in any way motivated the\nhiring of Frentzel instead of Brandt.        The \"fact sensitive\" issue at this\nstage of the analysis is \"whether the employee has provided evidence from\nwhich    a   reasonable   factfinder   could     conclude   that   the     employer\nintentionally discriminated against the employee for a prohibited reason.\"\nRothmeier v. Investment Advisers, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719644\"><a href=\"/opinion/719644/steven-g-rothmeier-v-investment-advisers-inc-a-minnesota-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1334 (8th Cir. 1996).\nWe hold that she has not.\n\n\n        The evidence shows that Frentzel took advantage of his \"network\" to\nland the apprentice meat cutter position, and that Dougherty obliged his\nfriend by supporting his application for the position, if not creating a\ntailor-made position for Frentzel.       We do not condone the exclusion of\nBrandt as a viable candidate on this basis.       But it is not intentional sex\ndiscrimination for\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fDougherty to hire an unemployed old friend who happens to be male, without\nconsidering an applicant who is neither unemployed nor an old friend and\nhappens to be female.        An employer's business decision concerning hiring\nneed   not   be   a   good    decision   to    withstand    a     challenge   for   sex\ndiscrimination; it is enough that it not be motivated by the gender of the\nemployee who is adversely affected by the decision.             The proof at trial was\nthat Shop 'n Save had hired no males or females to be apprentice meat\ncutters before Frentzel, and has hired none since.          It is apparent that the\nposition was created for Frentzel, with the job's \"qualifications\" tailored\nto Frentzel's background, rather than that Frentzel coincidentally and\nfortuitously happened into a just-created position that required his\n\"qualifications.\"      The fact that Frentzel has yet to be promoted to a\nmanagement position lends credence to that inference.               But such actions,\nalthough unfair from the standpoint of Brandt and persons of either gender\nwho are similarly situated, are not a violation of state and federal laws\nprohibiting sex discrimination in employment.

The evidence suggests\nthat at no time during the proceedings did Shop 'n Save fully acknowledge\nthe reasons Frentzel was selected to fill the apprentice meat cutter\nposition, and the jury evidently found the company's prevarication not at\nall to its liking.

This is a\ncase “where the evidence of pretext is inconsistent with an inference of\nintentional discrimination.”          Id., slip op. at 7 n.2.            Of course, Brandt\nwas   free   to   “rely    on   the   same    evidence    to     prove   both   pretext    and\ndiscrimination,” but that does not prevent our reversal of the denial of\nShop ‘n Save’s motion for JAML where “the evidence is insufficient for a\nreasonable trier of fact to infer unlawful discrimination.”                  Id. at 35 n.13\n(Loken, J., in a partial separate concurrence commanding a majority of the\nCourt en banc.)\n\n\n        Shop 'n Save raises a number of other issues in its appeal.                    Because\nof our disposition of the first issue, it is unnecessary for us to consider\nthose that remain.\n\n\n        The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is\nremanded with instructions for the court to enter judgment for Shop 'n\nSave.\n\n\nHEANEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n\n        I   respectfully     dissent.         The    majority     concedes      that   Brandt\nestablished a prima facie case of sex discrimination and that she presented\nsufficient evidence for a factfinder to conclude that the employer's\nproffered reason for hiring Frentzl was a pretext for its true reason.                     Yet\nthe   majority    speculates     as   to     the    employer's    actual   motivation     and\nconcludes that Brandt's discrimination claim should not have even survived\na motion for JAML.        Our court should not engage in such conjecture, which\nare essentially independent credibility determinations.                    Rather, because\nBrandt presented more than adequate evidence of sex discrimination to go\nto a factfinder, I would affirm the jury verdict and judgment of the\ndistrict court in favor of Brandt.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\f     Brandt   established   the   elements   of   a   prima   facie   case   of   sex\ndiscrimination.   First, as a woman, Brandt is a member of a protected\nclass.   Second, she applied for and was qualified for the position of an\napprentice meat cutter.     In August 1990, Brandt submitted an application\nto Shop 'n Save for the position and her four-year experience as a meat\nclerk prepared her for nearly all of the necessary duties of a meat cutter\nand certainly of an apprentice.     Third, despite Brandt's qualifications,\nshe was rejected in favor of a male applicant under circumstances that give\nrise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.       At the time she submitted\nher application, she interviewed for the position and was told that\nalthough the company could not hire her at the time, her application would\nremain in the active file for one year.       Less than a year after Brandt's\ninterview, Shop 'n Save hired Frentzl, who had not even filled out an\nemployment application and who had absolutely no meat-cutting experience.\nUnder the McDonnell-Douglas framework, Brandt's establishment of a prima\nfacie case created a legal presumption of sex discrimination that, if\nunrebutted, would have entitled her to judgment as a matter of law.

Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506 (1993).\n\n\n     To prevent entry of such judgment, Shop 'n Save had the burden to\narticulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.                The\ncompany stated that it hired Frentzl rather than promote Brandt because\nFrentzl had management experience and some college education and because\nthe decisionmakers were not even aware that Brandt was an applicant for the\nposition when Frentzl was hired.    At this point, the legal presumption of\ndiscrimination from Brandt's prima facie case disappeared; yet, as our\ncourt recently clarified en banc, the elements of the prima facie case\nremain as evidence from which the factfinder may infer discrimination.\nRyther v. KARE 11, No. 94-3622, slip op. at 5-6. (8th Cir. Mar. 6, 1997)\n(citing Hicks, 509 U.S. at 511).     As Justice Powell has explained:\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f     In saying that the presumption drops from the case, we do not\n     imply that the trier of fact no longer may consider evidence\n     previously introduced by the plaintiff to establish a prima\n     facie case.     A satisfactory explanation by the defendant\n     destroys the legally mandatory inference of discrimination\n     arising from the plaintiff's initial evidence. Nonetheless,\n     this evidence and inferences properly drawn therefrom may be\n     considered by the trier of fact on the issue of whether the\n     defendant's explanation is pretextual. Indeed, there may be\n     some cases where the plaintiff's initial evidence, combined\n     with effective cross-examination of the defendant, will suffice\n     to discredit the defendant's explanation.\n\n\nTexas v.

She alleged that Shop 'n Save pre-selected Frentzl for the\nposition and tailored the job qualifications to fit him.    Frentzl was the\nonly person Shop 'n Save ever hired for the apprentice position with the\n\"special\" job qualifications.   Further, it is questionable whether Frentzl\neven possessed the qualifications for which he was allegedly hired or, as\nthe majority notes, that the decisionmakers actually had any interest in\nhis education or management experience.    Evidence of pre-selection and the\ncreation of a position tailored to Frentzl's qualifications reasonably and\neffectively could have discredited Shop n' Save's explanation.    See Coble\nv.

Further calling into question the veracity of Shop 'n\nSave's proffered reason, three and a half years after the company hired\nFrentzl it had yet to promote him to a management position.      Brandt also\nintroduced evidence that the majority of Shop 'n Save's\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fmeat clerks were female and, at the time of trial, Shop 'n Save had only\nhired one female meat cutter.            The evidence that Shop 'n Save has\nconsistently maintained a workforce segregated by gender further buttressed\nBrandt's discrimination claim.      See Lams v.

As\nour court en banc just restated:\n\n\n     \"[W]hen all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have\n     been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer's actions,\n     it is more likely than not the employer, who we generally\n     assume acts only with some reasons, based his decision on an\n     impermissible consideration such as [sex].\"\n\n\nRyther, No. 94-3622, slip op. at 6 (quoting Furnco Const.

Brandt's pretext evidence does not point to a\nnondiscriminatory reason for passing her over nor has she offered or\nacknowledged such a justification.     Rather, Brandt vigorously maintains\nthat Shop 'n Save's decision was actually gender-motivated.\n\n\n     Shop 'n Save has consistently argued that it hired Frentzl because\nhe was more qualified and because the decisionmakers did not know Brandt\nwas an applicant, asserting this position to the district court before,\nduring, and after the trial, and continuing to do so before this court.\nNeither the jury, in considering the MHRA claim, nor the district court for\nthe Title VII claim accepted this explanation.      Nor does the majority,\nexplicitly finding that the defendant's articulated reasons for hiring\nFrentzl were fabricated.     Yet, after discrediting Shop 'n Save's given\nreason, the majority creates its own, nondiscriminatory explanation for the\ndefendant's employment decision.   The majority reaches out and speculates\nthat Frentzl was actually hired because of Dougherty's loyalty to an old\nfriend.    If Shop 'n Save's reason for hiring Frentzl was as the majority\ndetermined, Shop 'n Save could have and should have advanced this reason\nbefore the trial court, where it could have been subjected to a legitimate\ninquiry.   Shop 'n Save should not benefit from failing to assert the \"true\"\nreason for its decision to the district court.        As the Third Circuit\nstated:\n\n\n     We routinely expect that a party give honest testimony in a\n     court of law; there is no reason to expect less of an employer\n     charged with unlawful discrimination. If the employer fails to\n     come forth with the true and credible explanation and instead\n     keeps a hidden agenda, it does so at its own peril.      Under\n     those circumstances, there is no policy to be served by\n     refusing to permit the jury to infer that the real motivation\n     is the one that the plaintiff has charged.\n\n\nSheridan, 100 F.3d at 1069.      There is no basis in the record for the\nmajority's speculation.    Even if there were, however, it would\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fbe for the factfinder--not this court--to consider in determining the\nemployer's motive.       We need not decide whether a nonbusiness- related\nreason for rejecting a qualified woman in favor of a less- qualified,\npersonal friend of a supervisor may ever be the basis for a summary\njudgment against such a claimant.      Suffice it to say that Shop 'n Save's\narticulated reason smacked of pretext, and it was proper for the factfinder\nto infer that its real motivation was as Brandt charged.\n\n\n        The   properly   instructed   jury   determined   that   Shop   'n   Save\ndiscriminated against Brandt on the basis of her sex in violation of the\nMHRA.     The district court then made specific findings of fact and\nindependently determined that Shop 'n Save similarly violated Title VII.\nWe should not reverse the verdicts for insufficient evidence unless, after\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdicts, no\nreasonable factfinder could have returned a verdict for the nonmoving\nparty.    Ryther, No. 94-3622, slip op. at 4.     The district court properly\ndenied Shop 'n Save's motion for JAML.
