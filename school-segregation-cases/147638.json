F. v. MICHAEL B.\n\n               Direct Appeal from the Circuit Court for Shelby County\n                    No. CT00182208     Karen R. Williams, Judge\n\n\n\n\n           No. W2013-01757-COA-R3-CV - Filed March 13, 2014\n\n\n\n       In this post-divorce case, Mother/Appellant appeals the trial court’s grant of\nFather/Appellee’s motion for involuntary dismissal of her petition to be named the primary\nresidential parent of the parties’ child. Implicitly finding that there has not been a material\nchange in circumstances since the entry of the last custodial order, the trial court granted\nFather’s Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 41.02(2) motion to dismiss Mother’s petition.\nThe trial court also denied Father’s request for attorney’s fees under Tennessee Code\nAnnotated Section 36-5-103(c). Because the trial court’s order does not comply with Rule\n41.02(2) in that it neither finds the facts specially upon which the court based its\ndetermination that there has been no material change in circumstances, nor indicates the\ncourt’s reason(s) for denial of Father’s request for attorney’s fees, we are unable to conduct\na meaningful review. Vacated and remanded.\n\n Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Vacated and\n                                    Remanded\n\nJ. S TEVEN S TAFFORD, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which D AVID R. F ARMER, J.,\njoined, and H OLLY M. K IRBY, J., filed a separate concurring opinion.\n\nMitzi C. Johnson, Collierville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Kathryne B. F.\n\nDavid F. Kustoff, Memphis, Tennessee, for the appellee, Michael B.\n\n\n\n                                         OPINION\n\f       Both the procedural and factual histories in this case are largely undisputed. Michael\nB. (“Father,” or “Appellee”) and Kathryne B. F. (“Mother,” or “Appellant”) were divorced\nby final decree entered on July 16, 2008. One child, Caleb M. B., was born to the marriage\nin October 2006.1 At the time of their divorce, the parties entered into a permanent\nparenting plan, whereby Mother was designated as the child’s primary residential parent, and\nFather was awarded 118 days of parenting time.\n\n        In 2011, Mother became engaged to a resident of Australia. On January 6, 2011, to\nprevent Mother from moving to Australia with the child, Father filed a petition opposing\nremoval of the child from the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Shelby County. Mother\nopposed the petition. Mother married her Australian fiancé in early March of 2011.\nThereafter, on March 24, 2011, the trial court heard Father’s petition. On May 5, 2011, the\ncourt issued a letter ruling, wherein it granted Father’s petition. Although the court found\nthat there was “no vindictive” motive for Mother’s move to Australia, and that the move had\na “reasonable purpose,” the court ultimately held that relocation posed a “threat of specific\nand serious harm to the child.” Tenn. Code Ann. §36-6-108(d)(2). In reaching its decision,\nthe court noted that:\n\n                       The parties in this case . . . have enjoyed, since the child’s\n                birth 4 years ago, a nearly ideal co-parenting relationship that\n                included both sets of grandparents and nearly seamless transition\n                from one home to the other.\n\n                *                                         *                          *\n\n                       Both parties agree that the child spends substantially\n                more time with Mother than with Father. However, the Court\n                notes that if you segregate out the time spent with grandparents,\n                then the parents are more nearly equal.\n\n                *                                             *                          *\n\n                [T]he child has been raised by his Mother, his Father, his\n                maternal grandparents and his paternal grandparents . . . . Both\n                [parents] agree that the grandparents have been actively\n                involved in the day-to-day life of this child.\n\n\n\n        1\n          In cases involving minor children, it is this Court’s policy to redact names to protect the\nchildren’s identity.\n\n                                                      2\n\fBased upon the foregoing findings, the court concluded that Father had proven a risk of\nsubstantial harm under the parental relocation statute. The court then weighed the relocation\nfactors outlined at Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-6-108(e) using a “best interest”\nanalysis, and ultimately changed the child’s primary residential parent from Mother to Father.\nThe trial court entered an order reflecting that decision on June 8, 2011, nunc pro tunc, to\nMay 5, 2011. In its ruling, the court focused primarily on Section 36-6-108(e)(5), i.e., “the\nimportance of continuity in the child’s life and the length of time the child has lived in a\nstable, satisfactory environment,” noting that staying with Father “would permit [the child]\nto continue to be involved with his Father and both sets of grandparents as he is accustomed\nto being.” The court also focused on Section 36-6-108(e)(6), i.e., “[t]he stability of the\nfamily unit of the parents,” noting that Mother’s new husband had “testified that he is not a\n‘child guy’ and has little experience with children.” Although the court went on to note that\nMother’s husband seemed to have “taken to parenting and appears to enjoy it so far,” it noted\nthat full-time parenting would be “a very large change for him to adjust to . . . .” The parties\nwere ordered to present a parenting plan to the court; however, this parenting plan was not\nentered in the trial court until March 1, 2012. Father testified that the delay was caused\nbecause the parties had difficulty coming to terms on certain aspects of the parenting plan.\nUltimately, the parties agreed to the essential terms of the parenting plan. Under the plan,\nCaleb spends alternating Christmas breaks with his Mother in Australia. He spends his\nsummer vacations with Mother, and Mother has the option of having Caleb on his breaks.\nIn addition, the parenting plan indicates that should Mother choose to be in the United States,\nthe child may stay primarily with her for up to six weeks in the United States, and that the\nparties will ostensibly revert back to the schedule they had when Mother was primary\nresidential parent. Mother did not appeal from the trial court’s order, naming Father as the\nchild’s primary residential parent and denying her permission to relocate to Australia with\nthe child. Accordingly, and as discussed infra, the order naming Father as the child’s\nprimary residential parent became res judicata on the subject of custody and, therefore, can\nonly be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances. Although some of\nMother’s arguments in her appellate brief tend to focus on the trial court’s ruling on Father’s\npetition opposing relocation and naming Father the primary residential parent, the June 8,\n2011 order is not the subject of the instant appeal. However, even though we are not\nreviewing the June 8, 2011 order, it is nonetheless germane to this appeal in that this order\noutlines the circumstances as they existed initially and against which the question of material\nchange is measured.\n\n       On January 31, 2013, Mother filed a petition to modify the parenting plan, which\npetition is the subject of the instant appeal. Therein, she alleged that there had been a\nsubstantial and material change of circumstances since the entry of the court’s June 8, 2011\norder. Mother averred a change in circumstances based upon her assertion that the “minor\nchild currently resides with the paternal grandmother . . . .” Mother asserted that:\n\n                                               3\n\f              [A]lthough Father is designated as the primary residential\n              parent, the minor child has primarily resided with and is being\n              raised by the paternal grandmother and not Father. Although it\n              was contemplated that the child would enjoy time with both sets\n              of grandparents, it certainly was not contemplated by Mother or\n              the Court that the Father would defer his parenting\n              responsibilities to the paternal grandmother and that she would\n              be the primary caregiver of the minor child.\n\n       Father opposed Mother’s petition, which was heard by the court on April 12, 2013,\nMay 28 and 31, 2013, and July 17, 2013. At the close of Mother’s proof, Father moved for\ninvoluntary dismissal of the petition, under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 41.02(2), on\nthe ground that Mother had not shown a material change in circumstances to warrant a\nchange of the child’s primary residential parent. The trial court did not immediately rule on\nthe motion; rather, it held the motion in abeyance until it heard Father’s evidence. At the\nclose of all evidence, Father renewed his motion for involuntary dismissal, and the trial court\ngranted the motion at that time. On July 30, 2013, the trial court entered an order, dismissing\nMother’s petition and denying Father’s request for attorney’s fees. The order incorporates,\nby reference, the trial court’s ruling from the bench, which we will discuss in detail below.\n\n       Mother appeals. She raises three issues for review as stated in her brief:\n\n              1. Whether the Circuit Court erred in granting [Father’s] motion\n              to dismiss the petition to modify [the] parenting plan?\n\n              2. Whether the Circuit Court erred in not modifying the\n              permanent parenting plan?\n\n              3. Appellant requests attorney fees on appeal?\n\nIn the posture of Appellee, Father raises the following, additional issues for review:\n\n              1. Whether the trial court erred in not granting Father’s request\n              for counsel fees at trial?\n\n              2. Father requests an award of counsel fees on appeal.\n\n\nAs noted above, this case was adjudicated upon the trial court’s grant of Father’s motion for\ninvoluntary dismissal pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 41.02(2). This Rule\n\n                                              4\n\fprovides:\n\n                After the plaintiff in an action tried by the court without a jury\n                has completed the presentation of plaintiff’s evidence, the\n                defendant, without waiving the right to offer evidence in the\n                event the motion is not granted, may move for dismissal on the\n                ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no\n                right to relief. The court shall reserve ruling until all parties\n                alleging fault against any other party have presented their\n                respective proof-in-chief. The court as trier of the facts may then\n                determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may\n                decline to render any judgment until the close of all the\n                evidence. If the court grants the motion for involuntary\n                dismissal, the court shall find the facts specially and shall state\n                separately its conclusion of law and direct the entry of the\n                appropriate judgment.\n\nA motion for involuntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41.02(2) challenges the sufficiency of\nthe plaintiff’s proof. Burton v. Warren Farmers Co-op., 129 S.W.3d 513, 520 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. 2002); Smith v. Inman Realty Co., 846 S.W.2d 819, 821 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992). A\nclaim may be dismissed pursuant to a Rule 41.02(2) motion if, based on the law and the\nevidence, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a right to the relief it is seeking. Id.; City of\nColumbia v. C.F.W. Constr. Co., 557 S.W.2d 734, 740 (Tenn. 1977). Motions under\nTennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 41.02(2) require less certainty than motions for directed\nverdict under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 50, governing motions for directed verdicts\nin jury trials.2 C.F.W. Constr., 557 S.W.2d at 740; Inman Realty Co., 846 S.W.2d at 822.\nThus, a court faced with a Rule 41 .02(2) motion need only impartially weigh and evaluate\nthe plaintiff’s evidence just as it would after all the parties had concluded their cases and may\ndismiss the plaintiff’s claims if the plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case by a\npreponderance of the evidence. Id. at 520–21; Thompson v. Adcox, 63 S.W.3d 783, 791\n\n\n        2\n          For purposes of edification, a Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 41.02 motion for involuntary\ndismissal in a bench trial is to be distinguished from a Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 50 motion for\ndirected verdict in a jury trial. See Burton, 129 S.W.3d 513. In the Burton case, the court explained that\n\"motions for directed verdicts have no place in bench trials, while Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.02(2) motions have\nno place in jury trials.\" Id. at 520. A Rule 50 motion for directed verdict provides a vehicle for deciding\nquestions of law. The question presented is whether the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to\ncreate an issue of fact for the jury to decide. Id. The courts do not weigh the evidence when they answer\nthis question, nor do they evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. Id. Rather, they review the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party, give the non-moving party the benefit of all reasonable\ninferences, and disregard all the evidence contrary to the non-moving party’s position. Id.\n\n                                                     5\n\f(Tenn. Ct. App. 2001).\n\n        The standard by which the appellate court reviews a trial court’s grant of a Rule 41.02\ninvoluntary dismissal is governed by Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 13(d). Building\nMaterials Corp. v. Britt, 211 S.W.3d 706, 711 (Tenn. 2007); Burton, 129 S.W.3d at 521.\nThis is because the trial court has used the same reasoning to dispose of the motion that it\nwould to make a final decision at the close of all the evidence. Burton, 129 S.W.3d at 521.\nThus, we review the record on appeal de novo with a presumption that the trial court’s factual\nfindings are correct and we will affirm the trial court’s decision unless the evidence\npreponderates against the trial court’s factual determinations or unless the trial court has\ncommitted an error of law affecting the outcome of the case. Id. We will also give great\nweight to the trial court’s assessment of the evidence because the trial court is in a much\nbetter position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. Id.\n\n                             Material Change in Circumstance\n\n        It is well settled that “[a] custody decision, once final, is res judicata upon the facts\nin existence or reasonably foreseeable when the decision was made.” Scofield v. Scofield,\nNo. M2006-00350-COA-R3-CV, 2007 WL 624351, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 28, 2007)\n(citing Young v. Smith, 246 S.W.2d 93, 95 (Tenn. 1952)); Steen v. Steen, 61 S.W.3d 324,\n327 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001); Solima v. Solima, 7 S.W.3d 30, 32 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998); Long\nv. Long, 488 S.W.2d 729, 731–32 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1972). However, because children’s and\nparents’ circumstances change, our courts are “empowered to alter custody arrangements\nwhen intervening circumstances require modifications.” Scofield, 2007 WL 624351, at *2\n(citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-101(a)(1)); see also Massengale v. Massengale, 915 S.W.2d\n818, 819 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995)).\n\n       Modification of an existing custody or visitation arrangement involves a two-step\nanalysis. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-101(a)(2)(B)–(C); see also Boyer v. Heimermann, 238\nS.W.3d 249, 255 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007). First, the parent attempting to modify the existing\ncustody or visitation arrangement must prove that a material change in circumstances has\noccurred. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-101(a)(2)(B)–(C); see also Taylor v. McKinnie, No.\nW2007-01468-COA-R3-JV, 2008 WL 2971767, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2008) (citing\nKendrick v. Shoemake, 90 S.W.3d 566, 570 (Tenn. 2002)). “We recognize that the\ncircumstances of children and their parents inevitably change-children grow older, their\nneeds change, one or both parties remarry. But not all changes in the circumstances of the\nparties and the child warrant a change in custody.” Cosner v. Cosner, No. E2007-02031-\nCOA-R3-CV, 2008 WL 3892024, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2008). “There are no hard\nand fast rules for when there has been a change of circumstances sufficient to justify a\nchange in custody.” Id. (citing Cranston v. Combs, 106 S.W.3d 641, 644 (Tenn. 2003)).\n\n                                               6\n\fHowever, to determine whether a material change in circumstances has occurred, the court\nshould consider whether: “(1) the change occurred after the entry of the order sought to be\nmodified; (2) the changed circumstances were not reasonably anticipated when the\nunderlying decree was entered; and (3) the change is one that affects the child’s well-being\nin a meaningful way.” Cosner, 2008 WL 3892024 at *4 (citing Kendrick, 90 S.W.3d at 570);\nsee also Cranston, 106 S.W.3d at 644; Blair v. Badenhope, 77 S.W.3d 137, 150\n(Tenn.2002).\n\n       We note that the determination of whether a “material change of circumstances” has\noccurred requires a different standard depending upon whether a parent is seeking to modify\ncustody (i.e., change the primary residential parent) or modify the residential parenting\nschedule. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-101(a)(2)(B)–(C); see also Pippin v. Pippin, 277 S.W.3d\n398, 406–07(Tenn. Ct. App. 2008) (citing Massey–Holt v. Holt, 255 S.W.3d 603 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. 2007)). As previously stated by this Court, “a ‘change in circumstance’ with regard to\nthe parenting schedule is a distinct concept from a ‘change in circumstance’ with regard to\nthe identity of the primary residential parent.” Massey–Holt, 255 S.W.3d at 607. Here, we\nare dealing with a petition to change the child’s primary residential parent from Father to\nMother. Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-6-101(a)(2)(B) discusses the requirement of\na material change in circumstances in this situation, stating:\n\n               If the issue before the court is a modification of the court’s prior\n               decree pertaining to custody, the petitioner must prove by a\n               preponderance of the evidence a material change in\n               circumstance. A material change of circumstance does not\n               require a showing of a substantial risk of harm to the child. A\n               material change of circumstance may include, but is not limited\n               to, failures to adhere to the parenting plan or an order of custody\n               and visitation or circumstances that make the parenting plan no\n               longer in the best interest of the child.3\n\n\n       3\n         In contrast, Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-6-101(a)(2)(C) establishes a lower\nthreshold for modification of a residential parenting schedule. Scofield, 2007 WL 624351, at *3 (citing\nRose v. Lashlee, No. M2005-00361-COA-R3-CV, 2006 WL 2390980, at *2, n.3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug.\n18, 2006) (holding that Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-6-101(a)(2)(C) “sets a very low threshold\nfor establishing a material change of circumstances”)). In pertinent part, Tennessee Code Annotated\nSection 36-6-101(a)(2)(C) provides:\n\n               If the issue before the court is a modification of the court’s prior decree\n               pertaining to a residential parenting schedule, then the petitioner must\n               prove by a preponderance of the evidence a material change of\n                                                                                  (continued...)\n\n                                                    7\n\f       If the petitioner makes a prima facie case for a material change in circumstances, then\nthe court must determine whether a change in custody or visitation is in the best interest of\nthe child. See Boyer v. Heimermann, 238 S.W.3d 249, 259 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007);.In re\nJ.C.S., No. M2007-02049-COA-R3-PT, 2008 WL 2924982, at *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 28,\n2008). This determination requires consideration of a number of factors, including those set\nforth at Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-6-106(a) to make an initial custody\ndetermination, and those set forth at Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-6-404(b) to\nfashion a residential schedule.\n\n      As noted above, the trial court incorporated its ruling from the bench into its July 30,\n2013 order by reference. The trial court’s ruling provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n                 The Court finds that there has been no material change of\n                 circumstance since the last hearing. At that time Caleb had been\n                 raised by his mother, his father, his paternal grandparents and\n                 his maternal grandparents. This Court will not punish any\n                 parent for being gainfully employed.\n                         So to say that it is—father is not being a good parent\n                 because he works what we used to call a split shift, 7:30 [a.m.]\n                 to 4:00 [p.m.], 8:30 [a.m.] to 5:00 [p.m.], 2:00 [p.m.] to 10:30\n                 [p.m.] in some random pattern, to punish him as a parent for\n                 doing that makes no sense. Likewise, if Caleb were to move to\n                 Australia, his mother works five days a week, 40 hours a week,\n                 but when he’s in Australia there are no grandparents to cover\n                 that time between when Caleb would leave school and when the\n                 parent would get home.\n                         Here’s our obstacle. Right now, Caleb is so young that\n                 he has to go to bed very early. That’s going to change over\n                 time. Also, during the school year, he has to get up very early\n                 to be able to be at school. . . .\n                         So with Caleb in Memphis here are the four choices that\n                 the Court believes father had: he could hire a live-in nanny . . .\n                 ; he could remarry and have a stay-at-home step-mother; he\n\n\n(...continued)\ncircumstance affecting the child’s best interest. A material change of circumstance does not require a\nshowing of a substantial risk of harm to the child. A material change of circumstance for purposes of\nmodification of a residential parenting schedule may include, but is not limited to, significant changes in the\nneeds of the child over time, which may include changes relating to age; significant changes in the parent’s\nliving or working condition that significantly affect parenting; failure to adhere to the parenting plan; or other\ncircumstances making a change in the residential parenting time in the best interest of the child.\n\n                                                        8\n\f              could move into his parents’ home; or he could have the\n              grandparents move into his home. The fifth choice was the\n              choice that he chose, that is, to allow the child to sleep in the\n              same bed every school night, to be there with him most nights\n              as he goes through his get-ready-for-bed ritual . . . . On\n              mornings when he’s not working he’s there to take the child to\n              school.\n                      I do not see any proof that father is not paying attention\n              to this child . . . . I don’t see that Caleb’s life is any different\n              now than it was before, and that’s—until that step is reached we\n              can’t go beyond.\n                      I’m going to dismiss the petition.\n\n        Before turning to the record, and as set out above, Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure\n41.02 mandates that “the court shall find the facts specially and shall state separately its\nconclusion of law.” As set out in context above, the trial court’s “findings” in this case are\nmore conclusions than findings. This Court has previously held that the General Assembly’s\ndecision to require findings of fact and conclusions of law is “not a mere technicality.” In\nre K.H., No. W2008-01144-COA-R3-PT, 2009 WL 1362314, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 15,\n2009). Instead, the requirement serves the important purpose of “facilitat[ing] appellate\nreview and promot[ing] the just and speedy resolution of appeals.” Id.; White v. Moody, 171\nS.W.3d 187, 191 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004); Bruce v. Bruce, 801 S.W.2d 102, 104 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp.1990). “Without such findings and conclusions, this court is left to wonder on what\nbasis the court reached its ultimate decision.” In re K.H., 2009 WL 1362314, at *8 (quoting\nIn re M.E. W., No. M2003-01739-COA-R3-PT, 2004 WL 865840, at *19 (Tenn. Ct. App.\nApril 21, 2004)). Without findings of fact, we cannot discern the basis for the trial court’s\ndecision, “and we are unable to afford appropriate deference to the trial court’s decision.”\nIn re Connor S.L., No. W2012-00587-COA-R3-JV, 2012 WL 5462839, at *4 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. Nov.8, 2012).\n\n        In making a determination of whether there has been a material change in\ncircumstances, we would expect the trial court to consider such questions as whether: “(1)\nthe change occurred after the entry of the order sought to be modified; (2) the changed\ncircumstances were not reasonably anticipated when the underlying decree was entered; and\n(3) the change is one that affects the child’s well-being in a meaningful way.” Cosner, 2008\nWL 3892024 at *4 (citing Kendrick, 90 S.W.3d at 570). While we recognize that there are\nno “no hard and fast rules for when there has been a change of circumstances sufficient to\njustify a change in custody,” id., we would anticipate that the trial court would synthesize the\nevidence it relied on and discuss it specifically in reaching its factual conclusions. Indeed,\nthe trial on this cause took place over four days and involved several witnesses and exhibits.\nHowever, the trial court failed to cite any evidence from the trial that was used to support its\ndecision. For example, in its statements above, the trial court concludes that: “I do not see\n\fany proof that father is not paying attention to this child . . . . I don’t see that Caleb’s life is\nany different now than it was before.” However, the court does not explain what evidence\nin the record led it to reach these conclusions. In this case, Mother argues that Caleb’s life\nhas changed because he is now spending every school night with his paternal grandparents.\nTo explain the trial court’s conclusion that this fact does not constitute a material change in\ncircumstances, the better practice would have been to note the existing circumstances, and\nthen evaluate the evidence to explain why that evidence did not lead to a conclusion that the\nchild’s circumstances changed. Without some discussion of the facts as they existed at the\ntime custody was vested with Father, this Court is unable to evaluate whether the\ncircumstances have, in fact, changed since that time. Additionally, the court devotes a\nsubstantial portion of its oral ruling to Father’s “four [or five] choices.” However, no\nevidence exists in the record to indicate that Father actually considered any of the “four\nchoices” the trial court outlines. Accordingly, the trial court’s statements are not instructive\nas to whether a material change in circumstances occurred in this case; discussion of the\nactual facts presented by the testimony and exhibits, and how those facts influenced the trial\ncourt’s decision, would have allowed this Court to give the trial court’s decision appropriate\ndeference and to determine where the preponderance of the evidence lies. As previously\ndiscussed, Rule 41.03 requires that the court make its findings “specially,” in these cases.\n“Specially,” denotes a measure of particularity and distinction that can only be accomplished\nby discussion of the evidence that is unique to the case.4 Considering the amount of evidence\nthat was presented in this case (i.e., some 555 pages of transcript, and 15 accompanying\nexhibits), we would anticipate the court’s “findings” to include discussion of the testimony\nand/or exhibits that the trial court relied upon or found particularly significant in reaching its\nconclusions. However, the anticipated findings are simply lacking in this case.\n\n        Generally, the appropriate remedy when a trial court fails to make appropriate findings\nof fact and conclusions of law is to “vacate the trial court’s judgment and remand the cause\nto the trial court for written findings of fact and conclusions of law.” Lake v. Haynes, No.\nW2010-00294-COA-R3-CV, 2011 WL 2361563, at *1 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 9, 2011).\nHowever, this Court has indicated that we may “soldier on” with our review despite the trial\ncourt’s failure to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law, in certain limited\ncircumstances:\n\n               On occasion, when a trial judge fails to make findings of fact\n               and conclusions of law, the appellate court “may ‘soldier on’\n\n\n       4\n          The Advisory Commission Comment to Rule 41.02(2) equates the trial court’s requirements\nunder this Rule to those requirements contemplated by Rule 52.01: “The final sentence of Rule 41.02(2)\ndeletes the requirement of a request for written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Instead, in\nconformity with Rule 52.01, findings of fact and conclusions of law are required without request.”\n\n                                                 10\n\f              when the case involves only a clear legal issue, or when the\n              court’s decision is ‘readily ascertainable.’” Hanson v. J.C.\n              Hobbs Co., Inc., No. W2011-02523-COA-R3-CV, 2012 WL\n              5873582, at *10 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 21, 2012) (quoting\n              Simpson v. Fowler, No. W2011-02112-COA-R3-CV, 2012 WL\n              3675321, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 28, 2012)).\n\n Pandey v. Shrivastava, No. W2012-00059-COA-R3-CV, 2013 WL 657799 (Tenn. Ct. App.\nFeb. 22, 2013). Here, the trial court held that there was no material change in circumstances\nto justify a change of the child’s primary residential parent. However, as noted above, we\ncannot ascertain the trial court’s reasoning from its order, or from the incorporated statements\nfrom the bench, supra. The determination of custody of a child is a very fact specific inquiry,\nand that inquiry is within the purview of the trial court, not the appellate court. See In re\nT.C.D., 261 S.W.3d 734, 742 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007) (“The determinations of whether a\nmaterial change in circumstances has occurred and where the best interests of the child lie\nare factual questions.”). Our role is to review those specific findings against the record.\nUnfortunately, because we do not know the basis of the court’s decision (i.e., what specific\nevidence the court relied upon in making its determination concerning change of\ncircumstances), we cannot perform our role of reviewing that decision. Accordingly, we\nmust vacate the order of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings,\nincluding, but not limited to, compliance with the mandates of Rule 41.02(2).\n\n       We note, however, that our holding should not be construed as limiting the trial court\nfrom considering additional evidence regarding how the parties’ circumstances have changed\nsince the entry of the trial court’s final order in July of 2013. This Court has previously\nrecognized that the circumstances of children and their parents change over time. See In re\nC. W., --- S.W.3d ----, 2013 WL 1501876, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. April 11, 2013). In In re\nC. W., the Tennessee Court of Appeals noted that when a trial court is directed to reconsider\nan issue on remand that involves the circumstances of children and their parents, “the trial\ncourt should endeavor to ascertain and give effect to the parties’ actual circumstances, which\nwill necessarily change over the course of time, e.g., people remarry, have more children,\ninsurance premiums rise and fall, and child care needs change.” Id. Accordingly, the trial\ncourt may, in its discretion, consider such additional evidence to insure that any custody order\nis based on “the parties’ actual circumstances.” Id.\n\n                                       Attorney’s Fees\n\n       In the posture of Appellee, Father appeals the trial court’s denial of his request for\nattorney’s fees incurred at the trial level. Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-5-103(c)\nprovides, in relevant part, that:\n\n                                              11\n\f              The plaintiff spouse may recover from the defendant spouse,\n              and the spouse or other person to whom the custody of the child,\n              or children, is awarded may recover from the other spouse\n              reasonable attorney fees incurred . . . in regard to any suit or\n              action concerning the adjudication of the custody or the change\n              of custody of any child, or children, of the parties, both upon the\n              original divorce hearing and at any subsequent hearing, which\n              fees may be fixed and allowed by the court, before whom such\n              action or proceeding is pending, in the discretion of such court.\n\n        This statute vests discretionary authority in the court to award such fees in custody\ncases. Shofner v. Shofner, 181 S.W.3d 703, 719 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004). “In determining\nwhether an award for attorney’s fees is warranted, we should consider, among other factors,\nthe ability of the requesting party to pay his or her own attorney’s fees, the requesting party’s\nsuccess on appeal, and whether the requesting party has been acting in good faith.” Id. (citing\nParchman v. Parchman, No. W2003-01204-COA-R3-CV, 2004 WL 2609198, at *6 (Tenn.\nCt. App. Nov.17, 2004)). We review the trial court’s decision concerning the award of\nattorney’s fees using the less stringent “abuse of discretion” standard of review. Richardson\nv. Spanos, 189 S.W.3d 720, 729 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005). Under the abuse of discretion\nstandard, a trial court’s ruling “will be upheld so long as reasonable minds can disagree as\nto the propriety of the decision made.” Eldridge v. Eldridge, 42 S.W.3d 82, 85 (Tenn. 2001)\n(citations omitted). A trial court abuses its discretion only when it “applies an incorrect legal\nstandard, or reaches a decision which is against logic or reasoning or that causes an injustice\nto the party complaining.” Id. The abuse of discretion standard does not permit the appellate\ncourt to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. Id.\n\n       It is well settled that a trial court speaks through its orders. Palmer v. Palmer, 562\nS.W.2d 833, 837 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997). In its order June 8, 2011, the trial court simply states\nthat Father’s request for attorney’s fees is denied, and provides no explanation for its\ndecision. Again, the lack of explanation in the court’s order stymies our ability to review the\ncourt’s decision for an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the order\ndenying Father’s attorney’s fees and remand for specific findings concerning the trial court’s\nreasons for the denial of Father’s request.\n\n       In addition, both parties ask this Court to award them their respective attorney’s fees\nand costs incurred in prosecuting and defending this appeal. We glean from Father’s brief\nthat he is seeking these fees on frivolous appeal grounds as his argument is that Mother\nbrought her petition in an effort to revisit the res judicata relocation issues. Tennessee Code\nAnnotated Section 27-1-122 provides:\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f              When it appears to any reviewing court that the appeal from any\n              court of record was frivolous or taken solely for delay, the court\n              may, either upon motion of a party or of its own motion, award\n              just damages against the appellant, which may include but need\n              not be limited to, costs, interest on the judgment, and expenses\n              incurred by the appellee as a result of the appeal.\n\nHowever, “[i]mposing a penalty for a frivolous appeal is a remedy which is to be used only\nin obvious cases of frivolity and should not be asserted lightly or granted unless clearly\napplicable, which is rare.” Henderson v. SAIA, Inc., 318 S.W.3d 328, 342 (Tenn.2010).\nBecause we are unable to properly review the trial court’s decision in this case, we cannot\nconclude that Mother’s petition was frivolous or brought for any vindictive purpose.\nAccordingly, Father is not entitled to his attorney’s fees for a frivolous appeal. Further, even\nif we assume, arguendo, that the parties are seeking their appellate attorney’s fees based\nupon Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-5-103(c), supra, given our decision to vacate\nthe judgment of the trial court, we decline to award such attorney’s fees at this time.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the order of the trial court, dismissing Mother’s\npetition and denying Father’s request for attorney’s fees. The case is remanded for such\nfurther proceedings as may be necessary and are consistent with this Opinion. Costs of the\nappeal are assessed one-half against the Appellant/Mother, and her surety, and one-half\nagainst the Appellee/Father, for all of which execution may issue if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    _________________________________\n                                                   J.

Because the trial court’s order does not comply with Rule\n41.02(2) in that it neither finds the facts specially upon which the court based its\ndetermination that there has been no material change in circumstances, nor indicates the\ncourt’s reason(s) for denial of Father’s request for attorney’s fees, we are unable to conduct\na meaningful review.

Michael\nB. (“Father,” or “Appellee”) and Kathryne B. F. (“Mother,” or “Appellant”) were divorced\nby final decree entered on July 16, 2008. One child, Caleb M. B., was born to the marriage\nin October 2006.1 At the time of their divorce, the parties entered into a permanent\nparenting plan, whereby Mother was designated as the child’s primary residential parent, and\nFather was awarded 118 days of parenting time.\n\n        In 2011, Mother became engaged to a resident of Australia. On January 6, 2011, to\nprevent Mother from moving to Australia with the child, Father filed a petition opposing\nremoval of the child from the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Shelby County. Mother\nopposed the petition. Mother married her Australian fiancé in early March of 2011.\nThereafter, on March 24, 2011, the trial court heard Father’s petition. On May 5, 2011, the\ncourt issued a letter ruling, wherein it granted Father’s petition. Although the court found\nthat there was “no vindictive” motive for Mother’s move to Australia, and that the move had\na “reasonable purpose,” the court ultimately held that relocation posed a “threat of specific\nand serious harm to the child.” Tenn. Code Ann. §36-6-108(d)(2). In reaching its decision,\nthe court noted that:\n\n                       The parties in this case . . . have enjoyed, since the child’s\n                birth 4 years ago, a nearly ideal co-parenting relationship that\n                included both sets of grandparents and nearly seamless transition\n                from one home to the other.\n\n                *                                         *                          *\n\n                       Both parties agree that the child spends substantially\n                more time with Mother than with Father. However, the Court\n                notes that if you segregate out the time spent with grandparents,\n                then the parents are more nearly equal.\n\n                *                                             *                          *\n\n                [T]he child has been raised by his Mother, his Father, his\n                maternal grandparents and his paternal grandparents . . . . Both\n                [parents] agree that the grandparents have been actively\n                involved in the day-to-day life of this child.\n\n\n\n        1\n          In cases involving minor children, it is this Court’s policy to redact names to protect the\nchildren’s identity.\n\n                                                      2\n\fBased upon the foregoing findings, the court concluded that Father had proven a risk of\nsubstantial harm under the parental relocation statute. The court then weighed the relocation\nfactors outlined at Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-6-108(e) using a “best interest”\nanalysis, and ultimately changed the child’s primary residential parent from Mother to Father.\nThe trial court entered an order reflecting that decision on June 8, 2011, nunc pro tunc, to\nMay 5, 2011. In its ruling, the court focused primarily on Section 36-6-108(e)(5), i.e., “the\nimportance of continuity in the child’s life and the length of time the child has lived in a\nstable, satisfactory environment,” noting that staying with Father “would permit [the child]\nto continue to be involved with his Father and both sets of grandparents as he is accustomed\nto being.” The court also focused on Section 36-6-108(e)(6), i.e., “[t]he stability of the\nfamily unit of the parents,” noting that Mother’s new husband had “testified that he is not a\n‘child guy’ and has little experience with children.” Although the court went on to note that\nMother’s husband seemed to have “taken to parenting and appears to enjoy it so far,” it noted\nthat full-time parenting would be “a very large change for him to adjust to . . . .” The parties\nwere ordered to present a parenting plan to the court; however, this parenting plan was not\nentered in the trial court until March 1, 2012. Father testified that the delay was caused\nbecause the parties had difficulty coming to terms on certain aspects of the parenting plan.\nUltimately, the parties agreed to the essential terms of the parenting plan. Under the plan,\nCaleb spends alternating Christmas breaks with his Mother in Australia. He spends his\nsummer vacations with Mother, and Mother has the option of having Caleb on his breaks.\nIn addition, the parenting plan indicates that should Mother choose to be in the United States,\nthe child may stay primarily with her for up to six weeks in the United States, and that the\nparties will ostensibly revert back to the schedule they had when Mother was primary\nresidential parent. Mother did not appeal from the trial court’s order, naming Father as the\nchild’s primary residential parent and denying her permission to relocate to Australia with\nthe child. Accordingly, and as discussed infra, the order naming Father as the child’s\nprimary residential parent became res judicata on the subject of custody and, therefore, can\nonly be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances. Although some of\nMother’s arguments in her appellate brief tend to focus on the trial court’s ruling on Father’s\npetition opposing relocation and naming Father the primary residential parent, the June 8,\n2011 order is not the subject of the instant appeal. However, even though we are not\nreviewing the June 8, 2011 order, it is nonetheless germane to this appeal in that this order\noutlines the circumstances as they existed initially and against which the question of material\nchange is measured.\n\n       On January 31, 2013, Mother filed a petition to modify the parenting plan, which\npetition is the subject of the instant appeal. Therein, she alleged that there had been a\nsubstantial and material change of circumstances since the entry of the court’s June 8, 2011\norder. Mother averred a change in circumstances based upon her assertion that the “minor\nchild currently resides with the paternal grandmother . . . .” Mother asserted that:\n\n                                               3\n\f              [A]lthough Father is designated as the primary residential\n              parent, the minor child has primarily resided with and is being\n              raised by the paternal grandmother and not Father. Although it\n              was contemplated that the child would enjoy time with both sets\n              of grandparents, it certainly was not contemplated by Mother or\n              the Court that the Father would defer his parenting\n              responsibilities to the paternal grandmother and that she would\n              be the primary caregiver of the minor child.\n\n       Father opposed Mother’s petition, which was heard by the court on April 12, 2013,\nMay 28 and 31, 2013, and July 17, 2013. At the close of Mother’s proof, Father moved for\ninvoluntary dismissal of the petition, under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 41.02(2), on\nthe ground that Mother had not shown a material change in circumstances to warrant a\nchange of the child’s primary residential parent. The trial court did not immediately rule on\nthe motion; rather, it held the motion in abeyance until it heard Father’s evidence. At the\nclose of all evidence, Father renewed his motion for involuntary dismissal, and the trial court\ngranted the motion at that time. On July 30, 2013, the trial court entered an order, dismissing\nMother’s petition and denying Father’s request for attorney’s fees. The order incorporates,\nby reference, the trial court’s ruling from the bench, which we will discuss in detail below.\n\n       Mother appeals. She raises three issues for review as stated in her brief:\n\n              1. Whether the Circuit Court erred in granting [Father’s] motion\n              to dismiss the petition to modify [the] parenting plan?\n\n              2. Whether the Circuit Court erred in not modifying the\n              permanent parenting plan?\n\n              3. Appellant requests attorney fees on appeal?\n\nIn the posture of Appellee, Father raises the following, additional issues for review:\n\n              1. Whether the trial court erred in not granting Father’s request\n              for counsel fees at trial?\n\n              2. Father requests an award of counsel fees on appeal.\n\n\nAs noted above, this case was adjudicated upon the trial court’s grant of Father’s motion for\ninvoluntary dismissal pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 41.02(2). This Rule\n\n                                              4\n\fprovides:\n\n                After the plaintiff in an action tried by the court without a jury\n                has completed the presentation of plaintiff’s evidence, the\n                defendant, without waiving the right to offer evidence in the\n                event the motion is not granted, may move for dismissal on the\n                ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no\n                right to relief. The court shall reserve ruling until all parties\n                alleging fault against any other party have presented their\n                respective proof-in-chief. The court as trier of the facts may then\n                determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may\n                decline to render any judgment until the close of all the\n                evidence. If the court grants the motion for involuntary\n                dismissal, the court shall find the facts specially and shall state\n                separately its conclusion of law and direct the entry of the\n                appropriate judgment.\n\nA motion for involuntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41.02(2) challenges the sufficiency of\nthe plaintiff’s proof.

Likewise, if Caleb were to move to\n                 Australia, his mother works five days a week, 40 hours a week,\n                 but when he’s in Australia there are no grandparents to cover\n                 that time between when Caleb would leave school and when the\n                 parent would get home.\n                         Here’s our obstacle. Right now, Caleb is so young that\n                 he has to go to bed very early. That’s going to change over\n                 time. Also, during the school year, he has to get up very early\n                 to be able to be at school. . . .\n                         So with Caleb in Memphis here are the four choices that\n                 the Court believes father had: he could hire a live-in nanny . . .\n                 ; he could remarry and have a stay-at-home step-mother; he\n\n\n(...continued)\ncircumstance affecting the child’s best interest. A material change of circumstance does not require a\nshowing of a substantial risk of harm to the child. A material change of circumstance for purposes of\nmodification of a residential parenting schedule may include, but is not limited to, significant changes in the\nneeds of the child over time, which may include changes relating to age; significant changes in the parent’s\nliving or working condition that significantly affect parenting; failure to adhere to the parenting plan; or other\ncircumstances making a change in the residential parenting time in the best interest of the child.\n\n                                                        8\n\f              could move into his parents’ home; or he could have the\n              grandparents move into his home. The fifth choice was the\n              choice that he chose, that is, to allow the child to sleep in the\n              same bed every school night, to be there with him most nights\n              as he goes through his get-ready-for-bed ritual . . . . On\n              mornings when he’s not working he’s there to take the child to\n              school.\n                      I do not see any proof that father is not paying attention\n              to this child . . . . I don’t see that Caleb’s life is any different\n              now than it was before, and that’s—until that step is reached we\n              can’t go beyond.\n                      I’m going to dismiss the petition.\n\n        Before turning to the record, and as set out above, Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure\n41.02 mandates that “the court shall find the facts specially and shall state separately its\nconclusion of law.” As set out in context above, the trial court’s “findings” in this case are\nmore conclusions than findings. This Court has previously held that the General Assembly’s\ndecision to require findings of fact and conclusions of law is “not a mere technicality.” In\nre K.H., No. W2008-01144-COA-R3-PT, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1362314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (Tenn.

Without findings of fact, we cannot discern the basis for the trial court’s\ndecision, “and we are unable to afford appropriate deference to the trial court’s decision.”\nIn re Connor S.L., No. W2012-00587-COA-R3-JV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5462839</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. Nov.8, 2012).\n\n        In making a determination of whether there has been a material change in\ncircumstances, we would expect the trial court to consider such questions as whether: “(1)\nthe change occurred after the entry of the order sought to be modified; (2) the changed\ncircumstances were not reasonably anticipated when the underlying decree was entered; and\n(3) the change is one that affects the child’s well-being in a meaningful way.” Cosner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3892024</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *4 (citing Kendrick, 90 S.W.3d at 570). While we recognize that there are\nno “no hard and fast rules for when there has been a change of circumstances sufficient to\njustify a change in custody,” id., we would anticipate that the trial court would synthesize the\nevidence it relied on and discuss it specifically in reaching its factual conclusions. Indeed,\nthe trial on this cause took place over four days and involved several witnesses and exhibits.\nHowever, the trial court failed to cite any evidence from the trial that was used to support its\ndecision. For example, in its statements above, the trial court concludes that: “I do not see\n\fany proof that father is not paying attention to this child . . . . I don’t see that Caleb’s life is\nany different now than it was before.” However, the court does not explain what evidence\nin the record led it to reach these conclusions. In this case, Mother argues that Caleb’s life\nhas changed because he is now spending every school night with his paternal grandparents.\nTo explain the trial court’s conclusion that this fact does not constitute a material change in\ncircumstances, the better practice would have been to note the existing circumstances, and\nthen evaluate the evidence to explain why that evidence did not lead to a conclusion that the\nchild’s circumstances changed. Without some discussion of the facts as they existed at the\ntime custody was vested with Father, this Court is unable to evaluate whether the\ncircumstances have, in fact, changed since that time. Additionally, the court devotes a\nsubstantial portion of its oral ruling to Father’s “four [or five] choices.” However, no\nevidence exists in the record to indicate that Father actually considered any of the “four\nchoices” the trial court outlines. Accordingly, the trial court’s statements are not instructive\nas to whether a material change in circumstances occurred in this case; discussion of the\nactual facts presented by the testimony and exhibits, and how those facts influenced the trial\ncourt’s decision, would have allowed this Court to give the trial court’s decision appropriate\ndeference and to determine where the preponderance of the evidence lies. As previously\ndiscussed, Rule 41.03 requires that the court make its findings “specially,” in these cases.\n“Specially,” denotes a measure of particularity and distinction that can only be accomplished\nby discussion of the evidence that is unique to the case.4 Considering the amount of evidence\nthat was presented in this case (i.e., some 555 pages of transcript, and 15 accompanying\nexhibits), we would anticipate the court’s “findings” to include discussion of the testimony\nand/or exhibits that the trial court relied upon or found particularly significant in reaching its\nconclusions. However, the anticipated findings are simply lacking in this case.\n\n        Generally, the appropriate remedy when a trial court fails to make appropriate findings\nof fact and conclusions of law is to “vacate the trial court’s judgment and remand the cause\nto the trial court for written findings of fact and conclusions of law.” Lake v. Haynes, No.\nW2010-00294-COA-R3-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2361563</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 9, 2011).\nHowever, this Court has indicated that we may “soldier on” with our review despite the trial\ncourt’s failure to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law, in certain limited\ncircumstances:\n\n               On occasion, when a trial judge fails to make findings of fact\n               and conclusions of law, the appellate court “may ‘soldier on’\n\n\n       4\n          The Advisory Commission Comment to Rule 41.02(2) equates the trial court’s requirements\nunder this Rule to those requirements contemplated by Rule 52.01: “The final sentence of Rule 41.02(2)\ndeletes the requirement of a request for written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Instead, in\nconformity with Rule 52.01, findings of fact and conclusions of law are required without request.”\n\n                                                 10\n\f              when the case involves only a clear legal issue, or when the\n              court’s decision is ‘readily ascertainable.’” Hanson v.

However, as noted above, we\ncannot ascertain the trial court’s reasoning from its order, or from the incorporated statements\nfrom the bench, supra. The determination of custody of a child is a very fact specific inquiry,\nand that inquiry is within the purview of the trial court, not the appellate court. See In re\nT.C.D., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1052094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1052094/in-re-tcd/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742 (Tenn.

Our role is to review those specific findings against the record.\nUnfortunately, because we do not know the basis of the court’s decision (i.e., what specific\nevidence the court relied upon in making its determination concerning change of\ncircumstances), we cannot perform our role of reviewing that decision. Accordingly, we\nmust vacate the order of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings,\nincluding, but not limited to, compliance with the mandates of Rule 41.02(2).\n\n       We note, however, that our holding should not be construed as limiting the trial court\nfrom considering additional evidence regarding how the parties’ circumstances have changed\nsince the entry of the trial court’s final order in July of 2013. This Court has previously\nrecognized that the circumstances of children and their parents change over time. See In re\nC.

Ct. App. April 11, 2013). In In re\nC. W., the Tennessee Court of Appeals noted that when a trial court is directed to reconsider\nan issue on remand that involves the circumstances of children and their parents, “the trial\ncourt should endeavor to ascertain and give effect to the parties’ actual circumstances, which\nwill necessarily change over the course of time, e.g., people remarry, have more children,\ninsurance premiums rise and fall, and child care needs change.” Id. Accordingly, the trial\ncourt may, in its discretion, consider such additional evidence to insure that any custody order\nis based on “the parties’ actual circumstances.” Id.\n\n                                       Attorney’s Fees\n\n       In the posture of Appellee, Father appeals the trial court’s denial of his request for\nattorney’s fees incurred at the trial level. Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-5-103(c)\nprovides, in relevant part, that:\n\n                                              11\n\f              The plaintiff spouse may recover from the defendant spouse,\n              and the spouse or other person to whom the custody of the child,\n              or children, is awarded may recover from the other spouse\n              reasonable attorney fees incurred . . . in regard to any suit or\n              action concerning the adjudication of the custody or the change\n              of custody of any child, or children, of the parties, both upon the\n              original divorce hearing and at any subsequent hearing, which\n              fees may be fixed and allowed by the court, before whom such\n              action or proceeding is pending, in the discretion of such court.\n\n        This statute vests discretionary authority in the court to award such fees in custody\ncases.

A trial court abuses its discretion only when it “applies an incorrect legal\nstandard, or reaches a decision which is against logic or reasoning or that causes an injustice\nto the party complaining.” Id. The abuse of discretion standard does not permit the appellate\ncourt to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. Id.\n\n       It is well settled that a trial court speaks through its orders. Palmer v.

App. 1997). In its order June 8, 2011, the trial court simply states\nthat Father’s request for attorney’s fees is denied, and provides no explanation for its\ndecision. Again, the lack of explanation in the court’s order stymies our ability to review the\ncourt’s decision for an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the order\ndenying Father’s attorney’s fees and remand for specific findings concerning the trial court’s\nreasons for the denial of Father’s request.\n\n       In addition, both parties ask this Court to award them their respective attorney’s fees\nand costs incurred in prosecuting and defending this appeal. We glean from Father’s brief\nthat he is seeking these fees on frivolous appeal grounds as his argument is that Mother\nbrought her petition in an effort to revisit the res judicata relocation issues. Tennessee Code\nAnnotated Section 27-1-122 provides:\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f              When it appears to any reviewing court that the appeal from any\n              court of record was frivolous or taken solely for delay, the court\n              may, either upon motion of a party or of its own motion, award\n              just damages against the appellant, which may include but need\n              not be limited to, costs, interest on the judgment, and expenses\n              incurred by the appellee as a result of the appeal.\n\nHowever, “[i]mposing a penalty for a frivolous appeal is a remedy which is to be used only\nin obvious cases of frivolity and should not be asserted lightly or granted unless clearly\napplicable, which is rare.” Henderson v. SAIA, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057608\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057608/henderson-v-saia-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342 (Tenn.2010).\nBecause we are unable to properly review the trial court’s decision in this case, we cannot\nconclude that Mother’s petition was frivolous or brought for any vindictive purpose.\nAccordingly, Father is not entitled to his attorney’s fees for a frivolous appeal. Further, even\nif we assume, arguendo, that the parties are seeking their appellate attorney’s fees based\nupon Tennessee Code Annotated Section 36-5-103(c), supra, given our decision to vacate\nthe judgment of the trial court, we decline to award such attorney’s fees at this time.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the order of the trial court, dismissing Mother’s\npetition and denying Father’s request for attorney’s fees. The case is remanded for such\nfurther proceedings as may be necessary and are consistent with this Opinion. Costs of the\nappeal are assessed one-half against the Appellant/Mother, and her surety, and one-half\nagainst the Appellee/Father, for all of which execution may issue if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    _________________________________\n                                                   J.
