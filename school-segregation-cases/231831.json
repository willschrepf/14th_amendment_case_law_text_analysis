Board of Education of Topeka (347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873), supra.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There then followed the paragraph relating to the bond:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It Is Further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that a bond be filed by plaintiffs herein in the sum of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to be wrongfully enjoined or restrained, said bond to be approved by the Clerk of this Court.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed no bond immediately thereafter or at any time pending the appeal that was timely taken by the defendant school board.  Neither on the appeal nor by motion in the district court did the Board take exception to the failure of the plaintiff to make bond until after this Court published its opinion affirming the injunction order.  Then, for the first time, it filed its motion with the trial court 'to vacate, set aside and to declare the preliminary injunction issued herein on February 15, 1956, to be null and void and without effect on the ground that plaintiffs have failed to file the bond required by the decree of this Court and by the law.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereupon the plaintiffs filed their bond, which was approved on June 19th by the trial judge.  Thereafter, on June 26th, the motion to vacate came on for a hearing and was denied by the trial court.  This appeal is from the order of denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant here contends that Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> requires the making of the bond as a condition precedent to the becoming effective of the temporary injunction, that since none was made 'the preliminary injunction was not in effect or in fact issued during this sixteen months period.'  From this appellant argues that when thereafter the bond was filed this could not cause the injunction to 'issue' for the first time.  No authorities are cited by appellant in support of this assertion.  The School Board relies on cases which hold that a failure of the district court to make provision for the issuance of a bond is void.  See Chatz v. Freeman, 7 Cir., 204 F.2d 764.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellees take the position that the requirement of security by rule 65(c) was intended to protect a party against damage caused by the wrongful issuance of a temporary injunction, citing United States v. Onan, 8 Cir., 190 F.2d 1, 7; that in this case the injunction order has been affirmed on appeal and it obviously therefore was not erroneously issued; thus appellant could not possibly suffer any damage.  They contend that if the failure to file the bond had any effect, it was a mere irregularity which was cured by its subsequent execution.  See Standard Bonded Warehouse Co. v. Cooper, 4 Cir., 30 F.2d 842, 845.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the point is not raised by appellees, who rest confidently on the merits, we must consider the threshold question whether the order of the trial court is reviewable.  Normally, of course, the Courts of Appeals review only final orders.  There is an exception under 28 U.S.C.A. 1292 as to certain interlocutory orders relating to injunctions.  This section provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'(1) Interlocutory orders * * * granting, continuing, modifying, refusing, or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since, obviously, the order which required the making of bond could not be void because of a subsequent failure to make it, the appellant's motion to declare the injunction to be null and void and without effect will be treated as a motion to 'dissolve' the injunction.  As such the order refusing to do so is appealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have heretofore affirmed the order of the trial court.  Thus, no asserted defect in that order can now be considered by us.  All we can consider is what transpired subsequent to the entry of the temporary injunction.  As we have already pointed out, the injunction required no act on the part of the defendants, and in fact it prohibited no specific act in the sense that the defendants could be found in violation of the order without further definitive injunctive order by the court.  The fact that the bond was not executed could not, therefore, conceivably have damaged the defendants.  That this is so is eloquently testified to by the failure of the defendant itself to take notice of the omission.  The affirmance by this Court of the judgment before defendants sought to have it vacated has settled for all time that defendants have not been, and can never be, 'wrongfully enjoined' by the order.  The bond was functus officio when made by the plaintiffs.  Their failure to make it earlier, when it might have had an office to perform, was waived by the defendant when it let the order stand against it until affirmed on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Orleans Parish School Board v.
