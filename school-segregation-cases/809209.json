Gen., Atlanta, Ga., for defendants-appellees.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before RONEY, Chief Judge, GODBOLD, TJOFLAT, HILL, FAY, VANCE, KRAVITCH, JOHNSON, HATCHETT, ANDERSON, and CLARK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HATCHETT, Circuit Judge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We took this case en banc to determine whether and under what circumstances, if any, a child involuntarily placed in a foster home may successfully bring an action in federal court against the state officials involved in the placement, for injuries sustained while in the foster home.  Finding that a child may successfully bring such an action, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982, pursuant to an order of the Gwinnett County Juvenile Court, the child who was the plaintiff in the district court, and who is the appellant here, was taken from the custody of her natural parents and placed with the Gwinnett County Department of Family and Children Services (DFACS).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>   Upon removing the child from the custody of her natural parents, officials and employees of the Georgia Department of Human Resources and DFACS assumed responsibility for the child's custody, supervision, and care.  During 1982, the DHR and DFACS officials placed the child in a foster home.  While in the foster home the child suffered severe and permanent personal injuries as a result of being \"willfully struck, shaken, thrown down, beaten and otherwise severely abused by the foster mother.\"    She remains in a coma as a result of those injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This suit was filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 by the child, through her guardian, against the state and county officials involved in her placement in the foster home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   The child alleges that the state and county officials were grossly negligent and deliberately indifferent to her welfare when deciding to place her, and after placing her, in the foster home.  Specifically, she alleges that the officials:  (1) failed to thoroughly investigate the fitness of the foster home;  (2) knew or should have known the foster parents were unfit to be trusted with her care, custody, and supervision;  (3) failed to maintain proper supervision in inspection of the foster home;  and (4) failed to obtain complete physical and medical records, or to furnish available records to the foster parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The child's complaint states two claims:  first, the officials were deliberately indifferent to her rights and, therefore, they are liable under the reasoning employed in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), and in Doe v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.1981), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 864, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983).  The second claim is that the Georgia statutory foster care scheme creates a legitimate claim of entitlement enforceable in federal court under the holding in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   This court affirmed.   Taylor v. Ledbetter, 791 F.2d 881 (11th Cir.1986).  The full court took the case en banc to determine the Roth and Estelle issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state and county officials contend that the child's suit was properly dismissed for four reasons:  First, they contend that the child's claim is barred by the recent decisions of the Supreme Court in Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986), and in Davidson v. Cannon, 474 U.S. 344, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986).  Second, they contend that the Georgia statutory scheme for child placement and supervision does not create any entitlements to children placed in foster homes.  Their third contention is that the allegations in the child's complaint are conclusory, and if not conclusory, are not sufficient to support a due process claim;  and their fourth claim is that because the Gwinnett County Juvenile Court made the decision to remove the child from the natural parents they cannot be liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first contention is easily decided.  In Daniels and Davidson, the Supreme Court held that the due process clause is not implicated by the negligent act of an official causing unintended loss or injury to life, liberty, or property.  The complaint in this case, however, alleges, in each paragraph, that the officials were \"grossly negligent\" or \"deliberately indifferent.\"    Thus, the complaint is sufficient to overcome either a Daniels or Davidson bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can also easily dispose of the state officials' fourth contention that the action of the Gwinnett County Juvenile Court insulates them from liability.  The Gwinnett County Juvenile Court's removal of the child from her natural parents is irrelevant at this point in the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having decided two of the four contentions above, we proceed to a discussion of the Estelle (substantive constitutional claim) and the Roth claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Substantive Constitutional Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that the allegations in the complaint must be taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the child. Scheuer v. Rhodes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> 416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974);  Miller v. Stanmore, 636 F.2d 986 (5th Cir.1981);  Johnson v. Wells, 566 F.2d 1016 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Section 1983</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first the requirements for an action filed under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.  For a section 1983 action to arise where an official is charged with failing to exercise an affirmative duty, two requirements must be satisfied.  First, the failure to act must have been a substantial factor leading to the violation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.   Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976).  Second, the official having the responsibility to act must display deliberate indifference.   Turpin v. Mailet, 619 F.2d 196 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1016, 101 S.Ct. 577, 66 L.Ed.2d 475 (1980).  These two requirements have been adequately pleaded in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Liberty Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liberty interest which the child asserts under the fourteenth amendment is a substantive due process right rather than a procedural due process right.  In a substantive due process claim, we are concerned with those rights which the state may not take away.  Substantive due process rights are rights such as those listed in the Bill of Rights and those rights held to be so fundamental that a state may not take them away.  Among the fundamental rights not listed in the Bill of Rights or incorporated through the fourteenth amendment are such rights as abortion (Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973));  privacy (Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 97 S.Ct. 869, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977);  marriage (Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 98 S.Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978));  and safety and physical movement (Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, procedural due process claims involve those expectations created by state law.  As to these rights, the state may take them away by affording predeprivation hearings as in Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632, 94 S.Ct. 791, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974) (public employment);  or by a post-deprivation hearing as in Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981) (hobby kit), or by providing other safeguards.    Parratt only applies to procedural due process claims;  consequently, Parratt is not a bar to this action brought under section 1983 based on the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liberty interests in this case are the right to be free from the infliction of unnecessary pain, as that interest is protected by the fifth and fourteenth amendments, and the fundamental right to physical safety as protected by the fourteenth amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court recognized a liberty interest in a person involuntarily committed to a custodial setting in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982).  In Youngberg, the mother of a mentally retarded person involuntarily committed to a Pennsylvania state institution upon her petition filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 seeking damages against the institution's officials.  The mother alleged that the officials knew or should have known that her son was suffering injuries, but failed to take appropriate preventive procedures, thereby violating his rights under the eighth and fourteenth amendments.  The Supreme Court recognized the child's liberty interest in the safety of his environment and noted that the right to personal security constitutes a \"historic liberty interest\" protected substantively by the due process clause.   Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. at 315, 102 S.Ct. at 2458, 73 L.Ed.2d at 37 (citing Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 673, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 1413, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liberty interest in this case is analogous to the liberty interest in Youngberg.    In both cases, the state involuntarily placed the person in a custodial environment, and in both cases, the person is unable to seek alternative living arrangements.  In Youngberg the Court said, \"if it is cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions, it must be unconstitutional to confine the involuntarily committed--who may not be punished at all--in unsafe conditions.\"   Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16, 102 S.Ct. at 2458, 73 L.Ed.2d at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A child confined to a state mental health facility has a fourteenth amendment substantive due process liberty interest in reasonably safe living conditions.   Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 320, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2460, 73 L.Ed.2d 28, 39 (1982).  Similarly, if foster parents with whom the state places a child injure the child, and that injury results from state action or inaction, a balancing of interests may show a deprivation of liberty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State action was clearly involved in Youngberg where the person was confined to a state mental facility.  In this case, the child's physical safety was a primary objective in placing the child in the foster home.  The state's action in assuming the responsibility of finding and keeping the child in a safe environment placed an obligation on the state to insure the continuing safety of that environment.  The state's failure to meet that obligation, as evidenced by the child's injuries, in the absence of overriding societal interests, constituted a deprivation of liberty under the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful that a liberty interest protected by the due process clause involves a balancing.  \"In determining whether a substantive right protected by the due process clause has been violated, it is necessary to balance 'the liberty of the individual' and 'the demands of an organized society.' \"   Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 320, 102 S.Ct. at 2460, 73 L.Ed.2d at 40.  By alleging that the gross negligence and deliberate indifference of state officials rendered her comatose, the child has sufficiently pleaded a liberty interest.  The state of Georgia may assert societal reasons for failing to take the actions alleged as necessary in the child's complaint and held mandatory by the Georgia statutory scheme.  Whether the child's claim constitutes a liberty interest protected by the due process clause when weighed against the demands of society will be determined at later stages in these proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Deliberate Indifference</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), the Supreme Court held that prison officials who show deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious illness or injury violate the eighth amendment's prohibition against the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.  Such a transgression gives rise to a prisoner's action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.  This principle is well established in this circuit.   Williams v. Bennett, 689 F.2d 1370 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit has held that a minor in state custody may maintain a section 1983 action based on the fourteenth amendment under an Estelle analysis.   Doe v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.1981), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 864, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983).  The Doe court held that where a state official's deliberate indifference is a substantial factor in denying property or liberty interests, a child in foster care is in a situation analogous to a prisoner in state custody.  Consequently, state officials responsible for foster placement may be liable under section 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts in Doe are similar to those in this case.  In Doe, a foster child sued her legal custodian and a voluntary child welfare agency which provided foster care under a contract with the city of New York.  In the suit, the foster child alleged that state officials violated her constitutional rights when, with the knowledge of possible sexual abuse from her foster father, they failed to investigate or remove her from the foster home.  The Second Circuit held that government officials may be liable under section 1983 not only for overt activity which is unlawful and harmful, but also for failure to act when the duty to act exists.  \"When individuals are placed in custody or under the care of the government, their governmental custodians are sometimes charged with affirmative duties, the nonfeasance of which may violate the Constitution.  Thus, nonperformance of such custodial duties has been held to give rise to a section 1983 cause of action for prisoners.\"   Doe, 649 F.2d at 141.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Is a foster child involuntarily placed in a foster home in a situation so similar to that of a prisoner involuntarily placed in an institution that similar rules of law should be applied?    We believe so.  We recognize that the situations are not parallel.  Obviously, a closer relationship exists between superior officers, subordinate officers, and the inmates within a prison than exists between a state agency, the foster parents, and the foster child in a foster care setting.  In a penal institution, all the persons involved are in close and daily contact.  Wardens and supervisors have the ability to daily monitor the activities of subordinates as well as the effect of certain conduct upon inmates.  Although the contacts between actors in the foster home situation are not as close as in the penal institution the situations are close enough to be held analogous.  The lack of proximity in the foster home situation simply suggests that deliberate indifference is not as easily inferred or shown from a failure to act.  A child abused while in foster care, in order to successfully recover from state officials in a section 1983 action, will be faced with the difficult problem of showing actual knowledge of abuse or that agency personnel deliberately failed to learn what was occurring in the foster home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although mindful of the fact that the eighth amendment has historically been limited to criminal proceedings, such substantial similarities exist between a prisoner's situation and the situation of a minor child forced into a foster home that we are justified in holding that the situations are sufficiently analogous to support a section 1983 action.   Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977) is not a bar to this holding.  In finding that imposing corporal punishment upon school children in public schools does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, the Supreme Court relied heavily upon the support which a school child receives from family, friends, teachers, and other pupils who may witness and protest mistreatment.  The Court acknowledged, in its well-known footnote, that some circumstances may be sufficiently analogous to criminal processes as to justify application of the eighth amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>   The Court expressly left open the question of whether and under what circumstances persons involuntarily confined in juvenile institutions may claim eighth amendment protection.  In Ingraham, the Court discussed the cost of providing additional benefits and safeguards to school children threatened with punishment.  It found the cost of benefits and additional safeguards high and the risk of harm to the school children low.  In the foster home setting, recent events lead us to believe that the risk of harm to children is high.  We believe the risk of harm is great enough to bring foster children under the umbrella of protection afforded by the fourteenth amendment.  Children in foster homes, unlike children in public schools, are isolated;  no persons outside the home setting are present to witness and report mistreatment.  The children are helpless.  Without the investigation, supervision, and constant contact required by statute, a child placed in a foster home is at the mercy of the foster parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourteenth amendment, like the eighth amendment, \"must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\"   Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958).  With contemporary society's outrage at the exposure of defenseless children to gross mistreatment and abuse, it is time that the law give to these defenseless children at least the same protection afforded adults who are imprisoned as a result of their own misdeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Second Circuit:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>Defendants may be held liable under 1983 if they, or in the case of an agency, its top supervisory personnel, exhibited deliberate indifference to a known injury, a known risk, or a specific duty and their failure to perform the duty or act to ameliorate the risk of injury was a proximate cause of plaintiff's deprivation of rights under the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">649 F.2d at 145.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that a child involuntarily placed in a foster home is in a situation so analogous to a prisoner in a penal institution and a child confined in a mental health facility that the foster child may bring a section 1983 action for violation of fourteenth amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding does not mean that every child in foster care may prevail in a section 1983 action against state officials based on incidental injuries or infrequent acts of abuse;  only where it is alleged and the proof shows that the state officials were deliberately indifferent to the welfare of the child will liability be imposed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Special Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not alone in our holding.  Other circuits have recognized that special relationships may support section 1983 actions.  In Bowers v. DeVito, 686 F.2d 616 (7th Cir.1982), the Seventh Circuit refused to hold the state liable for a murder committed by a schizophrenic (with a history of criminal violence) one year after being released from a state mental hospital.  The court in Bowers stated that \"there is no constitutional right to be protected by the state against being murdered by criminals or madmen.\"   Bowers, 686 F.2d at 618.  However, the Bowers court held that an affirmative duty obligating the state to protect private citizens' safety and health could arise from special custodial or other relationships--where the state is responsible for placing such person in a \"position of danger\" or potential harm.  The court in Bowers stated:  \"If the state puts a man in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him, it will not be heard to say that its role was merely passive;  it is as much an active tort feasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.  It is on this theory that state prison personnel are sometimes held liable under section 1983 for the violence of one prison inmate against another.\"   Bowers, 686 F.2d at 618.  The Bowers court refused to distinguish between custodial relationships and \"other relationships created by the state.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Circuit in Fox v. Custis, 712 F.2d 84, 86 (4th Cir.1983), defined the category of persons entitled to institute a section 1983 claim against the state.  The Fox court expressly stated the nexus between the state and a private citizen necessary to an action under section 1983:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With one qualification, we agree with the Seventh Circuit's recent holding that, in general, there simply is 'no constitutional right to be protected by the state against ... criminals or madmen,' and that because, in corollary, there is no 'constitutional duty [on the state] to provide such protection, its failure to do so is not actionable under section 1983.'   Bowers v. DeVito, 686 F.2d 616, 618 (7th Cir.1982).  The qualification--an important one actually acknowledged by the Bowers court, Id. --is that such a right and corollary duty may arise out of special custodial or other relationships created or assumed by the state in respect of particular persons.  [Original emphasis.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fox, 712 F.2d at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liberty interest which the plaintiff alleges is also sufficiently borne out by our decision in Dollar v. Harralson County, 704 F.2d 1540 (11th Cir.1983).  In Dollar, we stated:  \"In determining whether a constitutional deprivation has occurred, courts must examine whether the defendant was under any obligation to the particular plaintiff.  The question of the existence of such a duty is an issue of law.\"    704 F.2d at 1543.  We went on to note that the existence of duties resulting from relationships is usually clear in section 1983 cases, citing the relationship between prisoners and wardens and hospitals and patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dollar suggests that the more important the relationship and its attendant duties, the more likely it is that an act or omission on the part of one party has the potential to deprive the other of a constitutional right.  The relationship between state officials charged with carrying out a foster child care program and the children in the program is an important one involving substantial duties and, therefore, substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has also recognized the \"special relationship\" analysis.   Jones v. Phyfer, 761 F.2d 642 (11th Cir.1985).  The Jones court, in noting that \"[t]here are cases which demonstrate the type of special relationship required for an action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983,\" stated:  \"the case workers were hired specifically to protect the children and ... it would therefore be unreasonable to characterize the child's death as too remote a consequence of the case workers' failure to perform their duties.\"   Jones, 761 F.2d at 645.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Roth Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The child also contends that the statutes and regulations of the state of Georgia create in her a legitimate and sufficiently vested claim of entitlement such that deprivation of that entitlement without due process of law imposes on her a grievous loss.  This claim is based on the Supreme Court's holding in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).  In Roth, the Court held that procedural due process applies to the deprivation of interests encompassed within the fourteenth amendment's protection of liberty and property when a person has acquired specific benefits through state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must look to the Georgia statutes and ordinances to determine whether they indicate an intention to bestow benefits upon children in the care of the state or upon children placed by the state in foster homes.  An appendix is attached setting forth the statutes and ordinances involved in this case.  The district court's order provides an excellent summary of the pertinent Georgia statutes and ordinances:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>The Georgia statute in question provides generally that the Department of Human Resources is authorized to use its facilities for the assistance of children in several ways, including child welfare services, preventive services, services to courts, and regulation of child placing and child caring agencies.  See O.C.G.A. Sec. 49-5-8.  Moreover, O.C.G.A. Sec. 49-5-9(b) requires that institutions and agencies which have custody of children who are committed to the Department shall be inspected by the Department.  The regulations governing foster care services which are those most directly applicable to the present case are found at O.C.G.R.R.G. Sec. 290-2-12-.08.  These regulations require the development of a plan for a child placed in foster care which is responsive to the child's needs, is attentive to the duration of the placement, projects necessary medical services, and sets goals toward enabling the child to be replaced with his natural family.  Subsection (3) of that section provides that the selection of a foster home should be based upon an assessment of the child's total needs and how well a particular program can meet the child's needs.  Subsection (13) provides that the agency shall evaluate each foster home including:  motives;  adjustment of the foster family to each other and the community;  foster family's attitude toward the parents of the foster child;  the family's expectations of behavior of foster children;  physical standards;  community resources;  the physical, mental, and emotional health of each member of the foster family;  foster parent training;  and adequacy of financial resources.  Subsection (16) provides that supervision of children in foster homes is to be maintained by the agency 'through visits made at regular intervals and as frequently as is necessary for the best interest of the child.'    The section continues that there must be at least one personal contact each month.    Subsection (19) of the foster child regulations provides that the agency shall maintain a file for each foster child which includes, inter alia, the child's medical history and a health record.  [Emphasis added.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of the comprehensive and direct nature of the statutory commands, the district court concluded that the statutes and ordinances only provided \"procedural guidelines\" to be followed in arriving at decisions.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Georgia statutes provide more than just \"procedural guidelines\" to be followed in arriving at decisions.  The Georgia foster care and placement scheme is a comprehensive one.  The Children and Youth Act provides that \"legal custody embodies:  '(B) the right and the duty to protect [children] ... and (C) the responsibility to provide food, clothing, shelter, education, and ordinary medical care.' \"    O.C.G.A. Sec. 49-5-3(12).  The law governing the licensing of child placement agencies clearly mandates that the Department of Human Resources \"in placing children in foster family homes, shall safeguard the welfare of such children by thoroughly investigating each such home and the character and reputation of the persons residing therein and shall adequately supervise each home during the period of care.\"    \"... It shall be the duty of the department to inspect at regular intervals all licensed child welfare agencies within the state including ... foster family homes....\"  O.C.G.A. Sec. 49-5-12(l), (m).  The regulations governing foster care services are found in O.C.R.R.G. Sec. 290-2-12-08.  Subsection 3 of that section provides that the selection of a foster home should be based upon an assessment of the child's total needs and how well a particular program meets the child's needs.  Section 16 provides that supervision of children in foster homes is to be maintained \"through visits made at regular intervals and as frequently as necessary for the best interest of the child.\"    (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the Georgia scheme mandates that officials follow guidelines and take affirmative actions to ensure the well being and promote the welfare of children in foster care.  These children can state a claim based upon deprivation of a liberty interest in personal safety when the officials fail to follow this mandate.  \"In a constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of 'liberty' must be broad indeed.\"   Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 572, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2707, 33 L.Ed.2d 548, 558 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is of no moment that the state officials are not charged in this case with affirmatively acting to harm this child.  What the child is entitled to is the state's protection from harm.  She is entitled to be protected in the manner provided by statute.  It would be anomalous if the state, in allegedly acting to protect the child, could itself cause harm to the child by failing to assume the child's minimal physical safety.  Failing to act may, under certain circumstances, be more detrimental than acting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the Georgia child care statutory scheme gives rise to a Roth -type claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the child's claim under Roth is a procedural due process claim, the state of Georgia may alter its statutes and ordinances in such a way as to change or eliminate the expectation on which this child had the right to rely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons expressed by the district court, we find without merit plaintiff's claim in Count III of the complaint based upon the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 601 and its regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of Count III of the complaint.

The majority bases its conclusion on two theories of liability.  First, purporting to follow Doe v. New York City Dep't of Social Servs., 649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.1981), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 864, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983), the majority holds that the officials can be held liable on the theory that they were \"deliberately indifferent\" to the duties of their offices.  Assuming the validity of the principle Doe articulated--that an official may be held liable under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (1982) for permitting a child to remain in a foster home while knowing that the child will be exposed to a substantial risk of child abuse or knowing facts that would lead any reasonable person to recognize that risk--the facts of this case neither resemble those in Doe nor satisfy the standard Doe enunciated.  Moreover, the majority's holding cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court's decision in Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 100 S.Ct. 553, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980), a decision that both Doe and the majority fail to address.  I therefore dissent from the majority's holding on the Doe claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p237\">\n      <span class=\"num\">237</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority today also holds that the Georgia foster care scheme gave the foster child in this case a \"legitimate claim of entitlement,\" under Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), thus creating a procedural due process claim for the injury she sustained at the hands of her foster parents.  I disagree with this conclusion and accordingly dissent from the majority's holding on the Roth claim.  I concur in the majority's disposition of count III of the complaint, upholding the panel's decision that count III failed to state a claim for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p238\">\n      <span class=\"num\">238</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case, as stated in the complaint, are crucial to our consideration of this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>   Kathy Jo Taylor, the plaintiff, was born on February 3, 1980.  On April 28, 1982, the plaintiff was removed from the custody of her natural parents by order of the Gwinnett County, Georgia, Juvenile Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>   That court placed her in the temporary custody of the Gwinnett County Department of Family and Children's Services (DFACS), a division of the Georgia Department of Human Resources (DHR).  In August 1982, DFACS placed the plaintiff in a foster home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>   According to the complaint, the foster parents, Roy Michael Lathren and Linda Price Lathren, \"were legally and morally unfit to be entrusted with the custody, supervision, and care of the Plaintiff and such fact was known to the Defendants or should have been known to them in the exercise of even slight care.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p239\">\n      <span class=\"num\">239</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1982, the plaintiff suffered serious physical injuries and eventually lapsed into a coma from which she has yet to recover.  The circumstances surrounding this tragedy are uncertain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>   The complaint alleges that the plaintiff, \"on or about October 13, 1982, was wantonly and willfully struck, shaken, thrown down, beaten, and otherwise severely abused by the foster mother.\"    Further, the complaint alleges that \"[t]he foster parents wantonly and willfully failed to seek emergency medical treatment for the Plaintiff until October 17, 1982, when she suffered seizures and lapsed into a coma.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p240\">\n      <span class=\"num\">240</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff, through her guardian ad litem, brought suit in the district court under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (1982).  The complaint named several defendants:  James G. Ledbetter, Ph.D., Commissioner of the DHR;  Patricia Johnson, Ph.D., Director of the DHR's Division of Family and Children's Services;  Frederick B. Webb, Director of DFACS;  Sonyonna Stone Danielle, supervisor of placement services for DFACS;  and Jo Ann Hoover and W.R. Berry, DFACS caseworkers.  The complaint consisted of three counts, two of which are relevant here.  Count I alleged that the defendants, in violation of the fourteenth amendment, deprived the plaintiff of liberty without due process of law by denying her entitlements (an adequate preplacement investigation, and subsequent supervision of her custody in her foster home) that the Georgia foster care scheme granted her.  In count II, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated the substantive guarantees of the eighth and fourteenth amendments because, with deliberate indifference, they failed to discharge their duty to inspect the Lathren home before placing the plaintiff there and they failed to supervise the Lathrens' care of the child.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p241\">\n      <span class=\"num\">241</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the district court dismissed, without leave to amend,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> all counts of the plaintiff's complaint.  The plaintiff then appealed.  A divided panel of this court affirmed, finding that (1) the plaintiff's factual allegations in count II were insufficient to state a \"deliberate indifference\" substantive due process claim under Doe v. New York City Dep't of Social Servs., 649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.1981), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 864, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983), because the complaint did not allege that the defendants had knowledge of a risk of physical abuse to the child and that they acted or failed to act in deliberate indifference to that risk, and (2) as to count I, the Georgia foster care scheme does not create the alleged \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" under Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), because it creates procedural guidelines, not specific rights or entitlements.  We took this case en banc to determine whether either of these counts of the complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted.  For convenience of analysis, I will address the count II claim first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p242\">\n      <span class=\"num\">242</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's count II claim is that each of the defendants deprived her of substantive rights, secured by the eighth amendment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, to be free from physical abuse at the hands of her foster parents.  In analyzing this claim, it is important to note that the plaintiff does not contend that any of the defendants personally participated in the infliction of her injuries.   Cf. Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 285 &amp; n. 10, 100 S.Ct. 553, 559 &amp; n. 10, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p243\">\n      <span class=\"num\">243</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff relies on the Second Circuit's opinion in Doe v. New York City Dep't of Social Servs., 649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.1981), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 864, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983), to support her claim that she was deprived of substantive constitutional rights.  In essence, the Doe court held that the Supreme Court, given its reasoning in the eighth amendment case of Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), would recognize as a fundamental constitutional right the right of a foster child to be free of physical abuse caused by the deliberate indifference of state welfare officials responsible for the child's supervision.  In Estelle, the Supreme Court, observing that a state has an obligation to provide its prison inmates necessary medical care, held that the \"deliberate indifference\" of state prison personnel to an inmate's serious illness or injury constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, giving rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a>   As the Court stated, \"[t]his is true whether the indifference is manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.\"   Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05, 97 S.Ct. at 291 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p244\">\n      <span class=\"num\">244</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seventh Circuit applied the Estelle rationale in a case in which a mental patient murdered a woman after being discharged from a state psychiatric hospital.   Bowers v. DeVito, 686 F.2d 616 (7th Cir.1982).  Her personal representative sought to hold the hospital officials who were responsible for the discharge liable in damages because they allegedly released the patient with reckless disregard for the public's safety.   Id. at 617.  The court upheld the district court's judgment summarily dismissing the plaintiff's claim on the merits, but acknowledged that a constitutional claim for reckless indifference could lie, under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, depending on the facts of the particular case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p245\">\n      <span class=\"num\">245</span>\n      <p>If the state puts a man in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him, it will not be heard to say that its role was merely passive;  it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.

Williams, 474 U.S. 327, ---, 106 S.Ct. 662, 666, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (quoting Paul v.

In Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 100 S.Ct. 553, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980), the personal representative of a girl, murdered by a mentally disturbed sex offender while he was on parole, attempted to obtain money damages under section 1983 against the state officials who were responsible for paroling the offender.  The personal representative alleged that the officials deprived the decedent of procedural due process of law under the fourteenth amendment because they released the offender knowing that he would probably commit a violent crime, such as the murder at issue.    Id. at 279-81, 100 S.Ct. at 556-57.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a>   (As I discuss in Part II.B. infra, the complaint in the instant case, in contrast, does not allege that any defendant knew that the plaintiff would be exposed to a substantial risk of physical abuse in the Lathren foster home.)    A unanimous Supreme Court rejected the personal representative's section 1983 claim, holding that the allegations of his complaint failed to state a claim of constitutional magnitude, as distinguished from a claim under state tort law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p249\">\n      <span class=\"num\">249</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the decision to release [the offender] from prison was action by the State, the action of [the offender] five months later cannot be fairly characterized as state action.  Regardless of whether, as a matter of state tort law, the parole board could be said either to have had a \"duty\" to avoid harm to his victim or to have proximately caused her death, we hold that, taking these particular allegations as true, [the parole officials] did not \"deprive\" [the] decedent of life within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p250\">\n      <span class=\"num\">250</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The decedent's] life was taken by the [offender] five months after his release.

We need not and do not decide that a parole officer could never be deemed to \"deprive\" someone of life by action taken in connection with the release of a prisoner on parole.  But we do hold that at least under the particular circumstances of this parole decision, [the] decedent's death is too remote a consequence of the parole officers' action to hold them responsible under the federal civil rights law.  Although a Sec. 1983 claim has been described as \"a species of tort liability,\" it is perfectly clear that not every injury in which a state official has played some part is actionable under that statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p251\">\n      <span class=\"num\">251</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 284-85, 100 S.Ct. at 559 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis added);  see also Bowers, 686 F.2d at 617-19 (state mental hospital not liable under section 1983 for releasing a mental patient who subsequently murdered a woman, because the officials had not knowingly placed the victim, a member of the general public, in a position of danger).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixteen months after the Supreme Court handed down its Martinez decision, the Second Circuit decided Doe.    That case involved a section 1983 claim by a foster child against a child-placement agency licensed by the City of New York.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a>   She alleged that her foster father had sexually abused her for a number of years, that the agency had knowledge of facts placing it on notice of that abuse, and that the agency ignored these facts and had done nothing to alleviate the situation.  The agency's conduct, she alleged, amounted to deliberate indifference to her safety in the foster home and thus deprived her of a liberty interest without due process of law, in violation of the fourteenth amendment.   Doe, 649 F.2d at 137-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p253\">\n      <span class=\"num\">253</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doe was tried by a jury, which exonerated the child placement agency.  The plaintiff appealed, seeking a new trial on the ground that the district court's jury instruction on the doctrine of deliberate indifference imposed on her a greater burden of proof than that doctrine mandated.  The court of appeals agreed and remanded the case for a new trial.   Id. at 141.  In its opinion, the court recognized a point that we should bear in mind in deciding this case:  a foster child seeking damages against a child placement agency or its officials for child abuse inflicted by a foster parent faces a heavier burden in establishing deliberate indifference than does a prison inmate seeking damages against prison officials for cruel and unusual punishment.  For example, unlike the prison situation, there is no strong chain of command in the placement and supervision of children in foster care:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a closer and firmer line of authority running from superiors and subordinates within [a penal] institution than exists in the foster care context, particularly in respect of the relationship between agency personnel and the foster parent.  [Prison] administrators can readily call in subordinates for consultation.  They can give strict orders with reasonable assurance that their mandates will be followed, and as added insurance other employees stationed in proximity of the subordinates to whom orders are directed may be instructed to monitor compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the [foster care agency] ha[s] to rely upon occasional visits for its information gathering, and its relationship to the foster family [is] less unequivocally hierarchical than is the case with prison guards and a warden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 142.  Moreover, to give the child a normal family environment, foster care officials understandably feel \"constrained to respect the foster family's autonomy and integrity[,] and [feel] pressured to minimize intrusiveness.\"    Id.  Prison officials, on the other hand, feel no such constraint or pressure;  their role is to monitor and control an inmate's environment and activities on a day-to-day basis.  Consequently, prison officials will normally have more information available to them about the conditions of an inmate's confinement than officials overseeing foster care will have about the conditions of a foster home placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deliberate indifference standard of fault--used by the Supreme Court in Estelle and, purportedly, by the majority today--is analogous to reckless disregard of safety, which is well defined in tort law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p>The actor's conduct is in reckless disregard of the safety of another if he does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 500 (1965) (hereinafter Restatement );  see also Doe, 649 F.2d 143-44 &amp; nn. 4-5.  Recklessness, like deliberate indifference, is a higher standard of fault than mere negligence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p260\">\n      <span class=\"num\">260</span>\n      <p>Reckless misconduct differs from negligence in several important particulars.  It differs from that form of negligence which consists in mere inadvertence, incompetence, unskillfulness, or a failure to take precautions to enable the actor adequately to cope with a possible or probable future emergency, in that reckless misconduct requires a conscious choice of a course of action, either with knowledge of the serious danger to others involved in it or with knowledge of facts which would disclose this danger to any reasonable man.    It differs not only from the above-mentioned form of negligence, but also from that negligence which consists in intentionally doing an act with knowledge that it contains a risk of harm to others, in that the actor to be reckless must recognize that his conduct involves a risk substantially greater in amount than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.  The difference between reckless misconduct and conduct involving only such a quantum of risk as is necessary to make it negligent is a difference in the degree of the risk, but this difference of degree is so marked as to amount substantially to a difference in kind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p261\">\n      <span class=\"num\">261</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement, supra, Sec. 500 comment g (emphasis added);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  see also Doe, 649 F.2d 143-44 &amp; n. 5.  Thus, to establish deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendants either had actual knowledge of a substantial risk or had knowledge of facts that would indicate this risk to any reasonable person.   See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-06, 97 S.Ct. at 291-92;  Doe, 649 F.2d at 141.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p262\">\n      <span class=\"num\">262</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, it is more difficult for a foster child, who has suffered physical abuse at the hands of his or her foster parents, to prove that the abuse flowed from the deliberate indifference of the child placement official than it is for a prison inmate to satisfy that standard in an eighth amendment case.  This difference is a function of the notice requirement of the deliberate indifference standard.  As the Second Circuit noted in Doe, in the relationship between foster care officials and foster parents, the officials will inherently have less information about the foster care setting--and thus less knowledge of potential danger to the foster child--than their prison official counterparts will have concerning the inmates in their charge.  With these observations and the Restatement principles in mind, I shall assess the sufficiency of the plaintiff's allegations in count II of her complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p263\">\n      <span class=\"num\">263</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I first assess the plaintiff's allegations against W.R. Berry, the caseworker whom DFACS assigned to handle the plaintiff's case, because he is the defendant most likely to have known that the plaintiff faced a substantial danger of child abuse in the Lathren home or to have had knowledge of facts that would have led a reasonable person to conclude that the plaintiff faced such a danger.  The plaintiff alleged that (1) Berry had the duty to investigate the Lathren home and to supervise it while the plaintiff lived there and (2) Berry failed \"to make a thorough and complete investigation and study\" of that home.  These allegations do not even state a claim of negligence, because they do not disclose whether Berry would have discovered, in the exercise of due care, that the plaintiff faced a risk of child abuse if placed in the Lathren home.  Nonetheless, granting the plaintiff's complaint the most liberal reading, I proceed on the assumption that the complaint alleges that Berry would have discovered this risk and therefore that it states a cause of action for simple negligence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p264\">\n      <span class=\"num\">264</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state a claim of deliberate indifference, however, the plaintiff had to allege additional facts:  that Berry either had actual knowledge that the plaintiff faced a substantial risk of child abuse in the Lathren home or had knowledge of facts that would have caused a reasonable person to conclude that the child faced this risk.  The plaintiff alleged no such additional facts.  It is true that she alleged that Berry acted with deliberate indifference in failing to carry out his investigative and supervisory duties, a mere conclusion of ultimate fact.  The plaintiff did not, however, take the requisite further step and allege that Berry acted with deliberate indifference toward a known danger of the child abuse she eventually suffered.  The plaintiff did assert that the Lathrens \"were legally and morally unfit\" to be foster parents (which I will assume means that the Lathrens would likely abuse the plaintiff), but she did not also allege that Berry--or, for that matter, any of the other defendants--knew this fact.  When the allegations in a complaint are vague and conclusory, \"and fail to set forth facts which, if proved, would warrant the relief sought, it is proper to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\"   Davidson v. State of Georgia, 622 F.2d 895, 897 (5th Cir.1980) (per curiam) (citations omitted);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  see also Fullman v. Graddick, 739 F.2d 553, 556-57 (11th Cir.1984) (\"In civil rights actions, it has been held that a complaint will be dismissed as insufficient where the allegations it contains are vague and conclusory.\")  (citations omitted).  Thus, the plaintiff failed to state a claim for relief against Berry in count II of her complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p265\">\n      <span class=\"num\">265</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is buttressed by the Supreme Court's rationale and holding in Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 100 S.Ct. 553, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980).  There, the Court concluded that parole officials could not be held liable under section 1983 even though they released a known sex offender who was likely to commit a violent crime and even though the murder of the victim was foreseeable.   Id. at 278, 100 S.Ct. at 556.  In the instant case, the officials had no knowledge that the Lathrens had any propensity for child abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p266\">\n      <span class=\"num\">266</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Seventh Circuit's Bowers decision supports my conclusion.  As the court noted in Bowers, \"[i]f the state puts a man in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him, it will not be heard to say that its role was merely passive;  it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.\"   Bowers v. DeVito, 686 F.2d 616, 618 (7th Cir.1982).  There is no allegation in this case that the Lathren foster home was the equivalent of a snake pit and that the defendants knew this fact or had knowledge of facts that would have led a reasonable person to recognize it as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p267\">\n      <span class=\"num\">267</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's allegations against the remaining defendants suffer from the same deficiency described above.  The allegations do not set forth facts indicating what, if anything, these defendants knew about the danger of physical abuse the plaintiff faced if DFACS placed her, or permitted her to remain, in the Lathren home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>   All the plaintiff alleged was the conclusion that these defendants<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> were deliberately indifferent in carrying out their duties to ensure that the caseworker, Berry, did his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p268\">\n      <span class=\"num\">268</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's upholding of count II of the complaint against defendants Ledbetter and Johnson, the DHR officials in the state capital, is particularly disturbing in light of those defendants' complete separation from the events that brought about the plaintiff's injury.  This court should bear in mind that section 1983 liability cannot be based on vicarious liability or respondeat superior.   See Monell v. Department of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (\"[W]e conclude that a municipality cannot be held liable solely because it employs a tortfeasor--or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under Sec. 1983 on a respondeat superior theory.\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>   Coffy v. Multi-County Narcotics Bureau, 600 F.2d 570, 580 (6th Cir.1979) (\"Liability under Sec. 1983 may not be imposed upon an official simply on the basis of respondeat superior.\")  (citation omitted).  Rather, the plaintiff must allege and prove that each official actively participated in, encouraged, or directed the alleged deprivation.   Ford v. Byrd, 544 F.2d 194, 195 (5th Cir.1976) (per curiam) (affirming dismissal of section 1983 suit in which plaintiff made no claim that supervisor directed, ordered, participated in, or approved the deprivation);  Coffy, 600 F.2d at 580.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p269\">\n      <span class=\"num\">269</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges no facts even suggesting that defendants Ledbetter and Johnson participated in, encouraged, or directed the plaintiff's placement in the Lathren home, let alone that they acted with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk that the plaintiff would suffer serious physical abuse.  On the contrary, the allegations, taken as a whole, make it plain that these defendants had no role in the plaintiff's placement in or the supervision of the Lathren home.  All the plaintiff alleged was that these defendants recklessly supervised the child placement activities of DFACS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p270\">\n      <span class=\"num\">270</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court cannot be faulted for concluding that count II of the complaint failed to state a claim for relief against any of the defendants.  In granting the defendants' motion to dismiss count II, the court did not give the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>   The plaintiff, however, did not request such leave, and on appeal has not contended that the district court erred in not according her an opportunity to present sufficient factual allegations by way of an amended count.  For these reasons, I would affirm the dismissal of count II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p271\">\n      <span class=\"num\">271</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second question this case presents is whether, under Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701 (1972), the Georgia foster care statutes and regulations give a dependent child about to be placed in a foster home a \"legitimate claim of entitlement,\" i.e., the right to an adequate preplacement investigation of the foster home and proper postplacement supervision of the home, which the state cannot deny the child without due process of law.  In Roth, a state university decided not to renew the one-year contract of a non-tenured professor.  The professor brought suit, claiming that the university's action violated his procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.  As the Supreme Court observed, \"[t]he requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty and property.\"   Id. at 569, 92 S.Ct. at 2705.  The Roth Court articulated the following standard for determining whether a person possesses a constitutionally protected property interest:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p272\">\n      <span class=\"num\">272</span>\n      <p>To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.  He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.  It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined.  It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p273\">\n      <span class=\"num\">273</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution.  Rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law--rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.  Thus, the welfare recipients in [Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970),] had a claim of entitlement to welfare payments that was grounded in the statute defining eligibility for them.

The state laws or regulations must, however, create a legitimate claim of entitlement;  in other words, they must be more than mere procedural guidelines or grants of discretionary authority to state officials.   Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 471, 103 S.Ct. 864, 871, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983);  Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 344-47, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2077-79, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976);  Jean v.

Because I believe the majority has misread Georgia law and misapplied the dictates of Roth, I respectfully dissent from the court's holding on the Roth claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p277\">\n      <span class=\"num\">277</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion places a great deal of weight on the comprehensive nature of the Georgia foster care scheme, apparently ignoring the Supreme Court's admonition that the mere existence of \"a careful procedural structure\" does not preordain the existence of a protected liberty interest.   See Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 471, 103 S.Ct. at 871.  In fact, the Georgia statutory scheme is comprehensive only in granting broad discretion and authority to officials of the DHR and its county departments.  It does not, however, grant to the plaintiff any specific entitlements of the sort the Supreme Court found in Hewitt.    That case involved a prisoner's challenge to the actions of Pennsylvania prison officials in removing him from the general prison population and placing him in administrative segregation.  Under Pennsylvania statutory law, prison officials were not permitted to place inmates in administrative segregation without (1) assessing the need for that action, (2) determining that there is a threat of serious disturbances in the prison, (3) notifying the inmate that he is under investigation and that he will receive a hearing prior to any disciplinary action, (4) performing a complete investigation, and (5) conducting a hearing if the inmate is to be placed in administrative custody.

Sec. 49-5-8(a).  These statutory provisions simply grant the DHR and its county departments, including DFACS, authority and responsibility for the placement of children in foster care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p289\">\n      <span class=\"num\">289</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, Georgia law gives the DHR and its county departments the power to regulate \"child-placing and child-caring agencies,\" including the power to set standards, license these agencies, and inspect these agencies.  Id. Sec. 49-5-8(a)(6).  A child-placing agency is defined as \"any institution, society, agency, or facility, whether incorporated or not, which places children in foster homes for temporary care or for adoption.\"    Id. Sec. 49-5-3(2).  A child-caring agency \"means any institution, society, agency, or facility, whether incorporated or not, which either primarily or incidentally provides full-time care for children under 17 years of age outside of their own homes, subject to such exceptions as may be provided in rules and regulations of the board.\"    Id. Sec. 49-5-3(1).  These provisions are general grants of power, which by their nature involve broad grants of discretion to the DHR and DFACS:  discretion to set standards, to license, and to inspect child-placing and child-caring agencies.  A dependent child can have no legitimate claim of entitlement based simply on this grant of authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p290\">\n      <span class=\"num\">290</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching its conclusion that Georgia law does give rise to a legitimate claim of entitlement on behalf of the plaintiff, the majority relies on three statutory provisions and two regulations.  As the following discussion demonstrates, none of these provisions creates an entitlement on behalf of the plaintiff.  First, the majority quotes the Georgia code provision defining legal custody of a child to include \"[t]he right and the duty to protect, train, and discipline\" the child and \"[t]he responsibility to provide him with food, clothing, shelter, education, and ordinary medical care.\"    Id. Sec. 49-5-3(12).  This provision, which simply defines \"legal custody,\" is inapposite.  The gist of the plaintiff's complaint concerns the defendants' alleged failure to inspect and supervise the Lathren home;  there is no claim that the DHR or DFACS was directly involved in failing to protect the plaintiff or failing to provide her with medical care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p291\">\n      <span class=\"num\">291</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the majority inexplicably relies on Ga.Code Ann. Sec. 49-5-12(l ), stating that this provision places a mandatory duty on the DHR to investigate thoroughly each foster home and to supervise the home during the period of foster care.  In fact, section 49-5-12(l ) places the responsibilities the majority describes on \"child-placing agencies,\" not on DHR or DFACS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>   As I have noted earlier, DHR and DFACS are empowered to set standards for, license, and inspect child-placing agencies.  Section 49-5-12(l ) places the responsibility to inspect and to supervise individual foster homes on \"child-placing agencies.\"    Because no such agency, within the meaning of the Georgia code, is a defendant in this case, this section is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p292\">\n      <span class=\"num\">292</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the majority's reliance on two DHR regulations is misplaced.  These regulations provide as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p293\">\n      <span class=\"num\">293</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The selection of a foster home or group care facility for a particular child shall be based on an assessment of the child's total needs and how well a particular program can meet the child's needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p294\">\n      <span class=\"num\">294</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p295\">\n      <span class=\"num\">295</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(16) Supervision of children placed in foster homes shall be maintained by the Agency through visits made at regular intervals and as frequently as is necessary for the best interest of the child.  There shall be at least one personal contact per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p296\">\n      <span class=\"num\">296</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ga.Comp.R. &amp; Regs. r. 290-2-12-.08(3), (16) (1984) (emphasis added).  Once again, the responsibilities described in these regulations apply to child-placing agencies, not to the DHR and DFACS.  These regulations are part of a series of regulations the DHR promulgated specifically to regulate child-placing agencies.  See id. rr. 290-2-12-.01 to 290-2-12-.14.  They are contained in a chapter of the Georgia regulations entitled \"Child-Placing Agencies.\"    Moreover, one of the regulations, subsection (16), expressly grants the supervision responsibility to \"the Agency,\" which means the child-placing agency, not the DHR or DFACS.  See id. r. 290-2-12-.01(i) (defining \"agency\");  see also Ga.Code Ann. Sec. 49-5-3(2) (1986) (defining \"child-placing agency\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>   These DHR regulations do not create any duties on the part of DHR or DFACS, and thus they cannot serve as the basis for the plaintiff's Roth claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p297\">\n      <span class=\"num\">297</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the majority relies on Ga.Code Ann. Sec. 49-5-12(m) (1986), which states as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p298\">\n      <span class=\"num\">298</span>\n      <p>It shall be the duty of the [DHR] to inspect at regular intervals all licensed child welfare agencies within the state, including all family boarding homes, foster family homes, and family day-care homes used by such agencies.  The department shall have right of entrance, privilege of inspection, and right of access to all children under the care and control of the licensee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p299\">\n      <span class=\"num\">299</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision does in fact apply to the DHR, placing on it the duty to inspect all foster homes \"at regular intervals.\"    This duty arises, however, in connection with its power to license foster homes, see id. Sec. 49-5-8(a)(6)(B);  it does not confer any specific duty to oversee the placement of an individual child in the foster home.  Thus, this section simply requires that the DHR inspect foster homes, as frequently as needed for licensing purposes, to assure that its continued licensing of those homes is warranted.  Consequently, this provision does not create a legitimate claim of entitlement to have the DHR conduct a preplacement investigation or subsequently supervise the placement of an individual child in foster homes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p300\">\n      <span class=\"num\">300</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to dissenting from the majority's analysis of the Georgia foster care scheme, I am troubled by the majority's failure to recognize the analytical problem and the remedies problem created by its holding.  As the majority notes, Roth and its progeny are procedural due process cases.  If a court finds that state law creates a \"legitimate claim of entitlement,\" the next step in the Roth analysis is to determine what process is due and whether the state provided that process.   See, e.g., Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 472-77, 103 S.Ct. at 871-74.  The focus of this type of analysis is on the requirements of predeprivation notice and a hearing.  See id.    This case, however, is about investigation and supervision of foster homes, not about predeprivation notice and a hearing.  In effect, the majority holds that the plaintiff has a legitimate claim of entitlement to investigation and supervision of her foster home, but that the state can deprive her of those rights after providing notice and a hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p301\">\n      <span class=\"num\">301</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the majority creates a remedies problem:  the remedy for a procedural due process violation is restoration of the status quo ante and an injunction barring deprivation of the plaintiff's rights without the requisite procedural protections.   See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 349, 96 S.Ct. 893, 909, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) (\"All that is necessary is that the procedures be tailored, in light of the decision to be made, to 'the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard,' to insure that they are given a meaningful opportunity to present their case.\")  (citation omitted).  The plaintiff does not seek this type of remedy, and it would not make sense for her to do so, because predeprivation notice and a hearing would not provide the money damages she seeks for the injury her foster parents inflicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p302\">\n      <span class=\"num\">302</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons I have set forth, I respectfully dissent from the majority's disposition of counts I and II of the complaint in this case.

Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).  I agree with Judge Hatchett that the Georgia statutory scheme creates a liberty interest which would be protected by procedural due process.  However, I conclude that plaintiff has not stated a viable procedural due process claim.  Plaintiff's brief to the en banc court makes it clear that plaintiff is pursuing a substantive due process claim (which the majority opinion, following Doe v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.1981), finds to be viable in this case), and that plaintiff is not pursuing a procedural due process claim.  In any event, for the reasons expressed by Judge Tjoflat in the last two paragraphs of Part III of his opinion, a predeprivation denial of procedural due process makes no sense in the context of this case.  Any procedural due process claim based on a post-deprivation denial of due process would fail for failure to establish the inadequacy of Georgia's general tort remedies.   Parratt v.

See infra Part III.  Once a child has been adjudicated a dependent, the court may, for example, place the child in the custody of the county department of family and children's services, which in turn may put the child in a licensed foster home.  Alternatively, the court may give custody of the child to a licensed child-placing agency for placement in a foster home.  See Ga.Code Ann. Sec. 15-11-34 (1985).  The complaint does not allege that any \"child-placing agency,\" as defined under Georgia law, played a role in the selection of the foster home in this case or in the supervision of the plaintiff's stay in that home.  See generally infra Part III (discussing Georgia foster care scheme).  I thus assume that no child-placing agency was involved in the plaintiff's placement and that DFACS placed the plaintiff directly in the foster home</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The complaint includes, for example, an allegation that the defendants \"were grossly negligent and deliberately indifferent in failing to acquire or procure complete physical and medical data concerning the Plaintiff and to provide same to the foster parents to whom the custody, supervision, and care of the Plaintiff was given.\"    In light of other allegations in the complaint, this statement apparently is part of an alternate explanation for the plaintiff's injuries, i.e., that her injuries resulted from an unnecessary or excessive dose of medicine, not from physical abuse by her foster mother</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Count III alleged that the defendants deprived the plaintiff of rights guaranteed by 42 U.S.C.

Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)</p>\n        <p>The court dismissed count II on several grounds.  First, it correctly noted that the eighth amendment is inapplicable outside the prison context.  Second, it indicated that the plaintiff \"has specifically not sought to recover\" under Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), and Doe v. New York City Dep't of Social Servs., 649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.1981), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 864, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983).  Although the complaint is ambiguous, I believe it at least attempts to allege a Doe claim.  The plaintiff argued the merits of this claim in her brief opposing the defendants' motion to dismiss, and in her brief in support of her motion to alter the district court's final judgment and for a rehearing.  Third, the court believed that the defendants were immune from liability under Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982);  the majority does not address the immunity question, which should be reconsidered by the district court on remand.  Finally, the court believed that the complaint merely alleged administrative negligence insufficient to state a claim under section 1983.</p>\n        <p>As to count III, the district court properly dismissed the plaintiff's claim in light of the rationale of Black v. Beame, 550 F.2d 815 (2d Cir.1977) (portions of Social Security Act governing aid to families with dependent children do not create a private cause of action).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The eighth amendment's protections are of course made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment, see Estelle, 429 U.S. at 101, 97 S.Ct. at 289.  The eighth amendment only applies to convicts in government custody and thus is obviously inapplicable here.  I therefore treat count II as asserting a substantive right created by the \"penumbras\" of the Bill of Rights and made enforceable against the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.  In this opinion, I assume for sake of discussion that the Bill of Rights created the substantive right that the plaintiff asserts in count II</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Section 1983 provides a federal remedy against \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.\"    42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (1982).  Every section 1983 action requires a showing (1) that the defendant deprived the plaintiff of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or federal law, and (2) that the defendant was acting under color of state law.   Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1913, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), overruled on other grounds, Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986);  Dollar v. Haralson County, 704 F.2d 1540, 1542-43 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 963, 104 S.Ct. 399, 78 L.Ed.2d 341 (1983).  Except for count III, which is meritless, see supra notes 5 &amp; 6, the plaintiff's complaint is based solely on an alleged deprivation of constitutional rights</p>\n        <p>To establish that a state official's nonfeasance has deprived an individual of a constitutional right, a section 1983 plaintiff must prove three elements.  First, he must demonstrate the existence of a custodial or other special relationship in which the state has exposed the plaintiff to harm or danger.   See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 103-04, 97 S.Ct. at 290-91;  Jones v. Phyfer, 761 F.2d 642, 645-47 (11th Cir.1985);  Jensen v. Conrad, 747 F.2d 185, 193 (4th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1052, 105 S.Ct. 1754, 84 L.Ed.2d 818 (1985);  Doe, 649 F.2d at 141.</p>\n        <p>Second, the alleged nonfeasance must cause the deprivation of a constitutional right.   See Martinez, 444 U.S. at 284-85, 100 S.Ct. at 559;  Gilmere v. City of Atlanta, 774 F.2d 1495, 1504 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc) (plaintiff must prove the existence of an \"affirmative link\" between the alleged deprivation and the action or inaction of the state officials), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 1970, 90 L.Ed.2d 654 and --- U.S. ----, 106 S.Ct. 1993, 90 L.Ed.2d 673 (1986);  see also Doe, 649 F.2d at 141 (\"[T]he omissions must have been a substantial factor leading to the denial of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.\")  (citation omitted).  This causation requirement is more stringent than, for example, the proximate cause requirement of tort law.   See Martinez, 444 U.S. at 285, 100 S.Ct. at 559 (\"Regardless of whether, as a matter of state tort law, the parole board could be said ... to have proximately caused [the victim's] death, we hold that, taking these particular allegations as true, appellees did not 'deprive' [the victim] of life within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\")  (citations omitted).</p>\n        <p>The third requirement for section 1983 liability is that the state officials must have displayed at least \"deliberate indifference\" to the plaintiff's situation.   Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-06, 97 S.Ct. 291-92;  Doe, 649 F.2d at 141.  This requirement is the focus of my dissent concerning the plaintiff's Doe claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The Seventh Circuit's opinion in Bowers did not indicate the specific constitutional source of the substantive right, if any, on which the deceased woman's personal representative based his claim.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span> (1986).  Second, they contend that the Georgia statutory scheme for child placement and supervision does not create any entitlements to children placed in foster homes.  Their third contention is that the allegations in the child's complaint are conclusory, and if not conclusory, are not sufficient to support a due process claim;  and their fourth claim is that because the Gwinnett County Juvenile Court made the decision to remove the child from the natural parents they cannot be liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first contention is easily decided.  In Daniels and Davidson, the Supreme Court held that the due process clause is not implicated by the negligent act of an official causing unintended loss or injury to life, liberty, or property.  The complaint in this case, however, alleges, in each paragraph, that the officials were \"grossly negligent\" or \"deliberately indifferent.\"    Thus, the complaint is sufficient to overcome either a Daniels or Davidson bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can also easily dispose of the state officials' fourth contention that the action of the Gwinnett County Juvenile Court insulates them from liability.

In Youngberg, the mother of a mentally retarded person involuntarily committed to a Pennsylvania state institution upon her petition filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 seeking damages against the institution's officials.  The mother alleged that the officials knew or should have known that her son was suffering injuries, but failed to take appropriate preventive procedures, thereby violating his rights under the eighth and fourteenth amendments.  The Supreme Court recognized the child's liberty interest in the safety of his environment and noted that the right to personal security constitutes a \"historic liberty interest\" protected substantively by the due process clause.

In this case, the child's physical safety was a primary objective in placing the child in the foster home.  The state's action in assuming the responsibility of finding and keeping the child in a safe environment placed an obligation on the state to insure the continuing safety of that environment.  The state's failure to meet that obligation, as evidenced by the child's injuries, in the absence of overriding societal interests, constituted a deprivation of liberty under the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful that a liberty interest protected by the due process clause involves a balancing.  \"In determining whether a substantive right protected by the due process clause has been violated, it is necessary to balance 'the liberty of the individual' and 'the demands of an organized society.' \"   Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 320, 102 S.Ct. at 2460, 73 L.Ed.2d at 40.

The Doe court held that where a state official's deliberate indifference is a substantial factor in denying property or liberty interests, a child in foster care is in a situation analogous to a prisoner in state custody.

In Doe, a foster child sued her legal custodian and a voluntary child welfare agency which provided foster care under a contract with the city of New York.  In the suit, the foster child alleged that state officials violated her constitutional rights when, with the knowledge of possible sexual abuse from her foster father, they failed to investigate or remove her from the foster home.  The Second Circuit held that government officials may be liable under section 1983 not only for overt activity which is unlawful and harmful, but also for failure to act when the duty to act exists.  \"When individuals are placed in custody or under the care of the government, their governmental custodians are sometimes charged with affirmative duties, the nonfeasance of which may violate the Constitution.  Thus, nonperformance of such custodial duties has been held to give rise to a section 1983 cause of action for prisoners.\"   Doe, 649 F.2d at 141.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Is a foster child involuntarily placed in a foster home in a situation so similar to that of a prisoner involuntarily placed in an institution that similar rules of law should be applied?    We believe so.  We recognize that the situations are not parallel.  Obviously, a closer relationship exists between superior officers, subordinate officers, and the inmates within a prison than exists between a state agency, the foster parents, and the foster child in a foster care setting.  In a penal institution, all the persons involved are in close and daily contact.  Wardens and supervisors have the ability to daily monitor the activities of subordinates as well as the effect of certain conduct upon inmates.  Although the contacts between actors in the foster home situation are not as close as in the penal institution the situations are close enough to be held analogous.  The lack of proximity in the foster home situation simply suggests that deliberate indifference is not as easily inferred or shown from a failure to act.  A child abused while in foster care, in order to successfully recover from state officials in a section 1983 action, will be faced with the difficult problem of showing actual knowledge of abuse or that agency personnel deliberately failed to learn what was occurring in the foster home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although mindful of the fact that the eighth amendment has historically been limited to criminal proceedings, such substantial similarities exist between a prisoner's situation and the situation of a minor child forced into a foster home that we are justified in holding that the situations are sufficiently analogous to support a section 1983 action.

In finding that imposing corporal punishment upon school children in public schools does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, the Supreme Court relied heavily upon the support which a school child receives from family, friends, teachers, and other pupils who may witness and protest mistreatment.  The Court acknowledged, in its well-known footnote, that some circumstances may be sufficiently analogous to criminal processes as to justify application of the eighth amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>   The Court expressly left open the question of whether and under what circumstances persons involuntarily confined in juvenile institutions may claim eighth amendment protection.  In Ingraham, the Court discussed the cost of providing additional benefits and safeguards to school children threatened with punishment.  It found the cost of benefits and additional safeguards high and the risk of harm to the school children low.  In the foster home setting, recent events lead us to believe that the risk of harm to children is high.  We believe the risk of harm is great enough to bring foster children under the umbrella of protection afforded by the fourteenth amendment.  Children in foster homes, unlike children in public schools, are isolated;  no persons outside the home setting are present to witness and report mistreatment.  The children are helpless.  Without the investigation, supervision, and constant contact required by statute, a child placed in a foster home is at the mercy of the foster parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourteenth amendment, like the eighth amendment, \"must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\"   Trop v.

Special Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not alone in our holding.  Other circuits have recognized that special relationships may support section 1983 actions.  In Bowers v. DeVito, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"407837\"><a href=\"/opinion/407837/thomas-l-bowers-administrator-of-the-estate-of-marguerite-anne-bowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1982), the Seventh Circuit refused to hold the state liable for a murder committed by a schizophrenic (with a history of criminal violence) one year after being released from a state mental hospital.  The court in Bowers stated that \"there is no constitutional right to be protected by the state against being murdered by criminals or madmen.\"   Bowers, 686 F.2d at 618.  However, the Bowers court held that an affirmative duty obligating the state to protect private citizens' safety and health could arise from special custodial or other relationships--where the state is responsible for placing such person in a \"position of danger\" or potential harm.  The court in Bowers stated:  \"If the state puts a man in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him, it will not be heard to say that its role was merely passive;  it is as much an active tort feasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.  It is on this theory that state prison personnel are sometimes held liable under section 1983 for the violence of one prison inmate against another.\"   Bowers, 686 F.2d at 618.  The Bowers court refused to distinguish between custodial relationships and \"other relationships created by the state.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Circuit in Fox v.

The Fox court expressly stated the nexus between the state and a private citizen necessary to an action under section 1983:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With one qualification, we agree with the Seventh Circuit's recent holding that, in general, there simply is 'no constitutional right to be protected by the state against ... criminals or madmen,' and that because, in corollary, there is no 'constitutional duty [on the state] to provide such protection, its failure to do so is not actionable under section 1983.'   Bowers v. DeVito, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"407837\"><a href=\"/opinion/407837/thomas-l-bowers-administrator-of-the-estate-of-marguerite-anne-bowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span>, 618 (7th Cir.1982).  The qualification--an important one actually acknowledged by the Bowers court, Id. --is that such a right and corollary duty may arise out of special custodial or other relationships created or assumed by the state in respect of particular persons.  [Original emphasis.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fox, 712 F.2d at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liberty interest which the plaintiff alleges is also sufficiently borne out by our decision in Dollar v. Harralson County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416900\"><a href=\"/opinion/416900/james-m-dollar-and-etta-marie-dollar-v-haralson-county-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1540</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1983).  In Dollar, we stated:  \"In determining whether a constitutional deprivation has occurred, courts must examine whether the defendant was under any obligation to the particular plaintiff.  The question of the existence of such a duty is an issue of law.\"    704 F.2d at 1543.  We went on to note that the existence of duties resulting from relationships is usually clear in section 1983 cases, citing the relationship between prisoners and wardens and hospitals and patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dollar suggests that the more important the relationship and its attendant duties, the more likely it is that an act or omission on the part of one party has the potential to deprive the other of a constitutional right.  The relationship between state officials charged with carrying out a foster child care program and the children in the program is an important one involving substantial duties and, therefore, substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has also recognized the \"special relationship\" analysis.   Jones v.

The Jones court, in noting that \"[t]here are cases which demonstrate the type of special relationship required for an action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983,\" stated:  \"the case workers were hired specifically to protect the children and ... it would therefore be unreasonable to characterize the child's death as too remote a consequence of the case workers' failure to perform their duties.\"   Jones, 761 F.2d at 645.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Roth Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The child also contends that the statutes and regulations of the state of Georgia create in her a legitimate and sufficiently vested claim of entitlement such that deprivation of that entitlement without due process of law imposes on her a grievous loss.  This claim is based on the Supreme Court's holding in Board of Regents v. Roth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span> (1972).  In Roth, the Court held that procedural due process applies to the deprivation of interests encompassed within the fourteenth amendment's protection of liberty and property when a person has acquired specific benefits through state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must look to the Georgia statutes and ordinances to determine whether they indicate an intention to bestow benefits upon children in the care of the state or upon children placed by the state in foster homes.  An appendix is attached setting forth the statutes and ordinances involved in this case.  The district court's order provides an excellent summary of the pertinent Georgia statutes and ordinances:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>The Georgia statute in question provides generally that the Department of Human Resources is authorized to use its facilities for the assistance of children in several ways, including child welfare services, preventive services, services to courts, and regulation of child placing and child caring agencies.  See O.C.G.A. Sec. 49-5-8.  Moreover, O.C.G.A. Sec. 49-5-9(b) requires that institutions and agencies which have custody of children who are committed to the Department shall be inspected by the Department.  The regulations governing foster care services which are those most directly applicable to the present case are found at O.C.G.R.R.G. Sec. 290-2-12-.08.  These regulations require the development of a plan for a child placed in foster care which is responsive to the child's needs, is attentive to the duration of the placement, projects necessary medical services, and sets goals toward enabling the child to be replaced with his natural family.  Subsection (3) of that section provides that the selection of a foster home should be based upon an assessment of the child's total needs and how well a particular program can meet the child's needs.  Subsection (13) provides that the agency shall evaluate each foster home including:  motives;  adjustment of the foster family to each other and the community;  foster family's attitude toward the parents of the foster child;  the family's expectations of behavior of foster children;  physical standards;  community resources;  the physical, mental, and emotional health of each member of the foster family;  foster parent training;  and adequacy of financial resources.  Subsection (16) provides that supervision of children in foster homes is to be maintained by the agency 'through visits made at regular intervals and as frequently as is necessary for the best interest of the child.'    The section continues that there must be at least one personal contact each month.    Subsection (19) of the foster child regulations provides that the agency shall maintain a file for each foster child which includes, inter alia, the child's medical history and a health record.  [Emphasis added.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of the comprehensive and direct nature of the statutory commands, the district court concluded that the statutes and ordinances only provided \"procedural guidelines\" to be followed in arriving at decisions.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Georgia statutes provide more than just \"procedural guidelines\" to be followed in arriving at decisions.  The Georgia foster care and placement scheme is a comprehensive one.  The Children and Youth Act provides that \"legal custody embodies:  '(B) the right and the duty to protect [children] ... and (C) the responsibility to provide food, clothing, shelter, education, and ordinary medical care.' \"    O.C.G.A. Sec. 49-5-3(12).  The law governing the licensing of child placement agencies clearly mandates that the Department of Human Resources \"in placing children in foster family homes, shall safeguard the welfare of such children by thoroughly investigating each such home and the character and reputation of the persons residing therein and shall adequately supervise each home during the period of care.\"    \"... It shall be the duty of the department to inspect at regular intervals all licensed child welfare agencies within the state including ... foster family homes....\"  O.C.G.A. Sec. 49-5-12(l), (m).  The regulations governing foster care services are found in O.C.R.R.G. Sec. 290-2-12-08.  Subsection 3 of that section provides that the selection of a foster home should be based upon an assessment of the child's total needs and how well a particular program meets the child's needs.  Section 16 provides that supervision of children in foster homes is to be maintained \"through visits made at regular intervals and as frequently as necessary for the best interest of the child.\"    (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the Georgia scheme mandates that officials follow guidelines and take affirmative actions to ensure the well being and promote the welfare of children in foster care.  These children can state a claim based upon deprivation of a liberty interest in personal safety when the officials fail to follow this mandate.  \"In a constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of 'liberty' must be broad indeed.\"   Board of Regents v.

In August 1982, DFACS placed the plaintiff in a foster home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>   According to the complaint, the foster parents, Roy Michael Lathren and Linda Price Lathren, \"were legally and morally unfit to be entrusted with the custody, supervision, and care of the Plaintiff and such fact was known to the Defendants or should have been known to them in the exercise of even slight care.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p239\">\n      <span class=\"num\">239</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1982, the plaintiff suffered serious physical injuries and eventually lapsed into a coma from which she has yet to recover.  The circumstances surrounding this tragedy are uncertain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>   The complaint alleges that the plaintiff, \"on or about October 13, 1982, was wantonly and willfully struck, shaken, thrown down, beaten, and otherwise severely abused by the foster mother.\"    Further, the complaint alleges that \"[t]he foster parents wantonly and willfully failed to seek emergency medical treatment for the Plaintiff until October 17, 1982, when she suffered seizures and lapsed into a coma.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p240\">\n      <span class=\"num\">240</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff, through her guardian ad litem, brought suit in the district court under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (1982).  The complaint named several defendants:  James G. Ledbetter, Ph.D., Commissioner of the DHR;  Patricia Johnson, Ph.D., Director of the DHR's Division of Family and Children's Services;  Frederick B. Webb, Director of DFACS;  Sonyonna Stone Danielle, supervisor of placement services for DFACS;  and Jo Ann Hoover and W.R. Berry, DFACS caseworkers.  The complaint consisted of three counts, two of which are relevant here.  Count I alleged that the defendants, in violation of the fourteenth amendment, deprived the plaintiff of liberty without due process of law by denying her entitlements (an adequate preplacement investigation, and subsequent supervision of her custody in her foster home) that the Georgia foster care scheme granted her.  In count II, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated the substantive guarantees of the eighth and fourteenth amendments because, with deliberate indifference, they failed to discharge their duty to inspect the Lathren home before placing the plaintiff there and they failed to supervise the Lathrens' care of the child.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p241\">\n      <span class=\"num\">241</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the district court dismissed, without leave to amend,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> all counts of the plaintiff's complaint.  The plaintiff then appealed.

In Estelle, the Supreme Court, observing that a state has an obligation to provide its prison inmates necessary medical care, held that the \"deliberate indifference\" of state prison personnel to an inmate's serious illness or injury constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, giving rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a>   As the Court stated, \"[t]his is true whether the indifference is manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.\"   Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05, 97 S.Ct. at 291 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p244\">\n      <span class=\"num\">244</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seventh Circuit applied the Estelle rationale in a case in which a mental patient murdered a woman after being discharged from a state psychiatric hospital.

Id. at 617.  The court upheld the district court's judgment summarily dismissing the plaintiff's claim on the merits, but acknowledged that a constitutional claim for reckless indifference could lie, under 42 U.S.C.

Regardless of whether, as a matter of state tort law, the parole board could be said either to have had a \"duty\" to avoid harm to his victim or to have proximately caused her death, we hold that, taking these particular allegations as true, [the parole officials] did not \"deprive\" [the] decedent of life within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p250\">\n      <span class=\"num\">250</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The decedent's] life was taken by the [offender] five months after his release.

We need not and do not decide that a parole officer could never be deemed to \"deprive\" someone of life by action taken in connection with the release of a prisoner on parole.  But we do hold that at least under the particular circumstances of this parole decision, [the] decedent's death is too remote a consequence of the parole officers' action to hold them responsible under the federal civil rights law.  Although a Sec. 1983 claim has been described as \"a species of tort liability,\" it is perfectly clear that not every injury in which a state official has played some part is actionable under that statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p251\">\n      <span class=\"num\">251</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 284-85, 100 S.Ct. at 559 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis added);  see also Bowers, 686 F.2d at 617-19 (state mental hospital not liable under section 1983 for releasing a mental patient who subsequently murdered a woman, because the officials had not knowingly placed the victim, a member of the general public, in a position of danger).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixteen months after the Supreme Court handed down its Martinez decision, the Second Circuit decided Doe.    That case involved a section 1983 claim by a foster child against a child-placement agency licensed by the City of New York.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a>   She alleged that her foster father had sexually abused her for a number of years, that the agency had knowledge of facts placing it on notice of that abuse, and that the agency ignored these facts and had done nothing to alleviate the situation.  The agency's conduct, she alleged, amounted to deliberate indifference to her safety in the foster home and thus deprived her of a liberty interest without due process of law, in violation of the fourteenth amendment.

The plaintiff appealed, seeking a new trial on the ground that the district court's jury instruction on the doctrine of deliberate indifference imposed on her a greater burden of proof than that doctrine mandated.  The court of appeals agreed and remanded the case for a new trial.   Id. at 141.  In its opinion, the court recognized a point that we should bear in mind in deciding this case:  a foster child seeking damages against a child placement agency or its officials for child abuse inflicted by a foster parent faces a heavier burden in establishing deliberate indifference than does a prison inmate seeking damages against prison officials for cruel and unusual punishment.  For example, unlike the prison situation, there is no strong chain of command in the placement and supervision of children in foster care:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a closer and firmer line of authority running from superiors and subordinates within [a penal] institution than exists in the foster care context, particularly in respect of the relationship between agency personnel and the foster parent.  [Prison] administrators can readily call in subordinates for consultation.  They can give strict orders with reasonable assurance that their mandates will be followed, and as added insurance other employees stationed in proximity of the subordinates to whom orders are directed may be instructed to monitor compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the [foster care agency] ha[s] to rely upon occasional visits for its information gathering, and its relationship to the foster family [is] less unequivocally hierarchical than is the case with prison guards and a warden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 142.  Moreover, to give the child a normal family environment, foster care officials understandably feel \"constrained to respect the foster family's autonomy and integrity[,] and [feel] pressured to minimize intrusiveness.\"    Id.  Prison officials, on the other hand, feel no such constraint or pressure;  their role is to monitor and control an inmate's environment and activities on a day-to-day basis.  Consequently, prison officials will normally have more information available to them about the conditions of an inmate's confinement than officials overseeing foster care will have about the conditions of a foster home placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deliberate indifference standard of fault--used by the Supreme Court in Estelle and, purportedly, by the majority today--is analogous to reckless disregard of safety, which is well defined in tort law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p>The actor's conduct is in reckless disregard of the safety of another if he does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 500 (1965) (hereinafter Restatement );  see also Doe, 649 F.2d 143-44 &amp; nn. 4-5.

It differs from that form of negligence which consists in mere inadvertence, incompetence, unskillfulness, or a failure to take precautions to enable the actor adequately to cope with a possible or probable future emergency, in that reckless misconduct requires a conscious choice of a course of action, either with knowledge of the serious danger to others involved in it or with knowledge of facts which would disclose this danger to any reasonable man.    It differs not only from the above-mentioned form of negligence, but also from that negligence which consists in intentionally doing an act with knowledge that it contains a risk of harm to others, in that the actor to be reckless must recognize that his conduct involves a risk substantially greater in amount than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.  The difference between reckless misconduct and conduct involving only such a quantum of risk as is necessary to make it negligent is a difference in the degree of the risk, but this difference of degree is so marked as to amount substantially to a difference in kind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p261\">\n      <span class=\"num\">261</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement, supra, Sec. 500 comment g (emphasis added);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  see also Doe, 649 F.2d 143-44 &amp; n. 5.  Thus, to establish deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendants either had actual knowledge of a substantial risk or had knowledge of facts that would indicate this risk to any reasonable person.   See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-06, 97 S.Ct. at 291-92;  Doe, 649 F.2d at 141.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p262\">\n      <span class=\"num\">262</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, it is more difficult for a foster child, who has suffered physical abuse at the hands of his or her foster parents, to prove that the abuse flowed from the deliberate indifference of the child placement official than it is for a prison inmate to satisfy that standard in an eighth amendment case.  This difference is a function of the notice requirement of the deliberate indifference standard.  As the Second Circuit noted in Doe, in the relationship between foster care officials and foster parents, the officials will inherently have less information about the foster care setting--and thus less knowledge of potential danger to the foster child--than their prison official counterparts will have concerning the inmates in their charge.  With these observations and the Restatement principles in mind, I shall assess the sufficiency of the plaintiff's allegations in count II of her complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p263\">\n      <span class=\"num\">263</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I first assess the plaintiff's allegations against W.R. Berry, the caseworker whom DFACS assigned to handle the plaintiff's case, because he is the defendant most likely to have known that the plaintiff faced a substantial danger of child abuse in the Lathren home or to have had knowledge of facts that would have led a reasonable person to conclude that the plaintiff faced such a danger.  The plaintiff alleged that (1) Berry had the duty to investigate the Lathren home and to supervise it while the plaintiff lived there and (2) Berry failed \"to make a thorough and complete investigation and study\" of that home.  These allegations do not even state a claim of negligence, because they do not disclose whether Berry would have discovered, in the exercise of due care, that the plaintiff faced a risk of child abuse if placed in the Lathren home.  Nonetheless, granting the plaintiff's complaint the most liberal reading, I proceed on the assumption that the complaint alleges that Berry would have discovered this risk and therefore that it states a cause of action for simple negligence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p264\">\n      <span class=\"num\">264</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state a claim of deliberate indifference, however, the plaintiff had to allege additional facts:  that Berry either had actual knowledge that the plaintiff faced a substantial risk of child abuse in the Lathren home or had knowledge of facts that would have caused a reasonable person to conclude that the child faced this risk.  The plaintiff alleged no such additional facts.  It is true that she alleged that Berry acted with deliberate indifference in failing to carry out his investigative and supervisory duties, a mere conclusion of ultimate fact.  The plaintiff did not, however, take the requisite further step and allege that Berry acted with deliberate indifference toward a known danger of the child abuse she eventually suffered.  The plaintiff did assert that the Lathrens \"were legally and morally unfit\" to be foster parents (which I will assume means that the Lathrens would likely abuse the plaintiff), but she did not also allege that Berry--or, for that matter, any of the other defendants--knew this fact.  When the allegations in a complaint are vague and conclusory, \"and fail to set forth facts which, if proved, would warrant the relief sought, it is proper to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\"   Davidson v. State of Georgia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"378902\"><a href=\"/opinion/378902/g-davidson-aka-john-doe-v-state-of-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span>, 897 (5th Cir.1980) (per curiam) (citations omitted);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  see also Fullman v.

Thus, the plaintiff failed to state a claim for relief against Berry in count II of her complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p265\">\n      <span class=\"num\">265</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is buttressed by the Supreme Court's rationale and holding in Martinez v.

There, the Court concluded that parole officials could not be held liable under section 1983 even though they released a known sex offender who was likely to commit a violent crime and even though the murder of the victim was foreseeable.   Id. at 278, 100 S.Ct. at 556.  In the instant case, the officials had no knowledge that the Lathrens had any propensity for child abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p266\">\n      <span class=\"num\">266</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Seventh Circuit's Bowers decision supports my conclusion.  As the court noted in Bowers, \"[i]f the state puts a man in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him, it will not be heard to say that its role was merely passive;  it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.\"   Bowers v.

There is no allegation in this case that the Lathren foster home was the equivalent of a snake pit and that the defendants knew this fact or had knowledge of facts that would have led a reasonable person to recognize it as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p267\">\n      <span class=\"num\">267</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's allegations against the remaining defendants suffer from the same deficiency described above.  The allegations do not set forth facts indicating what, if anything, these defendants knew about the danger of physical abuse the plaintiff faced if DFACS placed her, or permitted her to remain, in the Lathren home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>   All the plaintiff alleged was the conclusion that these defendants<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> were deliberately indifferent in carrying out their duties to ensure that the caseworker, Berry, did his job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p268\">\n      <span class=\"num\">268</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's upholding of count II of the complaint against defendants Ledbetter and Johnson, the DHR officials in the state capital, is particularly disturbing in light of those defendants' complete separation from the events that brought about the plaintiff's injury.

On the contrary, the allegations, taken as a whole, make it plain that these defendants had no role in the plaintiff's placement in or the supervision of the Lathren home.

In Roth, a state university decided not to renew the one-year contract of a non-tenured professor.  The professor brought suit, claiming that the university's action violated his procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.  As the Supreme Court observed, \"[t]he requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty and property.\"   Id. at 569, 92 S.Ct. at 2705.  The Roth Court articulated the following standard for determining whether a person possesses a constitutionally protected property interest:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p272\">\n      <span class=\"num\">272</span>\n      <p>To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.  He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.  It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined.  It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p273\">\n      <span class=\"num\">273</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution.  Rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law--rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.  Thus, the welfare recipients in [Goldberg v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108100\"><a href=\"/opinion/108100/goldberg-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108100\"><a href=\"/opinion/108100/goldberg-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because I believe the majority has misread Georgia law and misapplied the dictates of Roth, I respectfully dissent from the court's holding on the Roth claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p277\">\n      <span class=\"num\">277</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion places a great deal of weight on the comprehensive nature of the Georgia foster care scheme, apparently ignoring the Supreme Court's admonition that the mere existence of \"a careful procedural structure\" does not preordain the existence of a protected liberty interest.   See Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 471, 103 S.Ct. at 871.  In fact, the Georgia statutory scheme is comprehensive only in granting broad discretion and authority to officials of the DHR and its county departments.  It does not, however, grant to the plaintiff any specific entitlements of the sort the Supreme Court found in Hewitt.    That case involved a prisoner's challenge to the actions of Pennsylvania prison officials in removing him from the general prison population and placing him in administrative segregation.  Under Pennsylvania statutory law, prison officials were not permitted to place inmates in administrative segregation without (1) assessing the need for that action, (2) determining that there is a threat of serious disturbances in the prison, (3) notifying the inmate that he is under investigation and that he will receive a hearing prior to any disciplinary action, (4) performing a complete investigation, and (5) conducting a hearing if the inmate is to be placed in administrative custody.

Sec. 49-5-8(a).  These statutory provisions simply grant the DHR and its county departments, including DFACS, authority and responsibility for the placement of children in foster care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p289\">\n      <span class=\"num\">289</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, Georgia law gives the DHR and its county departments the power to regulate \"child-placing and child-caring agencies,\" including the power to set standards, license these agencies, and inspect these agencies.  Id. Sec. 49-5-8(a)(6).  A child-placing agency is defined as \"any institution, society, agency, or facility, whether incorporated or not, which places children in foster homes for temporary care or for adoption.\"    Id. Sec. 49-5-3(2).  A child-caring agency \"means any institution, society, agency, or facility, whether incorporated or not, which either primarily or incidentally provides full-time care for children under 17 years of age outside of their own homes, subject to such exceptions as may be provided in rules and regulations of the board.\"    Id. Sec. 49-5-3(1).  These provisions are general grants of power, which by their nature involve broad grants of discretion to the DHR and DFACS:  discretion to set standards, to license, and to inspect child-placing and child-caring agencies.  A dependent child can have no legitimate claim of entitlement based simply on this grant of authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p290\">\n      <span class=\"num\">290</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching its conclusion that Georgia law does give rise to a legitimate claim of entitlement on behalf of the plaintiff, the majority relies on three statutory provisions and two regulations.  As the following discussion demonstrates, none of these provisions creates an entitlement on behalf of the plaintiff.  First, the majority quotes the Georgia code provision defining legal custody of a child to include \"[t]he right and the duty to protect, train, and discipline\" the child and \"[t]he responsibility to provide him with food, clothing, shelter, education, and ordinary medical care.\"    Id. Sec. 49-5-3(12).  This provision, which simply defines \"legal custody,\" is inapposite.  The gist of the plaintiff's complaint concerns the defendants' alleged failure to inspect and supervise the Lathren home;  there is no claim that the DHR or DFACS was directly involved in failing to protect the plaintiff or failing to provide her with medical care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p291\">\n      <span class=\"num\">291</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the majority inexplicably relies on Ga.Code Ann. Sec. 49-5-12(l ), stating that this provision places a mandatory duty on the DHR to investigate thoroughly each foster home and to supervise the home during the period of foster care.  In fact, section 49-5-12(l ) places the responsibilities the majority describes on \"child-placing agencies,\" not on DHR or DFACS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>   As I have noted earlier, DHR and DFACS are empowered to set standards for, license, and inspect child-placing agencies.  Section 49-5-12(l ) places the responsibility to inspect and to supervise individual foster homes on \"child-placing agencies.\"    Because no such agency, within the meaning of the Georgia code, is a defendant in this case, this section is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p292\">\n      <span class=\"num\">292</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the majority's reliance on two DHR regulations is misplaced.  These regulations provide as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p293\">\n      <span class=\"num\">293</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The selection of a foster home or group care facility for a particular child shall be based on an assessment of the child's total needs and how well a particular program can meet the child's needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p294\">\n      <span class=\"num\">294</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p295\">\n      <span class=\"num\">295</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(16) Supervision of children placed in foster homes shall be maintained by the Agency through visits made at regular intervals and as frequently as is necessary for the best interest of the child.  There shall be at least one personal contact per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p296\">\n      <span class=\"num\">296</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ga.Comp.R. &amp; Regs. r. 290-2-12-.08(3), (16) (1984) (emphasis added).  Once again, the responsibilities described in these regulations apply to child-placing agencies, not to the DHR and DFACS.  These regulations are part of a series of regulations the DHR promulgated specifically to regulate child-placing agencies.  See id. rr. 290-2-12-.01 to 290-2-12-.14.  They are contained in a chapter of the Georgia regulations entitled \"Child-Placing Agencies.\"    Moreover, one of the regulations, subsection (16), expressly grants the supervision responsibility to \"the Agency,\" which means the child-placing agency, not the DHR or DFACS.  See id. r. 290-2-12-.01(i) (defining \"agency\");  see also Ga.Code Ann. Sec. 49-5-3(2) (1986) (defining \"child-placing agency\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>   These DHR regulations do not create any duties on the part of DHR or DFACS, and thus they cannot serve as the basis for the plaintiff's Roth claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p297\">\n      <span class=\"num\">297</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the majority relies on Ga.Code Ann. Sec. 49-5-12(m) (1986), which states as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p298\">\n      <span class=\"num\">298</span>\n      <p>It shall be the duty of the [DHR] to inspect at regular intervals all licensed child welfare agencies within the state, including all family boarding homes, foster family homes, and family day-care homes used by such agencies.  The department shall have right of entrance, privilege of inspection, and right of access to all children under the care and control of the licensee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p299\">\n      <span class=\"num\">299</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision does in fact apply to the DHR, placing on it the duty to inspect all foster homes \"at regular intervals.\"    This duty arises, however, in connection with its power to license foster homes, see id. Sec. 49-5-8(a)(6)(B);  it does not confer any specific duty to oversee the placement of an individual child in the foster home.  Thus, this section simply requires that the DHR inspect foster homes, as frequently as needed for licensing purposes, to assure that its continued licensing of those homes is warranted.  Consequently, this provision does not create a legitimate claim of entitlement to have the DHR conduct a preplacement investigation or subsequently supervise the placement of an individual child in foster homes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p300\">\n      <span class=\"num\">300</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to dissenting from the majority's analysis of the Georgia foster care scheme, I am troubled by the majority's failure to recognize the analytical problem and the remedies problem created by its holding.  As the majority notes, Roth and its progeny are procedural due process cases.  If a court finds that state law creates a \"legitimate claim of entitlement,\" the next step in the Roth analysis is to determine what process is due and whether the state provided that process.   See, e.g., Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 472-77, 103 S.Ct. at 871-74.  The focus of this type of analysis is on the requirements of predeprivation notice and a hearing.  See id.    This case, however, is about investigation and supervision of foster homes, not about predeprivation notice and a hearing.  In effect, the majority holds that the plaintiff has a legitimate claim of entitlement to investigation and supervision of her foster home, but that the state can deprive her of those rights after providing notice and a hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p301\">\n      <span class=\"num\">301</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the majority creates a remedies problem:  the remedy for a procedural due process violation is restoration of the status quo ante and an injunction barring deprivation of the plaintiff's rights without the requisite procedural protections.   See Mathews v. Eldridge, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 349, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The plaintiff does not seek this type of remedy, and it would not make sense for her to do so, because predeprivation notice and a hearing would not provide the money damages she seeks for the injury her foster parents inflicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p302\">\n      <span class=\"num\">302</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons I have set forth, I respectfully dissent from the majority's disposition of counts I and II of the complaint in this case.

I agree with Judge Hatchett that the Georgia statutory scheme creates a liberty interest which would be protected by procedural due process.  However, I conclude that plaintiff has not stated a viable procedural due process claim.  Plaintiff's brief to the en banc court makes it clear that plaintiff is pursuing a substantive due process claim (which the majority opinion, following Doe v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390440\"><a href=\"/opinion/390440/maria-doe-and-cruz-doe-individually-and-on-behalf-of-their-minor-son/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1981), finds to be viable in this case), and that plaintiff is not pursuing a procedural due process claim.  In any event, for the reasons expressed by Judge Tjoflat in the last two paragraphs of Part III of his opinion, a predeprivation denial of procedural due process makes no sense in the context of this case.  Any procedural due process claim based on a post-deprivation denial of due process would fail for failure to establish the inadequacy of Georgia's general tort remedies.   Parratt v.

The complaint does not allege that any \"child-placing agency,\" as defined under Georgia law, played a role in the selection of the foster home in this case or in the supervision of the plaintiff's stay in that home.  See generally infra Part III (discussing Georgia foster care scheme).  I thus assume that no child-placing agency was involved in the plaintiff's placement and that DFACS placed the plaintiff directly in the foster home</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The complaint includes, for example, an allegation that the defendants \"were grossly negligent and deliberately indifferent in failing to acquire or procure complete physical and medical data concerning the Plaintiff and to provide same to the foster parents to whom the custody, supervision, and care of the Plaintiff was given.\"    In light of other allegations in the complaint, this statement apparently is part of an alternate explanation for the plaintiff's injuries, i.e., that her injuries resulted from an unnecessary or excessive dose of medicine, not from physical abuse by her foster mother</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Count III alleged that the defendants deprived the plaintiff of rights guaranteed by 42 U.S.C.

The plaintiff argued the merits of this claim in her brief opposing the defendants' motion to dismiss, and in her brief in support of her motion to alter the district court's final judgment and for a rehearing.  Third, the court believed that the defendants were immune from liability under Harlow v. Fitzgerald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Finally, the court believed that the complaint merely alleged administrative negligence insufficient to state a claim under section 1983.</p>\n        <p>As to count III, the district court properly dismissed the plaintiff's claim in light of the rationale of Black v. Beame, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343399\"><a href=\"/opinion/343399/randall-black-v-abraham-beame-individually-and-as-mayor-of-the-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1977) (portions of Social Security Act governing aid to families with dependent children do not create a private cause of action).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The eighth amendment's protections are of course made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment, see Estelle, 429 U.S. at 101, 97 S.Ct. at 289.  The eighth amendment only applies to convicts in government custody and thus is obviously inapplicable here.  I therefore treat count II as asserting a substantive right created by the \"penumbras\" of the Bill of Rights and made enforceable against the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.  In this opinion, I assume for sake of discussion that the Bill of Rights created the substantive right that the plaintiff asserts in count II</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Section 1983 provides a federal remedy against \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.\"    42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (1982).

See Martinez, 444 U.S. at 285, 100 S.Ct. at 559 (\"Regardless of whether, as a matter of state tort law, the parole board could be said ... to have proximately caused [the victim's] death, we hold that, taking these particular allegations as true, appellees did not 'deprive' [the victim] of life within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\")  (citations omitted).</p>\n        <p>The third requirement for section 1983 liability is that the state officials must have displayed at least \"deliberate indifference\" to the plaintiff's situation.   Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-06, 97 S.Ct. 291-92;  Doe, 649 F.2d at 141.

Sec. 1-3-8 (\"The state is not bound by the passage of a law unless it is named therein or unless the words of the law are so plain, clear, and unmistakable as to leave no doubt as to the intention of the General Assembly.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The other regulation, subsection (3), makes no express reference to the entity upon which it places responsibility.  Nonetheless, the DHR's placement of this regulation among a series of regulations describing the duties of child-placing agencies makes it plain that the regulation was meant to apply to those agencies.  In any event, I believe that subsection (3)--even if it did apply to the DHR and DFACS--is too general to warrant a legitimate claim of entitlement under Roth</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Of course, the majority also holds that the plaintiff has a Doe claim for violation of her substantive due process rights.  That claim, however, is analytically distinct from the Roth claim</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
