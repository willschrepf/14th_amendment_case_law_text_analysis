In two issues, Thomas argues\r\nthat the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's\r\nfindings. We affirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse the award\r\nof attorney's fees, and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial on\r\nattorney's fees. <p></p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September of 2005, Thomas hired Goodman to service the trees located on\r\nThomas's ranch in Gillespie\r\n County. The parties\r\ndispute exactly what services Goodman was hired to perform. Thomas maintains he\r\nhired Goodman to perform ball moss eradication services on his century-old oak\r\ntrees. Goodman counters that he was hired to perform trimming, pruning,\r\ntopping, removal, and fertilizing of trees as described in a written agreement\r\ndated September 18, 2005 and signed by the parties. The agreement contained a\r\nprice per tree based on size, but did not contain a total price. Small trees\r\nwere priced at $10 per tree, medium trees at $30, and large trees at $50 to\r\n$150; fertilization was $5 per tree and the price of tree removal was to be\r\ndetermined based on the size of the tree. On Monday, Goodman began work on Thomas's\r\nproperty and at the end of the <span class=\"GramE\">week,</span> Goodman presented\r\nThomas with an invoice totaling $8,940: $4,805 for tree trimming, pruning, and\r\ntopping; $550 for tree removal; and $3,585 for tree fertilization. Thomas\r\ndisputed the total charge, arguing that not all 717 trees had been fertilized.\r\nThomas asked Goodman to remove the $3,585 fertilization charge and claims they\r\nagreed that Thomas would immediately pay $5,000 to Goodman, as well as an\r\nadditional $2,500 when the project was completed to Thomas's satisfaction.\r\nGoodman, however, maintains that he was \"coerced\" into accepting the\r\n$5,000 as a draw on work performed and promised to return the next Monday to\r\ncomplete the work as directed by Thomas. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following Monday, Goodman returned to the ranch to complete the work;\r\nThomas claims that Goodman called him later that day and asked that he\r\nimmediately come to the ranch to inspect the work and pay the additional\r\n$2,500. Thomas claims he was unable to inspect the work that day, and refused\r\nto pay the $2,500 before reviewing Goodman's work. Thomas further claims that\r\nGoodman then began yelling over the phone and threatened to \"drop every\r\ntree on the ranch\" if he did not receive a check that day. According to\r\nGoodman, however, Thomas told him he was not going to pay because \"no man\r\nis worth more than $10 an hour.\" Thomas then stopped payment on the $5,000\r\ncheck he had previously paid to Goodman, resulting in an overdraft on Goodman's\r\naccount. Subsequently, Thomas claims that when he returned to the ranch, he discovered\r\nthat several trees had open wounds, had not been fertilized, or had not been\r\nremoved as agreed. He then paid $5,895.67 to another tree service company to\r\ncomplete the unfinished ball moss eradication project. In January of 2006,\r\nThomas discovered that Goodman had placed a mechanic's lien on his property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thereafter, Goodman sued Thomas, asserting claims for breach of written\r\ncontract, quantum <span class=\"SpellE\">meruit</span>, common law fraud, and\r\nbreach of oral contract, and seeking damages in the amount of $11,260 as well\r\nas attorney's fees. In response, Thomas pled the affirmative defenses of\r\nduress, <span class=\"SpellE\">estoppel</span>, fraud, and waiver, and also\r\ncounterclaimed for breach of contract and violation of the deceptive trade\r\npractices act; Thomas also sought remedies related to the \"fraudulent\"\r\nmechanic's lien filed by Goodman. The case was tried to a jury, who found that\r\nan agreement existed between Thomas and Goodman and found in favor of Goodman\r\nfor $11,260. The jury further awarded attorney's fees to Goodman in the amount\r\nof $26,776.38. Subsequently, Thomas filed a motion for new trial challenging\r\nthe legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's finding\r\nthat an agreement existed between the parties and also challenging the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's award of attorney's fees\r\nbecause Goodman never presented his claim to Thomas and because Goodman failed\r\nto segregate his attorney's fees. The trial court denied Thomas's motion for\r\nnew trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On appeal, Thomas argues that the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support: 1) the jury's finding that a contract existed between\r\nthe parties, and 2) the jury's award of attorney's fees. We will discuss each\r\nissue in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Standard of Review</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When an appellant attacks the legal sufficiency\r\nof an adverse finding on an issue on\r\nwhich he did not have the burden of proof, the appellant must demonstrate there\r\nis no evidence to support the adverse finding. <em>See <span class=\"SpellE\">Croucher</span> v. <span class=\"SpellE\">Croucher</span>, </em><span class=\"GramE\">660 S.W.2d 55, 58</span> (Tex.\r\n1983).

Nussbaum,</em> 940 S.W.2d 350, 352 (Tex.\r\nApp.--San Antonio 1997, no writ).</span> Thomas contests the third element,\r\narguing that there was no meeting of the minds with respect to the terms of the\r\ncontract because (1) the September 18, 2005 agreement did not contain a final\r\nprice and (2) there is a factual dispute as to what services Goodman was hired\r\nto perform. When a meeting of the minds is the only element in dispute, the\r\nexistence of a contract is a question of fact. <span class=\"SpellE\"><em>Buxani</em></span>,\r\n<span class=\"GramE\">940 S.W.2d at 352</span>. The determination of whether there\r\nis a meeting of the minds is based upon objective standards of what the parties\r\nsaid and did. <em>Copeland</em>, <span class=\"GramE\">3 S.W.3d at 604</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To create a binding, enforceable agreement, the parties must agree on all\r\nthe essential terms. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>T.O.

App.--San\r\nAntonio 1996, writ denied).</span> It is well established that parties may\r\nagree to the material terms of a contract, and leave\r\nother matters open for later negotiation; it is only when an essential term is\r\nleft open for future negotiation that no binding contract\r\nexists. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>T.O. Stanley,</em> 847 S.W.2d at 221; <span class=\"SpellE\"><em>Komet</em></span><em> v. Graves,</em> 40 S.W.3d 596,\r\n602Â (Tex.\r\nApp.--San Antonio 2001, no pet.).</span> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was ample evidence at trial to show that the parties did have a\r\nmeeting of the minds on the essential terms of the contract as set forth in the\r\nSeptember 18, 2005 written agreement. Thomas admitted that he agreed with\r\nGoodman to enter into a contract for services on a per tree basis. He also\r\nstated he intended to pay Goodman for the work he performed based on the size\r\nof the tree (small, medium, or large) or number of trees to be fertilized.\r\nAlthough the final contract price was not known by either party at the time the\r\nwritten agreement was signed, that amount was readily determinable based on the\r\ndetails provided within the written agreement. It is noteworthy that Thomas\r\ninitially paid $5,000 to Goodman for work performed under the agreement. Thomas\r\ntestified that he later stopped payment on the $5,000 check because Goodman did\r\nnot complete the work, not because the contract was invalid or because the\r\nfinal amount owed could not be determined. Because the essential terms of the\r\ncontract were mutually agreed upon, and the final cost could be calculated from\r\nknown terms, we hold that the contract was sufficiently definite. <em>See Fort Worth <span class=\"SpellE\">Indep</span>. Sch. Dist. v. City of Fort Worth</em>, 22 S.W.3d\r\n831, 846 (Tex.\r\n2000) (stating that a contract is legally binding when terms are sufficiently\r\ndefinite to enable court to understand parties' obligations). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas also asserts that no meeting of the minds occurred because a factual\r\ndispute existed as to the particular services he hired Goodman to perform.\r\nThomas testified that he hired Goodman to perform ball moss eradication, yet\r\nGoodman testified that he does not perform and is not qualified to perform ball\r\nmoss eradication. The September 18, 2005 agreement signed by the parties does\r\nnot mention ball moss eradication, but specifies that trees will be trimmed,\r\npruned, topped, removed, and fertilized. Again, whether a meeting of the minds\r\nexisted is a question of fact to be determined by the <span class=\"SpellE\">trier</span>\r\nof fact. <span class=\"SpellE\"><em>Buxani</em></span>, <span class=\"GramE\">940\r\nS.W.2d at 352</span>. Here, the jury was free to believe Goodman's testimony\r\nover Thomas's, and to find that the parties agreed that the trees would be\r\nserviced in accordance with the terms provided in the September 18, 2005\r\nagreement. <em>See</em><em>\r\n City</em><em> of Keller,</em>\r\n168Â S.W.3d at 819 (a jury confronted with conflicting evidence may choose\r\nto believe one witness and disbelieve others and may resolve inconsistencies in\r\nthe testimony of any witness). Thus, we cannot hold that the evidence of a\r\nvalid contract between Thomas and Goodman was legally insufficient. Moreover,\r\nthe evidence supporting the existence of a valid contract was not so against\r\nthe great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and\r\nunjust. Thomas's first issue is overruled. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><b>Attorney's Fees </b></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas next argues Goodman did not properly present his claim for breach of\r\ncontract, and is therefore not entitled to attorney's fees on that claim under\r\nChapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Section 38.001 provides that a person may recover\r\nreasonable attorney's fees on a\r\nclaim based on an oral or written contract. <span class=\"GramE\">Tex.</span><span class=\"GramE\"> Civ. <span class=\"SpellE\">Prac</span>.</span> <span class=\"GramE\">&amp;\r\nRem. Code Ann. Â§ 38.001(8) (Vernon\r\n1997).</span> To recover attorney's fees\r\nunder section 38.002,\r\nthe claimant must comply with the following requirements: 1) the claimant must\r\nbe represented by an attorney; 2) the claimant must\r\npresent the claim to the opposing party or to a duly authorized agent of the\r\nopposing party; and 3) payment for the just amount owed must not have been\r\ntendered within thirty days of presentment. <span class=\"GramE\">Tex.</span><span class=\"GramE\"> Civ. <span class=\"SpellE\">Prac</span>.</span> &amp; Rem. Code Ann. Â§\r\n38.002 (Vernon 1997); <em>see Harrison\r\nv. <span class=\"SpellE\">Gemdrill</span> Intern</em>.,<em> Inc</em>., 981 S.W.2d\r\n714, 719 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, pet. denied). Presentment\r\nof the claim is required to provide the other party with an opportunity to pay\r\nthe claim before incurring an obligation for attorney's fees. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>Harrison</em>, 981 S.W.2d at\r\n719; <em>Jones v.

Co.</em>, <em>Inc</em>., 101 S.W.3d 619, 627 (Tex. App.--Houston\r\n[1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied).</span> Here, the record contains a letter dated\r\nDecember 16, 2005, which was sent by Goodman's attorney to Thomas demanding\r\npayment of $11,260 for services rendered by Goodman. Accordingly, we hold that\r\nthe claim for attorney's fees was sufficiently presented for purposes of\r\nsection 38.002. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We next determine whether Goodman was required to segregate attorney's fees\r\nbetween his breach of contract and tort causes of action. In <em>Tony <span class=\"SpellE\">Gullo</span> Motors I</em>,<em> L.P. v. Chapa</em>, the Texas\r\nSupreme Court held that \"if any attorney's fees relate solely to a claim\r\nfor which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable\r\nfrom unrecoverable fees.\" <span class=\"GramE\">212 S.W.3d 299, 313 (Tex. 2006).</span> It is\r\nonly when legal services advance both recoverable and unrecoverable claims that\r\nthe services are so inextricably intertwined that the associated fees need not\r\nbe segregated<em>. <span class=\"GramE\">Id.</span></em><span class=\"GramE\">Â at 313-14.</span> Thus, the general duty to segregate fees\r\napplies, unless a party meets its burden of establishing that the same discrete\r\nlegal services were rendered with respect to both a recoverable and\r\nunrecoverable claim. <span class=\"GramE\"><em>Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 314; <em>Hong\r\nKong Development, Inc. v. Nguyen</em>, 229Â S.W.3d 415, 455 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 2007, no pet.).</span> Under <em>Chapa</em>, the determining factor as\r\nto whether fees must be segregated is the type of legal services rendered with\r\nrespect to the particular claims, not simply the manner of pleading or the type\r\nof claim pled. <em>Chapa</em>, <span class=\"GramE\">212 S.W.3d at 313-14</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jury awarded Goodman the total amount of fees sought based on two\r\nbilling statements detailing the basis for the fees requested by date, time\r\nspent, and task accomplished. Several of the time entries appear clearly\r\nunrelated to the breach of contract action, such as drafting pleadings for\r\ncommon law fraud. Although the fraud claim stems from the same set of facts as\r\nthe breach of contract claim, <em>Chapa</em> clarified that intertwined facts\r\nalone are insufficient to excuse segregation. <em>See Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d at\r\n313-14 (disavowing prior rule suggesting that a common set of underlying facts\r\nnecessarily makes all claims arising <span class=\"SpellE\">therefrom</span>\r\n\"inseparable\" and thus all legal fees recoverable). Because the\r\njury's award of attorney's fees included time spent on matters other than the\r\nbreach of contract action, segregation of fees is required. <em>Id.</em><em> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, Goodman's attorney provided no testimony that all of the work he\r\nperformed on Goodman's behalf was so \"inextricably intertwined\" with\r\nthe breach of contract action that the fees could not be segregated, nor did he\r\ntestify regarding what percentage of his time was spent solely on the breach of\r\ncontract action. <em>See Nguyen,</em> 229 S.W.3d at 455 (party seeking\r\nattorney's fees bears burden of demonstrating that exception to duty to\r\nsegregate fees applies). Because Goodman failed to present any evidence\r\nsupporting an exception, segregation of fees is required. Accordingly, the\r\ntrial court erred in awarding Goodman attorney's fees for the total number of\r\nhours spent on the case. On this record, we must reverse the judgment of the\r\ntrial court as it relates to attorney's fees and remand the cause for a new\r\ntrial on attorney's fees. <em>See A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

In two issues, Thomas argues\r\nthat the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's\r\nfindings. We affirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse the award\r\nof attorney's fees, and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial on\r\nattorney's fees. <p></p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September of 2005, Thomas hired Goodman to service the trees located on\r\nThomas's ranch in Gillespie\r\n County. The parties\r\ndispute exactly what services Goodman was hired to perform. Thomas maintains he\r\nhired Goodman to perform ball moss eradication services on his century-old oak\r\ntrees. Goodman counters that he was hired to perform trimming, pruning,\r\ntopping, removal, and fertilizing of trees as described in a written agreement\r\ndated September 18, 2005 and signed by the parties. The agreement contained a\r\nprice per tree based on size, but did not contain a total price. Small trees\r\nwere priced at $10 per tree, medium trees at $30, and large trees at $50 to\r\n$150; fertilization was $5 per tree and the price of tree removal was to be\r\ndetermined based on the size of the tree. On Monday, Goodman began work on Thomas's\r\nproperty and at the end of the <span class=\"GramE\">week,</span> Goodman presented\r\nThomas with an invoice totaling $8,940: $4,805 for tree trimming, pruning, and\r\ntopping; $550 for tree removal; and $3,585 for tree fertilization. Thomas\r\ndisputed the total charge, arguing that not all 717 trees had been fertilized.\r\nThomas asked Goodman to remove the $3,585 fertilization charge and claims they\r\nagreed that Thomas would immediately pay $5,000 to Goodman, as well as an\r\nadditional $2,500 when the project was completed to Thomas's satisfaction.\r\nGoodman, however, maintains that he was \"coerced\" into accepting the\r\n$5,000 as a draw on work performed and promised to return the next Monday to\r\ncomplete the work as directed by Thomas. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following Monday, Goodman returned to the ranch to complete the work;\r\nThomas claims that Goodman called him later that day and asked that he\r\nimmediately come to the ranch to inspect the work and pay the additional\r\n$2,500. Thomas claims he was unable to inspect the work that day, and refused\r\nto pay the $2,500 before reviewing Goodman's work. Thomas further claims that\r\nGoodman then began yelling over the phone and threatened to \"drop every\r\ntree on the ranch\" if he did not receive a check that day. According to\r\nGoodman, however, Thomas told him he was not going to pay because \"no man\r\nis worth more than $10 an hour.\" Thomas then stopped payment on the $5,000\r\ncheck he had previously paid to Goodman, resulting in an overdraft on Goodman's\r\naccount. Subsequently, Thomas claims that when he returned to the ranch, he discovered\r\nthat several trees had open wounds, had not been fertilized, or had not been\r\nremoved as agreed. He then paid $5,895.67 to another tree service company to\r\ncomplete the unfinished ball moss eradication project. In January of 2006,\r\nThomas discovered that Goodman had placed a mechanic's lien on his property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thereafter, Goodman sued Thomas, asserting claims for breach of written\r\ncontract, quantum <span class=\"SpellE\">meruit</span>, common law fraud, and\r\nbreach of oral contract, and seeking damages in the amount of $11,260 as well\r\nas attorney's fees. In response, Thomas pled the affirmative defenses of\r\nduress, <span class=\"SpellE\">estoppel</span>, fraud, and waiver, and also\r\ncounterclaimed for breach of contract and violation of the deceptive trade\r\npractices act; Thomas also sought remedies related to the \"fraudulent\"\r\nmechanic's lien filed by Goodman. The case was tried to a jury, who found that\r\nan agreement existed between Thomas and Goodman and found in favor of Goodman\r\nfor $11,260. The jury further awarded attorney's fees to Goodman in the amount\r\nof $26,776.38. Subsequently, Thomas filed a motion for new trial challenging\r\nthe legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's finding\r\nthat an agreement existed between the parties and also challenging the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's award of attorney's fees\r\nbecause Goodman never presented his claim to Thomas and because Goodman failed\r\nto segregate his attorney's fees. The trial court denied Thomas's motion for\r\nnew trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On appeal, Thomas argues that the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support: 1) the jury's finding that a contract existed between\r\nthe parties, and 2) the jury's award of attorney's fees. We will discuss each\r\nissue in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Standard of Review</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When an appellant attacks the legal sufficiency\r\nof an adverse finding on an issue on\r\nwhich he did not have the burden of proof, the appellant must demonstrate there\r\nis no evidence to support the adverse finding. <em>See <span class=\"SpellE\">Croucher</span> v. <span class=\"SpellE\">Croucher</span>, </em><span class=\"GramE\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1676997\"><a href=\"/opinion/1676997/croucher-v-croucher/\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 58</span> (Tex.\r\n1983).

Thomas admitted that he agreed with\r\nGoodman to enter into a contract for services on a per tree basis. He also\r\nstated he intended to pay Goodman for the work he performed based on the size\r\nof the tree (small, medium, or large) or number of trees to be fertilized.\r\nAlthough the final contract price was not known by either party at the time the\r\nwritten agreement was signed, that amount was readily determinable based on the\r\ndetails provided within the written agreement. It is noteworthy that Thomas\r\ninitially paid $5,000 to Goodman for work performed under the agreement. Thomas\r\ntestified that he later stopped payment on the $5,000 check because Goodman did\r\nnot complete the work, not because the contract was invalid or because the\r\nfinal amount owed could not be determined. Because the essential terms of the\r\ncontract were mutually agreed upon, and the final cost could be calculated from\r\nknown terms, we hold that the contract was sufficiently definite. <em>See Fort Worth <span class=\"SpellE\">Indep</span>. Sch. Dist. v. City of Fort Worth</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376552/fort-worth-indep-school-dist-v-fort-worth/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span>, 846 (Tex.\r\n2000) (stating that a contract is legally binding when terms are sufficiently\r\ndefinite to enable court to understand parties' obligations). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas also asserts that no meeting of the minds occurred because a factual\r\ndispute existed as to the particular services he hired Goodman to perform.\r\nThomas testified that he hired Goodman to perform ball moss eradication, yet\r\nGoodman testified that he does not perform and is not qualified to perform ball\r\nmoss eradication. The September 18, 2005 agreement signed by the parties does\r\nnot mention ball moss eradication, but specifies that trees will be trimmed,\r\npruned, topped, removed, and fertilized. Again, whether a meeting of the minds\r\nexisted is a question of fact to be determined by the <span class=\"SpellE\">trier</span>\r\nof fact. <span class=\"SpellE\"><em>Buxani</em></span>, <span class=\"GramE\">940\r\nS.W.2d at 352</span>. Here, the jury was free to believe Goodman's testimony\r\nover Thomas's, and to find that the parties agreed that the trees would be\r\nserviced in accordance with the terms provided in the September 18, 2005\r\nagreement. <em>See</em><em>\r\n City</em><em> of Keller,</em>\r\n168Â S.W.3d at 819 (a jury confronted with conflicting evidence may choose\r\nto believe one witness and disbelieve others and may resolve inconsistencies in\r\nthe testimony of any witness). Thus, we cannot hold that the evidence of a\r\nvalid contract between Thomas and Goodman was legally insufficient. Moreover,\r\nthe evidence supporting the existence of a valid contract was not so against\r\nthe great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and\r\nunjust. Thomas's first issue is overruled. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><b>Attorney's Fees </b></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas next argues Goodman did not properly present his claim for breach of\r\ncontract, and is therefore not entitled to attorney's fees on that claim under\r\nChapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Section 38.001 provides that a person may recover\r\nreasonable attorney's fees on a\r\nclaim based on an oral or written contract. <span class=\"GramE\">Tex.</span><span class=\"GramE\"> Civ. <span class=\"SpellE\">Prac</span>.</span> <span class=\"GramE\">&amp;\r\nRem.

Accordingly, we hold that\r\nthe claim for attorney's fees was sufficiently presented for purposes of\r\nsection 38.002. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We next determine whether Goodman was required to segregate attorney's fees\r\nbetween his breach of contract and tort causes of action. In <em>Tony <span class=\"SpellE\">Gullo</span> Motors I</em>,<em> L.P. v.

Several of the time entries appear clearly\r\nunrelated to the breach of contract action, such as drafting pleadings for\r\ncommon law fraud. Although the fraud claim stems from the same set of facts as\r\nthe breach of contract claim, <em>Chapa</em> clarified that intertwined facts\r\nalone are insufficient to excuse segregation. <em>See Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d at\r\n313-14 (disavowing prior rule suggesting that a common set of underlying facts\r\nnecessarily makes all claims arising <span class=\"SpellE\">therefrom</span>\r\n\"inseparable\" and thus all legal fees recoverable). Because the\r\njury's award of attorney's fees included time spent on matters other than the\r\nbreach of contract action, segregation of fees is required. <em>Id.</em><em> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, Goodman's attorney provided no testimony that all of the work he\r\nperformed on Goodman's behalf was so \"inextricably intertwined\" with\r\nthe breach of contract action that the fees could not be segregated, nor did he\r\ntestify regarding what percentage of his time was spent solely on the breach of\r\ncontract action. <em>See Nguyen,</em> 229 S.W.3d at 455 (party seeking\r\nattorney's fees bears burden of demonstrating that exception to duty to\r\nsegregate fees applies). Because Goodman failed to present any evidence\r\nsupporting an exception, segregation of fees is required. Accordingly, the\r\ntrial court erred in awarding Goodman attorney's fees for the total number of\r\nhours spent on the case. On this record, we must reverse the judgment of the\r\ntrial court as it relates to attorney's fees and remand the cause for a new\r\ntrial on attorney's fees. <em>See A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Beyer</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894912\"><a href=\"/opinion/894912/ag-edwards-sons-inc-v-beyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span>, 710 (Tex. 2007); <em>see also Nguyen,</em> 229 S.W.3d at 455-56\r\n(\"When an appellate court sustains a challenge that attorney's fees were\r\nnot properly segregated, the remedy is to sever that portion of the judgment\r\nawarding attorney's\r\nfees and to remand the cause for the issue to be <span class=\"SpellE\">relitigated</span>.\").\r\nOn remand, the standard established by the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Chapa </em>for segregating attorney's fees will apply. <em>See\r\nChapa</em>, <span class=\"GramE\">212 S.W.3d at 313-14</span>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We affirm the judgment against Thomas awarding Goodman damages in the amount\r\nof $11,260 for breach of contract; we reverse the award of attorney's fees and\r\nremand the cause to the trial court for recalculation of attorney's fees. <p></p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"SpellE\">Phylis</span> J. <span class=\"SpellE\">Speedlin</span>, Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.
