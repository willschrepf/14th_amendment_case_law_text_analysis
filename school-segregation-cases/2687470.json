(“Regional Gastroenterology”)\n\n(collectively, “Appellees”), and dismissing Appellants’ amended complaint\n\nwith prejudice. Although this case nominally presents several issues, their\n\nresolution principally rests upon our answer to one question: Whether, as\n\nthe trial court ruled, the lack of an express statutory civil remedy under the\n\nChild Protective Services Law (“CPSL”), 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 6301, et seq.,\n\nimplicitly precludes a common-law remedy in tort for harms sustained due to\n\nchild abuse when a physician has failed to report reasonable suspicions that\n\na child is a victim of abuse to the government authorities designated by the\n\nCPSL. After careful review of the record and the seventeen party briefs filed\n\nin this case, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\nI.    Introduction\n\n      This case presents this Court with various challenges to two trial court\n\norders that entered summary judgment for Appellees and collectively\n\ndismissed all of Appellants’ claims against the Appellees.        Motions for\n\nsummary judgment are governed by Pa.R.C.P. 1035.2, which provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n      After the relevant pleadings are closed, but within such time as\n      not to unreasonably delay trial, any party may move for\n      summary judgment in whole or in part as a matter of law\n\n           (1)   whenever there is no genuine issue of any material\n                 fact as to a necessary element of the cause of action\n                 or defense which could be established by additional\n                 discovery or expert report, or\n\n           (2)   if, after the completion of discovery relevant to the\n                 motion including the production of expert reports, an\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n              adverse party who will bear the burden of proof at\n              trial has failed to produce evidence of facts essential\n              to the cause of action or defense which in a jury trial\n              would require the issues to be submitted to a jury.\n\nPa.R.C.P. 1035.2.\n\n     In reviewing an order granting or denying summary judgment, we\n\napply the following standard:\n\n     We must examine the entire record in the light most favorable to\n     the non-moving party and resolve all doubts against the moving\n     party when determining if there is a genuine issue of material\n     fact. We will only reverse the lower court’s grant of summary\n     judgment if there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Summary\n     judgment should be granted only in cases where the right is\n     clear and free of doubt. Summary judgment serves to eliminate\n     the waste of time and resources of both litigants and the courts\n     in cases where a trial would be a useless formality.\n\nFirst v. Zem Zem Temple, 686 A.2d 18, 20 (Pa. Super. 1996) (citations\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Although it is clear that a jury is not permitted to reach a verdict\n     based upon guess or speculation, it is equally clear that a jury\n     may draw inferences from all of the evidence presented. Cade\n     v. McDanel, 679 A.2d 1266 (Pa. Super. 1996).\n\n        It is not necessary, under Pennsylvania law, that every fact\n        or circumstance point unerringly to liability; it is enough\n        that there be sufficient facts for the jury to say reasonably\n        that the preponderance favors liability. . . . The facts are\n        for the jury in any case whether based upon direct or\n        circumstantial evidence where a reasonable conclusion can\n        be arrived at which would place liability on the defendant.\n        It is the duty of [the] plaintiffs to produce substantial\n        evidence which, if believed, warrants the verdict they\n        seek. . . . A substantial part of the right to trial by jury is\n        taken away when judges withdraw close cases from the\n        jury. . . .\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n      Id. at 1271 (quoting Smith v. Bell Tel. Co. of Penna.,\n      153 A.2d 477, 480 (Pa. 1959)).\n\nFirst, 686 A.2d at 21 (citations modified).\n\nII.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      As noted, we are constrained in this procedural posture to grant\n\nAppellants the most favorable account of the evidence of record.              For\n\npresent purposes, the trial court’s account of the factual background and\n\nprocedural history of this case suffices.\n\n      [K.H.] was born to [H.S.] and her former husband, [C.S.], on\n      June 29, 2002 at [LGH]. [K.H.] was born prematurely at thirty-\n      three weeks[’] gestation as a result of maternal preeclampsia.\n      Following his birth, [K.H.] was admitted to the Neonatal\n      Intensive Care Unit where he remained until his release from the\n      hospital on July 15, 2002. After his discharge, [K.H.] was\n      monitored by Dr. Shakthi Kumar at [Lancaster Pediatric]. [K.H.]\n      suffered from respiratory, cardiac and gastrointestinal\n      complications due to his prematurity, and was admitted to LGH\n      on five occasions in July and August of 2002 pursuant to these\n      issues.\n\n      On September 9, 2002, [H.S.] took [K.H.] to [Lancaster\n      Pediatric] with symptoms including congestion, spitting up,\n      wheezing and refusing to sleep and eat. [K.H.] was examined\n      by Dr. Yvonne Siwek, who ordered a chest X-ray. The X-ray was\n      performed and read by Dr. Julie Mack at LGH. Dr. Mack noted\n      that [K.H.’s] lungs were clear, but that the X-ray showed healing\n      fractures of the fifth and sixth ribs and flattening of the vertebral\n      bodies at T8, T9, T12, L2, L3 and L4. Dr. Mack discussed her\n      findings with Dr. Siwek by telephone. While concerned about\n      the potential of child abuse, Dr. Mack concluded that the more\n      likely cause of the injuries was a congenital issue secondary to\n      [K.H.’s] premature birth.           Dr. Siwek memorialized the\n      conversation with an entry in her office chart and referred [K.H.]\n      to Dr. Donald Diverio, a pediatric orthopedist at AO Orthopedics.\n\n      On September 12, 2002, [K.H.] was examined by Dr. Diverio.\n      Dr. Diverio noted that [K.H.] became irritable upon palpation of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n     his ribs. Dr. Diverio additionally reviewed the September 9th X-\n     rays. At the conclusion of the office visit, Dr. Diverio accused\n     [H.S. and C.S.] of child abuse.1 After the appointment, [H.S.\n     and C.S.] took [K.H.] to see Dr. Kumar and told her about\n     Dr. Diverio’s allegations. [Appellants] assert that, following their\n     conversation, Dr. Kumar called Dr. Diverio and discussed\n     [K.H.’s] injuries with him.\n\n     ____________________\n        1\n           During his deposition, Dr. Diverio denied accusing [H.S.\n        and C.S.] of abusing [K.H.]. Nevertheless, for summary\n        judgment purposes, viewing the record in the light most\n        favorable to the non-moving party, the [c]ourt will assume\n        that these allegations were made as pled in Plaintiffs’\n        Amended Complaint.\n\n     Later the same day, [K.H.] underwent a bone survey performed\n     and read by Dr. Mack at LGH.          Dr. Mack’s report identified\n     healing rib fractures and vertebral deformities.\n\n     On October 2, 2002, [K.H.] was seen by Dr. Atilla Devenyi, a\n     gastroenterologist at [Regional Gastroenterology]. Dr. Devenyi\n     examined [K.H.] and noted a rash or bruise on his sternum and\n     chest wall. Dr. Devenyi reported his findings to Dr. Kumar.\n     [K.H.] was seen in Dr. Kumar’s office on October 3, 2002, where\n     she also observed the mark on his lateral chest wall and\n     sternum.    Dr. Kumar noted in her office chart, “Seen by\n     Dr. Devenyi yesterday. Ordered PT/PTT, CBC with platelets for a\n     pattern seen on the chest that was suspicious for abuse. He also\n     ordered a skeletal survey[.”] Later that day, Dr. Kumar spoke\n     with Dr. Devenyi about the skeletal survey and laboratory tests\n     that he ordered, and, following their conversation, the tests were\n     canceled.\n\n     On December 3, 2002, [K.H.] presented at [Lancaster Pediatric]\n     for an appointment with Dr. Kumar. Dr. Kumar examined [K.H.]\n     and noted an increase in the size of his head as well as a bruise\n     on his forearm. On December 6, 2002, [K.H.] underwent a\n     chest X-ray at LGH. Dr. Mack read the X-ray and reported[]\n     “minimal deformity of [the] anterior lateral 7th rib compatible\n     with [a] remote healing fracture” as well as “smooth periosteal\n     reaction involving both humeri[.”] Dr. Mack additionally noted,\n     “if there is any clinical concern of non-accidental trauma, full\n     skeletal series should be performed[.”]\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n       On December 6, 2002, [K.H.] underwent         an ultrasound of his\n       head at LGH. Dr. Gene Smigocki read           and interpreted the\n       ultrasound and noted, “no evidence             of hydronephrosis.\n       Asymmetrically prominent left frontal horn.   No hemorrhage[.”]\n\n       On December 18, 2002, [K.H.] was discovered at home in his\n       crib unresponsive by [C.S.] and was rushed to LGH. A CT scan\n       of his head was performed[,] which showed a left frontal\n       intracranial hemorrhage. Consequently, [K.H.] was transported\n       via helicopter to Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. It was later\n       confirmed that [K.H.] had suffered non-accidental injuries\n       including “contusion in the high left parietal region with\n       surrounding edema with mass effect, interhemispheric subdural\n       hematoma, tentorium subdural hematoma, and small left\n       frontoparietal subdural hematoma[.”]        It was additionally\n       determined that [K.H.] suffered these injuries because he was\n       shaken. As a consequence of this incident, [C.S.] was charged\n       with and convicted of felony child abuse and is currently serving\n       a five- to ten[-]year prison sentence.\n\n       [Appellants] claim that, as a result of his injuries, [K.H.] suffers\n       from permanent brain damage and seizures, physical and\n       neurodevelopmental deficits, disabilities and delays, delayed\n       growth and development, and other physical traumas.\n       [Appellants] additionally allege that [K.H.] has sustained\n       numerous personal injuries including substantial pain and\n       suffering, mental anguish, loss of life’s pleasures, humiliation,\n       embarrassment and disfigurement.\n\n       On January 13, 2009, [H.S.] and her current husband, [E.H.], on\n       behalf of [K.H.] and in their own right, filed a Complaint for\n       medical professional liability in the Lancaster County Court of\n       Common Pleas.        In the Complaint, [Appellants] asserted\n       negligence claims against Dr. Kumar, Dr. Siwek, [Lancaster\n       Pediatric], Dr. Diverio, AO Orthopedics, Dr. Mack, [Lancaster\n       Radiology,] and LGH, alleging that they collectively failed to\n       recognize, treat and report child abuse pursuant to\n       Pennsylvania’s [CPSL] §§ 6311 and § 6313.[2] [Appellees] filed\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n       Specifically, section 6311 of the CPSL obligates, inter alia, any person\n“licensed or certified to practice in any health-related field under the\njurisdiction of the Department of State,” as well as any “employee of a\nhealth care facility or provider licensed by the Department of Health, who is\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n      Preliminary Objections in the nature of a demurrer, which\n      [o]bjections were overruled without [o]pinion by the Honorable\n      Dennis E. Reinaker on October 13, 2009. On November 19,\n      2009, the Court amended its [o]rder overruling the [p]reliminary\n      [o]bjections to include a certification for immediate interlocutory\n      appeal to the Superior Court. [Appellees] then filed a “Petition\n      for Allowance of Appeal” with the Superior Court[,] which was\n      denied via a per curiam [o]rder on February 16, 2010.\n\n      On August 11, 2011, [Appellants] filed an Amended Complaint\n      containing additional claims of negligence against Dr. Avallone,\n      Dr. Smigocki, Dr. Devenyi and [Regional Gastroenterology],\n      alleging that they also failed to report a suspicion of child abuse\n      pursuant to the CPSL. Moreover, [Appellants] asserted medical\n      negligence claims against Drs. Mack and Smigocki based upon\n      misreads of radiographic imaging.         [Appellees] demurred a\n      second time, and their [p]reliminary [o]bjections were overruled\n      again without [o]pinion by Judge Reinaker on January 4, 2012.\n      On June 22, 2012, the case was reassigned to me [i.e., Judge\n      Wright].\n\n      With discovery now complete, [Appellees] have filed Motions for\n      Summary Judgment seeking to dismiss [Appellants’] claims\n      against them.      In their [m]otions, [Appellees] assert that\n      summary judgment is warranted because the CPSL does not\n      create a private civil cause of action for violation of the reporting\n      requirements contained in 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6311 and § 6313.\n      Further, [Appellees] argue that Pennsylvania law does not\n      authorize negligence per se claims based upon violations of the\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\nengaged in the admission, examination, care or treatment of individuals” to\n“make a report of suspected child abuse . . . if the person has reasonable\ncause to suspect that a child is a victim of child abuse.” 23 Pa.C.S.\n§§ 6311(a)(1), (3). Notably, subsection 6311(b)(3) provides that “[n]othing\nin this section shall require the mandated reporter to identify the person\nresponsible for the child abuse to make a report of suspected child abuse.”\nSection 6313 directs the reporting procedure, requiring a mandated reporter\nto “immediately make an oral report of suspected child abuse to the\ndepartment via the Statewide toll-free telephone number . . . or a written\nreport using electronic technologies,” and further directs that an oral\nreporter submit a written report to the assigned department or agency\nwithin forty-eight hours.\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n      CPSL, and that there is no common[-]law duty for a physician to\n      report a reasonable suspicion of child abuse.        Additionally,\n      [Appellees] contend that, even if the [c]ourt recognizes a duty\n      for physicians to report suspected child abuse, [Appellants]\n      cannot establish that [Appellees’] conduct was the legal cause of\n      [K.H.’s] injuries. Finally, LGH asserts that [Appellants] have\n      failed to establish that they are liable for the conduct of the\n      physicians through the doctrine of ostensible agency, or that the\n      hospital engaged in corporate negligence.\n\nTrial Court Opinion (“T.C.O.”), 11/27/2013, at 2-6 (citations omitted).\n\n      After reviewing Appellees’ various arguments, the trial court entered\n\npartial summary judgment as follows:\n\n      [Appellees’] Motions are granted insofar as all of [Appellants’]\n      claims based upon [Appellees’] alleged failure to recognize, treat\n      and report reasonable suspicions of child abuse are dismissed.\n      LGH’s Motions are also granted as to [Appellants’] corporate\n      negligence claims related to the hospital’s failure to adopt\n      policies to ensure quality care for the patient and to select and\n      retain competent physicians. However, Dr. Mack, Dr. Smigocki,\n      [Lancaster Radiology] and [LGH’s] [m]otions are denied with\n      respect to any averments of negligence that are specifically\n      premised on the misinterpretation of radiological studies by\n      Drs. Mack and Smigocki, and the vicarious liability of Lancaster\n      Radiology Associations and [LGH] on these medical malpractice\n      claims.\n\nOrder, 11/27/2013, at 1-2.\n\n      The parties thereafter filed motions for reconsideration.            After\n\nreviewing the motions, the trial court entered an order denying Appellants’\n\nmotion for reconsideration, granting Appellees’ motion for reconsideration,\n\nand dismissing Appellants’ amended complaint in its entirety.     See Order,\n\n2/19/2014, at 1.   The trial court order included a footnote explaining the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\ncourt’s reversal of course as to those claims that initially survived summary\n\njudgment:\n\n      Upon further review of [Appellants’] expert reports submitted by\n      Drs. [Alan E.] Oestreich and [James] Abrahams, the [c]ourt\n      determined that, while both experts initially opine that Drs. Mack\n      and Smigocki misinterpreted [K.H.’s] radiographic studies, they\n      ultimately conclude that the only damage caused by these errors\n      was that the physicians failed to recognize and report suspected\n      child abuse.      The [c]ourt has already determined that\n      Pennsylvania law does not authorize a private cause of action\n      against a physician for failure to report suspected child abuse.\n      Accordingly, [Appellees’] Motion for Reconsideration must be\n      granted.\n\nId. at 1 n.1. The trial court’s February 19, 2014 order rendered final the\n\ncourt’s entry of summary judgment for Appellees as to all of Appellants’\n\nclaims. This timely appeal followed.\n\n      On March 18, 2014, the trial court directed Appellants to file a concise\n\nstatement   of   the   errors   complained    of   on     appeal   pursuant   to\n\nPa.R.A.P. 1925(b), and Appellants timely complied on April 8, 2014.           On\n\nApril 30, 2014, the trial court issued its Rule 1925(a) opinion, which directed\n\nthis Court’s attention to the explanations provided in its lengthy November\n\n27, 2013 opinion, which coincided with its initial order entering partial\n\nsummary judgment.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n      Appellants raise the following issues for review:\n\n      1.    Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n      summary judgment in favor of [Appellees] on purely legal issues\n      that had been decided in favor of [Appellants] on preliminary\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n       objections by a judge of coordinate jurisdiction where no new\n       law or evidence was presented?\n\n       2      Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n       summary judgment in favor of [Appellees] on [Appellants’]\n       legally cognizable claims for professional medical negligence\n       based on [Appellees’] departure from the applicable standard of\n       care where [Appellants] established a duty based on the\n       [Appellees’] admissions and expert opinions?\n\n       3.    Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n       summary judgment on [Appellants’] anticipated request for a\n       negligence per se jury instruction at trial?\n\n       4.    Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n       summary judgment in favor of [Appellees] where the record\n       contained more than adequate evidence, including multiple\n       expert reports, demonstrating [that Appellees’] medical\n       negligence increased the risk of harm to [K.H.]?\n\n       5.     Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n       summary judgment in favor of [LGH] on [Appellants’] claims for\n       corporate negligence where the record contained more than\n       sufficient evidence that [LGH] failed to have appropriate policies\n       in place for the retention and availability of patients’ prior\n       radiology studies, and failed to have adequately trained,\n       experienced, and qualified physicians to read pediatric\n       radiographs?\n\nBrief for Appellants at 4-5 (footnote omitted).3\n\n       A.     The Coordinate Jurisdiction Doctrine Does Not Preclude\n              the Trial Court from Granting Summary Judgment.\n\n       Appellants’ first issue is the easiest to resolve, requiring only brief\n\ndiscussion. As noted, supra, the trial court’s entry of summary judgment for\n\nAppellees hinged principally, perhaps exclusively, upon the proposition that\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3\n      Issues two and four overlap sufficiently that we will consider them\ntogether as Appellants’ second issue.\n\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nAppellants’ claims, however denominated, amounted to claims for civil relief\n\nfor violations of the CPSL’s reporting obligations. In effect, Appellants argue\n\nthat Judge Reinaker, the first judge assigned this case, conclusively decided\n\nthis issue in their favor.    Consequently, the coordinate jurisdiction rule\n\nbarred Judge Wright, to whom the matter later was assigned, from granting\n\nsummary judgment for Appellees. We disagree.\n\n      Our Supreme Court has described the coordinate jurisdiction rule as\n\nfollows:\n\n      Generally, the coordinate jurisdiction rule commands that[,]\n      upon transfer of a matter between trial judges of coordinate\n      jurisdiction, a transferee trial judge may not alter resolution of a\n      legal question previously decided by a transferor trial judge.\n      More simply stated, judges of coordinate jurisdiction should not\n      overrule each other’s decisions.\n\n      The reason for this respect for an equal tribunal’s decision . . . is\n      that the coordinate jurisdiction rule is based on a policy of\n      fostering the finality of pre-trial applications in an effort to\n      maintain judicial economy and efficiency. Furthermore, . . . the\n      coordinate jurisdiction rule serves to protect the expectations of\n      the parties, to [e]nsure uniformity of decisions, to maintain\n      consistency in proceedings, to effectuate the administration of\n      justice, and to bring finality to the litigation.\n\nZane v. Friends Hosp., 836 A.2d 25, 29 (Pa. 2003) (citations modified;\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The trial court addressed this issue only briefly in its Rule 1925(a)\n\nopinion, rejecting Appellants’ argument by reference to this Court’s decision\n\nin Salerno v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., 546 A.2d 1168, 1170\n\n(Pa. Super. 1988). In Salerno, this Court made the following observations:\n\n\n\n                                     - 11 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n      [The coordinate jurisdiction rule] is not intended to preclude\n      granting summary judgment following denial of preliminary\n      objections. “The failure to present a cause of action upon which\n      relief can be granted may be raised at any time. A motion for\n      summary judgment is based not only upon the averments of the\n      pleadings but may also consider discovery depositions, answers\n      to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits.”        Austin J.\n      Richards, Inc., v. McClafferty, 538 A.2d 11, 14-15 n.1\n      (Pa. Super. 1988). We can discern no reason for prohibiting the\n      consideration and granting of a summary judgment if the record\n      as it then stands warrants such action.        Cf. DiAndrea v.\n      Reliance S.&L. Ass’n, 456 A.2d 1066, 1069 (Pa. Super. 1983).\n      This is particularly true when the preliminary objections were\n      denied without an opinion. Farber v. Engle, 525 A.2d 864\n      (Pa. Cmwlth. 1987).\n\nSalerno, 546 A.2d at 1170 (citations modified).\n\n      Appellants counterpose, inter alia, our Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nGoldey v. Trustees of Univ. of Penna., 675 A.2d 264 (Pa. 1996). In this\n\nCourt’s decision preceding the Supreme Court’s review, we appeared to\n\nexpand Salerno’s reliance upon the lack of trial judge opinion in connection\n\nwith denying preliminary objections to a far broader spectrum of motions\n\nand procedural contexts.     This Court’s ruling to that effect, our Supreme\n\nCourt observed, “stretched far beyond the exception stated in Salerno,\n\nwhich was grounded in the differences between preliminary objections and\n\nsummary judgment motions.”        Goldey, 675 A.2d at 267.        The Supreme\n\nCourt, emphasizing that the “presence or absence of an opinion in support of\n\nthe initial ruling is not controlling,” held without qualification that, “[w]here\n\nthe motions differ in kind, as preliminary objections differ from motions for\n\njudgment on the pleadings, which differ from motions for summary\n\n\n\n                                     - 12 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\njudgment, a judge ruling on a later motion is not precluded from granting\n\nrelief although another judge has denied an earlier motion.” Id.\n\n       Appellants seek to distinguish Salerno from the instant case on the\n\nbasis that, in the instant case, the record relevant to the purely legal issues\n\nraised on summary judgment before Judge Wright was no more expansive\n\nthan the record as it appeared to Judge Reinaker when he overruled\n\nAppellees’ preliminary objections.             Brief for Appellants at 27.   For this\n\nreason, Appellants argue that the procedural context is immaterial, because\n\nthe spirit of the coordinate jurisdiction rule was violated when the trial court\n\naccepted these arguments after they were rejected earlier by a different\n\njudge. Id. at 27-28.\n\n       In the strongest of the Appellees’ various briefs on this subject, 4\n\nAppellee Dr. Devenyi cites, inter alia, Mellon Bank, N.A., v. National\n\nUnion Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, PA, 768 A.2d 865 (Pa. Super. 2001),\n\nas controlling authority. Brief for Dr. Devenyi, AO Pediatric Associates, Inc.,\n\nand Dr. Avallone at 11-12 (“Brief for Devenyi”).            In that case, one judge\n\noverruled preliminary objections asserted on the basis that the claimant in\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4\n       In sum, this Court is confronted with seventeen briefs—Appellants’\nprimary brief, eight responsive briefs by Appellees, and Appellants’ reply\nbrief to each responsive brief. In the discussion that follows, references to\nindividual Appellees’ arguments will occur only rarely, because their\narguments tend to be shared, incorporated by reference, or materially the\nsame. Except when circumstances warrant otherwise, we will simply refer to\n“Appellees’” arguments.\n\n\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nthat case was not an insured, and did not provide an explanatory opinion.\n\nLater, when the same issue was raised before a different judge in a motion\n\nfor summary judgment that did not present any new evidence in support of\n\ndismissal, this Court, citing Goldey, held that the differing nature of the two\n\nmotions sufficed to preclude application of the coordinate jurisdiction rule.\n\n      We agree that Mellon Bank is controlling. Consequently, we find it\n\nimmaterial whether, in fact, the decisional record on summary judgment\n\nbefore Judge Wright varied at all from what Judge Reinaker had at his\n\ndisposal in reviewing Appellees’ preliminary objections.        Under Mellon\n\nBank, the procedural context alone precludes application of the coordinate\n\njurisdiction rule.   Accordingly, we reject Appellants’ argument that Judge\n\nWright was barred from granting Appellees summary judgment by Judge\n\nReinaker’s prior contrary ruling in the context of preliminary objections.\n\n      B.    Appellants Do Not Seek to Establish a Civil Cause of\n            Action Under the CPSL.\n\n      In taking up the questions presented as issues two and four, we\n\ncannot address whether Appellants set forth a prima facie case of medical\n\nmalpractice in various particulars before first addressing the trial court’s and\n\nAppellees’ conclusions that Appellants seek relief that necessarily sounds in\n\na putative civil violation of the CPSL, a statute that expressly provides only\n\ncriminal sanctions against physicians who “willfully” fail to comply with its\n\nterms. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 6319(a)(1). The trial court ruled that the absence\n\nof an express provision in the CPSL providing for such a claim necessarily\n\n\n                                     - 14 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nsignals the exclusion of any civil cause of action based upon a failure to\n\nreport child abuse, requiring dismissal of all of Appellants’ claims.\n\n       Only Appellee Regional Gastroenterology Associates of Lancaster—in a\n\nmere two sentences—addresses this issue in the terms that we find\n\nconclusive:     “In their Brief, Appellants concede that the [CPSL] does not\n\ncreate    a   private    cause     of   action       against   Appellees.         [Regional\n\nGastroenterology]       accepts      this      concession.”       Brief     for   Regional\n\nGastroenterology at 2. We agree.5\n\n       That being said, Appellees’ arguments suggest that Appellants’ claims,\n\neven if framed as common-law medical malpractice, necessarily depend\n\nupon the existence of a civil remedy under the CPSL.                Appellees in effect\n\nassert that Appellants may not obtain the benefit of their artful pleading in\n\nseeking to invent a private cause of action that the legislature implicitly\n\ndeclined to create.      Notably, Appellees offer no controlling or entirely on-\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5\n      Appellants unnecessarily complicate their own position by suggesting\nthat Regional Gastroenterology’s assertion that Appellants concede the\nmatter “misses the point.” Reply Brief of Appellants to Brief of Regional\nGastroenterology at 2 (unnumbered). Appellants elaborate that, “[w]hile\nthe CPSL may not include an express private cause of action, [Appellants]\nhave not sought to recover under the statutory provisions of the CPSL.” Id.\nThis strikes us as a distinction without a difference. In any event, even if\nAppellants did not disavow any such claim, we would find it waived for want\nof argument in support of such a position. See Commonwealth v. Veon,\n109 A.3d 754, 774 (Pa. Super. 2015) (deeming an issue waived under\nPa.R.A.P. 2119(a) because the appellant failed to provide a “properly\ndeveloped argument”).\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 15 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\npoint case law establishing the necessity of construing Appellants’ claims in\n\nthis fashion.     Furthermore, the CPSL does not expressly preclude civil\n\nliability for a failure to report abuse, nor immunize those who fail in their\n\nreporting obligations.\n\n       Consequently, for purposes of determining whether Appellants have\n\nstated a prima facie case of medical malpractice or negligence, we think it\n\nmost useful to evaluate the adequacy of Appellants’ showing in this regard\n\nas though the CPSL simply does not exist. Appellants claim not to rely upon\n\nit, and we find no reason in Pennsylvania law not to treat their asserted\n\ncommon-law claims as such.            If Appellants’ claims cannot stand without\n\nreference to the CPSL, our analysis would reveal that flaw. However, we do\n\nnot find that to be the case.\n\n       C.     Appellants Have Set Forth a Prima Facie Case of Medical\n              Malpractice.\n\n       We begin with the time-honored characterization of the standard that\n\ngoverns common-law medical malpractice claims:6\n\n       [W]hen a plaintiff’s medical            malpractice claim sounds in\n       negligence, the elements of the         plaintiff’s case are the same as\n       those in ordinary negligence             actions.     As such, medical\n       malpractice can be broadly              defined as the unwarranted\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6\n      At times, Appellants refer to their claims as ordinary negligence and in\nothers as sounding in medical malpractice. However, the substance of their\nclaims consists of assertions consistent with medical malpractice, and we\ntreat them exclusively as such. See Grossman v. Barke, 868 A.2d 561,\n566 (Pa. Super. 2005) (analyzing claims stated as ordinary negligence under\nthe standards governing medical malpractice).\n\n\n\n                                          - 16 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n     departure from generally accepted standards of medical practice\n     resulting in injury to the patient, including all liability-producing\n     conduct arising from the rendition of professional medical\n     services. Thus, to prevail in a medical malpractice action, a\n     plaintiff must establish a duty owed by the physician to the\n     patient, a breach of that duty by the physician, that the breach\n     was the proximate cause of the harm suffered, and [that] the\n     damages suffered were a direct result of the harm.\n\nToogood v. Owen J. Rogal, D.D.S., P.C., 824 A.2d 1140, 1145 (Pa. 2003)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see Grossman v. Barke ,\n\n868 A.2d 561, 566 (Pa. Super. 2005).\n\n     “Whether a duty of care exists in any given set of circumstances is a\n\nquestion of law.” Winschel v. Jain, 925 A.2d 782, 796 (Pa. Super. 2007).\n\nHowever, provided the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of a duty, the\n\nstandard of care and the defendant’s satisfaction of that standard are\n\nquestions of fact to be submitted to a jury. Joyce v. Blvd. Phys. Therapy\n\n& Rehab. Ctr., P.C., 694 A.2d 648, 654-55 (Pa. Super. 1997).\n\n        1.    Appellees owed the general duty of care to K.H.\n              that    arises  in    the    physician-patient\n              relationship.\n\n     Our Supreme Court has spoken eloquently of the nature of the duty\n\nowed by any one person to another:\n\n     In determining the existence of a duty of care, it must be\n     remembered that the concept of duty amounts to no more than\n     the sum total of those considerations of policy which led the law\n     to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection from\n     the harm suffered. . . . To give it any greater mystique would\n     unduly hamper our system of jurisprudence in adjusting to the\n     changing times. The late Dean Prosser expressed this view as\n     follows:\n\n\n                                    - 17 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n        These are shifting sands, and no fit foundation. There is a\n        duty if the court says there is a duty; the law, like the\n        Constitution, is what we make it. Duty is only a word with\n        which we state our conclusion that there is or is not to be\n        liability; it necessarily begs the essential question. When\n        we find a duty, breach and damage, everything has been\n        said.     The word serves a useful purpose in directing\n        attention to the obligation to be imposed upon the\n        defendant, rather than the causal sequence of events;\n        beyond that it serves none. In the decision whether or not\n        there is a duty, many factors interplay: [t]he hand of\n        history, our ideas of morals and justice, the convenience of\n        administration of the rule, and our social ideas as to where\n        the loss should fall. In the end the court will decide\n        whether there is a duty on the basis of the mores of the\n        community, always keeping in mind the fact that we\n        endeavor to make a rule in each case that will be practical\n        and in keeping with the general understanding of mankind.\n\n     Sinn v. Burd, 404 A.2d 672, 681 (Pa. 1979) (citations omitted).\n\nAlthaus v. Cohen, 756 A.2d 1166, 1169 (Pa. 2000) (emphasis added;\n\ncitations modified); see Thierfelder v. Wolfert, 52 A.3d 1251, 1265\n\n(Pa. 2012).\n\n     The following overarching principle, which adapts the broader notion of\n\nduty to the context of medical malpractice, is enshrined in many decades of\n\nour case law:\n\n     Duty is measured against the standard of care appropriate to the\n     training of the physician and the time and place of the\n     treatment. Our Supreme Court has explained the standard of\n     care appropriate to a non-specialist physician as follows:\n\n        The standard of care required of a physician . . . is well-\n        settled . . . . A physician who is not a specialist is required\n        to possess and employ in the treatment of a patient the\n        skill and knowledge usually possessed by physicians in the\n        same or a similar locality, giving due regard to the\n        advanced state of the profession at the time of the\n        treatment; and in employing the required skill and\n\n                                    - 18 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n         knowledge he is also required to exercise the care and\n         judgment of a reasonable man.\n\n      Joyce, 694 A.2d at 654 (quoting Donaldson v. Maffucci, 156\n      A.2d 835, 838 (Pa. 1959))\n\nWinschel, 925 A.2d at 796-97 (citations modified).\n\n      A specialist acting within his or her specialty . . . is held to a\n      higher standard; he or she is expected to exercise that degree of\n      skill, learning and care normally possessed and exercised by the\n      average physician who devotes special study and attention to\n      the diagnosis and treatment of diseases within the specialty.\n\nMaurer    v.   Trustees    of   Univ.   of    Penna.,   614   A.2d   754,   758\n\n(Pa. Super. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The trial court began its discussion of Appellants’ common-law claims\n\nas follows:\n\n      As a general rule, under Pennsylvania law, a person is not liable\n      for the criminal conduct of a third party. Feld v. Merriam, 485\n      A.2d 742, 756 (Pa. 1984). Moreover, it is axiomatic that there is\n      no duty to control the conduct of a third person to prevent him\n      from causing physical harm to another unless (a) a special\n      relationship exists between the actor and third person’s conduct,\n      or (b) a special relationship exists between the actor and the\n      other which gives the other a right to protection. Emerich v.\n      Phila. Ctr. for Human Dev., Inc., 720 A.2d 1032, 1036\n      (Pa. 1998). . . . Absent a special relationship, the duty that one\n      person owes to another is “the general duty imposed upon all\n      persons not to expose others to risk of injury which are\n      reasonably foreseeable[.”] Schmoyer v. Mexico Forge, Inc.,\n      649 A.2d 705, 708 (Pa. Super. 1994).\n\nT.C.O. at 18 (citations modified).\n\n      The trial court relied exclusively upon a Georgia decision to support its\n\nfinding that no relevant duty arose under the circumstances of this case.\n\n\n\n                                     - 19 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nSpecifically, the trial court deemed “persuasive” the Court of Appeals of\n\nGeorgia’s decision in Cechman v. Travis, in which that court, faced with\n\nclaims materially identical to those at bar, found no common-law duty on the\n\npart of the physician to discover and report a case of possible child abuse.\n\nT.C.O. at 19 (citing Cechman, 414 S.E.2d 282, 285 (Ga. Ct. App. 1991)).\n\nBut see First Comm’l Trust Co. v. Rank, 915 S.W.2d 262, 267-68\n\n(Ark. 1996) (rejecting Cechman and noting that physician’s attorney\n\nconceded that common-law medical malpractice claim may lie for failure to\n\nreport).\n\n      We find the trial court’s resort to Cechman unconvincing.                 In\n\nconnection with duty, we are confronted with a trial court decision and\n\narguments by the Appellees reflecting an essential misapprehension by the\n\ntrial court and the Appellees, one that perhaps descends from many cases in\n\nwhich the distinction between duty and standard of care has been blurred\n\nwithout consequence when properly separating the two was less critical than\n\nit is in this case. Stated specifically and in brief, the trial court and Appellees\n\neffectively maintain that the question of duty must be stated in the\n\nparticular terms of the case presented. Thus, in the absence of an express\n\ncommon-law “duty” specifically to report suspected child abuse that has\n\nbeen recited in a prior controlling precedent, such a claim categorically is\n\nunavailable. However, to define the relevant duty in this case in that fashion\n\nimproperly imports into the duty inquiry questions pertaining to whether a\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 20 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nduty was breached, which is a question of fact as to which Appellants\n\npresented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n       In most cases, this distinction will be of little import, which is why our\n\nmedical malpractice case law tends to lack discussions that clearly segregate\n\nthese inquiries.       However, disentangling these principles is critical to\n\nresolving the issue presented: If the question is simply whether Appellees\n\nowed K.H., as their patient, a duty of reasonable care, then the necessity of\n\na duty clearly is satisfied. As our case law makes clear, a physician must\n\n“possess and employ in the treatment of a patient the skill and knowledge\n\nusually possessed by physicians in the same or a similar locality, giving due\n\nregard to the advanced state of the profession at the time of the treatment”\n\nand “is also required to exercise the care and judgment of a reasonable\n\nman.” Winschel, 925 A.2d at 196-97. However, if, as the trial court and\n\nAppellees maintain, the question is whether Appellees had a specific duty to\n\nreport suspicions of abuse, the absence of case law establishing such a duty\n\nlends at least some credence to Appellees’ claims that to vindicate\n\nAppellants’ view would create an entirely new form of liability, which this\n\nCourt does not regularly do.7\n____________________________________________\n\n\n7\n      Although ultimately we find this argument immaterial to our analysis,\nthe mere recognition of a viable basis for a tort claim that has not previously\nbeen presented to Pennsylvania courts should not be fatal per se to such a\nclaim. As the Minnesota Supreme Court observed in Becker v. Mayo\nFoundation, 737 N.W.2d 200 (Minn. 2007), the “[n]ovelty of an asserted\nright and lack of common-law precedent are no reasons for denying its\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                          - 21 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n      Although we find the relevant principle in the above-cited cases,\n\nPennsylvania law is not a paragon of clarity in distinguishing duty from\n\nstandard of care.        Nonetheless, additional suggestions as to the correct\n\nanswer are found in the above cases and others.                 In Pratt v. Stein,\n\n444 A.2d 674 (Pa. Super. 1982), for example, we held that a physician’s\n\nduty to a patient is simply the “exercise [of] reasonable medical care,”\n\nwithout importing into that question of duty the precise contours of what\n\ncare was appropriate under the circumstances of that case.              Rather, we\n\naddressed the particular standard of care and the doctor’s satisfaction\n\nthereof as a question of fact.           Id. at 705.    And in Ervin v. American\n\nGuardian Life Assurance Co., 545 A.2d 354 (Pa. Super. 1988), this Court\n\nheld that a cardiologist retained by an insurance company to review an\n\ninsured’s electrocardiogram did not owe the claimant a duty that would\n\nsupport a medical malpractice action.            In so doing, we favorably quoted a\n\nMichigan decision to the effect that, where the claimant did not seek medical\n\nadvice or treatment from the defendant, the physician lacked the duty that\n\nattaches to such a relationship.          Id. at 356 (quoting Rogers v. Horvath,\n\n237 N.W.2d 595, 596-97 (Mich. Ct. App. 1976)).8\n\n\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\nexistence.     The common law does not consist of absolute, fixed, and\ninflexible rules. Its principles have been determined by the social needs of\nthe community and have changed with changes in such needs.” Id. at 216.\n8\n       The Michigan Supreme Court later abrogated Rogers, holding that an\nindependent medical examiner owes a limited duty to the subject of his\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                           - 22 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n      Perhaps most interestingly, just last year this Court reaffirmed a\n\nlimited duty on the part of a physician to certain third parties in the\n\ntreatment of a patient with a communicable disease.             Our decision was\n\ncouched in the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 324A (“Liability to Third\n\nPerson for Negligent Performance of Undertaking”), which provides that\n\n“[o]ne who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services\n\nto another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a\n\nthird person . . ., is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm\n\nresulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care . . . .”      Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 324A.          We noted that the “original undertaking,” i.e.,\n\n“entry into the physician-patient relationship for treatment purposes,”\n\nimposed upon the physician “the duty to exercise reasonable care.”\n\nMatharu v. Muir, 86 A.3d 250, 259 (Pa. Super. 2014) (quoting Seebold v.\n\nPrison Health Servs., Inc., 57 A.3d 1232, 1244-45 (Pa. 2012)).\n\n      Comparing these cases’ accounts of what general duty a physician\n\nowes to a patient to certain intrinsic principles of medical malpractice claims\n\npoints to the proper approach to separating a physician’s duty from his\n\nstandard of care. First, as noted, supra, the duty inquiry is a pure question\n\nof law. Consequently, it is for the court in the first instance to determine\n\nwithout jury consideration whether a duty attaches under the circumstances\n\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\nexamination that is consistent with his professional training and expertise.\nSee Dyer v. Trachtman, 679 N.W.2d 311 (Mich. 2004).\n\n\n\n                                           - 23 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nof the case before it.       However, we also have made clear that in all but\n\nextraordinary cases, establishing the applicable standard of care, or if one\n\nprefers, the contours of the general duty recognized in the first instance by\n\nthe court, requires expert testimony and presents a question of fact for the\n\njury. Joyce, 694 A.2d at 654-55. If we allow the trial court to import into\n\nthe duty inquiry a determination as to the precise standard of care at issue,\n\nand implicitly to decide on summary judgment that the standard has not\n\nbeen breached, we take from the jury its prescribed role in medical\n\nmalpractice cases.       The integrity of the time-honored delineation of what\n\nbelongs to the court and what belongs to the jury can be preserved only by\n\nseparating a physician’s general duty to his patient, the formulation of\n\nwhich arises simply from the inception of any physician-patient relationship,\n\nfrom the elucidation of how that duty is to be fulfilled in a given case, which\n\nconcerns the particular standard of care, and whether the defendant did so.\n\nThe latter inquiries require a jury determination. See id.9\n____________________________________________\n\n\n9\n       Even as they argue for the expanded account of what duty a trial court\nmust find as a matter of law before a case may proceed, Appellees LGH and\nDr. Kumar elsewhere appear to concede that the inquiry properly proceeds\nfrom the threshold question of law on to trial and jury consideration as we\nexplain herein. LGH, for example, notes that “a duty exists, as recognized\nby law as created by the physician/patient relationship, that requires the\nphysician to act in accordance with specific norms or standards established\nby the profession, commonly referred to as the standard of care.” Brief\nfor LGH at 20 (emphasis in original). LGH then notes that, “if no care is due,\nit is meaningless to assert that a person failed to act with due care.” Id.\n(quoting Elbasher v. Simco Sales Serv. of Penna., 657 A.2d 983, 984-85\n(Pa. Super. 1995)). See Brief for Kumar at 36-37 (noting that “[w]hether a\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                          - 24 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n      In light of this account, it is clear that the trial court conflated the\n\nbroader inquiry into Appellees’ duties into one inflected by the case- and\n\nphysician-specific standard of care, the determination of which is reserved\n\nfor the jury. This error led the court to conclude that no common-law claim\n\nfor a failure to report would lie, when, in fact, the common-law claim that\n\nwas asserted is (or may be) merely a species of medical malpractice, albeit\n\none infrequently invoked, requiring expert testimony sufficient to enable a\n\njury to conclude that the standard of care applicable to Appellees in this case\n\nentailed an obligation to report suspicions of child abuse.          Appellants\n\nestablished Appellees’ general duty as soon as they established the\n\nundisputed physician-patient relationship between K.H. and all of the\n\nAppellees in this case. Thus, we now must consider whether Appellants set\n\nforth sufficient evidence as to each of the remaining elements of a medical\n\nmalpractice claim to establish a prima facie case for medical malpractice.\n\n          2.    Appellants set forth a prima facie case that\n                Appellees breached their respective duties to\n                K.H.\n\n      Having established the threshold duty that K.H.’s healthcare providers\n\nowed him as a consequence of the physician-patient relationship, we turn\n\n\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\nphysician is performing his duty . . . is established by the profession of which\nthe physician is a member,” but stating that “[e]xperts do not establish\nwhether a duty exists,” and conceding that Dr. Kumar had a duty to\nexamine, diagnose, and treat K.H.).\n\n\n\n\n                                           - 25 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nnow to the question of breach. Because we review Appellants’ proffer in the\n\nlight most favorable to Appellants, we must consider whether their evidence\n\n(a) could lead a jury reasonably to conclude that Appellees’ standards of\n\ncare entailed obligations to form and/or report suspicions of abuse, and\n\n(b) establishes a basis upon which a jury reasonably could conclude that\n\nAppellants failed to meet their respective standards of care.\n\n            (a)   Appellants’ evidence creates a genuine\n                  issue of material fact regarding whether\n                  Appellees’ standard of care imposed upon\n                  them a reporting obligation.\n\n      Under the circumstances of this case, establishing the applicable\n\nstandard of care for a general practitioner or a specialist generally requires\n\nexpert testimony.   See Donaldson, 156 A.2d at 838; Maurer, 614 A.2d\n\nat 758.   Typically, “[a] plaintiff [must] present an expert witness who will\n\ntestify, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the acts of the\n\nphysician deviated from good and acceptable medical standards . . . .”\n\nMitzelfelt v.

Consequently, the only question is whether\n\nAppellants provided expert evidence that defined a standard of care\n\nrequiring reporting to a reasonable degree of medical certainty and asserted\n\na breach thereof with respect to each Appellee.             Appellants provided\n\nvoluminous evidence to precisely that effect.\n____________________________________________\n\n\n10\n      Here, too, it is clear that determining the standard of care is a task\nfirmly ensconced with the jury, not the court under the guise of satisfying\nthe threshold question of whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff.\n11\n       With the enactment of Pennsylvania’s Medical Care Availability and\nReduction of Error Act (“MCARE”), 40 P.S. §§ 1303.101, et seq., additional\nmandatory qualifying criteria were imposed upon the introduction of such\nexpert testimony. Because the parties to this matter do not dispute the\nqualifications of Appellants’ experts, the MCARE restrictions, which merely\nreinforce and give shape to the common-law expert testimony requirement\nthat preceded MCARE’s May 20, 2002 effective date, are not at issue.\n\n\n\n                                          - 27 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n     Eli H. Newberger, M.D., a board-certified pediatrician, Assistant\n\nProfessor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, and Adjunct in Pediatrics\n\nat Childen’s Hospital of Boston, rendered a lengthy report that touched upon\n\nthe standard of care governing Appellees, reviewed at length the medical\n\nhistory and records documenting Appellees’ treatment of K.H., and expressly\n\nrendered his opinions as to the standard of care and each physician’s\n\nindividual failures to satisfy that standard “to a reasonabl[e] degree of\n\nmedical certainty.”   Report of Eli H. Newberger, M.D., 7/8/2013, at 2, 23,\n\nattached as Exh. FF to Appellants’ Omnibus Memorandum of Law In\n\nOpposition to All Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (“Appellants’\n\nOmnibus Memorandum”), 9/27/2013 (hereinafter “Newberger Report”).\n\n     Dr. Newberger’s account of the standard of care was as follows:\n\n     As a matter of background, Pennsylvania’s child reporting\n     statute was harmonized with the model developed by the\n     American Bar Association commission on which I served in the\n     mid-1970’s.      Pursuant to the 1973 Federal Child Abuse\n     Prevention and Treatment Act, prior to their receiving their\n     monetary shares of the Congressional budgetary allocation for\n     the National Child Abuse Center in the Department of Health,\n     Education, and Welfare, states were required to conform their\n     reporting standards to the Federal model. The threshold for\n     reporting—reasonable cause or suspicion—was intentionally set\n     low in order to assure that children would be protected from\n     subsequent, more severe injuries than those initially reported.\n     Infant injuries and their frequently fatal or lasting consequences\n     were a particular focus of concern, and a national training\n     initiative assured that the reporting requirements and their\n     rationale were built into the training of medical students,\n     primary care physicians, and especially, pediatricians. Thus, the\n     standard of care for physicians in recognition and\n     reporting of child abuse has been incorporated into the\n     reporting statutes.\n\n                                   - 28 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nNewberger Report at 2 (emphasis added).12\n\n       Similarly, David Turkewitz, M.D., a board-certified pediatrician and,\n\ninter alia, Chairman of Pediatrics at York Hospital in York, Pennsylvania,\n\nDirector of Section Pediatric Emergency Medicine of the Department of\n\nEmergency Medicine,13 and clinical professor of pediatrics at Pennsylvania\n\nState University, averred that, “[i]n order to comply with the standard of\n\ncare a physician, particular[ly] a pediatrician, must appropriately recognize\n\nsigns and symptoms of abuse, diagnose that abuse, and report that abuse.”\n\nReport of David Turkewitz, M.D., undated, at 2, attached as Exh. HH to\n\nAppellants’    Omnibus       Memorandum        (hereinafter   “Turkewitz   Report”).\n\nDr. Turkewitz elaborated as follows:\n\n       [T]he obligation to report a suspicion of child abuse is the\n       standard of care governing any physician. This duty is also\n       mandated by statute in Pennsylvania (and elsewhere).       A\n____________________________________________\n\n\n12\n       The language emphasized in this passage and those that immediately\nfollow is important because, as worded, it suggests that the standard of care\nexisted separately from, and was later baked into, the model law upon which\nthe CPSL is founded, not that the statute supplied or supplanted the\nstandard of care. Moreover, no authority of which we are aware suggests\nthat, when a statute overlaps or is in conformity with a common-law\nstandard of care, or vice-versa, that standard of care no longer governs the\nphysician’s conduct independently of the statute. Even when they entirely\noverlap, the different standards of proof governing criminal and civil claims\nfor failure to report suggest otherwise: Under medical malpractice, a\nplaintiff need only establish a negligent breach of the standard of care by a\npreponderance of the evidence, while criminal liability, even for the same\nalleged conduct, requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a “willful”\nfailure to report.\n13\n       This title is per Dr. Turkewitz’s curriculum vitae.\n\n\n\n                                          - 29 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n       reasonable suspicion of abuse is exactly that: if after analysis of\n       decision[-]making components, there is a reasonable suspicion\n       of abuse, then the physician has a duty to report under\n       Pennsylvania mandating reporting requirements which is\n       encompassed in the standard of care. Reasonable suspicion\n       by no means requires a high degree of medical certainty. The\n       threshold for reporting is purposely set low to encourage\n       reporting of child abuse and to ensure children are protected\n       from additional abuse which can lead to further injury or death.\n       The goal is simple—protection of the child. . . . All physicians, in\n       accordance with the standard of care, must therefore\n       appropriately appreciate, assess, diagnose, and report signs and\n       symptoms of abuse.\n\nId. at 3 (emphasis added).14\n\n       In light of this expert evidence, it would be untenable to suggest that\n\nAppellants failed to adduce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding whether Appellees’ standard of care obligated them\n\nto report reasonable suspicions of child abuse to the appropriate authorities,\n\nindependently of a similar statutory obligation.\n\n              (b)    Appellants’ evidence raises a genuine\n                     issue of material fact regarding whether\n                     Appellees    breached    the   governing\n                     standard of care.\n\n       We now move on to review Appellants’ experts’ opinions regarding\n\neach Appellee-physician’s performance under the standard of care.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n14\n      Without exception, the other experts cited below, who are cited, infra,\nas attesting that one or more Appellees breached the standard of care,\nsimilarly aver that the standard of care imposes a reporting obligation\nindependently of the statute requiring same.

While she should have reported on September\n     12, 2002, each new injury thereafter provided even more reason\n     to report, and her failure to act in accordance with the standard\n     of care in assessment, diagnosis, and reporting of child abuse\n     served not only to deny this child the protection that he needed\n     and deserved, but enabled his abuser to continue to harm him.\n     Dr. Kumar was at the core of over three months of escalating\n     injuries to [K.H.] that were all suspicious of [sic] an ongoing\n     pattern of abuse to the child, as well as concerns by several\n     other physicians for abuse. Despite this, Dr. Kumar did nothing\n     to protect the child from further abuse and actually defended\n     against allegations of abuse by other physicians. This was a\n     gross deviation from the standard of care that had catastrophic\n     consequences of additional and more severe abuse that rendered\n     [K.H.] neurologically devastated.\n\nNewberger Report at 22; see Report of Herschel R.

RR to\n\nAppellants’ Omnibus Memorandum; Turkewitz Report.\n\n     More than enough expert testimony was presented by Appellants to\n\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact regarding the nature of the relevant\n\n\n                                   - 33 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\ngeneral and specialist standards of care, independently of the CPSL, as well\n\nas whether each Appellee conformed to those that applied to him or her or\n\nbreached the standard, and, in so doing, his or her duty to K.H.15\n\nAccordingly, we turn to Appellants’ evidence in support of damages and\n\ncausation.\n\n          3.     Appellants have provided ample evidence to\n                 raise a jury question with respect to damages.\n\n       Because the adequacy of Appellants’ proffered expert evidence\n\nregarding the nature and scope of Appellants’ damages has not been\n\nchallenged on appeal, it is not necessary to address this issue at length. In\n\nthe interests of comprehensiveness, we simply note that Appellants\n____________________________________________\n\n\n15\n       Appellees make much of the proposition that they had no duty to third\nparties, or to control third parties. However, it is clearly the case that the\nduty asserted by Appellants was Appellees’ duty to K.H., which, at least in\nits broadest strokes, cannot be disputed. Appellees also argue at length that\ntheir duty extends only to diagnosis and treatment, and does not reach any\nobligation to report, a proposition flatly contradicted by several of\nAppellants’ experts. See, e.g., Brief for Smigocki at 31-33. Moreover, other\ncases, albeit distinguishable in various particulars, have established that a\nphysician’s duty to a patient or, in certain narrow circumstances, to a third\nparty, may reach outside the examination room. See Emerich, 720 A.2d\n1032 (holding that a mental health professional has a duty to warn a third\nparty of a patient’s threat to harm the third party); DiMarco v.Lynch\nHomes—Chester County, Inc., 583 A.2d 422 (Pa. 1990) (permitting suit\nagainst physician by a third party who contracts a communicable disease\nwhen third party establishes that he contracted disease due to physician’s\nerroneous advice to patient). Thus, it is clear that the precise scope of a\nphysician’s duty to a patient (and to others) is more complex than any of\nAppellees’ arguments would allow, and can be extended to matters affecting\nthe public interest that fall outside the narrow bounds of diagnosis and\ntreatment of the maladies presented by a given patient.\n\n\n\n                                          - 34 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nfurnished several reports from qualified experts attesting in detail to the\n\nnecessities of K.H.’s ongoing care, K.H.’s medical prognosis, and the costs\n\nAppellants will incur in attending to his needs.       See Report of David L.\n\nHopkins,    7/8/2013,   attached    as   Exh.   III   to   Appellant’s   Omnibus\n\nMemorandum (actuarial cost estimate); Report of B.A. McGettigan, R.N.,\n\n7/7/2013, attached as Exh. GGG to Appellants’ Omnibus Memorandum\n\n(home care analysis and cost estimate); Reports of Thomas Rugino, M.D.,\n\n12/8/2012, 7/6/2013, and 7/8/2013, Attached respectively as Exhs. XX, YY,\n\nand ZZ to Appellants’ Omnibus Memorandum (medical analysis and\n\nprognosis).\n\n           4.   Appellants’ evidence raises a genuine issue of\n                material fact regarding whether Appellees’\n                alleged breach of their respective standards of\n                care caused K.H.’s damages.\n\n      We now examine whether Appellants provided a prima facie showing\n\nthat Appellees’ alleged breaches of the applicable standards of care caused\n\nK.H.’s injuries. The trial court did not believe so, reasoning as follows:\n\n      [E]ven if [Appellees] owed a duty to [K.H.] to report a\n      reasonable suspicion that he was a victim of abuse, under the\n      circumstances of this case there is insufficient evidence of\n      causation for [Appellants’] negligence claims to proceed. In a\n      medical malpractice suit for negligence, the expert testimony\n      requirement “means that a plaintiff must present medical expert\n      testimony to establish that the care and treatment of the plaintiff\n      by the defendant fell short of the required standards of care and\n      that the breach proximately caused the plaintiff’s injury.”\n      Toogood, 824 A.2d at 1145. . . . An expert may not base his\n      opinion regarding causation on mere speculation or conjecture.\n      Instead,\n\n\n                                     - 35 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n         [w]hen a party must prove causation through expert\n         testimony[,] the expert must testify with “reasonable\n         certainty” that “in his professional opinion, the result in\n         question did come from the cause alleged[.”] An expert\n         fails this standard of certainty if he testifies that the\n         alleged cause “possibly[,”] or “could have” led to the\n         result, that it “could very properly account” for the result,\n         or even that it was “very highly probable” that it caused\n         the result.\n\n      Kovach v. Cent. Trucking, Inc., 808 A.2d 958, 959-60\n      (Pa. Super. 2002) (citing Cohen v. Albert Einstein Med. Ctr.,\n      N. Div., 592 A.2d 720, 723-24 (Pa. Super. 1991)).\n\n      In the case at bar, [Appellants] cannot establish to a reasonable\n      degree of medical certainty that [Appellees’] failure to report\n      their alleged suspicions that [K.H.] was a victim of child abuse\n      caused his injuries on December 18, 2002. [K.H.] was not\n      injured as a result of any of the treatment he was given by\n      [Appellees]. Rather, [Appellants] allege that [Appellees] were\n      negligent merely for failing to discover and report the non-\n      medical source of [K.H.’s] condition. Even if [Appellees] had\n      reported a suspicion of child abuse to the appropriate\n      authorities, there is no way to prove that Lancaster County\n      Children and Youth Services would have definitely intervened\n      and removed [K.H.] from his home.                Suggesting that\n      [Appellees’] failure to report the abuse “could very [probably]”\n      account for [K.H.’s] injuries is insufficient as a matter of law.\n      [Appellants] are required to demonstrate to a reasonable degree\n      of medical certainty that [Appellees] caused [K.H.’s] injuries,\n      which they are unable to do in this case without engaging in\n      speculation and conjecture.\n\nT.C.O. at 20-21 (citations modified).\n\n      The trial court’s recitation of the standard is incomplete, because it\n\nwholly neglects to acknowledge, and arguably contravenes, Pennsylvania\n\ncase law recognizing the relaxed burden of proof reserved for cases in which\n\nit would be unreasonable and inequitable to demand that a plaintiff provide\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 36 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nconclusive evidence that the defendant is the direct and exclusive cause of\n\nthe harm alleged. This Court has explained as follows:\n\n       In Hamil v. Bashline, our Supreme Court adopted the relaxed\n       “increased-risk-of-harm” standard for use in certain medical\n       malpractice claims.      392 A.2d 1280, 1288 (Pa. 1978).  In\n       adopting this principle, the Hamil Court reasoned:\n\n          In light of our interpretation of [subs]ection 323(a),[ 16] it\n          follows that where medical causation is a factor in a case\n          coming within that Section,[17] it is not necessary that the\n          plaintiff introduce medical evidence in addition to that\n          already adduced to prove defendant’s conduct increased\n          the risk of harm—to establish that the negligence asserted\n          resulted in plaintiff’s injury. Rather, once the jury is\n          apprised of the likelihood that defendant’s conduct resulted\n          in plaintiff’s harm, [subsection 323(a)] leaves to the jury,\n          and not the medical expert, the task of balancing\n          probabilities.\n\n       Hamil, 392 A.2d at 1288.                Subsequently, our high court\n       explained:\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n16\n       Negligent Performance of Undertaking to Render Services\n\n       One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render\n       services to another which he should recognize as necessary for\n       the protection of the other's person or things, is subject to\n       liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure\n       to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if\n\n          (a) his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of\n          such harm . . . .\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 323(a).\n17\n      We have held that subsection 323(a) applies, inter alia, to failure-to-\ndiagnose cases. See Jones v. Montefiore Hosp., 431 A.2d 920, 925\n(Pa. 1981) (citing Gradel v. Inouye, 421 A.2d 674 (Pa. 1980)). We can\nconceive of no reason why it would not apply in this case, which involves\nboth failure-to-diagnose and failure-to-report claims.\n\n\n\n                                          - 37 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n        An example of this type of case is a failure of a physician\n        to timely diagnose breast cancer.           Although timely\n        detection of breast cancer may well reduce the likelihood\n        that the patient will have a terminal result, even with\n        timely detection and optimal treatment, a certain\n        percentage of patients unfortunately will succumb to the\n        disease. This statistical factor, however, does not preclude\n        a plaintiff from prevailing in a lawsuit. Rather, once there\n        is testimony that there was a failure to detect the cancer in\n        a timely fashion, and such failure increased the risk that\n        the woman would have either a shortened life expectancy\n        or suffered harm, then it is a question for the jury whether\n        they believe, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\n        acts or omissions of the physician were a substantial factor\n        in bringing about the harm. See Jones v. Montefiore\n        Hosp., 431 A.2d 920 (Pa. 1981).\n\n     Mitzelfelt, 584 A.2d at 892; see Smith v. Grab, 705 A.2d 894,\n     899 (Pa. Super. 1997) (stating expert’s testimony demonstrating\n     increased risk of harm “furnishes a basis for the fact-finder to go\n     further and find that such increased risk of harm was in turn a\n     substantial factor in bringing about the resultant harm”) (quoting\n     Hamil, supra).\n\n     Accordingly, in cases where the plaintiff has introduced sufficient\n     evidence that the defendant’s conduct increased the risk of\n     injury, the defendant will not avoid liability merely because the\n     plaintiff’s medical expert was unable to testify with certainty that\n     the defendant’s conduct caused the actual harm. Montgomery\n     v. S. Phila. Med. Grp., Inc., 656 A.2d 1385, 1392\n     (Pa. Super. 1995) (citing Mitzelfelt, supra). The trial court may\n     send the issue of causation to the jury “upon a less than normal\n     threshold of proof” as long as reasonable minds could conclude\n     that a preponderance of the evidence shows the defendant’s\n     conduct was a substantial factor in causing the resulting harm.\n     Id. The determination then rests with the jury. Mitzelfelt,\n     supra; Montgomery, supra at 1391 (citing Jones, supra).\n\nCarrozza v. Greenbaum, 866 A.2d 369, 380-81 (Pa.

Super. 2006) (“Once there is sufficient testimony to establish that\n\n(1) the [health care provider] failed to exercise reasonable care, that\n\n(2) such failure increased the risk of physical harm to the plaintiff, and\n\n(3) such harm did in fact occur, then it is a question properly left to the jury\n\nto decide whether the acts or omissions were the proximate cause of the\n\ninjury.   The jury, not the medical expert, then has the duty to balance\n\nprobabilities and decide whether defendant’s negligence was a substantial\n\nfactor in bringing about the harm.”).\n\n      In reliance upon Hamil and other decisions, this Court further has held\n\nthat “[a] defendant cannot escape liability because there was a statistical\n\npossibility   that   the    harm   could   have   resulted   without   negligence.”\n\nMontgomery v. S. Phila. Med. Grp., Inc., 656 A.2d 1385, 1392\n\n(Pa. Super. 1995).         The concurrence of a contributing cause with the\n\nnegligence at issue in a given case “does not relieve the defendant from\n\nliability unless he can show that such other cause would have produced the\n\ninjury independently of his negligence.”          Id.

Highlights of Dr. Breitenstein’s report include his opinion, “based\n\non [his] training, expertise and knowledge handling child abuse cases, [that]\n\nthe obvious signs and symptoms of child abuse to [K.H.] that were missed\n\nby this child’s physicians . . . [were] as troublesome as [he has] seen in\n\n[his] career.” Id. at 2. In a detailed account of the procedures prescribed\n\nfor children and youth agencies who receive a report of abuse featuring\n\nsymptoms such as those at issue in this case even as early as September 9,\n\n2002, Dr. Breitenstein opined that an investigation would have been\n\nconducted within twenty-four hours of the report; the case would have been\n\ndesignated “high risk” in light of K.H.’s age and the nature of his injuries;\n\nand the investigation would have “involved immediately going to the location\n\nof the child.”   Id. at 4.   Because the suspected abuse involved “serious\n\nphysical injury,” Dr. Breitenstein indicated, the children and youth agency\n\n“would also have notified the District Attorney,” and “a detective or other\n\nlaw enforcement officer designated by the county district attorney would\n\nhave collaborated with [Children and Youth Services (“CYS”)] and been\n\ninvolved with the interviews and the investigation.” Id. Moreover, “[g]iven\n\n                                    - 41 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nthat the parents were the primary persons that cared for the child, their\n\ninterviews would have been extensive and comprehensive to determine if\n\nthey were the abuser [sic].” Id. at 5.\n\n      Dr. Breitenstein’s lengthy report addressed directly why it was his\n\nexpert opinion, to a reasonable degree of professional certainty, that K.H.’s\n\ncatastrophic brain injury would have been prevented had an appropriate\n\nreport been made by one or more of K.H.’s physicians between September\n\nand December 2002:\n\n      The [CPSL] provides remedies to protect children even if the\n      perpetrator is unknown. The CPSL provides that the child may\n      be taken into custody pursuant to a court order or by a law\n      enforcement officer or duly authorized court officer if there are\n      reasonable grounds to believe that the child is suffering from\n      illness or injury or is in imminent danger from his surroundings\n      and his removal is necessary. From September 9, 2002 until\n      December 18, 2002, [K.H.] suffered from severe injuries (rib\n      fractures, vertebral compressions, rapid increase in head size, as\n      well as bruising and scratches) and given his age and\n      vulnerability to future abuse he would certainly be considered to\n      be in imminent danger.        Therefore, either the investigating\n      officer or detective would have taken protective custody or\n      the CYS worker would have sought a court order for\n      protective custody if the perpetrator was unknown and/or\n      had not been arrested.\n\nId. at 5 (emphasis added). Given Dr. Breitenstein’s credentials, experience,\n\nand the detail and certainty with which he asserted his conclusions regarding\n\ncausation, the trial court’s conclusion that, “[e]ven if [Appellees] had\n\nreported a suspicion of child abuse to the appropriate authorities, there is no\n\nway to prove that [CYS] would have definitely intervened,” T.C.O. at 21,\n\nappears to us to be a patent usurpation upon the sort of determination of\n\n                                    - 42 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nfact   that   belongs    with    a   jury.     Dr. Breitenstein   outlined   what   he\n\ncharacterized as mandatory protocols observed by children and youth\n\nagencies in every county in Pennsylvania that essentially guaranteed some\n\nsignificant degree of intervention upon a report of K.H.’s symptoms.19\n____________________________________________\n\n\n19\n       Appellees, Dr. Kumar in particular, attempt to cast Dr. Breitenstein’s\ntestimony as wholly conjectural, opining that he cannot presume to know\nhow CYS would have responded to a report under these circumstances. The\nstrongest rebuttal of this argument is Dr. Breitenstein’s report, which not\nonly outlines his extensive experience in responding to these requests, but\nalso outlines mandatory events that would follow a report of this nature as\nwell as testifying with a reasonable degree of professional certainty that\nproper reports in this case would have resulted in a heightened degree of\nscrutiny, and a more rapid response, then reports of lesser harm.\nFurthermore, Dr. Kumar’s resort to Kovach v. Central Trucking, Inc., 808\nA.2d 958 (Pa. Super. 2002), for the proposition that “no matter how skilled\nor experienced the expert witness may be, he will not be permitted to guess\nor to state a judgment based on mere conjecture,” does her argument no\nfavors, given our ruling in that case. See Brief for Kumar at 32 (quoting\nKovach, 808 A.2d at 959). In Kovach, we reversed a trial court ruling\nexcluding a physician-expert’s testimony upon the basis that it was\nspeculative. Specifically, we determined that the trial court should not have\nexcluded the expert’s testimony regarding whether the accident sued-upon\nresulted in the plaintiff’s knee injuries, even though the expert admitted that\nhe could not be certain about the condition of the plaintiff’s knees before the\naccident, or whether the injuries complained of were entirely a result of the\naccident or constituted an aggravation of a pre-existing injury. Nonetheless,\nbecause the expert testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that\nthe accident had been a substantial cause, if not the only cause, of the\nplaintiff’s injuries, we ruled that the trial court should have admitted the\ntestimony. 808 A.2d at 959-61. We read Dr. Breitenstein’s testimony as\nneither less certain nor more qualified or conjectural than the expert’s in\nKovach. Consequently, his testimony certainly provided sufficient support\nwith regard to causation to avoid summary judgment in the instant case.\n       Dr. Siwek also attacks the sufficiency of Dr. Breitenstein’s testimony.\nHowever, she does so almost entirely by quibbling with the assertions\ntherein. See Brief for Siwek at 15-18. Dr. Siwek’s alternative view of the\ncase has no place in a summary judgment proceeding; to the extent that we\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                          - 43 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n      In light of the liberal standard Pennsylvania courts are directed by\n\nHamil and its progeny to apply to increased-risk-of-harm cases where direct\n\ncausation cannot be established, and Appellants’ voluminous evidence,\n\nstated to a reasonable degree of medical or professional certainty, that\n\nAppellees’ acts or omissions substantially increased K.H.’s risk of harm, the\n\ntrial court simply applied too rigid a standard in finding that Appellants’\n\nevidence of causation was so speculative as to warrant dismissal.     To the\n\ncontrary, the causation evidence submitted by Appellants for precisely that\n\npurpose was a model of the sort of evidence that Hamil deemed sufficient to\n\nsupport a prima facie case of medical negligence.    Consequently, the trial\n\ncourt erred when it found Appellants’ causation evidence wanting.20\n\n      Having found, supra, that Appellants’ showings also were adequate to\n\nestablish jury questions regarding all four elements of medical malpractice,\n\nwe conclude that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Appellees.\n\n      D.     Appellants’ Entitlement to a Jury Instruction Regarding\n             Negligence Per Se Is Moot.\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\ndeem Dr. Breitenstein’s testimony to have been sufficiently certain to reach\na jury, we need only consider that testimony, viewing it in the light most\nfavorable to the Appellants.\n20\n      The trial court’s erroneous conclusions follow in part from a question-\nbegging premise. In ruling that K.H. “was not injured as a result of any\ntreatment,” the court implicitly assumed that the standard of care entails\nonly clinical treatment, and does not require reporting suspicions of abuse,\nwhich we have found involves a fact question to be determined by a jury.\n\n\n\n                                           - 44 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n      We now turn to Appellants’ third issue.     Appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred in determining that they are not entitled to a negligence per\n\nse jury instruction on the grounds that Appellees’ violation of the CPSL,\n\nwithout more, would suffice to establish a breach of Appellees’ duty for\n\npurposes of setting forth claims of medical malpractice, leaving the jury after\n\nsuch a finding to assess only proximate causation and damages. We need\n\nnot resolve this issue, for two reasons.\n\n      First, whether to provide a negligence per se instruction is not typically\n\na matter that is disposed of in a motion for summary judgment, insofar as\n\nits propriety most often is a matter to be measured against the evidence\n\nadduced at trial. Second, the trial court’s ruling on this matter was based in\n\npart upon premises that we have rejected above. Thus, the court may rule\n\ndifferently in light of our analysis of those premises and the parties’\n\npresentations of the evidence at trial. Because this issue was prematurely\n\naddressed, and presently is moot, we leave its final disposition for the trial\n\ncourt in the first instance, without prejudice to Appellants’ entitlement to\n\nraise the issue in a future post-trial appeal, should the trial court again\n\nreject their request for such an instruction.\n\n      E.    Appellants Have Set Forth a Cognizable Claim for\n            Corporate Negligence Against LGH.\n\n      Finally, we consider Appellants’ argument that the trial court erred in\n\ndismissing their claims against LGH for corporate negligence. The following\n\nstandard governs:\n\n\n                                     - 45 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n      Corporate negligence is a doctrine under which the hospital is\n      liable if it fails to uphold the proper standard of care owed the\n      patient, which is to ensure the patient’s safety and well-being\n      while at the hospital.         This theory of liability creates a\n      nondelegable duty which the hospital owes directly to a patient.\n      Therefore, an injured party does not have to rely on and\n      establish the negligence of a third party.\n\n      The hospital’s duties have been classified into four general\n      areas: (1) a duty to use reasonable care in the maintenance of\n      safe and adequate facilities and equipment—Chandler Gen.\n      Hosp. Inc. v. Purvis, 181 S.E.2d 77 (Ga. Ct. App. 1971); (2) a\n      duty to select and retain only competent physicians—Johnson\n      v. Misericordia Comm. Hosp., 301 N.W.2d 156 (Wis. 1981);\n      (3) a duty to oversee all persons who practice medicine within its\n      walls as to patient care—Darling v. Charleston Comm. Mem.\n      Hosp., 211 N.E.2d 253 (Ill. 1965); and (4) a duty to formulate,\n      adopt and enforce adequate rules and policies to ensure quality\n      care for the patients—Wood v. Samaritan Institution, Inc.,\n      161 P.2d 556 (Cal. Ct. App. 1945); see Comment, The Hospital-\n      Physician Relationship: Hospital Responsibility for Malpractice of\n      Physicians, 50 Wash.L.Rev. 385 (1975); Note, Medical\n      Malpractice—Ostensible Agency & Corporate Negligence, 17 St.\n      Mary’s L.J. 551 (1986).\n\nThompson v. Nason Hosp., 591 A.2d 703, 707 (Pa. 1991) (citations\n\nmodified; footnote omitted); see Scampone v. Highland Park Care Ctr.,\n\nLLC, 57 A.3d 582, 597-98 (Pa. 2012).\n\n      Appellants’ claims hinge upon their claim that LGH failed to have\n\nappropriate policies in place for the retention and availability of patients’\n\nprior radiological studies and failed to retain adequately qualified physicians\n\nto read pediatric radiographs. The trial court rejected these claims for the\n\nfollowing reasons:\n\n      [Appellants’ claim regarding retention of radiographs] falls under\n      the hospital’s duty to “adopt and enforce rules and policies to\n      ensure quality care for the patient[.” Appellants] have failed to\n\n\n                                    - 46 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n     produce any specific policies or procedures that address LGH’s\n     method for storing and organizing patients’ past radiological\n     studies. Moreover, neither [Appellants], nor Dr. Oestreich in his\n     report, claim that having had access to [K.H.’s] prior studies\n     would have assisted Dr. Mack and Dr. Smigocki in interpreting\n     the radiographic studies in question.     Instead, Dr. Oestreich\n     asserts that the studies would have assisted the radiologists in\n     diagnosing child abuse. Since the [trial c]ourt has already\n     determined that Pennsylvania does not impose a duty upon\n     physicians to report suspected child abuse, even if Drs. Mack\n     and Smigocki had determined that [K.H.] was being abused,\n     they would not have been under a statutory or common[-]law\n     duty to report it.\n\n     Finally, [Appellants] assert that, in employing Dr. Mack, LGH\n     “failed to employ a pediatric radiologist [who] was adequately\n     trained, experienced and qualified in reading pediatric\n     radiographs and the recognition of abuse[.”] (Oestreich Report,\n     [Appellants’]    Exhibit   TT    [to   Omnibus    Memorandum].)\n     Specifically, Appellants point to the fact that, in her deposition\n     testimony, Dr. Mack stated that she primarily read breast\n     imaging studies, was the chief of the mammography section, and\n     did not have a special[ty] in reading pediatric radiographs. As\n     demonstrated by her Curriculum Vitae, Dr. Mack completed a\n     Pediatric Radiology Fellowship at Children’s Medical Center in\n     Dallas, Texas[,] from 1994 to 1995. . . . Additionally, she is\n     Board Certified in Radiology with a “Certificate of Added\n     Qualifications in Pediatric Radiology[.”] Given these credentials,\n     there is absolutely no question that Dr. Mack was qualified to\n     read K.H.’s studies.\n\nT.C.O. at 26.\n\n     We begin with the trial court’s latter rationale.   In response to the\n\ndetermination that “there is absolutely no question that Dr. Mack was\n\nqualified to read [K.H.’s] studies,” Appellant argues that the trial court\n\nessentially resolved a material question of fact best left to the jury in\n\naccepting Dr. Mack’s CV as evidence conclusive of her qualifications despite\n\nDr. Mack’s testimony that her principal responsibilities at the relevant time\n\n\n                                   - 47 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\ninvolved mammography rather than pediatric radiology.          The trial court\n\nprovided no additional support to suggest that this was a determination\n\nappropriately resolved by the court rather than by a jury. However strongly\n\nDr. Mack’s CV might militate in favor of finding that she was qualified, we\n\nfind no principled basis not to have allowed the jury to resolve the\n\ndiscrepancy.   On summary judgment, as our governing standard makes\n\nclear, all doubts are to be resolved in favor of the non-moving party. The\n\ntrial court’s conclusion in this regard is inconsistent with the governing\n\nstandard.   Accordingly, to the extent the trial court’s ruling on corporate\n\nnegligence depended on this finding, we reject it.\n\n      With respect to the trial court’s first rationale, Appellants aptly note\n\nthat the trial court expressly relied upon its own finding that no civil remedy\n\nfor a failure to reporting child abuse would lie under the CPSL or the\n\ncommon law.     Insofar as we have rejected the trial court’s ruling in this\n\nregard, that rationale will not stand.\n\n      Appellants further argue that the trial court’s determination that they\n\n“failed to produce any specific policies or procedures that address LGH’s\n\nmethod for storing and organizing patients’ past radiological studies” proves,\n\nrather than undermines, their claim, insofar as their allegations that LGH\n\nwas negligent inhered in the absence of such policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 48 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n       In support of this claim, Appellants cite the following exchange from\n\nDr. Smigocki’s deposition testimony:21\n\n       Q.     Is there somebody in your office that you would ask or—\n\n       A.     Our office? No. It would be a hospital record.\n\n       Q.     Is there somebody at the hospital that you would ask?\n\n       A.     The film library.\n\n       Q.     Is there a person that’s currently a custodian or at the film\n       library that you would ask?\n\n       A.     No.\n\n       Q.    When you reviewed and interpreted the December 6th,\n       2002, ultrasound, you had whatever information was written on\n       the order form; correct?\n\n       A.     I would assume.\n\n       Q.     Okay. And you also had any previous studies; correct?\n\n       A.     Possibly.\n\n       Q.     Why do you say “possibly”?\n\n       A.     Well, previous studies are not always available.\n\n       Q.   Okay. And what are the range of reasons why they\n       wouldn’t be available?\n\n       A.     Sometimes they can’t be located. Sometimes—\n\n       Q.     Like, if they’re lost?\n\n       A.    They could be lost. They could be misplaced. They could\n       be in a referring clinician’s trunk.\n____________________________________________\n\n\n21\n      This excerpt starts in medias res, a product of Appellants’ election to\nattach only excerpts of the deposition transcript to their Omnibus\nMemorandum. However, there is sufficient context to understand the thrust\nof Appellants’ contentions and the degree to which Dr. Smigocki’s testimony\nsupports them.\n\n\n\n                                          - 49 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n     Q.    If they were lost or misplaced or in a referring clinician’s\n     trunk, there would still be a record of the fact that they had\n     existed; correct?\n\n     A.    Presumably.\n\n     Q.   Okay. So you would have available to you at least a list of\n     what previous studies there were.\n\n     A.    Yes.\n\n     Q.     And if it turned out that you wanted to review a previous\n     study, but it wasn’t in the—it would have been electronic or in\n     the film jacket?\n\n     A.    I don’t know how it was back in 2002.\n\nNotes of Deposition Testimony—Gene Smigocki, 10/4/2012, at 85-86.\n\n     Even if we assume that this testimony, standing alone, provides only\n\nlimited support for the proposition that LGH did not have an appropriate\n\nrecords policy, one that might have enabled Drs. Mack or Smigocki to\n\nconduct a clinically appropriate comparative review of K.H.’s radiographs\n\nwith former studies, once again it usurps the trial court’s function to pass\n\njudgment on the weight of this evidence in reviewing a motion for summary\n\njudgment. This testimony provides a modicum of support for the proposition\n\nthat LGH’s records policy was either inadequate, or inadequately conveyed\n\nto physicians with LGH privileges, such that corporate negligence might lie\n\nfor a breach of LGH’s “duty to formulate, adopt and enforce adequate rules\n\nand policies to ensure quality care for the patients.” See Thompson, 591\n\nA.2d at 707. In his report, Dr. Oestreich noted that it was “unfortunate that\n\nDr. Mack failed to review the chest x-ray from [K.H.’s] birth. To the extent\n\nthat it was not made available to her, the hospital/practice group should\n\n\n                                   - 50 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nhave had a practice in place for the prior films to be available for review.”\n\nOestreich Report at 8. This, viewed in tandem with Dr. Smigocki’s equivocal\n\ntestimony regarding LGH’s policies for retaining prior scans, sufficed to\n\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact, such that it was error for the trial\n\ncourt to grant summary judgment to LGH relative to Appellants’ claims for\n\ncorporate negligence.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n       In its contemporary form, the Hippocratic Oath sworn by aspiring\n\nphysicians in the United States provides, inter alia, that “I will remember\n\nthat I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human\n\nbeing, whose illness may affect the person’s family and economic stability.\n\nMy responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately\n\nfor the sick.” The Oath also provides that “I will prevent disease whenever I\n\ncan, for prevention is preferable to cure.” In its archaic form, the Oath also\n\nprovided that “I will keep [the sick] from harm and injustice.”22\n\n       These sound sentiments are embodied in the CPSL, it is true, but the\n\npotential harm that may befall children when their physicians fail to behave\n\naccording to professional reporting requirements vastly exceeds the harm\n\ninuring to the public. Children, like all individuals, find legal protection, and\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n22\n     For all quotations, see Bioethics, Johns Hopkins Sheradan Libraries &\nUniversity   Museums,     available    at   guides.library.jhu.edu/c.php?g=\n202502&p=1335752 (last reviewed June 26, 2015).\n\n\n\n                                          - 51 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\ngrounds for civil recourse, whenever a physician violates his or her duty of\n\ncare. That duty of care is determined not by the General Assembly but by\n\nthe community of physicians.       Irrespective of whether the legislature\n\nintended to imply a private right of action under the CPSL, it beggars belief\n\nthat, in enacting that statute, the General Assembly intended to immunize\n\nfrom civil redress violations of the standard of care so severe that the\n\nlegislature deemed them worthy of criminal punishment.       The anomaly is\n\ncast into relief even more stark when one considers that civil redress\n\nundisputedly remains available for far less egregious violations of that\n\nstandard of care.\n\n      We need not address on this day whether the CPSL itself furnishes\n\nsuch a remedy; Appellants do not argue that it does. Indeed, today we need\n\nnot decide whether, as Appellants allege, Appellees serially violated the\n\nstandard of care in passing K.H. amongst themselves while repeatedly\n\nsetting aside concerns that he was the victim of abuse. Nor need we decide\n\nwhether, in so doing, Appellees caused the crippling harm that eventually\n\nbefell K.H. at the hands of his biological father’s continuing abuse. Indeed,\n\nthe essence of our ruling is that it is not our place, nor that of the trial\n\njudge, to do so.    We need decide only whether the trial court improperly\n\nintruded upon Appellants’ right to have a jury hear testimony regarding the\n\nindependent obligations of the standard of care and testimony to the effect\n\nthat such violations, if any, substantially increased K.H.’s risk of harm over\n\nthe several months that K.H. presented to the various Appellees, allegedly\n\n                                    - 52 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nwith tell-tale signs of continuing abuse the nature of which was readily\n\ndetectable by those physicians. The trial court did precisely that, in violation\n\nof the governing standard.\n\n       Specifically, the trial court improperly ruled that Appellants failed to\n\npresent a prima facie case of medical malpractice against all six named\n\nAppellees who undertook K.H.’s care from September to December of 2002.\n\nThis includes both Appellants’ claims of malpractice predicated on the\n\nfailures to report suspicions of abuse as well as their claims against Dr. Mack\n\nand Dr. Smigocki, and the vicarious liability of Lancaster Radiology and LGH,\n\nfor malpractice associated with their review of K.H.’s radiographs.23 We also\n\nfind that Appellants have set forth a prima facie case of corporate negligence\n\nagainst LGH. Finally, we find that any decision regarding the propriety of a\n\nnegligence per se instruction would be premature and advisory, insofar as\n\nour other disposition and analyses of related issues render the matter moot\n\nat this time.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse in all aspects the trial court’s\n\nentry of summary judgment for Appellees and its dismissal with prejudice of\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n23\n       Because the trial court’s dismissal of these claims was based upon its\nfinding that Appellants could not seek damages for the failure to report that\nAppellants allege was, in part, a consequence of Drs. Mack and Smigocki’s\nmalpractice in this regard, our ruling that such claims will lie renders the\ntrial court’s disposition of these claims erroneous.\n\n\n\n                                          - 53 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nAppellants’ amended complaint, and we remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n      Judgment reversed.

Although this case nominally presents several issues, their\n\nresolution principally rests upon our answer to one question: Whether, as\n\nthe trial court ruled, the lack of an express statutory civil remedy under the\n\nChild Protective Services Law (“CPSL”), 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 6301, et seq.,\n\nimplicitly precludes a common-law remedy in tort for harms sustained due to\n\nchild abuse when a physician has failed to report reasonable suspicions that\n\na child is a victim of abuse to the government authorities designated by the\n\nCPSL. After careful review of the record and the seventeen party briefs filed\n\nin this case, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\nI.    Introduction\n\n      This case presents this Court with various challenges to two trial court\n\norders that entered summary judgment for Appellees and collectively\n\ndismissed all of Appellants’ claims against the Appellees.        Motions for\n\nsummary judgment are governed by Pa.R.C.P. 1035.2, which provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n      After the relevant pleadings are closed, but within such time as\n      not to unreasonably delay trial, any party may move for\n      summary judgment in whole or in part as a matter of law\n\n           (1)   whenever there is no genuine issue of any material\n                 fact as to a necessary element of the cause of action\n                 or defense which could be established by additional\n                 discovery or expert report, or\n\n           (2)   if, after the completion of discovery relevant to the\n                 motion including the production of expert reports, an\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n              adverse party who will bear the burden of proof at\n              trial has failed to produce evidence of facts essential\n              to the cause of action or defense which in a jury trial\n              would require the issues to be submitted to a jury.\n\nPa.R.C.P. 1035.2.\n\n     In reviewing an order granting or denying summary judgment, we\n\napply the following standard:\n\n     We must examine the entire record in the light most favorable to\n     the non-moving party and resolve all doubts against the moving\n     party when determining if there is a genuine issue of material\n     fact. We will only reverse the lower court’s grant of summary\n     judgment if there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Summary\n     judgment should be granted only in cases where the right is\n     clear and free of doubt. Summary judgment serves to eliminate\n     the waste of time and resources of both litigants and the courts\n     in cases where a trial would be a useless formality.\n\nFirst v.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      As noted, we are constrained in this procedural posture to grant\n\nAppellants the most favorable account of the evidence of record.              For\n\npresent purposes, the trial court’s account of the factual background and\n\nprocedural history of this case suffices.\n\n      [K.H.] was born to [H.S.] and her former husband, [C.S.], on\n      June 29, 2002 at [LGH]. [K.H.] was born prematurely at thirty-\n      three weeks[’] gestation as a result of maternal preeclampsia.\n      Following his birth, [K.H.] was admitted to the Neonatal\n      Intensive Care Unit where he remained until his release from the\n      hospital on July 15, 2002. After his discharge, [K.H.] was\n      monitored by Dr. Shakthi Kumar at [Lancaster Pediatric]. [K.H.]\n      suffered from respiratory, cardiac and gastrointestinal\n      complications due to his prematurity, and was admitted to LGH\n      on five occasions in July and August of 2002 pursuant to these\n      issues.\n\n      On September 9, 2002, [H.S.] took [K.H.] to [Lancaster\n      Pediatric] with symptoms including congestion, spitting up,\n      wheezing and refusing to sleep and eat. [K.H.] was examined\n      by Dr. Yvonne Siwek, who ordered a chest X-ray. The X-ray was\n      performed and read by Dr. Julie Mack at LGH. Dr. Mack noted\n      that [K.H.’s] lungs were clear, but that the X-ray showed healing\n      fractures of the fifth and sixth ribs and flattening of the vertebral\n      bodies at T8, T9, T12, L2, L3 and L4. Dr. Mack discussed her\n      findings with Dr. Siwek by telephone. While concerned about\n      the potential of child abuse, Dr. Mack concluded that the more\n      likely cause of the injuries was a congenital issue secondary to\n      [K.H.’s] premature birth.           Dr. Siwek memorialized the\n      conversation with an entry in her office chart and referred [K.H.]\n      to Dr. Donald Diverio, a pediatric orthopedist at AO Orthopedics.\n\n      On September 12, 2002, [K.H.] was examined by Dr. Diverio.\n      Dr. Diverio noted that [K.H.] became irritable upon palpation of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n     his ribs. Dr. Diverio additionally reviewed the September 9th X-\n     rays. At the conclusion of the office visit, Dr. Diverio accused\n     [H.S. and C.S.] of child abuse.1 After the appointment, [H.S.\n     and C.S.] took [K.H.] to see Dr. Kumar and told her about\n     Dr. Diverio’s allegations. [Appellants] assert that, following their\n     conversation, Dr. Kumar called Dr. Diverio and discussed\n     [K.H.’s] injuries with him.\n\n     ____________________\n        1\n           During his deposition, Dr. Diverio denied accusing [H.S.\n        and C.S.] of abusing [K.H.]. Nevertheless, for summary\n        judgment purposes, viewing the record in the light most\n        favorable to the non-moving party, the [c]ourt will assume\n        that these allegations were made as pled in Plaintiffs’\n        Amended Complaint.\n\n     Later the same day, [K.H.] underwent a bone survey performed\n     and read by Dr. Mack at LGH.          Dr. Mack’s report identified\n     healing rib fractures and vertebral deformities.\n\n     On October 2, 2002, [K.H.] was seen by Dr. Atilla Devenyi, a\n     gastroenterologist at [Regional Gastroenterology]. Dr. Devenyi\n     examined [K.H.] and noted a rash or bruise on his sternum and\n     chest wall. Dr. Devenyi reported his findings to Dr. Kumar.\n     [K.H.] was seen in Dr. Kumar’s office on October 3, 2002, where\n     she also observed the mark on his lateral chest wall and\n     sternum.    Dr. Kumar noted in her office chart, “Seen by\n     Dr. Devenyi yesterday. Ordered PT/PTT, CBC with platelets for a\n     pattern seen on the chest that was suspicious for abuse. He also\n     ordered a skeletal survey[.”] Later that day, Dr. Kumar spoke\n     with Dr. Devenyi about the skeletal survey and laboratory tests\n     that he ordered, and, following their conversation, the tests were\n     canceled.\n\n     On December 3, 2002, [K.H.] presented at [Lancaster Pediatric]\n     for an appointment with Dr. Kumar. Dr. Kumar examined [K.H.]\n     and noted an increase in the size of his head as well as a bruise\n     on his forearm. On December 6, 2002, [K.H.] underwent a\n     chest X-ray at LGH. Dr. Mack read the X-ray and reported[]\n     “minimal deformity of [the] anterior lateral 7th rib compatible\n     with [a] remote healing fracture” as well as “smooth periosteal\n     reaction involving both humeri[.”] Dr. Mack additionally noted,\n     “if there is any clinical concern of non-accidental trauma, full\n     skeletal series should be performed[.”]\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n       On December 6, 2002, [K.H.] underwent         an ultrasound of his\n       head at LGH. Dr. Gene Smigocki read           and interpreted the\n       ultrasound and noted, “no evidence             of hydronephrosis.\n       Asymmetrically prominent left frontal horn.   No hemorrhage[.”]\n\n       On December 18, 2002, [K.H.] was discovered at home in his\n       crib unresponsive by [C.S.] and was rushed to LGH. A CT scan\n       of his head was performed[,] which showed a left frontal\n       intracranial hemorrhage. Consequently, [K.H.] was transported\n       via helicopter to Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. It was later\n       confirmed that [K.H.] had suffered non-accidental injuries\n       including “contusion in the high left parietal region with\n       surrounding edema with mass effect, interhemispheric subdural\n       hematoma, tentorium subdural hematoma, and small left\n       frontoparietal subdural hematoma[.”]        It was additionally\n       determined that [K.H.] suffered these injuries because he was\n       shaken. As a consequence of this incident, [C.S.] was charged\n       with and convicted of felony child abuse and is currently serving\n       a five- to ten[-]year prison sentence.\n\n       [Appellants] claim that, as a result of his injuries, [K.H.] suffers\n       from permanent brain damage and seizures, physical and\n       neurodevelopmental deficits, disabilities and delays, delayed\n       growth and development, and other physical traumas.\n       [Appellants] additionally allege that [K.H.] has sustained\n       numerous personal injuries including substantial pain and\n       suffering, mental anguish, loss of life’s pleasures, humiliation,\n       embarrassment and disfigurement.\n\n       On January 13, 2009, [H.S.] and her current husband, [E.H.], on\n       behalf of [K.H.] and in their own right, filed a Complaint for\n       medical professional liability in the Lancaster County Court of\n       Common Pleas.        In the Complaint, [Appellants] asserted\n       negligence claims against Dr. Kumar, Dr. Siwek, [Lancaster\n       Pediatric], Dr. Diverio, AO Orthopedics, Dr. Mack, [Lancaster\n       Radiology,] and LGH, alleging that they collectively failed to\n       recognize, treat and report child abuse pursuant to\n       Pennsylvania’s [CPSL] §§ 6311 and § 6313.[2] [Appellees] filed\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n       Specifically, section 6311 of the CPSL obligates, inter alia, any person\n“licensed or certified to practice in any health-related field under the\njurisdiction of the Department of State,” as well as any “employee of a\nhealth care facility or provider licensed by the Department of Health, who is\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n      Preliminary Objections in the nature of a demurrer, which\n      [o]bjections were overruled without [o]pinion by the Honorable\n      Dennis E. Reinaker on October 13, 2009. On November 19,\n      2009, the Court amended its [o]rder overruling the [p]reliminary\n      [o]bjections to include a certification for immediate interlocutory\n      appeal to the Superior Court. [Appellees] then filed a “Petition\n      for Allowance of Appeal” with the Superior Court[,] which was\n      denied via a per curiam [o]rder on February 16, 2010.\n\n      On August 11, 2011, [Appellants] filed an Amended Complaint\n      containing additional claims of negligence against Dr. Avallone,\n      Dr. Smigocki, Dr. Devenyi and [Regional Gastroenterology],\n      alleging that they also failed to report a suspicion of child abuse\n      pursuant to the CPSL. Moreover, [Appellants] asserted medical\n      negligence claims against Drs. Mack and Smigocki based upon\n      misreads of radiographic imaging.         [Appellees] demurred a\n      second time, and their [p]reliminary [o]bjections were overruled\n      again without [o]pinion by Judge Reinaker on January 4, 2012.\n      On June 22, 2012, the case was reassigned to me [i.e., Judge\n      Wright].\n\n      With discovery now complete, [Appellees] have filed Motions for\n      Summary Judgment seeking to dismiss [Appellants’] claims\n      against them.      In their [m]otions, [Appellees] assert that\n      summary judgment is warranted because the CPSL does not\n      create a private civil cause of action for violation of the reporting\n      requirements contained in 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6311 and § 6313.\n      Further, [Appellees] argue that Pennsylvania law does not\n      authorize negligence per se claims based upon violations of the\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\nengaged in the admission, examination, care or treatment of individuals” to\n“make a report of suspected child abuse . . . if the person has reasonable\ncause to suspect that a child is a victim of child abuse.” 23 Pa.C.S.\n§§ 6311(a)(1), (3). Notably, subsection 6311(b)(3) provides that “[n]othing\nin this section shall require the mandated reporter to identify the person\nresponsible for the child abuse to make a report of suspected child abuse.”\nSection 6313 directs the reporting procedure, requiring a mandated reporter\nto “immediately make an oral report of suspected child abuse to the\ndepartment via the Statewide toll-free telephone number . . . or a written\nreport using electronic technologies,” and further directs that an oral\nreporter submit a written report to the assigned department or agency\nwithin forty-eight hours.\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n      CPSL, and that there is no common[-]law duty for a physician to\n      report a reasonable suspicion of child abuse.        Additionally,\n      [Appellees] contend that, even if the [c]ourt recognizes a duty\n      for physicians to report suspected child abuse, [Appellants]\n      cannot establish that [Appellees’] conduct was the legal cause of\n      [K.H.’s] injuries. Finally, LGH asserts that [Appellants] have\n      failed to establish that they are liable for the conduct of the\n      physicians through the doctrine of ostensible agency, or that the\n      hospital engaged in corporate negligence.\n\nTrial Court Opinion (“T.C.O.”), 11/27/2013, at 2-6 (citations omitted).\n\n      After reviewing Appellees’ various arguments, the trial court entered\n\npartial summary judgment as follows:\n\n      [Appellees’] Motions are granted insofar as all of [Appellants’]\n      claims based upon [Appellees’] alleged failure to recognize, treat\n      and report reasonable suspicions of child abuse are dismissed.\n      LGH’s Motions are also granted as to [Appellants’] corporate\n      negligence claims related to the hospital’s failure to adopt\n      policies to ensure quality care for the patient and to select and\n      retain competent physicians. However, Dr. Mack, Dr. Smigocki,\n      [Lancaster Radiology] and [LGH’s] [m]otions are denied with\n      respect to any averments of negligence that are specifically\n      premised on the misinterpretation of radiological studies by\n      Drs. Mack and Smigocki, and the vicarious liability of Lancaster\n      Radiology Associations and [LGH] on these medical malpractice\n      claims.\n\nOrder, 11/27/2013, at 1-2.\n\n      The parties thereafter filed motions for reconsideration.            After\n\nreviewing the motions, the trial court entered an order denying Appellants’\n\nmotion for reconsideration, granting Appellees’ motion for reconsideration,\n\nand dismissing Appellants’ amended complaint in its entirety.     See Order,\n\n2/19/2014, at 1.   The trial court order included a footnote explaining the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\ncourt’s reversal of course as to those claims that initially survived summary\n\njudgment:\n\n      Upon further review of [Appellants’] expert reports submitted by\n      Drs. [Alan E.] Oestreich and [James] Abrahams, the [c]ourt\n      determined that, while both experts initially opine that Drs. Mack\n      and Smigocki misinterpreted [K.H.’s] radiographic studies, they\n      ultimately conclude that the only damage caused by these errors\n      was that the physicians failed to recognize and report suspected\n      child abuse.      The [c]ourt has already determined that\n      Pennsylvania law does not authorize a private cause of action\n      against a physician for failure to report suspected child abuse.\n      Accordingly, [Appellees’] Motion for Reconsideration must be\n      granted.\n\nId. at 1 n.1. The trial court’s February 19, 2014 order rendered final the\n\ncourt’s entry of summary judgment for Appellees as to all of Appellants’\n\nclaims. This timely appeal followed.\n\n      On March 18, 2014, the trial court directed Appellants to file a concise\n\nstatement   of   the   errors   complained    of   on     appeal   pursuant   to\n\nPa.R.A.P. 1925(b), and Appellants timely complied on April 8, 2014.           On\n\nApril 30, 2014, the trial court issued its Rule 1925(a) opinion, which directed\n\nthis Court’s attention to the explanations provided in its lengthy November\n\n27, 2013 opinion, which coincided with its initial order entering partial\n\nsummary judgment.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n      Appellants raise the following issues for review:\n\n      1.    Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n      summary judgment in favor of [Appellees] on purely legal issues\n      that had been decided in favor of [Appellants] on preliminary\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n       objections by a judge of coordinate jurisdiction where no new\n       law or evidence was presented?\n\n       2      Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n       summary judgment in favor of [Appellees] on [Appellants’]\n       legally cognizable claims for professional medical negligence\n       based on [Appellees’] departure from the applicable standard of\n       care where [Appellants] established a duty based on the\n       [Appellees’] admissions and expert opinions?\n\n       3.    Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n       summary judgment on [Appellants’] anticipated request for a\n       negligence per se jury instruction at trial?\n\n       4.    Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n       summary judgment in favor of [Appellees] where the record\n       contained more than adequate evidence, including multiple\n       expert reports, demonstrating [that Appellees’] medical\n       negligence increased the risk of harm to [K.H.]?\n\n       5.     Did the trial court commit an error of law by granting\n       summary judgment in favor of [LGH] on [Appellants’] claims for\n       corporate negligence where the record contained more than\n       sufficient evidence that [LGH] failed to have appropriate policies\n       in place for the retention and availability of patients’ prior\n       radiology studies, and failed to have adequately trained,\n       experienced, and qualified physicians to read pediatric\n       radiographs?\n\nBrief for Appellants at 4-5 (footnote omitted).3\n\n       A.     The Coordinate Jurisdiction Doctrine Does Not Preclude\n              the Trial Court from Granting Summary Judgment.\n\n       Appellants’ first issue is the easiest to resolve, requiring only brief\n\ndiscussion. As noted, supra, the trial court’s entry of summary judgment for\n\nAppellees hinged principally, perhaps exclusively, upon the proposition that\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3\n      Issues two and four overlap sufficiently that we will consider them\ntogether as Appellants’ second issue.\n\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nAppellants’ claims, however denominated, amounted to claims for civil relief\n\nfor violations of the CPSL’s reporting obligations. In effect, Appellants argue\n\nthat Judge Reinaker, the first judge assigned this case, conclusively decided\n\nthis issue in their favor.    Consequently, the coordinate jurisdiction rule\n\nbarred Judge Wright, to whom the matter later was assigned, from granting\n\nsummary judgment for Appellees. We disagree.\n\n      Our Supreme Court has described the coordinate jurisdiction rule as\n\nfollows:\n\n      Generally, the coordinate jurisdiction rule commands that[,]\n      upon transfer of a matter between trial judges of coordinate\n      jurisdiction, a transferee trial judge may not alter resolution of a\n      legal question previously decided by a transferor trial judge.\n      More simply stated, judges of coordinate jurisdiction should not\n      overrule each other’s decisions.\n\n      The reason for this respect for an equal tribunal’s decision . . . is\n      that the coordinate jurisdiction rule is based on a policy of\n      fostering the finality of pre-trial applications in an effort to\n      maintain judicial economy and efficiency. Furthermore, . . . the\n      coordinate jurisdiction rule serves to protect the expectations of\n      the parties, to [e]nsure uniformity of decisions, to maintain\n      consistency in proceedings, to effectuate the administration of\n      justice, and to bring finality to the litigation.\n\nZane v.

A motion for\n      summary judgment is based not only upon the averments of the\n      pleadings but may also consider discovery depositions, answers\n      to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits.”        Austin J.\n      Richards, Inc., v.

In this\n\nCourt’s decision preceding the Supreme Court’s review, we appeared to\n\nexpand Salerno’s reliance upon the lack of trial judge opinion in connection\n\nwith denying preliminary objections to a far broader spectrum of motions\n\nand procedural contexts.     This Court’s ruling to that effect, our Supreme\n\nCourt observed, “stretched far beyond the exception stated in Salerno,\n\nwhich was grounded in the differences between preliminary objections and\n\nsummary judgment motions.”        Goldey, 675 A.2d at 267.        The Supreme\n\nCourt, emphasizing that the “presence or absence of an opinion in support of\n\nthe initial ruling is not controlling,” held without qualification that, “[w]here\n\nthe motions differ in kind, as preliminary objections differ from motions for\n\njudgment on the pleadings, which differ from motions for summary\n\n\n\n                                     - 12 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\njudgment, a judge ruling on a later motion is not precluded from granting\n\nrelief although another judge has denied an earlier motion.” Id.\n\n       Appellants seek to distinguish Salerno from the instant case on the\n\nbasis that, in the instant case, the record relevant to the purely legal issues\n\nraised on summary judgment before Judge Wright was no more expansive\n\nthan the record as it appeared to Judge Reinaker when he overruled\n\nAppellees’ preliminary objections.             Brief for Appellants at 27.   For this\n\nreason, Appellants argue that the procedural context is immaterial, because\n\nthe spirit of the coordinate jurisdiction rule was violated when the trial court\n\naccepted these arguments after they were rejected earlier by a different\n\njudge.

In the discussion that follows, references to\nindividual Appellees’ arguments will occur only rarely, because their\narguments tend to be shared, incorporated by reference, or materially the\nsame. Except when circumstances warrant otherwise, we will simply refer to\n“Appellees’” arguments.\n\n\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nthat case was not an insured, and did not provide an explanatory opinion.\n\nLater, when the same issue was raised before a different judge in a motion\n\nfor summary judgment that did not present any new evidence in support of\n\ndismissal, this Court, citing Goldey, held that the differing nature of the two\n\nmotions sufficed to preclude application of the coordinate jurisdiction rule.\n\n      We agree that Mellon Bank is controlling. Consequently, we find it\n\nimmaterial whether, in fact, the decisional record on summary judgment\n\nbefore Judge Wright varied at all from what Judge Reinaker had at his\n\ndisposal in reviewing Appellees’ preliminary objections.        Under Mellon\n\nBank, the procedural context alone precludes application of the coordinate\n\njurisdiction rule.   Accordingly, we reject Appellants’ argument that Judge\n\nWright was barred from granting Appellees summary judgment by Judge\n\nReinaker’s prior contrary ruling in the context of preliminary objections.\n\n      B.    Appellants Do Not Seek to Establish a Civil Cause of\n            Action Under the CPSL.\n\n      In taking up the questions presented as issues two and four, we\n\ncannot address whether Appellants set forth a prima facie case of medical\n\nmalpractice in various particulars before first addressing the trial court’s and\n\nAppellees’ conclusions that Appellants seek relief that necessarily sounds in\n\na putative civil violation of the CPSL, a statute that expressly provides only\n\ncriminal sanctions against physicians who “willfully” fail to comply with its\n\nterms. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 6319(a)(1). The trial court ruled that the absence\n\nof an express provision in the CPSL providing for such a claim necessarily\n\n\n                                     - 14 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nsignals the exclusion of any civil cause of action based upon a failure to\n\nreport child abuse, requiring dismissal of all of Appellants’ claims.\n\n       Only Appellee Regional Gastroenterology Associates of Lancaster—in a\n\nmere two sentences—addresses this issue in the terms that we find\n\nconclusive:     “In their Brief, Appellants concede that the [CPSL] does not\n\ncreate    a   private    cause     of   action       against   Appellees.

We agree.5\n\n       That being said, Appellees’ arguments suggest that Appellants’ claims,\n\neven if framed as common-law medical malpractice, necessarily depend\n\nupon the existence of a civil remedy under the CPSL.                Appellees in effect\n\nassert that Appellants may not obtain the benefit of their artful pleading in\n\nseeking to invent a private cause of action that the legislature implicitly\n\ndeclined to create.

Appellants elaborate that, “[w]hile\nthe CPSL may not include an express private cause of action, [Appellants]\nhave not sought to recover under the statutory provisions of the CPSL.” Id.\nThis strikes us as a distinction without a difference. In any event, even if\nAppellants did not disavow any such claim, we would find it waived for want\nof argument in support of such a position. See Commonwealth v.

Furthermore, the CPSL does not expressly preclude civil\n\nliability for a failure to report abuse, nor immunize those who fail in their\n\nreporting obligations.\n\n       Consequently, for purposes of determining whether Appellants have\n\nstated a prima facie case of medical malpractice or negligence, we think it\n\nmost useful to evaluate the adequacy of Appellants’ showing in this regard\n\nas though the CPSL simply does not exist. Appellants claim not to rely upon\n\nit, and we find no reason in Pennsylvania law not to treat their asserted\n\ncommon-law claims as such.            If Appellants’ claims cannot stand without\n\nreference to the CPSL, our analysis would reveal that flaw. However, we do\n\nnot find that to be the case.\n\n       C.     Appellants Have Set Forth a Prima Facie Case of Medical\n              Malpractice.\n\n       We begin with the time-honored characterization of the standard that\n\ngoverns common-law medical malpractice claims:6\n\n       [W]hen a plaintiff’s medical            malpractice claim sounds in\n       negligence, the elements of the         plaintiff’s case are the same as\n       those in ordinary negligence             actions.     As such, medical\n       malpractice can be broadly              defined as the unwarranted\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6\n      At times, Appellants refer to their claims as ordinary negligence and in\nothers as sounding in medical malpractice. However, the substance of their\nclaims consists of assertions consistent with medical malpractice, and we\ntreat them exclusively as such. See Grossman v. Barke, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n566 (Pa.

Appellees owed the general duty of care to K.H.\n              that    arises  in    the    physician-patient\n              relationship.\n\n     Our Supreme Court has spoken eloquently of the nature of the duty\n\nowed by any one person to another:\n\n     In determining the existence of a duty of care, it must be\n     remembered that the concept of duty amounts to no more than\n     the sum total of those considerations of policy which led the law\n     to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection from\n     the harm suffered. . . . To give it any greater mystique would\n     unduly hamper our system of jurisprudence in adjusting to the\n     changing times. The late Dean Prosser expressed this view as\n     follows:\n\n\n                                    - 17 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n        These are shifting sands, and no fit foundation. There is a\n        duty if the court says there is a duty; the law, like the\n        Constitution, is what we make it. Duty is only a word with\n        which we state our conclusion that there is or is not to be\n        liability; it necessarily begs the essential question. When\n        we find a duty, breach and damage, everything has been\n        said.     The word serves a useful purpose in directing\n        attention to the obligation to be imposed upon the\n        defendant, rather than the causal sequence of events;\n        beyond that it serves none. In the decision whether or not\n        there is a duty, many factors interplay: [t]he hand of\n        history, our ideas of morals and justice, the convenience of\n        administration of the rule, and our social ideas as to where\n        the loss should fall. In the end the court will decide\n        whether there is a duty on the basis of the mores of the\n        community, always keeping in mind the fact that we\n        endeavor to make a rule in each case that will be practical\n        and in keeping with the general understanding of mankind.\n\n     Sinn v.

In\n\nconnection with duty, we are confronted with a trial court decision and\n\narguments by the Appellees reflecting an essential misapprehension by the\n\ntrial court and the Appellees, one that perhaps descends from many cases in\n\nwhich the distinction between duty and standard of care has been blurred\n\nwithout consequence when properly separating the two was less critical than\n\nit is in this case. Stated specifically and in brief, the trial court and Appellees\n\neffectively maintain that the question of duty must be stated in the\n\nparticular terms of the case presented. Thus, in the absence of an express\n\ncommon-law “duty” specifically to report suspected child abuse that has\n\nbeen recited in a prior controlling precedent, such a claim categorically is\n\nunavailable. However, to define the relevant duty in this case in that fashion\n\nimproperly imports into the duty inquiry questions pertaining to whether a\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 20 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nduty was breached, which is a question of fact as to which Appellants\n\npresented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n       In most cases, this distinction will be of little import, which is why our\n\nmedical malpractice case law tends to lack discussions that clearly segregate\n\nthese inquiries.       However, disentangling these principles is critical to\n\nresolving the issue presented: If the question is simply whether Appellees\n\nowed K.H., as their patient, a duty of reasonable care, then the necessity of\n\na duty clearly is satisfied. As our case law makes clear, a physician must\n\n“possess and employ in the treatment of a patient the skill and knowledge\n\nusually possessed by physicians in the same or a similar locality, giving due\n\nregard to the advanced state of the profession at the time of the treatment”\n\nand “is also required to exercise the care and judgment of a reasonable\n\nman.” Winschel, 925 A.2d at 196-97. However, if, as the trial court and\n\nAppellees maintain, the question is whether Appellees had a specific duty to\n\nreport suspicions of abuse, the absence of case law establishing such a duty\n\nlends at least some credence to Appellees’ claims that to vindicate\n\nAppellants’ view would create an entirely new form of liability, which this\n\nCourt does not regularly do.7\n____________________________________________\n\n\n7\n      Although ultimately we find this argument immaterial to our analysis,\nthe mere recognition of a viable basis for a tort claim that has not previously\nbeen presented to Pennsylvania courts should not be fatal per se to such a\nclaim.

Our decision was\n\ncouched in the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 324A (“Liability to Third\n\nPerson for Negligent Performance of Undertaking”), which provides that\n\n“[o]ne who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services\n\nto another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a\n\nthird person . . ., is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm\n\nresulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care . . . .”      Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 324A.          We noted that the “original undertaking,” i.e.,\n\n“entry into the physician-patient relationship for treatment purposes,”\n\nimposed upon the physician “the duty to exercise reasonable care.”\n\nMatharu v.

First, as noted, supra, the duty inquiry is a pure question\n\nof law.

However, we also have made clear that in all but\n\nextraordinary cases, establishing the applicable standard of care, or if one\n\nprefers, the contours of the general duty recognized in the first instance by\n\nthe court, requires expert testimony and presents a question of fact for the\n\njury. Joyce, 694 A.2d at 654-55. If we allow the trial court to import into\n\nthe duty inquiry a determination as to the precise standard of care at issue,\n\nand implicitly to decide on summary judgment that the standard has not\n\nbeen breached, we take from the jury its prescribed role in medical\n\nmalpractice cases.       The integrity of the time-honored delineation of what\n\nbelongs to the court and what belongs to the jury can be preserved only by\n\nseparating a physician’s general duty to his patient, the formulation of\n\nwhich arises simply from the inception of any physician-patient relationship,\n\nfrom the elucidation of how that duty is to be fulfilled in a given case, which\n\nconcerns the particular standard of care, and whether the defendant did so.\n\nThe latter inquiries require a jury determination. See id.9\n____________________________________________\n\n\n9\n       Even as they argue for the expanded account of what duty a trial court\nmust find as a matter of law before a case may proceed, Appellees LGH and\nDr. Kumar elsewhere appear to concede that the inquiry properly proceeds\nfrom the threshold question of law on to trial and jury consideration as we\nexplain herein. LGH, for example, notes that “a duty exists, as recognized\nby law as created by the physician/patient relationship, that requires the\nphysician to act in accordance with specific norms or standards established\nby the profession, commonly referred to as the standard of care.” Brief\nfor LGH at 20 (emphasis in original).

This error led the court to conclude that no common-law claim\n\nfor a failure to report would lie, when, in fact, the common-law claim that\n\nwas asserted is (or may be) merely a species of medical malpractice, albeit\n\none infrequently invoked, requiring expert testimony sufficient to enable a\n\njury to conclude that the standard of care applicable to Appellees in this case\n\nentailed an obligation to report suspicions of child abuse.          Appellants\n\nestablished Appellees’ general duty as soon as they established the\n\nundisputed physician-patient relationship between K.H. and all of the\n\nAppellees in this case. Thus, we now must consider whether Appellants set\n\nforth sufficient evidence as to each of the remaining elements of a medical\n\nmalpractice claim to establish a prima facie case for medical malpractice.\n\n          2.

Consequently, the only question is whether\n\nAppellants provided expert evidence that defined a standard of care\n\nrequiring reporting to a reasonable degree of medical certainty and asserted\n\na breach thereof with respect to each Appellee.             Appellants provided\n\nvoluminous evidence to precisely that effect.\n____________________________________________\n\n\n10\n      Here, too, it is clear that determining the standard of care is a task\nfirmly ensconced with the jury, not the court under the guise of satisfying\nthe threshold question of whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff.\n11\n       With the enactment of Pennsylvania’s Medical Care Availability and\nReduction of Error Act (“MCARE”), 40 P.S. §§ 1303.101, et seq., additional\nmandatory qualifying criteria were imposed upon the introduction of such\nexpert testimony. Because the parties to this matter do not dispute the\nqualifications of Appellants’ experts, the MCARE restrictions, which merely\nreinforce and give shape to the common-law expert testimony requirement\nthat preceded MCARE’s May 20, 2002 effective date, are not at issue.\n\n\n\n                                          - 27 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n     Eli H. Newberger, M.D., a board-certified pediatrician, Assistant\n\nProfessor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, and Adjunct in Pediatrics\n\nat Childen’s Hospital of Boston, rendered a lengthy report that touched upon\n\nthe standard of care governing Appellees, reviewed at length the medical\n\nhistory and records documenting Appellees’ treatment of K.H., and expressly\n\nrendered his opinions as to the standard of care and each physician’s\n\nindividual failures to satisfy that standard “to a reasonabl[e] degree of\n\nmedical certainty.”   Report of Eli H.

FF to Appellants’ Omnibus Memorandum of Law In\n\nOpposition to All Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (“Appellants’\n\nOmnibus Memorandum”), 9/27/2013 (hereinafter “Newberger Report”).\n\n     Dr. Newberger’s account of the standard of care was as follows:\n\n     As a matter of background, Pennsylvania’s child reporting\n     statute was harmonized with the model developed by the\n     American Bar Association commission on which I served in the\n     mid-1970’s.      Pursuant to the 1973 Federal Child Abuse\n     Prevention and Treatment Act, prior to their receiving their\n     monetary shares of the Congressional budgetary allocation for\n     the National Child Abuse Center in the Department of Health,\n     Education, and Welfare, states were required to conform their\n     reporting standards to the Federal model. The threshold for\n     reporting—reasonable cause or suspicion—was intentionally set\n     low in order to assure that children would be protected from\n     subsequent, more severe injuries than those initially reported.\n     Infant injuries and their frequently fatal or lasting consequences\n     were a particular focus of concern, and a national training\n     initiative assured that the reporting requirements and their\n     rationale were built into the training of medical students,\n     primary care physicians, and especially, pediatricians. Thus, the\n     standard of care for physicians in recognition and\n     reporting of child abuse has been incorporated into the\n     reporting statutes.\n\n                                   - 28 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nNewberger Report at 2 (emphasis added).12\n\n       Similarly, David Turkewitz, M.D., a board-certified pediatrician and,\n\ninter alia, Chairman of Pediatrics at York Hospital in York, Pennsylvania,\n\nDirector of Section Pediatric Emergency Medicine of the Department of\n\nEmergency Medicine,13 and clinical professor of pediatrics at Pennsylvania\n\nState University, averred that, “[i]n order to comply with the standard of\n\ncare a physician, particular[ly] a pediatrician, must appropriately recognize\n\nsigns and symptoms of abuse, diagnose that abuse, and report that abuse.”\n\nReport of David Turkewitz, M.D., undated, at 2, attached as Exh. HH to\n\nAppellants’    Omnibus       Memorandum        (hereinafter   “Turkewitz   Report”).\n\nDr. Turkewitz elaborated as follows:\n\n       [T]he obligation to report a suspicion of child abuse is the\n       standard of care governing any physician. This duty is also\n       mandated by statute in Pennsylvania (and elsewhere).       A\n____________________________________________\n\n\n12\n       The language emphasized in this passage and those that immediately\nfollow is important because, as worded, it suggests that the standard of care\nexisted separately from, and was later baked into, the model law upon which\nthe CPSL is founded, not that the statute supplied or supplanted the\nstandard of care. Moreover, no authority of which we are aware suggests\nthat, when a statute overlaps or is in conformity with a common-law\nstandard of care, or vice-versa, that standard of care no longer governs the\nphysician’s conduct independently of the statute. Even when they entirely\noverlap, the different standards of proof governing criminal and civil claims\nfor failure to report suggest otherwise: Under medical malpractice, a\nplaintiff need only establish a negligent breach of the standard of care by a\npreponderance of the evidence, while criminal liability, even for the same\nalleged conduct, requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a “willful”\nfailure to report.\n13\n       This title is per Dr. Turkewitz’s curriculum vitae.\n\n\n\n                                          - 29 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n       reasonable suspicion of abuse is exactly that: if after analysis of\n       decision[-]making components, there is a reasonable suspicion\n       of abuse, then the physician has a duty to report under\n       Pennsylvania mandating reporting requirements which is\n       encompassed in the standard of care. Reasonable suspicion\n       by no means requires a high degree of medical certainty. The\n       threshold for reporting is purposely set low to encourage\n       reporting of child abuse and to ensure children are protected\n       from additional abuse which can lead to further injury or death.\n       The goal is simple—protection of the child. . . . All physicians, in\n       accordance with the standard of care, must therefore\n       appropriately appreciate, assess, diagnose, and report signs and\n       symptoms of abuse.\n\nId. at 3 (emphasis added).14\n\n       In light of this expert evidence, it would be untenable to suggest that\n\nAppellants failed to adduce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding whether Appellees’ standard of care obligated them\n\nto report reasonable suspicions of child abuse to the appropriate authorities,\n\nindependently of a similar statutory obligation.\n\n              (b)    Appellants’ evidence raises a genuine\n                     issue of material fact regarding whether\n                     Appellees    breached    the   governing\n                     standard of care.\n\n       We now move on to review Appellants’ experts’ opinions regarding\n\neach Appellee-physician’s performance under the standard of care.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n14\n      Without exception, the other experts cited below, who are cited, infra,\nas attesting that one or more Appellees breached the standard of care,\nsimilarly aver that the standard of care imposes a reporting obligation\nindependently of the statute requiring same.

While she should have reported on September\n     12, 2002, each new injury thereafter provided even more reason\n     to report, and her failure to act in accordance with the standard\n     of care in assessment, diagnosis, and reporting of child abuse\n     served not only to deny this child the protection that he needed\n     and deserved, but enabled his abuser to continue to harm him.\n     Dr. Kumar was at the core of over three months of escalating\n     injuries to [K.H.] that were all suspicious of [sic] an ongoing\n     pattern of abuse to the child, as well as concerns by several\n     other physicians for abuse. Despite this, Dr. Kumar did nothing\n     to protect the child from further abuse and actually defended\n     against allegations of abuse by other physicians. This was a\n     gross deviation from the standard of care that had catastrophic\n     consequences of additional and more severe abuse that rendered\n     [K.H.] neurologically devastated.\n\nNewberger Report at 22; see Report of Herschel R.

Appellants have provided ample evidence to\n                 raise a jury question with respect to damages.\n\n       Because the adequacy of Appellants’ proffered expert evidence\n\nregarding the nature and scope of Appellants’ damages has not been\n\nchallenged on appeal, it is not necessary to address this issue at length. In\n\nthe interests of comprehensiveness, we simply note that Appellants\n____________________________________________\n\n\n15\n       Appellees make much of the proposition that they had no duty to third\nparties, or to control third parties. However, it is clearly the case that the\nduty asserted by Appellants was Appellees’ duty to K.H., which, at least in\nits broadest strokes, cannot be disputed. Appellees also argue at length that\ntheir duty extends only to diagnosis and treatment, and does not reach any\nobligation to report, a proposition flatly contradicted by several of\nAppellants’ experts. See, e.g., Brief for Smigocki at 31-33. Moreover, other\ncases, albeit distinguishable in various particulars, have established that a\nphysician’s duty to a patient or, in certain narrow circumstances, to a third\nparty, may reach outside the examination room.

Appellants’ evidence raises a genuine issue of\n                material fact regarding whether Appellees’\n                alleged breach of their respective standards of\n                care caused K.H.’s damages.\n\n      We now examine whether Appellants provided a prima facie showing\n\nthat Appellees’ alleged breaches of the applicable standards of care caused\n\nK.H.’s injuries. The trial court did not believe so, reasoning as follows:\n\n      [E]ven if [Appellees] owed a duty to [K.H.] to report a\n      reasonable suspicion that he was a victim of abuse, under the\n      circumstances of this case there is insufficient evidence of\n      causation for [Appellants’] negligence claims to proceed. In a\n      medical malpractice suit for negligence, the expert testimony\n      requirement “means that a plaintiff must present medical expert\n      testimony to establish that the care and treatment of the plaintiff\n      by the defendant fell short of the required standards of care and\n      that the breach proximately caused the plaintiff’s injury.”\n      Toogood, 824 A.2d at 1145. . . .

[K.H.] was not\n      injured as a result of any of the treatment he was given by\n      [Appellees]. Rather, [Appellants] allege that [Appellees] were\n      negligent merely for failing to discover and report the non-\n      medical source of [K.H.’s] condition. Even if [Appellees] had\n      reported a suspicion of child abuse to the appropriate\n      authorities, there is no way to prove that Lancaster County\n      Children and Youth Services would have definitely intervened\n      and removed [K.H.] from his home.                Suggesting that\n      [Appellees’] failure to report the abuse “could very [probably]”\n      account for [K.H.’s] injuries is insufficient as a matter of law.\n      [Appellants] are required to demonstrate to a reasonable degree\n      of medical certainty that [Appellees] caused [K.H.’s] injuries,\n      which they are unable to do in this case without engaging in\n      speculation and conjecture.\n\nT.C.O. at 20-21 (citations modified).\n\n      The trial court’s recitation of the standard is incomplete, because it\n\nwholly neglects to acknowledge, and arguably contravenes, Pennsylvania\n\ncase law recognizing the relaxed burden of proof reserved for cases in which\n\nit would be unreasonable and inequitable to demand that a plaintiff provide\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 36 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nconclusive evidence that the defendant is the direct and exclusive cause of\n\nthe harm alleged.

In\n       adopting this principle, the Hamil Court reasoned:\n\n          In light of our interpretation of [subs]ection 323(a),[ 16] it\n          follows that where medical causation is a factor in a case\n          coming within that Section,[17] it is not necessary that the\n          plaintiff introduce medical evidence in addition to that\n          already adduced to prove defendant’s conduct increased\n          the risk of harm—to establish that the negligence asserted\n          resulted in plaintiff’s injury. Rather, once the jury is\n          apprised of the likelihood that defendant’s conduct resulted\n          in plaintiff’s harm, [subsection 323(a)] leaves to the jury,\n          and not the medical expert, the task of balancing\n          probabilities.\n\n       Hamil, 392 A.2d at 1288.                Subsequently, our high court\n       explained:\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n16\n       Negligent Performance of Undertaking to Render Services\n\n       One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render\n       services to another which he should recognize as necessary for\n       the protection of the other's person or things, is subject to\n       liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure\n       to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if\n\n          (a) his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of\n          such harm . . . .\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 323(a).\n17\n      We have held that subsection 323(a) applies, inter alia, to failure-to-\ndiagnose cases.

Although timely\n        detection of breast cancer may well reduce the likelihood\n        that the patient will have a terminal result, even with\n        timely detection and optimal treatment, a certain\n        percentage of patients unfortunately will succumb to the\n        disease. This statistical factor, however, does not preclude\n        a plaintiff from prevailing in a lawsuit. Rather, once there\n        is testimony that there was a failure to detect the cancer in\n        a timely fashion, and such failure increased the risk that\n        the woman would have either a shortened life expectancy\n        or suffered harm, then it is a question for the jury whether\n        they believe, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\n        acts or omissions of the physician were a substantial factor\n        in bringing about the harm.

Because the suspected abuse involved “serious\n\nphysical injury,” Dr. Breitenstein indicated, the children and youth agency\n\n“would also have notified the District Attorney,” and “a detective or other\n\nlaw enforcement officer designated by the county district attorney would\n\nhave collaborated with [Children and Youth Services (“CYS”)] and been\n\ninvolved with the interviews and the investigation.” Id.

The CPSL provides that the child may\n      be taken into custody pursuant to a court order or by a law\n      enforcement officer or duly authorized court officer if there are\n      reasonable grounds to believe that the child is suffering from\n      illness or injury or is in imminent danger from his surroundings\n      and his removal is necessary. From September 9, 2002 until\n      December 18, 2002, [K.H.] suffered from severe injuries (rib\n      fractures, vertebral compressions, rapid increase in head size, as\n      well as bruising and scratches) and given his age and\n      vulnerability to future abuse he would certainly be considered to\n      be in imminent danger.        Therefore, either the investigating\n      officer or detective would have taken protective custody or\n      the CYS worker would have sought a court order for\n      protective custody if the perpetrator was unknown and/or\n      had not been arrested.\n\nId. at 5 (emphasis added). Given Dr. Breitenstein’s credentials, experience,\n\nand the detail and certainty with which he asserted his conclusions regarding\n\ncausation, the trial court’s conclusion that, “[e]ven if [Appellees] had\n\nreported a suspicion of child abuse to the appropriate authorities, there is no\n\nway to prove that [CYS] would have definitely intervened,” T.C.O. at 21,\n\nappears to us to be a patent usurpation upon the sort of determination of\n\n                                    - 42 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nfact   that   belongs    with    a   jury.     Dr. Breitenstein   outlined   what   he\n\ncharacterized as mandatory protocols observed by children and youth\n\nagencies in every county in Pennsylvania that essentially guaranteed some\n\nsignificant degree of intervention upon a report of K.H.’s symptoms.19\n____________________________________________\n\n\n19\n       Appellees, Dr. Kumar in particular, attempt to cast Dr. Breitenstein’s\ntestimony as wholly conjectural, opining that he cannot presume to know\nhow CYS would have responded to a report under these circumstances. The\nstrongest rebuttal of this argument is Dr. Breitenstein’s report, which not\nonly outlines his extensive experience in responding to these requests, but\nalso outlines mandatory events that would follow a report of this nature as\nwell as testifying with a reasonable degree of professional certainty that\nproper reports in this case would have resulted in a heightened degree of\nscrutiny, and a more rapid response, then reports of lesser harm.\nFurthermore, Dr. Kumar’s resort to Kovach v. Central Trucking, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. Super. 2002), for the proposition that “no matter how skilled\nor experienced the expert witness may be, he will not be permitted to guess\nor to state a judgment based on mere conjecture,” does her argument no\nfavors, given our ruling in that case. See Brief for Kumar at 32 (quoting\nKovach, 808 A.2d at 959). In Kovach, we reversed a trial court ruling\nexcluding a physician-expert’s testimony upon the basis that it was\nspeculative. Specifically, we determined that the trial court should not have\nexcluded the expert’s testimony regarding whether the accident sued-upon\nresulted in the plaintiff’s knee injuries, even though the expert admitted that\nhe could not be certain about the condition of the plaintiff’s knees before the\naccident, or whether the injuries complained of were entirely a result of the\naccident or constituted an aggravation of a pre-existing injury. Nonetheless,\nbecause the expert testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that\nthe accident had been a substantial cause, if not the only cause, of the\nplaintiff’s injuries, we ruled that the trial court should have admitted the\ntestimony. 808 A.2d at 959-61. We read Dr. Breitenstein’s testimony as\nneither less certain nor more qualified or conjectural than the expert’s in\nKovach. Consequently, his testimony certainly provided sufficient support\nwith regard to causation to avoid summary judgment in the instant case.\n       Dr. Siwek also attacks the sufficiency of Dr. Breitenstein’s testimony.\nHowever, she does so almost entirely by quibbling with the assertions\ntherein. See Brief for Siwek at 15-18. Dr. Siwek’s alternative view of the\ncase has no place in a summary judgment proceeding; to the extent that we\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                          - 43 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n      In light of the liberal standard Pennsylvania courts are directed by\n\nHamil and its progeny to apply to increased-risk-of-harm cases where direct\n\ncausation cannot be established, and Appellants’ voluminous evidence,\n\nstated to a reasonable degree of medical or professional certainty, that\n\nAppellees’ acts or omissions substantially increased K.H.’s risk of harm, the\n\ntrial court simply applied too rigid a standard in finding that Appellants’\n\nevidence of causation was so speculative as to warrant dismissal.     To the\n\ncontrary, the causation evidence submitted by Appellants for precisely that\n\npurpose was a model of the sort of evidence that Hamil deemed sufficient to\n\nsupport a prima facie case of medical negligence.    Consequently, the trial\n\ncourt erred when it found Appellants’ causation evidence wanting.20\n\n      Having found, supra, that Appellants’ showings also were adequate to\n\nestablish jury questions regarding all four elements of medical malpractice,\n\nwe conclude that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Appellees.\n\n      D.     Appellants’ Entitlement to a Jury Instruction Regarding\n             Negligence Per Se Is Moot.\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\ndeem Dr. Breitenstein’s testimony to have been sufficiently certain to reach\na jury, we need only consider that testimony, viewing it in the light most\nfavorable to the Appellants.\n20\n      The trial court’s erroneous conclusions follow in part from a question-\nbegging premise. In ruling that K.H. “was not injured as a result of any\ntreatment,” the court implicitly assumed that the standard of care entails\nonly clinical treatment, and does not require reporting suspicions of abuse,\nwhich we have found involves a fact question to be determined by a jury.\n\n\n\n                                           - 44 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n      We now turn to Appellants’ third issue.     Appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred in determining that they are not entitled to a negligence per\n\nse jury instruction on the grounds that Appellees’ violation of the CPSL,\n\nwithout more, would suffice to establish a breach of Appellees’ duty for\n\npurposes of setting forth claims of medical malpractice, leaving the jury after\n\nsuch a finding to assess only proximate causation and damages. We need\n\nnot resolve this issue, for two reasons.\n\n      First, whether to provide a negligence per se instruction is not typically\n\na matter that is disposed of in a motion for summary judgment, insofar as\n\nits propriety most often is a matter to be measured against the evidence\n\nadduced at trial. Second, the trial court’s ruling on this matter was based in\n\npart upon premises that we have rejected above. Thus, the court may rule\n\ndifferently in light of our analysis of those premises and the parties’\n\npresentations of the evidence at trial. Because this issue was prematurely\n\naddressed, and presently is moot, we leave its final disposition for the trial\n\ncourt in the first instance, without prejudice to Appellants’ entitlement to\n\nraise the issue in a future post-trial appeal, should the trial court again\n\nreject their request for such an instruction.\n\n      E.    Appellants Have Set Forth a Cognizable Claim for\n            Corporate Negligence Against LGH.\n\n      Finally, we consider Appellants’ argument that the trial court erred in\n\ndismissing their claims against LGH for corporate negligence. The following\n\nstandard governs:\n\n\n                                     - 45 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n      Corporate negligence is a doctrine under which the hospital is\n      liable if it fails to uphold the proper standard of care owed the\n      patient, which is to ensure the patient’s safety and well-being\n      while at the hospital.         This theory of liability creates a\n      nondelegable duty which the hospital owes directly to a patient.\n      Therefore, an injured party does not have to rely on and\n      establish the negligence of a third party.\n\n      The hospital’s duties have been classified into four general\n      areas: (1) a duty to use reasonable care in the maintenance of\n      safe and adequate facilities and equipment—Chandler Gen.\n      Hosp.

The trial court rejected these claims for the\n\nfollowing reasons:\n\n      [Appellants’ claim regarding retention of radiographs] falls under\n      the hospital’s duty to “adopt and enforce rules and policies to\n      ensure quality care for the patient[.” Appellants] have failed to\n\n\n                                    - 46 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n     produce any specific policies or procedures that address LGH’s\n     method for storing and organizing patients’ past radiological\n     studies. Moreover, neither [Appellants], nor Dr. Oestreich in his\n     report, claim that having had access to [K.H.’s] prior studies\n     would have assisted Dr. Mack and Dr. Smigocki in interpreting\n     the radiographic studies in question.     Instead, Dr. Oestreich\n     asserts that the studies would have assisted the radiologists in\n     diagnosing child abuse. Since the [trial c]ourt has already\n     determined that Pennsylvania does not impose a duty upon\n     physicians to report suspected child abuse, even if Drs. Mack\n     and Smigocki had determined that [K.H.] was being abused,\n     they would not have been under a statutory or common[-]law\n     duty to report it.\n\n     Finally, [Appellants] assert that, in employing Dr. Mack, LGH\n     “failed to employ a pediatric radiologist [who] was adequately\n     trained, experienced and qualified in reading pediatric\n     radiographs and the recognition of abuse[.”] (Oestreich Report,\n     [Appellants’]    Exhibit   TT    [to   Omnibus    Memorandum].)\n     Specifically, Appellants point to the fact that, in her deposition\n     testimony, Dr. Mack stated that she primarily read breast\n     imaging studies, was the chief of the mammography section, and\n     did not have a special[ty] in reading pediatric radiographs. As\n     demonstrated by her Curriculum Vitae, Dr. Mack completed a\n     Pediatric Radiology Fellowship at Children’s Medical Center in\n     Dallas, Texas[,] from 1994 to 1995. . . . Additionally, she is\n     Board Certified in Radiology with a “Certificate of Added\n     Qualifications in Pediatric Radiology[.”] Given these credentials,\n     there is absolutely no question that Dr. Mack was qualified to\n     read K.H.’s studies.\n\nT.C.O. at 26.\n\n     We begin with the trial court’s latter rationale.   In response to the\n\ndetermination that “there is absolutely no question that Dr. Mack was\n\nqualified to read [K.H.’s] studies,” Appellant argues that the trial court\n\nessentially resolved a material question of fact best left to the jury in\n\naccepting Dr. Mack’s CV as evidence conclusive of her qualifications despite\n\nDr. Mack’s testimony that her principal responsibilities at the relevant time\n\n\n                                   - 47 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\ninvolved mammography rather than pediatric radiology.          The trial court\n\nprovided no additional support to suggest that this was a determination\n\nappropriately resolved by the court rather than by a jury. However strongly\n\nDr. Mack’s CV might militate in favor of finding that she was qualified, we\n\nfind no principled basis not to have allowed the jury to resolve the\n\ndiscrepancy.   On summary judgment, as our governing standard makes\n\nclear, all doubts are to be resolved in favor of the non-moving party. The\n\ntrial court’s conclusion in this regard is inconsistent with the governing\n\nstandard.   Accordingly, to the extent the trial court’s ruling on corporate\n\nnegligence depended on this finding, we reject it.\n\n      With respect to the trial court’s first rationale, Appellants aptly note\n\nthat the trial court expressly relied upon its own finding that no civil remedy\n\nfor a failure to reporting child abuse would lie under the CPSL or the\n\ncommon law.     Insofar as we have rejected the trial court’s ruling in this\n\nregard, that rationale will not stand.\n\n      Appellants further argue that the trial court’s determination that they\n\n“failed to produce any specific policies or procedures that address LGH’s\n\nmethod for storing and organizing patients’ past radiological studies” proves,\n\nrather than undermines, their claim, insofar as their allegations that LGH\n\nwas negligent inhered in the absence of such policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 48 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\n       In support of this claim, Appellants cite the following exchange from\n\nDr. Smigocki’s deposition testimony:21\n\n       Q.     Is there somebody in your office that you would ask or—\n\n       A.     Our office? No. It would be a hospital record.\n\n       Q.     Is there somebody at the hospital that you would ask?\n\n       A.     The film library.\n\n       Q.     Is there a person that’s currently a custodian or at the film\n       library that you would ask?\n\n       A.     No.\n\n       Q.    When you reviewed and interpreted the December 6th,\n       2002, ultrasound, you had whatever information was written on\n       the order form; correct?\n\n       A.     I would assume.\n\n       Q.     Okay. And you also had any previous studies; correct?\n\n       A.     Possibly.\n\n       Q.     Why do you say “possibly”?\n\n       A.     Well, previous studies are not always available.\n\n       Q.   Okay. And what are the range of reasons why they\n       wouldn’t be available?\n\n       A.     Sometimes they can’t be located. Sometimes—\n\n       Q.     Like, if they’re lost?\n\n       A.    They could be lost. They could be misplaced. They could\n       be in a referring clinician’s trunk.\n____________________________________________\n\n\n21\n      This excerpt starts in medias res, a product of Appellants’ election to\nattach only excerpts of the deposition transcript to their Omnibus\nMemorandum. However, there is sufficient context to understand the thrust\nof Appellants’ contentions and the degree to which Dr. Smigocki’s testimony\nsupports them.\n\n\n\n                                          - 49 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n     Q.    If they were lost or misplaced or in a referring clinician’s\n     trunk, there would still be a record of the fact that they had\n     existed; correct?\n\n     A.    Presumably.\n\n     Q.   Okay. So you would have available to you at least a list of\n     what previous studies there were.\n\n     A.    Yes.\n\n     Q.     And if it turned out that you wanted to review a previous\n     study, but it wasn’t in the—it would have been electronic or in\n     the film jacket?\n\n     A.    I don’t know how it was back in 2002.\n\nNotes of Deposition Testimony—Gene Smigocki, 10/4/2012, at 85-86.\n\n     Even if we assume that this testimony, standing alone, provides only\n\nlimited support for the proposition that LGH did not have an appropriate\n\nrecords policy, one that might have enabled Drs. Mack or Smigocki to\n\nconduct a clinically appropriate comparative review of K.H.’s radiographs\n\nwith former studies, once again it usurps the trial court’s function to pass\n\njudgment on the weight of this evidence in reviewing a motion for summary\n\njudgment. This testimony provides a modicum of support for the proposition\n\nthat LGH’s records policy was either inadequate, or inadequately conveyed\n\nto physicians with LGH privileges, such that corporate negligence might lie\n\nfor a breach of LGH’s “duty to formulate, adopt and enforce adequate rules\n\nand policies to ensure quality care for the patients.” See Thompson, 591\n\nA.2d at 707. In his report, Dr. Oestreich noted that it was “unfortunate that\n\nDr. Mack failed to review the chest x-ray from [K.H.’s] birth. To the extent\n\nthat it was not made available to her, the hospital/practice group should\n\n\n                                   - 50 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nhave had a practice in place for the prior films to be available for review.”\n\nOestreich Report at 8. This, viewed in tandem with Dr. Smigocki’s equivocal\n\ntestimony regarding LGH’s policies for retaining prior scans, sufficed to\n\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact, such that it was error for the trial\n\ncourt to grant summary judgment to LGH relative to Appellants’ claims for\n\ncorporate negligence.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n       In its contemporary form, the Hippocratic Oath sworn by aspiring\n\nphysicians in the United States provides, inter alia, that “I will remember\n\nthat I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human\n\nbeing, whose illness may affect the person’s family and economic stability.\n\nMy responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately\n\nfor the sick.” The Oath also provides that “I will prevent disease whenever I\n\ncan, for prevention is preferable to cure.” In its archaic form, the Oath also\n\nprovided that “I will keep [the sick] from harm and injustice.”22\n\n       These sound sentiments are embodied in the CPSL, it is true, but the\n\npotential harm that may befall children when their physicians fail to behave\n\naccording to professional reporting requirements vastly exceeds the harm\n\ninuring to the public. Children, like all individuals, find legal protection, and\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n22\n     For all quotations, see Bioethics, Johns Hopkins Sheradan Libraries &\nUniversity   Museums,     available    at   guides.library.jhu.edu/c.php?g=\n202502&p=1335752 (last reviewed June 26, 2015).\n\n\n\n                                          - 51 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\ngrounds for civil recourse, whenever a physician violates his or her duty of\n\ncare. That duty of care is determined not by the General Assembly but by\n\nthe community of physicians.       Irrespective of whether the legislature\n\nintended to imply a private right of action under the CPSL, it beggars belief\n\nthat, in enacting that statute, the General Assembly intended to immunize\n\nfrom civil redress violations of the standard of care so severe that the\n\nlegislature deemed them worthy of criminal punishment.       The anomaly is\n\ncast into relief even more stark when one considers that civil redress\n\nundisputedly remains available for far less egregious violations of that\n\nstandard of care.\n\n      We need not address on this day whether the CPSL itself furnishes\n\nsuch a remedy; Appellants do not argue that it does. Indeed, today we need\n\nnot decide whether, as Appellants allege, Appellees serially violated the\n\nstandard of care in passing K.H. amongst themselves while repeatedly\n\nsetting aside concerns that he was the victim of abuse. Nor need we decide\n\nwhether, in so doing, Appellees caused the crippling harm that eventually\n\nbefell K.H. at the hands of his biological father’s continuing abuse. Indeed,\n\nthe essence of our ruling is that it is not our place, nor that of the trial\n\njudge, to do so.    We need decide only whether the trial court improperly\n\nintruded upon Appellants’ right to have a jury hear testimony regarding the\n\nindependent obligations of the standard of care and testimony to the effect\n\nthat such violations, if any, substantially increased K.H.’s risk of harm over\n\nthe several months that K.H. presented to the various Appellees, allegedly\n\n                                    - 52 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nwith tell-tale signs of continuing abuse the nature of which was readily\n\ndetectable by those physicians. The trial court did precisely that, in violation\n\nof the governing standard.\n\n       Specifically, the trial court improperly ruled that Appellants failed to\n\npresent a prima facie case of medical malpractice against all six named\n\nAppellees who undertook K.H.’s care from September to December of 2002.\n\nThis includes both Appellants’ claims of malpractice predicated on the\n\nfailures to report suspicions of abuse as well as their claims against Dr. Mack\n\nand Dr. Smigocki, and the vicarious liability of Lancaster Radiology and LGH,\n\nfor malpractice associated with their review of K.H.’s radiographs.23 We also\n\nfind that Appellants have set forth a prima facie case of corporate negligence\n\nagainst LGH. Finally, we find that any decision regarding the propriety of a\n\nnegligence per se instruction would be premature and advisory, insofar as\n\nour other disposition and analyses of related issues render the matter moot\n\nat this time.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse in all aspects the trial court’s\n\nentry of summary judgment for Appellees and its dismissal with prejudice of\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n23\n       Because the trial court’s dismissal of these claims was based upon its\nfinding that Appellants could not seek damages for the failure to report that\nAppellants allege was, in part, a consequence of Drs. Mack and Smigocki’s\nmalpractice in this regard, our ruling that such claims will lie renders the\ntrial court’s disposition of these claims erroneous.\n\n\n\n                                          - 53 -\n\fJ-A08018-15\n\n\n\nAppellants’ amended complaint, and we remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n      Judgment reversed.
