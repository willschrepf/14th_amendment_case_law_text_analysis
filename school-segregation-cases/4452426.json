The trial\n                                                          court disregarded the two jury findings in favor of\n                                                          Anglo-Dutch and rendered a take-nothing\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                \n10A copy of the trial court’s order construing the Fee Agreement as a matter of law\nand applying that construction to stipulated facts is attached as Appendix E.\n\n11A copy of the trial court’s order granting interlocutory summary judgment against\nSwonke on his claims for breach of contract, declaratory judgment, and attorneys’\nfees is attached as Appendix F.\n\n12A copy of the jury verdict in the second trial is attached to the trial court’s final\njudgment which is attached as Appendix G.\n\n                                                                                           xvii\n\f                                                          judgment against Anglo-Dutch on its claims for\n                                                          trial, appellate, and post-remand attorneys’\n                                                          fees.13\n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n13A copy of the trial court’s May 13, 2014 judgment (“2014 Judgment”) is attached\nas Appendix G.\n\n                                                                     xviii\n\f           STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n     The cross-appellants request oral argument.

Did the trial court misconstrue the numerator and rounding\n              provisions of the Fee Agreement and erroneously order Anglo-\n              Dutch to pay Swonke $306,000 instead of $1,530,000?14\n\nII.           Did the trial court err by rendering judgment against—and\n              refusing to render judgment for—Swonke on his attorneys’ fees\n              claims?15\n\nIII.

Did the trial court err by rendering a judgment on prejudgment\n              interest, post-judgment interest, and costs that conflicts with its\n              2007 Judgment, which remains in force and effect on those\n              issues?17 \n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n14   This issue attacks judgment decrees 2(1), 4, 5, 6, and 9 in the 2014 Judgment.\n\n15   This issue attacks judgment decrees 8, 11, and 12 in the 2014 Judgment.\n\n16   This issue attacks judgment decree 7 in the 2014 Judgment.\n\n17   This issue attacks judgment decrees 13, 15, and 16 in the 2014 Judgment.\n\n                                                                      xx\n\f                      STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nI.   The Underlying Dispute\n\n     Gerard Swonke has been a lawyer for 41-years who was “of\n\ncounsel” to Greenberg Peden, P.C. or its predecessor from 1987 until\n\nNovember 2001. 1 CR 248-250, 1 CR 258. Scott Van Dyke worked for\n\nVan Dyke Energy Company (later Vanco Energy Company), his father’s\n\noil company, where he spent 50% of his time negotiating and preparing\n\ncontracts. Swonke first met Van Dyke in 1987 through Van Dyke’s\n\nfather. 1 CR 251-253. Soon thereafter, Swonke began to represent Van\n\nDyke’s father’s company. 1 CR 253.\n\n     In 1989, Van Dyke and his mother formed Anglo-Dutch Petroleum\n\nInternational, Inc., an exploration company. 1 CR 168-171. Van Dyke\n\nserved as its president. 1 CR 185-186. Beginning in 1993, Van Dyke\n\nbecame the chief architect and negotiator of an elaborate limited\n\nliability agreement that brought together disparate investor interests\n\nfrom several countries to pursue a license in Kazakhstan for the\n\ndevelopment of the Tenge oil and gas field. 1 CR 230, 257. Swonke\n\ndrafted the formal documents and obtained the assistance of Skip\n\nNaylor, a Greenberg Peden shareholder, to help document the\n\n\n\n                                  1\n\ftransaction. 1 CR 231, 257. Anglo-Dutch (Tenge) L.L.C. was the entity\n\nformed to complete the transaction. See 1 CR 231.\n\n       In   1997,   Swonke   negotiated   and   drafted   confidentiality\n\nagreements that Halliburton and Ramco executed in order to view\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s confidential data regarding the Tenge field to assess a\n\nproposed buyout of Anglo-Dutch’s existing partners. 1 CR 172-175. In\n\nFebruary 2000, Anglo-Dutch requested that Swonke examine the\n\nviability of a potential lawsuit against Halliburton and Ramco for\n\nbreaching the confidentiality agreements. 1 CR 187, 260-261. Swonke\n\nconcluded a lawsuit was viable and so advised Anglo-Dutch. 1 CR 188,\n\n262.\n\n       Although Anglo-Dutch wished to pursue the lawsuit, it did not\n\nhave the financial resources to do so on an hourly basis. 1 CR 176.\n\nAnglo-Dutch owed Greenberg Peden a large sum of money. 1 CR 221.\n\nFor that reason, Greenberg Peden previously had decided and told Van\n\nDyke that it would no longer represent Anglo-Dutch in any matters. 1\n\nCR 208-209, 225-226, 258-259, 232-234.      Nevertheless, as required\n\nunder Swonke’s “of counsel” agreement with Greenberg Peden, Swonke\n\nfirst approached Greenberg Peden and asked if it would represent\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\fAnglo-Dutch against Halliburton and Ramco. 1 CR 232-233, 217, 235 ¶\n\n8. Greenberg Peden flatly refused. 1 CR 218-220, 222-226, 232-233,\n\n235, 237-238, 241-242. Swonke and David Peden, a named shareholder\n\nof Greenberg Peden, both informed Van Dyke that Greenberg Peden\n\nwould not represent it against Halliburton and Ramco, a fact even Van\n\nDyke concedes. 1 CR 188, 208-209, 225-226, 233, 237-238, 241-243.\n\n     Swonke then referred the case to McConn & Williams without\n\nseeking a referral fee. 1 CR 263. McConn & Williams signed a fee\n\nagreement with Anglo-Dutch on March 25, 2000 and filed Anglo-Dutch\n\n(Tenge) L.L.C., et al. v. Ramco Oil & Gas, Ltd., et al.; in the 61st Judicial\n\nDistrict Court of Harris County, Texas, Cause No. 2000-22588\n\n(“Halliburton Lawsuit”) on May 2, 2000.          1 CR 318-325, 177-178.\n\nMcConn & Williams later associated with John O’Quinn to try the case.\n\n1 CR 236.\n\n     After Anglo-Dutch hired McConn & Williams, Van Dyke and\n\nMcConn & Williams’ lawyers frequently asked Swonke for advice and to\n\nperform tasks on the Halliburton Lawsuit even though at that time\n\nSwonke had no agreement with Anglo-Dutch or McConn & Williams by\n\nwhich he would be paid for his efforts. 1 CR 264-266. After several\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\fmonths of such requests, Swonke finally concluded that he had to be\n\ncompensated if he was going to continue to work on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit. 1 CR 266.\n\n       Van Dyke called Swonke and specifically asked to retain him, not\n\nGreenberg Peden, to work on the Halliburton Lawsuit on a contingent\n\nfee because he could not afford to pay Swonke by the hour. 1 CR 267-\n\n268. Van Dyke suggested a contingency fee based on a formula. 1 CR\n\n268.    Swonke and Anglo-Dutch agreed to Van Dyke’s terms, which\n\nSwonke dictated into a Dictaphone. 1 CR 269-271. Swonke then asked\n\nhis secretary to transcribe his dictation and finalize the document. 1\n\nCR 272.\n\n       The body of the Fee Agreement never mentions Greenberg Peden.\n\n1 CR 312. Instead, the body of the Fee Agreement exclusively uses the\n\npersonal pronouns “I”, “me”, and “my” twelve times in a nine-sentence\n\ncontract to refer to Swonke, individually, and his rights and obligations\n\nunder the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 312-313.\n\n       Swonke’s secretary inadvertently put the Fee Agreement on\n\nGreenberg Peden letterhead and inserted “GREENBERG PEDEN, P.C.”\n\ninto the signature block.    1 CR 272.    Swonke then signed the Fee\n\n\n\n                                   4\n\fAgreement on October 16, 2000, never noticing the references to\n\nGreenberg Peden in the letterhead and in the signature block. 1 CR\n\n273, 312. Van Dyke signed the Fee Agreement the next day for Anglo-\n\nDutch. 1 CR 313.\n\n     Swonke had no intention to, did not, and could not—because of\n\nGreenberg Peden’s prohibition on doing work for Anglo-Dutch—act for\n\nGreenberg Peden by signing the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 207. Instead,\n\nSwonke signed the contract for himself individually. 1 CR 282. Swonke\n\nhas never signed a contingency fee contract on behalf of Greenberg\n\nPeden. 1 CR 215. Indeed, when Greenberg Peden signs a contingency\n\nfee contract with a client, a Greenberg Peden attorney executes the fee\n\nagreement. 1 CR 211. Greenberg Peden had flatly refused to represent\n\nAnglo-Dutch in the Halliburton Lawsuit and told Van Dyke so—thus,\n\nSwonke had no authority to sign the Fee Agreement on behalf of\n\nGreenberg Peden, a fact known by Van Dyke. 1 CR 188, 208-209, 218-\n\n220, 222-226, 232-233, 235, 237-238, 241-243.      Naylor, Greenberg\n\nPeden’s managing shareholder, agreed that Swonke did not execute the\n\nFee Agreement on behalf of Greenberg Peden. 1 CR 239-240.\n\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\f     After signing the Fee Agreement, Swonke worked on the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit for 277 hours while physically present at\n\nGreenberg Peden’s offices. 1 CR 216. On October 26, 2001, Swonke\n\nbecame “of counsel” to McConn & Williams. 1 CR 347-350. Swonke\n\ninformed Anglo-Dutch that he was taking its files, including the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit, with him to his “of counsel” position at McConn &\n\nWilliams unless Anglo-Dutch objected. 1 CR 354. Anglo-Dutch did not\n\nobject. 1 CR 193-194. Because Swonke was to be compensated for his\n\nwork on the Halliburton Lawsuit under the Fee Agreement, Swonke’s\n\n“of counsel” agreement with McConn & Williams provided that McConn\n\n& Williams would not share any fees with Swonke that it derived from\n\nthe Halliburton Lawsuit.     See 1 CR 349.       With Anglo-Dutch’s\n\nknowledge, Swonke then worked 1,022 hours on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit while “of counsel” at McConn & Williams. 1 CR 206.\n\n     On May 7, 2002, six months after Van Dyke learned that Swonke\n\nhad physically left Greenberg Peden to become “of counsel” to McConn\n\n& Williams, Van Dyke was deposed in the Halliburton Lawsuit. Van\n\nDyke expressly testified that Anglo-Dutch had a fee agreement with\n\nSwonke. 1 CR 195, 247. Van Dyke did not remotely suggest during his\n\n\n\n                                  6\n\fdeposition that Anglo-Dutch had a fee agreement with Greenberg\n\nPeden. 1 CR 195.\n\n     The jury in the Halliburton Lawsuit rendered a $70,500,000\n\nverdict for Anglo-Dutch against Halliburton and Ramco.       1 CR 179.\n\nHalliburton and Ramco then stipulated that Anglo-Dutch incurred\n\nreasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees of $9,800,000. 1 CR 192. The\n\nattorneys’ time for which Anglo-Dutch recovered attorneys’ fees\n\nincluded the 1,022 hours that Swonke worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit while “of counsel” to McConn & Williams. 1 CR 204, 216.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch eventually settled with Halliburton for $51,000,000\n\non April 1, 2004, and Halliburton funded the settlement on April 15,\n\n2004. 1 CR 180, 378. During this period, Swonke repeatedly emailed\n\nVan Dyke about the calculation of his fee, directed Van Dyke’s attention\n\nto the fact that Swonke’s wiring instructions were not included with\n\nthose of other attorneys who received their fees directly from\n\nHalliburton, and asked Van Dyke to promptly address “my contract.” 1\n\nCR 364, 368, 373, 383. Van Dyke never suggested in response to these\n\ncommunications that he believed Swonke was not a party to the Fee\n\nAgreement. See 1 CR 205, 279. Instead, Van Dyke expressed concern\n\n\n\n                                   7\n\fthat Greenberg Peden may make a claim for a fee because the Fee\n\nAgreement was on Greenberg Peden letterhead. To address Van Dyke’s\n\nconcern and at his request, on April 16, 2004, before this lawsuit was\n\nfiled, Swonke obtained an assignment from Greenberg Peden of any\n\nrights it had under the Fee Agreement. See 1 CR 385.\n\n       On April 20, 2004, Van Dyke met with a lawyer and discussed\n\nissues related to Swonke. 1 CR 183. On April 22, 2004, Swonke met\n\nwith Van Dyke and, for the first time, Van Dyke asserted that the Fee\n\nAgreement is between Anglo-Dutch and Greenberg Peden, shocking\n\nSwonke. 1 CR 274-275, 280. Swonke left the meeting, telling Van Dyke\n\n“I can’t believe you’re going to do this to me and my family.” 1 CR 281.\n\nSeveral hours later, Anglo-Dutch sued Swonke, asserting that Anglo-\n\nDutch’s Fee Agreement was with Greenberg Peden, not Swonke. 1 CR\n\n286.\n\n       Like it did with Swonke’s Fee Agreement, Anglo-Dutch also\n\nattempted to avoid numerous other contracts that required it to share\n\nthe settlement from the Halliburton Lawsuit.      For example, Anglo-\n\nDutch executed 33 contracts that would have required it to pay\n\napproximately $11,000,000 of the settlement to investors in the\n\n\n\n                                   8\n\fHalliburton Lawsuit. 1 CR 196-199. However, Van Dyke did not pay\n\nany of the investors the amount they contracted for, thereby saving $4-5\n\nmillion. 1 CR 198, 200. Like Swonke, at least eight of the investors\n\nsuccessfully sued Anglo-Dutch for breach of contract. See, e.g., Anglo-\n\nDutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v. Smith, 243 S.W.3d 776 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied); Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l,\n\nInc. v. Littlemill Ltd., No. 14-06-00921-CV, 2007 WL 2826900 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] Oct. 2, 2007, pet. denied); Anglo-Dutch\n\nPetroleum Int’l, Inc. v. Haskell, 193 S.W.3d 87 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2007, pet. denied).\n\nII.     The Trial Court—Part I\n\n        Anglo-Dutch sued Swonke and Greenberg Peden for a declaratory\n\njudgment, negligence, gross negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary\n\nduty.     1 CR 286-290.      Anglo-Dutch sought the following seven\n\ndeclarations regarding the Fee Agreement:\n\n           the Fee Agreement is between Anglo-Dutch and Greenberg\n            Peden, and not between Anglo-Dutch and Swonke,\n            individually;\n\n           Greenberg Peden’s April 16, 2004 assignment of its rights\n            and interest in the Fee Agreement to Swonke is illegal and\n            unenforceable against Anglo-Dutch;\n\n\n\n                                   9\n\f        the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula in the\n         Fee Agreement is the hours Greenberg Peden worked on the\n         Halliburton Lawsuit and does not include the hours Swonke\n         worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to\n         McConn & Williams;\n\n        the hours Swonke worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit while\n         of counsel to McConn & Williams are included in the\n         denominator in the fee formula in the Fee Agreement;\n\n        the rounding up to the next whole percentage that is\n         required by the Fee Agreement occurs after the hours ratio\n         is determined and before, not after, the hours ratio is\n         multiplied by 20%.\n\n        the contingency fee owed under the Fee Agreement shall\n         remain in direct correlation to McConn & Williams’\n         contingency fee percentage—whether the McConn &\n         Williams contingency fee percentage increases or decreases;\n         and\n\n        neither Swonke nor Greenberg Peden can recover any\n         contingency fee under the Fee Agreement from any future\n         recovery against Ramco.\nSee 1 CR 286-287.    In addition, Anglo-Dutch sought fee forfeiture,\n\nactual damages, exemplary damages, and attorneys’ fees. 1 CR SUPP\n\n114. Swonke counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment, for breach of\n\ncontract against Anglo-Dutch, and for fraud against both Anglo-Dutch\n\nand Van Dyke. 1 CR 293-294. Swonke sought actual damages and\n\nattorneys’ fees. 1 CR SUPP 100.\n\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\f     After two weeks of testimony, the jury found in response to\n\nQuestion 1 that the Fee Agreement with Anglo-Dutch was entered into\n\non behalf of Swonke, individually, and not on behalf of Greenberg\n\nPeden. See 1 CR 303. In response to Question 2, the jury found that\n\nAnglo-Dutch breached the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 304. The jury found in\n\nresponse to Question 3 that $1,000,000 would fairly and reasonably\n\ncompensate Swonke for his damages that resulted from Anglo-Dutch’s\n\nbreach of the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 305. In response to Question 5, the\n\njury found that Swonke complied with his fiduciary duty to Anglo-\n\nDutch. 1 CR 306. Finally, the jury found in response to Question 9 that\n\nVan Dyke did not commit fraud against Swonke. 1 CR 307.\n\n     The trial court rendered judgment on the jury’s verdict on\n\nJanuary 22, 2007 (the “2007 Judgment”). 1 CR 298. That judgment\n\nordered Anglo-Dutch to take nothing from Swonke and Greenberg\n\nPeden.   1 CR 298.    The judgment also ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay\n\nSwonke $1,000,000 and prejudgment interest on that amount of\n\n$226,924.50.   1 CR 299.   Finally, the judgment also ordered Anglo-\n\nDutch to pay Swonke the following attorneys’ fees for the prosecution of\n\nhis breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims, and his defense\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\fof Anglo-Dutch’s declaratory judgment claims:      $352,892.50 for trial;\n\n$75,000 if Anglo-Dutch unsuccessfully appealed to the court of appeals;\n\nand $50,000 if Anglo-Dutch unsuccessfully appealed to the Texas\n\nSupreme Court. 1 CR 299.\n\nIII.   The Fourteenth Court of Appeals\n\n       On appeal to this Court, Anglo-Dutch complained only that: (1)\n\nthe Fee Agreement was unambiguously between Anglo-Dutch and\n\nGreenberg Peden, and should have been construed that way as a matter\n\nof law; (2) any ambiguity in the Fee Agreement should have been\n\nconstrued against Swonke; (3) the evidence was legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding in Question 1 that the Fee\n\nAgreement with Anglo-Dutch was entered into on behalf of Swonke,\n\nindividually, and not on behalf of Greenberg Peden; (4) the evidence\n\nwas legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s finding in\n\nQuestion 5 that Swonke complied with his fiduciary duty; (5) the trial\n\ncourt erroneously instructed the jury; and (6) the trial court erroneously\n\nadmitted evidence.

Specifically, this Court stated:\n\n     We hold that the October 16, 2000 fee agreement was\n     ambiguous with respect to whether Anglo–Dutch contracted\n     with Swonke individually or with Greenberg Peden. The\n     trial court properly refused to construe the ambiguous fee\n     agreement against Swonke and properly submitted this\n     issue to the jury. Legally and factually sufficient evidence\n     supports the jury's finding that Swonke individually is a\n     party to the fee agreement with Anglo–Dutch, and that\n     Greenberg Peden is not. Legally and factually sufficient\n     evidence supports the jury's finding that Swonke complied\n\n\n                                  14\n\f      with his fiduciary duty to Anglo–Dutch.

See 1 CR SUPP 197-213; 1 CR SUPP 226-296.\n\n     In a 5-4 decision, the Texas Supreme Court held that the Fee\n\nAgreement was unambiguously between Anglo-Dutch and Greenberg\n\nPeden. See Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l v. Greenberg Peden, P.C., 352\n\nS.W.3d 445, 453 (Tex. 2011).       The Texas Supreme Court’s opinion\n\nstates: “The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the case\n\nis remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                    16\n\fV.   The Trial Court—Part II\n\n     Upon remand, the trial court declared as a matter of law, among\n\nother declarations, that: (1) the rounding up to the next whole\n\npercentage that is required by the Fee Agreement occurs before the\n\nhours ratio is multiplied by 20%; (2) the numerator in the fee formula is\n\nthe hours Greenberg Peden spent on the Halliburton Lawsuit; and (3)\n\nAnglo-Dutch owed Swonke $306,000 under the Fee Agreement. 1 CR\n\n524-525.\n\n     The trial court also rendered an interlocutory summary judgment\n\nordering, among other things, that: (1) Swonke take nothing on his\n\nbreach of contract counterclaim; (2) Swonke take nothing on his request\n\nfor attorneys’ fees under chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code; (3) Swonke take nothing on his declaratory judgment\n\ncounterclaim; and (4) Swonke is precluded from recovering attorneys’\n\nfees under section 37.009 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode. 1 CR 668-669.\n\n     Finally, the Court held a three-day jury trial on the issues of\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s trial, appellate, and post-remand attorneys’ fees and\n\ncosts. 1 CR 1302. The jury answered “$0” nine times in response to\n\n\n\n                                   17\n\feleven subquestions in the jury charge. 1 CR 1309-1314. However, the\n\njury also found that $50,000 was a reasonable fee for the necessary\n\nservices of Anglo-Dutch’s attorneys for representation for the prior\n\nappeal to the Texas Supreme Court and that $12,000 was the\n\nreasonable and necessary costs that Anglo-Dutch incurred in its appeal\n\nto this Court and the Texas Supreme Court. 1 CR 1311, 1314. The trial\n\ncourt granted Swonke’s motion to disregard the jury’s findings on those\n\ntwo questions and also ruled that an award of attorneys’ fees or costs to\n\nAnglo-Dutch would not be equitable or just. 1 CR 1302.\n\n\n\n\n                                   18\n\f                  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n     Eleven years ago, Anglo-Dutch settled a lawsuit for $51,000,000\n\nand then refused to pay one of its lawyers, Swonke, the amount it had\n\nagreed to pay him.   Adding insult to injury, Anglo-Dutch then sued\n\nSwonke. Thus began this litigation odyssey.\n\n     A jury, a trial court (now Fourteenth Court of Appeals) judge,\n\nthree court of appeals justices, and four Texas Supreme Court justices\n\nfound that the parties’ Fee Agreement was between Anglo-Dutch and\n\nSwonke.   However, five justices on the Texas Supreme Court held\n\nthat—notwithstanding Greenberg Peden’s express refusal to represent\n\nAnglo-Dutch, and Van Dyke’s testimony that Anglo-Dutch had a fee\n\nagreement with Swonke—the Fee Agreement was between Anglo-Dutch\n\nand Greenberg Peden, not Swonke, as a matter of law.\n\n     On remand, Anglo-Dutch treated the Supreme Court’s declaration\n\nregarding the parties to the Fee Agreement as a panacea despite its\n\ninsignificance. Although the Supreme Court did not address or decide\n\nhow much money was owed under the Fee Agreement because Anglo-\n\nDutch did not appeal the take-nothing judgment on the declarations\n\nthat would have presented that issue, at Anglo-Dutch’s invitation the\n\n\n\n                                 19\n\ftrial court literally rewrote the Fee Agreement in contravention of its\n\nplain language and the Supreme Court’s opinion.       The trial court’s\n\nmistaken construction of the Fee Agreement resulted in a judgment for\n\nSwonke of $306,000 instead of the $1,530,000 the parties agreed he\n\nwould be paid.\n\n     The remainder of the trial court’s errors on remand resulted\n\nprimarily from its failure to acknowledge and apply a fundamental rule\n\nof appellate practice:   issues decided in a judgment that are not\n\nappealed are waived and not remanded for a second bite at the apple,\n\neven if the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded. In other\n\nwords, a trial court errs by rendering a judgment on remand that alters\n\nits own or a higher court’s prior judgment on an issue that was not\n\nappealed because the waived judgment on the issue remains in force\n\nand effect.   This waiver doctrine serves judicial economy by forcing\n\nparties to raise issues whose resolution might spare the courts and\n\nparties successive rounds of remands and appeals.\n\n     The trial court ran afoul of the waiver doctrine by rendering\n\ndeclarations on remand which had previously been sought, refused by\n\nthe 2007 Judgment, and not appealed.        Similarly, the trial court\n\n\n\n                                  20\n\fawarded Swonke attorneys’ fees, pre- and post-judgment interest, and\n\ncosts in its 2007 Judgment that were not appealed. Nevertheless, the\n\ntrial court erroneously eliminated or altered those awards on remand.\n\n     Despite the trial court’s errors, Swonke had decided to forego an\n\nappeal to allow this litigation to end until forced to cross-appeal by\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s perfection of its appeal. A proper construction of the Fee\n\nAgreement and application of the waiver doctrine will allow a lawyer\n\nwho helped enrich his client to get paid the agreed amount for his\n\nservices and end this litigation once and for all.\n\n                               ARGUMENT\n\nI.   The Trial Court Erred By Misconstruing The Numerator And\n     Rounding Provisions Of The Fee Agreement, And By Ordering\n     Anglo-Dutch To Pay Swonke $306,000 Instead Of $1,530,000\n     Under The Fee Agreement.\n\n     On remand, the trial court construed the Fee Agreement as a\n\nmatter of law and ruled, among other things, that: (1) the numerator in\n\nthe fee formula is the hours Greenberg Peden spent on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit, and does not include the hours Swonke worked on the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams; and (2)\n\nthe rounding up to the next whole percentage that is required by the\n\nFee Agreement occurs after the hours ratio is determined and before,\n\n\n                                     21\n\fnot after, the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%. See 1 CR 524-525; 1 CR\n\n1303. The trial court then applied its rulings in light of the parties’\n\nstipulations that: (a) Anglo-Dutch’s gross recovery in the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit was $51,000,000, (b) Swonke worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit for 277 hours while of counsel to Greenberg Peden; and (c)\n\nMcConn & Williams’ attorneys, and Swonke while of counsel to McConn\n\n& Williams, worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit for a total of 11,652\n\nhours. See 1 CR 524-525; 1 CR 1303-1304.\n\n     Based on its construction of the Fee Agreement and the parties’\n\nstipulations, the trial court rendered judgment:     (A) declaring the\n\nnumerator in the fee formula to be Greenberg Peden’s hours and not\n\nSwonke’s hours; (B) declaring that the rounding up required by the Fee\n\nAgreement occurs before the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%; and (C)\n\nordering Anglo-Dutch to pay Swonke $306,000 under the Fee\n\nAgreement. See 1 CR 525; 1 CR 1303-1304. As shown below, the trial\n\ncourt erred by rendering judgment on Anglo-Dutch’s requested\n\nnumerator and rounding declarations because Anglo-Dutch waived any\n\nentitlement to the declarations and, in any event, the declarations\n\nmisconstrue the Fee Agreement by rewriting its plain language in\n\n\n\n                                  22\n\fviolation of the Supreme Court’s opinion. These mistakes resulted in\n\nthe rendition of an incorrect judgment ordering Anglo-Dutch to pay\n\nSwonke $306,000 instead of $1,530,000 under the Fee Agreement.\n\n     A.     Anglo-Dutch Waived The Declarations Regarding The\n            Numerator And Rounding Provisions Because The Trial\n            Court’s 2007 Judgment Denied That Relief And That Denial\n            Was Not Appealed.\n\n     The trial court decreed in its final judgment: “As requested in\n\nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Petition at 7 ¶ 23(c), the Court DECLARES\n\nthat . . . the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula in the Fee\n\nAgreement is the hours Greenberg Peden worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit and does not include the hours Swonke worked on the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams . . . .” 1 CR\n\n1303 ¶ 2.    The trial court also decreed in its final judgment:     “As\n\nrequested in Plaintiffs’ First Amended Petition at 7-8 ¶ 23(d), the Court\n\nDECLARES that the rounding up to the next whole percentage that is\n\nrequired by the Fee Agreement occurs after the hours ratio is\n\ndetermined [and] before, not after, the hours ratio is multiplied by\n\n20%.” See 1 CR 1303 ¶ 4.\n\n     However, Anglo-Dutch sought these same declarations in the first\n\ntrial, 1 CR SUPP 110-111 ¶¶ 23(c), 23(d), the trial court rendered a\n\n\n                                   23\n\ftake-nothing judgment on these requested declarations in its 2007\n\nJudgment, 1 CR SUPP 120, and Anglo-Dutch did not complain about\n\nthe take-nothing judgment on these declaratory judgment claims in its\n\nappeal to this Court or the Texas Supreme Court. 1 CR SUPP 124-183,\n\n185-214, 216-269.\n\n     Consequently, Anglo-Dutch waived its claims seeking these\n\ndeclarations. See Ontiveros v. Flores, 218 S.W.3d 70, 71 (Tex. 2007)\n\n(holding that a party waived any error as to claims by not complaining\n\non appeal about the summary judgment on those claims); Jacobs v.\n\nSatterwhite, 65 S.W.3d 653, 655-56 (Tex. 2001) (holding that a party\n\nwaived any error as to a claim by not complaining on appeal about the\n\nsummary judgment on the claim); State v.

Duke, 783 S.W.2d 209, 209-210 (Tex. 1990) (stating that it\n\nis a “well-established rule that grounds of error not asserted by points of\n\nerror or argument in the court of appeals are waived).\n\n\n\n\n                                    24\n\f              Anglo-Dutch’s waiver of all complaints about the take-nothing\n\njudgment on its numerator and rounding declarations prohibited the\n\ntrial court from reversing on remand its prior take-nothing judgment on\n\nthose requested declarations.18 See Medical Ctr.

The Trial Court Misconstrued The Fee Agreement By\n           Rewriting Its Plain Language In Violation Of The Supreme\n           Court’s Opinion.\n\n     Even if not waived, the trial court’s numerator and rounding\n\ndeclarations, and its order that Anglo-Dutch pay $306,000 instead of\n\n\n\n                                      26\n\f$1,530,000, are erroneous because the trial court misconstrued the Fee\n\nAgreement by rewriting its plain language in violation of the Supreme\n\nCourt’s opinion.     In Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v. Greenberg\n\nPeden, P.C., 352 S.W.3d 445, 452-53 (Tex. 2011), the Supreme Court did\n\nnot directly address how much Anglo-Dutch owes under the Fee\n\nAgreement largely because Anglo-Dutch did not appeal the take-\n\nnothing judgment on its numerator and rounding declarations.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court discussed interpretive principles which,\n\nwhen applied, compel rejection of the trial court’s rulings that:   the\n\nnumerator in the fee formula is Greenberg Peden’s hours; the rounding\n\nup to the next whole percentage occurs before the hours ratio is\n\nmultiplied by 20%; and Anglo-Dutch owes Swonke $306,000 instead of\n\n$1,530,000 under the Fee Agreement.\n\n          1.       The Supreme Court’s Opinion Requires Enforcement\n                   Of The Unambiguous Fee Agreement As Written.\n\n     The Texas Supreme Court concluded that the Fee Agreement was\n\nunambiguous.

The Plain Language Of The Fee Agreement\n                          Makes Swonke’s Hours The Numerator In The\n                          Fee Formula.\n\n           As written, the unambiguous Fee Agreement twice states that the\n\nnumerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula is Swonke’s hours,\n\nwithout any location-dependent limitation or restriction on those hours:\n\n              “[T]he proportions under which my fees shall be calculated\n               will be the ratio of the hours I have spent or will spend on\n               this matter relative to the hours the attorneys at McConn &\n               Williams have spent or will spend after the date the lawsuit\n               was filed. . . .” (emphasis added);\n\n              For example, if McConn & Williams' attorneys spend 1,000\n               hours on the lawsuit after the date the lawsuit was filed and\n               I spend 90 hours of my time towards the lawsuit, then by\n               rounding up to the nearest whole number, I would be\n               entitled to receive from you 2% (10% of 20%) of the gross\n               revenues and other benefits recovered, if any, from this\n               lawsuit.\n\n1 CR 312.\n\n           The Supreme Court confirmed this plain language interpretation\n\nof the Fee Agreement by expressly recognizing that the numerator in\n\nthe hours ratio is Swonke’s hours:\n\n           Since the fee was contingent on recovery and therefore not\n           based on any attorney’s hourly rate, it would presumably\n\n\n                                       28\n\f     make no difference to Anglo-Dutch who besides Swonke\n     worked on the case as long as the fee was computed on his\n     hours. . . . Nor does the fee calculation, based solely on the\n     hours Swonke spent individually, suggest that others at\n     Greenberg Peden were excluded from the work. Taking\n     Swonke’s time into account provided a way of limiting the\n     fee.\n\nAnglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 452 (emphasis added).\n\n     For these reasons, the numerator in the hours ratio is the 1,299\n\nhours Swonke worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit. See id.; David J.\n\nSacks, P.C. v. Haden, 266 S.W.3d 447, 450-51 (Tex. 2008) (enforcing the\n\nplain language of an unambiguous attorneys’ fee agreement and\n\nrefusing to impose a limitation on fees not expressed in the agreement).\n\n                b.    The Plain Language Of The Fee Agreement\n                      Requires Rounding Up To The Next Whole\n                      Percentage After The Hours Ratio Is Multiplied\n                      By 20%.\n\n     As written, the unambiguous Fee Agreement also states that the\n\nfee is a proportion of 20%, rounded up to the next whole percentage:\n\n     I agree to assist Anglo–Dutch and that firm with this\n     lawsuit for proportionately the same percentage (20%) of any\n     benefit to McConn & Williams reflected in such agreement. .\n     . . Further, the proportions under which my fees shall be\n     calculated will be the ratio of the hours I have spent or will\n     spend on this matter relative to the hours the attorneys at\n     McConn & Williams have spent or will spend after the date\n     the lawsuit was filed, rounded to the next whole percentage.\n     For example, if McConn & Williams' attorneys spend 1,000\n\n\n                                   29\n\f     hours on the lawsuit after the date the lawsuit was filed and\n     I spend 90 hours of my time towards the lawsuit, then by\n     rounding up to the nearest whole number, I would be\n     entitled to receive from you 2% (10% of 20%) of the gross\n     revenues and other benefits recovered, if any, from this\n     lawsuit.\n\n1 CR 312.\n\n     For clarity, the Fee Agreement contains an example that shows\n\nwhen the rounding to the next whole percentage occurs.             In the\n\nexample, the hours ratio (90/1000) is multiplied by 20% resulting in a\n\nfee of 1.8%, which is then rounded up to 2%. Expressed algebraically,\n\nthe example is: 90/1000 x 20% = 1.8% = 2% when rounded up to the\n\nnext whole percentage. Thus, the plain language of the Fee Agreement\n\nshows that the rounding up to the next whole percentage that is\n\nrequired occurs after, not before, the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%.\n\n            2.   The Supreme Court’s Opinion Prohibits Rewriting The\n                 Fee Agreement Or Adding To Its Language.\n\n     The corollary to the Texas Supreme Court’s mandate that\n\nunambiguous fee agreements be enforced as written is its prohibition on\n\ncourts rewriting or adding language to unambiguous contracts.

The Trial Court Rewrote The Hours Ratio In The\n                       Fee Formula At Anglo-Dutch’s Request.\n\n     Incredibly, notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s prohibition on\n\nrewriting or adding language to the unambiguous Fee Agreement,\n\nAnglo-Dutch expressly invited the trial court to “re-write” the Fee\n\nAgreement:\n\n     Since the Supreme Court of Texas ruled that the Fee\n     Agreement was with GP and not Swonke, it is clearer, for\n     analytical purposes, to re-write the Fee Agreement and\n     replace the pronouns with the term GP . . . .”\n\n1 CR 415 (emphasis added). Specifically, Anglo-Dutch asked the trial\n\ncourt to re-write the key phrase regarding the numerator in the hours\n\nratio from “the ratio of the hours I have spent or will spend on this\n\nmatter” to “the ratio of the hours GP has spent or will spend on this\n\nmatter”:\n\n     Further, the proportions under which GP’s fees shall be\n     calculated will be the ratio of the hours GP has spent or will\n     spend on this matter relative to the hours the attorneys at\n     McConn & Williams have spent or will spend after the date\n     the lawsuit was filed, rounded to the next whole percentage.\n\n\n\n\n                                    31\n\fId. at 416 (emphasis added); accord id. (“One need simply determine\n\nthe hours GP spent on the matter and divide them by the hours that\n\nMW spent on the matter . . . .”) (emphasis added).\n\n     The trial court accepted Anglo-Dutch’s invitation and held that\n\n“the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula in the Fee\n\nAgreement is the hours Greenberg Peden worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit,” 1 CR 1303 ¶¶ 2-4, or, in another instance, simply inserted\n\n“Greenberg Peden Hours” into the hours ratio in the fee formula. 1 CR\n\n524-525. But the Fee Agreement does not state, as the trial court held,\n\nthat the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula is “Greenberg\n\nPeden’s hours” or only the hours Swonke worked “while at Greenberg\n\nPeden.”\n\n     Without any support in the language of the Fee Agreement, the\n\ntrial court rewrote the fee formula by:     (1) substituting “Greenberg\n\nPeden” in two places for “I” in the Fee Agreement; and/or (2) adding\n\n“while at Greenberg Peden” to restrict Swonke’s hours in the numerator\n\nof the fee formula to those hours he worked while at Greenberg Peden.\n\nIn doing so, the trial court erred by enforcing an agreement the parties\n\ndid not make.     See David J. Sacks, P.C., 266 S.W.3d at 450-51\n\n\n\n                                   32\n\f(enforcing the plain language of an unambiguous attorneys’ fee\n\nagreement and refusing to impose a limitation on fees not expressed in\n\nthe agreement); American Mfrs.

The Trial      Court    Rewrote   The    Rounding\n                      Provision.\n\n     Similarly, the trial court rewrote the rounding provision of the Fee\n\nAgreement. The trial court declared that “the rounding up to the next\n\nwhole percentage that is required by the Fee Agreement occurs after\n\nthe hours ratio is determined [and] before, not after, the hours ratio is\n\nmultiplied by 20%.” 1 CR 1303 ¶ 4. The trial court expressed its view\n\nof the rounding provision algebraically as follows:\n\n     Greenberg Peden Hours/McConn Williams Hours = X\n     (rounded up to the next whole percentage) (X1). X1 x 20% =\n     X2.\n\n     ***\n     277 Hours/11,652 Hours = 2.37% (rounded to 3%). 3% x 20%\n     = .006%. .006 x $51,000,000.00 = $306,000.00\n\n1 CR 525.\n\n\n\n\n                                    33\n\f              However, this rewritten rounding provision does not comport with\n\nthe Fee Agreement’s plain language. This is readily apparent because,\n\nutilizing the figures in the Fee Agreement’s rounding example and\n\napplying the trial court’s holding that any rounding to the next whole\n\npercentage occurs before the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%, the fee\n\nowed is 1.8%, not the 2% set forth in the example.19 Since the fee owed\n\nafter applying the trial court’s holding to the figures in the example\n\n(1.8%) does not match the fee owed in the example (2%), the trial court’s\n\nholding cannot be correct.\n\n              On the other hand, utilizing the figures in the example and\n\napplying Swonke’s interpretation that rounding to the next whole\n\npercentage occurs after the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%, the fee\n\nowed is 2%, precisely that fee set forth in the example.20 Consequently,\n\nSwonke’s interpretation is correct and is necessarily the agreement that\n\nSwonke and Anglo-Dutch made in the Fee Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n1990/1,000 = .09 = 9%. Because 9% is a whole percentage, no rounding up occurs.\n9% x 20% = 1.8%.\n\n20 90/1,000 = .09.                              .09 x 20% = 1.8% = 2% when rounded to the next whole\npercentage.\n\n                                                                34\n\f                             3.

The Supreme Court applied\n\nthis standard first to the text of the Fee Agreement and then to the\n\nsurrounding circumstances.

The Text Of The Fee Agreement Plainly\n                                                               States That The Numerator Of The Hours\n                                                               Ratio Is Swonke’s Hours.\n\n              As previously noted, the text of the Fee Agreement, which Anglo-\n\nDutch proposed,21 twice refers to the numerator in the hours ratio as\n\nSwonke’s                      hours,                 without      any    location-dependent   limitation   or\n\n                                                            \n21See Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 452 (“Van Dyke was not an\nunsophisticated client; indeed, it was he, not Swonke, who proposed the terms of the\nFee Agreement.”).\n\n\n\n                                                                        35\n\frestriction on those hours.    And, as previously noted, the Supreme\n\nCourt has already construed this language to mean that the fee\n\ncalculation was based solely on Swonke’s individual hours because it\n\nprovided a way of limiting Anglo-Dutch’s fee.         See Anglo-Dutch\n\nPetroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 452 (emphasis added).           Thus, a\n\nreasonable   person   in    Anglo-Dutch’s   circumstances   would    have\n\nrecognized from the text of the Fee Agreement that the numerator of\n\nthe hours ratio is Swonke’s hours.\n\n                      ii.   The     Circumstances     Surrounding The\n                            Execution Of The Fee Agreement Do Not\n                            Alter Its Plain Language.\n\n     In the words of the Texas Supreme Court, “the circumstances in\n\nwhich the Fee Agreement was executed do not suggest that the parties\n\nmust have intended something different from what they plainly stated.”\n\nId. at 453. The Fee Agreement resulted from Anglo-Dutch’s desire to\n\nhave Swonke’s—not Greenberg Peden’s—assistance in the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit:\n\n     But Swonke’s continued counsel, based on his involvement in\n     the events leading up to the litigation, was still needed and\n     Van Dyke asked him to assist McConn & Williams, again for\n     a contingent fee.\n\n\n\n\n                                     36\n\fAnglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 447. And Greenberg Peden,\n\nto whom Swonke had presented the potential representation in\n\ncompliance with his of counsel arrangement, had declined to represent\n\nAnglo-Dutch in the Halliburton Lawsuit because Anglo-Dutch had not\n\npaid its outstanding bills to Greenberg Peden. Id.\n\n     Under these circumstances, when Anglo-Dutch sought Swonke’s\n\nhelp and Greenberg Peden had refused to represent Anglo-Dutch in the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit, it would be utterly illogical to construe the\n\npersonal pronouns defining the hours ratio as referring to anyone other\n\nthan Swonke. The circumstances surrounding the execution of the Fee\n\nAgreement certainly “do not suggest that the parties must have\n\nintended something different from what they plainly stated.” Id. at 453.\n\n                      iii. The Post-Fee Agreement Circumstances Do\n                           Not Alter The Plain Language Of The Fee\n                           Agreement.\n\n     Again in the words of the Supreme Court, “[e]vents following the\n\nFee Agreement do not cast the situation in a different light.” Id. at 453.\n\nWhen Swonke relocated from Greenberg Peden to McConn & Williams,\n\nSwonke informed Anglo-Dutch that Greenberg Peden was going to\n\ndissolve and that, absent objection (which was never made), he would\n\n\n\n                                   37\n\fcontinue    to   represent   Anglo-Dutch   in   matters,   including   the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit, in his new position as of counsel to McConn &\n\nWilliams:\n\n     But a year later, Greenberg Peden dissolved, and Swonke\n     moved to McConn & Williams, again in an “of counsel”\n     relationship. In a letter to Van Dyke, Swonke wrote that he\n     would not take the Anglo-Dutch files with him if Van Dyke\n     objected. Van Dyke did not.\n\nAnglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 448-49; 1 CR 193-194, 354.\n\n     At this point in time, Anglo-Dutch could have limited the fees\n\nowed under the Fee Agreement to the hours Swonke spent on the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to Greenberg Peden, as it now\n\nattempts to do, by requiring that the file stay at Greenberg Peden and\n\nnot allowing Swonke to take it with him to his of counsel position at\n\nMcConn & Williams. But Anglo-Dutch chose to continue working with\n\nSwonke because it needed his help. Because Anglo-Dutch’s decision to\n\npermit Swonke to take the Halliburton Lawsuit file with him to his of\n\ncounsel position at McConn & Williams without objection created the\n\nsituation about which it now complains, Anglo-Dutch’s complaint about\n\ncompensating Swonke for the time he worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit while there must fall on deaf ears.\n\n\n\n                                   38\n\f     With Anglo-Dutch’s knowledge, Swonke worked 1,022 hours on\n\nthe Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel at McConn & Williams. See 1\n\nCR 206. Included in those hours was time Swonke spent attending Van\n\nDyke’s three-day deposition, which occurred six months after Swonke\n\nrelocated from Greenberg Peden to McConn & Williams. 1 CR 206. In\n\nhis deposition, Van Dyke testified in the present tense that he had a fee\n\nagreement with Swonke, and noted through his testimony that his fee\n\nagreement with Swonke was separate and distinct from his other\n\nattorneys’ fee agreements:\n\n     Q:         The attorney’s fees, the written contract that you\n                made reference to a moment ago?\n\n     Van Dyke: Yes.\n\n     ***\n\n     Q:         Who is it with?\n\n     Van Dyke: It is with – there’s actually – there are two\n               contracts in existence, one is with a contract with\n               Mr. O’Quinn, Mr. McConn and Mr. Williams, and\n               the second contract is with Mr. Swonke.\n\n1 CR 247.\n\n     Finally, Swonke received no fees from McConn & Williams or any\n\nother source for any of the hours he spent on the Halliburton Lawsuit,\n\n\n\n                                   39\n\fincluding the 1,022 hours that he spent on the Halliburton Lawsuit\n\nafter relocating from Greenberg Peden to McConn & Williams. 1 CR\n\n206.\n\n       The post-Fee Agreement circumstances reflect that Swonke\n\nworked on the Halliburton Lawsuit for more than one thousand hours\n\nafter relocating from Greenberg Peden to McConn & Williams with the\n\nexpectation to be paid under the Fee Agreement by Anglo-Dutch, which\n\nknew both that Swonke was actively working on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit and that the Fee Agreement, the numerator in which is based\n\non Swonke’s unrestricted and unlimited hours, was still in full force and\n\neffect. These post-Fee Agreement circumstances only bolster Swonke\n\nand the Supreme Court’s interpretation that the numerator in the\n\nhours ratio is Swonke’s hours. See Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352\n\nS.W.3d at 452; David J. Sacks, P.C., 266 S.W.3d at 450-51 (enforcing\n\nthe plain language of an unambiguous attorneys’ fee agreement and\n\nrefusing to impose a limitation on fees not expressed in the agreement).\n\n       Based on its text and the surrounding circumstances, a reasonable\n\nperson in Anglo-Dutch’s circumstances would have recognized that the\n\nnumerator in the hours ratio is Swonke’s hours.\n\n\n\n                                   40\n\f                b.

And, as previously stated, Anglo-Dutch’s method of\n\nrounding does not comport with the Fee Agreement’s plain language\n\nbecause Anglo-Dutch’s method produces an answer different than that\n\nin the Fee Agreement’s example.        Anglo-Dutch’s rounding method\n\nproduces an answer of 1.8% for the example while the Fee Agreement\n\nplainly shows that proper rounding results in an answer of 2% for the\n\nexample. Thus, a reasonable person in Anglo-Dutch’s circumstances\n\nwould have recognized from the text of the Fee Agreement that the\n\nrounding up to the next whole percentage occurs after, not before,\n\nmultiplying the hours ratio by 20%.\n\n\n\n\n                                  41\n\f                        ii.   Neither The Circumstances Surrounding The\n                              Execution Of The Fee Agreement Nor Post-\n                              Fee Agreement Circumstances Alter Its Plain\n                              Language That Requires Rounding After\n                              Multiplying The Hours Ratio By 20%.\n\n     Swonke and Van Dyke discussed the rounding feature before the\n\nFee Agreement was signed and it was clear that Van Dyke understood\n\nthe rounding feature as Swonke did. 9 RR 247-48. Van Dyke never\n\nsuggested during this discussion that the rounding would occur before\n\nthe hours ratio was multiplied by 20%. 9 RR 249. Anglo-Dutch first\n\nasserted that the rounding should occur before the hours ratio was\n\nmultiplied by 20% once the lawsuit was filed. Id. Consequently, “the\n\ncircumstances in which the Fee Agreement was executed do not suggest\n\nthat the parties must have intended something different from what\n\nthey plainly stated” regarding when rounding occurs. See Anglo-Dutch\n\nPetroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 453.\n\n     C.    Conclusion\n\n     As explained above, the trial court erred by rendering judgment\n\non Anglo-Dutch’s requested numerator and rounding declarations\n\nbecause Anglo-Dutch waived any entitlement to the declarations and, in\n\nany event, the declarations misconstrue the Fee Agreement by\n\n\n\n                                      42\n\frewriting its plain language in violation of the Supreme Court’s opinion.\n\nThese mistakes resulted in the rendition of an incorrect judgment for\n\nSwonke of $306,000 based on the parties’ stipulated facts.\n\n        Applying the trial court’s erroneous rounding declaration, but\n\nchanging its numerator declaration to include in the numerator all of\n\nthe hours Swonke worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit without\n\nlimitation or restriction, results in a fee owed under the Fee Agreement\n\nof $1,224,000, calculated as follows:\n\n    (1,299/11,652) = .11148301 = 11.148301% = 12% rounded up to the next\n                              whole percentage\n\n                              12% x 20% = 2.4%\n\n                       2.4% x $51,000,000 = $1,224,000\n\n        Applying the trial court’s numerator declaration, but changing its\n\nrounding declaration by rounding up to the next whole percentage after\n\nthe hours ratio is multiplied by 20%, results in a fee owed of $510,000,\n\ncalculated as follows:\n\n      (277/11,652) x 20% = .475455% = 1% when rounded up to the next\n                              whole percentage\n\n                         1% x $51,000,000 = $510,000\n\n\n\n\n                                     43\n\f        Changing both the trial court’s erroneous numerator and rounding\n\ndeclarations by including all of Swonke’s hours in the numerator and\n\nrounding to the next whole percentage after the hours ratio is\n\nmultiplied by 20%, results in a fee owed of $1,530,000, calculated as\n\nfollows:\n\n                         1,299/11,652 = .11148301\n\n    .11148301 x 20% = 2.22966% = 3% when rounded up to the next whole\n                               percentage\n\n                      3% x $51,000,000 = $1,530,000\n\n        Based on the parties’ stipulated facts, the amount owed under the\n\nFee Agreement when properly construed is $1,530,000. The trial court\n\nerred by refusing to render judgment for Swonke in that amount.\n\nII.     The Trial Court Erred By Rendering Judgment Against—And\n        Refusing To Render Judgment For—Swonke On His Attorneys’\n        Fees Claims.\n\n        The trial court’s 2007 Judgment ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay to\n\nSwonke attorneys’ fees of $352,892.50 for representation in the trial\n\ncourt and $75,000 for representation in the court of appeals. See 1 CR\n\nsupp 121. The trial court found those attorneys’ fees to be reasonable,\n\nnecessary, equitable, and just for the prosecution of Swonke’s breach of\n\n\n\n\n                                    44\n\fcontract and declaratory judgment claims, and Swonke’s defense of\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s declaratory judgment claims. Id.\n\n     As Anglo-Dutch has previously conceded, Anglo-Dutch did not\n\nappeal Swonke’s attorneys’ fees award: “Anglo-Dutch did not raise a\n\nseparate and distinct appeal point concerning the award of attorneys’\n\nfees to Swonke.” See 1 CR SUPP 394; Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc.\n\nv. Greenberg Peden, P.C., 267 S.W.3d 454, 464 n.5 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2008) (“Anglo–Dutch does not challenge on appeal . . . the\n\nseparate statutory fee award for litigating Swonke's contract claim\n\nunder the disputed fee agreement, which the parties opted to try to the\n\ncourt.”), rev’d, 352 S.W.3d 445 (Tex. 2011); 2 CR SUPP 766-815; 3 CR\n\nSUPP 817-846, 848-901.\n\n     On remand, Swonke and Anglo-Dutch cross-moved for summary\n\njudgment on Swonke’s attorneys’ fees claims. 1 CR SUPP 77; 1 CR 271.\n\nThe trial court ruled for Anglo-Dutch and interlocutorily ordered that\n\nSwonke take nothing on his attorney fees’ claims. See 1 CR 668-669.\n\nBased on that order, the trial court ultimately rendered a take-nothing\n\njudgment against Swonke on his attorneys’ fees claims. See 1 CR 1304.\n\n\n\n\n                                  45\n\f     A.    The Trial Court Erred By Granting Summary Judgment\n           Against Swonke On His Attorneys’ Fees Claims.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch sought summary judgment on Swonke’s claim for\n\nattorneys’ fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code chapter\n\n38 on the sole ground that Swonke did not prevail on his breach of\n\ncontract claim.   See 1 CR SUPP 281-282. Anglo-Dutch argued that\n\nSwonke did not prevail on his breach of contract claim because the\n\nTexas Supreme Court ruled that the Fee Agreement was between\n\nAnglo-Dutch and Greenberg Peden, not Swonke. See 1 CR SUPP 282.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch sought summary judgment on Swonke’s claim for\n\nattorneys’ fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section\n\n37.009 on three grounds: (1) Swonke’s declaratory judgment claim\n\nraised only issues already raised by Anglo-Dutch’s original claim; (2)\n\nSwonke did not prevail on his breach of contract claim; and (3) it would\n\nnot be equitable or just to award attorneys’ fees to Swonke. See 1 CR\n\nSUPP 282-284.\n\n     As shown below, none of Anglo-Dutch’s arguments support the\n\ntrial court’s summary judgment against Swonke on his attorneys’ fees\n\nclaims because: (1) Anglo-Dutch waived all complaints about Swonke’s\n\nattorneys’ fees award; (2) notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s opinion,\n\n\n                                  46\n\fSwonke had standing and capacity to sue for breach of the Fee\n\nAgreement; (3) Swonke may recover Declaratory Judgment Act\n\nattorneys’ fees defending against against declaratory judgment claims;\n\nand (4) Swonke’s award of attorneys’ fees was equitable and just and\n\nAnglo-Dutch waived any complaint that it was not.\n\n          1.    Anglo-Dutch’s Waiver Of All Complaints About The\n                2007 Judgment’s Award Of Attorneys’ Fees To Swonke\n                Prohibited The Trial Court From Altering The Award\n                On Remand.\n\n     As previously noted, Anglo-Dutch did not complain on appeal\n\nabout the 2007 Judgment’s award of attorneys’ fees to Swonke. See 1\n\nCR SUPP 394 (“Anglo-Dutch did not raise a separate and distinct\n\nappeal point concerning the award of attorneys’ fees to Swonke.”);\n\nAnglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v. Greenberg Peden, P.C., 267 S.W.3d\n\n454, 464 n.5 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008); 2 CR SUPP 756-\n\n815; 3 CR SUPP 817-846; 3 CR SUPP 848-901.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch’s failure to complain on appeal about the 2007\n\nJudgment’s award of attorneys’ fees to Swonke waived all complaints\n\nabout that award.      See Hudspeth County Underground Water\n\nConservation Dist. No. 1 v. Guitar Holding Co., L.P., 355 S.W.3d 428\n\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, pet. denied) (holding that a party waived its\n\n\n                                  47\n\fcomplaint about the court of appeals’ decisions regarding entitlement to\n\nattorneys’ fees and prevailing-party status by not appealing those\n\nissues to the Texas Supreme Court); City of Temple v. Taylor, 268\n\nS.W.3d 852, 858 (Tex.

The complaints\n\nwaived by Anglo-Dutch include all of the grounds that Anglo-Dutch\n\nasserted in its motion for summary judgment on Swonke’s attorneys’\n\nfees claims.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch’s waiver of all complaints about the 2007 Judgment’s\n\naward of attorneys’ fees to Swonke prohibited the trial court from\n\naltering the attorneys’ fees award on remand because a trial court errs\n\nby rendering a judgment on remand that alters its own or a higher\n\ncourt’s prior judgment on an issue that was not appealed. See Medical\n\nCtr. Pharmacy, 634 F.3d at 834 (holding that the district court erred by\n\nreversing on remand its prior ruling granting declaratory relief which\n\nhad been waived on appeal); United Resources, L.P., 2014 WL 3339537,\n\n\n\n                                   48\n\fat *3 (holding that the trial court erred on remand by modifying its\n\nprior take-nothing judgment on cross-claims because no party had\n\nattacked that part of the trial court’s judgment in an earlier appeal);\n\nHudspeth County Underground Water Conservation Dist.

Thomasville Furniture Indus., Inc., 550 F.3d 529, 533 (6th Cir.\n\n2008) (holding that a district court erred on remand by rendering\n\njudgment on a jury’s $3.3 million lost profits finding because the district\n\ncourt’s previously-rendered judgment on a $0 lost profits finding had\n\nbeen waived on appeal); Anderson Courier Serv., 222 S.W.3d at 66-67\n\n(holding that the trial court erred by awarding attorneys’ fees under the\n\ndeclaratory judgment act on remand when any complaint that the trial\n\ncourt’s original judgment failed to award attorneys’ fees was waived on\n\nappeal).\n\n     Because Anglo-Dutch waived any complaint about Swonke’s\n\nattorneys’ fees award in the 2007 Judgment by not appealing that\n\n\n\n                                    49\n\faward, and Anglo-Dutch’s waiver prohibited the trial court from\n\naltering the award on remand, the trial court erred by granting a take-\n\nnothing summary judgment to Anglo-Dutch on Swonke’s attorneys’ fees\n\nclaims.\n\n            2.   Alternatively, Even If Not Waived, Anglo-Dutch’s\n                 Grounds For Summary Judgment On Swonke’s\n                 Attorneys’ Fees Claims Lack Merit.\n\n     Alternatively, even if not waived, Anglo-Dutch’s grounds for\n\nsummary judgment on Swonke’s attorney’s fees claims lack merit\n\nbecause, as shown below, Anglo-Dutch did not conclusively negate any\n\nelement of Swonke’s attorneys’ fees claims and genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact remain on those claims.\n\n                 a.   Notwithstanding The Supreme Court’s Opinion,\n                      Swonke Had Standing And Capacity To Sue For\n                      Breach Of The Fee Agreement.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch argued that Swonke was not entitled to attorneys’\n\nfees under chapter 38 on the sole ground that Swonke had not prevailed\n\non his breach of contract claim since the Texas Supreme Court ruled\n\nthat the Fee Agreement was between Anglo-Dutch and Greenberg\n\nPeden, not Swonke.     See 1 CR SUPP 282.       Two flaws infect this\n\nargument.\n\n\n\n                                  50\n\f     First, the Texas Supreme Court’s holding that Swonke was not a\n\nparty to the Fee Agreement was not dispositive of Swonke’s breach of\n\ncontract claim because Swonke need not have been a party to the Fee\n\nAgreement to sue for its breach; assignees and third-party beneficiaries\n\nalso have standing and capacity to sue for breach of contract.        See\n\nSouthwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Marketing on Hold, Inc., 308\n\nS.W.3d 909, 916 (Tex. 2010) (“Because [assignee] holds contractually\n\nvalid assignments, [assignee] steps into the shoes of the claimholders\n\nand is considered under the law to have suffered the same injury as the\n\nassignors and have the same ability to pursue the claims.”); Brown v.\n\nMesa Distributors, Inc., 414 S.W.3d 279, 281-82 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (“In order to establish standing to maintain a\n\nbreach of contract action, a plaintiff must show either third-party-\n\nbeneficiary status or privity. Privity is established by proof that the\n\ndefendant was a party to an enforceable contract with either the\n\nplaintiff or a party who assigned its cause of action to the plaintiff.”);\n\nPagosa Oil and Gas, L.L.C. v. Marrs and Smith Partnership, 323\n\nS.W.3d 203, 210 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2010, pet. denied) (parties,\n\n\n\n\n                                   51\n\fassignees, and third-party beneficiaries have standing to sue for breach\n\nof contract).\n\n      Anglo-Dutch did not argue—much less conclusively prove—that\n\nSwonke lacked standing or capacity to sue for breach of the Fee\n\nAgreement, or that Swonke was not an assignee or third-party\n\nbeneficiary of the Fee Agreement. Consequently, Anglo-Dutch was not\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Swonke’s breach of contract claim.\n\n      Second, the summary judgment evidence affirmatively showed\n\nthat Swonke had capacity and standing to sue for breach of the Fee\n\nAgreement as an assignee and a third-party beneficiary of the Fee\n\nAgreement.      On April 16, 2004, before this lawsuit was ever filed,\n\nGreenberg Peden assigned all of its interest in and under the Fee\n\nAgreement to Swonke. See 2 CR SUPP 723. Indeed, on remand, the\n\ntrial court recognized the validity of that assignment in its May 15,\n\n2012 Order: “[U]nder the Fee Agreement the Court determines that the\n\nattorneys’ fees due to Greenberg Peden (and now Swonke by way of\n\nassignment) are $306,000.” 2 CR SUPP 734. That assignment also\n\nidentifies Swonke as the “third party beneficiary” of the Fee Agreement.\n\nSee id. At a minimum, the assignment and designation of Swonke as a\n\n\n\n                                   52\n\fthird-party beneficiary raised genuine issues of material fact that\n\nprecluded summary judgment for Anglo-Dutch on Swonke’s breach of\n\ncontract claim. See Brown, 414 S.W.3d at 285-86 (holding that legally\n\nsufficient evidence supported the standing of an assignee to sue for\n\nbreach of contract when the contract that was assigned and the\n\nassignment were introduced into evidence).\n\n                b.    Anglo-Dutch’s Grounds For Summary Judgment\n                      On Swonke’s Claim For Attorneys’ Fees Under\n                      The Declaratory Judgment Act Lack Merit.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch argued that Swonke was not entitled to attorneys’\n\nfees under section 37.009 of the Declaratory Judgment Act for three\n\nreasons: (1) Swonke’s declaratory judgment claim only raised issues\n\nalready raised by Anglo-Dutch’s original claim; (2) Swonke’s breach of\n\ncontract claim failed; and (3) it would not be equitable or just to award\n\nattorneys’ fees to Swonke. 1 CR SUPP 282-284.\n\n                      i.   Swonke May Recover Attorneys’ Fees Under\n                           The Declaratory Judgment Act Because He\n                           Defended Against Anglo-Dutch’s Declaratory\n                           Judgment Action.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch argued that Swonke was not entitled to attorneys’\n\nfees under the Declaratory Judgment Act because his declaratory\n\njudgment claim only raised issues already raised by Anglo-Dutch’s\n\n\n                                   53\n\foriginal claim.    See 1 CR SUPP 282.            Anglo-Dutch relied on\n\nMontemayor v. Ortiz, 208 S.W.3d 627, 666 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n2006, pet. denied), but Montemayor itself defeats Anglo-Dutch’s\n\nargument. In Montemayor, the court of appeals held that the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion by awarding attorneys’ fees to a defendant\n\nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act because the plaintiff’s original\n\nclaim was for a declaratory judgment. See Montemayor, 208 S.W.3d at\n\n666-67. Indeed, Montemayor expressly states that the rule upon which\n\nAnglo-Dutch relied “does not apply where a defendant is defending\n\nagainst a plaintiff's declaratory judgment action.” Id.\n\n     Here, Anglo-Dutch originally brought declaratory judgment claims\n\nand Swonke defended against them. See 1 CR SUPP 300; 1 CR SUPP\n\n392 (“Anglo-Dutch filed suit against Greenberg Peden, P.C. . . . and\n\nSwonke, seeking relief pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Act . . . .”).\n\nConsequently, Swonke was entitled to recover attorneys’ fees under the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act. See Montemayor, 208 S.W.3d at 666-67.\n\n                      ii.   Swonke’s Breach Of Contract Claim Did Not\n                            Fail.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch also argued that Swonke could not recover attorneys’\n\nfees under the Declaratory Judgment Act because Swonke’s breach of\n\n\n                                    54\n\fcontract claim purportedly failed due to the Texas Supreme Court’s\n\nholding that Swonke was not a party to the Fee Agreement. See 1 CR\n\nSUPP 283. However, for the reasons set forth in section II.A.2.a. above,\n\nwhich are incorporated herein by reference, Anglo-Dutch’s argument\n\nthat Swonke did not prevail on his breach of contract claim lacks merit.\n\n                      iii. Anglo-Dutch Waived Its Complaint That\n                           Swonke’s Attorneys’ Fee Award Was Not\n                           Equitable And Just And, In Any Event, The\n                           Award Was Equitable And Just.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch finally argued that Swonke could not recover\n\nattorneys’ fees under the Declaratory Judgment Act because it would\n\nnot be equitable and just to award attorneys’ fees to Swonke. See 1 CR\n\nSUPP 283-284. In its 2007 Judgment, the trial court expressly found\n\nthat Swonke’s award of attorneys’ fees was equitable and just. See 1\n\nCR 299.   But Anglo-Dutch did not attack that conclusion of law on\n\nappeal. See 1 CR SUPP 394 (“Anglo-Dutch did not raise a separate and\n\ndistinct appeal point concerning the award of attorneys’ fees to\n\nSwonke.”); Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v. Greenberg Peden, P.C.,\n\n267 S.W.3d 454, 464 n.5 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008)\n\n(“Anglo–Dutch does not challenge on appeal . . . the separate statutory\n\nfee award for litigating Swonke's contract claim under the disputed fee\n\n\n                                   55\n\fagreement, which the parties opted to try to the court.”), rev’d, 352\n\nS.W.3d 445 (Tex. 2011); 1 CR SUPP 124-183, 185-214, 216-269. Thus,\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s attack on the equitable and just nature of Swonke’s\n\nattorneys’ fees award has been waived and could not have been properly\n\nrevisited on remand by the trial court.\n\n     In any event, it was equitable and just to award attorneys’ fees to\n\nSwonke under the Declaratory Judgment Act given the circumstances\n\nof this case. Swonke has thus far defeated three of Anglo-Dutch’s seven\n\ndeclaratory judgment claims and, when this Court reverses the trial\n\ncourt’s numerator and rounding declarations, Anglo-Dutch will have\n\nsucceeded on only two of seven requested declarations. And neither of\n\nthose declarations are significant to the ultimate issue in this case—\n\nwhat does Anglo-Dutch owe Swonke under the Fee Agreement? The\n\ndeclaration that Greenberg Peden is a party to the Fee Agreement is of\n\nno moment because, as explained above, it is not dispositive of Swonke’s\n\nbreach of contract claim.    The declaration that Swonke’s hours at\n\nMcConn & Williams are included in the denominator in the fee formula\n\nis insignificant and was agreed to by Swonke because it does not change\n\nthe fee owed to Swonke under the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 460.\n\n\n\n                                   56\n\f     Moreover, the facts contained in the Statement of Facts in this\n\nbrief, which are incorporated herein by reference, also demonstrate that\n\nit was equitable and just to award Swonke attorneys’ fees for his\n\ndefense of Anglo-Dutch’s declaratory judgment claims. Specifically, Van\n\nDyke’s company, Anglo-Dutch, settled the Halliburton Lawsuit for\n\n$51,000,000 and then stiffed Swonke on his fee. Anglo-Dutch then sued\n\nSwonke for a judicial declaration that it owed him nothing for the 1,022\n\nhours he had worked on the lawsuit while at McConn & Williams even\n\nthough:\n\n           Greenberg Peden had expressly refused to represent Anglo-\n            Dutch in the Halliburton Lawsuit and told Van Dyke so;\n\n           Van Dyke, not Swonke, proposed the disputed terms in the\n            Fee Agreement;\n\n           Greenberg Peden is not mentioned in the body of the Fee\n            Agreement;\n\n           The Fee Agreement uses personal pronouns twelve times in\n            nine sentences to refer to Swonke;\n\n           Van Dyke himself testified in the Halliburton Lawsuit that\n            Anglo-Dutch had a fee agreement with Swonke;\n\n           Swonke worked 1,022 hours on the Halliburton Lawsuit\n            without compensation while “of counsel” at McConn &\n            Williams because he knew he would be compensated under\n            the Fee Agreement with Anglo-Dutch;\n\n\n\n                                   57\n\f           Although Anglo-Dutch seeks to avoid paying Swonke\n            attorneys’ fees for the 1,022 hours he worked on the\n            Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams,\n            Anglo-Dutch’s verdict that resulted in the $51,000,000\n            settlement actually included attorneys’ fees for those same\n            hours;\n\n           After settling the Halliburton Lawsuit for $51,000,000,\n            Anglo-Dutch began a concerted effort to avoid its contractual\n            obligations to numerous others who helped it prevail; and\n\n           Swonke has not been compensated by anyone for any of his\n            1,299 hours of work on the Halliburton Lawsuit that helped\n            Anglo-Dutch recover $51,000,000.\n\nThese facts demonstrate that an award of attorneys’ fees to Swonke is\n\nequitable and just. See Hoover Slovacek, L.L.P. v. Walton, 206 S.W.3d\n\n557, 563 (Tex. 2006) (“[A]ttorneys are entitled to protection from clients\n\nwho would abuse the contingent fee arrangement and avoid duties owed\n\nunder contract.”).\n\n     B.     The Trial Court Erred By Refusing To Render Judgment Of\n            $427,892.50 For Swonke On His Attorneys’ Fees Claims.\n\n     As previously noted, Swonke moved for a partial summary\n\njudgment on his attorneys’ fees claims. 1 CR SUPP 77-270. The trial\n\ncourt denied that motion by ordering that Swonke take-nothing on his\n\nattorneys’ fees claims. 1 CR 668. Swonke also moved the Court to\n\nrender judgment on his attorneys’ fees claims. 3 CR SUPP 1014. The\n\n\n\n                                    58\n\ftrial court’s final judgment denied that requested relief by rendering\n\njudgment that Swonke take nothing on his attorneys’ fees claims. 3 CR\n\nSUPP 1304. As shown below, the trial court erred by refusing to render\n\njudgment for Swonke on his attorneys’ fees claims.\n\n     A lower court’s judgment remains in force and effect as to any\n\nissue it decides that is not appealed. See Guitar Holding Co., L.P. v.\n\nHudspeth County Underground Water Conservation Dist. No. 1, 263\n\nS.W.3d 910, 918 (Tex. 2008); Bramlett v. Phillips, 359 S.W.3d 304, 311\n\n(Tex. App.—Amarillo 2012), aff’d, Phillips v. Bramlett, 407 S.W.3d 229\n\n(Tex. 2013).\n\n     In Guitar Holding, the Supreme Court reversed the court of\n\nappeals’ judgment and declared certain water transfer permits and\n\nrules relating thereto invalid. See id. On motion for rehearing, the\n\nlosing party argued that it had prevailed on several other issues in the\n\ncourt of appeals which were unchallenged—and therefore waived—in\n\nthe Supreme Court. See id. The Supreme Court agreed that those\n\nissues were waived and held that “the court of appeals’ judgment\n\nremains in effect as to these abandoned issues.” Id. In Bramlett, the\n\ncourt of appeals succinctly stated the rule:\n\n\n\n                                    59\n\f      [A]s to issues not addressed by the Supreme Court, the\n      opinions and judgments of this Court [of Appeals] remain in\n      force and effect. Similarly, as to those issues not addressed\n      by either the Supreme Court or this Court [of Appeals], the\n      [original] judgment of the trial court remains in force and\n      effect.\n\nBramlett, 359 S.W.3d at 311.\n\n      Indeed, a lower court’s judgment remains controlling on issues it\n\ndecided that were waived on appeal even when that judgment is\n\n“reversed” by a higher court. See Phillips v. Bramlett, 407 S.W.3d 229,\n\n233, 237 (Tex. 2013); Guitar Holding Co., L.P., 263 S.W.3d at 918. In\n\nPhillips, the Supreme Court held that the portion of a court of appeals’\n\njudgment that reversed punitive damages was not reversed—but\n\ninstead was “approved”—in the Supreme Court, even though the\n\nSupreme Court’s opinion, judgment, and mandate stated that the court\n\nof   appeals’   judgment   was   reversed,   because   that   issue   went\n\nunchallenged in the Supreme Court and unaddressed in its opinion.\n\nSee id. at 233, 237. Similarly, in Guitar Holding, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that its reversal of the court of appeals’ judgment did not actually\n\nreverse issues decided by the court of appeals that were not appealed to\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court. Guitar Holding Co., L.P., 263 S.W.3d at 918.\n\n\n\n\n                                   60\n\f     As previously noted, Anglo-Dutch did not appeal to any court the\n\ntrial court’s award of attorneys’ fees to Swonke in the 2007 Judgment.\n\nConsequently, the 2007 Judgment’s award of attorneys’ fees remains in\n\nforce and effect. See Guitar Holding Co., 263 S.W.3d at 918; Bramlett,\n\n359 S.W.3d at 311.\n\n     In Phillips, the Texas Supreme Court concluded that, “[b]y\n\nremanding the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment consistent\n\nwith our opinion, we permitted the trial court to enter a final judgment\n\nthat reflected this [Supreme] Court’s holdings and the court of appeals’\n\nholding . . . .” Phillips, 407 S.W.3d at 237 (emphasis added). Like\n\nPhillips, by remanding this case to the trial court for entry of a\n\njudgment in accordance with its opinion, the Supreme Court in this case\n\npermitted the trial court to render a final judgment that reflected the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding—that Greenberg Peden was unambiguously a\n\nparty to the Fee Agreement—and the prior decisions of the trial court\n\nand this Court that were waived on appeal, including the trial court’s\n\naward of $427,892.50 to Swonke on his attorneys’ fee claims. See id.\n\nThe trial court’s refusal to render such a judgment for Swonke on his\n\nattorneys’ fees claims was error.\n\n\n\n                                    61\n\fIII.   The Trial Court Erred By Rendering Judgment Against—And\n       Refusing To Render Judgment For—Swonke On His Breach Of\n       Contract Claim.\n\n       A.   The Trial Court Erred By Granting Summary Judgment To\n            Anglo-Dutch On Swonke’s Breach Of Contract Claim.\n\n       On remand, Anglo-Dutch sought summary judgment on Swonke’s\n\nbreach of contract claim on the sole ground that the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt had ruled that Swonke did not have a contract with Anglo-Dutch.\n\nSee 1 CR SUPP 280-281. The trial court granted Anglo-Dutch’s motion\n\nand ordered that Swonke take nothing on his breach of contract claim.\n\n1 CR 668.\n\n       However, for the reasons stated in detail in section II.A.2.a. above,\n\nwhich are incorporated herein by reference, Anglo-Dutch was not\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Swonke’s breach of contract claim\n\nbecause: Anglo-Dutch did not conclusively negate Swonke’s standing or\n\ncapacity to sue for breach of the Fee Agreement as an assignee or third-\n\nparty beneficiary; and the April 16, 2004 assignment from Greenberg\n\nPeden to Swonke of Greenberg Peden’s interest in the Fee Agreement\n\nraised a genuine issue of material fact about whether Swonke had\n\nstanding and capacity to sue for breach of the Fee Agreement as an\n\nassignee or third-party beneficiary. For those reasons, the trial court\n\n\n                                     62\n\ferred by granting summary judgment to Anglo-Dutch on Swonke’s\n\nbreach of contract claim.\n\n     B.    Alternatively, The Trial Court Erred By Refusing To Render\n           Judgment For Swonke On His Breach Of Contract Claim.\n\n     As explained above, the trial court erred by misconstruing the Fee\n\nAgreement and refusing to render judgment that Anglo-Dutch owes\n\nSwonke $1,530,000 under the Fee Agreement. In the alternative to that\n\nrecovery, the trial court erred by refusing to render judgment for\n\nSwonke on his breach of contract claim.\n\n     Swonke moved the trial court to render judgment for him on his\n\nbreach of contract claim. 3 CR SUPP 1014. The trial court denied\n\nSwonke’s request and rendered a take-nothing judgment against\n\nSwonke on his breach of contract claim. 1 CR 1304. As shown below,\n\nthe trial court erred by refusing to render judgment for Swonke on his\n\nbreach of contract claim because conclusive evidence and undisturbed\n\njury findings from the original trial entitle Swonke to the rendition of a\n\njudgment for $1,000,000 on his breach of contract claim.\n\n     Swonke sued Anglo-Dutch for breach of the Fee Agreement. 1 CR\n\nSUPP 294-307. The elements of a breach of contract claim are: “(1) the\n\nexistence of a valid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance\n\n\n                                   63\n\fby the plaintiff; (3) breach of contract by the defendant; and (4)\n\ndamages sustained as a result of the breach.” Sims v. Fitzpatrick, No.\n\n01-13-00176-CV, 2014 WL 1004410, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st.\n\nDist.] March 13, 2014, pet. denied).\n\n     The first element of Swonke’s breach of contract claim—the\n\nexistence of a contract—is undisputed and was conclusively proved in\n\nthe original trial. The Fee Agreement is the contract. 1 CR 312-313;\n\nAnglo Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v. Greenberg Peden, P.C., 352 S.W.3d\n\n445, 453 (Tex. 2011) (“We hold that the agreement was between Anglo-\n\nDutch and Greenberg Peden.”).\n\n     Moreover, the evidence conclusively proved that Swonke had\n\nstanding and capacity to sue for breach of the Fee Agreement as an\n\nassignee and a third-party beneficiary of the Fee Agreement.       See\n\nSouthwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Marketing on Hold, Inc., 308\n\nS.W.3d 909, 916 (Tex. 2010) (“Because [assignee] holds contractually\n\nvalid assignments, [assignee] steps into the shoes of the claimholders\n\nand is considered under the law to have suffered the same injury as the\n\nassignors and have the same ability to pursue the claims.”). On April\n\n16, 2004, before this lawsuit was ever filed, Greenberg Peden assigned\n\n\n\n                                   64\n\fall of its interest in and under the Fee Agreement to Swonke. See 1 CR\n\n385 (“Greenberg Peden, P.C. hereby . . . ASSIGNS all of its interest in\n\nand under the [Fee Agreement] to Swonke.”); [additional cite]. Indeed,\n\nthe trial court recognized the validity of that assignment as a matter of\n\nlaw in its May 15, 2012 Order: “[U]nder the Fee Agreement the Court\n\ndetermines that the attorneys’ fees due to Greenberg Peden (and now\n\nSwonke by way of assignment) are $306,000.” (emphasis added). That\n\nassignment also identifies Swonke as the “third party beneficiary” of\n\nthe Fee Agreement.     See id. For these reasons, the April 16, 2004\n\nassignment conclusively proves that Swonke had standing and capacity\n\nto sue for breach of the Fee Agreement.\n\n     The second element of Swonke’s breach of contract claim—\n\nperformance by the plaintiff—is also undisputed and conclusively\n\nproved. Swonke promised in the Fee Agreement “to assist Anglo-Dutch\n\nand that firm [McConn & Williams, LLP] in this lawsuit [the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit] . . . .” The evidence at trial conclusively proved\n\nthat Swonke assisted Anglo-Dutch and McConn & Williams in the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit, by working on the lawsuit for 277 hours while of\n\ncounsel to Greenberg Peden and 1,022 hours while of counsel at\n\n\n\n                                   65\n\fMcConn & Williams. 1 CR 164, 184, 206, 216. Indeed, the trial court\n\nrecognized in its May 15, 2012 order that Anglo-Dutch had conceded\n\nthat Swonke assisted Anglo-Dutch on the Halliburton Lawsuit for 277\n\nhours while at Greenberg Peden (“In addition, the parties have agreed\n\nthat Swonke spent 277 hours on the representation while at Greenberg\n\nPeden . . . .”).22 For these reasons, Swonke’s performance of the Fee\n\nAgreement has been conclusively proved.\n\n              The third element of Swonke’s breach of contract claim—Anglo-\n\nDutch’s breach of the Fee Agreement—was proved in the original trial.\n\nThe jury found in response to Question 2 that Anglo-Dutch failed to\n\ncomply with the Fee Agreement.                                      1 CR 304.   The trial court\n\nincorporated the finding of breach into the 2007 Judgment. 1 CR 298.\n\nAnd Anglo-Dutch did not attack that finding on appeal: “Anglo-Dutch\n\ndoes not challenge on appeal the jury’s finding that it breached the fee\n\nagreement . . . .” See Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l v. Greenberg Peden,\n\nP.C., 267 S.W.3d 454, 464 n.5 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008),\n\nrev’d, 352 S.W.3d 445 (Tex. 2011). Consequently, Anglo-Dutch waived\n\nany attack on the jury’s breach finding and it remains undisturbed and\n\n                                                            \n22It is significant that Anglo-Dutch neither sought nor obtained a finding that\nSwonke did not comply with the Fee Agreement. See 1 CR 312-313.\n\n                                                               66\n\fin effect. See Guitar Holding Co., L.P., 263 S.W.3d at 918 (holding that\n\na lower court’s judgment remains in force and effect as to any issue it\n\ndecides that is not appealed); Biggar, 873 S.W.2d at 14-15 (holding that\n\na party waived all complaints about a damage award affirmed by the\n\ncourt of appeals by not complaining about it in the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt); see also JGR, Inc. v. Thomasville Furniture Indus., Inc., 550\n\nF.3d 529, 533 (6th Cir. 2008) (holding that a district court erred on\n\nremand by rendering judgment on a jury’s $3.3 million lost profits\n\nfinding because the district court’s previously-rendered judgment on a\n\n$0 lost profits finding had been waived on appeal).\n\n     The fourth element of Swonke’s breach of contract claim—\n\ndamages resulting from the breach—was also proved in the original\n\ntrial. The jury found in response to Question 3 that $1,000,000 would\n\nfairly and reasonably compensate Swonke for his damages resulting\n\nfrom Anglo-Dutch’s breach. 1 CR 305. The trial court incorporated the\n\n$1,000,000 damage finding into the 2007 Judgment. 1 CR 298. And\n\nAnglo-Dutch did not challenge that finding on appeal: “Anglo-Dutch\n\ndoes not challenge on appeal the amount of contract damages awarded\n\nfor that breach . . . .” See Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l v. Greenberg\n\n\n\n                                   67\n\fPeden, P.C., 267 S.W.3d 454, 464 n.5 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2008), rev’d, 352 S.W.3d 445 (Tex. 2011). Consequently, Anglo-Dutch\n\nwaived any attack on the jury’s damage finding and it remains\n\nundisturbed and in effect. See Guitar Holding Co., L.P., 263 S.W.3d at\n\n918 (holding that a lower court’s judgment remains in force and effect\n\nas to any issue it decides that is not appealed); Biggar, 873 S.W.2d at\n\n14-15 (holding that a party waived all complaints about a damage\n\naward affirmed by the court of appeals by not complaining about it in\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court); see also JGR, Inc., 550 F.3d at 533 (holding\n\nthat a district court erred on remand by rendering judgment on a jury’s\n\n$3.3 million lost profits finding because the district court’s previously-\n\nrendered judgment on a $0 lost profits finding had been waived on\n\nappeal).\n\n     Having established all four elements of his breach of contract\n\nclaim either through undisturbed jury findings or conclusive evidence,\n\nSwonke is entitled to the rendition of a judgment on that claim in the\n\namount of $1,000,000. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 301 (“The judgment of the\n\ncourt shall conform to the pleadings, the nature of the case proved and\n\n\n\n\n                                   68\n\fthe verdict, if any, and shall be so framed as to give the party all the\n\nrelief to which he may be entitled either in law or equity.”).\n\nIV.   The Trial Court Erred By Rendering A Judgment On Prejudgment\n      Interest, Post-Judgment Interest, And Costs That Conflicts With\n      Its 2007 Judgment, Which Remains In Force And Effect On Those\n      Issues.\n\n      A.   Anglo-Dutch Waived Any Complaints About The Trial\n           Court’s 2007 Judgment On Prejudgment Interest, Post-\n           Judgment Interest, And Costs.\n\n      The trial court has ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay Swonke\n\n$42,127.40 in prejudgment interest. See 1 CR 1304 at ¶ 13. However,\n\nthe trial court’s 2007 Judgment awarded Swonke $226,924.50 in\n\nprejudgment interest. 1 CR 299. Anglo-Dutch did not complain about\n\nthe trial court’s award of $226,924.50 in prejudgment interest in its\n\nappeal to this Court or the Texas Supreme Court. 1 CR SUPP 124-183,\n\n185-214, 216-269.\n\n      The trial court has also ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay Swonke post-\n\njudgment interest on $348,127.40. See 1 CR 1305 at ¶ 16. However,\n\nthe trial court’s 2007 Judgment ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay Swonke\n\npost-judgment interest on “this judgment and the amounts awarded\n\nherein,” i.e., $1,654,817. 1 CR 300. Anglo-Dutch did not complain in its\n\nappeal to this Court or the Texas Supreme Court about the trial court’s\n\n\n                                    69\n\forder to pay Swonke post-judgment interest on the 2007 Judgment and\n\nthe $1,654,817 awarded therein. 1 CR SUPP 124-183, 185-214, 216-\n\n269.\n\n       Finally, the trial court also ordered Swonke and Greenberg Peden\n\nto pay all court costs. See 1 CR 1304 at ¶ 15. However, the trial court’s\n\n2007 Judgment ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay all court costs. 1 CR 299.\n\nAnglo-Dutch did not complain about the trial court’s order to pay all\n\ncourt costs in its appeal to this Court or the Texas Supreme Court. 1\n\nCR SUPP 124-183, 185-214, 216-269.\n\n       Anglo-Dutch’s failure to complain on appeal about the 2007\n\nJudgment’s orders to pay $226,924.50 in prejudgment interest, post-\n\njudgment interest on $1,654,817, and costs waived any complaints\n\nabout those awards. See Allright, Inc. v. Pearson, 735 S.W.2d 240, 240-\n\n41 (Tex. 1987) (holding that a complaint about prejudgment interest is\n\nwaived if not made in the court of appeals); Wohlfahrt v. Holloway, 172\n\nS.W.3d 630, 639-40 (Tex. App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied)\n\n(holding that a complaint about an award of post-judgment interest\n\nmust be properly preserved or it is waived); Thomas v. Bilby-Knight,\n\nNo. 09-03-370CV, 2003 WL 22213590, at *1 (Tex. App.—Beaumont\n\n\n\n                                   70\n\f2003, no pet.) (“An issue relating to judgment for costs must be brought\n\nin a regular appeal.”); see also San Jacinto River Authority, 783 S.W.2d\n\nat 209-210 (stating that it is a “well-established rule that grounds of\n\nerror not asserted by points of error or argument in the court of appeals\n\nare waived).\n\n     B.    The 2007 Judgment’s Awards Of Prejudgment Interest,\n           Post-judgment Interest, And Costs Remain In Force And\n           Effect.\n\n     As previously noted, a lower court’s judgment remains in force and\n\neffect as to any issue it decides that is not appealed.      See Guitar\n\nHolding Co., L.P., 263 S.W.3d at 918; Bramlett, 359 S.W.3d at 311. And\n\na lower court’s judgment remains controlling on issues it decided that\n\nwere waived on appeal even when that judgment is “reversed” by a\n\nhigher court. See Phillips, 407 S.W.3d at 233, 237 (Tex. 2013); Guitar\n\nHolding Co., L.P., 263 S.W.3d at 918. Because Anglo-Dutch did not\n\nappeal to any court the 2007 Judgment’s awards of prejudgment\n\ninterest, post-judgment interest, or costs, those awards remain in force\n\nand effect. See Guitar Holding Co., 263 S.W.3d at 918; Bramlett, 359\n\nS.W.3d at 311.\n\n\n\n\n                                   71\n\f     C.   The Trial Court Erred By Altering Its Prior Awards Of\n          Prejudgment Interest, Post-judgment Interest, And Costs,\n          And Refusing To Render Judgment Consistent With Its 2007\n          Judgment.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch’s waiver of all complaints about the 2007 Judgment’s\n\nawards of prejudgment interest, post-judgment interest, and costs\n\nprohibited the trial court from altering those awards on remand\n\nbecause a trial court errs by rendering a judgment on remand that\n\nalters its own or a higher court’s prior judgment on an issue that was\n\nnot appealed.

You must not decide who you think should win, and then try to answer the\n                                  questions accordingly. Simply answer the questions, and do not discuss nor concern.\n                                  yourselves with th·e effect of your answers..                                     ·\n\n                                      5.

You may render your verdict upon the vote of ten or more members of the\n   jury. The same ten or more of you must agree upon all of the answers made and to\n    the entire verdict You will not, therefore, enter into an agreement to be bound by a.\n    majortty or any other vote of less than ten jurors. If the verdict and an of the answers\n    therein are reached by unanimous ?Qreement, the presiding juror shall sign the verdict\n    for the entire jury. If any juror disagrees as to any answer made by the verdict, those\n     jurors who agree to all findings shall each sign the verdict\n\n       These instructions are given you because your conduct is subject to review the\nsame as that of the witnesses, parties, attorneys am:j the judge.

Because these changes do not\n       affect the disposition of this appeal, we refer to \"Greenberg Peden\" throughout this opinion.\n2      In June 2001, Anglo-Dutch signed a promissory note in favor of Greenberg Peden for $231,749.16. Anglo-Dutch paid the note with\n       interest in December 2003, about two years after Greenberg Peden had dissolved.\n3      This settlement spawned a separate series oflawsuits and appeals involving investors who signed litigation funding agreements in\n       return for a portion of Anglo-Dutch's recovery from the lawsuit against Halliburton and Ramco. After the jury returned its verdict\n       against Halliburton and Ramco, Anglo-Dutch sought to reduce amounts it owed to investors who financed the lawsuit and a number\n       of those investors sued Anglo-Dutch.

The jury did not answer Question 6, asking the jury to\n       determine the amount of Swonke's fees under the fee agreement, because Question 6 was conditioned on the jury answering Question\n       5 in the negative and not answering Question 3 with a dollar amount. Further, the jury did not answer Question 7, asking if clear and\n       convincing evidence showed that Anglo-Dutch's harm resulted from malice or fraud, because it was conditioned on the jury answering\n       Question 5 in the negative. Lastly, the jury did not answer Question 8, addressing exemplary damages against Swonke for the harm\n       Anglo-Dutch suffered from Swonke's conduct, because it was conditioned on the jury answering Question 7 in the affirmative.\n5      Anglo-Dutch does not challenge on appeal the jury's finding that it breached the fee agreement; the amount of contract damages\n       awarded for that breach; or the separate statutory fee award for litigating Swonke's contract claim under the disputed fee agreement,\n       which the parties opted to try to the court. Anglo-Dutch also does not challenge the rendition of a take-nothing judgment in favor\n       of Greenberg Peden.\n6      Anglo-Dutch objected to this testimony only on hearsay grounds.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                       Governrnent VVorks,\n\fAPPENDIXD\n\f              Petroleum international, Inc. v.

On this issue the Court relies on the\n\nfollowing guidance:\n\n\n                (i)      October 16, 2000, Fee Agreement;\n\n                (ii)     Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int 'l, Inc. et al. v. Greenberg Peden, P. C., 352\n                         S.W.3d 445 (Tex. 2011).\n\n\nIn addition, the Court has reviewed the briefs and heard the oral arguments of the respective\n\nparties on this issue.\n\n        As to the threshold question, \"Who are the parties to the Fee Agreement?\" the Texas\n\nSupreme Court has unequivocally answered that question. The Supreme Court, after extensive\n\nbriefing and oral arguments, has stated the Fee Agreement was \"between Anglo-Dutch and\n\nGreenberg Peden.\" Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int'l, Inc., 352 S.W.3d at 453. As such, only\n\nSwanke's work while at Greenberg Peden is covered by the Fee Agreement.\n\n        From that starting point, the Court looks to the Fee Agreement to determine the\n\nappropriate formula for calculating the attorneys' fees. The Fee Agreement spells outs the\n\nfollowing:\n\n        I [Greenberg Peden] agree to assist Anglo-Dutch and that firm [McConn & Williams] in\n        this lawsuit [Cause No. 2000-22588; Anglo-Dutch (Fenge) eta!. v. Ramco et al., In the\n                                      RECORDER'S MEMORANDUM\n                                      This instrument is of poor quality                                     524\n                                            at the time of imaging\n\f        I 51st Judicial District Court ofHarris County, Texas] for proportionately the same\n        percentage (20%) of any benefit to McConn & Williams reflected in such agreement.\n        However, I will not be responsible for any expenses other than those I may personally\n        incur. Further, the proportions under which my fees shall be calculated will be the ratio of\n        the hours I have spent or will spend on this matter relative to the hours the attorneys at\n        McConn & Williams have spent or will spend after the date the lawsuit was filed,\n        rounded to the next whole percentage.\n\nFee Agreement, page 1. [not in original]\n\nThe Court reads the above recitals to result in the following formula:\n\n        Greenberg Peden Hours/McCmm Williams Hours= X (rounded up to the next whole\n        percentage) (XI). Xl x 20% = X2.\n\nThe Fee Agreement goes on to say that the factor X2 will be applied to \"gross revenues and other\n\nbenefits received\" to determine the attorneys' fees.\n\n        We know \"gross revenues\" to be $51,000,000.00 which represents the amount of the\n\nnegotiated settlement. In addition, the parties have agreed that Swanke spent 277 hours on the\n\nrepresentation while at Greenberg Peden and that McConn Williams spent 11,652 on the\n\nrepresentation. Hence, the Court makes the following calculation under the guidance of the\n\nTexas Supreme Court, the Fee Agreement, and the undisputed evidence:\n\n                277 Hours/11,652 Hours= 2.37% (rounded to 3%). 3% x 20% = .006% .\n                .006 X $51,000,000.00 = $306,000.00\n\nThus, under the Fee Agreement the Court determines that the attorneys' fees due to Greenberg\n\nPeden (and now Swanke by way of assignment) are $306,000.00. This determination will be\n\napplied to and will be used to resolve all outstanding issues remaining in the above captioned\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n                      MAY 1 5 2012\n        Signed _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              525\n\fAPPENDIXF\n\f                                    CAUSE NO. 2004-20712\n\nANGLO-DUTCH PETROLEUM                            §     IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF\nINTERNATIONAL, INC. and                          §\nANGLO-DUTCH (TENGE), LLC,                        §\n                                                 §                                       ~          ~\n                                                                                              .... .!It\n       PLAINTIFFS,                               §                                             .m\n                                                                                         filil c- ~ =              I\n                                                                                                          =\n                                                                                                          C'o.J\n                                                 §                                              cuU\nv.                                               §        HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS           ~~~\n                                                 §                                       ........ .c.     ~\nGREENBERG PEDEN, P.C. and                        §                                       ,....us          2\nGERARD J.

All parties appeared and announced\n\nready for trial. A jury was impaneled and sworn; it heard the evidence and arguments of counsel.\n\nIn response to the Charge of the Court, the jury made findings that the Court received, filed, and\n\nentered of record on January 15, 2014. The questions submitted to the jury and the jury's\n\nfindings are attached as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference.\n\n                                                   Post-Trial\n\n       Swanke and Greenberg Peden moved the Court to rule as a matter of law that Anglo-\n\nDutch waived its trial, appellate, and post-remand attorneys' fees and costs claims. The Court\n\ndenied that motion. Swanke and Greenberg Peden also moved the Court to disregard the jury's\n\nfindings to Questions 2(2) and 4(B). The Court initially denied that motion, but upon\n\nreconsideration has agreed to that motion. Specifically, after considering the evidence introduced\n\nat trial, the jury's verdict, and the entire record, the Court finds that an award of attorneys' fees\n\nor costs to Anglo-Dutch would not be equitable or just.\n\n                                     RECORDER'S MEMORANDUM\n                                     Th1s mstrument IS of poor qualrty\n                                          at the t1me of 1magmg\n                                                                                                    1302\n\f       Anglo-Dutch moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Court denied that\n\nmotion.\n\n                                          Judgment Decrees\n\n          Based upon the Court's pretrial rulings, the jury's verdict, and the post-verdict arguments\n\nof counsel, the judgment should be and is now hereby RENDERED as set forth below:\n\n          1.     As requested in Plaintiffs' First Amended Petition at page 7,    ~   23(a), the Court\n\nDECLARES that the Fee Agreement is between Anglo-Dutch and Greenberg Peden, and not\n\nbetween Anglo-Dutch and Swanke individually.\n\n          2.     As requested in Plaintiffs' First Amended Petition at 7 ~ 23(c), the Court\n\nDECLARES that: (1) the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula in the Fee Agreement is\n\nthe hours Greenberg Peden worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit and does not include the hours\n\nSwanke worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams; and (2) the\n\nhours Swanke worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams are\n\nincluded in the denominator in the fee fommla in the Fee Agreement.\n\n          3.

You may discus~ the case\n             with other jurors only when you are all together in the jury room.\n\n                   'Remember my previous instructions: Do not discuss the case with anyone\n                       l\n\n             else, either in person or by any other means. Do not do any independent\n             investigation about the case or conduct any research. Do not look up any words in\n             dictionaries or. on the Internet. Do not post information about the case on the\n             Internet. Do not share any special knowledge or experiences with the other jurors.\n             Do not use your phone or any other electronic device during your deliberations for\n             any reason. I will give you a number where others may contact you in case of an\n             emergency.\n\n                    Any notes you have taken are for your own personal use. You may take your\n             notes back into the jury room and consult them during deliberations, but do not show\n             or read your notes to your fellow jurors during your deliberations. Your notes are\n             not evidence. Each of you should rely on your independent recollection of the\n             evidence and not be influenced by the fact that another juror has or has not taken\n             notes.\n\n                    You must leave your notes with the bailiff when you are not deliberating. The\n             bailiff will give your notes to me promptly after collecting them from you. I will\n             make sure your notes are kept in a safe, secure location and not disclosed to anyone.\n             After you complete your deliberations, the bailiff will collect your notes. When you\n\n\n\n\n                                               EXHIBIT A\n                                                                                                1306\n\f       are reJeased from jury duty, the bailiff will promptly destroy your notes so that\n       nobody can read what you wrote.\n\n             Here are the instructions for answering the questions.\n\n                   1.     Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your\n                          decision.\n\n                   2.     Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on\n                          the law that is in these instructions and questions. Do not\n                          consider or discuss any evidence that was not admitted in the\n                          courtroom.\n\n                   3.     You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the\n                          sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to\n                          give their testimony. But on matters of Jaw, you must follow all\n                          of my instructions.\n\n                   4.     If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its\n                          ordinary meaning, use the meaning I give you, which will be a\n                          proper legal definition.\n\n                   5.     All the questions and answers are important. No one should say\n                          that any question or answer is not important.\n\n                    6.    Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all questions unless you are told\n                          otherwise. A \"yes\" answer must be based on a preponderance of\n                          the evidence unless you are told otherwise. Whenever a question\n                          requires an answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\" your answer must\n                          be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are told\n                          otherwise.\n\n                          The tenn \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater\n                          weight of credible evidence presented in this case. If you do not\n                          find that a preponderance of the evidence supports a \"yes\"\n....                      answer, then answer \"no.\" A preponderance of the evidence is\n<!)\n..0\nE\n                          not measured by the number of witnesses or by the number of\n:>\nz                         documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be proved by a\n                          preponderance of the evidence, you must find that the fact is\n                          more likely true than not true.\n                                             Page 2 of 12\n\n\n\n                                         EXHIBIT A\n                                                                                        1307\n\f                   7.     Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the\n                          questions and then just answer the questions to match your\n                          decision. Answer each question carefully without considering\n                          who will win. Do not discuss or consider the effect your answers\n                          will have.\n\n                   8.     Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of\n                          chance.\n\n                   9.     Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree\n                          in advance to decide on a dollar amount by adding up each\n                          juror's amount and then figuring the average.\n\n                    10.   Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say, \"I will\n                          answer this question your way if you answer another question\n                          my way.\"\n\n                    11.   Unless otherwise instructed, the answers to the questions must be\n                          based on the decision of at least ten of the twelve jurors. The\n                          same ten jurors must agree on every answer. Do not agree to be\n                          bound by a vote of anything less than ten jurors, even if it would\n                          be a majority.\n\n\n\n              As I have said before, if you do not follow these instructions, you will be\n       guilty of juror misconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this\n       process over again. This would waste your time and the parties' money, and would\n       require the taxpayers of this county to pay for another trial. If a juror breaks any of\n       these rules, tell that person to stop and report it to me immediately.\n\n\n\n\n5\nE\n;:l\n 0\n D\nQ\n\"'\n u\n<;:;\n                                             Page 3 of 12\n ...\n <I)\n\nu\n                                         EXHIBIT A\n                                                                                           1308\n\fQUESTION NO. 1:\n\n\n       What are the fees for the services of Anglo-Dutch Petroleum International,\nInc. and Anglo-Dutch (Tenge), LLC's attorneys, stated in dollars and cents?\n\n     You are instructed to include only fees for services that relate to Anglo-\nDutch Petroleum International, Inc. and Anglo-Dutch (Tenge), LLC's declaratory\njudgment claims.\n\n        You are further instructed that if any attorney's fees relate solely to a claim\nfor which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from\nunrecoverable fees.

Unless otherwise instructed, you may answer the questions on a\n           vote of ten jurors. The same ten jurors must agree on every answer in the\n           charge.

If ten jurors agree on every answer, those ten jurors sign the\n           verdict.\n\n                  If eleven jurors agree on every answer, those eleven jurors sign the\n           verdict.\n\n                 If all twelve of you agree on every answer, you are unanimous and only\n           the presidingjuror signs the verdict.\n\n                                          Page 10of12\n\n\n\n                                      EXHIBIT A\n                                                                                       1315\n\f      3.

Did the trial court misconstrue the numerator and rounding\n              provisions of the Fee Agreement and erroneously order Anglo-\n              Dutch to pay Swonke $306,000 instead of $1,530,000?14\n\nII.           Did the trial court err by rendering judgment against—and\n              refusing to render judgment for—Swonke on his attorneys’ fees\n              claims?15\n\nIII.

Did the trial court err by rendering a judgment on prejudgment\n              interest, post-judgment interest, and costs that conflicts with its\n              2007 Judgment, which remains in force and effect on those\n              issues?17 \n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n14   This issue attacks judgment decrees 2(1), 4, 5, 6, and 9 in the 2014 Judgment.\n\n15   This issue attacks judgment decrees 8, 11, and 12 in the 2014 Judgment.\n\n16   This issue attacks judgment decree 7 in the 2014 Judgment.\n\n17   This issue attacks judgment decrees 13, 15, and 16 in the 2014 Judgment.\n\n                                                                      xx\n\f                      STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nI.   The Underlying Dispute\n\n     Gerard Swonke has been a lawyer for 41-years who was “of\n\ncounsel” to Greenberg Peden, P.C. or its predecessor from 1987 until\n\nNovember 2001. 1 CR 248-250, 1 CR 258. Scott Van Dyke worked for\n\nVan Dyke Energy Company (later Vanco Energy Company), his father’s\n\noil company, where he spent 50% of his time negotiating and preparing\n\ncontracts. Swonke first met Van Dyke in 1987 through Van Dyke’s\n\nfather. 1 CR 251-253. Soon thereafter, Swonke began to represent Van\n\nDyke’s father’s company. 1 CR 253.\n\n     In 1989, Van Dyke and his mother formed Anglo-Dutch Petroleum\n\nInternational, Inc., an exploration company. 1 CR 168-171. Van Dyke\n\nserved as its president. 1 CR 185-186. Beginning in 1993, Van Dyke\n\nbecame the chief architect and negotiator of an elaborate limited\n\nliability agreement that brought together disparate investor interests\n\nfrom several countries to pursue a license in Kazakhstan for the\n\ndevelopment of the Tenge oil and gas field. 1 CR 230, 257. Swonke\n\ndrafted the formal documents and obtained the assistance of Skip\n\nNaylor, a Greenberg Peden shareholder, to help document the\n\n\n\n                                  1\n\ftransaction. 1 CR 231, 257. Anglo-Dutch (Tenge) L.L.C. was the entity\n\nformed to complete the transaction. See 1 CR 231.\n\n       In   1997,   Swonke   negotiated   and   drafted   confidentiality\n\nagreements that Halliburton and Ramco executed in order to view\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s confidential data regarding the Tenge field to assess a\n\nproposed buyout of Anglo-Dutch’s existing partners. 1 CR 172-175. In\n\nFebruary 2000, Anglo-Dutch requested that Swonke examine the\n\nviability of a potential lawsuit against Halliburton and Ramco for\n\nbreaching the confidentiality agreements. 1 CR 187, 260-261. Swonke\n\nconcluded a lawsuit was viable and so advised Anglo-Dutch. 1 CR 188,\n\n262.\n\n       Although Anglo-Dutch wished to pursue the lawsuit, it did not\n\nhave the financial resources to do so on an hourly basis. 1 CR 176.\n\nAnglo-Dutch owed Greenberg Peden a large sum of money. 1 CR 221.\n\nFor that reason, Greenberg Peden previously had decided and told Van\n\nDyke that it would no longer represent Anglo-Dutch in any matters. 1\n\nCR 208-209, 225-226, 258-259, 232-234.      Nevertheless, as required\n\nunder Swonke’s “of counsel” agreement with Greenberg Peden, Swonke\n\nfirst approached Greenberg Peden and asked if it would represent\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\fAnglo-Dutch against Halliburton and Ramco. 1 CR 232-233, 217, 235 ¶\n\n8. Greenberg Peden flatly refused. 1 CR 218-220, 222-226, 232-233,\n\n235, 237-238, 241-242. Swonke and David Peden, a named shareholder\n\nof Greenberg Peden, both informed Van Dyke that Greenberg Peden\n\nwould not represent it against Halliburton and Ramco, a fact even Van\n\nDyke concedes. 1 CR 188, 208-209, 225-226, 233, 237-238, 241-243.\n\n     Swonke then referred the case to McConn & Williams without\n\nseeking a referral fee. 1 CR 263. McConn & Williams signed a fee\n\nagreement with Anglo-Dutch on March 25, 2000 and filed Anglo-Dutch\n\n(Tenge) L.L.C., et al. v. Ramco Oil & Gas, Ltd., et al.; in the 61st Judicial\n\nDistrict Court of Harris County, Texas, Cause No. 2000-22588\n\n(“Halliburton Lawsuit”) on May 2, 2000.          1 CR 318-325, 177-178.\n\nMcConn & Williams later associated with John O’Quinn to try the case.\n\n1 CR 236.\n\n     After Anglo-Dutch hired McConn & Williams, Van Dyke and\n\nMcConn & Williams’ lawyers frequently asked Swonke for advice and to\n\nperform tasks on the Halliburton Lawsuit even though at that time\n\nSwonke had no agreement with Anglo-Dutch or McConn & Williams by\n\nwhich he would be paid for his efforts. 1 CR 264-266. After several\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\fmonths of such requests, Swonke finally concluded that he had to be\n\ncompensated if he was going to continue to work on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit. 1 CR 266.\n\n       Van Dyke called Swonke and specifically asked to retain him, not\n\nGreenberg Peden, to work on the Halliburton Lawsuit on a contingent\n\nfee because he could not afford to pay Swonke by the hour. 1 CR 267-\n\n268. Van Dyke suggested a contingency fee based on a formula. 1 CR\n\n268.    Swonke and Anglo-Dutch agreed to Van Dyke’s terms, which\n\nSwonke dictated into a Dictaphone. 1 CR 269-271. Swonke then asked\n\nhis secretary to transcribe his dictation and finalize the document. 1\n\nCR 272.\n\n       The body of the Fee Agreement never mentions Greenberg Peden.\n\n1 CR 312. Instead, the body of the Fee Agreement exclusively uses the\n\npersonal pronouns “I”, “me”, and “my” twelve times in a nine-sentence\n\ncontract to refer to Swonke, individually, and his rights and obligations\n\nunder the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 312-313.\n\n       Swonke’s secretary inadvertently put the Fee Agreement on\n\nGreenberg Peden letterhead and inserted “GREENBERG PEDEN, P.C.”\n\ninto the signature block.    1 CR 272.    Swonke then signed the Fee\n\n\n\n                                   4\n\fAgreement on October 16, 2000, never noticing the references to\n\nGreenberg Peden in the letterhead and in the signature block. 1 CR\n\n273, 312. Van Dyke signed the Fee Agreement the next day for Anglo-\n\nDutch. 1 CR 313.\n\n     Swonke had no intention to, did not, and could not—because of\n\nGreenberg Peden’s prohibition on doing work for Anglo-Dutch—act for\n\nGreenberg Peden by signing the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 207. Instead,\n\nSwonke signed the contract for himself individually. 1 CR 282. Swonke\n\nhas never signed a contingency fee contract on behalf of Greenberg\n\nPeden. 1 CR 215. Indeed, when Greenberg Peden signs a contingency\n\nfee contract with a client, a Greenberg Peden attorney executes the fee\n\nagreement. 1 CR 211. Greenberg Peden had flatly refused to represent\n\nAnglo-Dutch in the Halliburton Lawsuit and told Van Dyke so—thus,\n\nSwonke had no authority to sign the Fee Agreement on behalf of\n\nGreenberg Peden, a fact known by Van Dyke. 1 CR 188, 208-209, 218-\n\n220, 222-226, 232-233, 235, 237-238, 241-243.      Naylor, Greenberg\n\nPeden’s managing shareholder, agreed that Swonke did not execute the\n\nFee Agreement on behalf of Greenberg Peden. 1 CR 239-240.\n\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\f     After signing the Fee Agreement, Swonke worked on the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit for 277 hours while physically present at\n\nGreenberg Peden’s offices. 1 CR 216. On October 26, 2001, Swonke\n\nbecame “of counsel” to McConn & Williams. 1 CR 347-350. Swonke\n\ninformed Anglo-Dutch that he was taking its files, including the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit, with him to his “of counsel” position at McConn &\n\nWilliams unless Anglo-Dutch objected. 1 CR 354. Anglo-Dutch did not\n\nobject. 1 CR 193-194. Because Swonke was to be compensated for his\n\nwork on the Halliburton Lawsuit under the Fee Agreement, Swonke’s\n\n“of counsel” agreement with McConn & Williams provided that McConn\n\n& Williams would not share any fees with Swonke that it derived from\n\nthe Halliburton Lawsuit.     See 1 CR 349.       With Anglo-Dutch’s\n\nknowledge, Swonke then worked 1,022 hours on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit while “of counsel” at McConn & Williams. 1 CR 206.\n\n     On May 7, 2002, six months after Van Dyke learned that Swonke\n\nhad physically left Greenberg Peden to become “of counsel” to McConn\n\n& Williams, Van Dyke was deposed in the Halliburton Lawsuit. Van\n\nDyke expressly testified that Anglo-Dutch had a fee agreement with\n\nSwonke. 1 CR 195, 247. Van Dyke did not remotely suggest during his\n\n\n\n                                  6\n\fdeposition that Anglo-Dutch had a fee agreement with Greenberg\n\nPeden. 1 CR 195.\n\n     The jury in the Halliburton Lawsuit rendered a $70,500,000\n\nverdict for Anglo-Dutch against Halliburton and Ramco.       1 CR 179.\n\nHalliburton and Ramco then stipulated that Anglo-Dutch incurred\n\nreasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees of $9,800,000. 1 CR 192. The\n\nattorneys’ time for which Anglo-Dutch recovered attorneys’ fees\n\nincluded the 1,022 hours that Swonke worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit while “of counsel” to McConn & Williams. 1 CR 204, 216.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch eventually settled with Halliburton for $51,000,000\n\non April 1, 2004, and Halliburton funded the settlement on April 15,\n\n2004. 1 CR 180, 378. During this period, Swonke repeatedly emailed\n\nVan Dyke about the calculation of his fee, directed Van Dyke’s attention\n\nto the fact that Swonke’s wiring instructions were not included with\n\nthose of other attorneys who received their fees directly from\n\nHalliburton, and asked Van Dyke to promptly address “my contract.” 1\n\nCR 364, 368, 373, 383. Van Dyke never suggested in response to these\n\ncommunications that he believed Swonke was not a party to the Fee\n\nAgreement. See 1 CR 205, 279. Instead, Van Dyke expressed concern\n\n\n\n                                   7\n\fthat Greenberg Peden may make a claim for a fee because the Fee\n\nAgreement was on Greenberg Peden letterhead. To address Van Dyke’s\n\nconcern and at his request, on April 16, 2004, before this lawsuit was\n\nfiled, Swonke obtained an assignment from Greenberg Peden of any\n\nrights it had under the Fee Agreement. See 1 CR 385.\n\n       On April 20, 2004, Van Dyke met with a lawyer and discussed\n\nissues related to Swonke. 1 CR 183. On April 22, 2004, Swonke met\n\nwith Van Dyke and, for the first time, Van Dyke asserted that the Fee\n\nAgreement is between Anglo-Dutch and Greenberg Peden, shocking\n\nSwonke. 1 CR 274-275, 280. Swonke left the meeting, telling Van Dyke\n\n“I can’t believe you’re going to do this to me and my family.” 1 CR 281.\n\nSeveral hours later, Anglo-Dutch sued Swonke, asserting that Anglo-\n\nDutch’s Fee Agreement was with Greenberg Peden, not Swonke. 1 CR\n\n286.\n\n       Like it did with Swonke’s Fee Agreement, Anglo-Dutch also\n\nattempted to avoid numerous other contracts that required it to share\n\nthe settlement from the Halliburton Lawsuit.      For example, Anglo-\n\nDutch executed 33 contracts that would have required it to pay\n\napproximately $11,000,000 of the settlement to investors in the\n\n\n\n                                   8\n\fHalliburton Lawsuit. 1 CR 196-199. However, Van Dyke did not pay\n\nany of the investors the amount they contracted for, thereby saving $4-5\n\nmillion. 1 CR 198, 200. Like Swonke, at least eight of the investors\n\nsuccessfully sued Anglo-Dutch for breach of contract. See, e.g., Anglo-\n\nDutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v.

The Trial Court—Part I\n\n        Anglo-Dutch sued Swonke and Greenberg Peden for a declaratory\n\njudgment, negligence, gross negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary\n\nduty.     1 CR 286-290.      Anglo-Dutch sought the following seven\n\ndeclarations regarding the Fee Agreement:\n\n           the Fee Agreement is between Anglo-Dutch and Greenberg\n            Peden, and not between Anglo-Dutch and Swonke,\n            individually;\n\n           Greenberg Peden’s April 16, 2004 assignment of its rights\n            and interest in the Fee Agreement to Swonke is illegal and\n            unenforceable against Anglo-Dutch;\n\n\n\n                                   9\n\f        the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula in the\n         Fee Agreement is the hours Greenberg Peden worked on the\n         Halliburton Lawsuit and does not include the hours Swonke\n         worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to\n         McConn & Williams;\n\n        the hours Swonke worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit while\n         of counsel to McConn & Williams are included in the\n         denominator in the fee formula in the Fee Agreement;\n\n        the rounding up to the next whole percentage that is\n         required by the Fee Agreement occurs after the hours ratio\n         is determined and before, not after, the hours ratio is\n         multiplied by 20%.\n\n        the contingency fee owed under the Fee Agreement shall\n         remain in direct correlation to McConn & Williams’\n         contingency fee percentage—whether the McConn &\n         Williams contingency fee percentage increases or decreases;\n         and\n\n        neither Swonke nor Greenberg Peden can recover any\n         contingency fee under the Fee Agreement from any future\n         recovery against Ramco.\nSee 1 CR 286-287.    In addition, Anglo-Dutch sought fee forfeiture,\n\nactual damages, exemplary damages, and attorneys’ fees. 1 CR SUPP\n\n114. Swonke counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment, for breach of\n\ncontract against Anglo-Dutch, and for fraud against both Anglo-Dutch\n\nand Van Dyke. 1 CR 293-294. Swonke sought actual damages and\n\nattorneys’ fees. 1 CR SUPP 100.\n\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\f     After two weeks of testimony, the jury found in response to\n\nQuestion 1 that the Fee Agreement with Anglo-Dutch was entered into\n\non behalf of Swonke, individually, and not on behalf of Greenberg\n\nPeden. See 1 CR 303. In response to Question 2, the jury found that\n\nAnglo-Dutch breached the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 304. The jury found in\n\nresponse to Question 3 that $1,000,000 would fairly and reasonably\n\ncompensate Swonke for his damages that resulted from Anglo-Dutch’s\n\nbreach of the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 305. In response to Question 5, the\n\njury found that Swonke complied with his fiduciary duty to Anglo-\n\nDutch. 1 CR 306. Finally, the jury found in response to Question 9 that\n\nVan Dyke did not commit fraud against Swonke. 1 CR 307.\n\n     The trial court rendered judgment on the jury’s verdict on\n\nJanuary 22, 2007 (the “2007 Judgment”). 1 CR 298. That judgment\n\nordered Anglo-Dutch to take nothing from Swonke and Greenberg\n\nPeden.   1 CR 298.    The judgment also ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay\n\nSwonke $1,000,000 and prejudgment interest on that amount of\n\n$226,924.50.   1 CR 299.   Finally, the judgment also ordered Anglo-\n\nDutch to pay Swonke the following attorneys’ fees for the prosecution of\n\nhis breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims, and his defense\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\fof Anglo-Dutch’s declaratory judgment claims:      $352,892.50 for trial;\n\n$75,000 if Anglo-Dutch unsuccessfully appealed to the court of appeals;\n\nand $50,000 if Anglo-Dutch unsuccessfully appealed to the Texas\n\nSupreme Court. 1 CR 299.\n\nIII.

The Texas Supreme Court’s opinion\n\nstates: “The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the case\n\nis remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                    16\n\fV.   The Trial Court—Part II\n\n     Upon remand, the trial court declared as a matter of law, among\n\nother declarations, that: (1) the rounding up to the next whole\n\npercentage that is required by the Fee Agreement occurs before the\n\nhours ratio is multiplied by 20%; (2) the numerator in the fee formula is\n\nthe hours Greenberg Peden spent on the Halliburton Lawsuit; and (3)\n\nAnglo-Dutch owed Swonke $306,000 under the Fee Agreement. 1 CR\n\n524-525.\n\n     The trial court also rendered an interlocutory summary judgment\n\nordering, among other things, that: (1) Swonke take nothing on his\n\nbreach of contract counterclaim; (2) Swonke take nothing on his request\n\nfor attorneys’ fees under chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code; (3) Swonke take nothing on his declaratory judgment\n\ncounterclaim; and (4) Swonke is precluded from recovering attorneys’\n\nfees under section 37.009 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode. 1 CR 668-669.\n\n     Finally, the Court held a three-day jury trial on the issues of\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s trial, appellate, and post-remand attorneys’ fees and\n\ncosts. 1 CR 1302. The jury answered “$0” nine times in response to\n\n\n\n                                   17\n\feleven subquestions in the jury charge. 1 CR 1309-1314. However, the\n\njury also found that $50,000 was a reasonable fee for the necessary\n\nservices of Anglo-Dutch’s attorneys for representation for the prior\n\nappeal to the Texas Supreme Court and that $12,000 was the\n\nreasonable and necessary costs that Anglo-Dutch incurred in its appeal\n\nto this Court and the Texas Supreme Court. 1 CR 1311, 1314. The trial\n\ncourt granted Swonke’s motion to disregard the jury’s findings on those\n\ntwo questions and also ruled that an award of attorneys’ fees or costs to\n\nAnglo-Dutch would not be equitable or just. 1 CR 1302.\n\n\n\n\n                                   18\n\f                  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n     Eleven years ago, Anglo-Dutch settled a lawsuit for $51,000,000\n\nand then refused to pay one of its lawyers, Swonke, the amount it had\n\nagreed to pay him.   Adding insult to injury, Anglo-Dutch then sued\n\nSwonke. Thus began this litigation odyssey.\n\n     A jury, a trial court (now Fourteenth Court of Appeals) judge,\n\nthree court of appeals justices, and four Texas Supreme Court justices\n\nfound that the parties’ Fee Agreement was between Anglo-Dutch and\n\nSwonke.   However, five justices on the Texas Supreme Court held\n\nthat—notwithstanding Greenberg Peden’s express refusal to represent\n\nAnglo-Dutch, and Van Dyke’s testimony that Anglo-Dutch had a fee\n\nagreement with Swonke—the Fee Agreement was between Anglo-Dutch\n\nand Greenberg Peden, not Swonke, as a matter of law.\n\n     On remand, Anglo-Dutch treated the Supreme Court’s declaration\n\nregarding the parties to the Fee Agreement as a panacea despite its\n\ninsignificance. Although the Supreme Court did not address or decide\n\nhow much money was owed under the Fee Agreement because Anglo-\n\nDutch did not appeal the take-nothing judgment on the declarations\n\nthat would have presented that issue, at Anglo-Dutch’s invitation the\n\n\n\n                                 19\n\ftrial court literally rewrote the Fee Agreement in contravention of its\n\nplain language and the Supreme Court’s opinion.       The trial court’s\n\nmistaken construction of the Fee Agreement resulted in a judgment for\n\nSwonke of $306,000 instead of the $1,530,000 the parties agreed he\n\nwould be paid.\n\n     The remainder of the trial court’s errors on remand resulted\n\nprimarily from its failure to acknowledge and apply a fundamental rule\n\nof appellate practice:   issues decided in a judgment that are not\n\nappealed are waived and not remanded for a second bite at the apple,\n\neven if the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded. In other\n\nwords, a trial court errs by rendering a judgment on remand that alters\n\nits own or a higher court’s prior judgment on an issue that was not\n\nappealed because the waived judgment on the issue remains in force\n\nand effect.   This waiver doctrine serves judicial economy by forcing\n\nparties to raise issues whose resolution might spare the courts and\n\nparties successive rounds of remands and appeals.\n\n     The trial court ran afoul of the waiver doctrine by rendering\n\ndeclarations on remand which had previously been sought, refused by\n\nthe 2007 Judgment, and not appealed.        Similarly, the trial court\n\n\n\n                                  20\n\fawarded Swonke attorneys’ fees, pre- and post-judgment interest, and\n\ncosts in its 2007 Judgment that were not appealed. Nevertheless, the\n\ntrial court erroneously eliminated or altered those awards on remand.\n\n     Despite the trial court’s errors, Swonke had decided to forego an\n\nappeal to allow this litigation to end until forced to cross-appeal by\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s perfection of its appeal. A proper construction of the Fee\n\nAgreement and application of the waiver doctrine will allow a lawyer\n\nwho helped enrich his client to get paid the agreed amount for his\n\nservices and end this litigation once and for all.\n\n                               ARGUMENT\n\nI.   The Trial Court Erred By Misconstruing The Numerator And\n     Rounding Provisions Of The Fee Agreement, And By Ordering\n     Anglo-Dutch To Pay Swonke $306,000 Instead Of $1,530,000\n     Under The Fee Agreement.\n\n     On remand, the trial court construed the Fee Agreement as a\n\nmatter of law and ruled, among other things, that: (1) the numerator in\n\nthe fee formula is the hours Greenberg Peden spent on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit, and does not include the hours Swonke worked on the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams; and (2)\n\nthe rounding up to the next whole percentage that is required by the\n\nFee Agreement occurs after the hours ratio is determined and before,\n\n\n                                     21\n\fnot after, the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%. See 1 CR 524-525; 1 CR\n\n1303. The trial court then applied its rulings in light of the parties’\n\nstipulations that: (a) Anglo-Dutch’s gross recovery in the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit was $51,000,000, (b) Swonke worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit for 277 hours while of counsel to Greenberg Peden; and (c)\n\nMcConn & Williams’ attorneys, and Swonke while of counsel to McConn\n\n& Williams, worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit for a total of 11,652\n\nhours. See 1 CR 524-525; 1 CR 1303-1304.\n\n     Based on its construction of the Fee Agreement and the parties’\n\nstipulations, the trial court rendered judgment:     (A) declaring the\n\nnumerator in the fee formula to be Greenberg Peden’s hours and not\n\nSwonke’s hours; (B) declaring that the rounding up required by the Fee\n\nAgreement occurs before the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%; and (C)\n\nordering Anglo-Dutch to pay Swonke $306,000 under the Fee\n\nAgreement. See 1 CR 525; 1 CR 1303-1304. As shown below, the trial\n\ncourt erred by rendering judgment on Anglo-Dutch’s requested\n\nnumerator and rounding declarations because Anglo-Dutch waived any\n\nentitlement to the declarations and, in any event, the declarations\n\nmisconstrue the Fee Agreement by rewriting its plain language in\n\n\n\n                                  22\n\fviolation of the Supreme Court’s opinion. These mistakes resulted in\n\nthe rendition of an incorrect judgment ordering Anglo-Dutch to pay\n\nSwonke $306,000 instead of $1,530,000 under the Fee Agreement.\n\n     A.     Anglo-Dutch Waived The Declarations Regarding The\n            Numerator And Rounding Provisions Because The Trial\n            Court’s 2007 Judgment Denied That Relief And That Denial\n            Was Not Appealed.\n\n     The trial court decreed in its final judgment: “As requested in\n\nPlaintiffs’ First Amended Petition at 7 ¶ 23(c), the Court DECLARES\n\nthat . . . the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula in the Fee\n\nAgreement is the hours Greenberg Peden worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit and does not include the hours Swonke worked on the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams . . . .” 1 CR\n\n1303 ¶ 2.    The trial court also decreed in its final judgment:     “As\n\nrequested in Plaintiffs’ First Amended Petition at 7-8 ¶ 23(d), the Court\n\nDECLARES that the rounding up to the next whole percentage that is\n\nrequired by the Fee Agreement occurs after the hours ratio is\n\ndetermined [and] before, not after, the hours ratio is multiplied by\n\n20%.” See 1 CR 1303 ¶ 4.\n\n     However, Anglo-Dutch sought these same declarations in the first\n\ntrial, 1 CR SUPP 110-111 ¶¶ 23(c), 23(d), the trial court rendered a\n\n\n                                   23\n\ftake-nothing judgment on these requested declarations in its 2007\n\nJudgment, 1 CR SUPP 120, and Anglo-Dutch did not complain about\n\nthe take-nothing judgment on these declaratory judgment claims in its\n\nappeal to this Court or the Texas Supreme Court. 1 CR SUPP 124-183,\n\n185-214, 216-269.\n\n     Consequently, Anglo-Dutch waived its claims seeking these\n\ndeclarations.

The Supreme Court’s Opinion Requires Enforcement\n                   Of The Unambiguous Fee Agreement As Written.\n\n     The Texas Supreme Court concluded that the Fee Agreement was\n\nunambiguous.       See Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 452\n\n(“Given our conclusion that the agreement was not ambiguous . . . .”).\n\nThe Supreme Court also required the Fee Agreement to be enforced as\n\n\n\n\n                                   27\n\fwritten.

Nor does the fee calculation, based solely on the\n     hours Swonke spent individually, suggest that others at\n     Greenberg Peden were excluded from the work.

Further, the proportions under which my fees shall be\n     calculated will be the ratio of the hours I have spent or will\n     spend on this matter relative to the hours the attorneys at\n     McConn & Williams have spent or will spend after the date\n     the lawsuit was filed, rounded to the next whole percentage.\n     For example, if McConn & Williams' attorneys spend 1,000\n\n\n                                   29\n\f     hours on the lawsuit after the date the lawsuit was filed and\n     I spend 90 hours of my time towards the lawsuit, then by\n     rounding up to the nearest whole number, I would be\n     entitled to receive from you 2% (10% of 20%) of the gross\n     revenues and other benefits recovered, if any, from this\n     lawsuit.\n\n1 CR 312.\n\n     For clarity, the Fee Agreement contains an example that shows\n\nwhen the rounding to the next whole percentage occurs.             In the\n\nexample, the hours ratio (90/1000) is multiplied by 20% resulting in a\n\nfee of 1.8%, which is then rounded up to 2%. Expressed algebraically,\n\nthe example is: 90/1000 x 20% = 1.8% = 2% when rounded up to the\n\nnext whole percentage. Thus, the plain language of the Fee Agreement\n\nshows that the rounding up to the next whole percentage that is\n\nrequired occurs after, not before, the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%.\n\n            2.   The Supreme Court’s Opinion Prohibits Rewriting The\n                 Fee Agreement Or Adding To Its Language.\n\n     The corollary to the Texas Supreme Court’s mandate that\n\nunambiguous fee agreements be enforced as written is its prohibition on\n\ncourts rewriting or adding language to unambiguous contracts.

The Trial Court Rewrote The Hours Ratio In The\n                       Fee Formula At Anglo-Dutch’s Request.\n\n     Incredibly, notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s prohibition on\n\nrewriting or adding language to the unambiguous Fee Agreement,\n\nAnglo-Dutch expressly invited the trial court to “re-write” the Fee\n\nAgreement:\n\n     Since the Supreme Court of Texas ruled that the Fee\n     Agreement was with GP and not Swonke, it is clearer, for\n     analytical purposes, to re-write the Fee Agreement and\n     replace the pronouns with the term GP . . . .”\n\n1 CR 415 (emphasis added). Specifically, Anglo-Dutch asked the trial\n\ncourt to re-write the key phrase regarding the numerator in the hours\n\nratio from “the ratio of the hours I have spent or will spend on this\n\nmatter” to “the ratio of the hours GP has spent or will spend on this\n\nmatter”:\n\n     Further, the proportions under which GP’s fees shall be\n     calculated will be the ratio of the hours GP has spent or will\n     spend on this matter relative to the hours the attorneys at\n     McConn & Williams have spent or will spend after the date\n     the lawsuit was filed, rounded to the next whole percentage.\n\n\n\n\n                                    31\n\fId. at 416 (emphasis added); accord id. (“One need simply determine\n\nthe hours GP spent on the matter and divide them by the hours that\n\nMW spent on the matter . . . .”) (emphasis added).\n\n     The trial court accepted Anglo-Dutch’s invitation and held that\n\n“the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula in the Fee\n\nAgreement is the hours Greenberg Peden worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit,” 1 CR 1303 ¶¶ 2-4, or, in another instance, simply inserted\n\n“Greenberg Peden Hours” into the hours ratio in the fee formula. 1 CR\n\n524-525. But the Fee Agreement does not state, as the trial court held,\n\nthat the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula is “Greenberg\n\nPeden’s hours” or only the hours Swonke worked “while at Greenberg\n\nPeden.”\n\n     Without any support in the language of the Fee Agreement, the\n\ntrial court rewrote the fee formula by:     (1) substituting “Greenberg\n\nPeden” in two places for “I” in the Fee Agreement; and/or (2) adding\n\n“while at Greenberg Peden” to restrict Swonke’s hours in the numerator\n\nof the fee formula to those hours he worked while at Greenberg Peden.\n\nIn doing so, the trial court erred by enforcing an agreement the parties\n\ndid not make.

The Trial      Court    Rewrote   The    Rounding\n                      Provision.\n\n     Similarly, the trial court rewrote the rounding provision of the Fee\n\nAgreement. The trial court declared that “the rounding up to the next\n\nwhole percentage that is required by the Fee Agreement occurs after\n\nthe hours ratio is determined [and] before, not after, the hours ratio is\n\nmultiplied by 20%.” 1 CR 1303 ¶ 4. The trial court expressed its view\n\nof the rounding provision algebraically as follows:\n\n     Greenberg Peden Hours/McConn Williams Hours = X\n     (rounded up to the next whole percentage) (X1). X1 x 20% =\n     X2.\n\n     ***\n     277 Hours/11,652 Hours = 2.37% (rounded to 3%). 3% x 20%\n     = .006%. .006 x $51,000,000.00 = $306,000.00\n\n1 CR 525.\n\n\n\n\n                                    33\n\f              However, this rewritten rounding provision does not comport with\n\nthe Fee Agreement’s plain language. This is readily apparent because,\n\nutilizing the figures in the Fee Agreement’s rounding example and\n\napplying the trial court’s holding that any rounding to the next whole\n\npercentage occurs before the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%, the fee\n\nowed is 1.8%, not the 2% set forth in the example.19 Since the fee owed\n\nafter applying the trial court’s holding to the figures in the example\n\n(1.8%) does not match the fee owed in the example (2%), the trial court’s\n\nholding cannot be correct.\n\n              On the other hand, utilizing the figures in the example and\n\napplying Swonke’s interpretation that rounding to the next whole\n\npercentage occurs after the hours ratio is multiplied by 20%, the fee\n\nowed is 2%, precisely that fee set forth in the example.20 Consequently,\n\nSwonke’s interpretation is correct and is necessarily the agreement that\n\nSwonke and Anglo-Dutch made in the Fee Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n1990/1,000 = .09 = 9%. Because 9% is a whole percentage, no rounding up occurs.\n9% x 20% = 1.8%.\n\n20 90/1,000 = .09.                              .09 x 20% = 1.8% = 2% when rounded to the next whole\npercentage.\n\n                                                                34\n\f                             3.

The Supreme Court applied\n\nthis standard first to the text of the Fee Agreement and then to the\n\nsurrounding circumstances. See id. at 449, 452-53.\n\n                                            a.            A    Reasonable  Person   In   Anglo-Dutch’s\n                                                          Circumstances Would Have Recognized That The\n                                                          Numerator Is Swonke’s Hours, Not Greenberg\n                                                          Peden’s Hours.\n\n                                                          i.   The Text Of The Fee Agreement Plainly\n                                                               States That The Numerator Of The Hours\n                                                               Ratio Is Swonke’s Hours.\n\n              As previously noted, the text of the Fee Agreement, which Anglo-\n\nDutch proposed,21 twice refers to the numerator in the hours ratio as\n\nSwonke’s                      hours,                 without      any    location-dependent   limitation   or\n\n                                                            \n21See Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 452 (“Van Dyke was not an\nunsophisticated client; indeed, it was he, not Swonke, who proposed the terms of the\nFee Agreement.”).\n\n\n\n                                                                        35\n\frestriction on those hours.    And, as previously noted, the Supreme\n\nCourt has already construed this language to mean that the fee\n\ncalculation was based solely on Swonke’s individual hours because it\n\nprovided a way of limiting Anglo-Dutch’s fee.         See Anglo-Dutch\n\nPetroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 452 (emphasis added).           Thus, a\n\nreasonable   person   in    Anglo-Dutch’s   circumstances   would    have\n\nrecognized from the text of the Fee Agreement that the numerator of\n\nthe hours ratio is Swonke’s hours.\n\n                      ii.   The     Circumstances     Surrounding The\n                            Execution Of The Fee Agreement Do Not\n                            Alter Its Plain Language.\n\n     In the words of the Texas Supreme Court, “the circumstances in\n\nwhich the Fee Agreement was executed do not suggest that the parties\n\nmust have intended something different from what they plainly stated.”\n\nId. at 453. The Fee Agreement resulted from Anglo-Dutch’s desire to\n\nhave Swonke’s—not Greenberg Peden’s—assistance in the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit:\n\n     But Swonke’s continued counsel, based on his involvement in\n     the events leading up to the litigation, was still needed and\n     Van Dyke asked him to assist McConn & Williams, again for\n     a contingent fee.\n\n\n\n\n                                     36\n\fAnglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 447. And Greenberg Peden,\n\nto whom Swonke had presented the potential representation in\n\ncompliance with his of counsel arrangement, had declined to represent\n\nAnglo-Dutch in the Halliburton Lawsuit because Anglo-Dutch had not\n\npaid its outstanding bills to Greenberg Peden. Id.\n\n     Under these circumstances, when Anglo-Dutch sought Swonke’s\n\nhelp and Greenberg Peden had refused to represent Anglo-Dutch in the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit, it would be utterly illogical to construe the\n\npersonal pronouns defining the hours ratio as referring to anyone other\n\nthan Swonke. The circumstances surrounding the execution of the Fee\n\nAgreement certainly “do not suggest that the parties must have\n\nintended something different from what they plainly stated.” Id. at 453.\n\n                      iii. The Post-Fee Agreement Circumstances Do\n                           Not Alter The Plain Language Of The Fee\n                           Agreement.\n\n     Again in the words of the Supreme Court, “[e]vents following the\n\nFee Agreement do not cast the situation in a different light.” Id. at 453.\n\nWhen Swonke relocated from Greenberg Peden to McConn & Williams,\n\nSwonke informed Anglo-Dutch that Greenberg Peden was going to\n\ndissolve and that, absent objection (which was never made), he would\n\n\n\n                                   37\n\fcontinue    to   represent   Anglo-Dutch   in   matters,   including   the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit, in his new position as of counsel to McConn &\n\nWilliams:\n\n     But a year later, Greenberg Peden dissolved, and Swonke\n     moved to McConn & Williams, again in an “of counsel”\n     relationship. In a letter to Van Dyke, Swonke wrote that he\n     would not take the Anglo-Dutch files with him if Van Dyke\n     objected. Van Dyke did not.\n\nAnglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 448-49; 1 CR 193-194, 354.\n\n     At this point in time, Anglo-Dutch could have limited the fees\n\nowed under the Fee Agreement to the hours Swonke spent on the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to Greenberg Peden, as it now\n\nattempts to do, by requiring that the file stay at Greenberg Peden and\n\nnot allowing Swonke to take it with him to his of counsel position at\n\nMcConn & Williams. But Anglo-Dutch chose to continue working with\n\nSwonke because it needed his help. Because Anglo-Dutch’s decision to\n\npermit Swonke to take the Halliburton Lawsuit file with him to his of\n\ncounsel position at McConn & Williams without objection created the\n\nsituation about which it now complains, Anglo-Dutch’s complaint about\n\ncompensating Swonke for the time he worked on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit while there must fall on deaf ears.\n\n\n\n                                   38\n\f     With Anglo-Dutch’s knowledge, Swonke worked 1,022 hours on\n\nthe Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel at McConn & Williams. See 1\n\nCR 206. Included in those hours was time Swonke spent attending Van\n\nDyke’s three-day deposition, which occurred six months after Swonke\n\nrelocated from Greenberg Peden to McConn & Williams. 1 CR 206. In\n\nhis deposition, Van Dyke testified in the present tense that he had a fee\n\nagreement with Swonke, and noted through his testimony that his fee\n\nagreement with Swonke was separate and distinct from his other\n\nattorneys’ fee agreements:\n\n     Q:         The attorney’s fees, the written contract that you\n                made reference to a moment ago?\n\n     Van Dyke: Yes.\n\n     ***\n\n     Q:         Who is it with?\n\n     Van Dyke: It is with – there’s actually – there are two\n               contracts in existence, one is with a contract with\n               Mr. O’Quinn, Mr. McConn and Mr. Williams, and\n               the second contract is with Mr. Swonke.\n\n1 CR 247.\n\n     Finally, Swonke received no fees from McConn & Williams or any\n\nother source for any of the hours he spent on the Halliburton Lawsuit,\n\n\n\n                                   39\n\fincluding the 1,022 hours that he spent on the Halliburton Lawsuit\n\nafter relocating from Greenberg Peden to McConn & Williams. 1 CR\n\n206.\n\n       The post-Fee Agreement circumstances reflect that Swonke\n\nworked on the Halliburton Lawsuit for more than one thousand hours\n\nafter relocating from Greenberg Peden to McConn & Williams with the\n\nexpectation to be paid under the Fee Agreement by Anglo-Dutch, which\n\nknew both that Swonke was actively working on the Halliburton\n\nLawsuit and that the Fee Agreement, the numerator in which is based\n\non Swonke’s unrestricted and unlimited hours, was still in full force and\n\neffect. These post-Fee Agreement circumstances only bolster Swonke\n\nand the Supreme Court’s interpretation that the numerator in the\n\nhours ratio is Swonke’s hours.

Sacks, P.C., 266 S.W.3d at 450-51 (enforcing\n\nthe plain language of an unambiguous attorneys’ fee agreement and\n\nrefusing to impose a limitation on fees not expressed in the agreement).\n\n       Based on its text and the surrounding circumstances, a reasonable\n\nperson in Anglo-Dutch’s circumstances would have recognized that the\n\nnumerator in the hours ratio is Swonke’s hours.\n\n\n\n                                   40\n\f                b.   A    Reasonable    Person    In   Anglo-Dutch’s\n                     Circumstances Would Have Recognized That The\n                     Rounding To The Next Whole Percentage Occurs\n                     After, Not Before, Multiplying The Hours Ratio\n                     By 20%.\n\n                     i.   The Text Of The Fee Agreement Plainly\n                          Shows That The Rounding Occurs After, Not\n                          Before, Multiplying The Hours Ratio By 20%.\n\n     As previously noted, the text of the Fee Agreement plainly states\n\nthat the fee is a proportion of 20%, rounded up to the next whole\n\npercentage.   And, as previously stated, Anglo-Dutch’s method of\n\nrounding does not comport with the Fee Agreement’s plain language\n\nbecause Anglo-Dutch’s method produces an answer different than that\n\nin the Fee Agreement’s example.        Anglo-Dutch’s rounding method\n\nproduces an answer of 1.8% for the example while the Fee Agreement\n\nplainly shows that proper rounding results in an answer of 2% for the\n\nexample. Thus, a reasonable person in Anglo-Dutch’s circumstances\n\nwould have recognized from the text of the Fee Agreement that the\n\nrounding up to the next whole percentage occurs after, not before,\n\nmultiplying the hours ratio by 20%.\n\n\n\n\n                                  41\n\f                        ii.   Neither The Circumstances Surrounding The\n                              Execution Of The Fee Agreement Nor Post-\n                              Fee Agreement Circumstances Alter Its Plain\n                              Language That Requires Rounding After\n                              Multiplying The Hours Ratio By 20%.\n\n     Swonke and Van Dyke discussed the rounding feature before the\n\nFee Agreement was signed and it was clear that Van Dyke understood\n\nthe rounding feature as Swonke did. 9 RR 247-48. Van Dyke never\n\nsuggested during this discussion that the rounding would occur before\n\nthe hours ratio was multiplied by 20%. 9 RR 249. Anglo-Dutch first\n\nasserted that the rounding should occur before the hours ratio was\n\nmultiplied by 20% once the lawsuit was filed. Id. Consequently, “the\n\ncircumstances in which the Fee Agreement was executed do not suggest\n\nthat the parties must have intended something different from what\n\nthey plainly stated” regarding when rounding occurs. See Anglo-Dutch\n\nPetroleum Int’l, 352 S.W.3d at 453.\n\n     C.    Conclusion\n\n     As explained above, the trial court erred by rendering judgment\n\non Anglo-Dutch’s requested numerator and rounding declarations\n\nbecause Anglo-Dutch waived any entitlement to the declarations and, in\n\nany event, the declarations misconstrue the Fee Agreement by\n\n\n\n                                      42\n\frewriting its plain language in violation of the Supreme Court’s opinion.\n\nThese mistakes resulted in the rendition of an incorrect judgment for\n\nSwonke of $306,000 based on the parties’ stipulated facts.\n\n        Applying the trial court’s erroneous rounding declaration, but\n\nchanging its numerator declaration to include in the numerator all of\n\nthe hours Swonke worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit without\n\nlimitation or restriction, results in a fee owed under the Fee Agreement\n\nof $1,224,000, calculated as follows:\n\n    (1,299/11,652) = .11148301 = 11.148301% = 12% rounded up to the next\n                              whole percentage\n\n                              12% x 20% = 2.4%\n\n                       2.4% x $51,000,000 = $1,224,000\n\n        Applying the trial court’s numerator declaration, but changing its\n\nrounding declaration by rounding up to the next whole percentage after\n\nthe hours ratio is multiplied by 20%, results in a fee owed of $510,000,\n\ncalculated as follows:\n\n      (277/11,652) x 20% = .475455% = 1% when rounded up to the next\n                              whole percentage\n\n                         1% x $51,000,000 = $510,000\n\n\n\n\n                                     43\n\f        Changing both the trial court’s erroneous numerator and rounding\n\ndeclarations by including all of Swonke’s hours in the numerator and\n\nrounding to the next whole percentage after the hours ratio is\n\nmultiplied by 20%, results in a fee owed of $1,530,000, calculated as\n\nfollows:\n\n                         1,299/11,652 = .11148301\n\n    .11148301 x 20% = 2.22966% = 3% when rounded up to the next whole\n                               percentage\n\n                      3% x $51,000,000 = $1,530,000\n\n        Based on the parties’ stipulated facts, the amount owed under the\n\nFee Agreement when properly construed is $1,530,000. The trial court\n\nerred by refusing to render judgment for Swonke in that amount.\n\nII.     The Trial Court Erred By Rendering Judgment Against—And\n        Refusing To Render Judgment For—Swonke On His Attorneys’\n        Fees Claims.\n\n        The trial court’s 2007 Judgment ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay to\n\nSwonke attorneys’ fees of $352,892.50 for representation in the trial\n\ncourt and $75,000 for representation in the court of appeals. See 1 CR\n\nsupp 121. The trial court found those attorneys’ fees to be reasonable,\n\nnecessary, equitable, and just for the prosecution of Swonke’s breach of\n\n\n\n\n                                    44\n\fcontract and declaratory judgment claims, and Swonke’s defense of\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s declaratory judgment claims. Id.\n\n     As Anglo-Dutch has previously conceded, Anglo-Dutch did not\n\nappeal Swonke’s attorneys’ fees award: “Anglo-Dutch did not raise a\n\nseparate and distinct appeal point concerning the award of attorneys’\n\nfees to Swonke.” See 1 CR SUPP 394; Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc.\n\nv.

See 1 CR SUPP 281-282. Anglo-Dutch argued that\n\nSwonke did not prevail on his breach of contract claim because the\n\nTexas Supreme Court ruled that the Fee Agreement was between\n\nAnglo-Dutch and Greenberg Peden, not Swonke. See 1 CR SUPP 282.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch sought summary judgment on Swonke’s claim for\n\nattorneys’ fees under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section\n\n37.009 on three grounds: (1) Swonke’s declaratory judgment claim\n\nraised only issues already raised by Anglo-Dutch’s original claim; (2)\n\nSwonke did not prevail on his breach of contract claim; and (3) it would\n\nnot be equitable or just to award attorneys’ fees to Swonke. See 1 CR\n\nSUPP 282-284.\n\n     As shown below, none of Anglo-Dutch’s arguments support the\n\ntrial court’s summary judgment against Swonke on his attorneys’ fees\n\nclaims because: (1) Anglo-Dutch waived all complaints about Swonke’s\n\nattorneys’ fees award; (2) notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s opinion,\n\n\n                                  46\n\fSwonke had standing and capacity to sue for breach of the Fee\n\nAgreement; (3) Swonke may recover Declaratory Judgment Act\n\nattorneys’ fees defending against against declaratory judgment claims;\n\nand (4) Swonke’s award of attorneys’ fees was equitable and just and\n\nAnglo-Dutch waived any complaint that it was not.\n\n          1.

Consequently, Anglo-Dutch was not\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Swonke’s breach of contract claim.\n\n      Second, the summary judgment evidence affirmatively showed\n\nthat Swonke had capacity and standing to sue for breach of the Fee\n\nAgreement as an assignee and a third-party beneficiary of the Fee\n\nAgreement.      On April 16, 2004, before this lawsuit was ever filed,\n\nGreenberg Peden assigned all of its interest in and under the Fee\n\nAgreement to Swonke. See 2 CR SUPP 723.

App.—Corpus Christi\n\n2006, pet. denied), but Montemayor itself defeats Anglo-Dutch’s\n\nargument. In Montemayor, the court of appeals held that the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion by awarding attorneys’ fees to a defendant\n\nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act because the plaintiff’s original\n\nclaim was for a declaratory judgment. See Montemayor, 208 S.W.3d at\n\n666-67. Indeed, Montemayor expressly states that the rule upon which\n\nAnglo-Dutch relied “does not apply where a defendant is defending\n\nagainst a plaintiff's declaratory judgment action.” Id.\n\n     Here, Anglo-Dutch originally brought declaratory judgment claims\n\nand Swonke defended against them. See 1 CR SUPP 300; 1 CR SUPP\n\n392 (“Anglo-Dutch filed suit against Greenberg Peden, P.C. . . . and\n\nSwonke, seeking relief pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Act . . . .”).\n\nConsequently, Swonke was entitled to recover attorneys’ fees under the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act.

Swonke’s Breach Of Contract Claim Did Not\n                            Fail.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch also argued that Swonke could not recover attorneys’\n\nfees under the Declaratory Judgment Act because Swonke’s breach of\n\n\n                                    54\n\fcontract claim purportedly failed due to the Texas Supreme Court’s\n\nholding that Swonke was not a party to the Fee Agreement. See 1 CR\n\nSUPP 283. However, for the reasons set forth in section II.A.2.a. above,\n\nwhich are incorporated herein by reference, Anglo-Dutch’s argument\n\nthat Swonke did not prevail on his breach of contract claim lacks merit.\n\n                      iii. Anglo-Dutch Waived Its Complaint That\n                           Swonke’s Attorneys’ Fee Award Was Not\n                           Equitable And Just And, In Any Event, The\n                           Award Was Equitable And Just.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch finally argued that Swonke could not recover\n\nattorneys’ fees under the Declaratory Judgment Act because it would\n\nnot be equitable and just to award attorneys’ fees to Swonke. See 1 CR\n\nSUPP 283-284. In its 2007 Judgment, the trial court expressly found\n\nthat Swonke’s award of attorneys’ fees was equitable and just. See 1\n\nCR 299.   But Anglo-Dutch did not attack that conclusion of law on\n\nappeal. See 1 CR SUPP 394 (“Anglo-Dutch did not raise a separate and\n\ndistinct appeal point concerning the award of attorneys’ fees to\n\nSwonke.”); Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int’l, Inc. v.

Thus,\n\nAnglo-Dutch’s attack on the equitable and just nature of Swonke’s\n\nattorneys’ fees award has been waived and could not have been properly\n\nrevisited on remand by the trial court.\n\n     In any event, it was equitable and just to award attorneys’ fees to\n\nSwonke under the Declaratory Judgment Act given the circumstances\n\nof this case. Swonke has thus far defeated three of Anglo-Dutch’s seven\n\ndeclaratory judgment claims and, when this Court reverses the trial\n\ncourt’s numerator and rounding declarations, Anglo-Dutch will have\n\nsucceeded on only two of seven requested declarations. And neither of\n\nthose declarations are significant to the ultimate issue in this case—\n\nwhat does Anglo-Dutch owe Swonke under the Fee Agreement? The\n\ndeclaration that Greenberg Peden is a party to the Fee Agreement is of\n\nno moment because, as explained above, it is not dispositive of Swonke’s\n\nbreach of contract claim.    The declaration that Swonke’s hours at\n\nMcConn & Williams are included in the denominator in the fee formula\n\nis insignificant and was agreed to by Swonke because it does not change\n\nthe fee owed to Swonke under the Fee Agreement. 1 CR 460.\n\n\n\n                                   56\n\f     Moreover, the facts contained in the Statement of Facts in this\n\nbrief, which are incorporated herein by reference, also demonstrate that\n\nit was equitable and just to award Swonke attorneys’ fees for his\n\ndefense of Anglo-Dutch’s declaratory judgment claims. Specifically, Van\n\nDyke’s company, Anglo-Dutch, settled the Halliburton Lawsuit for\n\n$51,000,000 and then stiffed Swonke on his fee. Anglo-Dutch then sued\n\nSwonke for a judicial declaration that it owed him nothing for the 1,022\n\nhours he had worked on the lawsuit while at McConn & Williams even\n\nthough:\n\n           Greenberg Peden had expressly refused to represent Anglo-\n            Dutch in the Halliburton Lawsuit and told Van Dyke so;\n\n           Van Dyke, not Swonke, proposed the disputed terms in the\n            Fee Agreement;\n\n           Greenberg Peden is not mentioned in the body of the Fee\n            Agreement;\n\n           The Fee Agreement uses personal pronouns twelve times in\n            nine sentences to refer to Swonke;\n\n           Van Dyke himself testified in the Halliburton Lawsuit that\n            Anglo-Dutch had a fee agreement with Swonke;\n\n           Swonke worked 1,022 hours on the Halliburton Lawsuit\n            without compensation while “of counsel” at McConn &\n            Williams because he knew he would be compensated under\n            the Fee Agreement with Anglo-Dutch;\n\n\n\n                                   57\n\f           Although Anglo-Dutch seeks to avoid paying Swonke\n            attorneys’ fees for the 1,022 hours he worked on the\n            Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams,\n            Anglo-Dutch’s verdict that resulted in the $51,000,000\n            settlement actually included attorneys’ fees for those same\n            hours;\n\n           After settling the Halliburton Lawsuit for $51,000,000,\n            Anglo-Dutch began a concerted effort to avoid its contractual\n            obligations to numerous others who helped it prevail; and\n\n           Swonke has not been compensated by anyone for any of his\n            1,299 hours of work on the Halliburton Lawsuit that helped\n            Anglo-Dutch recover $51,000,000.\n\nThese facts demonstrate that an award of attorneys’ fees to Swonke is\n\nequitable and just.

See id. On motion for rehearing, the\n\nlosing party argued that it had prevailed on several other issues in the\n\ncourt of appeals which were unchallenged—and therefore waived—in\n\nthe Supreme Court. See id. The Supreme Court agreed that those\n\nissues were waived and held that “the court of appeals’ judgment\n\nremains in effect as to these abandoned issues.” Id. In Bramlett, the\n\ncourt of appeals succinctly stated the rule:\n\n\n\n                                    59\n\f      [A]s to issues not addressed by the Supreme Court, the\n      opinions and judgments of this Court [of Appeals] remain in\n      force and effect.

In\n\nPhillips, the Supreme Court held that the portion of a court of appeals’\n\njudgment that reversed punitive damages was not reversed—but\n\ninstead was “approved”—in the Supreme Court, even though the\n\nSupreme Court’s opinion, judgment, and mandate stated that the court\n\nof   appeals’   judgment   was   reversed,   because   that   issue   went\n\nunchallenged in the Supreme Court and unaddressed in its opinion.\n\nSee id. at 233, 237.

See Guitar Holding Co., 263 S.W.3d at 918; Bramlett,\n\n359 S.W.3d at 311.\n\n     In Phillips, the Texas Supreme Court concluded that, “[b]y\n\nremanding the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment consistent\n\nwith our opinion, we permitted the trial court to enter a final judgment\n\nthat reflected this [Supreme] Court’s holdings and the court of appeals’\n\nholding . . . .” Phillips, 407 S.W.3d at 237 (emphasis added). Like\n\nPhillips, by remanding this case to the trial court for entry of a\n\njudgment in accordance with its opinion, the Supreme Court in this case\n\npermitted the trial court to render a final judgment that reflected the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding—that Greenberg Peden was unambiguously a\n\nparty to the Fee Agreement—and the prior decisions of the trial court\n\nand this Court that were waived on appeal, including the trial court’s\n\naward of $427,892.50 to Swonke on his attorneys’ fee claims. See id.\n\nThe trial court’s refusal to render such a judgment for Swonke on his\n\nattorneys’ fees claims was error.\n\n\n\n                                    61\n\fIII.   The Trial Court Erred By Rendering Judgment Against—And\n       Refusing To Render Judgment For—Swonke On His Breach Of\n       Contract Claim.\n\n       A.   The Trial Court Erred By Granting Summary Judgment To\n            Anglo-Dutch On Swonke’s Breach Of Contract Claim.\n\n       On remand, Anglo-Dutch sought summary judgment on Swonke’s\n\nbreach of contract claim on the sole ground that the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt had ruled that Swonke did not have a contract with Anglo-Dutch.\n\nSee 1 CR SUPP 280-281. The trial court granted Anglo-Dutch’s motion\n\nand ordered that Swonke take nothing on his breach of contract claim.\n\n1 CR 668.\n\n       However, for the reasons stated in detail in section II.A.2.a. above,\n\nwhich are incorporated herein by reference, Anglo-Dutch was not\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Swonke’s breach of contract claim\n\nbecause: Anglo-Dutch did not conclusively negate Swonke’s standing or\n\ncapacity to sue for breach of the Fee Agreement as an assignee or third-\n\nparty beneficiary; and the April 16, 2004 assignment from Greenberg\n\nPeden to Swonke of Greenberg Peden’s interest in the Fee Agreement\n\nraised a genuine issue of material fact about whether Swonke had\n\nstanding and capacity to sue for breach of the Fee Agreement as an\n\nassignee or third-party beneficiary. For those reasons, the trial court\n\n\n                                     62\n\ferred by granting summary judgment to Anglo-Dutch on Swonke’s\n\nbreach of contract claim.\n\n     B.    Alternatively, The Trial Court Erred By Refusing To Render\n           Judgment For Swonke On His Breach Of Contract Claim.\n\n     As explained above, the trial court erred by misconstruing the Fee\n\nAgreement and refusing to render judgment that Anglo-Dutch owes\n\nSwonke $1,530,000 under the Fee Agreement. In the alternative to that\n\nrecovery, the trial court erred by refusing to render judgment for\n\nSwonke on his breach of contract claim.\n\n     Swonke moved the trial court to render judgment for him on his\n\nbreach of contract claim. 3 CR SUPP 1014. The trial court denied\n\nSwonke’s request and rendered a take-nothing judgment against\n\nSwonke on his breach of contract claim. 1 CR 1304. As shown below,\n\nthe trial court erred by refusing to render judgment for Swonke on his\n\nbreach of contract claim because conclusive evidence and undisturbed\n\njury findings from the original trial entitle Swonke to the rendition of a\n\njudgment for $1,000,000 on his breach of contract claim.\n\n     Swonke sued Anglo-Dutch for breach of the Fee Agreement. 1 CR\n\nSUPP 294-307. The elements of a breach of contract claim are: “(1) the\n\nexistence of a valid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance\n\n\n                                   63\n\fby the plaintiff; (3) breach of contract by the defendant; and (4)\n\ndamages sustained as a result of the breach.” Sims v.

On April\n\n16, 2004, before this lawsuit was ever filed, Greenberg Peden assigned\n\n\n\n                                   64\n\fall of its interest in and under the Fee Agreement to Swonke. See 1 CR\n\n385 (“Greenberg Peden, P.C. hereby . . . ASSIGNS all of its interest in\n\nand under the [Fee Agreement] to Swonke.”); [additional cite]. Indeed,\n\nthe trial court recognized the validity of that assignment as a matter of\n\nlaw in its May 15, 2012 Order: “[U]nder the Fee Agreement the Court\n\ndetermines that the attorneys’ fees due to Greenberg Peden (and now\n\nSwonke by way of assignment) are $306,000.” (emphasis added). That\n\nassignment also identifies Swonke as the “third party beneficiary” of\n\nthe Fee Agreement.     See id. For these reasons, the April 16, 2004\n\nassignment conclusively proves that Swonke had standing and capacity\n\nto sue for breach of the Fee Agreement.\n\n     The second element of Swonke’s breach of contract claim—\n\nperformance by the plaintiff—is also undisputed and conclusively\n\nproved. Swonke promised in the Fee Agreement “to assist Anglo-Dutch\n\nand that firm [McConn & Williams, LLP] in this lawsuit [the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit] . . . .” The evidence at trial conclusively proved\n\nthat Swonke assisted Anglo-Dutch and McConn & Williams in the\n\nHalliburton Lawsuit, by working on the lawsuit for 277 hours while of\n\ncounsel to Greenberg Peden and 1,022 hours while of counsel at\n\n\n\n                                   65\n\fMcConn & Williams. 1 CR 164, 184, 206, 216. Indeed, the trial court\n\nrecognized in its May 15, 2012 order that Anglo-Dutch had conceded\n\nthat Swonke assisted Anglo-Dutch on the Halliburton Lawsuit for 277\n\nhours while at Greenberg Peden (“In addition, the parties have agreed\n\nthat Swonke spent 277 hours on the representation while at Greenberg\n\nPeden . . . .”).22 For these reasons, Swonke’s performance of the Fee\n\nAgreement has been conclusively proved.\n\n              The third element of Swonke’s breach of contract claim—Anglo-\n\nDutch’s breach of the Fee Agreement—was proved in the original trial.\n\nThe jury found in response to Question 2 that Anglo-Dutch failed to\n\ncomply with the Fee Agreement.                                      1 CR 304.

P. 301 (“The judgment of the\n\ncourt shall conform to the pleadings, the nature of the case proved and\n\n\n\n\n                                   68\n\fthe verdict, if any, and shall be so framed as to give the party all the\n\nrelief to which he may be entitled either in law or equity.”).\n\nIV.   The Trial Court Erred By Rendering A Judgment On Prejudgment\n      Interest, Post-Judgment Interest, And Costs That Conflicts With\n      Its 2007 Judgment, Which Remains In Force And Effect On Those\n      Issues.\n\n      A.   Anglo-Dutch Waived Any Complaints About The Trial\n           Court’s 2007 Judgment On Prejudgment Interest, Post-\n           Judgment Interest, And Costs.\n\n      The trial court has ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay Swonke\n\n$42,127.40 in prejudgment interest. See 1 CR 1304 at ¶ 13. However,\n\nthe trial court’s 2007 Judgment awarded Swonke $226,924.50 in\n\nprejudgment interest. 1 CR 299. Anglo-Dutch did not complain about\n\nthe trial court’s award of $226,924.50 in prejudgment interest in its\n\nappeal to this Court or the Texas Supreme Court. 1 CR SUPP 124-183,\n\n185-214, 216-269.\n\n      The trial court has also ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay Swonke post-\n\njudgment interest on $348,127.40. See 1 CR 1305 at ¶ 16. However,\n\nthe trial court’s 2007 Judgment ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay Swonke\n\npost-judgment interest on “this judgment and the amounts awarded\n\nherein,” i.e., $1,654,817. 1 CR 300. Anglo-Dutch did not complain in its\n\nappeal to this Court or the Texas Supreme Court about the trial court’s\n\n\n                                    69\n\forder to pay Swonke post-judgment interest on the 2007 Judgment and\n\nthe $1,654,817 awarded therein. 1 CR SUPP 124-183, 185-214, 216-\n\n269.\n\n       Finally, the trial court also ordered Swonke and Greenberg Peden\n\nto pay all court costs. See 1 CR 1304 at ¶ 15. However, the trial court’s\n\n2007 Judgment ordered Anglo-Dutch to pay all court costs. 1 CR 299.\n\nAnglo-Dutch did not complain about the trial court’s order to pay all\n\ncourt costs in its appeal to this Court or the Texas Supreme Court. 1\n\nCR SUPP 124-183, 185-214, 216-269.\n\n       Anglo-Dutch’s failure to complain on appeal about the 2007\n\nJudgment’s orders to pay $226,924.50 in prejudgment interest, post-\n\njudgment interest on $1,654,817, and costs waived any complaints\n\nabout those awards.

The 2007 Judgment’s Awards Of Prejudgment Interest,\n           Post-judgment Interest, And Costs Remain In Force And\n           Effect.\n\n     As previously noted, a lower court’s judgment remains in force and\n\neffect as to any issue it decides that is not appealed.      See Guitar\n\nHolding Co., L.P., 263 S.W.3d at 918; Bramlett, 359 S.W.3d at 311. And\n\na lower court’s judgment remains controlling on issues it decided that\n\nwere waived on appeal even when that judgment is “reversed” by a\n\nhigher court. See Phillips, 407 S.W.3d at 233, 237 (Tex. 2013); Guitar\n\nHolding Co., L.P., 263 S.W.3d at 918. Because Anglo-Dutch did not\n\nappeal to any court the 2007 Judgment’s awards of prejudgment\n\ninterest, post-judgment interest, or costs, those awards remain in force\n\nand effect. See Guitar Holding Co., 263 S.W.3d at 918; Bramlett, 359\n\nS.W.3d at 311.\n\n\n\n\n                                   71\n\f     C.   The Trial Court Erred By Altering Its Prior Awards Of\n          Prejudgment Interest, Post-judgment Interest, And Costs,\n          And Refusing To Render Judgment Consistent With Its 2007\n          Judgment.\n\n     Anglo-Dutch’s waiver of all complaints about the 2007 Judgment’s\n\nawards of prejudgment interest, post-judgment interest, and costs\n\nprohibited the trial court from altering those awards on remand\n\nbecause a trial court errs by rendering a judgment on remand that\n\nalters its own or a higher court’s prior judgment on an issue that was\n\nnot appealed. See Medical Ctr. Pharmacy, 634 F.3d at 834 (holding\n\nthat the district court erred by reversing on remand its prior ruling\n\ngranting declaratory relief which had been waived on appeal); United\n\nResources, L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3339537</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (holding that the trial court\n\nerred on remand by modifying its prior take-nothing judgment on cross-\n\nclaims because no party had attacked that part of the trial court’s\n\njudgment in an earlier appeal); Hudspeth County Underground Water\n\nConservation Dist. No. 1, 355 S.W.3d at 434-35 (holding that the trial\n\ncourt erred on remand by making a finding on prevailing-party status\n\nfor attorneys’ fees purposes that conflicted with the court of appeals’\n\nprior decision on the issue which had been waived on appeal to the\n\nTexas Supreme Court); JGR, Inc., 550 F.3d at 533 (holding that a\n\n\n                                  72\n\fdistrict court erred on remand by rendering judgment on a jury’s $3.3\n\nmillion lost profits finding because the district court’s previously-\n\nrendered judgment on a $0 lost profits finding had been waived on\n\nappeal); Anderson Courier Serv., 222 S.W.3d at 66-67 (holding that the\n\ntrial court erred by awarding attorneys’ fees under the declaratory\n\njudgment act on remand when any complaint that the trial court’s\n\noriginal judgment failed to award attorneys’ fees was waived on appeal).\n\nTherefore, the trial court erred by rendering a judgment inconsistent\n\nwith the 2007 Judgment’s awards of $226,924.50 in prejudgment\n\ninterest, post-judgment interest on $1,654,817, and costs, and refusing\n\nto render a judgment consistent with the 2007 Judgment on those\n\nissues.\n\n                                PRAYER\n\n     For these reasons, Swonke requests that this Court reverse the\n\ntrial court’s 2014 Judgment decrees 2(1), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15,\n\nand 16. Swonke also requests that this Court render judgment that\n\nAnglo-Dutch pay Swonke $1,530,000 under the Fee Agreement,\n\n$427,892.50 in attorneys’ fees, $226,924.50 in prejudgment interest,\n\n\n\n\n                                    73\n\fpost-judgment interest on $1,654,817, and court costs.

You may render your verdict upon the vote of ten or more members of the\n   jury. The same ten or more of you must agree upon all of the answers made and to\n    the entire verdict You will not, therefore, enter into an agreement to be bound by a.\n    majortty or any other vote of less than ten jurors. If the verdict and an of the answers\n    therein are reached by unanimous ?Qreement, the presiding juror shall sign the verdict\n    for the entire jury. If any juror disagrees as to any answer made by the verdict, those\n     jurors who agree to all findings shall each sign the verdict\n\n       These instructions are given you because your conduct is subject to review the\nsame as that of the witnesses, parties, attorneys am:j the judge.

On this issue the Court relies on the\n\nfollowing guidance:\n\n\n                (i)      October 16, 2000, Fee Agreement;\n\n                (ii)     Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int 'l, Inc. et al. v. Greenberg Peden, P. C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895367\"><a href=\"/opinion/895367/anglo-dutch-petroleum-v-greenberg-peden/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span>\n                         <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011).\n\n\nIn addition, the Court has reviewed the briefs and heard the oral arguments of the respective\n\nparties on this issue.\n\n        As to the threshold question, \"Who are the parties to the Fee Agreement?\" the Texas\n\nSupreme Court has unequivocally answered that question. The Supreme Court, after extensive\n\nbriefing and oral arguments, has stated the Fee Agreement was \"between Anglo-Dutch and\n\nGreenberg Peden.\" Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int'l, Inc., 352 S.W.3d at 453. As such, only\n\nSwanke's work while at Greenberg Peden is covered by the Fee Agreement.\n\n        From that starting point, the Court looks to the Fee Agreement to determine the\n\nappropriate formula for calculating the attorneys' fees. The Fee Agreement spells outs the\n\nfollowing:\n\n        I [Greenberg Peden] agree to assist Anglo-Dutch and that firm [McConn & Williams] in\n        this lawsuit [Cause No. 2000-22588; Anglo-Dutch (Fenge) eta!. v. Ramco et al., In the\n                                      RECORDER'S MEMORANDUM\n                                      This instrument is of poor quality                                     524\n                                            at the time of imaging\n\f        I 51st Judicial District Court ofHarris County, Texas] for proportionately the same\n        percentage (20%) of any benefit to McConn & Williams reflected in such agreement.\n        However, I will not be responsible for any expenses other than those I may personally\n        incur. Further, the proportions under which my fees shall be calculated will be the ratio of\n        the hours I have spent or will spend on this matter relative to the hours the attorneys at\n        McConn & Williams have spent or will spend after the date the lawsuit was filed,\n        rounded to the next whole percentage.\n\nFee Agreement, page 1. [not in original]\n\nThe Court reads the above recitals to result in the following formula:\n\n        Greenberg Peden Hours/McCmm Williams Hours= X (rounded up to the next whole\n        percentage) (XI). Xl x 20% = X2.\n\nThe Fee Agreement goes on to say that the factor X2 will be applied to \"gross revenues and other\n\nbenefits received\" to determine the attorneys' fees.\n\n        We know \"gross revenues\" to be $51,000,000.00 which represents the amount of the\n\nnegotiated settlement. In addition, the parties have agreed that Swanke spent 277 hours on the\n\nrepresentation while at Greenberg Peden and that McConn Williams spent 11,652 on the\n\nrepresentation. Hence, the Court makes the following calculation under the guidance of the\n\nTexas Supreme Court, the Fee Agreement, and the undisputed evidence:\n\n                277 Hours/11,652 Hours= 2.37% (rounded to 3%). 3% x 20% = .006% .\n                .006 X $51,000,000.00 = $306,000.00\n\nThus, under the Fee Agreement the Court determines that the attorneys' fees due to Greenberg\n\nPeden (and now Swanke by way of assignment) are $306,000.00. This determination will be\n\napplied to and will be used to resolve all outstanding issues remaining in the above captioned\n\ncase.\n\n\n\n                      MAY 1 5 2012\n        Signed _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              525\n\fAPPENDIXF\n\f                                    CAUSE NO. 2004-20712\n\nANGLO-DUTCH PETROLEUM                            §     IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF\nINTERNATIONAL, INC. and                          §\nANGLO-DUTCH (TENGE), LLC,                        §\n                                                 §                                       ~          ~\n                                                                                              .... .!It\n       PLAINTIFFS,                               §                                             .m\n                                                                                         filil c- ~ =              I\n                                                                                                          =\n                                                                                                          C'o.J\n                                                 §                                              cuU\nv.                                               §        HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS           ~~~\n                                                 §                                       ........ .c.     ~\nGREENBERG PEDEN, P.C. and                        §                                       ,....us          2\nGERARD J.

All parties appeared and announced\n\nready for trial. A jury was impaneled and sworn; it heard the evidence and arguments of counsel.\n\nIn response to the Charge of the Court, the jury made findings that the Court received, filed, and\n\nentered of record on January 15, 2014. The questions submitted to the jury and the jury's\n\nfindings are attached as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference.\n\n                                                   Post-Trial\n\n       Swanke and Greenberg Peden moved the Court to rule as a matter of law that Anglo-\n\nDutch waived its trial, appellate, and post-remand attorneys' fees and costs claims. The Court\n\ndenied that motion. Swanke and Greenberg Peden also moved the Court to disregard the jury's\n\nfindings to Questions 2(2) and 4(B). The Court initially denied that motion, but upon\n\nreconsideration has agreed to that motion. Specifically, after considering the evidence introduced\n\nat trial, the jury's verdict, and the entire record, the Court finds that an award of attorneys' fees\n\nor costs to Anglo-Dutch would not be equitable or just.\n\n                                     RECORDER'S MEMORANDUM\n                                     Th1s mstrument IS of poor qualrty\n                                          at the t1me of 1magmg\n                                                                                                    1302\n\f       Anglo-Dutch moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Court denied that\n\nmotion.\n\n                                          Judgment Decrees\n\n          Based upon the Court's pretrial rulings, the jury's verdict, and the post-verdict arguments\n\nof counsel, the judgment should be and is now hereby RENDERED as set forth below:\n\n          1.     As requested in Plaintiffs' First Amended Petition at page 7,    ~   23(a), the Court\n\nDECLARES that the Fee Agreement is between Anglo-Dutch and Greenberg Peden, and not\n\nbetween Anglo-Dutch and Swanke individually.\n\n          2.     As requested in Plaintiffs' First Amended Petition at 7 ~ 23(c), the Court\n\nDECLARES that: (1) the numerator in the hours ratio in the fee formula in the Fee Agreement is\n\nthe hours Greenberg Peden worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit and does not include the hours\n\nSwanke worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams; and (2) the\n\nhours Swanke worked on the Halliburton Lawsuit while of counsel to McConn & Williams are\n\nincluded in the denominator in the fee fommla in the Fee Agreement.\n\n          3.

You may discus~ the case\n             with other jurors only when you are all together in the jury room.\n\n                   'Remember my previous instructions: Do not discuss the case with anyone\n                       l\n\n             else, either in person or by any other means. Do not do any independent\n             investigation about the case or conduct any research. Do not look up any words in\n             dictionaries or. on the Internet. Do not post information about the case on the\n             Internet. Do not share any special knowledge or experiences with the other jurors.\n             Do not use your phone or any other electronic device during your deliberations for\n             any reason. I will give you a number where others may contact you in case of an\n             emergency.\n\n                    Any notes you have taken are for your own personal use. You may take your\n             notes back into the jury room and consult them during deliberations, but do not show\n             or read your notes to your fellow jurors during your deliberations. Your notes are\n             not evidence. Each of you should rely on your independent recollection of the\n             evidence and not be influenced by the fact that another juror has or has not taken\n             notes.\n\n                    You must leave your notes with the bailiff when you are not deliberating. The\n             bailiff will give your notes to me promptly after collecting them from you. I will\n             make sure your notes are kept in a safe, secure location and not disclosed to anyone.\n             After you complete your deliberations, the bailiff will collect your notes. When you\n\n\n\n\n                                               EXHIBIT A\n                                                                                                1306\n\f       are reJeased from jury duty, the bailiff will promptly destroy your notes so that\n       nobody can read what you wrote.\n\n             Here are the instructions for answering the questions.\n\n                   1.     Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your\n                          decision.\n\n                   2.     Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on\n                          the law that is in these instructions and questions. Do not\n                          consider or discuss any evidence that was not admitted in the\n                          courtroom.\n\n                   3.     You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the\n                          sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to\n                          give their testimony. But on matters of Jaw, you must follow all\n                          of my instructions.\n\n                   4.     If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its\n                          ordinary meaning, use the meaning I give you, which will be a\n                          proper legal definition.\n\n                   5.     All the questions and answers are important. No one should say\n                          that any question or answer is not important.\n\n                    6.    Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all questions unless you are told\n                          otherwise. A \"yes\" answer must be based on a preponderance of\n                          the evidence unless you are told otherwise. Whenever a question\n                          requires an answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\" your answer must\n                          be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are told\n                          otherwise.\n\n                          The tenn \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater\n                          weight of credible evidence presented in this case. If you do not\n                          find that a preponderance of the evidence supports a \"yes\"\n....                      answer, then answer \"no.\" A preponderance of the evidence is\n<!)\n..0\nE\n                          not measured by the number of witnesses or by the number of\n:>\nz                         documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be proved by a\n                          preponderance of the evidence, you must find that the fact is\n                          more likely true than not true.\n                                             Page 2 of 12\n\n\n\n                                         EXHIBIT A\n                                                                                        1307\n\f                   7.     Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the\n                          questions and then just answer the questions to match your\n                          decision. Answer each question carefully without considering\n                          who will win. Do not discuss or consider the effect your answers\n                          will have.\n\n                   8.     Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of\n                          chance.\n\n                   9.     Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree\n                          in advance to decide on a dollar amount by adding up each\n                          juror's amount and then figuring the average.\n\n                    10.   Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say, \"I will\n                          answer this question your way if you answer another question\n                          my way.\"\n\n                    11.   Unless otherwise instructed, the answers to the questions must be\n                          based on the decision of at least ten of the twelve jurors. The\n                          same ten jurors must agree on every answer. Do not agree to be\n                          bound by a vote of anything less than ten jurors, even if it would\n                          be a majority.\n\n\n\n              As I have said before, if you do not follow these instructions, you will be\n       guilty of juror misconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this\n       process over again. This would waste your time and the parties' money, and would\n       require the taxpayers of this county to pay for another trial. If a juror breaks any of\n       these rules, tell that person to stop and report it to me immediately.\n\n\n\n\n5\nE\n;:l\n 0\n D\nQ\n\"'\n u\n<;:;\n                                             Page 3 of 12\n ...\n <I)\n\nu\n                                         EXHIBIT A\n                                                                                           1308\n\fQUESTION NO. 1:\n\n\n       What are the fees for the services of Anglo-Dutch Petroleum International,\nInc. and Anglo-Dutch (Tenge), LLC's attorneys, stated in dollars and cents?\n\n     You are instructed to include only fees for services that relate to Anglo-\nDutch Petroleum International, Inc. and Anglo-Dutch (Tenge), LLC's declaratory\njudgment claims.\n\n        You are further instructed that if any attorney's fees relate solely to a claim\nfor which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from\nunrecoverable fees.

Unless otherwise instructed, you may answer the questions on a\n           vote of ten jurors. The same ten jurors must agree on every answer in the\n           charge.
