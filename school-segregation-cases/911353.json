I can find\n\nno legal error in that court’s excellent memorandum opinion published at 88 F. Supp.2d 663,\n\nand produced after full briefing and a three-day hearing, and following more than three years\n\nof pretrial activity. I would affirm.\n\n  The fault is said to be the lack of predominance of the class-wide discriminatory pattern\n\nclaim over individual damage claims and the lack of superiority or efficiency of a class action\n\nproceeding over individual trials. The district court explained, at pages 680-83, why the claim\n\nof the 200 salaried black employees, a homogenous group who suffered similar damages from\n\nan employer’s alleged policy of intentional discrimination, predominated. And the court then\n\nexplained why the class action would be far superior to individual trials in fair and efficient\n\nadjudication, the latter path tying up the court for at least 200 weeks. One wonders where\n\nthese two circuit judges have acquired the expertise to fault this experienced trial judge on the\n\nmanagement of his trials. They concede that this decision is one for his discretion.\n\n  Actually, though purporting to recognize “the essentially factual basis of the certification\n\ninquiry,” the majority pays little attention to the factual particulars of the case and does not\n\naddress any erroneous finding in concluding that an abuse of discretion has been committed.\n\nThis opinion does much more than override a district court’s judgment in a specific case. It\n\ndoes indeed address an error of law, and that error is seen as the granting of certification of\n\fa class where its members seek individual damages. The Fifth Circuit rule of law, if this\n\nopinion stands, is that there can be no class action where the class members seek individual\n\npersonal damages beyond those incidental to a claim for equitable relief. The very same\n\nconsiderations and rule would apply whatever the nature of the common claim. In this\n\nrespect, Rule 23 applies to Title VII as amended in 1991 as it does to any other claim. That\n\nchanges Rule 23(b)(3) and departs from precedent as well as the advisory committee’s note\n\nwhich states that “(b)(3) encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve\n\neconomies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of decision as to persons\n\nsimilarly situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable\n\nresults.”39\n\n   Twenty-four years ago the Supreme Court prescribed a different rule and model for the\n\nclass action where the class claims a pattern or practice of discrimination. International\n\nBrotherhood of Teamsters v. United States.40 The trial proceeds in two or more stages. At\n\nthe first stage, the plaintiffs’ “burden is to demonstrate that unlawful discrimination has been\n\na regular procedure or policy followed by an employer or group of employers.”41 If the\n\nplaintiffs seek individual relief as victims of that practice, the case moves to the next stage to\n\ndetermine the consequences to the individual, where the class members are entitled to a\n\n\n\n\n    39\n         FED.

Citgo Petroleum Corp.,43 will, at this\n\ntime, be treated only as a Title VII exception to Rule 23. These opinions point to the 1991\n\namendment as radically changing, or forbidding, class actions in Title VII cases. That is an\n\ninexplicable position, because the amendment did nothing more than allow legal damages for\n\nclaimants; and that factor had been no bar to class actions in employment cases brought under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1981. But if this is Fifth Circuit law, only Title VII class actions for equitable\n\nrelief (including back pay) remain. However, if employees are barred from a Rule 23(b)(3)\n\nclass action to obtain legal damages, what is the consequence of and to a class action under\n\nRule 23(b)(2)? Would members of the class encounter an objection of splitting their damages\n\n(between back pay and consequential damages) in their individual actions?44 If so, they may\n\n   42\n      See id. at 362; see also Lee v.

This general principle extends to class actions. See Penson v. Terminal Transport Co.,\n634 F.2d 989, 994, 996 (5th Cir. 1981) (noting “the advent of the ‘hybrid’ Rule 23(b)(2) class action in which\nindividual monetary relief for class members, typically back pay, is sought in addition to classwide injunctive\nor declaratory relief,” and recognizing that “[a] judgment or consent decree entered in a class action can bind\nthe absent class member even though the member had filed a claim or instituted a personal suit before the\ndecision in the class action”). However, Rule 23(c)(4) provides that class actions may be limited to particular\n                                                                                                   (continued...)\n\n                                                      22\n\for may not choose to remain in the (b)(2) class. The notice provision of Rule 23(c)(2) does\n\nnot apply to a (b)(2) action, but surely these employees need to be informed of the problem.\n\nEven if there is no problem for the member of a (b)(2) class obtaining equitable relief and\n\nthen pursuing legal damages in an individual action, should the employees not be informed\n\nof the fact and limits of relief in the class action? This situation raises questions of\n\nnumerousness and commonality under Rule 23(a). If, after notice to the class members,\n\nsimultaneous individual suits for legal damages were allowed, perhaps the class action could\n\nproceed. That legal rigmarole might please my colleagues but certainly not the trial court and\n\nthose plaintiffs forced to endure the expense and delay of individual trials.\n\n  Moreover, Congress did not intend to foreclose the benefits of class action treatment to\n\ninjured parties by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The purposes of the Act were “first, to\n\nprovide monetary remedies for victims of intentional employment discrimination to\n\ncompensate them for resulting injuries and to provide more effective deterrence; and second,\n\nto respond to the Supreme Court’s recent decisions by restoring federal civil rights protections\n\n\n\n\n  44\n    (...continued)\nissues, and courts might recognize that individual suits for compensatory damages should not be barred by a\njudgment in a related class action, if the court hearing the class action concluded that compensatory damages\nwere not amenable to resolution in a class action, and chose to hear only claims for equitable relief. Cf. D-1\nEnters., Inc. v. Commercial State Bank, 864 F.2d 36, 38 (5th Cir. 1989) (“Essential to the application of the\ndoctrine of res judicata is the principle that the previously unlitigated claims to be precluded could and should\nhave been brought in the earlier litigation.”); Bogard v. Cook, 586 F.2d 399, 408-09 (5th Cir. 1978) (holding\nthat class action seeking equitable relief did not bar subsequent individual suit for damages where class action\nnotice did not alert class members to possibility that they could seek individual damages and inclusion of\nindividual damage claims would have made class action unmanageable).\n\n                                                      23\n\fagainst employment discrimination.”45\n\n   Note that the expansion of remedies in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to include\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages only applies to employers with more than fourteen\n\nemployees.46 The Act targets larger employers, yet our court interprets it to protect large\n\nemployers from the formidable plaintiffs’ tool of Rule 23. If one doubts that the class action\n\nis an important tool to plaintiffs seeking redress for employment discrimination, witness the\n\nrecent Coca-Cola settlement of an employee class action alleging race discrimination.47\n\nEarlier settlements of an employee class action suit against Texaco, which the present suit\n\nfollowed, and one against Mitsubishi, further attest to the value of the class action to plaintiffs\n\nin employment discrimination suits.48 Because Congress chose to increase the remedies\n\navailable to Title VII plaintiffs, our court would put an end to the substantial settlements\n\navailable to Title VII plaintiffs though the class action device.\n\n   The result the majority reaches is all the more anomalous given the origins of the current\n\nRule 23. The rule was rewritten in 1966, and subpart (b)(2) “was added . . . primarily to\n\n\n\n\n   45\n        H.R. Rep. No. 102-40(I), at 14 (1991), reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 549, 552.\n\n   46\n        42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3).\n   47\n      See Betsy McKay, Coca-Cola Agrees to Settle Bias Suit for $192.5 Million, WALL ST.

Treasure Chest Casino,\n\nLLC.50 In Mullen, we affirmed a district court order certifying, under Rule 23(b)(3), a class\n\nconsisting of 100 to 150 crew members aboard a casino ship who allegedly suffered\n\nrespiratory illnesses caused by a defective ventilation system aboard the ship. Even though\n\nwe recognized that individualized proof of causation, damages, and contributory negligence\n\nwould be necessary for each class member, we held that the predominance requirement of\n\n23(b)(3) was met, since the common issues of seaman status, vessel status, negligence, and\n\nseaworthiness met the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).51 We approved a class\n\ncertification order where the district court planned to try common issues in a class trial, and\n\nindividual issues of causation, damages and comparative negligence in a second phase of\n\ntrials.52\n\n   Other circuits have agreed with the district court in the pending case that equitable claims\n\n\n    49\n         7A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1775 (2d ed. 1986).\n    50\n         186 F.3d 620 (5th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1159 (2000)\n    51\n         Id. at 626-27.\n    52\n         Id. at 623.\n\n                                                      25\n\fcan be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) and legal claims for compensatory and punitive damages\n\ncan be certified under Rule 23(b)(3).53 In my view, the district court committed no legal\n\nerrors in reaching its decision.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n   The matter of punitive damages presents a particular respect in which the majority here,\n\nas well as the majority in Allison, fail to follow controlling circuit precedent. In Jenkins v.\n\nRaymark Industries., Inc.,54 this court held that punitive damages is a common question for\n\nclass action resolution. Under the Jenkins bifurcated trial plan, common issues were to be\n\ntried by a class jury, and individual issues of causation, actual damages, and comparative fault\n\nwere to be in later trials.55 Jenkins has not been overruled by any en banc decision of this\n\ncourt or any subsequent Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court has explained that the\n\n“imposition of punitive damages is an expression of . . . moral condemnation.”56 That\n\ndecision is better made by addressing the harm, not necessarily the precise dollar count, done\n\nto the class.\n\n   The majority describes Jenkins as “binding circuit precedent,” but regards it as not\n\n\n\n\n    53\n     See Jefferson v. Ingersoll Int’l, Inc., 195 F.3d 894, 898 (7th Cir. 1999); Eubanks v. Billington, 110 F.3d\n87, 96 (D.C.

American Dental Ass’n,57 and “the statutory\n\nrequirement that the defendants’ intent be directed against an aggrieved individual.” Again,\n\nI am at a loss to find anything about Title VII and the amendments of 1991 that make Title\n\nVII particularly ill-suited to class action treatment. The “statutory requirement” on which the\n\nmajority relies appears to be 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1), which provides that punitive damages\n\nmay be recovered if the defendant engaged in discriminatory conduct “with malice or with\n\nreckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.” This\n\nprovision simply sets out the mens rea requirement for the recovery of punitive damages. To\n\nread this language to prohibit a single, class-wide award of punitive damages is wholly\n\nunwarranted under the wording of the statute itself and, as discussed above, a bizarre\n\nconsequence for a statute intended to expand the remedies and protections available to\n\nemployees under the civil rights laws.\n\n  As for Kolstad, the Supreme Court did not there say anything to reject the notion that a\n\nsingle punitive damage award can, in appropriate cases, be made by a jury sitting in a class\n\naction dispute. Kolstad did not address this question. Kolstad holds that an employer can be\n\nassessed punitive damages for the acts of a managerial agent acting in the scope of his\n\nemployment, but not where the discriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents\n\n“are contrary to the employer’s good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII.”58 When faced\n\nwith evidence of discriminatory acts of its managerial agents, an employer’s defense that it\n\n   57\n        527 U.S. 526 (1999).\n   58\n        Kolstad, 527 U.S. at 545 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                     27\n\fengaged in a good-faith effort to comply with Title VII is particularly well-suited to class or\n\nsubclass determination. The Court describes this defense as “whether the [defendant] had\n\nbeen making good faith efforts to enforce an antidiscrimination policy.”59 Whether an\n\nemployer has made a good faith effort to enforce an antidiscrimination “policy,” almost by\n\ndefinition, is a question common to all class members’ cases where class action requirements\n\nare otherwise present, and only heightens the commonality of the claims of class members.\n\n\n\n   As discussed above, this court has recognized that personal injury cases are sometimes\n\nsuitable for class action treatment. The availability of compensatory and punitive damages\n\nto Title VII plaintiffs, by virtue of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, make Title VII cases all the\n\nmore similar to personal injury cases, and I fail to see any meaningful basis for the court to\n\ncreate a “Title VII exception” to Rule 23. If anything, the congressional purpose of\n\nexpanding the protections and remedies available to Title VII plaintiffs which motivated the\n\npassage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 weighs against the recognition of such an exception.\n\nAnd the common issues of federal law presented in Title VII cases make Title VII a strange\n\nbody of law to exempt from the class action device. Unlike mass tort cases whose class\n\nmembers may come from different states, Title VII cases are not plagued by the complexities\n\nof applying the laws of different states to different class members, a central failing of the class\n\n\n\n\n   59\n        Id. at 546.\n\n                                                28\n\fcertification in the tobacco class action we decertified.60\n\n  I would follow precedent, adhere to the abuse of discretion standard, and affirm.\n\n\n\n\n   60\n        Castano v.

I would affirm.\n\n  The fault is said to be the lack of predominance of the class-wide discriminatory pattern\n\nclaim over individual damage claims and the lack of superiority or efficiency of a class action\n\nproceeding over individual trials. The district court explained, at pages 680-83, why the claim\n\nof the 200 salaried black employees, a homogenous group who suffered similar damages from\n\nan employer’s alleged policy of intentional discrimination, predominated. And the court then\n\nexplained why the class action would be far superior to individual trials in fair and efficient\n\nadjudication, the latter path tying up the court for at least 200 weeks. One wonders where\n\nthese two circuit judges have acquired the expertise to fault this experienced trial judge on the\n\nmanagement of his trials. They concede that this decision is one for his discretion.\n\n  Actually, though purporting to recognize “the essentially factual basis of the certification\n\ninquiry,” the majority pays little attention to the factual particulars of the case and does not\n\naddress any erroneous finding in concluding that an abuse of discretion has been committed.\n\nThis opinion does much more than override a district court’s judgment in a specific case. It\n\ndoes indeed address an error of law, and that error is seen as the granting of certification of\n\fa class where its members seek individual damages. The Fifth Circuit rule of law, if this\n\nopinion stands, is that there can be no class action where the class members seek individual\n\npersonal damages beyond those incidental to a claim for equitable relief. The very same\n\nconsiderations and rule would apply whatever the nature of the common claim. In this\n\nrespect, Rule 23 applies to Title VII as amended in 1991 as it does to any other claim. That\n\nchanges Rule 23(b)(3) and departs from precedent as well as the advisory committee’s note\n\nwhich states that “(b)(3) encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve\n\neconomies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of decision as to persons\n\nsimilarly situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable\n\nresults.”39\n\n   Twenty-four years ago the Supreme Court prescribed a different rule and model for the\n\nclass action where the class claims a pattern or practice of discrimination. International\n\nBrotherhood of Teamsters v. United States.40 The trial proceeds in two or more stages. At\n\nthe first stage, the plaintiffs’ “burden is to demonstrate that unlawful discrimination has been\n\na regular procedure or policy followed by an employer or group of employers.”41 If the\n\nplaintiffs seek individual relief as victims of that practice, the case moves to the next stage to\n\ndetermine the consequences to the individual, where the class members are entitled to a\n\n\n\n\n    39\n         FED.

Citgo Petroleum Corp.,43 will, at this\n\ntime, be treated only as a Title VII exception to Rule 23. These opinions point to the 1991\n\namendment as radically changing, or forbidding, class actions in Title VII cases. That is an\n\ninexplicable position, because the amendment did nothing more than allow legal damages for\n\nclaimants; and that factor had been no bar to class actions in employment cases brought under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1981. But if this is Fifth Circuit law, only Title VII class actions for equitable\n\nrelief (including back pay) remain.

This situation raises questions of\n\nnumerousness and commonality under Rule 23(a). If, after notice to the class members,\n\nsimultaneous individual suits for legal damages were allowed, perhaps the class action could\n\nproceed. That legal rigmarole might please my colleagues but certainly not the trial court and\n\nthose plaintiffs forced to endure the expense and delay of individual trials.\n\n  Moreover, Congress did not intend to foreclose the benefits of class action treatment to\n\ninjured parties by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The purposes of the Act were “first, to\n\nprovide monetary remedies for victims of intentional employment discrimination to\n\ncompensate them for resulting injuries and to provide more effective deterrence; and second,\n\nto respond to the Supreme Court’s recent decisions by restoring federal civil rights protections\n\n\n\n\n  44\n    (...continued)\nissues, and courts might recognize that individual suits for compensatory damages should not be barred by a\njudgment in a related class action, if the court hearing the class action concluded that compensatory damages\nwere not amenable to resolution in a class action, and chose to hear only claims for equitable relief.

If one doubts that the class action\n\nis an important tool to plaintiffs seeking redress for employment discrimination, witness the\n\nrecent Coca-Cola settlement of an employee class action alleging race discrimination.47\n\nEarlier settlements of an employee class action suit against Texaco, which the present suit\n\nfollowed, and one against Mitsubishi, further attest to the value of the class action to plaintiffs\n\nin employment discrimination suits.48 Because Congress chose to increase the remedies\n\navailable to Title VII plaintiffs, our court would put an end to the substantial settlements\n\navailable to Title VII plaintiffs though the class action device.\n\n   The result the majority reaches is all the more anomalous given the origins of the current\n\nRule 23. The rule was rewritten in 1966, and subpart (b)(2) “was added . . . primarily to\n\n\n\n\n   45\n        H.R. Rep.

Treasure Chest Casino,\n\nLLC.50 In Mullen, we affirmed a district court order certifying, under Rule 23(b)(3), a class\n\nconsisting of 100 to 150 crew members aboard a casino ship who allegedly suffered\n\nrespiratory illnesses caused by a defective ventilation system aboard the ship. Even though\n\nwe recognized that individualized proof of causation, damages, and contributory negligence\n\nwould be necessary for each class member, we held that the predominance requirement of\n\n23(b)(3) was met, since the common issues of seaman status, vessel status, negligence, and\n\nseaworthiness met the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).51 We approved a class\n\ncertification order where the district court planned to try common issues in a class trial, and\n\nindividual issues of causation, damages and comparative negligence in a second phase of\n\ntrials.52\n\n   Other circuits have agreed with the district court in the pending case that equitable claims\n\n\n    49\n         7A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1775 (2d ed. 1986).\n    50\n         </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18251\"><a href=\"/opinion/18251/mullen-v-treasure-chest/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000)\n    51\n         Id. at 626-27.\n    52\n         Id. at 623.\n\n                                                      25\n\fcan be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) and legal claims for compensatory and punitive damages\n\ncan be certified under Rule 23(b)(3).53 In my view, the district court committed no legal\n\nerrors in reaching its decision.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n   The matter of punitive damages presents a particular respect in which the majority here,\n\nas well as the majority in Allison, fail to follow controlling circuit precedent. In Jenkins v.\n\nRaymark Industries., Inc.,54 this court held that punitive damages is a common question for\n\nclass action resolution. Under the Jenkins bifurcated trial plan, common issues were to be\n\ntried by a class jury, and individual issues of causation, actual damages, and comparative fault\n\nwere to be in later trials.55 Jenkins has not been overruled by any en banc decision of this\n\ncourt or any subsequent Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court has explained that the\n\n“imposition of punitive damages is an expression of . . . moral condemnation.”56 That\n\ndecision is better made by addressing the harm, not necessarily the precise dollar count, done\n\nto the class.\n\n   The majority describes Jenkins as “binding circuit precedent,” but regards it as not\n\n\n\n\n    53\n     See Jefferson v.

American Dental Ass’n,57 and “the statutory\n\nrequirement that the defendants’ intent be directed against an aggrieved individual.” Again,\n\nI am at a loss to find anything about Title VII and the amendments of 1991 that make Title\n\nVII particularly ill-suited to class action treatment. The “statutory requirement” on which the\n\nmajority relies appears to be 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1), which provides that punitive damages\n\nmay be recovered if the defendant engaged in discriminatory conduct “with malice or with\n\nreckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.” This\n\nprovision simply sets out the mens rea requirement for the recovery of punitive damages. To\n\nread this language to prohibit a single, class-wide award of punitive damages is wholly\n\nunwarranted under the wording of the statute itself and, as discussed above, a bizarre\n\nconsequence for a statute intended to expand the remedies and protections available to\n\nemployees under the civil rights laws.\n\n  As for Kolstad, the Supreme Court did not there say anything to reject the notion that a\n\nsingle punitive damage award can, in appropriate cases, be made by a jury sitting in a class\n\naction dispute. Kolstad did not address this question. Kolstad holds that an employer can be\n\nassessed punitive damages for the acts of a managerial agent acting in the scope of his\n\nemployment, but not where the discriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents\n\n“are contrary to the employer’s good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII.”58 When faced\n\nwith evidence of discriminatory acts of its managerial agents, an employer’s defense that it\n\n   57\n        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118313\"><a href=\"/opinion/118313/kolstad-v-american-dental-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999).\n   58\n        Kolstad, 527 U.S. at 545 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                     27\n\fengaged in a good-faith effort to comply with Title VII is particularly well-suited to class or\n\nsubclass determination. The Court describes this defense as “whether the [defendant] had\n\nbeen making good faith efforts to enforce an antidiscrimination policy.”59 Whether an\n\nemployer has made a good faith effort to enforce an antidiscrimination “policy,” almost by\n\ndefinition, is a question common to all class members’ cases where class action requirements\n\nare otherwise present, and only heightens the commonality of the claims of class members.\n\n\n\n   As discussed above, this court has recognized that personal injury cases are sometimes\n\nsuitable for class action treatment. The availability of compensatory and punitive damages\n\nto Title VII plaintiffs, by virtue of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, make Title VII cases all the\n\nmore similar to personal injury cases, and I fail to see any meaningful basis for the court to\n\ncreate a “Title VII exception” to Rule 23. If anything, the congressional purpose of\n\nexpanding the protections and remedies available to Title VII plaintiffs which motivated the\n\npassage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 weighs against the recognition of such an exception.\n\nAnd the common issues of federal law presented in Title VII cases make Title VII a strange\n\nbody of law to exempt from the class action device. Unlike mass tort cases whose class\n\nmembers may come from different states, Title VII cases are not plagued by the complexities\n\nof applying the laws of different states to different class members, a central failing of the class\n\n\n\n\n   59\n        Id. at 546.\n\n                                                28\n\fcertification in the tobacco class action we decertified.60\n\n  I would follow precedent, adhere to the abuse of discretion standard, and affirm.\n\n\n\n\n   60\n        Castano v.
