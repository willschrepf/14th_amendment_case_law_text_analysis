Opinion filed March 4, 2016. Suspension.\n\n\n        Michael R. Serra, Deputy Disciplinary Administrator, argued the cause, and Stanton A. Hazlett,\nDisciplinary Administrator, was with him on the brief for the petitioner.\n\n\n        Caleb Boone, of Hays, argued the cause and was on the brief for respondent, and Charles P.\nVaughn, respondent, argued the cause pro se.\n\n\n        Per Curiam: This is an original proceeding in discipline filed by the office of the\nDisciplinary Administrator against the respondent, Charles P. Vaughn, of Inverness,\nFlorida, an attorney admitted to the practice of law in Kansas in 1981.\n\n\n        On June 15, 2015, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a formal\ncomplaint against the respondent alleging violations of the Kansas Rules of Professional\nConduct (KRPC). The respondent filed an answer on July 6, 2015. A hearing was held on\nthe complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on August\n20, 2015, where the respondent was present by telephone and was represented by\ncounsel. The hearing panel determined that respondent violated KRPC 1.2(a) (2015 Kan.\nCt. R. Annot. 456) (scope of representation); 1.3 (2015 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 461)\n(diligence); 1.4(a) (2015 Kan. Ct. R.

The respondent has also been admitted to the practice of law in other\n       jurisdictions. In January 1987, the Florida Supreme Court admitted the respondent to the\n       practice of law. In February 1988, the Colorado Supreme Court admitted the respondent\n       to the practice of law. In July 1994, the Montana Supreme Court admitted the respondent\n       to the practice of law.\n\n\n               \"9.      On June 25, 2014, a report of referee was entered in the Supreme Court\n       of Florida, in Florida Bar vs. Charles Paul Vaughn, in case number SC13-2150. The\n       report provided as follows:\n\n\n                                       \"REPORT OF REFEREE\n\n\n                        ....\n\n\n               \"II.     FINDING OF FACT\n\n\n                        ....\n\n\n                        \"Narrative Summary of Case. In or around August 2010,\n               respondent was hired to represent [E.D.] in a dissolution of marriage\n               proceeding. [E.D.]'s fees were paid by his friend, [C.C.], by credit card in\n               two separate payments, one in the amount of $2,500.00 for attorney fees,\n                                                    2\n\fand the other in the amount of $500.00 for costs. These funds were\nplaced in an account Respondent referred to as his cost account. During\nthe pendency of the matter, in or around December 2010, Respondent\ndisbursed $75.00 of the cost funds for the services of a court reporter.\nThere was no testimony presented that respondent removed his fees,\nwhich were non-refundable, from the cost account within a reasonable\ntime period and there was no testimony presented that any other costs\nwere incurred.\n\n\n        \"The trial in the [E.D.] matter was scheduled for April 11, 2011.\nOne of the matters of utmost importance to [E.D.] was that a court\nreporter be present for the trial. However, neither respondent nor his staff\nscheduled a court reporter and a court reporter was not present. The\nparties eventually reached a settlement agreement, the terms of which\nwere presented to the trial judge.\n\n\n        \"Opposing counsel prepared the proposed final judgment and\nforwarded it to respondent for review. Respondent requested that\nopposing counsel add a paragraph addressing the minor child's school\nattendance and issues related to tardiness. Other than that change, the\nevidence established that respondent sought no other changes to the\nproposed order and opposing counsel forwarded it to the trial court.\nThereafter, respondent's office forwarded the proposed final judgment to\n[E.D.] for his review. Upon receipt of the proposed final judgment,\n[E.D.] immediately notified respondent by email and then spoke with his\nstaff the next day, informing respondent and his staff that the proposed\nfinal judgment contained errors and that respondent should not allow the\njudge to sign the order as drafted. There was no evidence presented that\nrespondent attempted to address the matter at that time with opposing\ncounsel or the court. The trial court issued the final judgment, which was\nnot consistent with the agreement between the parties, on May 9, 2011.\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\f          \"Once [E.D.] received the signed final judgment, he notified\nrespondent the order had not been corrected and that he wanted it to\ncorrectly reflect the parties' agreement. In an email, [E.D.] again pointed\nout his issues of concern and the fact that he had specifically requested\nthat respondent stop the judge from signing the proposed final judgment\nbecause it did not reflect the agreement of the parties. While the evidence\nindicated there was some contact between opposing counsel and\nrespondent's staff regarding the incorrect order, there was no testimony\nor evidence presented indicating respondent attempted to address the\nmatter.\n\n\n          \"An amended final judgment was submitted for the trial court's\nreview. However, the correction made was of no significance to [E.D.].\nThe correction failed to address the child visitation and/or child support\nissues that [E.D.] had raised with respondent. Rather, the only correction\nmade was more of a typographical correction, as testified to by opposing\ncounsel, as it simply omitted a paragraph that had been placed in the\nproposed final judgment in error. The omitted paragraph indicated the\nparties had entered into a written settlement agreement when in fact the\nparties had reached an oral settlement agreement. The amended final\njudgment, which was entered on June 8, 2011, reflected the removal of\nthat paragraph.\n\n\n          \"As before, upon receipt of the incorrect amended final\njudgment, [E.D.] immediately notified respondent via email, in a rather\ndirect fashion, that none of his issues of concern had been addressed. He\ndemanded that respondent 'fix it.' In addition to the concerns related to\nchild visitation and child support, [E.D.] also notified respondent that the\nbilling invoice he had received contained double billings and other\nbilling items that he questioned. In his correspondence to respondent,\n[E.D.] made it clear that once the order was corrected to reflect the\nagreement between the parties, then the issues regarding the billing\nwould be discussed. However, the evidence presented failed to show that\n\n                                     4\n\frespondent and/or his staff addressed the billing concerns raised by\n[E.D.].\n\n\n          \"At or around the end of August 2011, respondent forwarded a\ncorrected amended final judgment to [E.D.] for his review. In separate\ncorrespondence respondent also notified [E.D.] that he had a duty to pay\nrespondent's outstanding attorney's fees and that if [E.D.] failed to do so,\nrespondent would pursue all collection avenues available to him. The\namount respondent notified [E.D.] he owed included the items for which\n[E.D.] had been double billed. Shortly thereafter, [E.D.] notified the\nrespondent the corrected amended final judgment reflected the agreement\nbetween the parties. He also specifically outlined the issues he had with\nrespondent's billing invoice and indicated that he believed he owed\nrespondent substantially less than respondent was invoicing. In addition,\nhe forwarded a $50.00 check, explaining that was the amount he would\nbe able to pay respondent each month until respondent was paid in full.\nRespondent cashed the check. However, he failed to file the corrected\namended final judgment and he failed to notify [E.D.] he would not agree\nto being paid only $50.00 a month.\n\n\n          \"The evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrated respondent\nfailed to correct or address the billing issues. Likewise, the evidence\nclearly and convincingly demonstrated while respondent cashed [E.D.]'s\n$50.00 check, respondent had no desire to enter into a payment plan with\n[E.D.], especially in an amount of only $50.00 per month and that\nrespondent failed to address this issue with [E.D.]. Further the evidence\nclearly demonstrated respondent made a conscious decision at that time\nthat he would not file the corrected amended final judgment until and\nunless he received the remainder of his representation fee.\n\n\n          \"The evidence also established that [E.D.] failed to make any\nfurther payments to respondent. [E.D.] testified that he did not pay\nanything further because respondent failed to complete the representation\n\n                                     5\n\fby filing the corrected amended judgment with the court. [E.D.] was\nclear that he believed respondent had a duty to complete the matter and\nthat he was not going to pay until respondent performed the services for\nwhich he had been hired. The evidence further established that\nrespondent did not take any steps to follow up on the matter nor did he\nmove to withdraw.\n\n\n          \"Thereafter, in or around January 2012, respondent forwarded\n[E.D.]'s file to a collection agency. Based upon the invoices entered into\nevidence and the testimony presented, respondent had not addressed the\ndouble billing issues prior to sending the matter to collections.\nConsequently, the collection agency was attempting to recover all funds\non respondent's behalf, including funds that had been improperly double-\nbilled.\n\n\n          \"[E.D.] then sought recourse through the Better Business Bureau\nby filing a complaint in or around March 2012. He complained about\nrespondent's conduct as [well] as the billing issues. It was only after\n[E.D.] had to resort to contacting the Better Business Bureau that\nrespondent finally addressed the double billing issue. However, in\nresponding to same, he implied that while he had corrected the billing\nissues, [E.D.] still refused to pay the fees owed. Upon review of the\nevidence, it is clear that the same day respondent responded to the Better\nBusiness Bureau is the same day he corrected his billing invoices. As\nsuch, the implication being made by respondent in his response to the\nBetter Business Bureau was less than forthright. In addition to the\nforegoing, respondent also invoiced [E.D.] for the time spent addressing\nthe Better Business Bureau complaint and did not remove the charge\nfrom the billing invoices until after The Florida Bar became involved.\nThe evidence presented in this regard demonstrated that respondent\neither failed to review the billing invoices in timely manner and address\nthe error, or he simply refused to do so because he was not being paid.\n\n\n                                     6\n\f        \"However, respondent engaged in other, more serious\nmisconduct than that discussed above. The evidence showed clearly and\nconvincingly that respondent applied the remaining $425.00 of cost\nfunds he received to pay a portion of his attorney's fees and that he did\nnot receive his client's permission to do so. Respondent and his assistant\ntestified that the cost funds were always in the cost account. The other\nevidence presented, which consisted of the billing invoices and a ledger\ncard, which was prepared manually and at a much later date does not\nsupport respondent's nor his assistant's position in that regard. The ledger\ncard does not comport with respondent's billing invoices and contains\nerrors. When questioned about why the cost funds were not segregated\non the invoices and why invoices always showed that the entire retainer\npaid was applied, neither respondent nor his assistant provided a credible\nanswer. For example, on the April 11, 2011, invoice prepared by\nrespondent's office, the total amount of attorney's fees incurred was\n$5,398.50. The total disbursement (for the court reporter) was $75.00.\nThus, the invoice indicates the total fee and disbursements equaled\n$5,473.50, less the retainers applied of $3,000.00 for a balance due of\n$2,473.50. Lastly, the invoice lists the payment detail noting attorney\nfees of 2500/costs 500 for total payments of $3000.00. . . .\n\n\n        \"Respondent and his assistant testified that the program simply\nworked that way and there was nothing that could be done. They testified\nthat there was no way to ensure that the invoices the clients received\naccurately reflected how the payments were actually made. In essence,\nwhat respondent and his assistant testified to was that despite what the\ninvoices stated, respondent did not use the remaining $425.00 towards\nhis attorney's fees. This referee finds this testimony by respondent and\nhis assistant lacking in credibility. Moreover, if respondent is to be\nbelieved, he did nothing to ensure that there was some type of\nnotification to his clients the cost funds being held by respondent were\nnot being used towards his attorney's fees. The invoices respondent\nprovided to his clients clearly stated otherwise and the position espoused\n\n                                     7\n\fby respondent, that there was simply nothing that could be done to\naccurately reflect how the funds paid by a client is disbursed, is\nuntenable.\n\n\n           \"The evidence and testimony presented in this regard clearly and\nconvincingly established that respondent used the cost funds for a\npurpose other than that for which the funds had been provided. The\nevidence also clearly and convincingly established that respondent knew\nlittle about how the system worked. Likewise, the evidence and\ntestimony clearly and convincingly demonstrated that respondent left the\nbilling issues up to his non-lawyer staff and that he had little to do with\nit. This referee did not find that respondent's lack of knowledge and/or\ninterest in how his billing system worked to be a valid excuse for the\nmanner in which the cost funds were handled. Respondent's conduct was\nnot a mere technical violation of the trust rules and was disturbing to this\nreferee.\n\n\n           \"Respondent similarly failed to properly and forthrightly address\nthe issues related to the hiring of the court reporter. The evidence clearly\nestablished that a court reporter was not present at the dissolution trial on\nApril 11, 2011, despite the fact [E.D.] had been emphatic that a court\nreporter was to be present for all court proceedings. In one piece of\ncorrespondence to [E.D.], respondent stated that a court reporter was\npresent, but that since there was no trial, there was nothing for the court\nreporter to monitor. On the other hand, in response to [E.D.]\napproximately one year later, respondent stated that he had a court\nreporter on standby, but that he did not want to get stuck with the court\nreporter's bills like he had been stuck with his attorney's fees. This later\nresponse is clearly suspect.\n\n\n           \"There was no credible evidence presented during the final\nhearing that, at the time of the trial in the [E.D.] dissolution matter,\nrespondent had notified [E.D.] he owed additional attorneys fees, [E.D.]\n\n                                       8\n\fhad been presented with an invoice showing he owed additional\nattorney's fees, or [E.D.] had refused to pay any additional attorney's\nfees. Rather, the evidence established that respondent had been away on\nvacation and that he failed to obtain a court reporter and that his staff had\neither not been instructed to obtain a court reporter or had failed to do so.\nThe evidence presented by respondent that he may have had or may have\nattempted to have a court reporter on standby was not sufficiently clear\nor supported by other testimony and evidence presented. This referee\nfound respondent's testimony and insistence that he could have had a\ncourt reporter present self-serving and lacking in credibility.\n\n\n        \"And finally, a grave concern to this referee was respondent's\nfailure to submit the corrected amended final judgment to the trial court\nuntil some two years after the incorrect amended final judgment had\nbeen issued. Again, respondent did nothing to address this matter until\nafter the bar's involvement. Further, the evidence established respondent\nfailed to notify [E.D.] when he finally submitted the corrected amended\nfinal judgment to the trial court. By the time respondent filed the\ncorrected amended final judgment and the trial court entered the order on\nJuly 23, 2013, nunc pro tunc to April 11, 2011, the parties involved have\nbeen forced to live with an incorrect order for more than two years. This\nreferee finds this to be an intolerable breach of ethics.\n\n\n        \"Respondent's testimony in regard to his failure to complete\n[E.D.]'s matter was especially troubling to this referee. Respondent fully\nrecognized that his client's matter was not resolved due to respondent's\nlack of diligence and that his failure in this regard required his client to\nlive with an incorrect order that harmed his client. Respondent made a\nconscious decision to hold his client's matter 'hostage' until he was paid.\nRespondent testified that if his client had just paid him a 'little more' he\nwould have completed the matter and written the fees off. However,\nrespondent's testimony is not credible and is clearly belied by his actual\nconduct. Respondent did absolutely nothing to fulfill his obligations to\n\n                                      9\n\fhis client because he allowed his own interests, that being paid, to over-\nride his professional and ethical duty to his client.\n\n\n        \"The evidence presented in this matter, by way of testimony and\nexhibits, clearly and convincingly established that respondent failed to\nabide by his client's decisions, that he failed to act diligently for his\nclient, that he failed to properly and adequately communicate with his\nclient, that he made misrepresentations to his client, that he used cost\nfunds improperly, and that he harmed not only his client for his own\ngain, but in doing so, he also harmed the judicial system and our\nprofession.\n\n\n\"III.   RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO GUILT\n\n\n        \"I recommend that Respondent be found guilty of violating the\nfollowing Rules Regulating The Florida Bar:\n\n\n        \"4-1.2(a) Subject to divisions (c) and (d), a lawyer shall abide by\na client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation, and, as\nrequired by rule 4-1.4, shall reasonably consult with the client as to the\nmeans by which they are to be pursued. A lawyer may take such action\non behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the\nrepresentation. A lawyer shall abide by the client's decision whether to\nsettle a matter. In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client's\ndecision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered,\nwhether to waive jury trial, and whether the client will testify;\n\n\n        \"4-1.3 A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and\npromptness in representing a client;\n\n\n        \"4-1.4(a) A lawyer shall promptly inform the client of any\ndecision or circumstance with respect to which the client's informed\nconsent, as defined in terminology, is required by these rules; (2)\n\n                                      10\n\freasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client's\nobjectives are to be accomplished; (3) keep the client reasonably\ninformed about the status of the matter; and (4) promptly comply with\nreasonable requests for information;\n\n\n        \"4-8.4(c) A lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving\ndishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation;\n\n\n        \"4-8.4(d) A lawyer shall not engage in conduct in connection\nwith the practice of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice,\nincluding to knowingly, or through callous indifference, disparage,\nhumiliate, or discriminate against litigants, jurors, witnesses, court\npersonnel, or other lawyers on any basis, including, but not limited to, on\naccount of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, national origin, disability,\nmarital status, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status,\nemployment, or physical characteristic; and\n\n\n        \"5-1.1(b) Money or other property entrusted to an attorney for a\nspecific purpose, including advances for fees, costs, and expenses, is held\nin trust and must be applied only to that purpose. Money and other\nproperty of clients coming into the hands of an attorney are not subject to\ncounterclaim or setoff for attorney's fees, and a refusal to account for and\ndeliver over such property upon demand shall be deemed a conversion.\n\n\n\"IV.    STANDARDS FOR IMPOSING LAWYER SANCTIONS\n\n\n        \"I considered the following factors prior to recommending\ndiscipline: the duty violated, the lawyer's mental state, the potential or\nactual injury caused by respondent's misconduct, and the existence of\nmitigating and aggravating circumstances. I also considered, pursuant to\nThe Florida Bar v. Liberman, 43 So.3d 36, 39 (Fla. 2010) citing to the\ncriteria enunciated in The Florida Bar v. Pahules, 233 So.2d 130, 132\n(Fla. 1970) that the sanction recommended and imposed must be (1) fair\n\n                                     11\n\fto the disciplined attorney, being sufficient to punish while at the same\ntime encouraging rehabilitation; (2) fair to society, both in terms of\nprotecting the public from unethical conduct and at the same time not\ndenying the public the service of a qualified lawyer as a result of undue\nharshness; and (3) severe enough to deter others who might be tempted\nto engage in like violations. Finally, I considered the fact that the Court\nhas moved toward stronger sanctions for attorney misconduct in recent\nyears. The Florida Bar v. Herman, 8 So.2d 1100, 1108 (Fla. 2009) citing\nThe Florida Bar v. Rotstein, 835 So.2d 241, 246 (Fla. 2003).\n\n\n          \"The bar argued the following aggravating factors exist in this\ncase: 9.22(b) dishonest or selfish motive; 9.22(d) multiple offenses;\n9.22(h) vulnerability of the victim; 9.22(i) substantial experience in the\npractice of law and 12.1(b) actual harm to the client. Counsel on behalf\nof respondent argued the only two aggravating factors applicable in this\ncase were 9.22(d) multiple offenses (due to the fact numerous rule\nviolations were found) and 9.22(i) substantial experience in the practice\nof law.\n\n\n          \"In mitigation, the bar acknowledged that 9.32(a) absence of a\nprior disciplinary record and 9.32(g) character or reputation were\napplicable in this matter. Respondent argued that not only were 9.32(a)\nand 9.32(g) applicable, but that 9.32(b) absence of dishonest or selfish\nmotive; 9.32(c) personal or emotional problems; and 9.32(e) full and free\ndisclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward\nproceedings; and 9.32(l) remorse also applied.\n\n\n          \"After careful consideration of the aggravating factors as applied\nto the facts before me and the arguments made by the bar and\nrespondent, I find not only were the aggravating factors of 9.22(b),\n9.22(d), 9.22(h) and 9.22(i), applicable in this matter, but I also find\naggravating factor 9.22(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of\nconduct applies.\n\n                                     12\n\f        \"I find the mitigating factors for 9.32(a), 9.32(e) and 9.32(g)\nwere demonstrated in this case. However, I did not find respondent\nlacked a selfish or dishonest motive [9.32(b)], nor did I find he\ndemonstrated he suffered from personal or emotional problems [9.32(c)],\nand finally I did not find respondent demonstrated remorse [9.32(l)].\n\n\n        \"In regard to the finding that these three mitigating factors are\nnot applicable in this case, this referee determined respondent displayed\ndishonesty and selfishness. He made misrepresentations to his client, he\nused cost funds improperly, and he clearly placed his own interests above\nthose of his client's. Further, the limited evidence presented during the\nhearing does not support a determination [sic] respondent's personal\nmatters (he was engaged in personal post-dissolution proceedings) were\nso consuming and/or overwhelming that he could not reasonably fulfill\nhis obligations to his client. Furthermore, if the nature of respondent's\npersonal problems were such that he could not provide reasonable,\ncompetent, diligent representation to his client, then respondent had a\nduty to notify this client that he was unable to fulfill his obligations and\nassist his client in finding another attorney. And finally, while respondent\nexpressed remorse during a mitigation hearing, and while he apologized\nto the referee, the legal profession, and his client, this referee found the\napology insufficient and untimely. Moreover, there was no evidence\npresented that respondent had actually apologized to his client for failing\nto timely address his matters, for failing to properly communicate, for\nfailing to abide by his client's instructions to have a court reporter\npresent, and for forcing his client to seek assistance to the Better\nBusiness Bureau and The Florida Bar. Apologizing in a setting in which\nthe client was not present is of little consequence.\n\n\n        \"In this case, respondent, in essence, held his client's matter\nhostage in an effort to force his client to pay respondent's outstanding\nattorney's fees. The respondent clearly put his interests before those of\n\n                                     13\n\fhis client and his actions were knowing and deliberate. In determining\nthat respondent refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his\nconduct, this referee is mindful of the numerous opportunities respondent\nhad to address his client's concerns and the fact he failed to do so.\n\n\n        \"In addition to the foregoing, I also considered the following\nStandards argued by the parties: 4.12 (suspension is appropriate when a\nlawyer knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client\nproperty and causes injury or potential injury to a client); 4.14\n(admonishment is appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in dealing with\nclient property and causes little or no actual or potential injury to a client\nor where there is a technical violation of the trust account rules or where\nthere is an unintentional mishandling of client property); 4.42(a)\n(suspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform\nservices for a client and causes injury or potential injury to a client); 4.62\n(suspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly deceives a client,\nand causes injury or potential injury to a client); and 7.2 (suspension is\nappropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a\nviolation of a duty owed as a professional and causes injury or potential\ninjury to a client, the public, or the legal system).\n\n\n        \"Respondent argued that his conduct in this case was an\naberration and that the testimony of his character witnesses, which\nincluded but was not limited to, judges and other attorneys, supported\nhim in this regard. He additionally argued that the mishandling of the\ncost funds was unintentional and that once errors (such as the\noverbilling) were pointed out to him, the errors were corrected. He also\nargued [E.D.] was not actually harmed because the [sic] he and his ex-\nwife were not abiding by the court's order and had not been. Further,\nrespondent argued he was simply attempting to be paid for the services\nhe had rendered, and that no misrepresentations had been made. And\nfinally, respondent argued that the strength of his mitigation, which\nincluded not only his character and reputation, but also the fact he had\n\n                                      14\n\fbeen a practicing attorney for 27 years without a blemish, he is a death-\nqualified attorney, he founded the local chapter of the Florida\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers and remains on the Board of\nDirectors, and he provides numerous services to his local community as\ntestified to by Dr. Douglas Alexander, supports a sanction of, at most, a\npublic reprimand.\n\n\n        \"The bar, on the other hand, argued the facts demonstrated\nrespondent engaged in knowing, intentional misconduct, that he placed\nhis interests above those of his client's and that his failure to act\ndiligently created a situation in which [E.D.] chose to disobey the\ndictates of the court's order because it was incorrect. The bar also argued\nrespondent took little interest in correcting billing errors or attempting to\nwork with [E.D.] to address his most significant concerns. The bar\nfurther argued respondent failed to abide by [E.D.]'s instructions and then\npresented a less than forthright explanation to [E.D.] for his failure to do\nso. Finally, the bar argued respondent misused client cost funds by\npaying them to himself to offset attorney's fees. Therefore, the bar argued\nthat, despite the significant mitigation shown, the egregious nature of the\nmisconduct engaged in by respondent warranted a rehabilitative\nsuspension.\n\n\n        \"In determining respondent was guilty of the rule violations\nlisted previously in this report, this Referee determined respondent's\nconduct was intentional and that the bar had met its burden in that regard.\nSee, The Florida Bar v. Fredericks, 731 So.2d 1249 (Fla. 1999).\nRespondent had been notified timely by [E.D.] on more than one\noccasion that the order, as issued by the trial court, was incorrect. He had\nbeen told by [E.D.] that the visitation issues, which were of paramount\nimportance to [E.D.], were not what he had agreed to and that he\ndefinitely wanted the order [sic] be fixed because he had already missed\ntime with his child. Respondent was timely notified of the billing errors\nwhich went unaddressed by respondent until [E.D.] was forced to seek\n\n                                      15\n\fthe assistance of the Better Business Bureau. Respondent improperly\nused client cost funds and failed to rectify the situation until after the\nbar's involvement. In addition, respondent's testimony in regard to the\nhiring of a court reporter, which was also very important to [E.D.], was\nsuspect.\n\n\n           \"But, more importantly, respondent intentionally and deliberately\nheld onto the corrected amended final judgment in an effort to force\npayment from [E.D.]. Respondent's conduct caused [E.D.] to live with an\nincorrect order for a period of two years, simply because respondent\nchose to put his interests before those of his client. Respondent\ndeliberately acted in a manner that placed our system of justice in\njeopardy. The lynch-pin of our legal system is that individuals adhere to\nthe orders issued by our courts. Respondent knew the order was incorrect\nand that it had a negative impact upon his client, yet he did nothing and\nthen attempted to justify his misconduct by arguing that his client was\nnot abiding by the order anyway. This referee finds respondent's conduct\nin this regard and his attempt at justification to be especially egregious.\nThis referee finds the following statement by the Supreme Court of\nFlorida in The Florida Bar v. Varner, 992 So.224, 231 (Fla. 2008)\nespecially applicable in this case: '[t]he profession of the practice of law\nrequires lawyers to be honest, competent, and diligent in their dealings\nwith clients, other lawyers, and courts. Clients expect no less from their\nlawyers and place great trust in lawyers in their times of need. Lawyers\ntrust each other to accurately represent their clients' interests and courts\ntrust lawyers to do the same.' Respondent failed to live up to the ethical\nstandards expected of attorneys in Florida.\n\n\n           ....\n\n\n           \". . . This referee is mindful of the fact that a recommendation of\na rehabilitative suspension is consequential and that if imposed will have\na significant impact on respondent. Likewise, this referee is mindful of\n\n                                       16\n\fthe fact that respondent has no prior discipline history and that the\ntestimony and letters provided in mitigation support a determination is\n[sic] his well thought of in his legal community and his community at\nlarge. Nevertheless, respondent engaged in intentional, knowing,\ndeliberate misconduct. He made misrepresentations, he mishandled client\ncost funds by applying them to his attorney's fees, he deliberately failed\nto finish his client's matter, despite knowing the order, as issued by the\ntrial court was in error, solely because he had not been paid, and he failed\nto properly and adequately communicate and address issues with his\nclient. This referee finds the misconduct in this case to be extremely\nserious and conduct that cannot and should not be tolerated. However,\nthis referee does not find that respondent's misconduct warrants a one\nyear suspension like that imposed in Varner and Centurion, but rather,\nthat a ninety-one day rehabilitative suspension is appropriate.\n\n\n\"VI.    RECOMMENDATION AS TO DISCIPLINARY MEASURES\n        TO BE APPLIED\n\n\n        \"I recommend that Respondent be found guilty of misconduct\njustifying disciplinary measures, and that [sic] be disciplined by:\n\n\n        \"A.

Based upon the referee's report, on September 26, 2014, the Supreme Court of\nFlorida suspended the respondent from the practice of law for a period of 91 days for having\nviolated Florida's equivalent to KRPC 1.2, KRPC 1.3, KRPC 1.4, KRPC 1.15(d), KRPC 8.4(c),\nand KRPC 8.4(d). The respondent's suspension in Florida began October 26, 2014. To date, the\nrespondent has not applied for reinstatement in Florida.\n\n\n        \"11.      Thereafter, Colorado and Montana imposed reciprocal discipline. On December\n15, 2014, the Supreme Court of Colorado suspended the respondent's license to practice law in\nthat state for 91 days. The respondent's license to practice law in Colorado will automatically be\nreinstated once the respondent is reinstated in Florida. The Supreme Court of Montana also\nsuspended the respondent's license to practice law in that state for 91 days.\n\n\n                                        \"Conclusions of Law\n\n\n        \"12.      Based upon Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 202, the respondent's stipulations, and the above\nfindings of fact, the hearing panel concludes as a matter of law that the respondent violated\nKRPC 1.2(a), KRPC 1.3, KRPC 1.4(a), KRPC 1.15(d), KRPC 8.4(c), and KRPC 8.4(d), as\ndetailed below.\n\n\n                                        \"Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 202\n\n\n        \"13.      Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 202 provides, in part, as follows: 'A final adjudication in\nanother jurisdiction that a lawyer has been guilty of misconduct shall establish conclusively the\nmisconduct for purposes of a disciplinary proceeding in this state.' In this case, Florida, Colorado,\nand Montana entered final adjudications that the respondent was guilty of misconduct in those\njurisdictions. Thus, the evidence of those final adjudications is conclusive evidence for purposes\nof this disciplinary proceeding.\n\n\n                                            \"KRPC 1.2(a)\n\n\n        \"14.      KRPC 1.2(a) provides, '[a] lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning\nthe lawful objectives of representation . . . and shall consult with the client as to the means which\nthe lawyer shall choose to pursue. . . .' In this case, the respondent violated KRPC 1.2(a) when he\n\n                                             18\n\ffailed to file the corrected amended final judgment. Thus, the hearing panel concludes that the\nrespondent violated KRPC 1.2(a).\n\n\n                                               \"KRPC 1.3\n\n\n        \"15.     Attorneys must act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing\ntheir clients. See KRPC 1.3. The respondent failed to diligently and promptly represent [E.D.].\nThe respondent failed to promptly prepare and file a corrected amended final judgment. As the\nFlorida referee pointed out, the respondent's lack of diligence caused his client to violate a court's\norder for 2 years. Because the respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness\nin representing his client, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.3.\n\n\n                                              \"KRPC 1.4(a)\n\n\n        \"16.     KRPC 1.4(a) provides that '[a] lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed\nabout the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.' The\nrespondent violated KRPC 1.4(a) when he failed to keep his client adequately informed regarding\nthe status of the case. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated\nKRPC 1.4(a).\n\n\n                                              \"KRPC 1.15\n\n\n        \"17.

Therefore, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent\nviolated KRPC 1.15(d).\n\n\n                                            \"KRPC 8.4(c)\n\n\n        \"18.     'It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . engage in conduct involving\ndishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.' KRPC 8.4(c).

Duty Violated. The respondent violated his duty to his client to provide diligent\nrepresentation and adequate communication. Additionally, the respondent violated his duty to his\nclient to safeguard his client's property. Finally, the respondent violated his duty to the public to\nmaintain his personal integrity.\n\n\n        \"22.     Mental State. The respondent intentionally and knowingly violated his duties.\n\n\n        \"23.     Injury.

Aggravating circumstances are any considerations or factors that may justify an\nincrease in the degree of discipline to be imposed. In reaching its recommendation for discipline,\nthe hearing panel, in this case, found the following aggravating factors present:\n\n\n        \"25.     Dishonest or Selfish Motive. The respondent made misrepresentations to his\nclient, he used cost account improperly, and he placed his own interests above those of his\nclient's. (The respondent established a special account which he referred to as his cost account\nwhich held cost funds so that his clients could pay their costs by credit card.)

Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent committed multiple\noffenses.\n\n\n        \"27.     Substantial Experience in the Practice of Law. The Kansas Supreme Court\nadmitted the respondent to practice law in the State of Kansas in 1981. At the time of the\nmisconduct, the respondent has been practicing law for approximately 30 years.\n\n\n        \"28.     Mitigating circumstances are any considerations or factors that may justify a\nreduction in the degree of discipline to be imposed. In reaching its recommendation for discipline,\nthe hearing panel, in this case, found the following mitigating circumstances present:\n\n\n        \"29.     Absence of Prior Disciplinary Offenses. The only discipline received by the\nrespondent previously was based upon the instant facts. The States of Florida, Colorado, and\nMontana each suspended the respondent for a period of 91 days. Additionally, the State of Florida\nrequired the respondent to establish that he has been rehabilitated, prior to reinstatement. Finally,\nthe respondent is not eligible for reinstatement in Colorado until his license in Florida is\nreinstated.\n\n\n        \"30.     The Present and Past Attitude of the Attorney as Shown by His or Her\nCooperation During the Hearing and His or Her Full and Free Acknowledgment of the\nTransgressions. The respondent fully cooperated with the disciplinary process. Additionally, the\nrespondent stipulated to the facts and rule violations.\n\n\n        \"31.     Previous Good Character and Reputation in the Community Including Any\nLetters from Clients, Friends and Lawyers in Support of the Character and General Reputation of\nthe Attorney. Prior to the misconduct in this case, the respondent was an active and productive\nmember of the bar of Florida. The respondent also enjoyed the respect of his peers and generally\n\n\n                                             22\n\fpossesses a good character and reputation as evidenced by several letters received by the hearing\npanel. These letters are a testament to the respondent's general character and legal skills.\n\n\n        \"32.     Imposition of Other Penalties or Sanctions. The respondent's licenses to practice\nlaw in Florida, Colorado, and Montana have each been suspended.\n\n\n        \"33.     In addition to the above-cited factors, the hearing panel has thoroughly examined\nand considered the following Standards:\n\n\n        '4.12    Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows or\n                 should know that he is dealing improperly with client property\n                 and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\n\n\n        '4.42    Suspension is generally appropriate when:\n\n\n                 (a)       a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for\n                           a client and causes injury or potential injury to a\n                           client; or\n                 (b)       a lawyer engages in a pattern of neglect and\n                           causes injury or potential injury to a client.\n\n\n        '4.62    Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly\n                 deceives a client, and causes injury or potential injury to the\n                 client.\n\n\n        '7.2     Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly\n                 engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a\n                 professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the\n                 public, or the legal system.'\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f                                                \"Recommendation\n\n\n               \"34.    The disciplinary administrator recommended that the respondent be suspended\n       for a period of 91 days. The respondent joined the disciplinary administrator's recommendation\n       for reciprocal discipline of a 91 day suspension. The respondent, however, argued that he should\n       be given credit for the period of suspension that he has served and continues to serve in Florida.\n\n\n               \"35.    The hearing panel agrees that a 91 day suspension is in order in this case. Thus,\n       based upon the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the Standards listed above, the hearing\n       panel unanimously recommends that the respondent be suspended for a period of 91 days.\n       However, because the respondent's practice was located in Florida and has no Kansas clients, the\n       hearing panel believes that the respondent's reinstatement in Kansas should be tied to his\n       reinstatement in Florida. Accordingly, the hearing panel recommends that before the respondent\n       be allowed to practice in Kansas, he be required to satisfy the disciplinary administrator that he is\n       a lawyer in good standing reinstated to practice law in the State of Florida. The hearing panel is\n       trying to ensure that in no event will the respondent be allowed to practice in Kansas, if he is not\n       allowed to practice in Florida. See In re Joslin, 270 Kan. 419, 424 (2000).\n\n\n               \"36.    Costs are assessed against the respondent in an amount to be certified by the\n       Office of the Disciplinary Administrator.\"\n\n\n                                              DISCUSSION\n\n\n       In a disciplinary proceeding, this court considers the evidence, the findings of the\ndisciplinary panel, and the arguments of the parties and determines whether violations of\nKRPC exist and, if they do, what discipline should be imposed. Attorney misconduct\nmust be established by clear and convincing evidence. In re Foster, 292 Kan. 940, 945,\n258 P.3d 375 (2011); see Supreme Court Rule 211(f) (2015 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 350).\nClear and convincing evidence is \"'evidence that causes the factfinder to believe that \"the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    24\n\ftruth of the facts asserted is highly probable.\"'\" In re Lober, 288 Kan. 498, 505, 204 P.3d\n610 (2009) (quoting In re Dennis, 286 Kan. 708, 725, 188 P.3d 1 [2008]).\n\n\n       Respondent was given adequate notice of the formal complaint, to which he filed\nan answer, and adequate notice of the hearing before the panel and the hearing before this\ncourt. The respondent did not file exceptions to the hearing panel's final hearing reports.\nAs such, the findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c) and (d)\n(2015 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 369).\n\n\n       The evidence before the hearing panel establishes by clear and convincing\nevidence the charged misconduct violated KRPC 1.2(a) (2015 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 456)\n(scope of representation); 1.3 (2015 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 461) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2015\nKan. Ct. R. Annot. 482) (communication); 1.15(d) (2015 Kan. Ct. R.

Annot. 672) (engaging in conduct\ninvolving misrepresentation); and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice), and it supports the panel's conclusions of law. We adopt the\npanel's conclusions.\n\n\n       The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for respondent's\nviolations. At the hearing before the panel, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator\nand respondent recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in\nthe state of Kansas for a period of 91 days. The hearing panel agreed that the appropriate\ndiscipline is a 91-day suspension. The panel further recommended that before the\nrespondent be allowed to practice in Kansas, he be required to satisfy the Disciplinary\nAdministrator that he is a lawyer in good standing reinstated to practice law in the state of\nFlorida.\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       As stated in the final hearing report, respondent is not only licensed to practice law\nin Kansas and Florida, but also in the states of Montana and Colorado. The Colorado\nSupreme Court suspended respondent for 91 days as of December 15, 2014. The\nMontana Supreme Court suspended him for 91 days as of February 26, 2015.\n\n\n       At the hearing before this court, at which the respondent appeared, the office of\nthe Disciplinary Administrator recommended that respondent be suspended from the\npractice of law in the state of Kansas for a period of 91 days. Respondent recommended\nthat he be suspended from the practice of law in the state of Kansas for a period of 91\ndays retroactive to the date of the Florida suspension. Further respondent requested that\nwhen he is reinstated in Florida, he be deemed reinstated in Kansas.\n\n\n       We hold that respondent is to be suspended from the practice of law in the state of\nKansas as of the date of this order until such time as he has satisfied the Disciplinary\nAdministrator that he is a lawyer in good standing reinstated to practice law in the state of\nFlorida. Further, after the state of Florida reinstates him in good standing, he may take the\nnecessary steps to change his status from inactive to active in Kansas.\n\n\n                                CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n\n\n       IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Charles P.

In or around August 2010,\n               respondent was hired to represent [E.D.] in a dissolution of marriage\n               proceeding. [E.D.]'s fees were paid by his friend, [C.C.], by credit card in\n               two separate payments, one in the amount of $2,500.00 for attorney fees,\n                                                    2\n\fand the other in the amount of $500.00 for costs. These funds were\nplaced in an account Respondent referred to as his cost account. During\nthe pendency of the matter, in or around December 2010, Respondent\ndisbursed $75.00 of the cost funds for the services of a court reporter.\nThere was no testimony presented that respondent removed his fees,\nwhich were non-refundable, from the cost account within a reasonable\ntime period and there was no testimony presented that any other costs\nwere incurred.\n\n\n        \"The trial in the [E.D.] matter was scheduled for April 11, 2011.\nOne of the matters of utmost importance to [E.D.] was that a court\nreporter be present for the trial. However, neither respondent nor his staff\nscheduled a court reporter and a court reporter was not present. The\nparties eventually reached a settlement agreement, the terms of which\nwere presented to the trial judge.\n\n\n        \"Opposing counsel prepared the proposed final judgment and\nforwarded it to respondent for review. Respondent requested that\nopposing counsel add a paragraph addressing the minor child's school\nattendance and issues related to tardiness. Other than that change, the\nevidence established that respondent sought no other changes to the\nproposed order and opposing counsel forwarded it to the trial court.\nThereafter, respondent's office forwarded the proposed final judgment to\n[E.D.] for his review. Upon receipt of the proposed final judgment,\n[E.D.] immediately notified respondent by email and then spoke with his\nstaff the next day, informing respondent and his staff that the proposed\nfinal judgment contained errors and that respondent should not allow the\njudge to sign the order as drafted. There was no evidence presented that\nrespondent attempted to address the matter at that time with opposing\ncounsel or the court. The trial court issued the final judgment, which was\nnot consistent with the agreement between the parties, on May 9, 2011.\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\f          \"Once [E.D.] received the signed final judgment, he notified\nrespondent the order had not been corrected and that he wanted it to\ncorrectly reflect the parties' agreement. In an email, [E.D.] again pointed\nout his issues of concern and the fact that he had specifically requested\nthat respondent stop the judge from signing the proposed final judgment\nbecause it did not reflect the agreement of the parties. While the evidence\nindicated there was some contact between opposing counsel and\nrespondent's staff regarding the incorrect order, there was no testimony\nor evidence presented indicating respondent attempted to address the\nmatter.\n\n\n          \"An amended final judgment was submitted for the trial court's\nreview. However, the correction made was of no significance to [E.D.].\nThe correction failed to address the child visitation and/or child support\nissues that [E.D.] had raised with respondent. Rather, the only correction\nmade was more of a typographical correction, as testified to by opposing\ncounsel, as it simply omitted a paragraph that had been placed in the\nproposed final judgment in error. The omitted paragraph indicated the\nparties had entered into a written settlement agreement when in fact the\nparties had reached an oral settlement agreement. The amended final\njudgment, which was entered on June 8, 2011, reflected the removal of\nthat paragraph.\n\n\n          \"As before, upon receipt of the incorrect amended final\njudgment, [E.D.] immediately notified respondent via email, in a rather\ndirect fashion, that none of his issues of concern had been addressed. He\ndemanded that respondent 'fix it.' In addition to the concerns related to\nchild visitation and child support, [E.D.] also notified respondent that the\nbilling invoice he had received contained double billings and other\nbilling items that he questioned. In his correspondence to respondent,\n[E.D.] made it clear that once the order was corrected to reflect the\nagreement between the parties, then the issues regarding the billing\nwould be discussed. However, the evidence presented failed to show that\n\n                                     4\n\frespondent and/or his staff addressed the billing concerns raised by\n[E.D.].\n\n\n          \"At or around the end of August 2011, respondent forwarded a\ncorrected amended final judgment to [E.D.] for his review. In separate\ncorrespondence respondent also notified [E.D.] that he had a duty to pay\nrespondent's outstanding attorney's fees and that if [E.D.] failed to do so,\nrespondent would pursue all collection avenues available to him. The\namount respondent notified [E.D.] he owed included the items for which\n[E.D.] had been double billed. Shortly thereafter, [E.D.] notified the\nrespondent the corrected amended final judgment reflected the agreement\nbetween the parties. He also specifically outlined the issues he had with\nrespondent's billing invoice and indicated that he believed he owed\nrespondent substantially less than respondent was invoicing. In addition,\nhe forwarded a $50.00 check, explaining that was the amount he would\nbe able to pay respondent each month until respondent was paid in full.\nRespondent cashed the check. However, he failed to file the corrected\namended final judgment and he failed to notify [E.D.] he would not agree\nto being paid only $50.00 a month.\n\n\n          \"The evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrated respondent\nfailed to correct or address the billing issues. Likewise, the evidence\nclearly and convincingly demonstrated while respondent cashed [E.D.]'s\n$50.00 check, respondent had no desire to enter into a payment plan with\n[E.D.], especially in an amount of only $50.00 per month and that\nrespondent failed to address this issue with [E.D.]. Further the evidence\nclearly demonstrated respondent made a conscious decision at that time\nthat he would not file the corrected amended final judgment until and\nunless he received the remainder of his representation fee.\n\n\n          \"The evidence also established that [E.D.] failed to make any\nfurther payments to respondent. [E.D.] testified that he did not pay\nanything further because respondent failed to complete the representation\n\n                                     5\n\fby filing the corrected amended judgment with the court. [E.D.] was\nclear that he believed respondent had a duty to complete the matter and\nthat he was not going to pay until respondent performed the services for\nwhich he had been hired. The evidence further established that\nrespondent did not take any steps to follow up on the matter nor did he\nmove to withdraw.\n\n\n          \"Thereafter, in or around January 2012, respondent forwarded\n[E.D.]'s file to a collection agency. Based upon the invoices entered into\nevidence and the testimony presented, respondent had not addressed the\ndouble billing issues prior to sending the matter to collections.\nConsequently, the collection agency was attempting to recover all funds\non respondent's behalf, including funds that had been improperly double-\nbilled.\n\n\n          \"[E.D.] then sought recourse through the Better Business Bureau\nby filing a complaint in or around March 2012. He complained about\nrespondent's conduct as [well] as the billing issues. It was only after\n[E.D.] had to resort to contacting the Better Business Bureau that\nrespondent finally addressed the double billing issue. However, in\nresponding to same, he implied that while he had corrected the billing\nissues, [E.D.] still refused to pay the fees owed. Upon review of the\nevidence, it is clear that the same day respondent responded to the Better\nBusiness Bureau is the same day he corrected his billing invoices. As\nsuch, the implication being made by respondent in his response to the\nBetter Business Bureau was less than forthright. In addition to the\nforegoing, respondent also invoiced [E.D.] for the time spent addressing\nthe Better Business Bureau complaint and did not remove the charge\nfrom the billing invoices until after The Florida Bar became involved.\nThe evidence presented in this regard demonstrated that respondent\neither failed to review the billing invoices in timely manner and address\nthe error, or he simply refused to do so because he was not being paid.\n\n\n                                     6\n\f        \"However, respondent engaged in other, more serious\nmisconduct than that discussed above. The evidence showed clearly and\nconvincingly that respondent applied the remaining $425.00 of cost\nfunds he received to pay a portion of his attorney's fees and that he did\nnot receive his client's permission to do so. Respondent and his assistant\ntestified that the cost funds were always in the cost account. The other\nevidence presented, which consisted of the billing invoices and a ledger\ncard, which was prepared manually and at a much later date does not\nsupport respondent's nor his assistant's position in that regard. The ledger\ncard does not comport with respondent's billing invoices and contains\nerrors. When questioned about why the cost funds were not segregated\non the invoices and why invoices always showed that the entire retainer\npaid was applied, neither respondent nor his assistant provided a credible\nanswer. For example, on the April 11, 2011, invoice prepared by\nrespondent's office, the total amount of attorney's fees incurred was\n$5,398.50. The total disbursement (for the court reporter) was $75.00.\nThus, the invoice indicates the total fee and disbursements equaled\n$5,473.50, less the retainers applied of $3,000.00 for a balance due of\n$2,473.50. Lastly, the invoice lists the payment detail noting attorney\nfees of 2500/costs 500 for total payments of $3000.00. . . .\n\n\n        \"Respondent and his assistant testified that the program simply\nworked that way and there was nothing that could be done. They testified\nthat there was no way to ensure that the invoices the clients received\naccurately reflected how the payments were actually made. In essence,\nwhat respondent and his assistant testified to was that despite what the\ninvoices stated, respondent did not use the remaining $425.00 towards\nhis attorney's fees. This referee finds this testimony by respondent and\nhis assistant lacking in credibility. Moreover, if respondent is to be\nbelieved, he did nothing to ensure that there was some type of\nnotification to his clients the cost funds being held by respondent were\nnot being used towards his attorney's fees. The invoices respondent\nprovided to his clients clearly stated otherwise and the position espoused\n\n                                     7\n\fby respondent, that there was simply nothing that could be done to\naccurately reflect how the funds paid by a client is disbursed, is\nuntenable.\n\n\n           \"The evidence and testimony presented in this regard clearly and\nconvincingly established that respondent used the cost funds for a\npurpose other than that for which the funds had been provided. The\nevidence also clearly and convincingly established that respondent knew\nlittle about how the system worked. Likewise, the evidence and\ntestimony clearly and convincingly demonstrated that respondent left the\nbilling issues up to his non-lawyer staff and that he had little to do with\nit. This referee did not find that respondent's lack of knowledge and/or\ninterest in how his billing system worked to be a valid excuse for the\nmanner in which the cost funds were handled. Respondent's conduct was\nnot a mere technical violation of the trust rules and was disturbing to this\nreferee.\n\n\n           \"Respondent similarly failed to properly and forthrightly address\nthe issues related to the hiring of the court reporter. The evidence clearly\nestablished that a court reporter was not present at the dissolution trial on\nApril 11, 2011, despite the fact [E.D.] had been emphatic that a court\nreporter was to be present for all court proceedings. In one piece of\ncorrespondence to [E.D.], respondent stated that a court reporter was\npresent, but that since there was no trial, there was nothing for the court\nreporter to monitor. On the other hand, in response to [E.D.]\napproximately one year later, respondent stated that he had a court\nreporter on standby, but that he did not want to get stuck with the court\nreporter's bills like he had been stuck with his attorney's fees. This later\nresponse is clearly suspect.\n\n\n           \"There was no credible evidence presented during the final\nhearing that, at the time of the trial in the [E.D.] dissolution matter,\nrespondent had notified [E.D.] he owed additional attorneys fees, [E.D.]\n\n                                       8\n\fhad been presented with an invoice showing he owed additional\nattorney's fees, or [E.D.] had refused to pay any additional attorney's\nfees. Rather, the evidence established that respondent had been away on\nvacation and that he failed to obtain a court reporter and that his staff had\neither not been instructed to obtain a court reporter or had failed to do so.\nThe evidence presented by respondent that he may have had or may have\nattempted to have a court reporter on standby was not sufficiently clear\nor supported by other testimony and evidence presented. This referee\nfound respondent's testimony and insistence that he could have had a\ncourt reporter present self-serving and lacking in credibility.\n\n\n        \"And finally, a grave concern to this referee was respondent's\nfailure to submit the corrected amended final judgment to the trial court\nuntil some two years after the incorrect amended final judgment had\nbeen issued. Again, respondent did nothing to address this matter until\nafter the bar's involvement. Further, the evidence established respondent\nfailed to notify [E.D.] when he finally submitted the corrected amended\nfinal judgment to the trial court. By the time respondent filed the\ncorrected amended final judgment and the trial court entered the order on\nJuly 23, 2013, nunc pro tunc to April 11, 2011, the parties involved have\nbeen forced to live with an incorrect order for more than two years. This\nreferee finds this to be an intolerable breach of ethics.\n\n\n        \"Respondent's testimony in regard to his failure to complete\n[E.D.]'s matter was especially troubling to this referee. Respondent fully\nrecognized that his client's matter was not resolved due to respondent's\nlack of diligence and that his failure in this regard required his client to\nlive with an incorrect order that harmed his client. Respondent made a\nconscious decision to hold his client's matter 'hostage' until he was paid.\nRespondent testified that if his client had just paid him a 'little more' he\nwould have completed the matter and written the fees off. However,\nrespondent's testimony is not credible and is clearly belied by his actual\nconduct. Respondent did absolutely nothing to fulfill his obligations to\n\n                                      9\n\fhis client because he allowed his own interests, that being paid, to over-\nride his professional and ethical duty to his client.\n\n\n        \"The evidence presented in this matter, by way of testimony and\nexhibits, clearly and convincingly established that respondent failed to\nabide by his client's decisions, that he failed to act diligently for his\nclient, that he failed to properly and adequately communicate with his\nclient, that he made misrepresentations to his client, that he used cost\nfunds improperly, and that he harmed not only his client for his own\ngain, but in doing so, he also harmed the judicial system and our\nprofession.\n\n\n\"III.

STANDARDS FOR IMPOSING LAWYER SANCTIONS\n\n\n        \"I considered the following factors prior to recommending\ndiscipline: the duty violated, the lawyer's mental state, the potential or\nactual injury caused by respondent's misconduct, and the existence of\nmitigating and aggravating circumstances.

Finally, I considered the fact that the Court\nhas moved toward stronger sanctions for attorney misconduct in recent\nyears. The Florida Bar v.

Counsel on behalf\nof respondent argued the only two aggravating factors applicable in this\ncase were 9.22(d) multiple offenses (due to the fact numerous rule\nviolations were found) and 9.22(i) substantial experience in the practice\nof law.\n\n\n          \"In mitigation, the bar acknowledged that 9.32(a) absence of a\nprior disciplinary record and 9.32(g) character or reputation were\napplicable in this matter. Respondent argued that not only were 9.32(a)\nand 9.32(g) applicable, but that 9.32(b) absence of dishonest or selfish\nmotive; 9.32(c) personal or emotional problems; and 9.32(e) full and free\ndisclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward\nproceedings; and 9.32(l) remorse also applied.\n\n\n          \"After careful consideration of the aggravating factors as applied\nto the facts before me and the arguments made by the bar and\nrespondent, I find not only were the aggravating factors of 9.22(b),\n9.22(d), 9.22(h) and 9.22(i), applicable in this matter, but I also find\naggravating factor 9.22(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of\nconduct applies.\n\n                                     12\n\f        \"I find the mitigating factors for 9.32(a), 9.32(e) and 9.32(g)\nwere demonstrated in this case. However, I did not find respondent\nlacked a selfish or dishonest motive [9.32(b)], nor did I find he\ndemonstrated he suffered from personal or emotional problems [9.32(c)],\nand finally I did not find respondent demonstrated remorse [9.32(l)].\n\n\n        \"In regard to the finding that these three mitigating factors are\nnot applicable in this case, this referee determined respondent displayed\ndishonesty and selfishness. He made misrepresentations to his client, he\nused cost funds improperly, and he clearly placed his own interests above\nthose of his client's. Further, the limited evidence presented during the\nhearing does not support a determination [sic] respondent's personal\nmatters (he was engaged in personal post-dissolution proceedings) were\nso consuming and/or overwhelming that he could not reasonably fulfill\nhis obligations to his client. Furthermore, if the nature of respondent's\npersonal problems were such that he could not provide reasonable,\ncompetent, diligent representation to his client, then respondent had a\nduty to notify this client that he was unable to fulfill his obligations and\nassist his client in finding another attorney. And finally, while respondent\nexpressed remorse during a mitigation hearing, and while he apologized\nto the referee, the legal profession, and his client, this referee found the\napology insufficient and untimely. Moreover, there was no evidence\npresented that respondent had actually apologized to his client for failing\nto timely address his matters, for failing to properly communicate, for\nfailing to abide by his client's instructions to have a court reporter\npresent, and for forcing his client to seek assistance to the Better\nBusiness Bureau and The Florida Bar. Apologizing in a setting in which\nthe client was not present is of little consequence.\n\n\n        \"In this case, respondent, in essence, held his client's matter\nhostage in an effort to force his client to pay respondent's outstanding\nattorney's fees. The respondent clearly put his interests before those of\n\n                                     13\n\fhis client and his actions were knowing and deliberate. In determining\nthat respondent refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his\nconduct, this referee is mindful of the numerous opportunities respondent\nhad to address his client's concerns and the fact he failed to do so.\n\n\n        \"In addition to the foregoing, I also considered the following\nStandards argued by the parties: 4.12 (suspension is appropriate when a\nlawyer knows or should know that he is dealing improperly with client\nproperty and causes injury or potential injury to a client); 4.14\n(admonishment is appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in dealing with\nclient property and causes little or no actual or potential injury to a client\nor where there is a technical violation of the trust account rules or where\nthere is an unintentional mishandling of client property); 4.42(a)\n(suspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly fails to perform\nservices for a client and causes injury or potential injury to a client); 4.62\n(suspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly deceives a client,\nand causes injury or potential injury to a client); and 7.2 (suspension is\nappropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a\nviolation of a duty owed as a professional and causes injury or potential\ninjury to a client, the public, or the legal system).\n\n\n        \"Respondent argued that his conduct in this case was an\naberration and that the testimony of his character witnesses, which\nincluded but was not limited to, judges and other attorneys, supported\nhim in this regard. He additionally argued that the mishandling of the\ncost funds was unintentional and that once errors (such as the\noverbilling) were pointed out to him, the errors were corrected. He also\nargued [E.D.] was not actually harmed because the [sic] he and his ex-\nwife were not abiding by the court's order and had not been. Further,\nrespondent argued he was simply attempting to be paid for the services\nhe had rendered, and that no misrepresentations had been made. And\nfinally, respondent argued that the strength of his mitigation, which\nincluded not only his character and reputation, but also the fact he had\n\n                                      14\n\fbeen a practicing attorney for 27 years without a blemish, he is a death-\nqualified attorney, he founded the local chapter of the Florida\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers and remains on the Board of\nDirectors, and he provides numerous services to his local community as\ntestified to by Dr. Douglas Alexander, supports a sanction of, at most, a\npublic reprimand.\n\n\n        \"The bar, on the other hand, argued the facts demonstrated\nrespondent engaged in knowing, intentional misconduct, that he placed\nhis interests above those of his client's and that his failure to act\ndiligently created a situation in which [E.D.] chose to disobey the\ndictates of the court's order because it was incorrect. The bar also argued\nrespondent took little interest in correcting billing errors or attempting to\nwork with [E.D.] to address his most significant concerns. The bar\nfurther argued respondent failed to abide by [E.D.]'s instructions and then\npresented a less than forthright explanation to [E.D.] for his failure to do\nso. Finally, the bar argued respondent misused client cost funds by\npaying them to himself to offset attorney's fees. Therefore, the bar argued\nthat, despite the significant mitigation shown, the egregious nature of the\nmisconduct engaged in by respondent warranted a rehabilitative\nsuspension.\n\n\n        \"In determining respondent was guilty of the rule violations\nlisted previously in this report, this Referee determined respondent's\nconduct was intentional and that the bar had met its burden in that regard.\nSee, The Florida Bar v. Fredericks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1847186\"><a href=\"/opinion/1847186/the-florida-bar-v-fredericks/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1999).\nRespondent had been notified timely by [E.D.] on more than one\noccasion that the order, as issued by the trial court, was incorrect. He had\nbeen told by [E.D.] that the visitation issues, which were of paramount\nimportance to [E.D.], were not what he had agreed to and that he\ndefinitely wanted the order [sic] be fixed because he had already missed\ntime with his child. Respondent was timely notified of the billing errors\nwhich went unaddressed by respondent until [E.D.] was forced to seek\n\n                                      15\n\fthe assistance of the Better Business Bureau. Respondent improperly\nused client cost funds and failed to rectify the situation until after the\nbar's involvement. In addition, respondent's testimony in regard to the\nhiring of a court reporter, which was also very important to [E.D.], was\nsuspect.\n\n\n           \"But, more importantly, respondent intentionally and deliberately\nheld onto the corrected amended final judgment in an effort to force\npayment from [E.D.]. Respondent's conduct caused [E.D.] to live with an\nincorrect order for a period of two years, simply because respondent\nchose to put his interests before those of his client. Respondent\ndeliberately acted in a manner that placed our system of justice in\njeopardy. The lynch-pin of our legal system is that individuals adhere to\nthe orders issued by our courts. Respondent knew the order was incorrect\nand that it had a negative impact upon his client, yet he did nothing and\nthen attempted to justify his misconduct by arguing that his client was\nnot abiding by the order anyway. This referee finds respondent's conduct\nin this regard and his attempt at justification to be especially egregious.\nThis referee finds the following statement by the Supreme Court of\nFlorida in The Florida Bar v. Varner, 992 So.224, 231 (Fla. 2008)\nespecially applicable in this case: '[t]he profession of the practice of law\nrequires lawyers to be honest, competent, and diligent in their dealings\nwith clients, other lawyers, and courts. Clients expect no less from their\nlawyers and place great trust in lawyers in their times of need. Lawyers\ntrust each other to accurately represent their clients' interests and courts\ntrust lawyers to do the same.' Respondent failed to live up to the ethical\nstandards expected of attorneys in Florida.\n\n\n           ....\n\n\n           \". . . This referee is mindful of the fact that a recommendation of\na rehabilitative suspension is consequential and that if imposed will have\na significant impact on respondent. Likewise, this referee is mindful of\n\n                                       16\n\fthe fact that respondent has no prior discipline history and that the\ntestimony and letters provided in mitigation support a determination is\n[sic] his well thought of in his legal community and his community at\nlarge. Nevertheless, respondent engaged in intentional, knowing,\ndeliberate misconduct. He made misrepresentations, he mishandled client\ncost funds by applying them to his attorney's fees, he deliberately failed\nto finish his client's matter, despite knowing the order, as issued by the\ntrial court was in error, solely because he had not been paid, and he failed\nto properly and adequately communicate and address issues with his\nclient. This referee finds the misconduct in this case to be extremely\nserious and conduct that cannot and should not be tolerated. However,\nthis referee does not find that respondent's misconduct warrants a one\nyear suspension like that imposed in Varner and Centurion, but rather,\nthat a ninety-one day rehabilitative suspension is appropriate.\n\n\n\"VI.    RECOMMENDATION AS TO DISCIPLINARY MEASURES\n        TO BE APPLIED\n\n\n        \"I recommend that Respondent be found guilty of misconduct\njustifying disciplinary measures, and that [sic] be disciplined by:\n\n\n        \"A.

The respondent's suspension in Florida began October 26, 2014. To date, the\nrespondent has not applied for reinstatement in Florida.\n\n\n        \"11.      Thereafter, Colorado and Montana imposed reciprocal discipline. On December\n15, 2014, the Supreme Court of Colorado suspended the respondent's license to practice law in\nthat state for 91 days. The respondent's license to practice law in Colorado will automatically be\nreinstated once the respondent is reinstated in Florida. The Supreme Court of Montana also\nsuspended the respondent's license to practice law in that state for 91 days.\n\n\n                                        \"Conclusions of Law\n\n\n        \"12.      Based upon Kan. Sup. Ct.

R. 202 provides, in part, as follows: 'A final adjudication in\nanother jurisdiction that a lawyer has been guilty of misconduct shall establish conclusively the\nmisconduct for purposes of a disciplinary proceeding in this state.' In this case, Florida, Colorado,\nand Montana entered final adjudications that the respondent was guilty of misconduct in those\njurisdictions. Thus, the evidence of those final adjudications is conclusive evidence for purposes\nof this disciplinary proceeding.\n\n\n                                            \"KRPC 1.2(a)\n\n\n        \"14.

In this case, the respondent violated KRPC 1.2(a) when he\n\n                                             18\n\ffailed to file the corrected amended final judgment.

The respondent failed to diligently and promptly represent [E.D.].\nThe respondent failed to promptly prepare and file a corrected amended final judgment. As the\nFlorida referee pointed out, the respondent's lack of diligence caused his client to violate a court's\norder for 2 years. Because the respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness\nin representing his client, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.3.\n\n\n                                              \"KRPC 1.4(a)\n\n\n        \"16.

The only discipline received by the\nrespondent previously was based upon the instant facts. The States of Florida, Colorado, and\nMontana each suspended the respondent for a period of 91 days. Additionally, the State of Florida\nrequired the respondent to establish that he has been rehabilitated, prior to reinstatement. Finally,\nthe respondent is not eligible for reinstatement in Colorado until his license in Florida is\nreinstated.\n\n\n        \"30.     The Present and Past Attitude of the Attorney as Shown by His or Her\nCooperation During the Hearing and His or Her Full and Free Acknowledgment of the\nTransgressions. The respondent fully cooperated with the disciplinary process. Additionally, the\nrespondent stipulated to the facts and rule violations.\n\n\n        \"31.     Previous Good Character and Reputation in the Community Including Any\nLetters from Clients, Friends and Lawyers in Support of the Character and General Reputation of\nthe Attorney. Prior to the misconduct in this case, the respondent was an active and productive\nmember of the bar of Florida. The respondent also enjoyed the respect of his peers and generally\n\n\n                                             22\n\fpossesses a good character and reputation as evidenced by several letters received by the hearing\npanel. These letters are a testament to the respondent's general character and legal skills.\n\n\n        \"32.     Imposition of Other Penalties or Sanctions. The respondent's licenses to practice\nlaw in Florida, Colorado, and Montana have each been suspended.\n\n\n        \"33.     In addition to the above-cited factors, the hearing panel has thoroughly examined\nand considered the following Standards:\n\n\n        '4.12    Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows or\n                 should know that he is dealing improperly with client property\n                 and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\n\n\n        '4.42    Suspension is generally appropriate when:\n\n\n                 (a)       a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for\n                           a client and causes injury or potential injury to a\n                           client; or\n                 (b)       a lawyer engages in a pattern of neglect and\n                           causes injury or potential injury to a client.\n\n\n        '4.62    Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly\n                 deceives a client, and causes injury or potential injury to the\n                 client.\n\n\n        '7.2     Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly\n                 engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a\n                 professional, and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the\n                 public, or the legal system.'\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f                                                \"Recommendation\n\n\n               \"34.    The disciplinary administrator recommended that the respondent be suspended\n       for a period of 91 days. The respondent joined the disciplinary administrator's recommendation\n       for reciprocal discipline of a 91 day suspension. The respondent, however, argued that he should\n       be given credit for the period of suspension that he has served and continues to serve in Florida.\n\n\n               \"35.    The hearing panel agrees that a 91 day suspension is in order in this case. Thus,\n       based upon the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the Standards listed above, the hearing\n       panel unanimously recommends that the respondent be suspended for a period of 91 days.\n       However, because the respondent's practice was located in Florida and has no Kansas clients, the\n       hearing panel believes that the respondent's reinstatement in Kansas should be tied to his\n       reinstatement in Florida. Accordingly, the hearing panel recommends that before the respondent\n       be allowed to practice in Kansas, he be required to satisfy the disciplinary administrator that he is\n       a lawyer in good standing reinstated to practice law in the State of Florida. The hearing panel is\n       trying to ensure that in no event will the respondent be allowed to practice in Kansas, if he is not\n       allowed to practice in Florida.

The respondent did not file exceptions to the hearing panel's final hearing reports.\nAs such, the findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c) and (d)\n(2015 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 369).\n\n\n       The evidence before the hearing panel establishes by clear and convincing\nevidence the charged misconduct violated KRPC 1.2(a) (2015 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 456)\n(scope of representation); 1.3 (2015 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 461) (diligence); 1.4(a) (2015\nKan. Ct. R. Annot. 482) (communication); 1.15(d) (2015 Kan. Ct. R.

Annot. 672) (engaging in conduct\ninvolving misrepresentation); and 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice), and it supports the panel's conclusions of law. We adopt the\npanel's conclusions.\n\n\n       The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for respondent's\nviolations. At the hearing before the panel, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator\nand respondent recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in\nthe state of Kansas for a period of 91 days. The hearing panel agreed that the appropriate\ndiscipline is a 91-day suspension. The panel further recommended that before the\nrespondent be allowed to practice in Kansas, he be required to satisfy the Disciplinary\nAdministrator that he is a lawyer in good standing reinstated to practice law in the state of\nFlorida.\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       As stated in the final hearing report, respondent is not only licensed to practice law\nin Kansas and Florida, but also in the states of Montana and Colorado. The Colorado\nSupreme Court suspended respondent for 91 days as of December 15, 2014. The\nMontana Supreme Court suspended him for 91 days as of February 26, 2015.\n\n\n       At the hearing before this court, at which the respondent appeared, the office of\nthe Disciplinary Administrator recommended that respondent be suspended from the\npractice of law in the state of Kansas for a period of 91 days. Respondent recommended\nthat he be suspended from the practice of law in the state of Kansas for a period of 91\ndays retroactive to the date of the Florida suspension. Further respondent requested that\nwhen he is reinstated in Florida, he be deemed reinstated in Kansas.\n\n\n       We hold that respondent is to be suspended from the practice of law in the state of\nKansas as of the date of this order until such time as he has satisfied the Disciplinary\nAdministrator that he is a lawyer in good standing reinstated to practice law in the state of\nFlorida. Further, after the state of Florida reinstates him in good standing, he may take the\nnecessary steps to change his status from inactive to active in Kansas.\n\n\n                                CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n\n\n       IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Charles P. Vaughn be and is hereby disciplined by\nsuspension from the practice of law in the state of Kansas, in accordance with Supreme\nCourt Rule 203(a)(2) (2015 Kan. Ct. R. Annot. 293), as of the date of this order until such\ntime as he satisfies the Disciplinary Administrator that he is a lawyer in good standing\nreinstated to practice law in the state of Florida. Further, after the State of Florida\nreinstates him in good standing, he may take the necessary steps to change his status from\ninactive to active in Kansas.\n\n\n                                              26\n\f      IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the costs of these proceedings be assessed to the\nrespondent and that this opinion be published in the official Kansas Reports.\n\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\f</pre>",
