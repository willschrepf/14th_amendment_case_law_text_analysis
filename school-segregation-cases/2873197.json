We will affirm.\n\n               While Diaz was incarcerated at the Golden Grove Correctional Facility in St.\n\nCroix, Virgin Islands, prison officials charged him with violating prison regulations by\n\nrepeatedly stabbing another inmate with a knife. The Bureau of Corrections Disciplinary\n\nCommittee held a hearing after which it found Diaz guilty of violating prison regulations and\n\nplaced him in administrative segregation for fifty-five days. For the stabbing, the Government\n\nthen charged Diaz with assault in the third degree and with possession of a dangerous weapon.\n\nDiaz filed a motion to dismiss, which the Territorial Court denied. He went to trial and was\n\nfound guilty on both counts.\n\n               Diaz argues that because he had already been tried and sanctioned by prison\n\nofficials for the stabbing, the Government’s attempt to prosecute him violated the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. His argument is foreclosed by our decision in United\n\nStates v. Newby, 11 F.3d 1143 (3d Cir. 1993). In Newby, we held that “a prison disciplinary\n\nhearing is not a prosecution for Double Jeopardy Clause purposes. Disciplinary sanctions\n\nimposed by prison authorities for infractions of prison regulations do not bar a subsequent\n\ncriminal prosecution.” Id. at 1144 (citation omitted). Other Courts of Appeal to address the\n\nissue are in agreement. See United States v. Galan, 82 F.3d 639, 640 (5th Cir. 1996); United\n\nStates v. Brown, 59 F.3d 102, 105 (9th Cir. 1995); United States v. Hernandez-Fundora, 58 F.3d\n\n                                                2\n\f802, 807 (2d Cir. 1995); United States v. Rising, 867 F.2d 1255, 1259 (10th Cir. 1989); Kerns v.\n\nParatt, 672 F.2d 690 (8th Cir. 1982). Thus, Diaz’s argument fails as a matter of law.\n\n              Accordingly, we affirm the Territorial Court’s order denying the motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\f",
