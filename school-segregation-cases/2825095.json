EIG & ASSO-\nCIATES, P.C., Chevy Chase, Maryland, for Appellees.\n\n\n\n                             OPINION\n\nGREGORY, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Kenneth Lawson, in his capacity as Superintendent of the Anne\nArundel County Public Schools (\"AACPS\"), and the Board of Educa-\ntion of Anne Arundel County appeal from a judgment of the United\nStates District Court for the District of Maryland (Bredar, M.J.),\nentered under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., ordering payment of reimburse-\nment to the parent of a learning disabled child for two years’ tuition\nat a private school. The district court concluded that such reimburse-\nment was necessary because AACPS denied AB a free appropriate\npublic education (\"FAPE\").\n\n    AACPS and the student’s mother, DB, had engaged in a protracted\ndispute as to the nature and extent of AB’s learning disability. An\nadministrative law judge held that AACPS formulated an Individual-\nized Education Program (\"IEP\") for the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002\nschool years that was reasonably calculated to provide AB with a\nFAPE under IDEA. The district court reversed the ALJ’s ruling and\ngranted summary judgment for the Bs. The lower court held that AB\nhad not been provided a FAPE, and AACPS was obligated to reim-\nburse DB for two years of private school education. Because, as\nexplained below, AACPS complied with IDEA and formulated an\nIEP reasonably calculated to provide AB with some educational bene-\nfit, we reverse the district court and direct that summary judgment be\nentered for Appellants. We also vacate the district court’s order inso-\nfar as it ordered AACPS to reimburse plaintiffs for AB’s placement\nat the Summit School for the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school years.\n\f                            A.B. v. LAWSON                             3\n                                   I.\n\n                                   A.\n\n   This case involves the application of IDEA, a statute designed to\nprovide free appropriate educational services to millions of children\nwith learning disabilities in the United States. 20 U.S.C.A. § 1400.\nOne of Congress’ primary purposes in enacting IDEA in 1990 was \"to\nensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a\n[FAPE] that emphasizes special education and related services\ndesigned to meet their unique needs . . . .\" 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A);\nsee also MM ex rel. DM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 303 F.3d\n523, 526 (4th Cir. 2002).1 To receive federal funding under IDEA, the\nstate must provide all children with disabilities a FAPE. 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1400(c), 1412(a)(1). A FAPE requires the school district to pro-\nvide instruction that suits the child’s needs as well as related services\nto ensure that the child receives some educational benefit from\ninstruction. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(8); see also Md. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-\n402(a)(3) (defining FAPE); 20 U.S.C. § 1401(22) (defining related\nservices).\n\n   Under the act, the state must provide children with \"meaningful\naccess\" to public education. Bd. of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch.\nDist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 192 (1982). The FAPE must only be\n\"calculated to confer some educational benefit on a disabled child.\"\nMM, 303 F.3d at 526 (citing Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207) (emphasis\nadded). The Supreme Court has held that under IDEA Congress\nintended to provide a satisfactory level of educational opportunity, not\nthe best education that money could buy. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at\n189. The Court noted that \"[w]hatever Congress meant by an ‘appro-\npriate’ education, it is clear that it did not mean a potential-\nmaximizing education.\" Id. at 197 n.21; see also Hartmann v. Lou-\ndoun County Bd. of Ed., 118 F.3d 996, 1001 (4th Cir. 1997) (\"States\nmust . . . confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child,\n  1\n   IDEA is the successor to the Education of the Handicapped Act of\n1970, which was amended in 1975 and renamed the Education of All\nHandicapped Children Act. For the ease of reference, we refer only to\n\"IDEA,\" even when discussing cases interpreting the statute prior to the\n1990 amendments.\n\f4                           A.B. v. LAWSON\nbut the Act does not require the furnishing of every special service\nnecessary to maximize each handicapped child’s potential.\") (internal\ncitations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n    In addition to IDEA’s requirement that the state provide each stu-\ndent with some educational benefit, the student must be placed in the\nleast restrictive environment to achieve the FAPE. The disabled child\nis to participate in the same activities as non-disabled children to the\n\"maximum extent appropriate.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A); see also\n34 C.F.R. § 300.550 (\"That special classes, separate schooling or\nother removal of children with disabilities from the regular educa-\ntional environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the dis-\nability is such that education in regular classes cannot be achieved\nsatisfactorily.\"); Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A § 05.01.10 (regulations con-\ncerning least restrictive environments). We stated in DeVries v. Fair-\nfax County Sch. Bd., 882 F.2d 876, 878 (4th Cir. 1989),\n\"mainstreaming of handicapped children into regular school programs\n. . . is not only a laudable goal but is also a requirement of the Act.\"\n\n   To assure that students with disabilities receive FAPEs, IDEA\nrequires that school districts provide IEPs for each disabled child. 20\nU.S.C. § 1414(d). Before providing special education, the school dis-\ntrict must conduct an individual evaluation to determine a student’s\neligibility under IDEA. Id. § 1414(a)(1)(a); 34 C.F.R. § 300.531.\nUpon a determination that a student is learning disabled and thus eli-\ngible for special education services, the school district is to develop\nan IEP through cooperation between parents and school officials. 20\nU.S.C. § 1414(a)(5). The IEP is to be formulated by an IEP Team\nconsisting of the child’s parents, one of the student’s regular teachers,\na special education teacher, a representative of the school board, an\nindividual who can interpret evaluation results and, whenever appro-\npriate, the disabled child. Id. § 1414(d)(1)(B). An IEP must detail the\nstudent’s current educational status, set forth annual goals for the stu-\ndent’s education and state the special educational services and other\naids that will be provided to the child as well as the extent to which\nthe child will be mainstreamed. Id. § 1414(d)(1)(A).\n\n   IDEA also establishes a series of procedural safeguards \"designed\nto ensure that the parents or guardian of a child with a disability are\nboth notified of decisions affecting their child and given an opportu-\n\f                            A.B. v. LAWSON                             5\nnity to object to those decisions.\" MM, 303 F.3d at 527 (internal quo-\ntation marks and citation omitted); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1415\n(procedural safeguards). If the parents are not satisfied with the IEP,\nthey may \"present complaints with respect to any matter related to the\nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the\nprovision of a [FAPE] to such a child.\" Id. § 1415(b)(6). After such\na complaint has been received, the parents also are entitled to request\na due process hearing conducted by the state or local educational\nagency. Id. § 1415(f). Under Maryland law, the Maryland Office of\nAdministrative Hearings conducts the due process hearing. Md. Code\nAnn., Educ. § 8-413; Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A § 05.01.15. Any party\ncan then appeal the administrative ruling to federal or state court. Md.\nCode Ann., Educ. § 8-413(h).\n\n   When a state receiving IDEA funding fails to provide a FAPE, the\nchild’s parent may remove the child to a private school and then seek\ntuition reimbursement from the state. Sch. Comm. of Burlington v.\nDep’t of Ed., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985). The parent may recover\nif (1) the proposed IEP was inadequate to offer the child a FAPE and\n(2) the private education services obtained by the parents were appro-\npriate to the child’s needs. Id. at 370.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   AB is a student that all parties now agree is learning disabled in the\nareas of writing and reading, thus he is considered disabled under\nIDEA. The dispute between AACPS and DB arose because AB was\nnot initially coded as learning disabled, and once coded, DB and her\nexperts disagreed with the IEPs proposed by AACPS.\n\n   AB was born in 1990. He attended kindergarten through third\ngrade at Annapolis Area Christian School (\"Annapolis Christian\")\nduring the school years from 1995-1999. During 1997-1998, because\nof AB’s difficulties with reading, DB brought her son to AACPS for\neducational and psychological testing.The AACPS test results showed\nvarious IQ scores between 93 and 113, and its report noted that AB’s\nfull scale IQ placed him in the 58th percentile and that he was in the\naverage range of intellectual ability. On educational tests, AB scored\nbelow average for his grade in writing and word recognition, but he\nscored above his grade level in mathematics. AACPS concluded that\n\f6                          A.B. v. LAWSON\nthe student should be able to \"perform academically at a level consis-\ntent with same-aged peers.\" (J.A. 749.)\n\n   During the spring of 1998, Annapolis Christian administered multi-\nple achievement tests, finding that while AB was at an advanced level\nin arithmetic, he had difficulties in written language and reading. The\nfollowing spring, Annapolis Christian conducted more tests, and AB\nscored in the average range in reading but scored below his grade\nlevel in spelling. His arithmetic performance continued to be above\nhis grade level. At the administrative hearing, DB testified that her\nson was frustrated at Annapolis Christian and he was \"shutting down\"\nand \"withdrawing\" at the end of the third grade. At the end of the\n1998-1999 school year, Annapolis Christian recommended that AB\nrepeat the third grade.\n\n   In July 1999, DB had AB evaluated by the Kennedy Krieger Insti-\ntute (\"KKI\"). KKI tests results revealed AB’s Verbal IQ (WISC-III)\nwas in the high average range, Performance IQ in the superior range,\nand Full Scale IQ in the high average range. (J.A. 607.) By other test-\ning indicia, however, KKI found that AB’s \"reading and writing skills\n[were] poor enough to qualify him as learning disabled.\" (J.A. 611.)\n\n   Though Annapolis Christian recommended that AB repeat third\ngrade, DB withdrew her son from that school and enrolled him in the\nfourth grade in AACPS at Millersville Elementary School for the\n1999-2000 school year. Before the school year started, DB requested\nthat AACPS identify AB’s education needs and determine whether he\nhad a disability that would qualify him for special education. AACPS\nheld an IEP meeting on September 27, 1999. Based on the informa-\ntion presented at the meeting, AACPS recommended that AB receive\nfurther evaluations to be completed by November 22, 1999.\n\n   On October 5, 1999, AACPS’s school psychologist Sabbino Strip-\npoli (\"Strippoli\") administered the Oral and Written Language Scales\n(OWLS) to AB, and he found all of AB’s scores were within the aver-\nage range. On October 18, 1999, the IEP Team held another meeting\nand determined that AB did not have a learning disability. On October\n22, 1999, DB requested a due process hearing on AB’s eligibility for\nspecial education services. That hearing was scheduled for December\n2, 1999.\n\f                            A.B. v. LAWSON                             7\n   On November 8, 1999, the IEP Team held another meeting and\nconcluded that the student did not have a special education disability.\nAt the meeting, the IEP Team concluded that AB was making solid\nprogress in school, noting satisfactory grades and favorable comments\nby AB’s classroom teacher. DB, however, contended that AB would\nbe \"‘better off’ if he [was] identified as having a learning disability,\"\nbecause she asserted her son was performing at a level below his\npotential as evidenced by his high KKI ability scores. DB further\ncited the KKI report as determinative evidence of a learning disabil-\nity. (J.A. 631.)\n\n   On November 23, 1999, DB’s counsel requested that the due pro-\ncess hearing be postponed so she could obtain an independent evalua-\ntion for AB. On November 29, 1999, AACPS opposed the request for\npostponement. On the same day, DB’s attorney withdrew AB’s peti-\ntion for a due process hearing.\n\n   On January 5 and 10, 2000, Dr. Sue Antell conducted the indepen-\ndent evaluation. Dr. Antell concluded that AB was \"a child of supe-\nrior intellectual abilities with problems in complex language\nformulation giving rise to a Disorder of Written Expression, Reading\nDisabilities with problems in both vocabulary and comprehension.\"\n(J.A. 702.) After AACPS belatedly received AB’s scores on the tests\nconducted by Dr. Antell, AACPS offered to hold an IEP meeting on\nMarch 10 or March 17, 2000. DB found those dates inconvenient,\nthus the meeting was delayed.2\n\n   On March 22, 2000, the IEP Team reconvened and identified AB\nas having a \"special education disability.\" (J.A. 632.) The Team\nstated, however, that they had:\n\n      some reservations regarding an adverse impact on this stu-\n      dent’s educational performance to the extent that special\n      education services are warranted. This student is displaying\n  2\n   During this period, on February 24, 2000, DB took AB to meet with\na Summit School, a specialty school for gifted and talented children with\nlearning disabilities. The school administered tests on which AB’s read-\ning and spelling scores were below his grade average, but his arithmetic\nscore was above average for his grade.\n\f8                              A.B. v. LAWSON\n        satisfactory achievement based on the report card, work\n        samples and classroom performance. [DB’s] representatives\n        do not agree that there is a lack of impact on his educational\n        performance and believe that he needs intensive educational\n        services.3\n\n(J.A. 632.) On April 7, 2000, Strippoli prepared a report regarding the\nIEP Team’s interpretation of the various assessment results. An IEP\nmeeting originally scheduled for April 14, 2000 was again delayed to\naccommodate DB’s expert Dr. Antell. At the rescheduled May 3\nmeeting, the Team presented the draft IEP, and the parties agreed to\nreconvene on May 30, 2000 to give DB time to review the draft. The\ndraft IEP found AB had a disability limited to the area of written\nexpression. (J.A. 16, 25, 48.)\n\n   On May 15, 2000, Dr. Antell sent AACPS’s counsel a letter stating\nthat the proposed IEP was unacceptable. She concluded that a main-\nstream public school education would not provide AB proper flexibil-\nity, but also that \"[AB]’s superior intelligence render [sic] it\ninappropriate to place him in a public school’s ‘special class’ for chil-\ndren with far more severe and persuasive disabilities. Again, the only\navailable option appears to be placement in a specialized private\nschool for intelligent children with significant learning disabilities,\nsuch as Summit School.\" (J.A. 709 (emphasis added).) At the May 30\n    3\n    Indeed, AB’s report card for the 1999-2000 school year evidences that\nhe earned primarily A’s, B’s and C’s (he earned a single D in \"communi-\ncat[ing] mathematical concepts and ideas\" for one of four marking peri-\nods). (J.A. 688.) He received \"satisfactory\" and \"very good\" marks for\nall of his classes. (J.A. 688.) His reading level, however, was found to\nbe below average during each of the four marking periods. (J.A. 688.)\nHis teacher noted that \"[AB] is a pleasure to have in class. He is quick\nto participate in group discussion,\" and further added that he was a \"de-\nlight\" who \"comes to class prepared and participates regularly.\" She\npointed out at various points, that he had difficulty with spelling, and\nduring the third marking period when he received the D that he had diffi-\nculty communicating math concepts. (J.A. 689-90.) During the final\nmarking period, however, she stated \"[n]ice improvement in math, [AB]\"\nas the communication mark was a C and the rest of his math grades were\nB’s. AB was also promoted to the fifth grade at the end of the year. (J.A.\n688.)\n\f                           A.B. v. LAWSON                            9\nIEP meeting, at DB’s insistence supported by Dr. Antell and the KKI\nevaluation, the IEP Team agreed to further consider whether AB was\nalso learning disabled in reading. DB, however, denied AACPS’s\nrequest to conduct testing on an expedited basis because she con-\ntended the assessments already provided a basis for the diagnosis.\n\n   On June 6, 2000, DB filed another request for a due process hear-\ning, arguing that AB should be coded learning disabled in reading.\nAfter AACPS moved to dismiss the hearing request as premature,\nDB’s counsel withdrew her request for a hearing on July 27, 2000. On\nor around July 31, 2000, DB granted consent to conduct additional\ntesting.\n\n   On August 12, 2000, AACPS administered the Lindamood Audi-\ntory Conceptualization (LAC) test to AB. The test showed that AB\ncould read and spell at approximately the third grade level and his\n\"phonemic ability\" was not fully developed. On August 15, 2000, DB\nnotified AACPS that she would be placing AB in the Summit School\nfor the 2000-2001 school year at AACPS’s expense. On August 23,\n2000, AACPS administered the Wechsler Individual Achievement\nTest to AB. That test found reading difficulties; AB scored approxi-\nmately two years below his grade level on each of the tests.\n\n   AB enrolled in and attended the Summit School for the 2000-01\nschool year. On August 30, 2000, counsel for AACPS notified DB’s\ncounsel that an IEP meeting was scheduled for September 11, 2000,\nhowever, at DB’s request the meeting was pushed back one month to\naccommodate Dr. Antell. At the October meeting, the IEP Team\ndefined AB as having a learning disability in the area of reading in\naddition to the already identified disability in written expression.\nAACPS presented an IEP plan whereby AB would attend 31.25 hours\nof general (integrated) education per week and various forms of spe-\ncial education each day, amounting to 9.0 hours of special education\neach week. DB requested time to review the IEP. On October 17,\n2000, Dr. Antell wrote AACPS again, contesting the IEP’s suffi-\nciency and requesting that it provide AB with (among other things):\nbooks on tape, a reader, a note taker, extra time for math assignments,\noral presentations of math lessons, a dictation system or similar appa-\nratus and other accommodations.\n\f10                          A.B. v. LAWSON\n   Again, per DB’s request, the IEP meeting was scheduled for\nNovember 29, 2000. At the November 29 IEP meeting, the Team con-\nsidered Dr. Antell’s letter as well as a speech/language pathology\nevaluation from April 2000, which DB presented for the first time.\nDB additionally requested that AB be placed in a full-day special edu-\ncation program. The IEP Team agreed to review the April 2000 evalu-\nation and discuss it at a follow-up meeting.\n\n   On February 8, 2001, DB proposed that an IEP meeting be held on\nMarch 14, 2001, and she stated that Dr. Joan McCarthy of the Summit\nSchool would attend. At the March 14, 2001 meeting, the IEP Team\nsubmitted a revised IEP which called for 10.5 hours of special educa-\ntion. DB again declined to accept the IEP because it did not entail\nfull-time special education. Dissatisfied with AACPS’s proposal, DB\nleft AB enrolled at the Summit School and pursued her challenge to\nthe proposed IEP through a due process hearing.\n\n                                   C.\n\n  On May 23 and June 6, 2001, an ALJ conducted the due process\nhearing at AACPS’s offices in Annapolis to consider (1) whether the\nIEP offered by AACPS for the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school\nyears was reasonably calculated to provide a FAPE; and (2) if not,\nwhether DB should be reimbursed for the cost of the Summit School.\nAt the hearing, the ALJ admitted fifty-eight exhibits and heard testi-\nmony from eight witnesses.\n\n   On July 12, 2001, the ALJ issued an order holding that both IEPs\nwere reasonably calculated to offer a FAPE and denying DB’s request\nfor reimbursement. In issuing its order, the ALJ considered the par-\nties’ joint stipulated findings of fact, as presented at the hearing, and\nmade numerous additional findings of fact based on a preponderance\nof the evidence. The ALJ first dismissed DB’s claim that her son had\nbeen improperly evaluated and coded by AACPS, stating there was\n\"no evidence presented at the hearing to show that the evaluation pro-\ncess was flawed, that the Parent was not provided with a meaningful\nopportunity to participate, or that any factors or considerations pre-\nsented by the Parent were not duly considered during the process.\"\nALJ Op. at 24 (J.A. 29).\n\f                           A.B. v. LAWSON                            11\n   DB’s claim rested on her assumption that AACPS should have\nimmediately coded her son as learning disabled based on the KKI\nevaluation. Indeed, the ALJ considered DB’s claim that the lengthy\nevaluation process impacted her child’s academic progress, and found\nthe measures taken by AACPS to diagnose the child were proper,\nalbeit lengthy. ALJ Op. at 24-25 (J.A. 29-30). The ALJ held that\n\"AACPS was not required to rely on the [KKI] report,\" noting that the\nresponsibility to determine whether a student is eligible for special\neducation is the responsibility of the IEP Team. ALJ Op. at 26-27\n(J.A. 31-32).\n\n   The ALJ concluded that the IEP was \"reasonably calculated\" to\nprovide AB educational benefit, citing IDEA’s mandate that \"to the\nmaximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities be educated\nwith children who are not disabled.\" ALJ Op. at 33-34 (J.A. 38-39).\nIn holding that the proposed IEP offered a FAPE, the ALJ credited\nthe testimony of AACPS’s experts, finding that the child did not\nrequire all-day special education and that the proposed IEP offered\nthe least restrictive means of conferring educational benefit to the\nchild. The judge cited AACPS’s expert testimony, which she credited,\nfinding that the Summit School program was \"overly restrictive.\" ALJ\nOp. at 29 (internal quotation marks omitted) (J.A. 34). Thus, the ALJ\nrejected the views of DB and her experts, who had maintained that\nAB required an entire school day with special educational services.\nIn so holding, she rejected DB’s contention that the child must \"be\nplaced in a private school that serves only students with learning dis-\nabilities.\" (J.A. 41.)\n\n   In supporting her holding that the IEP offered a FAPE, the ALJ\nnoted her reliance on testimony from Millersville personnel as well\nas evidence of AB’s educational progress as measured by his report\ncard and teacher’s comments. ALJ Op. at 30-31 (J.A. 35-36). In\nreviewing such data, the ALJ noted that AB’s reading ability\nincreased nearly two grade levels while attending Millersville despite\nthe fact that he was not receiving special education. See ALJ Opinion\nat 29 (J.A. 34). On the basis of such evidence, the ALJ concluded\n\"there is no indication that the Child’s needs cannot be met at Millers-\nville Elementary School.\" ALJ Op. at 30 (J.A. 35). The ALJ con-\ncluded that under IDEA, \"[t]he issue is not whether the Summit\nSchool is better, or even appropriate, but whether AACPS has offered\n\f12                         A.B. v. LAWSON\n. . . an appropriate program for the Child at Millersville Elementary.\"\nALJ Op. at 36-37 (J.A. 41-42). In denying DB’s claim, the ALJ\nacknowledged that while she appreciated DB’s concern that given\nAB’s high IQ, he should have performed at a greater academic level\nat Millersville and in contrast was \"thriving\" at the Summit School,\nALJ Op. at 30 (J.A. 35), \"IDEA does not require a program that\nwould maximize a student’[s] potential, but instead simply a program\nthat is appropriate,\" id. at 36 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted) (J.A. 41).\n\n                                  D.\n\n   On January 8, 2002, DB filed a complaint in the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the District of Maryland, appealing the ALJ’s decision\nand requesting declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to IDEA, 20\nU.S.C. §§ 1400, et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and\n42 U.S.C. § 1983. After cross-motions for summary judgment, the\nmagistrate judge granted summary judgment for the Bs, holding that\nAACPS’s IEPs did not offer a FAPE. The court further ordered that\nAACPS reimburse DB for the costs of Summit School for the 2000-\n2001 and 2001-2002 school years, holding that the Summit School\nprovided the least restrictive means of providing a FAPE.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   Ordinarily, we review a district court’s grant of summary judgment\nde novo, applying the same standards employed by the district court.\nU.S. Search, LLC v. U.S. Search.com Inc., 300 F.3d 517, 522 (4th Cir.\n2002) (citations omitted). In the IDEA context, as we explained in\nMM, 303 F.3d at 530-31, we are \"obliged to conduct a modified de\nnovo review, giving ‘due weight’ to the underlying administrative\nproceedings\" (citations omitted). Additionally, \"[w]hether a district\ncourt has accorded ‘due weight’ to the administrative proceedings is\na question of law — or at least a mixed question of law and fact —\nto be reviewed de novo by an appellate court.\" Id. at 531. Further,\nadministrative findings in an IDEA case \"are entitled to prima facie\ncorrectness,\" and \"the district court, if it is not going to follow them\nis required to explain why it does not.\" Doyle v. Arlington County\nSch. Bd., 953 F.2d 100, 105 (4th Cir. 1991). Indeed, \"we need not\ndefer to factual recitations made by a district court from the adminis-\n\f                           A.B. v.

The Supreme Court has directed that\n\"courts must be careful to avoid imposing their view of preferable\neducational methods upon the States.\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207.\n\n                                  III.\n\n                                  A.\n\n   On appeal, AACPS argues that the district court erred in finding a\nviolation of IDEA. AACPS contends that, as the ALJ held, the IEP\nfor the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school years was (1) reasonably\ncalculated to offer a FAPE and (2) it was the least restrictive environ-\nment for the child. We consider these arguments in turn. Overarching\nall of Appellants’ arguments is their contention that the district court\nerred in failing to accord the ALJ’s findings proper deference. See\ngenerally Appellants’ Br. at 27-32. Appellees counter that the district\ncourt properly deviated from the ALJ’s findings of fact and \"made\nfactual findings and legal conclusions de novo, with explicit reasons\ntherefore.\" Appellees’ Br. at 22. They argue that AACPS’s proposed\nIEPs did not offer AB a FAPE. Appellees further contend that the IEP\nwas not the least restrictive environment, because — despite outward\nappearances — \"[AB] did not make progress in the general education\nsetting.\" Id. at 33.\n\n   We find Appellees’ arguments wholly unconvincing. The district\ncourt ignored the principles animating IDEA and wrongfully dis-\nmissed the ALJ’s findings of fact. The district court substituted its\nown views on educational policy — and those of DB and her experts\n— for the determinations of the local education officials charged with\nformulating an IEP. Accordingly, we reverse the district court and\nhold that the ALJ correctly recognized that AACPS offered AB an\nIEP that was reasonably calculated to provide him some educational\n\f14                          A.B. v. LAWSON\nbenefit, thus providing a FAPE and satisfying IDEA’s modest\nrequirements. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 203-04; MM, 303 F.3d at 532.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   In Tice v. Botetourt County Sch. Bd., 908 F.2d 1200 (4th Cir.\n1990), we held that \"once a procedurally proper IEP has been formu-\nlated, a reviewing court should be reluctant indeed to second guess\nthe judgment of education professionals. Neither the district court nor\nthis court should disturb an IEP simply because we disagree with its\ncontent. . . . [W]e wholeheartedly agree that once education authori-\nties have made a professional judgment about the substantive content\nof a child’s IEP, that judgment must be respected.\" Id. at 1207-08\n(internal citations omitted).4 The ALJ recognized that the IEP Team’s\ndeterminations concerning AB’s eligibility for special education ser-\nvices were, by law, \"solely the responsibility of the IEP team.\" ALJ\nOp. at 32 (citing 34 C.F.R. § 300.532(a); Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A\n  4\n    Here, there is some controversy concerning whether DB properly pre-\nsented a substantive or a procedural challenge to the IEP at the adminis-\ntrative hearing. Significantly, the ALJ framed the questions on review as\nsubstantive challenges. See ALJ Op. at 2 (J.A. 7). Yet even if the Bs had\nproperly lodged their procedural challenge, the ALJ noted there was \"no\nevidence presented at the hearing to show the evaluation process\n[employed by AACPS] was flawed, that the parent was not provided\nwith a meaningful opportunity to participate . . . .\" ALJ Op. at 24 (J.A.\n29). The ALJ also concluded \"there were no procedural errors in this pro-\ncess.\" ALJ Op. at 27 (J.A. 32). On appeal, Appellees seem to admit that\nthey had not directly acknowledged a procedural violation, but because\nAB was denied learning disabled status during 1999-2000 it \"contributed\nto his need for full special ed[ucation] placement\" and \"the procedural\nand substantive violations are inextricably intertwined.\" Appellees’ Br.\nat 41. Regardless, we find that while AACPS’s coding process may not\nhave issued with the speed to which school districts should aspire, no\nprocedural violation was present. Indeed, as the ALJ found and as recited\nin the facts above, ante, the delays in coding AB and formulating an IEP\nare often directly attributable to the parent and her experts. Emblematic\nof the delays occasioned by DB was her presentation by ambush of a\nspeech/language pathology evaluation at the November 29, 2000 IEP\nmeeting, though that evaluation had been completed seven months ear-\nlier.\n\f                             A.B. v. LAWSON                              15\n§ 05.01.06) (additional citation omitted) (J.A. 32). As such, the ALJ\nfound the Team crafted an IEP reasonably calculated to provide AB\nwith some educational benefit and that AACPS officials made profes-\nsional judgments in accord with federal and Maryland regulations.\nThe ALJ correctly noted that the AACPS IEP Team considered a lit-\nany of factors concerning AB’s educational background, and pro-\nposed an IEP that focused on the child’s difficulties in reading and\nwriting, providing him with individualized services to improve in\nthose areas. Further, the ALJ found that the proposed IEPs reflected\nthe studied determinations of AACPS’s experts that the child did not\nrequire intensive special education in a segregated classroom. Finally,\nthe ALJ correctly and explicitly held that under IDEA, the AACPS\nIEP Team was not required to rely on the KKI report and complied\nwith state and federal law. ALJ Op. at 27-28 (J.A. 32-33).5\n\n                                    C.\n\n   DB has nonetheless continuously maintained that the proposed\nIEPs did not offer a FAPE because AB did not make progress in the\ngeneral educational setting. DB and her experts assert that AB would\nregress in general education, and that he required full-time special\neducation services. Undergirding all of DB’s arguments are her\nclaims that because AB, a child of above-average IQ, was not fulfill-\ning his potential within a general education setting — and, in contrast,\nallegedly was \"thriving\" and \"getting the help he needs\" at the Sum-\nmit School — AACPS was not in compliance with IDEA. Although,\nas discussed above, nowhere does IDEA require that a school system\n\"maximize\" a student’s potential, Rowley, 458 U.S. at 189, the district\ncourt ignored the findings of the ALJ and adopted DB’s contrary\nreading of the statute.\n  5\n    In contending that AACPS should have determined AB was learning\ndisabled solely on the basis of KKI, Appellees’ argument squarely con-\nflicts with the statutory language of IDEA. The statute provides that dur-\ning the IEP evaluation process, the school district \"shall . . . not use any\nsingle procedure as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is\na child with a disability or determining an appropriate educational pro-\ngram . . . .\" 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(2). Additionally, the IEP Team has full\ndiscretion to \"identify what additional data, if any, are needed to deter-\nmine . . . whether the child needs special education and related services\n. . . .\" Id. § 1414(c)(1)(B)(iii).\n\f16                           A.B. v. LAWSON\n   Whereas the ALJ found that the IEP was formulated to meet AB’s\neducational needs and a general education setting was appropriate\nbecause, in part, \"the Child made educational progress during the aca-\ndemic year he spent at Millersville, albeit not as great as the Parent\nhad hoped for,\" ALJ Op. at 30-31 (J.A. 35-36), the district court con-\nsistently reached diametrically opposing conclusions, see e.g., Dist.\nCt. Op. at 19 (J.A. 73) (\"[AB] require[s] full-time placement in spe-\ncial education services in order to make educational progress and to\nobtain some benefit\"); id. at 20 (J.A. 74) (\"[AB] would have regressed\nrather than progressed were [AACPS’s proposed IEP] to have been\nimplemented.\").\n\n    Appellees contend, however, that the district court properly dis-\ncarded the ALJ’s factual findings in reversing the administrative\nbody. However, we find the district court repudiated the findings of\nthe ALJ and discarded the expertise of the IEP Team without reason\nor explanation. Instead, the district court simply adopted the world-\nview of DB’s experts and their perspectives on proper educational\npolicy. Nowhere did the district court try to square its findings with\nthose of the ALJ, although in this circuit the determination of whether\nan IEP is appropriate is a question of fact. See DiBuo v. Bd. of Ed.\nof Worcester County, 309 F.3d 184, n.8 (4th Cir. 2002); Doyle, 953\nF.2d at 105. Nor did the district court explain how it, despite the fact\nthat it was reviewing a cold record, reached a conclusion completely\ncontrary to that of the ALJ, who conducted the proceedings. See\nDoyle, 953 F.2d at 105 (noting that the district court \"if it is not going\nto follow [the ALJ’s findings of fact], is required to explain why it\ndoes not\"). Rather than providing the required explanations, the dis-\ntrict court substituted its own credibility assessments for those of the\nALJ, stating only that it found \"the testimony provided by AACPS to\nhave been externally and internally inconsistent, generally garbled\nand aimed primarily at self-justification. The testimony on behalf of\nthe plaintiffs, in contrast, was clear and consistent. . . . [T]he court\nfinds wholly competent the assessments from the plaintiffs’ witnesses\n. . . and incompetent the assessment from AACPS.\" Dist. Ct. Op. at\n18 (J.A. 72).6\n  6\n   In purported support of their argument that the district court was cor-\nrect to jettison the ALJ’s findings, Appellees cite a case that is contrary\n\f                             A.B. v. LAWSON                               17\n   In doing so, the district court disregarded the ALJ’s resolution of\nconflicting expert testimony. The ALJ carefully considered the views\nof DB’s experts Drs. Antell and McCarthy, implicitly finding them\nunconvincing while crediting the contrary views of AACPS’s experts.7\nDespite the ALJ’s findings, the district court’s opinion rests almost\nentirely upon a voluminous discussion of Drs. Antell and McCarthy’s\ntestimony. See Dist. Ct. Op. at 5-14 (J.A. 59-68). The district court\nthus reached factual conclusions entirely irreconcilable with those of\nthe ALJ. E.g., \"[C]hildren with superior intelligence and learning dis-\norders require special treatment in a special classroom setting;\" \"addi-\ntional testing that was performed by AACPS was unnecessary;\" \"what\n[AB] needed could not . . . be done at this point in an inclusion class-\nroom or general ed classroom;\" \"[AB] not only could not succeed but\nwould degenerate in a general education setting;\" \"an appropriate IEP\ncould not be implemented at Millersville because the school did not\nhave the ability to integrate all of the goals in every classroom, in\nevery subject, with every teacher.\" The district court fully adopted Dr.\nMcCarthy’s testimony that \"placement at Summit was ‘absolutely’\nthe least restrictive environment in which [AB] could learn and reiter-\n\nto their position. See Appellees’ Br. at 19-20 (citing Arlington County\nSch. Bd. v. Smith, 230 F. Supp. 2d 704 (E.D. Va. 2002)). While the dis-\ntrict court in Arlington County did reverse the ALJ decision, it did so\nbecause \"the hearing officer succumbed to the temptation which exists\nfor judges and hearing officers alike in IDEA cases, to make his own\nindependent judgment as to the best placement . . . instead of relying on\nthe record evidence presented in the hearing\" and \"defer[ring] to educa-\ntors’ decisions as long as the IEP provided the child the basic floor of\nopportunity . . . .\" Id. at 713, 715 (citations omitted). Here, precisely the\nopposite situation occurred. The ALJ made the factual finding that a\nproper IEP had been formulated, yet the district court, like the hearing\nofficer in Arlington County, succumbed to its temptation to inject itself\ninto matters of professional educational judgment.\n   7\n     For example, the ALJ stated that DB claimed the IEP goals drafted\nby Dr. McCarthy were the \"only appropriate ones for the Child,\" and\nnoted that Drs. McCarthy and Antell \"testified in great detail as to the\ninferiority of the AACPS IEP and the superiority of the special education\nservices that the Child is receiving at the Summit School.\" ALJ Op. at\n24 (J.A. 29). Yet the ALJ reached a completely opposite result, holding\nthat the IEP complied with IDEA.\n\f18                           A.B. v. LAWSON\nated that placing [AB] in a general education setting was not appro-\npriate\" although that assessment was flatly contradicted by AACPS’s\nexperts which the ALJ credited. Dist. Ct. Op. at 14 (J.A. 68).\n\n   In its sweeping dismissal of the ALJ’s findings — with little expla-\nnation other than that on the basis of a cold record it found their\nexperts \"generally garbled and aimed primarily at self-justification\"\n— the district court wholly disregarded IDEA’s mandate that it\n\"leave[ ] the substance and the details of [the proper education for a\ndisabled child] to state and local officials.\" Barnett v. Fairfax County\nSch. Bd., 927 F.2d 146, 152 (4th Cir. 1991). The ALJ correctly recog-\nnized that while AACPS and DB’s experts disagreed, IDEA requires\ngreat deference to the views of the school system rather than those of\neven the most well-meaning parent. However, the district court failed\nto apply the proper standard of review to the ALJ’s findings and\nincorrectly applied IDEA’s FAPE standard.\n\n   First, the district court did not apply the proper standard in deter-\nmining whether the IEP at Millersville would provide an educational\nbenefit, rather it essentially assessed \"whether the IEP would replicate\nthe benefit to [AB] of the [Summit School program], which [the dis-\ntrict court found] successful for him.\" G ex rel. SSGT RG v. Ft. Bragg\nDependent Sch., 324 F.3d 240, 253, amended on reh’g, 343 F.3d 295\n(4th Cir. 2003). The district court ignored the fact that the ALJ found\nthat AB was obtaining \"some educational benefit\" at AACPS even\nwhen he was receiving no special education. See ALJ Op. at 29 (not-\ning AB’s reading level had increased nearly two grade levels while\nat Millersville) (J.A. 34); id. at 30-31 (\"the Child made educational\nprogress during the academic year he spent at Millersville, albeit not\nas great as the Parent had hoped for\") (J.A. 35-36).8 Yet the district\ncourt did not even bother to refer to the ALJ’s findings that AB made\nprogress at Millersville, rather the Magistrate Judge simply accepted\n— contrary to the findings of fact and weight of the evidence — Dr.\nMcCarthy’s testimony that AB \"would degenerate in a general educa-\n  8\n    As discussed above, AB’s report card for his year at Millersville, ante\nn.3, also supports the ALJ’s findings. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207 n.28\n(recognizing that \"achievement of passing marks and advancement from\ngrade to grade\" are \"important factor[s] in determining educational bene-\nfit\").\n\f                             A.B. v. LAWSON                              19\ntional setting.\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 13 (J.A. 67); see also id. at 20 (\"the\nCourt is convinced that the final IEP offered by AACPS for [AB] was\nnot designed to confer some educational benefit upon him and, in\nfact, that [AB] would have regressed rather than progressed were such\na program to have been implemented\") (J.A. 74).\n\n   The district court not only evaded the ALJ’s findings without\nexplanation, but it also credited the testimony of Dr. McCarthy\nthough it was riddled with internal inconsistencies. Specifically, the\nMagistrate Judge chose to ignore that Dr. McCarthy acknowledged\nthat AB had \"at minimum a satisfactory year\" academically at Mil-\nlersville. (J.A. 353.) Indeed, that admission completely refutes the dis-\ntrict court’s favored reading of Dr. McCarthy’s testimony, and wholly\nsupports the ALJ’s finding that AACPS offered a FAPE.\n\n   Appellees, however, have contended in their briefs and at oral\nargument that the district court gave proper deference to the ALJ’s\nfindings because the court’s 180-degree turn stemmed from \"unsup-\nported weight afforded to evidence (rather than on the credibility of\nwitnesses).\" Appellees’ Br. at 26-27. Appellees’ arguments indicate\nthat they simply do not understand the role of the fact finder. For they\nstate: \"The ALJ’s failure to consider significant parts of testimony\nand exhibits is doubly of concern. . . . For example, the administrative\ndecision literally only mentions Dr. Antell in passing, though the dis-\ntrict court opinion chiefly relies upon this expert’s testimony, and\nquotes her opinions in unabridged detail.\" Appellees’ Br. at 26 n.8\n(emphasis added). Appellees appear oblivious that this is precisely the\nrole of a fact finder. The ALJ heard extensive testimony from Drs.\nAntell and McCarthy who claimed the IEP did not offer a FAPE, yet\nin holding that AACPS provided a FAPE and resting its opinion on\nan entirely contrary body of expert testimony, the ALJ obviously\nfound the testimony of Appellees’ experts unpersuasive. In essence,\nAppellees’ argument is reducible to the sour grapes claim that the\nALJ was simply wrong in failing to rely on the testimony of Drs.\nAntell and McCarthy. Accordingly, that argument merely illustrates\njust how far the district court had to deviate from the ALJ’s findings\nto reach its result.9\n  9\n   Additionally, Appellees argue, relying on Springer v. Fairfax County\nSch. Bd., 134 F.3d 659, 663 n.* (4th Cir. 1998), that the district court did\n\f20                           A.B. v. LAWSON\n   In \"chiefly relying\" on Dr. Antell’s testimony, the district court\nadopted DB’s preferred reading of what IDEA requires. DB and her\nexperts testified before the ALJ they believed the Summit School\nenvironment was \"ideal;\" AB was \"thriving\" and \"getting the help he\nneeds there;\" and \"given his high IQ, he should be performing at a\nmuch greater academic level than he has done in the past.\" ALJ Op.\nat 30 (internal quotation marks omitted) (J.A. 35). However, as the\nALJ recognized, but the district court ignored, this is not what IDEA\nrequires. Indeed, \"[t]he issue is not whether the Summit School is bet-\nter, or even appropriate, but whether AACPS has offered . . . an\nappropriate program for the Child at Millersville Elementary.\" ALJ\nOp. at 37 (J.A. 42). As discussed above, IDEA’s FAPE standards are\nfar more modest than to require that a child excel or thrive. The\nrequirement is satisfied when the state provides the disabled child\nwith \"personalized instruction with sufficient support services to per-\nmit the child to benefit educationally from the instruction.\" Rowley,\n458 U.S. at 203; accord MM, 303 F.3d at 526-27; Hartmann, 118\nF.3d at 1001. In this case, the record shows that AACPS’s proposed\nIEPs offered AB a FAPE.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n   Given that we find the district court erred in overturning the ALJ’s\nfindings that the IEP provided a FAPE, it follows a fortiori that the\n\nnot need to accord the ALJ’s findings any deference because the \"admin-\nistrative decision assigns an inaccurate degree of weight to critical evi-\ndence,\" and the ALJ decision was \"cursory and conclusory.\" Appellees’\nBr. at 25-26. Springer, however, is readily distinguishable from this case.\nIn Springer, the local hearing officer did not rely on expert testimony but\n\"[r]el[ied] exclusively on a letter written by a psychiatrist.\" 134 F.3d at\n662 (emphasis added). Here, however, the ALJ conducted a formal hear-\ning and considered witness testimony and multiple exhibits. The ALJ\nwas in a far superior position to evaluate such witness testimony than the\ncourt below, which relied on a body of completely contrary testimony\nwithin the cold record. Springer is also distinguishable because the\ncourts were in a position identical to the local hearing officer in evaluat-\ning the letter — a document within a cold record — upon which the offi-\ncer’s decision was based. Moreover, the ALJ’s opinion here is anything\nbut conclusory and cursory. To the contrary, the ALJ made extensive\nfactual findings and applied governing precedent \"explain[ing] the result\nwith some care\" as Springer, supra, requires.\n\f                           A.B. v. LAWSON                            21\nAACPS IEP, with its integrated curriculum, was less restrictive than\nthe wholly segregated Summit School. IDEA requires mainstreaming\nthat Summit School does not provide. 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(B); see\nDeVries, 882 F.2d at 876. While the district court stated that it was\n\"mindful of the Congressional preference for mainstreaming,\" Dist.\nCt. Op. at 19 (J.A. 73), its holding that only the wholly segregated\neducational environment that Summit provided offered a FAPE\nrefutes such purported mindfulness. The district court held that AB\nrequired a \"full-time placement\" in a program with learning disabled\nchildren of \"above-average intelligence,\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 19 (J.A. 73).\nThe lower court then took judicial notice of a Learning Dis-\nabled/Gifted and Talented Program designed for learning disabled\nstudents with high cognitive ability in Montgomery County. Id. at 19\nn.3. In holding that the appropriate placement for AB was \"full-time\nplacement in special education services . . . with children of above-\naverage intelligence,\" the court erroneously substituted its judgment\nfor those of education professionals. MM, supra; Rowley, supra. The\ndistrict court’s holding bears repeating: the Magistrate Judge found\nthe least restrictive way — indeed the only way — to educate AB was\nto place him in a wholly segregated special education classroom in\nwhich students were also \"gifted and talented,\" while also forcing\nAACPS to pay for such a placement. At minimum, the district court\nshowed no \"reluctan[ce] to second-guess professional educators\" at\nAACPS. MM, 303 F.3d at 532.\n\n   First, there was no evidence in the record as to whether AACPS\nhad such a Gifted and Talented program for learning disabled students\nin which AB could be enrolled. Additionally, there was no evidence\nin the record showing that AB would be devoid of interaction with\nchildren of \"above-average intelligence\" in classes at Millersville.\nFinally, there was no evidence in the record regarding the program at\nColonel E. Brooke Lee Middle School, which the district court so\nreadily endorsed, despite the fact that AB was an elementary school\nstudent during the period at issue. Regardless of the educational effi-\ncacy of that program, or the schooling at Summit, the FAPE analysis\namounts to whether the AACPS IEP was reasonably calculated to con-\nfer some educational benefit. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(17); MM, 303 F.3d\nat 532. In applying the wrong standard, the district court \"substi-\ntut[ed] [its] own notions of sound educational policy for those of local\n\f22                          A.B. v. LAWSON\nschool authorities.\" MM, 303 F.3d at 531 (internal quotation and cita-\ntion omitted).\n\n   Even after skewing the proper analysis of whether AACPS pro-\nvided some educational benefit, the district court still had to ignore\nthe ALJ’s factual findings regarding Summit to reach its result. The\ndistrict court first disregarded the ALJ’s clear factual finding that AB\nhad \"mixed\" results at Summit.10 Instead, the district court conclu-\nsorily stated that at Summit: \"[AB] vaulted three grade levels in math-\nematics, which tends to support the assessments of Drs. Antell and\nMcCarthy that the alternative strategies employed at Summit, and not\nrecommended by AACPS, were working and were permitting AB to\nobtain some benefit . . . .\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 19 (J.A. 73). In relying on\nthis evidence and making such a determination, the district court\nmade no mention of AB’s inconsistent progress at Summit in the\nareas of reading and written language — the very areas in which all\nparties agree that he was learning disabled. Indeed, the record consis-\ntently reflects that throughout his educational history, AB regularly\nscored above his age and grade level in mathematics.\n\n   In sum, the magistrate judge ignored the congressional preference\nfor mainstreaming, clearly and strongly substituted its views on edu-\ncation and IDEA for that of Congress, and failed to accord the ALJ’s\nfactual findings the requisite degree of deference. In reversing the\nALJ, the district court consistently failed to heed \"IDEA’s recognition\nthat federal courts cannot run local schools. Local educators deserve\nlatitude in determining the individualized education program most\nappropriate for a disabled child. The IDEA does not deprive these\neducators of the right to apply their professional judgment.\" Hart-\nmann, 118 F.3d at 1001. As the ALJ determined, the AACPS IEP\noffered an integrated education, and AB had already made progress\nwithin that setting.11\n  10\n     The ALJ found AB’s performance in math at Summit was \"solid\" but\n\"his performance in written language and reading/language arts was\ninconsistent . . . .\" ALJ Op. at 18 (J.A. 23).\n  11\n     As a final attempt to support its finding that the Summit School was\nthe least restrictive placement, the district court again ventured outside\nthe record to state \"that not all the students at Summit have been defined\n\f                            A.B. v. LAWSON                            23\n                                   V.\n\n   Because we hold that AACPS offered AB a FAPE, the issue of\nreimbursement under Burlington, supra, and Florence County Sch.\nDist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7 (1993), is clearly inapplicable.\n\n                                  VI.\n\n   For the reasons stated above, we reverse the judgment of the dis-\ntrict court and remand with instructions that the district court enter\nsummary judgment in favor of AACPS. Accordingly, we also vacate\nthe district court’s order that AACPS reimburse DB for the costs of\neducating her son at the Summit School during the 2000-2001 and\n2001-2002 school years.\n\n                                        REVERSED AND REMANDED\n\nby their school systems as learning disabled.\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 20. (J.A.\n74.) This finding, however, is a strawman. The magistrate judge had\nalready determined that \"not only did [AB] require full-time placement\nin special education services in order to make educational progress and\nto obtain some benefit from education services but also that the appro-\npriate placement was and is with children of above-average intelli-\ngence.\" Id. (emphasis added). Neither party disputed that Summit was a\nsegregated learning disabled-exclusive school, and indeed Summit’s own\npublications support that finding.

The district court concluded that such reimburse-\nment was necessary because AACPS denied AB a free appropriate\npublic education (\"FAPE\").\n\n    AACPS and the student’s mother, DB, had engaged in a protracted\ndispute as to the nature and extent of AB’s learning disability. An\nadministrative law judge held that AACPS formulated an Individual-\nized Education Program (\"IEP\") for the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002\nschool years that was reasonably calculated to provide AB with a\nFAPE under IDEA. The district court reversed the ALJ’s ruling and\ngranted summary judgment for the Bs. The lower court held that AB\nhad not been provided a FAPE, and AACPS was obligated to reim-\nburse DB for two years of private school education. Because, as\nexplained below, AACPS complied with IDEA and formulated an\nIEP reasonably calculated to provide AB with some educational bene-\nfit, we reverse the district court and direct that summary judgment be\nentered for Appellants.

The dispute between AACPS and DB arose because AB was\nnot initially coded as learning disabled, and once coded, DB and her\nexperts disagreed with the IEPs proposed by AACPS.\n\n   AB was born in 1990. He attended kindergarten through third\ngrade at Annapolis Area Christian School (\"Annapolis Christian\")\nduring the school years from 1995-1999. During 1997-1998, because\nof AB’s difficulties with reading, DB brought her son to AACPS for\neducational and psychological testing.The AACPS test results showed\nvarious IQ scores between 93 and 113, and its report noted that AB’s\nfull scale IQ placed him in the 58th percentile and that he was in the\naverage range of intellectual ability. On educational tests, AB scored\nbelow average for his grade in writing and word recognition, but he\nscored above his grade level in mathematics. AACPS concluded that\n\f6                          A.B. v. LAWSON\nthe student should be able to \"perform academically at a level consis-\ntent with same-aged peers.\" (J.A. 749.)\n\n   During the spring of 1998, Annapolis Christian administered multi-\nple achievement tests, finding that while AB was at an advanced level\nin arithmetic, he had difficulties in written language and reading. The\nfollowing spring, Annapolis Christian conducted more tests, and AB\nscored in the average range in reading but scored below his grade\nlevel in spelling. His arithmetic performance continued to be above\nhis grade level. At the administrative hearing, DB testified that her\nson was frustrated at Annapolis Christian and he was \"shutting down\"\nand \"withdrawing\" at the end of the third grade. At the end of the\n1998-1999 school year, Annapolis Christian recommended that AB\nrepeat the third grade.\n\n   In July 1999, DB had AB evaluated by the Kennedy Krieger Insti-\ntute (\"KKI\"). KKI tests results revealed AB’s Verbal IQ (WISC-III)\nwas in the high average range, Performance IQ in the superior range,\nand Full Scale IQ in the high average range. (J.A. 607.) By other test-\ning indicia, however, KKI found that AB’s \"reading and writing skills\n[were] poor enough to qualify him as learning disabled.\" (J.A. 611.)\n\n   Though Annapolis Christian recommended that AB repeat third\ngrade, DB withdrew her son from that school and enrolled him in the\nfourth grade in AACPS at Millersville Elementary School for the\n1999-2000 school year. Before the school year started, DB requested\nthat AACPS identify AB’s education needs and determine whether he\nhad a disability that would qualify him for special education. AACPS\nheld an IEP meeting on September 27, 1999. Based on the informa-\ntion presented at the meeting, AACPS recommended that AB receive\nfurther evaluations to be completed by November 22, 1999.\n\n   On October 5, 1999, AACPS’s school psychologist Sabbino Strip-\npoli (\"Strippoli\") administered the Oral and Written Language Scales\n(OWLS) to AB, and he found all of AB’s scores were within the aver-\nage range. On October 18, 1999, the IEP Team held another meeting\nand determined that AB did not have a learning disability. On October\n22, 1999, DB requested a due process hearing on AB’s eligibility for\nspecial education services. That hearing was scheduled for December\n2, 1999.\n\f                            A.B. v. LAWSON                             7\n   On November 8, 1999, the IEP Team held another meeting and\nconcluded that the student did not have a special education disability.\nAt the meeting, the IEP Team concluded that AB was making solid\nprogress in school, noting satisfactory grades and favorable comments\nby AB’s classroom teacher. DB, however, contended that AB would\nbe \"‘better off’ if he [was] identified as having a learning disability,\"\nbecause she asserted her son was performing at a level below his\npotential as evidenced by his high KKI ability scores. DB further\ncited the KKI report as determinative evidence of a learning disabil-\nity. (J.A. 631.)\n\n   On November 23, 1999, DB’s counsel requested that the due pro-\ncess hearing be postponed so she could obtain an independent evalua-\ntion for AB. On November 29, 1999, AACPS opposed the request for\npostponement. On the same day, DB’s attorney withdrew AB’s peti-\ntion for a due process hearing.\n\n   On January 5 and 10, 2000, Dr. Sue Antell conducted the indepen-\ndent evaluation. Dr. Antell concluded that AB was \"a child of supe-\nrior intellectual abilities with problems in complex language\nformulation giving rise to a Disorder of Written Expression, Reading\nDisabilities with problems in both vocabulary and comprehension.\"\n(J.A. 702.) After AACPS belatedly received AB’s scores on the tests\nconducted by Dr. Antell, AACPS offered to hold an IEP meeting on\nMarch 10 or March 17, 2000. DB found those dates inconvenient,\nthus the meeting was delayed.2\n\n   On March 22, 2000, the IEP Team reconvened and identified AB\nas having a \"special education disability.\" (J.A. 632.) The Team\nstated, however, that they had:\n\n      some reservations regarding an adverse impact on this stu-\n      dent’s educational performance to the extent that special\n      education services are warranted. This student is displaying\n  2\n   During this period, on February 24, 2000, DB took AB to meet with\na Summit School, a specialty school for gifted and talented children with\nlearning disabilities. The school administered tests on which AB’s read-\ning and spelling scores were below his grade average, but his arithmetic\nscore was above average for his grade.\n\f8                              A.B. v.

[DB’s] representatives\n        do not agree that there is a lack of impact on his educational\n        performance and believe that he needs intensive educational\n        services.3\n\n(J.A. 632.) On April 7, 2000, Strippoli prepared a report regarding the\nIEP Team’s interpretation of the various assessment results. An IEP\nmeeting originally scheduled for April 14, 2000 was again delayed to\naccommodate DB’s expert Dr. Antell. At the rescheduled May 3\nmeeting, the Team presented the draft IEP, and the parties agreed to\nreconvene on May 30, 2000 to give DB time to review the draft. The\ndraft IEP found AB had a disability limited to the area of written\nexpression. (J.A. 16, 25, 48.)\n\n   On May 15, 2000, Dr. Antell sent AACPS’s counsel a letter stating\nthat the proposed IEP was unacceptable. She concluded that a main-\nstream public school education would not provide AB proper flexibil-\nity, but also that \"[AB]’s superior intelligence render [sic] it\ninappropriate to place him in a public school’s ‘special class’ for chil-\ndren with far more severe and persuasive disabilities. Again, the only\navailable option appears to be placement in a specialized private\nschool for intelligent children with significant learning disabilities,\nsuch as Summit School.\" (J.A. 709 (emphasis added).) At the May 30\n    3\n    Indeed, AB’s report card for the 1999-2000 school year evidences that\nhe earned primarily A’s, B’s and C’s (he earned a single D in \"communi-\ncat[ing] mathematical concepts and ideas\" for one of four marking peri-\nods). (J.A. 688.) He received \"satisfactory\" and \"very good\" marks for\nall of his classes. (J.A. 688.) His reading level, however, was found to\nbe below average during each of the four marking periods. (J.A. 688.)\nHis teacher noted that \"[AB] is a pleasure to have in class. He is quick\nto participate in group discussion,\" and further added that he was a \"de-\nlight\" who \"comes to class prepared and participates regularly.\" She\npointed out at various points, that he had difficulty with spelling, and\nduring the third marking period when he received the D that he had diffi-\nculty communicating math concepts. (J.A. 689-90.) During the final\nmarking period, however, she stated \"[n]ice improvement in math, [AB]\"\nas the communication mark was a C and the rest of his math grades were\nB’s. AB was also promoted to the fifth grade at the end of the year. (J.A.\n688.)\n\f                           A.B. v. LAWSON                            9\nIEP meeting, at DB’s insistence supported by Dr. Antell and the KKI\nevaluation, the IEP Team agreed to further consider whether AB was\nalso learning disabled in reading. DB, however, denied AACPS’s\nrequest to conduct testing on an expedited basis because she con-\ntended the assessments already provided a basis for the diagnosis.\n\n   On June 6, 2000, DB filed another request for a due process hear-\ning, arguing that AB should be coded learning disabled in reading.\nAfter AACPS moved to dismiss the hearing request as premature,\nDB’s counsel withdrew her request for a hearing on July 27, 2000. On\nor around July 31, 2000, DB granted consent to conduct additional\ntesting.\n\n   On August 12, 2000, AACPS administered the Lindamood Audi-\ntory Conceptualization (LAC) test to AB. The test showed that AB\ncould read and spell at approximately the third grade level and his\n\"phonemic ability\" was not fully developed. On August 15, 2000, DB\nnotified AACPS that she would be placing AB in the Summit School\nfor the 2000-2001 school year at AACPS’s expense. On August 23,\n2000, AACPS administered the Wechsler Individual Achievement\nTest to AB. That test found reading difficulties; AB scored approxi-\nmately two years below his grade level on each of the tests.\n\n   AB enrolled in and attended the Summit School for the 2000-01\nschool year. On August 30, 2000, counsel for AACPS notified DB’s\ncounsel that an IEP meeting was scheduled for September 11, 2000,\nhowever, at DB’s request the meeting was pushed back one month to\naccommodate Dr. Antell. At the October meeting, the IEP Team\ndefined AB as having a learning disability in the area of reading in\naddition to the already identified disability in written expression.\nAACPS presented an IEP plan whereby AB would attend 31.25 hours\nof general (integrated) education per week and various forms of spe-\ncial education each day, amounting to 9.0 hours of special education\neach week. DB requested time to review the IEP. On October 17,\n2000, Dr. Antell wrote AACPS again, contesting the IEP’s suffi-\nciency and requesting that it provide AB with (among other things):\nbooks on tape, a reader, a note taker, extra time for math assignments,\noral presentations of math lessons, a dictation system or similar appa-\nratus and other accommodations.\n\f10                          A.B. v. LAWSON\n   Again, per DB’s request, the IEP meeting was scheduled for\nNovember 29, 2000. At the November 29 IEP meeting, the Team con-\nsidered Dr. Antell’s letter as well as a speech/language pathology\nevaluation from April 2000, which DB presented for the first time.\nDB additionally requested that AB be placed in a full-day special edu-\ncation program. The IEP Team agreed to review the April 2000 evalu-\nation and discuss it at a follow-up meeting.\n\n   On February 8, 2001, DB proposed that an IEP meeting be held on\nMarch 14, 2001, and she stated that Dr. Joan McCarthy of the Summit\nSchool would attend. At the March 14, 2001 meeting, the IEP Team\nsubmitted a revised IEP which called for 10.5 hours of special educa-\ntion. DB again declined to accept the IEP because it did not entail\nfull-time special education. Dissatisfied with AACPS’s proposal, DB\nleft AB enrolled at the Summit School and pursued her challenge to\nthe proposed IEP through a due process hearing.\n\n                                   C.\n\n  On May 23 and June 6, 2001, an ALJ conducted the due process\nhearing at AACPS’s offices in Annapolis to consider (1) whether the\nIEP offered by AACPS for the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school\nyears was reasonably calculated to provide a FAPE; and (2) if not,\nwhether DB should be reimbursed for the cost of the Summit School.\nAt the hearing, the ALJ admitted fifty-eight exhibits and heard testi-\nmony from eight witnesses.\n\n   On July 12, 2001, the ALJ issued an order holding that both IEPs\nwere reasonably calculated to offer a FAPE and denying DB’s request\nfor reimbursement. In issuing its order, the ALJ considered the par-\nties’ joint stipulated findings of fact, as presented at the hearing, and\nmade numerous additional findings of fact based on a preponderance\nof the evidence. The ALJ first dismissed DB’s claim that her son had\nbeen improperly evaluated and coded by AACPS, stating there was\n\"no evidence presented at the hearing to show that the evaluation pro-\ncess was flawed, that the Parent was not provided with a meaningful\nopportunity to participate, or that any factors or considerations pre-\nsented by the Parent were not duly considered during the process.\"\nALJ Op. at 24 (J.A. 29).\n\f                           A.B. v. LAWSON                            11\n   DB’s claim rested on her assumption that AACPS should have\nimmediately coded her son as learning disabled based on the KKI\nevaluation. Indeed, the ALJ considered DB’s claim that the lengthy\nevaluation process impacted her child’s academic progress, and found\nthe measures taken by AACPS to diagnose the child were proper,\nalbeit lengthy. ALJ Op. at 24-25 (J.A. 29-30). The ALJ held that\n\"AACPS was not required to rely on the [KKI] report,\" noting that the\nresponsibility to determine whether a student is eligible for special\neducation is the responsibility of the IEP Team. ALJ Op. at 26-27\n(J.A. 31-32).\n\n   The ALJ concluded that the IEP was \"reasonably calculated\" to\nprovide AB educational benefit, citing IDEA’s mandate that \"to the\nmaximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities be educated\nwith children who are not disabled.\" ALJ Op. at 33-34 (J.A. 38-39).\nIn holding that the proposed IEP offered a FAPE, the ALJ credited\nthe testimony of AACPS’s experts, finding that the child did not\nrequire all-day special education and that the proposed IEP offered\nthe least restrictive means of conferring educational benefit to the\nchild. The judge cited AACPS’s expert testimony, which she credited,\nfinding that the Summit School program was \"overly restrictive.\" ALJ\nOp. at 29 (internal quotation marks omitted) (J.A. 34). Thus, the ALJ\nrejected the views of DB and her experts, who had maintained that\nAB required an entire school day with special educational services.\nIn so holding, she rejected DB’s contention that the child must \"be\nplaced in a private school that serves only students with learning dis-\nabilities.\" (J.A. 41.)\n\n   In supporting her holding that the IEP offered a FAPE, the ALJ\nnoted her reliance on testimony from Millersville personnel as well\nas evidence of AB’s educational progress as measured by his report\ncard and teacher’s comments. ALJ Op. at 30-31 (J.A. 35-36). In\nreviewing such data, the ALJ noted that AB’s reading ability\nincreased nearly two grade levels while attending Millersville despite\nthe fact that he was not receiving special education. See ALJ Opinion\nat 29 (J.A. 34). On the basis of such evidence, the ALJ concluded\n\"there is no indication that the Child’s needs cannot be met at Millers-\nville Elementary School.\" ALJ Op. at 30 (J.A. 35). The ALJ con-\ncluded that under IDEA, \"[t]he issue is not whether the Summit\nSchool is better, or even appropriate, but whether AACPS has offered\n\f12                         A.B. v. LAWSON\n. . . an appropriate program for the Child at Millersville Elementary.\"\nALJ Op. at 36-37 (J.A. 41-42). In denying DB’s claim, the ALJ\nacknowledged that while she appreciated DB’s concern that given\nAB’s high IQ, he should have performed at a greater academic level\nat Millersville and in contrast was \"thriving\" at the Summit School,\nALJ Op. at 30 (J.A. 35), \"IDEA does not require a program that\nwould maximize a student’[s] potential, but instead simply a program\nthat is appropriate,\" id. at 36 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted) (J.A. 41).\n\n                                  D.\n\n   On January 8, 2002, DB filed a complaint in the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the District of Maryland, appealing the ALJ’s decision\nand requesting declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to IDEA, 20\nU.S.C. §§ 1400, et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and\n42 U.S.C. § 1983. After cross-motions for summary judgment, the\nmagistrate judge granted summary judgment for the Bs, holding that\nAACPS’s IEPs did not offer a FAPE. The court further ordered that\nAACPS reimburse DB for the costs of Summit School for the 2000-\n2001 and 2001-2002 school years, holding that the Summit School\nprovided the least restrictive means of providing a FAPE.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   Ordinarily, we review a district court’s grant of summary judgment\nde novo, applying the same standards employed by the district court.\nU.S. Search, LLC v.

AACPS contends that, as the ALJ held, the IEP\nfor the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 school years was (1) reasonably\ncalculated to offer a FAPE and (2) it was the least restrictive environ-\nment for the child. We consider these arguments in turn. Overarching\nall of Appellants’ arguments is their contention that the district court\nerred in failing to accord the ALJ’s findings proper deference. See\ngenerally Appellants’ Br. at 27-32. Appellees counter that the district\ncourt properly deviated from the ALJ’s findings of fact and \"made\nfactual findings and legal conclusions de novo, with explicit reasons\ntherefore.\" Appellees’ Br. at 22. They argue that AACPS’s proposed\nIEPs did not offer AB a FAPE. Appellees further contend that the IEP\nwas not the least restrictive environment, because — despite outward\nappearances — \"[AB] did not make progress in the general education\nsetting.\" Id. at 33.\n\n   We find Appellees’ arguments wholly unconvincing. The district\ncourt ignored the principles animating IDEA and wrongfully dis-\nmissed the ALJ’s findings of fact. The district court substituted its\nown views on educational policy — and those of DB and her experts\n— for the determinations of the local education officials charged with\nformulating an IEP. Accordingly, we reverse the district court and\nhold that the ALJ correctly recognized that AACPS offered AB an\nIEP that was reasonably calculated to provide him some educational\n\f14                          A.B. v. LAWSON\nbenefit, thus providing a FAPE and satisfying IDEA’s modest\nrequirements. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 203-04; MM, 303 F.3d at 532.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   In Tice v.

Neither the district court nor\nthis court should disturb an IEP simply because we disagree with its\ncontent. . . . [W]e wholeheartedly agree that once education authori-\nties have made a professional judgment about the substantive content\nof a child’s IEP, that judgment must be respected.\" Id. at 1207-08\n(internal citations omitted).4 The ALJ recognized that the IEP Team’s\ndeterminations concerning AB’s eligibility for special education ser-\nvices were, by law, \"solely the responsibility of the IEP team.\" ALJ\nOp. at 32 (citing 34 C.F.R. § 300.532(a); Md. Regs. Code tit. 13A\n  4\n    Here, there is some controversy concerning whether DB properly pre-\nsented a substantive or a procedural challenge to the IEP at the adminis-\ntrative hearing. Significantly, the ALJ framed the questions on review as\nsubstantive challenges. See ALJ Op. at 2 (J.A. 7). Yet even if the Bs had\nproperly lodged their procedural challenge, the ALJ noted there was \"no\nevidence presented at the hearing to show the evaluation process\n[employed by AACPS] was flawed, that the parent was not provided\nwith a meaningful opportunity to participate . . . .\" ALJ Op. at 24 (J.A.\n29). The ALJ also concluded \"there were no procedural errors in this pro-\ncess.\" ALJ Op. at 27 (J.A. 32). On appeal, Appellees seem to admit that\nthey had not directly acknowledged a procedural violation, but because\nAB was denied learning disabled status during 1999-2000 it \"contributed\nto his need for full special ed[ucation] placement\" and \"the procedural\nand substantive violations are inextricably intertwined.\" Appellees’ Br.\nat 41. Regardless, we find that while AACPS’s coding process may not\nhave issued with the speed to which school districts should aspire, no\nprocedural violation was present. Indeed, as the ALJ found and as recited\nin the facts above, ante, the delays in coding AB and formulating an IEP\nare often directly attributable to the parent and her experts. Emblematic\nof the delays occasioned by DB was her presentation by ambush of a\nspeech/language pathology evaluation at the November 29, 2000 IEP\nmeeting, though that evaluation had been completed seven months ear-\nlier.\n\f                             A.B. v. LAWSON                              15\n§ 05.01.06) (additional citation omitted) (J.A. 32). As such, the ALJ\nfound the Team crafted an IEP reasonably calculated to provide AB\nwith some educational benefit and that AACPS officials made profes-\nsional judgments in accord with federal and Maryland regulations.\nThe ALJ correctly noted that the AACPS IEP Team considered a lit-\nany of factors concerning AB’s educational background, and pro-\nposed an IEP that focused on the child’s difficulties in reading and\nwriting, providing him with individualized services to improve in\nthose areas. Further, the ALJ found that the proposed IEPs reflected\nthe studied determinations of AACPS’s experts that the child did not\nrequire intensive special education in a segregated classroom. Finally,\nthe ALJ correctly and explicitly held that under IDEA, the AACPS\nIEP Team was not required to rely on the KKI report and complied\nwith state and federal law. ALJ Op. at 27-28 (J.A. 32-33).5\n\n                                    C.\n\n   DB has nonetheless continuously maintained that the proposed\nIEPs did not offer a FAPE because AB did not make progress in the\ngeneral educational setting. DB and her experts assert that AB would\nregress in general education, and that he required full-time special\neducation services. Undergirding all of DB’s arguments are her\nclaims that because AB, a child of above-average IQ, was not fulfill-\ning his potential within a general education setting — and, in contrast,\nallegedly was \"thriving\" and \"getting the help he needs\" at the Sum-\nmit School — AACPS was not in compliance with IDEA. Although,\nas discussed above, nowhere does IDEA require that a school system\n\"maximize\" a student’s potential, Rowley, 458 U.S. at 189, the district\ncourt ignored the findings of the ALJ and adopted DB’s contrary\nreading of the statute.\n  5\n    In contending that AACPS should have determined AB was learning\ndisabled solely on the basis of KKI, Appellees’ argument squarely con-\nflicts with the statutory language of IDEA. The statute provides that dur-\ning the IEP evaluation process, the school district \"shall . . . not use any\nsingle procedure as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is\na child with a disability or determining an appropriate educational pro-\ngram . . . .\" 20 U.S.C. § 1414(b)(2). Additionally, the IEP Team has full\ndiscretion to \"identify what additional data, if any, are needed to deter-\nmine . . . whether the child needs special education and related services\n. . . .\" Id. § 1414(c)(1)(B)(iii).\n\f16                           A.B. v. LAWSON\n   Whereas the ALJ found that the IEP was formulated to meet AB’s\neducational needs and a general education setting was appropriate\nbecause, in part, \"the Child made educational progress during the aca-\ndemic year he spent at Millersville, albeit not as great as the Parent\nhad hoped for,\" ALJ Op. at 30-31 (J.A. 35-36), the district court con-\nsistently reached diametrically opposing conclusions, see e.g., Dist.\nCt. Op. at 19 (J.A. 73) (\"[AB] require[s] full-time placement in spe-\ncial education services in order to make educational progress and to\nobtain some benefit\"); id. at 20 (J.A. 74) (\"[AB] would have regressed\nrather than progressed were [AACPS’s proposed IEP] to have been\nimplemented.\").\n\n    Appellees contend, however, that the district court properly dis-\ncarded the ALJ’s factual findings in reversing the administrative\nbody. However, we find the district court repudiated the findings of\nthe ALJ and discarded the expertise of the IEP Team without reason\nor explanation. Instead, the district court simply adopted the world-\nview of DB’s experts and their perspectives on proper educational\npolicy. Nowhere did the district court try to square its findings with\nthose of the ALJ, although in this circuit the determination of whether\nan IEP is appropriate is a question of fact. See DiBuo v.

Nor did the district court explain how it, despite the fact\nthat it was reviewing a cold record, reached a conclusion completely\ncontrary to that of the ALJ, who conducted the proceedings. See\nDoyle, 953 F.2d at 105 (noting that the district court \"if it is not going\nto follow [the ALJ’s findings of fact], is required to explain why it\ndoes not\"). Rather than providing the required explanations, the dis-\ntrict court substituted its own credibility assessments for those of the\nALJ, stating only that it found \"the testimony provided by AACPS to\nhave been externally and internally inconsistent, generally garbled\nand aimed primarily at self-justification. The testimony on behalf of\nthe plaintiffs, in contrast, was clear and consistent. . . . [T]he court\nfinds wholly competent the assessments from the plaintiffs’ witnesses\n. . . and incompetent the assessment from AACPS.\" Dist. Ct. Op. at\n18 (J.A. 72).6\n  6\n   In purported support of their argument that the district court was cor-\nrect to jettison the ALJ’s findings, Appellees cite a case that is contrary\n\f                             A.B. v. LAWSON                               17\n   In doing so, the district court disregarded the ALJ’s resolution of\nconflicting expert testimony. The ALJ carefully considered the views\nof DB’s experts Drs. Antell and McCarthy, implicitly finding them\nunconvincing while crediting the contrary views of AACPS’s experts.7\nDespite the ALJ’s findings, the district court’s opinion rests almost\nentirely upon a voluminous discussion of Drs. Antell and McCarthy’s\ntestimony. See Dist. Ct. Op. at 5-14 (J.A. 59-68). The district court\nthus reached factual conclusions entirely irreconcilable with those of\nthe ALJ. E.g., \"[C]hildren with superior intelligence and learning dis-\norders require special treatment in a special classroom setting;\" \"addi-\ntional testing that was performed by AACPS was unnecessary;\" \"what\n[AB] needed could not . . . be done at this point in an inclusion class-\nroom or general ed classroom;\" \"[AB] not only could not succeed but\nwould degenerate in a general education setting;\" \"an appropriate IEP\ncould not be implemented at Millersville because the school did not\nhave the ability to integrate all of the goals in every classroom, in\nevery subject, with every teacher.\" The district court fully adopted Dr.\nMcCarthy’s testimony that \"placement at Summit was ‘absolutely’\nthe least restrictive environment in which [AB] could learn and reiter-\n\nto their position. See Appellees’ Br. at 19-20 (citing Arlington County\nSch. Bd. v.

While the dis-\ntrict court in Arlington County did reverse the ALJ decision, it did so\nbecause \"the hearing officer succumbed to the temptation which exists\nfor judges and hearing officers alike in IDEA cases, to make his own\nindependent judgment as to the best placement . . . instead of relying on\nthe record evidence presented in the hearing\" and \"defer[ring] to educa-\ntors’ decisions as long as the IEP provided the child the basic floor of\nopportunity . . . .\" Id. at 713, 715 (citations omitted). Here, precisely the\nopposite situation occurred. The ALJ made the factual finding that a\nproper IEP had been formulated, yet the district court, like the hearing\nofficer in Arlington County, succumbed to its temptation to inject itself\ninto matters of professional educational judgment.\n   7\n     For example, the ALJ stated that DB claimed the IEP goals drafted\nby Dr. McCarthy were the \"only appropriate ones for the Child,\" and\nnoted that Drs. McCarthy and Antell \"testified in great detail as to the\ninferiority of the AACPS IEP and the superiority of the special education\nservices that the Child is receiving at the Summit School.\" ALJ Op. at\n24 (J.A. 29). Yet the ALJ reached a completely opposite result, holding\nthat the IEP complied with IDEA.\n\f18                           A.B. v. LAWSON\nated that placing [AB] in a general education setting was not appro-\npriate\" although that assessment was flatly contradicted by AACPS’s\nexperts which the ALJ credited. Dist. Ct. Op. at 14 (J.A. 68).\n\n   In its sweeping dismissal of the ALJ’s findings — with little expla-\nnation other than that on the basis of a cold record it found their\nexperts \"generally garbled and aimed primarily at self-justification\"\n— the district court wholly disregarded IDEA’s mandate that it\n\"leave[ ] the substance and the details of [the proper education for a\ndisabled child] to state and local officials.\" Barnett v.

However, the district court failed\nto apply the proper standard of review to the ALJ’s findings and\nincorrectly applied IDEA’s FAPE standard.\n\n   First, the district court did not apply the proper standard in deter-\nmining whether the IEP at Millersville would provide an educational\nbenefit, rather it essentially assessed \"whether the IEP would replicate\nthe benefit to [AB] of the [Summit School program], which [the dis-\ntrict court found] successful for him.\" G ex rel.

Bragg\nDependent Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253, amended on reh’g, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(4th Cir. 2003). The district court ignored the fact that the ALJ found\nthat AB was obtaining \"some educational benefit\" at AACPS even\nwhen he was receiving no special education. See ALJ Op. at 29 (not-\ning AB’s reading level had increased nearly two grade levels while\nat Millersville) (J.A. 34); id. at 30-31 (\"the Child made educational\nprogress during the academic year he spent at Millersville, albeit not\nas great as the Parent had hoped for\") (J.A. 35-36).8 Yet the district\ncourt did not even bother to refer to the ALJ’s findings that AB made\nprogress at Millersville, rather the Magistrate Judge simply accepted\n— contrary to the findings of fact and weight of the evidence — Dr.\nMcCarthy’s testimony that AB \"would degenerate in a general educa-\n  8\n    As discussed above, AB’s report card for his year at Millersville, ante\nn.3, also supports the ALJ’s findings. See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207 n.28\n(recognizing that \"achievement of passing marks and advancement from\ngrade to grade\" are \"important factor[s] in determining educational bene-\nfit\").\n\f                             A.B. v. LAWSON                              19\ntional setting.\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 13 (J.A. 67); see also id. at 20 (\"the\nCourt is convinced that the final IEP offered by AACPS for [AB] was\nnot designed to confer some educational benefit upon him and, in\nfact, that [AB] would have regressed rather than progressed were such\na program to have been implemented\") (J.A. 74).\n\n   The district court not only evaded the ALJ’s findings without\nexplanation, but it also credited the testimony of Dr. McCarthy\nthough it was riddled with internal inconsistencies. Specifically, the\nMagistrate Judge chose to ignore that Dr. McCarthy acknowledged\nthat AB had \"at minimum a satisfactory year\" academically at Mil-\nlersville. (J.A. 353.) Indeed, that admission completely refutes the dis-\ntrict court’s favored reading of Dr. McCarthy’s testimony, and wholly\nsupports the ALJ’s finding that AACPS offered a FAPE.\n\n   Appellees, however, have contended in their briefs and at oral\nargument that the district court gave proper deference to the ALJ’s\nfindings because the court’s 180-degree turn stemmed from \"unsup-\nported weight afforded to evidence (rather than on the credibility of\nwitnesses).\" Appellees’ Br. at 26-27. Appellees’ arguments indicate\nthat they simply do not understand the role of the fact finder. For they\nstate: \"The ALJ’s failure to consider significant parts of testimony\nand exhibits is doubly of concern. . . . For example, the administrative\ndecision literally only mentions Dr. Antell in passing, though the dis-\ntrict court opinion chiefly relies upon this expert’s testimony, and\nquotes her opinions in unabridged detail.\" Appellees’ Br. at 26 n.8\n(emphasis added). Appellees appear oblivious that this is precisely the\nrole of a fact finder. The ALJ heard extensive testimony from Drs.\nAntell and McCarthy who claimed the IEP did not offer a FAPE, yet\nin holding that AACPS provided a FAPE and resting its opinion on\nan entirely contrary body of expert testimony, the ALJ obviously\nfound the testimony of Appellees’ experts unpersuasive. In essence,\nAppellees’ argument is reducible to the sour grapes claim that the\nALJ was simply wrong in failing to rely on the testimony of Drs.\nAntell and McCarthy. Accordingly, that argument merely illustrates\njust how far the district court had to deviate from the ALJ’s findings\nto reach its result.9\n  9\n   Additionally, Appellees argue, relying on Springer v. Fairfax County\nSch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751115\"><a href=\"/opinion/751115/edward-p-springer-a-minor-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-edward-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 663 n.* (4th Cir. 1998), that the district court did\n\f20                           A.B. v. LAWSON\n   In \"chiefly relying\" on Dr. Antell’s testimony, the district court\nadopted DB’s preferred reading of what IDEA requires. DB and her\nexperts testified before the ALJ they believed the Summit School\nenvironment was \"ideal;\" AB was \"thriving\" and \"getting the help he\nneeds there;\" and \"given his high IQ, he should be performing at a\nmuch greater academic level than he has done in the past.\" ALJ Op.\nat 30 (internal quotation marks omitted) (J.A. 35). However, as the\nALJ recognized, but the district court ignored, this is not what IDEA\nrequires. Indeed, \"[t]he issue is not whether the Summit School is bet-\nter, or even appropriate, but whether AACPS has offered . . . an\nappropriate program for the Child at Millersville Elementary.\" ALJ\nOp. at 37 (J.A. 42). As discussed above, IDEA’s FAPE standards are\nfar more modest than to require that a child excel or thrive. The\nrequirement is satisfied when the state provides the disabled child\nwith \"personalized instruction with sufficient support services to per-\nmit the child to benefit educationally from the instruction.\" Rowley,\n458 U.S. at 203; accord MM, 303 F.3d at 526-27; Hartmann, 118\nF.3d at 1001. In this case, the record shows that AACPS’s proposed\nIEPs offered AB a FAPE.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n   Given that we find the district court erred in overturning the ALJ’s\nfindings that the IEP provided a FAPE, it follows a fortiori that the\n\nnot need to accord the ALJ’s findings any deference because the \"admin-\nistrative decision assigns an inaccurate degree of weight to critical evi-\ndence,\" and the ALJ decision was \"cursory and conclusory.\" Appellees’\nBr. at 25-26. Springer, however, is readily distinguishable from this case.\nIn Springer, the local hearing officer did not rely on expert testimony but\n\"[r]el[ied] exclusively on a letter written by a psychiatrist.\" 134 F.3d at\n662 (emphasis added). Here, however, the ALJ conducted a formal hear-\ning and considered witness testimony and multiple exhibits. The ALJ\nwas in a far superior position to evaluate such witness testimony than the\ncourt below, which relied on a body of completely contrary testimony\nwithin the cold record. Springer is also distinguishable because the\ncourts were in a position identical to the local hearing officer in evaluat-\ning the letter — a document within a cold record — upon which the offi-\ncer’s decision was based. Moreover, the ALJ’s opinion here is anything\nbut conclusory and cursory. To the contrary, the ALJ made extensive\nfactual findings and applied governing precedent \"explain[ing] the result\nwith some care\" as Springer, supra, requires.\n\f                           A.B. v. LAWSON                            21\nAACPS IEP, with its integrated curriculum, was less restrictive than\nthe wholly segregated Summit School. IDEA requires mainstreaming\nthat Summit School does not provide. 20 U.S.C. 1412(5)(B); see\nDeVries, 882 F.2d at 876. While the district court stated that it was\n\"mindful of the Congressional preference for mainstreaming,\" Dist.\nCt. Op. at 19 (J.A. 73), its holding that only the wholly segregated\neducational environment that Summit provided offered a FAPE\nrefutes such purported mindfulness. The district court held that AB\nrequired a \"full-time placement\" in a program with learning disabled\nchildren of \"above-average intelligence,\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 19 (J.A. 73).\nThe lower court then took judicial notice of a Learning Dis-\nabled/Gifted and Talented Program designed for learning disabled\nstudents with high cognitive ability in Montgomery County. Id. at 19\nn.3. In holding that the appropriate placement for AB was \"full-time\nplacement in special education services . . . with children of above-\naverage intelligence,\" the court erroneously substituted its judgment\nfor those of education professionals. MM, supra; Rowley, supra. The\ndistrict court’s holding bears repeating: the Magistrate Judge found\nthe least restrictive way — indeed the only way — to educate AB was\nto place him in a wholly segregated special education classroom in\nwhich students were also \"gifted and talented,\" while also forcing\nAACPS to pay for such a placement. At minimum, the district court\nshowed no \"reluctan[ce] to second-guess professional educators\" at\nAACPS. MM, 303 F.3d at 532.\n\n   First, there was no evidence in the record as to whether AACPS\nhad such a Gifted and Talented program for learning disabled students\nin which AB could be enrolled. Additionally, there was no evidence\nin the record showing that AB would be devoid of interaction with\nchildren of \"above-average intelligence\" in classes at Millersville.\nFinally, there was no evidence in the record regarding the program at\nColonel E. Brooke Lee Middle School, which the district court so\nreadily endorsed, despite the fact that AB was an elementary school\nstudent during the period at issue. Regardless of the educational effi-\ncacy of that program, or the schooling at Summit, the FAPE analysis\namounts to whether the AACPS IEP was reasonably calculated to con-\nfer some educational benefit. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(17); MM, 303 F.3d\nat 532. In applying the wrong standard, the district court \"substi-\ntut[ed] [its] own notions of sound educational policy for those of local\n\f22                          A.B. v. LAWSON\nschool authorities.\" MM, 303 F.3d at 531 (internal quotation and cita-\ntion omitted).\n\n   Even after skewing the proper analysis of whether AACPS pro-\nvided some educational benefit, the district court still had to ignore\nthe ALJ’s factual findings regarding Summit to reach its result. The\ndistrict court first disregarded the ALJ’s clear factual finding that AB\nhad \"mixed\" results at Summit.10 Instead, the district court conclu-\nsorily stated that at Summit: \"[AB] vaulted three grade levels in math-\nematics, which tends to support the assessments of Drs. Antell and\nMcCarthy that the alternative strategies employed at Summit, and not\nrecommended by AACPS, were working and were permitting AB to\nobtain some benefit . . . .\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 19 (J.A. 73). In relying on\nthis evidence and making such a determination, the district court\nmade no mention of AB’s inconsistent progress at Summit in the\nareas of reading and written language — the very areas in which all\nparties agree that he was learning disabled. Indeed, the record consis-\ntently reflects that throughout his educational history, AB regularly\nscored above his age and grade level in mathematics.\n\n   In sum, the magistrate judge ignored the congressional preference\nfor mainstreaming, clearly and strongly substituted its views on edu-\ncation and IDEA for that of Congress, and failed to accord the ALJ’s\nfactual findings the requisite degree of deference. In reversing the\nALJ, the district court consistently failed to heed \"IDEA’s recognition\nthat federal courts cannot run local schools. Local educators deserve\nlatitude in determining the individualized education program most\nappropriate for a disabled child. The IDEA does not deprive these\neducators of the right to apply their professional judgment.\" Hart-\nmann, 118 F.3d at 1001. As the ALJ determined, the AACPS IEP\noffered an integrated education, and AB had already made progress\nwithin that setting.11\n  10\n     The ALJ found AB’s performance in math at Summit was \"solid\" but\n\"his performance in written language and reading/language arts was\ninconsistent . . . .\" ALJ Op. at 18 (J.A. 23).\n  11\n     As a final attempt to support its finding that the Summit School was\nthe least restrictive placement, the district court again ventured outside\nthe record to state \"that not all the students at Summit have been defined\n\f                            A.B. v. LAWSON                            23\n                                   V.\n\n   Because we hold that AACPS offered AB a FAPE, the issue of\nreimbursement under Burlington, supra, and Florence County Sch.\nDist. Four v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112910\"><a href=\"/opinion/112910/florence-county-school-dist-four-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993), is clearly inapplicable.\n\n                                  VI.\n\n   For the reasons stated above, we reverse the judgment of the dis-\ntrict court and remand with instructions that the district court enter\nsummary judgment in favor of AACPS. Accordingly, we also vacate\nthe district court’s order that AACPS reimburse DB for the costs of\neducating her son at the Summit School during the 2000-2001 and\n2001-2002 school years.\n\n                                        REVERSED AND REMANDED\n\nby their school systems as learning disabled.\" Dist. Ct. Op. at 20. (J.A.\n74.) This finding, however, is a strawman. The magistrate judge had\nalready determined that \"not only did [AB] require full-time placement\nin special education services in order to make educational progress and\nto obtain some benefit from education services but also that the appro-\npriate placement was and is with children of above-average intelli-\ngence.\" Id. (emphasis added). Neither party disputed that Summit was a\nsegregated learning disabled-exclusive school, and indeed Summit’s own\npublications support that finding.
