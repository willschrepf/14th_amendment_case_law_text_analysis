No. S-16-807.\n\n                1.\t Divorce: Child Custody: Child Support: Property Division:\n                     Alimony: Attorney Fees: Appeal and Error. In a marital dissolution\n                     action, an appellate court reviews the case de novo on the record to\n                     determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion by the trial\n                     judge. This standard of review applies to the trial court’s determinations\n                     regarding custody, child support, division of property, alimony, and\n                     attorney fees.\n                2.\t Evidence: Appeal and Error. In a review de novo on the record, an\n                     appellate court is required to make independent factual determina-\n                     tions based upon the record, and the court reaches its own independent\n                     conclusions with respect to the matters at issue. When evidence is in\n                     conflict, the appellate court considers and may give weight to the fact\n                     that the trial court heard and observed the witnesses and accepted one\n                     version of the facts rather than another.\n                3.\t Judges: Words and Phrases. A judicial abuse of discretion exists if the\n                     reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriv-\n                     ing a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in matters\n                     submitted for disposition.\n                4.\t Judgments: Appeal and Error. When reviewing questions of law, an\n                     appellate court has an obligation to resolve the questions independently\n                     of the conclusion reached by the trial court.\n                5.\t Divorce: Property Division. The ultimate test in determining the appro-\n                     priateness of the division of property is fairness and reasonableness as\n                     determined by the facts of each case.\n                 6.\t ____: ____. Under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 42-365 (Reissue 2016), the equi-\n                     table division of property is a three-step process. The first step is to clas-\n                     sify the parties’ property as marital or nonmarital, setting aside the non-\n                     marital property to the party who brought that property to the marriage.\n                     The second step is to value the marital assets and marital liabilities\n\f                                      - 340 -\n              Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                      298 Nebraska R eports\n                        OSANTOWSKI v. OSANTOWSKI\n                            Cite as 298 Neb. 339\n\n      of the parties. The third step is to calculate and divide the net marital\n      estate between the parties in accordance with the principles contained in\n      § 42-365.\n  7.\t ____: ____. Generally, all property accumulated and acquired by either\n      spouse during a marriage is part of the marital estate. Exceptions\n      include property that a spouse acquired before the marriage, or by gift\n      or inheritance.\n 8.\t Divorce: Appeal and Error. Appeals in domestic relations matters are\n      heard de novo on the record, and thus, an appellate court is empow-\n      ered to enter the order which should have been made as reflected by\n      the record.\n 9.\t Agriculture: Crops: Animals. Agricultural crops are categorically dif-\n      ferent in nature from a herd of cattle and, therefore, are not entitled to\n      the same treatment for tracing purposes.\n10.\t Agriculture: Crops: Equity. Courts are allowed flexibility in their\n      treatment of stored and growing agricultural crops to account for the\n      equities of the situation.\n11.\t Property Division: Appeal and Error. As a general principle, the date\n      upon which a marital estate is valued should be rationally related to the\n      property composing the marital estate. The date of valuation is reviewed\n      for an abuse of the trial court’s discretion.\n12.\t Appeal and Error. Absent plain error, errors argued but not assigned\n      will not be considered on appeal.\n13.\t Appeal and Error: Words and Phrases. Plain error exists where there\n      is an error, plainly evident from the record but not complained of at\n      trial, which prejudicially affects a substantial right of a litigant and is of\n      such a nature that to leave it uncorrected would cause a miscarriage of\n      justice or result in damage to the integrity, reputation, and fairness of the\n      judicial process.\n14.\t Appeal and Error. Plain error may be asserted for the first time on\n      appeal or be noted by an appellate court on its own motion.\n15.\t Property Division. A nonowning spouse is entitled to some benefit\n      when marital funds have been expended to improve or reduce the debt\n      on the other spouse’s nonmarital property.\n16.\t Divorce: Property Division: Alimony. In dividing property and consid-\n      ering alimony upon a dissolution of marriage, a court should consider\n      four factors: (1) the circumstances of the parties, (2) the duration of the\n      marriage, (3) the history of contributions to the marriage, and (4) the\n      ability of the supported party to engage in gainful employment.\n17.\t ____: ____: ____. In addition to the specific criteria listed in Neb. Rev.\n      Stat. § 42-365 (Reissue 2016), in dividing property and considering\n      alimony upon a dissolution of marriage, a court should consider the\n\f                                   - 341 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                     298 Nebraska R eports\n                      OSANTOWSKI v.

As a general rule, a spouse should be awarded one-\n     third to one-half of the marital estate, the polestar being fairness and\n     reasonableness as determined by the facts of each case.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Seward County: James C.\nStecker, Judge.

However, we hold that the\ncourt erred in its division of certain marital assets and debts.\nTherefore, we affirm the district court’s order as modified by\nthis opinion.\n\n                    I. BACKGROUND\n  Brian and Dori were married on September 23, 2011, and\nseparated on or about May 26, 2014. Dori filed a dissolution\n\f                            - 342 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                  298 Nebraska R eports\n                  OSANTOWSKI v. OSANTOWSKI\n                      Cite as 298 Neb. 339\n\ncomplaint in June 2014. Trial was held on January 14 and\nFebruary 12, 2016.\n\n                      1. Parties’ M arriage\n   During the marriage, Brian resided primarily in Polk County,\nNebraska, at a residence owned by his parents. Dori main-\ntained a residence in Lincoln, Nebraska, until May 2013. Dori\ntestified that while she was living in Lincoln, she spent a\nminimum of three to four nights per week with Brian in Polk\nCounty during the academic year and full time during the sum-\nmers and other school breaks. As of May 2013, Dori resided in\nPolk County full time and commuted to Lincoln for her final\nsemester of school.\n   In September 2013, Dori held a master’s degree in ento-\nmology from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and\nwas enrolled in a doctoral program for plant health at UNL.\nShe testified that while she had originally intended to pur-\nsue a Ph.D. in entomology at South Dakota State University,\nshe enrolled in a program at UNL instead because Brian had\nobjected to the distance. Dori also stated that she changed\nher program to plant health so that she could gain a better\nunderstanding of agriculture in Nebraska and contribute to the\nOsantowski farming operation.\n   Dori received a scholarship and a stipend for her school and\nliving expenses. She also worked full time during the summers\nin Lincoln, earning between $8,000 and $20,000 in wages for\n2011, 2012, and 2013 each. Most of Dori’s income and schol-\narship money during the marriage went to tuition, insurance\npayments, payments for her motorcycle, commuting expenses,\nrent and utilities for the Lincoln apartment, and other living\nexpenses. She testified that Brian provided minimal financial\nsupport to her during the marriage, but what he did provide\nwas used for the household expenses she paid for the Polk\nCounty residence. In February 2014, Dori began working full\ntime for an annual salary of $75,000 and obtained medical and\ndental insurance for herself and Brian.\n\f                              - 343 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v. OSANTOWSKI\n                       Cite as 298 Neb. 339\n\n   Brian began farming in 2005. He has a farming operation\nwith his two brothers in and around Polk County. Under the\noperation, Brian and his brothers own equipment separately\nbut jointly acquire land, which is owned in equal thirds.\nEach brother, however, farms land independently and bears\nthe rental fees and input costs for his operation. Accordingly,\ncrops and expenses are completely separate and distinct to\neach individual.\n   Brian testified that he receives benefits from his family\nwhich increase the profitability of his farming operation,\nincluding: discounted rental rates of $150 to $200 per acre ver-\nsus the market rate of $300 to $400 per acre on the majority of\nthe land that he rents; the majority of his diesel fuel at no cost\nto him; and the sharing of equipment, labor, shop space, and\nvarious other expenses.\n   Dori testified that she made the following contributions\nto Brian’s farming operation: Brian would consult her about\nchemical and herbicide application and general soil welfare;\nshe created plat maps for all of the Osantowski fields to keep\nfield spray records and to help plan for the future; she scouted\nfields for weed growth; she picked up parts and ran errands;\nand she went with Brian to check fields, pivots, and lay irri-\ngation pipe. Brian agreed that Dori performed these tasks\noccasionally, except he explained that the plat maps created\nby Dori were part of her summer employment and that when\nDori would ride with him to the fields, she did so because she\nenjoyed riding a “four-wheeler” and not because she actually\nhelped with irrigation.\n   Dori also testified that she performed all of the household\nduties at her Lincoln residence and that such duties in the Polk\nCounty residence were a team effort with Brian.\n                2. Evidence Offered at Trial\n  The parties offered into evidence two versions of a joint\nproperty statement, each listing premarital and marital debts\nand assets. One of the statements was dated May 18, 2015,\nand the other dated January 9, 2016. Each version listed the\n\f                             - 344 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                  OSANTOWSKI v. OSANTOWSKI\n                      Cite as 298 Neb. 339\n\nsame assets and debts; however, slightly different values were\nassigned to some. Additional documents were received into\nevidence to support the property statements, including per-\nsonal property appraisals from Grubaugh Auction Services,\nLLC; inventory reports from a certified public accountant;\ntax returns; settlement sheets from elevators; bank statements;\nretirement accounts; and balance sheets from several banks,\nincluding Great Western Bank.\n                 (a) Stored and Growing Crops\n   In regard to the premarital and marital crop inventory, Brian\ncalled Michael Hershberger as his expert witness to determine\nthe quantity of stored crops that Brian had on the date of mar-\nriage and on the date of separation. Hershberger is a certified\npublic accountant who works with agricultural clients on a\nregular basis. In reaching his conclusions on these issues,\nHershberger relied on Brian’s tax returns from 2011 to 2014;\nthe total annual yields in Brian’s crop insurance reports, which\nwere reported to him by Brian; two crop sales receipts; and\na spreadsheet summary of Brian’s recorded crop sales. The\nspreadsheet summary was prepared by Brian’s mother, who\ndoes all of Brian’s bookkeeping.\n   On the first day of trial, Hershberger gave testimony regard-\ning his determination of crop inventories and a report he\nauthored was received into evidence. However, that testi-\nmony and the exhibit were stricken from the record, because\nHershberger had relied on grain elevator receipts which were\nnot provided to Dori through discovery. After Brian supple-\nmented his discovery, Hershberger was again called to testify\nregarding the crop inventory.\n   In regard to the premarital crop inventory, Hershberger\nopined that Brian had a total of 57,156.26 bushels of corn\nin storage on September 23, 2011, and 91,296.09 bushels\nof corn and 10,405.99 bushels of soybeans ready for har-\nvest. On September 23, the price at the local elevator was\n$6.07 for a bushel of corn and $11.57 for a bushel of soy-\nbeans. Accordingly, Hershberger concluded that the fair market\n\f                             - 345 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                  OSANTOWSKI v. OSANTOWSKI\n                      Cite as 298 Neb. 339\n\nvalue on the date of marriage for Brian’s stored crops was\n$346,938.50 and his unharvested crops were $554,167.27 for\ncorn and $120,397.30 for soybeans, totaling $1,021,503.07.\nBased on the spreadsheet summary, he also concluded that\nBrian sold these crops for a total of $1,207,465.53.\n   Hershberger testified that he believed his estimation of the\ntotal bushels of crops produced in 2011 was very accurate,\nbecause Brian had claimed on his crop insurance report that a\ntotal of 91,863 bushels of corn and 10,151 bushels of soybeans\nwere produced.\n   In regard to the marital crop inventory, Hershberger con-\ncluded that the parties had 95,300.36 bushels of corn in storage\non the date of separation and that a bushel of corn sold for\n$4.66 on that day. Accordingly, he valued the corn in storage\non the date of separation as $444,099.68.\n   However, a balance sheet Brian had submitted to Great\nWestern Bank, dated March 20, 2014, stated that he had\n135,000 bushels of corn on hand which had a value of\n$573,750. Additionally, in Brian’s November 2014 response\nto Dori’s interrogatories, he stated that the March 20 balance\nsheet reflected the quantity and value of the stored crops. In\nboth joint property statements, Dori relied on the March 20\nbalance sheet for the quantity and value of crops that were\nmarital property.\n   In the May 2015 joint property statement, Brian failed to\nlist the quantity of crops in storage or assign a value thereto.\nBut in the January 2016 joint property statement, Brian listed\n14,862 bushels of corn in storage on the date of separation\nwith a value of $69,257. At trial, Brian testified that his\nJanuary 2016 estimation of the quantity of corn in storage\non the date of separation was based on Hershberger’s ini-\ntial analysis.\n   Hershberger admitted, however, that his opinions changed\ndramatically from the first day of trial to the second day of\ntrial. His valuation of the stored crops on the date of sepa-\nration changed from $69,259.25 to $444,099.68. While his\n\f                            - 346 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                  298 Nebraska R eports\n                  OSANTOWSKI v. OSANTOWSKI\n                      Cite as 298 Neb. 339\n\nvaluation of the stored and growing crops on the date of mar-\nriage changed from $898,603.04 to $1,021,503.07. Hershberger\nattributed these changes to his mistaken belief that all crops\nwere sold before the next harvest began. But after he requested\nthat Brian’s mother identify the year of production for each\ncrop at issue in the sale transactions on the spreadsheet sum-\nmary, his analysis changed.\n\n                   (b) Personal Property and\n                        Farm Equipment\n   Minimal testimony was elicited regarding the parties’ pre-\nmarital and marital personal property and farm equipment. The\njoint property statements set forth the items, and Brian and\nDori generally agreed to them. The values, however, were not\nagreed upon by the parties. A personal property and equipment\nappraisal was completed by Grubaugh Auction Services and\nwas received into evidence. The court generally adopted the\nvaluations established in that report.\n\n                         (c) Real Estate\n   In regard to real estate, the record shows that Brian owned\nfour parcels of real estate prior to the marriage as follows: a\none-third interest in the “NW1⁄4 [of] Section 8, Township 15\nNorth, Range 1 West[,] Butler County[, Nebraska]” (Bosshart/\nGruenwald farm); a one-third interest in the “SW1⁄4W1⁄2NW1⁄4\n[of] Section 4, Township 15 North, Range 1, Butler County”\n(Hondorfer farm); a one-third interest in the “W1⁄2NE1⁄4 [of]\nSection 8, Township 16 North[, Butler County]” (Dodendorf\nfarm); and a one-third interest in the “E1⁄2SE1⁄4 [of] Section\n13, Township 16 North, Range 1, Polk County” (Jahn farm).\nDuring the marriage, the parties purchased a one-third inter-\nest in the “SW1⁄4 of Section 10, Township 15 North, Range 2\nWest and the NW1⁄4 of Section 15, Township 15 North, Range\n2 West, Polk County” (Roberts farm). Secured debt was owed\nagainst each of the properties.\n\f                              - 347 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v. OSANTOWSKI\n                       Cite as 298 Neb. 339\n\n                       (d) Premarital Debt\n   In regard to the division of debt, there was no direct evidence\nof the value of Brian’s debts on September 23, 2011. However,\nBrian annually submitted balance sheets to Great Western Bank\nthat listed his debts and their value on the date of submission.\nThe balance sheets nearest to the date of marriage were dated\nDecember 8, 2010, and March 8, 2012. The parties relied on\nthe debts listed on the March 2012 balance sheet in their joint\nproperty statements, and the court awarded Brian the six debts\nlisted therein as premarital. The court, however, did not include\ncorresponding values to these debts.\n   Though the parties listed different amounts for certain debts,\nthe record indicates that the value of the premarital debts\nawarded to Brian are as follows: Great Western Bank 2010\noperating line of credit, $162,000; Great Western Bank loan\nfor a 2008 Mercury Milan, $6,927; Bosshart/Gruenwald farm\nsecured debt, $125,495; Dodendorf farm secured debt, $31,557;\n“Ag Direct” loan for a Cat Challenger tractor, $49,250; and\nHondorfer farm secured debt (Great Western Bank account No.\nxxx6688), $247,500. The six debts totaled $622,729.\n   Additionally, the record contains a 2011 “itemized catego-\nries report.” This report shows that Brian paid $296,046.69\nin expenses after the date of the marriage. Brian testified at\ntrial that each of these expenses were incurred for his 2011\ncrop, which he claimed as a premarital asset, and the court\nawarded him as such. Accordingly, these expenses were pre-\nmarital debts.\n   Therefore, Brian’s total premarital debts, as reflected in the\nrecord, were approximately $918,775.69.\n   Dori had a $7,000 debt to her father on the date of the mar-\nriage, and she was awarded this premarital debt by the court.\nThe court did not assign a value to this debt, but on the joint\nproperty statements, Dori listed its value at $7,000.

Trial Court’s Decree\n   In June 2016, the court issued its decree dissolving the par-\nties’ marriage and ordering the division of the marital estate.\nThe court determined values for most of the premarital and\nmarital assets it awarded.\n   The court awarded premarital assets to Dori, with a total\nvalue of $20,600, and to Brian, with a total value of $1,139,047.\nTwo of the premarital assets awarded to Brian were the value\nof his 2010 crops, sold in 2011, and his 2011 crops, sold in\n2012, but the court did not assign a value to these assets. It also\nawarded him the funds present on the date of the marriage in\nfour separate bank accounts.\n   However, the court found that all of Brian’s premarital crops\nhad been liquidated by the date of separation. It also found that\nBrian deposited the nonmarital proceeds from the liquidated\ncrops into his premarital bank accounts, along with the pro-\nceeds from the sale of the marital crops. Accordingly, the court\nfound that these premarital crops and monetary assets were\ncommingled with marital assets. Therefore, it ruled that Brian\nwas not entitled to a setoff from the marital estate for these\npremarital assets.\n   The court also rejected Brian’s argument that crops should\nbe treated similarly to a herd of cattle—as a single asset for\ntracing purposes. It reasoned that a herd of cattle is similar\nto land in that it is a self-sustaining and income producing.\nConversely, it stated that crops are an end product that is mar-\nketed and liquidated on a short-term basis to pay the expenses\nof producing it, purchase the seed used for the next crop’s\nproduction, purchase equipment, and provide the farmer his\nincome for the year. Accordingly, the court did not give Brian a\ncredit for any of the crops in storage on the date of separation;\ninstead, the court awarded Brian all of the crops in storage on\nthe date of separation at a value of $573,750.\n   The court listed the marital debt it awarded to Dori with a\ncorresponding value of $3,216. While the court also awarded\nseveral marital debts to Brian, it did not assign values to all\n\f                             - 349 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                  OSANTOWSKI v.

Nevertheless, the court summarized its award of the\nmarital estate as follows: Brian received $2,517,950 in mari-\ntal assets and $1,145,294 in marital debt for a total estate of\n$1,372,656; Dori received $21,611 in marital assets and $3,216\nin marital debt for a total estate of $18,395.\n   Regarding the equity of the distribution, the court found\nthat the marriage was of short duration and that neither party\ngave up employment or educational opportunities, but that Dori\ndid change her educational program to benefit the marriage.\nThe court rejected Brian’s argument that Dori should receive\nless than one-third of the marital assets. It reasoned that any\nfinancial benefit Brian brought to the relationship, above his\nincome, was as the landlord of the premarital property he\nfarmed and that the proper way to account for such a benefit\nwould have been to charge the marriage a cash rent or a crop-\nshare arrangement and segregate it as nonmarital property, of\nwhich Brian did not do or provide evidence.\n   The court ordered Brian to make an equalization payment of\n$680,000 to Dori, awarding about half of the marital estate to\neach party.\n   The court overruled Brian’s subsequent motion for new trial\nor to alter and amend the judgment. Brian appealed.\n\n                II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Brian assigns, restated and reordered, that the court erred\nin (1) failing to set off premarital property awarded to him\nfrom the marital estate; (2) failing to set off the value of his\npremarital stored and growing crops; (3) twice awarding him\nthe same $78,500 as marital property; (4) valuing the crops\nin storage 2 months prior to separation, when the vast major-\nity of the estate was valued as of the date of separation; (5)\nmaking significant mathematical errors in its division of the\nmarital estate; and (6) dividing the marital estate inequitably\nfor a marriage of short duration where the marital estate was\nalmost entirely due to the efforts and premarital contributions\nof one party.\n\f                                    - 350 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       298 Nebraska R eports\n                        OSANTOWSKI v.

This standard\nof review applies to the trial court’s determinations regard-\ning custody, child support, division of property, alimony, and\nattorney fees.1\n   [2] In a review de novo on the record, an appellate court\nis required to make independent factual determinations based\nupon the record, and the court reaches its own independent\nconclusions with respect to the matters at issue.2 However,\nwhen evidence is in conflict, the appellate court considers\nand may give weight to the fact that the trial court heard and\nobserved the witnesses and accepted one version of the facts\nrather than another.3\n   [3] A judicial abuse of discretion exists if the reasons or\nrulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriv-\ning a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in\nmatters submitted for disposition.4\n   [4] When reviewing questions of law, an appellate court\nhas an obligation to resolve the questions independently of the\nconclusion reached by the trial court.5\n\n                         IV.

The first step is to classify\nthe parties’ property as marital or nonmarital, setting aside the\nnonmarital property to the party who brought that property to\nthe marriage. The second step is to value the marital assets and\nmarital liabilities of the parties. The third step is to calculate\nand divide the net marital estate between the parties in accord­\nance with the principles contained in § 42-365.8\n            1.

However, it failed\nto include any credits for that amount. The court awarded\nBrian the 2010 and 2011 crops, but it did not determine a\nvalue for those crops. Brian claims that he used $80,000 from\nthe premarital crops for a downpayment on real estate pur-\nchased during the marriage, but that the court did not give him\ncredit for the $80,000.\n   Brian further contends that based on his testimony and\nthat of Hershberger, he had met his burden to trace the value\nof his crops on the date of marriage. In the alternative, he\nasserts that we should treat crops as a single unit for tracing\npurposes, as the Nebraska Court of Appeals did with live-\nstock in Shafer v. Shafer.15 He asserts that both livestock and\ncrops are biological commodities that are sustained through\nthe reinvestment of the proceeds from their sales and that\ncrops are not self-sustaining merely as a result of the propri-\netary nature of seeds which producers are contractually obli-\ngated to not replant. Accordingly, he asserts that we should\ndeduct the crops he had on the date of marriage from the\ncrops in storage on the date of separation and set it off from\nthe marital estate. Additionally, he argues that the $80,000\ndownpayment he made on the Roberts farm was traceable to\npremarital funds.\n   Dori contends that under our decision in Brozek v. Brozek,16\nthe court correctly found that Brian was not entitled to a setoff\nof his premarital crops or the proceeds from those crops and\nthe premarital funds in his accounts because they no longer\nexisted or had been commingled with marital assets at the\ntime of separation. She also argues that Brian is not cred-\nible and that therefore, Hershberger’s analysis should not be\nrelied on.\n\n15\t\n      Shafer v. Shafer, 16 Neb.

While Dori vigorously contested Brian’s credibil-\nity and Hershberger’s reliability, she presented no alterna-\ntive estimations. Further, Hershberger’s estimation of Brian’s\nstored crops and growing crops in 2011 was supported by\nthe crop insurance reports, tax returns, balance sheets, and\nsales receipts in the record. Exhibit 37 stated the value of\nBrian’s stored and growing crops on the date of marriage was\n$1,021,503.07.\n   [8] Appeals in domestic relations matters are heard de novo\non the record, and thus, an appellate court is empowered to\nenter the order which should have been made as reflected by\nthe record.17 Because the record shows the appropriate non-\nmarital value of these assets, we assign $1,021,503.07 as the\nvalue of Brian’s premarital stored and growing crops.\n                  (b) Crops Are Not Similar to\n                      Livestock for Tracing\n   In Sellers v. Sellers,18 we adopted the Court of Appeals’\nreasoning it posited in Shafer that a cattle herd owned at the\ntime of the marriage could, based on the totality of the circum-\nstances, be treated as a single asset for tracing purposes and set\noff from the marital estate as separate property if such a result\nwas equitable.\n   There, the husband had been engaged in the cattle business\nthroughout the marriage and continually reinvested the pro-\nceeds from the sale of cattle into the acquisition of new cattle.\nWe recognized that\n\n17\t\n      Schuman v.

As we stated in Brozek, a herd of cattle is generally\nself-sustaining, through reproduction and reinvestment, and is\nnot subject to depreciation, because it consistently maintains\nits number- and income-producing capabilities. Crops, on the\nother hand, are more similar to milk products produced by\na herd of dairy cattle. Both are short-term assets that are the\nproduct of investing input, maintenance, and equipment costs.\nThey are liquidated on a short-term basis and continuously\nrolled into production. While a crop cycle is longer and crops\nmay be stored for several years, crops, like milk products, are\nstill end products that account for the income of the individuals\nraising them.\n   [9] Brian’s argument that crops would be self-sustaining\nabsent contractual requirements to not replant is unavailing.\nEven if a crop could be used as a source of seed for replanting,\n\n19\t\n      Id. at 354, 882 N.W.2d at 711, quoting Shafer, supra note 15.\n20\t\n      Id. at 355, 882 N.W.2d at 712, quoting Shafer, supra note 15.\n21\t\n      Brozek, supra note 16.\n\f                                      - 355 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        298 Nebraska R eports\n                         OSANTOWSKI v.

Accordingly, we\nhold that agricultural crops are categorically different in nature\nfrom a herd of cattle and, therefore, are not entitled to the same\ntreatment for tracing purposes.\n                (c) Brian Is Entitled to Setoff of\n                   Certain Nonmarital Assets\n   In Brozek, we also considered whether the husband was\nentitled to a setoff for the balance of his bank accounts and\nthe value of crops he possessed on the date of the marriage.\nIn that case, the parties had been married nearly 20 years\nand the stored crops at the time of their separation, valued at\n$1.2 million, were the most substantial asset of the $2.5 mil-\nlion net marital estate. At trial, the husband estimated, through\n“an armful of exhibits,” that the premarital balance of his\naccounts was $79,000.22 Additionally, he was not able to show\nthe actual number of crop bushels he harvested the year of the\nmarriage, but, relying on the acres he farmed and the average\nyield of the area, he estimated the crop’s value at $190,000.\nHe claimed that proceeds of the premarital crop were reflected\nin the current crop, because he continually rolled his proceeds\ninto the subsequent year’s expenses.\n   We held that the husband was not entitled to a setoff from\neither source of premarital assets, because after 20 years, he\ncould “not identify the different permutations that his premari-\ntal property underwent during the marriage.”23 We reasoned\nthat his reinvestment was “mixed with the proceeds of marital\nharvests and subject to the vicissitudes of the farming economy\nfor nearly 20 years” and that he presented no evidence of\nthe unknown number of deposits and withdrawals from his\naccounts during the marriage.24\n\n22\t\n      Id. at 698, 874 N.W.2d at 31.\n23\t\n      Id. at 699, 874 N.W.2d at 31.\n24\t\n      Id. at 699, 874 N.W.2d at 32.\n\f                                  - 356 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       298 Nebraska R eports\n                       OSANTOWSKI v.

Kalkowski,25 “we decline[d] to adopt any\nbright-line rule as to whether or not crops which will eventu-\nally generate income may be treated as divisible marital prop-\nerty in a dissolution proceeding.” Our analysis considered at\nthe forefront our long-standing principle that the ultimate test\nin determining the appropriateness of the division of property\nis fairness and reasonableness as determined by the facts of\neach case.26\n   There, the parties were married for over 10 years and\nthe wife was the primary caregiver to the four marital chil-\ndren while the husband farmed. The husband argued that his\nstored and growing crops were inventory, not a traditional\nasset, because they represented income he had already earned\nbut not realized and income that he had not yet earned.\nNevertheless, he included the crops with an assigned value as\nan asset in the joint property statement and at trial, requested\nthat they be awarded to him. Therefore, we held that the court\ndid not abuse its discretion in including the crops in the mari-\ntal estate.\n   [10] Income earned from one or both spouses’ employment\nduring a marriage is a marital asset.27 However, as we recog-\nnized in Kalkowski, crops are a product of a farming operation\nthat are not income but generate income upon their liquidation.\nUnder this reasoning, crops produced before the marriage and\nsold during the marriage would generally be considered marital\nincome, but crops produced during the marriage but sold after\nwould not. Accordingly, we allow courts flexibility in their\ntreatment of stored and growing agricultural crops to account\nfor the equities of the situation.\n   In this case, Brian entered the marriage with a large amount\nof income from his liquidated crops and unrealized income in\nthe form of growing and stored crops.

On the other hand, the court chose to include the\nstored crops and proceeds from the sale of crops produced dur-\ning the marriage in the marital estate but not the crops growing\nat the time of separation, because the cultivation and risk for\nthese crops remained predominantly with Brian. This decision\nby the court fairly accounted for the realities of this situation;\nBrian should not have been punished for holding crops pro-\nduced and fully grown before the marriage.\n   The court, however, set off no value from its award of these\npremarital assets to Brian because it found that the income\nhad been commingled with marital assets. We recognize the\nlaw concerning tracing, but we also recognize the overarching\nprinciple in the division of marital property is equity, ulti-\nmately guided by fairness and reasonableness.\n   We reject Brian’s proposition that providing evidence of\nthe value of growing and stored crops on the date of marriage\nis sufficient for purposes of tracing; instead, it would simply\nbe a necessary prerequisite for the analysis. Nevertheless, we\nhold that applying the rigid requirements of tracing in this\ncase would unfairly deprive Brian of his premarital efforts\nand result in his being double charged in the division of the\nmarital estate by depriving him of his premarital assets and\nthen awarding him the real or personal property in which they\nwere invested.\n   Hershberger testified that had grain prices not been rising to\nhistoric levels, the standard practice would have been for Brian\nto liquidate his stored crops before the next harvest, which\nbegan around the time of the marriage. Further, Brian would\nlikely not have held his 2011 crops through the 2012 harvest\nwhen they were no longer traceable.\n   In Brozek, the court included in the marital estate the crops\nin storage and the balance of the husband’s bank accounts,\nwhich held the income from crop sales, on the date of the\nseparation. It also included in the marital estate the hus-\nband’s premarital crops and proceeds therefrom in his bank\n\f                              - 358 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v.

However, this case is distinguishable for a number\nof reasons.\n   First, in Brozek, the husband could not definitively identify\nthe values of his premarital assets. Just as one could not trace\nan unknown value of assets, it would be unreasonable to set off\na value of assets that is not proved. As mentioned above, Brian\nclearly established that the value of his stored and growing\ncrops was $1,021,503.07. Further, while Brian did not produce\nbank statements proving the premarital balance of his accounts,\nDori did not contest the values he provided on the second joint\nproperty statement. Accordingly, the balance of the accounts,\nas assigned by the court, was $182,471.\n   Second, the equities in Brozek were vastly different than\nin this case. In Brozek, the estimated value of the premarital\nassets was less than 10 percent of the net marital estate. Here,\nthe value of Brian’s premarital assets was nearly 87 percent of\nwhat the court stated was the net marital estate.\n   Third, the parties in Brozek had been married nearly 20\nyears. Brian and Dori’s marriage, on the other hand, lasted\nonly 31 months, spanning only 2 full crop cycles. Through\nthe course of a long-term marriage, proceeds reinvested in\ncrops are subject to the vicissitudes of the market, equipment\npurchased with such proceeds deteriorates and is replaced\nwith equipment purchased through solely marital funds, and\nthe equity of commingling funds becomes less severe. In light\nof the short-term marriage here, it would be inequitable to\nallow Dori to benefit from an increase to the marital estate\nof over $1.2 million in assets because of Brian’s inability to\ntrace them.\n   Accordingly, based on the equities of the situation in this\ncase, the court’s failure to set off the value of Brian’s premari-\ntal bank accounts and crops placed Brian at a vast disadvantage\nin the division of marital property. Therefore, fairness and\nreasonableness require a determination that the court abused\nits discretion in not setting off $1,203,974.07 from the mari-\ntal estate.\n\f                             - 359 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v.

Valuation and Distribution\n                        of M arital Assets\n\n              (a) Trial Court Abused Its Discretion\n                    by Double Counting Assets\n   Brian argues that the court double counted assets by award-\ning him check No. 1718, for $78,500, and the 2011 John Deere\ntractor model 9630T without deducting the downpayment on\nthe tractor as evidenced by check No. 1718.\n   In exhibit 20, Dori listed the checks and their values that\nshe argued were prepayments for farming expenses associ-\nated with the 2014 crop that Brian paid with marital funds\nbefore the separation. She did not claim any interest in the\n2014 crops but argued that the prepayments with marital assets\nshould be considered marital property. Included in the exhibit\n20 list was check No. 1718 for $78,500, which was dated\nFebruary 3, 2014. At trial, however, both parties testified that\ncheck No. 1718 was used as a downpayment for the 2011 John\nDeere tractor.\n   In its decree, the court awarded Brian all of the prepaid farm\nexpenses listed in exhibit 20 as marital assets, including check\nNo. 1718 with the value of $78,500. The court also awarded\nBrian the 2011 John Deere tractor model 9630T, at a value of\n$140,000, which represented its fair market value of $205,000\nminus the premarital value of a Cat Challenger tractor that was\nsold for $65,000 and used toward its purchase.\n   The court’s failure to deduct the $78,500 prepayment on\nthe 2011 John Deere tractor model 9630T from the tractor’s\nvalue resulted in an increase to Brian’s net marital estate of\n$78,500. Accordingly, the court abused its discretion in sub-\nstantially increasing the value of the marital estate it awarded\nto Brian.\n                (b) Court Abused Its Discretion\n                  by Valuing Crops in Storage\n                     as of March 20, 2014\n   Brian contends that the court erred in accepting Dori’s value\nof the stored crops that relied on his March 20, 2014, balance\n\f                                    - 360 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        298 Nebraska R eports\n                        OSANTOWSKI v.

He argues this valuation is inequitable, because it repre-\nsents the quantity of stored crops and the price per bushel on\nMarch 20, 2014, rather than the actual date of separation over 2\nmonths later. Accordingly, he argues that the quantity and value\nof crops in storage should be valued at $444,099.68, because\nthe evidence shows that he had only 95,300.36 bushels of corn\non May 31, 2014, and the price per bushel of corn on that day\nwas $4.66.\n   Dori contends that the quantity and valuation of the parties’\nstored crops is a disputed factual matter and that we should\ndefer to the trial court’s decision, because it had the opportu-\nnity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. She contends\nthat unlike Brian and his expert, Hershberger, she has consist­\nently maintained her opinion that the stored crop’s marital\nvalue was $573,750, which the court accepted.\n   [11] As a general principle, the date upon which a mari-\ntal estate is valued should be rationally related to the prop-\nerty composing the marital estate. The date of valuation is\nreviewed for an abuse of the trial court’s discretion.28\n   As discussed in the background section, the parties spent a\nconsiderable period of time at trial contesting the quantity and\nvalue of corn that the parties owned at the time of separation.\nHershberger testified that his determination in exhibit 37 of\nthe quantity of corn in storage was based on Brian’s or Brian’s\nmother’s determination as to what year of crops were reflected\nin the sales receipts in the fall of 2014. He also testified that\nif the information he was provided was inaccurate, then so\nwas exhibit 37. Exhibit 37 is the final valuation that Brian\nrelied upon and what he argues we should find the value as\non appeal.\n   Exhibit 37 shows that the bushels of corn the parties owned\non March 20, 2014, was 142,040.44. Hershberger’s report\nshowed the bushels of corn the parties owned on May 31,\n2014, was 95,300.36. The record also contains five sales\n\n28\t\n      Stanosheck v.

In addition, the record con-\ntains deposit slips showing that the proceeds from each of the\nfive sales were deposited into Brian’s farm checking account\nbetween April 8 and May 12, 2014. The value of Brian’s farm\nchecking account was determined as of May 31, 2014.\n   The court’s reliance on the corn values as of March 20,\n2014, and its reliance on the bank account balance as of\nMay 31, 2014, creates a double counting of the corn’s value.\nAccordingly, the court abused its discretion in disregarding this\nevidence and relying on the March 20, 2014, balance sheet\nalone, because it resulted in a valuation that was not rationally\nrelated to the property composing the marital estate. Therefore,\nthe value of crops in storage on the date of separation awarded\nto Brian is $444,099.68.\n\n               (c) Errors Argued But Not Assigned\n   Dori contends that on the date of separation, Brian had\n45,024.032 bushels of corn stored at Husker Coop, with a\nvalue of $209,811.93, which was not included in the court’s\naward. Her argument is based on an August 23, 2013, settle-\nment sheet from Husker Coop, which shows that Brian had\n70,024.02 bushels of corn stored there and that he sold 25,000\nbushels of the stored corn. She argues that there is no record of\nthis remaining corn being sold and that it is not accounted for\non Brian’s March 20, 2014, balance sheet.\n   Brian argues that the court incorrectly added the value of\nthe bank accounts it awarded to Dori as marital property.\nIf Brian were correct, the court’s mistake would constitute\nplain error.29 His argument, however, is more properly char-\nacterized as asserting that the court incorrectly valued the\nmarital assets in Dori’s First National Bank savings account\n\n29\t\n      See Clason v.

Therefore, we do not consider either\nparties’ argument.\n\n              3. Plain Error Committed by Court\n   [13,14] Plain error exists where there is an error, plainly\nevident from the record but not complained of at trial, which\nprejudicially affects a substantial right of a litigant and is of\nsuch a nature that to leave it uncorrected would cause a mis-\ncarriage of justice or result in damage to the integrity, reputa-\ntion, and fairness of the judicial process.31 Plain error may be\nasserted for the first time on appeal or be noted by an appellate\ncourt on its own motion.32\n\n                (a) Trial Court Erred in Valuing\n                 Marital Debt on Roberts Farm\n   In its decree, the court explained that Brian had listed\nsecured debt on the real estate, including the Bosshart/\nGruenwald farm, the Dodendorf farm, and the Roberts farm,\nin the amount of $1,063,797. As a result, the court calculated\nthe value of the secured marital debt on the Roberts farm by\ndeducting the value of Brian’s premarital debt on the Bosshart/\nGruenwald farm and the Dodendorf farm on the date of the\nmarriage from the total stated amount. After making the deduc-\ntion, it determined that the marital debt secured by real estate\nwas $894,081.\n\n30\t\n      Hike v. State, 297 Neb. 212, 899 N.W.2d 614 (2017).\n31\t\n      State v.

Accordingly, the court mistakenly valued the\nRoberts farm debt to be $22,784 more than it actually was.\n   The court’s valuation of the Roberts farm was not based on\nthe evidence and resulted in Brian’s being awarded an addi-\ntional $22,784 in marital debt. In doing so, the court committed\nplain error in this valuation.\n   Since we give Brian credit for his premarital crop inventory,\nhis argument that he used $80,000 from the premarital crops\nfor a downpayment on the Roberts farm is without merit.\n               (b) Court Failed to Set Off Brian’s\n                   Premarital Dodendorf Farm\n                    Debt From Marital Estate\n   The court awarded Brian the debt owed on the Dodendorf\nfarm as a marital debt but did not assign a value. The par-\nties agreed in both joint property statements that the value of\nthis debt at the time of separation was $17,451. Under Dori’s\nvaluation of the debt, however, she stated on both joint prop-\nerty statements that the debt was premarital, and Brian did\nthe same on the second joint property statement. This debt\nis listed in Brian’s February 18, 2010, balance sheet, and the\ncourt awarded the Dodendorf farm to Brian as a premari-\ntal asset.\n   In awarding Brian the debt on the Dodendorf farm as a\nmarital debt, it committed plain error in failing to set off the\ndebt as premarital in the amount of $17,451.\n           (c) Trial Court Failed to Value and Award\n                Certain Marital Assets and Debts\n   As mentioned above, under § 42-365, a court has a duty to\nvalue and divide all of the assets and debts constituting the\nmarital estate. In this case, the court’s failure to do so in the\nfollowing instances significantly affected the valuation and\nequitable distribution of the marital estate.\n\f                                 - 364 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       298 Nebraska R eports\n                        OSANTOWSKI v.

Brian valued these items at a combined\ntotal of $25,900, and Dori valued them at a combined total\nof $78,010. At trial, Brian testified that his valuations were\nbased on the appraisals from Grubaugh Auction Services, and\nDori testified that her valuations were based on the deprecia-\ntion schedules from Brian’s tax returns or the May 20, 2014,\nbalance sheet.\n   The court awarded Brian “[a]ny property not specifically\nlisted, but in [his] possession.” Further, the court relied on the\nGrubaugh Auction Services appraisals over Brian’s deprecia-\ntion schedule for valuing all of the items it valued. Dori did not\nassign error to the court’s reliance on those appraisals, so we\nwill defer to the court’s judgment on that issue.\n   Accordingly, we award these remaining assets to Brian\nand find their value as follows: “2012 Brandt Grain Deck,”\n$10,500; “2010 Polaris 550 ATV,” $3,500; a one-third inter-\nest in two pivots (Roberts farm), $2,000; a one-third interest\nin the Hondorfer farm well pump, $4,000; a 48-foot grain bin,\n$1,500; and a 24-foot enclosed car trailer, $4,400.\n\n33\t\n      Schuman, supra note 17.\n\f                                      - 365 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        298 Nebraska R eports\n                         OSANTOWSKI v.

It sum-\nmarized the total marital debts awarded to Brian as $1,145,294.\nWe can find no combination of debts in the record that total\nthis amount.\n   The value of the following debts awarded to Brian were\nundisputed: Roberts Farm, $871,297; “Ag Direct” loan for\nthe Cat Challenger tractor, $30,548; “John Deere Financial,”\n$183,000; and “Chase Auto Finance,” $30,785. As a result,\nwe determine the amount of debt awarded to Brian to be\n$1,115,630.\n   However, other debts were inconsistently listed on the joint\nproperty statements or the evidence varied as to the amounts\nowed, including the Great Western Bank operating line of\ncredit, a Sears credit card debt, and a Cabela’s credit card debt.\n   At trial, the president of Great Western Bank and Brian’s\nprimary lender testified that the March 20, 2014, balance\nsheet accurately stated that Brian owed $1,486 on the operat-\ning line of credit on that date but that it had no balance owed\non the date of separation. Dori did not challenge this wit-\nness’ credibility, and the court made no finding that he was\nnot credible.\n   In regard to the Sears and Cabela’s credit cards, Dori intro-\nduced evidence to show that both debts were paid in full on\nthe date of separation.\n   Brian also claimed for the first time on the second joint\nproperty statement that he had a marital debt from unpaid\nproperty taxes. Under the title of the debt, Brian listed the four\nproperties, presumably, from which the taxes were owed. One\nof these was the Roberts farm, but the others were premarital\nproperties. Real estate taxes on nonmarital property are non-\nmarital debts.34 Brian did not submit any supporting evidence\n\n34\t\n      2 Brett R.

We also conclude that Brian failed to submit sufficient\nevidence to show how much, if any, unpaid taxes he owed on\nthe Roberts farm; accordingly, the court did not err in failing\nto assign it.\n             (iii) Brian Should Have Been Awarded\n                    Value of Reduction in His\n                    Premarital Debts as Asset\n   [15] “[A] non-owning spouse is entitled to some ben-\nefit when marital funds have been expended to improve or\nreduce the debt on the other spouse’s nonmarital property.”35\nAs discussed above, Brian had $918,775.69 in premarital\ndebts between loans on his nonmarital property and expenses\nincurred in the production of his 2011 crop. According to\nBrian’s premarital debts listed on the March 20, 2014, bal-\nance sheet, only $209,951 of these debts existed on the date of\nseparation. As a result, Brian’s premarital debts were reduced,\nduring the marriage, by approximately $708,824.69. In light\nof the fact that we set off the premarital value of Brian’s bank\naccounts and stored and growing crop inventory, it would be\ninequitable to not also include in the marital estate this benefit\nconferred to Brian. Accordingly, we award Brian the value of\nhis premarital debts reduced with marital funds.\n                 4.

Additionally, Brian argues that we\nshould award Dori less than the standard 33 to 50 percent of\nthe marital estate, under Davidson v. Davidson.36 He argues\nthis case is factually analogous to Davidson, except the wife\nin Davidson abandoned a promising career for the marriage,\n\n36\t\n      Davidson, supra note 27.\n\f                                    - 368 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       298 Nebraska R eports\n                        OSANTOWSKI v.

Further, he asserts\nthat the division does not provide him a means to pay the\naward, because it will likely put him out of business.\n   Dori contends that the court’s distribution was warranted\nbecause both parties worked hard during the marriage and she\nchanged her field of study and college for her doctoral program\nto benefit the marriage. She argues that the unique circum-\nstances in Davidson are not applicable here, because Brian had\nbeen farming only a short time before the marriage and held no\nstock options or retention shares. Further, she asserts that there\nis no evidence to support Brian’s claim that he cannot make\nthe equalization payment, because at the time of separation, he\nhad little short-term debt and significant liquid assets and had\nprepaid many of his 2014 farm expenses.\n   [16-18] In dividing property and considering alimony upon\na dissolution of marriage, a court should consider four fac-\ntors: (1) the circumstances of the parties, (2) the duration of\nthe marriage, (3) the history of contributions to the marriage,\nand (4) the ability of the supported party to engage in gain-\nful employment.37 In addition to the specific criteria listed in\n§ 42-365, in dividing property and considering alimony upon\na dissolution of marriage, a court should consider the income\nand earning capacity of each party and the general equities of\nthe situation.38 As a general rule, a spouse should be awarded\none-third to one-half of the marital estate, the polestar being\nfairness and reasonableness as determined by the facts of\neach case.39\n   In Davidson, the marital estate was valued at $7,886,119, of\nwhich the husband’s employee stock options and stock reten-\ntion shares alone accounted for $5,655,974.40 At the time of the\n\n37\t\n      Anderson v.

About 1 year into the marriage, he was named\npresident of the Union Pacific Corporation, and about 2 years\ninto the marriage, he was promoted to chief operating officer\nof that same corporation. We acknowledged that the bulk of the\nmarital estate consisted of stock options and retention shares\nthat were earned as a result of those promotions.\n   In considering the equitable division of the estate, we noted\nthat the husband’s “33-year career in the railroad industry had\nreached its zenith at the time the parties were married” and\nthat he had been receiving stock options and retention annu-\nally for the 10 years preceding the marriage.41 We also noted\nthat the wife provided social support, tutored the husband’s\ncollege-age son, and interrupted a successful career for the\nmarriage. On the other hand, the husband’s nonmarital chil-\ndren did not reside permanently with the parties and the wife\nwas able to finish her Ph.D. during the marriage. Further,\nwe reasoned:\n         Considering that no children were born to the parties,\n      that the parties separated after 2 years, that the marriage\n      lasted 38 months, that [the husband’s] career was well\n      established, and that [the wife] is highly educated and\n      capable of finding employment, we conclude that the trial\n      court’s adherence to the general guidelines was an abuse\n      of discretion.42\nAccordingly, based on the circumstances of the case, which\nwe stated were “unique,” we reversed the court’s order grant-\ning the wife 33 percent of the marital estate and held that the\nwife was entitled to only $950,000, or about 12 percent of the\nmarital estate.43\n   In the instant case, we reject Brian’s argument that the\ncircumstances warrant deviating from our general rule for\n\n41\t\n      Id. at 670, 578 N.W.2d at 859.\n42\t\n      Id. at 671, 578 N.W.2d at 859.\n43\t\n      Id. at 672, 578 N.W.2d at 860.\n\f                             - 370 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                  OSANTOWSKI v.

While some of the factors for\ndividing the marital estate in this case are similar to those in\nDavidson, the unique circumstances in Davidson that war-\nranted the deviation is not.\n   The facts in Davidson were unique because the husband’s\ncareer reached its zenith at the same time that the parties mar-\nried. As a result of the husband’s career-long efforts, he was\ntwice promoted during the short-term marriage, which resulted\nin his receiving employee stock options and stock retention\nshares far in excess of his regular salary. While we accounted\nfor the portion of the option and shares that were nonmari-\ntal, the remaining value had still resulted substantially from\nhis premarital efforts and the husband had no ability to pre-\nvent these assets from becoming marital as they were income\nfrom employment.\n   Because we decided that Brian was entitled to a setoff of\nhis premarital assets above, there is nothing in this case that\napproaches the inequity we found in Davidson.\n   Admittedly, the following factors in this case are similar\nto those in Davidson: the marriage was short term, no chil-\ndren were born of the marriage, Brian contributed a dispro-\nportionate amount of finances to the estate, Dori received a\nprofessional doctoral degree during the marriage, and both\nparties are well situated to engage in gainful employment.\nAlso, unlike in Davidson, Dori did not forgo any employment\nopportunities, and, while she changed her educational plans,\nDori received a comparable education to what she would have\nin South Dakota.\n   While these factors may support awarding Dori only 33 per-\ncent of the marital estate, as the lower court in Davidson had,\nthe circumstances of the parties and their contributions to the\nmarriage support a more equal distribution.\n   In Davidson, the wife made little contribution to the mar-\nriage, financially or through other efforts, which we described\nas occasional tutoring of the husband’s son and volunteer work.\n   Here, Dori worked full time during her breaks from school\nand after graduation, and she received financial support from\n\f                             - 371 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v.

While she earned less than\nBrian, she bore most of the costs of the apartment in Lincoln,\nher living expenses in Lincoln, and her travel expenses. Brian,\non the other hand, lived in a house provided by his parents\nand provided no evidence of expenses outside of his farming\noperation. Brian provided little financial support to Dori dur-\ning the marriage, which prevented her from accruing savings\nor other assets.\n   Further, while her education was comparable to what she\nwould have received, she changed her field of study to enable\nher to contribute to the farming operation. While her contribu-\ntions to the farming operation during the marriage were mini-\nmal, what she did contribute was based primarily on knowl-\nedge she obtained from her studies, which showed the utility of\nthe educational decisions she made.\n   Additionally, Dori bore the majority of the burden of travel\nduring the marriage to allow the parties to see each other.\nDuring the portion of the marriage when Dori resided in\nLincoln, she still traveled to the Polk County residence 3 or\n4 days a week. During the other portion of the marriage when\nDori resided in Polk County, she commuted to Lincoln for\nschool and her full-time summer employment. Brian traveled\nto Lincoln frequently during the first winter of the marriage\nbut carried little of the burden thereafter. Further, Dori was\nsolely responsible for maintaining her Lincoln residence and\nalso put in considerable efforts at the Polk County residence.\nBrian testified that she would provide extra assistance at the\nPolk County residence during his busy season, which allowed\nhim to focus on his farming operation.\n   While reasonable minds could differ as to what the appropri-\nate distribution of the marital estate within the general range\nshould have been in this case, an abuse of discretion is a highly\ndeferential standard of review. Our opinion, based on an inde-\npendent review of the record, supplants the court’s decision\nonly in the instance where its decision was untenable. Brian\ncontributed more financially to the marital estate, but Dori also\nearned income throughout the marriage and was responsible\n\f                             - 372 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v.

She also bore a disproportionate\namount of homemaking duties and the burden to ensure she\nand Brian could spend time together regularly during the mar-\nriage. Finally, as the trial court reasoned, Brian had the oppor-\ntunity to keep his family gifts and nonmarital property con-\ntributions, which contributed heavily to his earnings, separate\nfrom the estate, but did not. Accordingly, we cannot say that\nthe decision by the district court was unreasonable or unfair.\n   Brian presented no evidence to support his claim that the\nequalization payment would threaten the continuation of his\nbusiness. He was awarded substantial cash assets, prepaid\nfarming expenses for 2014, and the crops produced that year,\nthe expenses of which would likely have been paid in the prior\nyear when they were produced. Accordingly, we find no merit\nto his claim that requiring him to make an equalization pay-\nment was unfair.\n                       V. CONCLUSION\n   We affirm the court’s decision that stored and growing\ncrops should not be treated the same as cattle herds for trac-\ning purposes, but we hold that the court committed an abuse\nof discretion and plain error in its distribution of nonmarital\nand marital assets and debts. Notably, based on the circum-\nstances of this case, we find that the court erred in not setting\noff the value of Brian’s stored and growing crops on the date\nof marriage and not assigning a credit to the marital estate for\nthe substantial amount of Brian’s premarital debts that were\nreduced during the marriage.\n   Further, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion\nin awarding Dori one-half of the marital estate. In light of our\nholdings above, we modify the court’s order consistent with\nthis opinion and order Brian to make an equalization payment\nof $260,761.15.\n                                         A ffirmed as modified.\n   Wright, J., not participating in the decision.\n\f",

In a marital dissolution\n                     action, an appellate court reviews the case de novo on the record to\n                     determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion by the trial\n                     judge. This standard of review applies to the trial court’s determinations\n                     regarding custody, child support, division of property, alimony, and\n                     attorney fees.\n                2.\t Evidence: Appeal and Error. In a review de novo on the record, an\n                     appellate court is required to make independent factual determina-\n                     tions based upon the record, and the court reaches its own independent\n                     conclusions with respect to the matters at issue. When evidence is in\n                     conflict, the appellate court considers and may give weight to the fact\n                     that the trial court heard and observed the witnesses and accepted one\n                     version of the facts rather than another.\n                3.\t Judges: Words and Phrases. A judicial abuse of discretion exists if the\n                     reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriv-\n                     ing a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in matters\n                     submitted for disposition.\n                4.\t Judgments: Appeal and Error.

The third step is to calculate and divide the net marital\n      estate between the parties in accordance with the principles contained in\n      § 42-365.\n  7.\t ____: ____. Generally, all property accumulated and acquired by either\n      spouse during a marriage is part of the marital estate.

Agricultural crops are categorically dif-\n      ferent in nature from a herd of cattle and, therefore, are not entitled to\n      the same treatment for tracing purposes.\n10.\t Agriculture: Crops: Equity. Courts are allowed flexibility in their\n      treatment of stored and growing agricultural crops to account for the\n      equities of the situation.\n11.\t Property Division: Appeal and Error. As a general principle, the date\n      upon which a marital estate is valued should be rationally related to the\n      property composing the marital estate. The date of valuation is reviewed\n      for an abuse of the trial court’s discretion.\n12.\t Appeal and Error. Absent plain error, errors argued but not assigned\n      will not be considered on appeal.\n13.\t Appeal and Error: Words and Phrases. Plain error exists where there\n      is an error, plainly evident from the record but not complained of at\n      trial, which prejudicially affects a substantial right of a litigant and is of\n      such a nature that to leave it uncorrected would cause a miscarriage of\n      justice or result in damage to the integrity, reputation, and fairness of the\n      judicial process.\n14.\t Appeal and Error. Plain error may be asserted for the first time on\n      appeal or be noted by an appellate court on its own motion.\n15.\t Property Division. A nonowning spouse is entitled to some benefit\n      when marital funds have been expended to improve or reduce the debt\n      on the other spouse’s nonmarital property.\n16.\t Divorce: Property Division: Alimony. In dividing property and consid-\n      ering alimony upon a dissolution of marriage, a court should consider\n      four factors: (1) the circumstances of the parties, (2) the duration of the\n      marriage, (3) the history of contributions to the marriage, and (4) the\n      ability of the supported party to engage in gainful employment.\n17.\t ____: ____: ____.

Parties’ M arriage\n   During the marriage, Brian resided primarily in Polk County,\nNebraska, at a residence owned by his parents. Dori main-\ntained a residence in Lincoln, Nebraska, until May 2013. Dori\ntestified that while she was living in Lincoln, she spent a\nminimum of three to four nights per week with Brian in Polk\nCounty during the academic year and full time during the sum-\nmers and other school breaks. As of May 2013, Dori resided in\nPolk County full time and commuted to Lincoln for her final\nsemester of school.\n   In September 2013, Dori held a master’s degree in ento-\nmology from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and\nwas enrolled in a doctoral program for plant health at UNL.\nShe testified that while she had originally intended to pur-\nsue a Ph.D. in entomology at South Dakota State University,\nshe enrolled in a program at UNL instead because Brian had\nobjected to the distance. Dori also stated that she changed\nher program to plant health so that she could gain a better\nunderstanding of agriculture in Nebraska and contribute to the\nOsantowski farming operation.\n   Dori received a scholarship and a stipend for her school and\nliving expenses. She also worked full time during the summers\nin Lincoln, earning between $8,000 and $20,000 in wages for\n2011, 2012, and 2013 each. Most of Dori’s income and schol-\narship money during the marriage went to tuition, insurance\npayments, payments for her motorcycle, commuting expenses,\nrent and utilities for the Lincoln apartment, and other living\nexpenses. She testified that Brian provided minimal financial\nsupport to her during the marriage, but what he did provide\nwas used for the household expenses she paid for the Polk\nCounty residence. In February 2014, Dori began working full\ntime for an annual salary of $75,000 and obtained medical and\ndental insurance for herself and Brian.\n\f                              - 343 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v.

Under the\noperation, Brian and his brothers own equipment separately\nbut jointly acquire land, which is owned in equal thirds.\nEach brother, however, farms land independently and bears\nthe rental fees and input costs for his operation. Accordingly,\ncrops and expenses are completely separate and distinct to\neach individual.\n   Brian testified that he receives benefits from his family\nwhich increase the profitability of his farming operation,\nincluding: discounted rental rates of $150 to $200 per acre ver-\nsus the market rate of $300 to $400 per acre on the majority of\nthe land that he rents; the majority of his diesel fuel at no cost\nto him; and the sharing of equipment, labor, shop space, and\nvarious other expenses.\n   Dori testified that she made the following contributions\nto Brian’s farming operation: Brian would consult her about\nchemical and herbicide application and general soil welfare;\nshe created plat maps for all of the Osantowski fields to keep\nfield spray records and to help plan for the future; she scouted\nfields for weed growth; she picked up parts and ran errands;\nand she went with Brian to check fields, pivots, and lay irri-\ngation pipe. Brian agreed that Dori performed these tasks\noccasionally, except he explained that the plat maps created\nby Dori were part of her summer employment and that when\nDori would ride with him to the fields, she did so because she\nenjoyed riding a “four-wheeler” and not because she actually\nhelped with irrigation.\n   Dori also testified that she performed all of the household\nduties at her Lincoln residence and that such duties in the Polk\nCounty residence were a team effort with Brian.\n                2. Evidence Offered at Trial\n  The parties offered into evidence two versions of a joint\nproperty statement, each listing premarital and marital debts\nand assets.

Additional documents were received into\nevidence to support the property statements, including per-\nsonal property appraisals from Grubaugh Auction Services,\nLLC; inventory reports from a certified public accountant;\ntax returns; settlement sheets from elevators; bank statements;\nretirement accounts; and balance sheets from several banks,\nincluding Great Western Bank.\n                 (a) Stored and Growing Crops\n   In regard to the premarital and marital crop inventory, Brian\ncalled Michael Hershberger as his expert witness to determine\nthe quantity of stored crops that Brian had on the date of mar-\nriage and on the date of separation. Hershberger is a certified\npublic accountant who works with agricultural clients on a\nregular basis. In reaching his conclusions on these issues,\nHershberger relied on Brian’s tax returns from 2011 to 2014;\nthe total annual yields in Brian’s crop insurance reports, which\nwere reported to him by Brian; two crop sales receipts; and\na spreadsheet summary of Brian’s recorded crop sales. The\nspreadsheet summary was prepared by Brian’s mother, who\ndoes all of Brian’s bookkeeping.\n   On the first day of trial, Hershberger gave testimony regard-\ning his determination of crop inventories and a report he\nauthored was received into evidence. However, that testi-\nmony and the exhibit were stricken from the record, because\nHershberger had relied on grain elevator receipts which were\nnot provided to Dori through discovery. After Brian supple-\nmented his discovery, Hershberger was again called to testify\nregarding the crop inventory.\n   In regard to the premarital crop inventory, Hershberger\nopined that Brian had a total of 57,156.26 bushels of corn\nin storage on September 23, 2011, and 91,296.09 bushels\nof corn and 10,405.99 bushels of soybeans ready for har-\nvest. On September 23, the price at the local elevator was\n$6.07 for a bushel of corn and $11.57 for a bushel of soy-\nbeans. Accordingly, Hershberger concluded that the fair market\n\f                             - 345 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                  OSANTOWSKI v.

Accordingly, he valued the corn in storage\non the date of separation as $444,099.68.\n   However, a balance sheet Brian had submitted to Great\nWestern Bank, dated March 20, 2014, stated that he had\n135,000 bushels of corn on hand which had a value of\n$573,750. Additionally, in Brian’s November 2014 response\nto Dori’s interrogatories, he stated that the March 20 balance\nsheet reflected the quantity and value of the stored crops. In\nboth joint property statements, Dori relied on the March 20\nbalance sheet for the quantity and value of crops that were\nmarital property.\n   In the May 2015 joint property statement, Brian failed to\nlist the quantity of crops in storage or assign a value thereto.\nBut in the January 2016 joint property statement, Brian listed\n14,862 bushels of corn in storage on the date of separation\nwith a value of $69,257. At trial, Brian testified that his\nJanuary 2016 estimation of the quantity of corn in storage\non the date of separation was based on Hershberger’s ini-\ntial analysis.\n   Hershberger admitted, however, that his opinions changed\ndramatically from the first day of trial to the second day of\ntrial. His valuation of the stored crops on the date of sepa-\nration changed from $69,259.25 to $444,099.68.

Hershberger\nattributed these changes to his mistaken belief that all crops\nwere sold before the next harvest began. But after he requested\nthat Brian’s mother identify the year of production for each\ncrop at issue in the sale transactions on the spreadsheet sum-\nmary, his analysis changed.\n\n                   (b) Personal Property and\n                        Farm Equipment\n   Minimal testimony was elicited regarding the parties’ pre-\nmarital and marital personal property and farm equipment. The\njoint property statements set forth the items, and Brian and\nDori generally agreed to them. The values, however, were not\nagreed upon by the parties. A personal property and equipment\nappraisal was completed by Grubaugh Auction Services and\nwas received into evidence. The court generally adopted the\nvaluations established in that report.\n\n                         (c) Real Estate\n   In regard to real estate, the record shows that Brian owned\nfour parcels of real estate prior to the marriage as follows: a\none-third interest in the “NW1⁄4 [of] Section 8, Township 15\nNorth, Range 1 West[,] Butler County[, Nebraska]” (Bosshart/\nGruenwald farm); a one-third interest in the “SW1⁄4W1⁄2NW1⁄4\n[of] Section 4, Township 15 North, Range 1, Butler County”\n(Hondorfer farm); a one-third interest in the “W1⁄2NE1⁄4 [of]\nSection 8, Township 16 North[, Butler County]” (Dodendorf\nfarm); and a one-third interest in the “E1⁄2SE1⁄4 [of] Section\n13, Township 16 North, Range 1, Polk County” (Jahn farm).\nDuring the marriage, the parties purchased a one-third inter-\nest in the “SW1⁄4 of Section 10, Township 15 North, Range 2\nWest and the NW1⁄4 of Section 15, Township 15 North, Range\n2 West, Polk County” (Roberts farm).

However,\nBrian annually submitted balance sheets to Great Western Bank\nthat listed his debts and their value on the date of submission.\nThe balance sheets nearest to the date of marriage were dated\nDecember 8, 2010, and March 8, 2012. The parties relied on\nthe debts listed on the March 2012 balance sheet in their joint\nproperty statements, and the court awarded Brian the six debts\nlisted therein as premarital. The court, however, did not include\ncorresponding values to these debts.\n   Though the parties listed different amounts for certain debts,\nthe record indicates that the value of the premarital debts\nawarded to Brian are as follows: Great Western Bank 2010\noperating line of credit, $162,000; Great Western Bank loan\nfor a 2008 Mercury Milan, $6,927; Bosshart/Gruenwald farm\nsecured debt, $125,495; Dodendorf farm secured debt, $31,557;\n“Ag Direct” loan for a Cat Challenger tractor, $49,250; and\nHondorfer farm secured debt (Great Western Bank account No.\nxxx6688), $247,500. The six debts totaled $622,729.\n   Additionally, the record contains a 2011 “itemized catego-\nries report.” This report shows that Brian paid $296,046.69\nin expenses after the date of the marriage. Brian testified at\ntrial that each of these expenses were incurred for his 2011\ncrop, which he claimed as a premarital asset, and the court\nawarded him as such. Accordingly, these expenses were pre-\nmarital debts.\n   Therefore, Brian’s total premarital debts, as reflected in the\nrecord, were approximately $918,775.69.\n   Dori had a $7,000 debt to her father on the date of the mar-\nriage, and she was awarded this premarital debt by the court.\nThe court did not assign a value to this debt, but on the joint\nproperty statements, Dori listed its value at $7,000.

Trial Court’s Decree\n   In June 2016, the court issued its decree dissolving the par-\nties’ marriage and ordering the division of the marital estate.\nThe court determined values for most of the premarital and\nmarital assets it awarded.\n   The court awarded premarital assets to Dori, with a total\nvalue of $20,600, and to Brian, with a total value of $1,139,047.\nTwo of the premarital assets awarded to Brian were the value\nof his 2010 crops, sold in 2011, and his 2011 crops, sold in\n2012, but the court did not assign a value to these assets. It also\nawarded him the funds present on the date of the marriage in\nfour separate bank accounts.\n   However, the court found that all of Brian’s premarital crops\nhad been liquidated by the date of separation. It also found that\nBrian deposited the nonmarital proceeds from the liquidated\ncrops into his premarital bank accounts, along with the pro-\nceeds from the sale of the marital crops. Accordingly, the court\nfound that these premarital crops and monetary assets were\ncommingled with marital assets. Therefore, it ruled that Brian\nwas not entitled to a setoff from the marital estate for these\npremarital assets.\n   The court also rejected Brian’s argument that crops should\nbe treated similarly to a herd of cattle—as a single asset for\ntracing purposes. It reasoned that a herd of cattle is similar\nto land in that it is a self-sustaining and income producing.\nConversely, it stated that crops are an end product that is mar-\nketed and liquidated on a short-term basis to pay the expenses\nof producing it, purchase the seed used for the next crop’s\nproduction, purchase equipment, and provide the farmer his\nincome for the year. Accordingly, the court did not give Brian a\ncredit for any of the crops in storage on the date of separation;\ninstead, the court awarded Brian all of the crops in storage on\nthe date of separation at a value of $573,750.\n   The court listed the marital debt it awarded to Dori with a\ncorresponding value of $3,216.

It reasoned that any\nfinancial benefit Brian brought to the relationship, above his\nincome, was as the landlord of the premarital property he\nfarmed and that the proper way to account for such a benefit\nwould have been to charge the marriage a cash rent or a crop-\nshare arrangement and segregate it as nonmarital property, of\nwhich Brian did not do or provide evidence.\n   The court ordered Brian to make an equalization payment of\n$680,000 to Dori, awarding about half of the marital estate to\neach party.\n   The court overruled Brian’s subsequent motion for new trial\nor to alter and amend the judgment. Brian appealed.\n\n                II.

However, it failed\nto include any credits for that amount. The court awarded\nBrian the 2010 and 2011 crops, but it did not determine a\nvalue for those crops. Brian claims that he used $80,000 from\nthe premarital crops for a downpayment on real estate pur-\nchased during the marriage, but that the court did not give him\ncredit for the $80,000.\n   Brian further contends that based on his testimony and\nthat of Hershberger, he had met his burden to trace the value\nof his crops on the date of marriage. In the alternative, he\nasserts that we should treat crops as a single unit for tracing\npurposes, as the Nebraska Court of Appeals did with live-\nstock in Shafer v. Shafer.15 He asserts that both livestock and\ncrops are biological commodities that are sustained through\nthe reinvestment of the proceeds from their sales and that\ncrops are not self-sustaining merely as a result of the propri-\netary nature of seeds which producers are contractually obli-\ngated to not replant. Accordingly, he asserts that we should\ndeduct the crops he had on the date of marriage from the\ncrops in storage on the date of separation and set it off from\nthe marital estate. Additionally, he argues that the $80,000\ndownpayment he made on the Roberts farm was traceable to\npremarital funds.\n   Dori contends that under our decision in Brozek v. Brozek,16\nthe court correctly found that Brian was not entitled to a setoff\nof his premarital crops or the proceeds from those crops and\nthe premarital funds in his accounts because they no longer\nexisted or had been commingled with marital assets at the\ntime of separation.

While Dori vigorously contested Brian’s credibil-\nity and Hershberger’s reliability, she presented no alterna-\ntive estimations. Further, Hershberger’s estimation of Brian’s\nstored crops and growing crops in 2011 was supported by\nthe crop insurance reports, tax returns, balance sheets, and\nsales receipts in the record. Exhibit 37 stated the value of\nBrian’s stored and growing crops on the date of marriage was\n$1,021,503.07.\n   [8] Appeals in domestic relations matters are heard de novo\non the record, and thus, an appellate court is empowered to\nenter the order which should have been made as reflected by\nthe record.17 Because the record shows the appropriate non-\nmarital value of these assets, we assign $1,021,503.07 as the\nvalue of Brian’s premarital stored and growing crops.\n                  (b) Crops Are Not Similar to\n                      Livestock for Tracing\n   In Sellers v.

As we stated in Brozek, a herd of cattle is generally\nself-sustaining, through reproduction and reinvestment, and is\nnot subject to depreciation, because it consistently maintains\nits number- and income-producing capabilities. Crops, on the\nother hand, are more similar to milk products produced by\na herd of dairy cattle. Both are short-term assets that are the\nproduct of investing input, maintenance, and equipment costs.\nThey are liquidated on a short-term basis and continuously\nrolled into production. While a crop cycle is longer and crops\nmay be stored for several years, crops, like milk products, are\nstill end products that account for the income of the individuals\nraising them.\n   [9] Brian’s argument that crops would be self-sustaining\nabsent contractual requirements to not replant is unavailing.\nEven if a crop could be used as a source of seed for replanting,\n\n19\t\n      Id. at 354, 882 N.W.2d at 711, quoting Shafer, supra note 15.\n20\t\n      Id. at 355, 882 N.W.2d at 712, quoting Shafer, supra note 15.\n21\t\n      Brozek, supra note 16.\n\f                                      - 355 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        298 Nebraska R eports\n                         OSANTOWSKI v.

At trial, the husband estimated, through\n“an armful of exhibits,” that the premarital balance of his\naccounts was $79,000.22 Additionally, he was not able to show\nthe actual number of crop bushels he harvested the year of the\nmarriage, but, relying on the acres he farmed and the average\nyield of the area, he estimated the crop’s value at $190,000.\nHe claimed that proceeds of the premarital crop were reflected\nin the current crop, because he continually rolled his proceeds\ninto the subsequent year’s expenses.\n   We held that the husband was not entitled to a setoff from\neither source of premarital assets, because after 20 years, he\ncould “not identify the different permutations that his premari-\ntal property underwent during the marriage.”23 We reasoned\nthat his reinvestment was “mixed with the proceeds of marital\nharvests and subject to the vicissitudes of the farming economy\nfor nearly 20 years” and that he presented no evidence of\nthe unknown number of deposits and withdrawals from his\naccounts during the marriage.24\n\n22\t\n      Id. at 698, 874 N.W.2d at 31.\n23\t\n      Id. at 699, 874 N.W.2d at 31.\n24\t\n      Id. at 699, 874 N.W.2d at 32.\n\f                                  - 356 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       298 Nebraska R eports\n                       OSANTOWSKI v.

The husband argued that his\nstored and growing crops were inventory, not a traditional\nasset, because they represented income he had already earned\nbut not realized and income that he had not yet earned.\nNevertheless, he included the crops with an assigned value as\nan asset in the joint property statement and at trial, requested\nthat they be awarded to him.

On the other hand, the court chose to include the\nstored crops and proceeds from the sale of crops produced dur-\ning the marriage in the marital estate but not the crops growing\nat the time of separation, because the cultivation and risk for\nthese crops remained predominantly with Brian. This decision\nby the court fairly accounted for the realities of this situation;\nBrian should not have been punished for holding crops pro-\nduced and fully grown before the marriage.\n   The court, however, set off no value from its award of these\npremarital assets to Brian because it found that the income\nhad been commingled with marital assets. We recognize the\nlaw concerning tracing, but we also recognize the overarching\nprinciple in the division of marital property is equity, ulti-\nmately guided by fairness and reasonableness.\n   We reject Brian’s proposition that providing evidence of\nthe value of growing and stored crops on the date of marriage\nis sufficient for purposes of tracing; instead, it would simply\nbe a necessary prerequisite for the analysis. Nevertheless, we\nhold that applying the rigid requirements of tracing in this\ncase would unfairly deprive Brian of his premarital efforts\nand result in his being double charged in the division of the\nmarital estate by depriving him of his premarital assets and\nthen awarding him the real or personal property in which they\nwere invested.\n   Hershberger testified that had grain prices not been rising to\nhistoric levels, the standard practice would have been for Brian\nto liquidate his stored crops before the next harvest, which\nbegan around the time of the marriage. Further, Brian would\nlikely not have held his 2011 crops through the 2012 harvest\nwhen they were no longer traceable.\n   In Brozek, the court included in the marital estate the crops\nin storage and the balance of the husband’s bank accounts,\nwhich held the income from crop sales, on the date of the\nseparation. It also included in the marital estate the hus-\nband’s premarital crops and proceeds therefrom in his bank\n\f                              - 358 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v.

However, this case is distinguishable for a number\nof reasons.\n   First, in Brozek, the husband could not definitively identify\nthe values of his premarital assets. Just as one could not trace\nan unknown value of assets, it would be unreasonable to set off\na value of assets that is not proved. As mentioned above, Brian\nclearly established that the value of his stored and growing\ncrops was $1,021,503.07. Further, while Brian did not produce\nbank statements proving the premarital balance of his accounts,\nDori did not contest the values he provided on the second joint\nproperty statement. Accordingly, the balance of the accounts,\nas assigned by the court, was $182,471.\n   Second, the equities in Brozek were vastly different than\nin this case. In Brozek, the estimated value of the premarital\nassets was less than 10 percent of the net marital estate. Here,\nthe value of Brian’s premarital assets was nearly 87 percent of\nwhat the court stated was the net marital estate.\n   Third, the parties in Brozek had been married nearly 20\nyears. Brian and Dori’s marriage, on the other hand, lasted\nonly 31 months, spanning only 2 full crop cycles. Through\nthe course of a long-term marriage, proceeds reinvested in\ncrops are subject to the vicissitudes of the market, equipment\npurchased with such proceeds deteriorates and is replaced\nwith equipment purchased through solely marital funds, and\nthe equity of commingling funds becomes less severe. In light\nof the short-term marriage here, it would be inequitable to\nallow Dori to benefit from an increase to the marital estate\nof over $1.2 million in assets because of Brian’s inability to\ntrace them.\n   Accordingly, based on the equities of the situation in this\ncase, the court’s failure to set off the value of Brian’s premari-\ntal bank accounts and crops placed Brian at a vast disadvantage\nin the division of marital property. Therefore, fairness and\nreasonableness require a determination that the court abused\nits discretion in not setting off $1,203,974.07 from the mari-\ntal estate.\n\f                             - 359 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v.

Included in the exhibit\n20 list was check No. 1718 for $78,500, which was dated\nFebruary 3, 2014. At trial, however, both parties testified that\ncheck No. 1718 was used as a downpayment for the 2011 John\nDeere tractor.\n   In its decree, the court awarded Brian all of the prepaid farm\nexpenses listed in exhibit 20 as marital assets, including check\nNo. 1718 with the value of $78,500. The court also awarded\nBrian the 2011 John Deere tractor model 9630T, at a value of\n$140,000, which represented its fair market value of $205,000\nminus the premarital value of a Cat Challenger tractor that was\nsold for $65,000 and used toward its purchase.\n   The court’s failure to deduct the $78,500 prepayment on\nthe 2011 John Deere tractor model 9630T from the tractor’s\nvalue resulted in an increase to Brian’s net marital estate of\n$78,500.

Accordingly, he argues that the quantity and value\nof crops in storage should be valued at $444,099.68, because\nthe evidence shows that he had only 95,300.36 bushels of corn\non May 31, 2014, and the price per bushel of corn on that day\nwas $4.66.\n   Dori contends that the quantity and valuation of the parties’\nstored crops is a disputed factual matter and that we should\ndefer to the trial court’s decision, because it had the opportu-\nnity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. She contends\nthat unlike Brian and his expert, Hershberger, she has consist­\nently maintained her opinion that the stored crop’s marital\nvalue was $573,750, which the court accepted.\n   [11] As a general principle, the date upon which a mari-\ntal estate is valued should be rationally related to the prop-\nerty composing the marital estate.

Her argument is based on an August 23, 2013, settle-\nment sheet from Husker Coop, which shows that Brian had\n70,024.02 bushels of corn stored there and that he sold 25,000\nbushels of the stored corn. She argues that there is no record of\nthis remaining corn being sold and that it is not accounted for\non Brian’s March 20, 2014, balance sheet.\n   Brian argues that the court incorrectly added the value of\nthe bank accounts it awarded to Dori as marital property.\nIf Brian were correct, the court’s mistake would constitute\nplain error.29 His argument, however, is more properly char-\nacterized as asserting that the court incorrectly valued the\nmarital assets in Dori’s First National Bank savings account\n\n29\t\n      See Clason v.

Accordingly, the court mistakenly valued the\nRoberts farm debt to be $22,784 more than it actually was.\n   The court’s valuation of the Roberts farm was not based on\nthe evidence and resulted in Brian’s being awarded an addi-\ntional $22,784 in marital debt. In doing so, the court committed\nplain error in this valuation.\n   Since we give Brian credit for his premarital crop inventory,\nhis argument that he used $80,000 from the premarital crops\nfor a downpayment on the Roberts farm is without merit.\n               (b) Court Failed to Set Off Brian’s\n                   Premarital Dodendorf Farm\n                    Debt From Marital Estate\n   The court awarded Brian the debt owed on the Dodendorf\nfarm as a marital debt but did not assign a value. The par-\nties agreed in both joint property statements that the value of\nthis debt at the time of separation was $17,451. Under Dori’s\nvaluation of the debt, however, she stated on both joint prop-\nerty statements that the debt was premarital, and Brian did\nthe same on the second joint property statement. This debt\nis listed in Brian’s February 18, 2010, balance sheet, and the\ncourt awarded the Dodendorf farm to Brian as a premari-\ntal asset.\n   In awarding Brian the debt on the Dodendorf farm as a\nmarital debt, it committed plain error in failing to set off the\ndebt as premarital in the amount of $17,451.\n           (c) Trial Court Failed to Value and Award\n                Certain Marital Assets and Debts\n   As mentioned above, under § 42-365, a court has a duty to\nvalue and divide all of the assets and debts constituting the\nmarital estate.

Brian valued these items at a combined\ntotal of $25,900, and Dori valued them at a combined total\nof $78,010. At trial, Brian testified that his valuations were\nbased on the appraisals from Grubaugh Auction Services, and\nDori testified that her valuations were based on the deprecia-\ntion schedules from Brian’s tax returns or the May 20, 2014,\nbalance sheet.\n   The court awarded Brian “[a]ny property not specifically\nlisted, but in [his] possession.” Further, the court relied on the\nGrubaugh Auction Services appraisals over Brian’s deprecia-\ntion schedule for valuing all of the items it valued. Dori did not\nassign error to the court’s reliance on those appraisals, so we\nwill defer to the court’s judgment on that issue.\n   Accordingly, we award these remaining assets to Brian\nand find their value as follows: “2012 Brandt Grain Deck,”\n$10,500; “2010 Polaris 550 ATV,” $3,500; a one-third inter-\nest in two pivots (Roberts farm), $2,000; a one-third interest\nin the Hondorfer farm well pump, $4,000; a 48-foot grain bin,\n$1,500; and a 24-foot enclosed car trailer, $4,400.\n\n33\t\n      Schuman, supra note 17.\n\f                                      - 365 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        298 Nebraska R eports\n                         OSANTOWSKI v.

It sum-\nmarized the total marital debts awarded to Brian as $1,145,294.\nWe can find no combination of debts in the record that total\nthis amount.\n   The value of the following debts awarded to Brian were\nundisputed: Roberts Farm, $871,297; “Ag Direct” loan for\nthe Cat Challenger tractor, $30,548; “John Deere Financial,”\n$183,000; and “Chase Auto Finance,” $30,785. As a result,\nwe determine the amount of debt awarded to Brian to be\n$1,115,630.\n   However, other debts were inconsistently listed on the joint\nproperty statements or the evidence varied as to the amounts\nowed, including the Great Western Bank operating line of\ncredit, a Sears credit card debt, and a Cabela’s credit card debt.\n   At trial, the president of Great Western Bank and Brian’s\nprimary lender testified that the March 20, 2014, balance\nsheet accurately stated that Brian owed $1,486 on the operat-\ning line of credit on that date but that it had no balance owed\non the date of separation. Dori did not challenge this wit-\nness’ credibility, and the court made no finding that he was\nnot credible.\n   In regard to the Sears and Cabela’s credit cards, Dori intro-\nduced evidence to show that both debts were paid in full on\nthe date of separation.\n   Brian also claimed for the first time on the second joint\nproperty statement that he had a marital debt from unpaid\nproperty taxes. Under the title of the debt, Brian listed the four\nproperties, presumably, from which the taxes were owed. One\nof these was the Roberts farm, but the others were premarital\nproperties. Real estate taxes on nonmarital property are non-\nmarital debts.34 Brian did not submit any supporting evidence\n\n34\t\n      2 Brett R.

We also conclude that Brian failed to submit sufficient\nevidence to show how much, if any, unpaid taxes he owed on\nthe Roberts farm; accordingly, the court did not err in failing\nto assign it.\n             (iii) Brian Should Have Been Awarded\n                    Value of Reduction in His\n                    Premarital Debts as Asset\n   [15] “[A] non-owning spouse is entitled to some ben-\nefit when marital funds have been expended to improve or\nreduce the debt on the other spouse’s nonmarital property.”35\nAs discussed above, Brian had $918,775.69 in premarital\ndebts between loans on his nonmarital property and expenses\nincurred in the production of his 2011 crop. According to\nBrian’s premarital debts listed on the March 20, 2014, bal-\nance sheet, only $209,951 of these debts existed on the date of\nseparation. As a result, Brian’s premarital debts were reduced,\nduring the marriage, by approximately $708,824.69. In light\nof the fact that we set off the premarital value of Brian’s bank\naccounts and stored and growing crop inventory, it would be\ninequitable to not also include in the marital estate this benefit\nconferred to Brian. Accordingly, we award Brian the value of\nhis premarital debts reduced with marital funds.\n                 4.

Further,\nwe reasoned:\n         Considering that no children were born to the parties,\n      that the parties separated after 2 years, that the marriage\n      lasted 38 months, that [the husband’s] career was well\n      established, and that [the wife] is highly educated and\n      capable of finding employment, we conclude that the trial\n      court’s adherence to the general guidelines was an abuse\n      of discretion.42\nAccordingly, based on the circumstances of the case, which\nwe stated were “unique,” we reversed the court’s order grant-\ning the wife 33 percent of the marital estate and held that the\nwife was entitled to only $950,000, or about 12 percent of the\nmarital estate.43\n   In the instant case, we reject Brian’s argument that the\ncircumstances warrant deviating from our general rule for\n\n41\t\n      Id. at 670, 578 N.W.2d at 859.\n42\t\n      Id. at 671, 578 N.W.2d at 859.\n43\t\n      Id. at 672, 578 N.W.2d at 860.\n\f                             - 370 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                  OSANTOWSKI v.

While some of the factors for\ndividing the marital estate in this case are similar to those in\nDavidson, the unique circumstances in Davidson that war-\nranted the deviation is not.\n   The facts in Davidson were unique because the husband’s\ncareer reached its zenith at the same time that the parties mar-\nried. As a result of the husband’s career-long efforts, he was\ntwice promoted during the short-term marriage, which resulted\nin his receiving employee stock options and stock retention\nshares far in excess of his regular salary. While we accounted\nfor the portion of the option and shares that were nonmari-\ntal, the remaining value had still resulted substantially from\nhis premarital efforts and the husband had no ability to pre-\nvent these assets from becoming marital as they were income\nfrom employment.\n   Because we decided that Brian was entitled to a setoff of\nhis premarital assets above, there is nothing in this case that\napproaches the inequity we found in Davidson.\n   Admittedly, the following factors in this case are similar\nto those in Davidson: the marriage was short term, no chil-\ndren were born of the marriage, Brian contributed a dispro-\nportionate amount of finances to the estate, Dori received a\nprofessional doctoral degree during the marriage, and both\nparties are well situated to engage in gainful employment.\nAlso, unlike in Davidson, Dori did not forgo any employment\nopportunities, and, while she changed her educational plans,\nDori received a comparable education to what she would have\nin South Dakota.\n   While these factors may support awarding Dori only 33 per-\ncent of the marital estate, as the lower court in Davidson had,\nthe circumstances of the parties and their contributions to the\nmarriage support a more equal distribution.\n   In Davidson, the wife made little contribution to the mar-\nriage, financially or through other efforts, which we described\nas occasional tutoring of the husband’s son and volunteer work.\n   Here, Dori worked full time during her breaks from school\nand after graduation, and she received financial support from\n\f                             - 371 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v.

While she earned less than\nBrian, she bore most of the costs of the apartment in Lincoln,\nher living expenses in Lincoln, and her travel expenses. Brian,\non the other hand, lived in a house provided by his parents\nand provided no evidence of expenses outside of his farming\noperation. Brian provided little financial support to Dori dur-\ning the marriage, which prevented her from accruing savings\nor other assets.\n   Further, while her education was comparable to what she\nwould have received, she changed her field of study to enable\nher to contribute to the farming operation. While her contribu-\ntions to the farming operation during the marriage were mini-\nmal, what she did contribute was based primarily on knowl-\nedge she obtained from her studies, which showed the utility of\nthe educational decisions she made.\n   Additionally, Dori bore the majority of the burden of travel\nduring the marriage to allow the parties to see each other.\nDuring the portion of the marriage when Dori resided in\nLincoln, she still traveled to the Polk County residence 3 or\n4 days a week. During the other portion of the marriage when\nDori resided in Polk County, she commuted to Lincoln for\nschool and her full-time summer employment. Brian traveled\nto Lincoln frequently during the first winter of the marriage\nbut carried little of the burden thereafter. Further, Dori was\nsolely responsible for maintaining her Lincoln residence and\nalso put in considerable efforts at the Polk County residence.\nBrian testified that she would provide extra assistance at the\nPolk County residence during his busy season, which allowed\nhim to focus on his farming operation.\n   While reasonable minds could differ as to what the appropri-\nate distribution of the marital estate within the general range\nshould have been in this case, an abuse of discretion is a highly\ndeferential standard of review. Our opinion, based on an inde-\npendent review of the record, supplants the court’s decision\nonly in the instance where its decision was untenable. Brian\ncontributed more financially to the marital estate, but Dori also\nearned income throughout the marriage and was responsible\n\f                             - 372 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   298 Nebraska R eports\n                   OSANTOWSKI v.

She also bore a disproportionate\namount of homemaking duties and the burden to ensure she\nand Brian could spend time together regularly during the mar-\nriage. Finally, as the trial court reasoned, Brian had the oppor-\ntunity to keep his family gifts and nonmarital property con-\ntributions, which contributed heavily to his earnings, separate\nfrom the estate, but did not. Accordingly, we cannot say that\nthe decision by the district court was unreasonable or unfair.\n   Brian presented no evidence to support his claim that the\nequalization payment would threaten the continuation of his\nbusiness. He was awarded substantial cash assets, prepaid\nfarming expenses for 2014, and the crops produced that year,\nthe expenses of which would likely have been paid in the prior\nyear when they were produced. Accordingly, we find no merit\nto his claim that requiring him to make an equalization pay-\nment was unfair.\n                       V. CONCLUSION\n   We affirm the court’s decision that stored and growing\ncrops should not be treated the same as cattle herds for trac-\ning purposes, but we hold that the court committed an abuse\nof discretion and plain error in its distribution of nonmarital\nand marital assets and debts. Notably, based on the circum-\nstances of this case, we find that the court erred in not setting\noff the value of Brian’s stored and growing crops on the date\nof marriage and not assigning a credit to the marital estate for\nthe substantial amount of Brian’s premarital debts that were\nreduced during the marriage.\n   Further, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion\nin awarding Dori one-half of the marital estate. In light of our\nholdings above, we modify the court’s order consistent with\nthis opinion and order Brian to make an equalization payment\nof $260,761.15.\n                                         A ffirmed as modified.\n   Wright, J., not participating in the decision.\n\f</pre>",
