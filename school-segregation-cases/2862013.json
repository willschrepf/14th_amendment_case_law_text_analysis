(WCAB No. ADJ1310387)\n\n\n\n        We granted Contra Costa County’s (the County) petition for a writ of review,\nwhich challenged a Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board’s (the WCAB) decision\nawarding Doreen Dahl a permanent disability rating of 79 percent.1 The workers’\ncompensation judge (the WCJ) initially found, and both parties agree, that Dahl’s\npermanent disability rating as determined by the California Permanent Disability Rating\nSchedule (the Schedule) is 59 percent. Dahl sought to rebut that rating, invoking Ogilvie\nv. Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1262 (Ogilvie).\nOgilvie held that there are only three ways in which the scheduled rating for an injured\nemployee may permissibly be rebutted. Dahl sought to invoke the second method\napproved in Ogilvie (the “LeBoeuf method”)2 under which the employee shows she “will\n\n        1\n        Four amici have filed briefs in support of the County: California Chamber of\nCommerce, California Workers’ Compensation Institute, California Association of Joint\nPowers Authorities, and the California State Associations of Counties–Excess Insurance\nAuthority (CSAC-EIA). One amicus, the California Applicants’ Attorneys Association\n(CAAA), has filed a brief in support of Dahl.\n        2\n       The method was approved by the California Supreme Court in LeBoeuf v.\nWorkers’ Compensation Appeals Board (1983) 34 Cal.3d 234 (LeBoeuf).\n\n\n                                             1\n\fhave a greater loss of future earnings than reflected in a rating because, due to the\nindustrial injury, the employee is not amenable to rehabilitation.” (Ogilvie, 197\nCal.App.4th at p. 1275.) Dahl’s “rebuttal,” however, included no evidence that the\nindustrial injuries she sustained to her neck and shoulder rendered her incapable of\nrehabilitation. Rather, her “rebuttal” consisted solely of a vocational expert’s opinion\nthat his method for determining Dahl’s diminished future earnings capacity produced a\nhigher rating than that of the rating produced by the Schedule and that his method more\naccurately measured Dahl’s diminished future earnings.\n         Dahl’s attempted rebuttal did not comport with any of the methods approved in\nOgilvie for rebutting the rating provided using the rating schedule and is therefore\nforeclosed by Ogilvie. Accordingly, we reverse the WCAB’s decision, and annul the\naward.\n                                        BACKGROUND\n                                                 I.\n                                        Legal Framework\n         The extent of an injured workers’ compensation applicant’s permanent disability is\nassessed by reference to the statutorily defined Schedule. (Lab. Code § 4660, subd. (d).)3\nThe Schedule consists of four components: (1) the nature of the physical injury or\ndisfigurement; (2) the occupation of the applicant; (3) the age of the applicant; and (4) the\napplicant’s diminished future earnings capacity. (§ 4660, subd. (a).) “The nature of the\nphysical injury or impairment to be rated in the schedule is to be based upon the\nAmerican Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, and\n‘an employee’s diminished future earning capacity shall be a numeric formula based\nupon empirical data and findings . . . prepared by the RAND Institute for Civil\nJustice . . . .’ (§ 4660, subd. (b)(1) & (2).) The schedule is to ‘promote consistency,\nuniformity, and objectivity,’ (§ 4660, subd. (d)), and the scheduled rating is ‘prima facie\n\n\n\n         3\n             All future statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fevidence of the percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to each injury covered\nby the schedule.’ (§ 4660, subd. (c).).” (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1271.)\n       In Ogilvie, Division Three of this court addressed “whether, in light of the\namendments to section 4660 enacted in Senate Bill No. 899 [in 2004], it is permissible to\ndepart from a scheduled rating on the basis of vocational expert opinion that an employee\nhas a greater loss of future earning capacity than reflected in a scheduled rating.”\n(Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1271.) Giving consideration to the purpose behind\nand the language of the amendments, the Ogilvie court answered this question with a\nqualified “yes.” It held that there are three permissible methods by which the scheduled\nrating could be rebutted.\n       First, the court concluded that the Legislature left unchanged the case law\nallowing “the schedule to be rebutted when a party can show a factual error in the\napplication of a formula or the preparation of the schedule.” (Ogilvie, supra, 197\nCal.App.4th at p. 1273.) Second, the Legislature also left intact the cases, including\nLeBoeuf, recognizing “that a scheduled rating has been effectively rebutted . . . when the\ninjury to the employee impairs his or her rehabilitation, and for that reason, the\nemployee’s diminished future earning capacity is greater than reflected in the employee’s\nscheduled rating.” (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1274.) The court interpreted\nLeBoeuf and its progeny as limited in application “to cases where the employee’s\ndiminished future earnings are directly attributable to the employee’s work-related injury,\nand not due to nonindustrial factors.” (Id. at pp. 1274–1275.) Third and finally, the court\nheld “[a] scheduled rating may be rebutted when a claimant can demonstrate that the\nnature or severity of the claimant’s injury is not captured within the sampling of disabled\nworkers that was used to compute the adjustment factor.” (Id. at p. 1276.)\n       In Ogilvie, Ogilvie and her employer each submitted estimates of her diminished\nfuture earning capacity from vocational rehabilitation experts who compared her earnings\nbefore the injury with what she could be expected to earn after it. “Each expert\nconsidered his evaluation to be superior to the scheduled rating because he considered\nsuch things as Ogilvie’s education, skills, motivation, local job market conditions, work\n\n\n                                              3\n\fhistory, and vocational testing in arriving at Ogilvie’s loss of earning capacity.” (Ogilvie,\nsupra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1267.) The WCJ agreed that the scheduled rating did not\nsufficiently compensate her and set about devising his own methodologies. (Id. at\npp. 1267–1268.) The WCAB created yet another methodology “that it considered\nconsistent with section 4660, and was intended to replicate the empirically based method\nused in the RAND study that established the diminished future earning capacity\nadjustment in the rating schedule.” (Id. at p. 1268)\n       On writ review, this court rejected the WCAB methodology, holding “[n]othing in\nthe Senate Bill No. 899 authorizes or compels the calculation of an alternative diminished\nearning capacity adjustment factor as the WCAB devised in order to resolve Ogilvie’s\nclaim. When it devised this new methodology, the WCAB acted in excess of its authority.\nThe means an employee may use to challenge a scheduled rating due to diminished\nearning capacity are described in the reported cases that predate Senate Bill No. 899.”\nAnd although the parties’ “vocational experts determined that Ogilvie’s anticipated loss\nof future earnings will be greater than reflected in a permanent disability award based on\nthe rating schedule,” the court remanded for further proceedings because it could “not\ndetermine on this record the degree to which the experts may have taken impermissible\nfactors into account in reaching their conclusions.” (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1277.)\n                                             II.\n                             Factual and Procedural History\n       During a period that ended in March 2005, Dahl sustained a cumulative industrial\ninjury to her neck and right shoulder while employed by the County as a medical records\ntechnician. The injuries resulted in surgeries and scarring. At the time of the injuries,\nshe was 49 years old and had worked for the county for over 8 years. Dahl has a\nbachelor’s degree from CSU Hayward and a felony conviction for possession and sale of\nmethamphetamine.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       The parties’ Agreed Medical Examiner (AME), Dr. Mechel Henry, found no basis\nfor apportionment,4 and the parties agreed that she correctly evaluated the whole person\nimpairment (WPI) caused by Dahl’s injury in accordance with the AMA Guides as\nrequired by statute. They also agreed that the WPI found by Henry resulted in a rating of\n59 percent disability. However, Dahl sought to rebut the scheduled rating through a\nvocational expert (Jeffrey Malmuth), and the County sought to counter that with its own\nexpert (Ira Cohen).\n       It does not appear Dahl sought to employ either the first rebuttal method approved\nin Ogilvie (factual error in application of a formula or preparation of the schedule) or the\nthird (nature or severity of claimant’s injury not captured within sampling of disabled\nworkers used to compute the adjustment factor). Thus, the WCJ found “no evidence that\n[Dahl’s] impairments or the disability ratings derived from them are either\nmathematically incorrect or medically deviant from the injuries enumerated in the Guides\nor the rating schedule.” Rather, Dahl sought to invoke the second Ogilvie rebuttal\nmethod. As the WCJ noted, Dahl’s expert and the County’s “produced reports and trial\ntestimony offering various conflicting percentages of lost earning capacity, leading to\nvarious permanent disability ratings.”\n       At the evidentiary hearing in March 2011, Malmuth testified that he relied on the\nmedical opinions of Dr. Henry that Dahl has pain and cervical and upper extremity\nlimitations but acknowledged that Dahl has some earning capacity. He testified that her\nability to get a job is affected by factors other than her injury. He opined that Dahl\n“cannot compete successfully with uninjured job applicants, given the entire constellation\nof factors, despite having some earning capacity.”\n       Malmuth did his own calculations regarding Dahl’s diminished future earning\ncapacity. He “attempted to establish a DFEC [diminished future earnings capacity] based\n\n       4\n        “ ‘Apportionment is the process employed by the Board to segregate the\nresiduals of an industrial injury from those attributable to other industrial injuries, or to\nnonindustrial factors, in order to fairly allocate the legal responsibility.’ ” (Brodie v.\nWorkers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2007) 40 Cal.4th 1313, 1321.)\n\n\n                                               5\n\fnot on applicant’s individual assets and detriments but on those of a theoretical group of\n‘similarly situated employees.’ ” He “compared the earning ability of similarly-situated\nemployees against that of this employee.” “The jobs he studied were based on the\nconclusions reached by Dr. Henry.” The limitations involving Dahl’s shoulder led to\nlimitations in the labor market Malmuth considered. Malmuth testified that Dahl was\nearning $25.56 per hour at the time of her injury, which would be between the 75th and\n90th percentile for employees in the category he considered similar. Her post-injury\nearning capacity would be limited to the 50th percentile of wages or below “because of\nher work-related medical condition,” which caused him to use the “average” figure of\n$9.13 per hour for her post-injury earning capacity. Malmuth opined that “the most\naccurate measure of [Dahl’s] lost earning capacity” was about 87 percent. He considered\nDahl’s education, but opined that jobs that would use her education were precluded by\nher injury because of her limitations including her inability to use a computer. On cross-\nexamination, he testified that she would be helped by vocational rehabilitation, including\nvoice recognition and other things. He acknowledged that Dahl was a good rehabilitation\ncandidate and could go to school and get a master’s degree. She could employ vocational\nrehabilitation to have access to more of the labor market, and if she did her earning\ncapacity would rise.\n       The County’s vocational expert (Cohen) agreed with Malmuth that Dahl “would\nbenefit from vocational rehabilitation,” get a master’s degree and “raise her earning\ncapacity.” He disagreed with Malmuth’s calculation of Dahl’s earning capacity. He\ncriticized Malmuth for treating plaintiff as unskilled, focusing on too few job areas,\nfailing to account for her skills or aptitude and using too low a percentile regarding her\npotential wages. Dahl “could do more jobs than Mr. Malmuth indicates.” Cohen used\nthe code for a bachelor’s degree in evaluating her earning capacity. He reviewed her\nmedical and other records, physical limitations, educational history, vocational history,\nAME evaluation, deposition, payroll records from the County, performed vocational\ntesting and interviewed Dahl. Taking into account all of this information and her age,\neducation, skills, aptitude, the general condition of the labor market and occupations\n\n\n                                             6\n\fcompatible with her profile, he opined that her proportional earnings loss due to the\ninjury was 30 percent. According to Malmuth, Cohen’s earnings loss percentage would\nresult in a disability rating of about 77 percent.\n       The Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) determined that Dahl’s injury caused a\npermanent disability of 59 percent pursuant to the Schedule. The WCJ held that, under\nOgilvie, Dahl failed to rebut her diminished future earning capacity factor because she\ncould not show her injury caused a total loss of future earning capacity or 100 percent\npermanent disability. The WCJ did not address whether she would have met her rebuttal\nburden if Ogilvie permitted a loss of future earning capacity less than 100 percent.\n       On appeal from this decision, the WCAB agreed with the WCJ that there was no\nevidence to support rebuttal under the first or third Ogilvie methods. However, it rejected\nthe WCJ’s interpretation of Ogilvie, and held that Dahl could rebut the scheduled rating\nby showing the injury impaired her amenability to rehabilitation, even where there was\nless than total permanent disability. For this reason, it rescinded the WCJ’s findings and\naward and “return[ed] the case to the trial level for development of the record and a new\ndecision on whether applicant’s rebuttal of the DFEC supports a finding of permanent\ndisability that is higher than calculated under the PDRS [rating schedule].”\n       On remand, the WCJ heard additional testimony from the same two vocational\nexperts on whether the diminished future earning capacity rating properly reflected\nDahl’s future earning capacity. Malmuth again testified that Dahl was a good\nrehabilitation candidate. Nonetheless, he attempted to establish Dahl’s future earning\ncapacity based not on her individual assets and detriments, but on those of a theoretical\ngroup of similarly situated employees. According to Malmuth, this approach precluded\nconsideration of Dahl’s education. He opined that the scheduled rating understated her\nloss of future earning capacity.\n       Cohen again adopted a more individualized approach, though he declined to\nconsider Dahl’s felony conviction. He concluded that Dahl’s scheduled rating actually\noverstated her loss of future earning capacity.\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f       The WCJ found Cohen’s conclusions were now contrary to the law of the case.\nThe judge reasoned the WCAB had already ruled that Dahl showed she had a greater\ndiminished earning capacity than reflected in the scheduled rating. The WCJ also found\nMalmuth’s method more persuasive than Cohen’s because it eliminated from the\ndiminished future earning capacity calculation any impermissible factors not stemming\nfrom Dahl’s industrial injury. The WCJ assigned Dahl’s right shoulder impairment a\nscore of 64 percent, and taking into account her other injuries, assigned Dahl a total\npermanent disability of 79 percent. In the belief that the WCAB had already decided the\nissue, the WCJ did not consider whether Dahl had shown that her injury impaired her\nprospects for vocational rehabilitation, much less whether any such impairment caused\nher to suffer a greater loss of future earning capacity as required by Ogilvie. (Ogilvie,\nsupra, 197 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1274–1275, 1277.)\n       The County appealed to the WCAB through a petition for reconsideration. The\nWCAB affirmed. In doing so, it again concluded that “complete lack of amenability to\nvocational rehabilitation” is not “necessary before a LeBoeuf analysis may be properly\napplied.” The WCAB also accepted Malmuth’s method for determining Dahl’s\ndiminished future earning capacity (accepted by the WCJ) of “look[ing] at the effect such\nan injury [as Dahl’s] would have upon the DFEC of similarly situated workers” as\nconsistent with Ogilvie. The WCAB opinion does not discuss what evidence, if any,\nincluding Malmuth’s computations, demonstrated that Dahl’s injury impaired her\namenability to rehabilitation, much less that such impairment was the cause of greater\nloss of earning capacity than the scheduled rating reflected.\n       The County subsequently petitioned for a writ of review, which we granted.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       The County argues the WCJ and WCAB erred by straying from the scheduled\nrating established by the Schedule. The County concedes that, under Ogilvie, Dahl could\nrebut her scheduled rating by showing her injury precluded vocational rehabilitation but\ncontends the WCAB completely ignored evidence Dahl was amenable to rehabilitation.\nThe County and various amici also take issue with the manner in which the WCAB\n\n\n                                             8\n\fcalculated Dahl’s diminished future earning capacity, as well as her revised rating. We\nagree that Dahl failed to rebut her scheduled rating by showing her injury precluded\nvocational rehabilitation. Accordingly, we need not and do not reach the other arguments\nraised by the County and amici.\n       Our review is limited to determining whether the WCAB acted “without or in\nexcess of its powers” and whether its decision was unreasonable, not supported by\nsubstantial evidence or procured by fraud. (§ 5952, subds. (a)–(d).) We may also\ndetermine if findings of fact support the order. (§ 5952, subd. (e).) “The findings and\nconclusions of the appeals board on questions of fact are conclusive and final and are not\nsubject to review.” (§ 5953.) “[U]nless clearly erroneous[,] the WCAB’s interpretation\nof the workers’ compensation laws is entitled to great weight.” (Genlyte Group., LLC v.\nWorkers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 705, 714.) Nevertheless, issues of\nstatutory interpretation and questions of law are subject to our independent review, and\nwe need not defer to the WCAB’s legal determinations where they are contrary to the\nplain meaning of the statute or prevailing case law. (See ibid.)\n       As all parties acknowledge, the resolution of this case turns on Ogilvie. In that\ncase, the WCAB found a workers’ compensation applicant could rebut his diminished\nfuture earning capacity adjustment by proposing an alternative earning capacity, so long\nas the applicant used a numeric formula based on empirical data and findings. (Ogilvie,\nsupra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1268.) After granting a petition for review, our colleagues\nin Division 3 found the WCAB had erred because, under the 2004 amendments to the\nworkers’ compensation scheme, the statutory rating schedule “is to be ‘prima facie\nevidence of the percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to each injury covered\nby the schedule’ (§ 4660, subd. (c)).” (Id. at p. 1272.) There was “no indication some\nother measure may be substituted for the earning capacity component in order to arrive\nat an overall rating most suitable for a particular employee.” (Ibid.) The court suggested\nthe WCAB’s approach was contrary to the purpose of the amendments, which was to\n“ ‘alleviate a perceived crisis in skyrocketing workers’ compensation costs’ ” and to\n“ ‘promote consistency, uniformity, and objectivity.’ ” (Id. at pp. 1270–1273.)\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       While the statutory Schedule was presumptively correct, the court held it could be\nrebutted using methods recognized prior to the 2004 amendments. (Ogilvie, supra, 197\nCal.App.4th at p. 1273.) Nothing in the statutory text or legislative history indicated the\nLegislature intended “ ‘to overthrow [these] long-established principles of law.’ ” (Ibid.)\nThe court identified three such methods. (Id. at p. 1277.) First, an employee could rebut\nthe scheduled rating by showing a factual error in the application of a formula or the\npreparation of the schedule. (Id. at p. 1273.) Second, the employee could show “the\ninjury . . . impairs his or her rehabilitation, and for that reason, the employee’s diminished\nfuture earning capacity is greater than reflected in the employee’s scheduled rating.” (Id.\nat p. 1274.) Third, in certain rare cases, an employee may show the amalgamation of data\nused to arrive at a diminished future earning capacity do not capture the severity of all of\nthe medical complications of an employee’s work-related injury. (Id. at p. 1275.)\n       The court derived the second method from our Supreme Court’s opinion in\nLeBoeuf, supra, 34 Cal.3d 234. (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1274.) In\nLeBoeuf, the claimant, who had been awarded 60 percent permanent disability, moved to\nreopen his compensation proceedings based on the Bureau of Rehabilitation’s finding\nthat he would be unable to return to suitable gainful employment through vocational\nrehabilitation services. (LeBoeuf, supra, 34 Cal.3d at pp. 238–240.) The WCJ and\nWCAB denied his request. (Id. at p. 240.) The court found this was error, stating: “Just\nas retraining may increase a worker’s ability to compete in the labor market, a\ndetermination that he or she cannot be retrained for any suitable gainful employment may\nadversely affect a worker’s overall ability to compete. Accordingly, that factor should be\nconsidered in any determination of a permanent disability rating.” (Id. at p. 243.)\n       In Ogilvie, the court concluded the LeBoeuf approach was limited to cases “where\nthe employee’s diminished future earnings are directly attributable to the employee’s\nwork-related injury, and not due to nonindustrial factors such as general economic\nconditions, illiteracy, proficiency in speaking English, or an employee’s lack of\neducation.” (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1275.) “This application of LeBoeuf\nhews most closely to an employer’s responsibility . . . to ‘compensate only for such\n\n\n                                             10\n\fdisability or need for treatment as is occupationally related.’ ” (Ibid.) In support, the\ncourt cited to a number of workers’ compensation cases dealing with an employee’s\nability to rehabilitate. (Ibid.) In most of these cases, the WCAB denied claimants’\npetitions for reconsideration because their inability to benefit from rehabilitation was due,\nat least in part, to pre-existing nonindustrial factors that had nothing to with their\ninjuries.5\n       Dahl’s attempt to rebut her disability rating bears little resemblance to any of the\nmethods described in Ogilvie, including the rebuttal method derived from LeBoeuf. Dahl\ndid not explain how her injury prevented her from participating in vocational\nrehabilitation. In fact, Dahl’s own vocational expert conceded that she was a good\nrehabilitation candidate and also stated a discussion of vocational rehabilitation was\n“irrelevant.” The gravamen of Dahl’s rebuttal is that her expert’s analysis of the earning\ncapacity—based on the earnings loss of a group of individuals that the expert identified\nas more similarly situated to Dahl than the group identified in the Schedule for someone\nwith her characteristics—is superior to the method and rating called for by the statute.\nThis approach is at odds with Ogilvie, which rejected a similar attempt to simply\nsubstitute a vocational expert’s or judge- or board-preferred methodology for the\nstatutorily prescribed rating system. Ogilvie signaled that it would be a rare case in\nwhich an applicant or employer could rebut a scheduled rating. Yet under the WCAB’s\napproach here, claimants would be permitted to rebut their scheduled rating in virtually\nall cases where an expert can provide a statistical analysis of a group of individuals he or\nshe claims is more similarly situated to the applicant than that identified in the Schedule.\nAs amicus curiae California Association of Joint Powers Authorities points out, the\n\n\n\n       5\n         See James v.

This necessarily requires an individualized approach.\nFor example, in Gottschalks v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board (2003) 68\nCal.Comp.Cases 1714, 1716 (writ denied), one of the compensation cases cited in\nOgilvie, the WCAB denied an employer’s petition for reconsideration of a 100-percent\ndisability rating where Oxycontin, a medication used to treat the claimant’s industrial\ninjury, had a “ ‘severe [e]ffect’ ” on the claimant’s ability to work. The focus was on the\nlimitations flowing from the claimant’s particular condition, not the earning potential of\nsimilarly situated individuals who might be subject to different limitations. It is this\nindividualized assessment of whether industrial factors preclude the employee’s\nrehabilitation that Ogilvie approved as a method for rebutting the Schedule. The Ogilvie\ncourt did not sanction rebuttal of the statutory Schedule by a competing empirical\nmethodology—no matter how superior the applicant and her expert claim it may be.\n       In this case, the County presented evidence Dahl’s injury did not prevent her from\ntaking advantage of retraining opportunities or finding another job. Dahl’s medical\nevaluator has not provided any formal work restrictions. Moreover, Cohen, the County’s\nvocational expert, concluded Dahl had the ability to work in selected occupations in the\nopen labor mark, including sedentary, semi-sedentary and light work positions. Cohen\nalso found Dahl possessed above-average problem solving, reading, spelling and\narithmetic skills, commensurate with the college degree she earned in 2003, indicating\nshe has the cognitive ability to perform any of the occupations for which her college\ndegree prepared her.\n       Malmuth, Dahl’s vocational expert, did not present contrary evidence. He testified\nDahl had at least some earning capacity, and concluded there was no medical evidence\nshe could not work eight hours per day. When asked if Dahl was an ideal candidate for\nrehabilitation, Malmuth responded that, with some training, including voice recognition\n\n\n                                             12\n\fand other things, “she would be helped.” Malmuth further testified Dahl performed “very\nwell” on testing, and that her college education could increase her earning capacity.\nMalmuth also opined that, even with her injury, Dahl could perform certain jobs without\nretraining.\n       Nevertheless, Malmuth concluded Dahl is not amenable to rehabilitation because\nit would not restore her, or a similarly situated worker, to full pre-injury earning capacity.\nBut this is precisely what the statutory formula for diminished future earning capacity\nfactor is intended to capture. Most work-related injuries that qualify an employee for\nworkers’ compensation benefits reduce earning potential to some degree. Thus, allowing\na claimant to rebut his or her permanent disability rating through a showing of some\ndiminished future earning capacity would render the statutory formula virtually\nmeaningless. Nothing in Ogilvie or any of the case law on which it relies suggests\ndeparture from the statutory rating system is permissible whenever an employee cannot\nbe returned to his or her pre-injury earning capacity.\n       Based on this record, there was no basis for the WCJ or the WCAB to conclude\nDahl had rebutted her scheduled diminished future earning capacity by showing she was\nnot amenable to vocational rehabilitation. In fact, it appears no such finding was made in\nthe proceedings below. The WCJ initially held Dahl could not rebut her scheduled rating\nbecause she failed to show her injury resulted in a total loss of earning capacity. On a\npetition for review, the WCAB disagreed that rebuttal based on a claimant’s ability to\nrehabilitate was only available in cases involving 100-percent total permanent disability.\nThe WCAB accepted Dahl’s contention “that a LeBoeuf type of analysis may be properly\napplied . . . when it is shown that the injury impairs the employee’s rehabilitation, as in\nthis case.” However, the WCAB did not refer to any specific evidence that would\nsupport such a finding as to Dahl’s rehabilitation prospects. On remand, the WCJ held\nthe WCAB’s decision after reconsideration conclusively established Dahl had rebutted\nthe scheduled rating but did not identify any evidence showing Dahl’s injuries precluded\nrehabilitation. We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f       The WCJ relied on the language, which we have italicized, from the following\nparagraph of the WCAB decision: “Application of a LeBoeuf type of analysis in cases of\npartial permanent disability requires expert opinion on the effect of the injury’s\nimpairment on the worker’s amenability to rehabilitation and the effect of that on DFEC.\nSuch an analysis can be done even where there is less than total permanent disability, as\nin this case where the employee has rebutted the PDRS by showing that she will have a\ngreater DFEC than reflected in the PDRS rating.” This language, while less than clear,\ndoes not reflect a finding that Dahl had already met her burden; it indicates only that the\nWCAB viewed it as permissible for her to meet her burden without claiming to be 100-\npercent disabled. Indeed, as indicated above, the WCAB remanded for further\ndevelopment of the record to ascertain whether Dahl’s rebuttal showing supported a\nfinding of disability greater than her scheduled disability—i.e., whether she had satisfied\nthe second method approved in Ogilvie for rebutting her scheduled rating. (See Ogilvie,\nsupra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1277 [“we conclude that an employee may challenge the\npresumptive scheduled percentage of permanent disability prescribed to an injury . . . by\ndemonstrating that due to industrial injury the employee is not amenable to rehabilitation\nand therefore has suffered a greater loss of future earning capacity than reflected in the\nscheduled rating”].) The WCAB thus remanded the case not because it concluded Dahl\nhad already made that showing, but to allow the WCJ to determine whether she had done\nso.\n       We are skeptical of WCAB’s conclusion that an employee may invoke the second\nOgilvie rebuttal method where the inability to rehabilitate results in less than a 100-\npercent permanent disability.6 However, we need not decide this issue since the County\n\n\n       6\n         For the same reason as the rule advocated by Malmuth allowing rebuttal\nwhenever an employee shows she cannot be expected to earn the same as she did prior to\ninjury, a partial impairment rule would allow for rebuttal in a wide swath of cases. Many\ninjured employees cannot return to the precise position they held before their injury or to\nan equally remunerative one. Ogilvie does not appear to contemplate rebuttal of the\nscheduled rating in this circumstance, since the Schedule’s formula for determining\ndiminished future earning capacity takes into account such limitations. Notably, the two\n\n                                             14\n\fdid not seek a writ from the WCAB decision adopting the partial impairment rule. In any\nevent, even if an employee’s ability to rehabilitate need only be impaired (and not\neliminated) in order to rebut the schedule, Dahl failed to make such a showing here. As\ndiscussed above, both Dahl and the County’s rehabilitation experts agreed Dahl was a\ngood rehabilitation candidate, and the evidence suggests she can increase her earning\npotential through retraining. There is no evidence that the injury even limited her\nrehabilitation prospects.\n       Dahl argues she successfully rebutted the scheduled rating because the state\nceased providing a vocational rehabilitation program for injured workers as of January 1,\n2003. We disagree. As the County points out, section 4658.5 does provide for workers’\ncompensation vouchers that may be used to pay tuition and other expenses required for\nretraining. Specifically, the statute provides that an injured employee who does not\nreturn to work for the employer within 60 days of the termination of temporary disability\nshall be eligible for a voucher for education-related retraining or skill enhancement at a\nstate-approved or accredited school. (§ 4658.5, subd. (b).) For disability awards between\n50 and 99 percent, the voucher may be up to $10,000. (§ 4658.5, subd. (b)(4).) The\napplicant in Ogilvie was presumably eligible for identical benefits, as this provision was\nlast amended in 2003. Moreover, Ogilvie holds claimants must show they are not\namenable to rehabilitation due to their industrial injury, not due to extraneous factors,\nsuch as the cessation of certain state-sponsored rehabilitation benefits. (Ogilvie, supra,\n197 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1274–1275.) To hold otherwise would mean every employee\ncould now rebut their scheduled rating using a LeBoeuf analysis, turning a limited\nexception into the general rule. There is no indication Ogilvie intended the second\nrebuttal method to be so broad and all-encompassing.\n\n\n\n\ncases cited by Ogilvie which found claimants were unable to rehabilitate involved injuries\nthat rendered the claimants unable to return to any type of gainful employment. (See\nLeBoeuf, supra, 34 Cal.3d at pp. 239–240; Gottschalks v. Workers’ Compensation\nAppeals Bd., supra, 68 Cal.Comp.Cases at p.1716.)\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       In sum, we find WCAB’s approach in this case flies in the face of Ogilvie and the\n2004 amendments to the workers’ compensation scheme. Under the 2004 amendments, a\nclaimant’s scheduled rating is presumptively correct. Ogilvie confirmed the Legislature\nmeant what it said, and that claimants may not rebut their disability rating merely by\noffering an alternative calculation of their diminished future earning capacity. While\nOgilvie found the 2004 amendments did not overthrow certain long-held approaches to\ncalculating earning capacity, it clearly did not intend those approaches to be construed so\nbroadly as to return us to the ad-hoc decision making that prevailed prior to 2004.\nFollowing the WCAB’s approach in this case would do just that. Claimants could rebut\ntheir presumptively correct disability rating merely by presenting an analysis that shows a\ngreater diminished future earning capacity than that determined by applying the\nSchedule. As Ogilvie makes clear, this approach is no longer permissible.\n                                     DISPOSITION\n       The decision of the WCAB is annulled. We remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f                   STEWART, J.\n\n\n\nWe concur.\n\n\n\n\nKLINE, P.J.\n\n\n\n\nRICHMAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n              17\n\fContra Costa County v.

Dahl’s “rebuttal,” however, included no evidence that the\nindustrial injuries she sustained to her neck and shoulder rendered her incapable of\nrehabilitation. Rather, her “rebuttal” consisted solely of a vocational expert’s opinion\nthat his method for determining Dahl’s diminished future earnings capacity produced a\nhigher rating than that of the rating produced by the Schedule and that his method more\naccurately measured Dahl’s diminished future earnings.\n         Dahl’s attempted rebuttal did not comport with any of the methods approved in\nOgilvie for rebutting the rating provided using the rating schedule and is therefore\nforeclosed by Ogilvie. Accordingly, we reverse the WCAB’s decision, and annul the\naward.\n                                        BACKGROUND\n                                                 I.\n                                        Legal Framework\n         The extent of an injured workers’ compensation applicant’s permanent disability is\nassessed by reference to the statutorily defined Schedule. (Lab. Code § 4660, subd. (d).)3\nThe Schedule consists of four components: (1) the nature of the physical injury or\ndisfigurement; (2) the occupation of the applicant; (3) the age of the applicant; and (4) the\napplicant’s diminished future earnings capacity. (§ 4660, subd. (a).) “The nature of the\nphysical injury or impairment to be rated in the schedule is to be based upon the\nAmerican Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, and\n‘an employee’s diminished future earning capacity shall be a numeric formula based\nupon empirical data and findings . . . prepared by the RAND Institute for Civil\nJustice . . . .’ (§ 4660, subd. (b)(1) & (2).) The schedule is to ‘promote consistency,\nuniformity, and objectivity,’ (§ 4660, subd. (d)), and the scheduled rating is ‘prima facie\n\n\n\n         3\n             All future statutory references are to the Labor Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fevidence of the percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to each injury covered\nby the schedule.’ (§ 4660, subd. (c).).” (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1271.)\n       In Ogilvie, Division Three of this court addressed “whether, in light of the\namendments to section 4660 enacted in Senate Bill No. 899 [in 2004], it is permissible to\ndepart from a scheduled rating on the basis of vocational expert opinion that an employee\nhas a greater loss of future earning capacity than reflected in a scheduled rating.”\n(Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1271.) Giving consideration to the purpose behind\nand the language of the amendments, the Ogilvie court answered this question with a\nqualified “yes.” It held that there are three permissible methods by which the scheduled\nrating could be rebutted.\n       First, the court concluded that the Legislature left unchanged the case law\nallowing “the schedule to be rebutted when a party can show a factual error in the\napplication of a formula or the preparation of the schedule.” (Ogilvie, supra, 197\nCal.App.4th at p. 1273.) Second, the Legislature also left intact the cases, including\nLeBoeuf, recognizing “that a scheduled rating has been effectively rebutted . . . when the\ninjury to the employee impairs his or her rehabilitation, and for that reason, the\nemployee’s diminished future earning capacity is greater than reflected in the employee’s\nscheduled rating.” (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1274.) The court interpreted\nLeBoeuf and its progeny as limited in application “to cases where the employee’s\ndiminished future earnings are directly attributable to the employee’s work-related injury,\nand not due to nonindustrial factors.” (Id. at pp. 1274–1275.) Third and finally, the court\nheld “[a] scheduled rating may be rebutted when a claimant can demonstrate that the\nnature or severity of the claimant’s injury is not captured within the sampling of disabled\nworkers that was used to compute the adjustment factor.” (Id. at p. 1276.)\n       In Ogilvie, Ogilvie and her employer each submitted estimates of her diminished\nfuture earning capacity from vocational rehabilitation experts who compared her earnings\nbefore the injury with what she could be expected to earn after it. “Each expert\nconsidered his evaluation to be superior to the scheduled rating because he considered\nsuch things as Ogilvie’s education, skills, motivation, local job market conditions, work\n\n\n                                              3\n\fhistory, and vocational testing in arriving at Ogilvie’s loss of earning capacity.” (Ogilvie,\nsupra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1267.) The WCJ agreed that the scheduled rating did not\nsufficiently compensate her and set about devising his own methodologies. (Id. at\npp. 1267–1268.) The WCAB created yet another methodology “that it considered\nconsistent with section 4660, and was intended to replicate the empirically based method\nused in the RAND study that established the diminished future earning capacity\nadjustment in the rating schedule.” (Id. at p. 1268)\n       On writ review, this court rejected the WCAB methodology, holding “[n]othing in\nthe Senate Bill No. 899 authorizes or compels the calculation of an alternative diminished\nearning capacity adjustment factor as the WCAB devised in order to resolve Ogilvie’s\nclaim. When it devised this new methodology, the WCAB acted in excess of its authority.\nThe means an employee may use to challenge a scheduled rating due to diminished\nearning capacity are described in the reported cases that predate Senate Bill No. 899.”\nAnd although the parties’ “vocational experts determined that Ogilvie’s anticipated loss\nof future earnings will be greater than reflected in a permanent disability award based on\nthe rating schedule,” the court remanded for further proceedings because it could “not\ndetermine on this record the degree to which the experts may have taken impermissible\nfactors into account in reaching their conclusions.” (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1277.)\n                                             II.\n                             Factual and Procedural History\n       During a period that ended in March 2005, Dahl sustained a cumulative industrial\ninjury to her neck and right shoulder while employed by the County as a medical records\ntechnician. The injuries resulted in surgeries and scarring. At the time of the injuries,\nshe was 49 years old and had worked for the county for over 8 years. Dahl has a\nbachelor’s degree from CSU Hayward and a felony conviction for possession and sale of\nmethamphetamine.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       The parties’ Agreed Medical Examiner (AME), Dr. Mechel Henry, found no basis\nfor apportionment,4 and the parties agreed that she correctly evaluated the whole person\nimpairment (WPI) caused by Dahl’s injury in accordance with the AMA Guides as\nrequired by statute. They also agreed that the WPI found by Henry resulted in a rating of\n59 percent disability. However, Dahl sought to rebut the scheduled rating through a\nvocational expert (Jeffrey Malmuth), and the County sought to counter that with its own\nexpert (Ira Cohen).\n       It does not appear Dahl sought to employ either the first rebuttal method approved\nin Ogilvie (factual error in application of a formula or preparation of the schedule) or the\nthird (nature or severity of claimant’s injury not captured within sampling of disabled\nworkers used to compute the adjustment factor). Thus, the WCJ found “no evidence that\n[Dahl’s] impairments or the disability ratings derived from them are either\nmathematically incorrect or medically deviant from the injuries enumerated in the Guides\nor the rating schedule.” Rather, Dahl sought to invoke the second Ogilvie rebuttal\nmethod. As the WCJ noted, Dahl’s expert and the County’s “produced reports and trial\ntestimony offering various conflicting percentages of lost earning capacity, leading to\nvarious permanent disability ratings.”\n       At the evidentiary hearing in March 2011, Malmuth testified that he relied on the\nmedical opinions of Dr. Henry that Dahl has pain and cervical and upper extremity\nlimitations but acknowledged that Dahl has some earning capacity. He testified that her\nability to get a job is affected by factors other than her injury. He opined that Dahl\n“cannot compete successfully with uninjured job applicants, given the entire constellation\nof factors, despite having some earning capacity.”\n       Malmuth did his own calculations regarding Dahl’s diminished future earning\ncapacity. He “attempted to establish a DFEC [diminished future earnings capacity] based\n\n       4\n        “ ‘Apportionment is the process employed by the Board to segregate the\nresiduals of an industrial injury from those attributable to other industrial injuries, or to\nnonindustrial factors, in order to fairly allocate the legal responsibility.’ ” (Brodie v.\nWorkers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2586149\"><a href=\"/opinion/2586149/brodie-v-workerscomp-appeals-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1321.)\n\n\n                                               5\n\fnot on applicant’s individual assets and detriments but on those of a theoretical group of\n‘similarly situated employees.’ ” He “compared the earning ability of similarly-situated\nemployees against that of this employee.” “The jobs he studied were based on the\nconclusions reached by Dr. Henry.” The limitations involving Dahl’s shoulder led to\nlimitations in the labor market Malmuth considered. Malmuth testified that Dahl was\nearning $25.56 per hour at the time of her injury, which would be between the 75th and\n90th percentile for employees in the category he considered similar. Her post-injury\nearning capacity would be limited to the 50th percentile of wages or below “because of\nher work-related medical condition,” which caused him to use the “average” figure of\n$9.13 per hour for her post-injury earning capacity. Malmuth opined that “the most\naccurate measure of [Dahl’s] lost earning capacity” was about 87 percent. He considered\nDahl’s education, but opined that jobs that would use her education were precluded by\nher injury because of her limitations including her inability to use a computer. On cross-\nexamination, he testified that she would be helped by vocational rehabilitation, including\nvoice recognition and other things. He acknowledged that Dahl was a good rehabilitation\ncandidate and could go to school and get a master’s degree. She could employ vocational\nrehabilitation to have access to more of the labor market, and if she did her earning\ncapacity would rise.\n       The County’s vocational expert (Cohen) agreed with Malmuth that Dahl “would\nbenefit from vocational rehabilitation,” get a master’s degree and “raise her earning\ncapacity.” He disagreed with Malmuth’s calculation of Dahl’s earning capacity. He\ncriticized Malmuth for treating plaintiff as unskilled, focusing on too few job areas,\nfailing to account for her skills or aptitude and using too low a percentile regarding her\npotential wages. Dahl “could do more jobs than Mr. Malmuth indicates.” Cohen used\nthe code for a bachelor’s degree in evaluating her earning capacity. He reviewed her\nmedical and other records, physical limitations, educational history, vocational history,\nAME evaluation, deposition, payroll records from the County, performed vocational\ntesting and interviewed Dahl. Taking into account all of this information and her age,\neducation, skills, aptitude, the general condition of the labor market and occupations\n\n\n                                             6\n\fcompatible with her profile, he opined that her proportional earnings loss due to the\ninjury was 30 percent. According to Malmuth, Cohen’s earnings loss percentage would\nresult in a disability rating of about 77 percent.\n       The Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) determined that Dahl’s injury caused a\npermanent disability of 59 percent pursuant to the Schedule. The WCJ held that, under\nOgilvie, Dahl failed to rebut her diminished future earning capacity factor because she\ncould not show her injury caused a total loss of future earning capacity or 100 percent\npermanent disability. The WCJ did not address whether she would have met her rebuttal\nburden if Ogilvie permitted a loss of future earning capacity less than 100 percent.\n       On appeal from this decision, the WCAB agreed with the WCJ that there was no\nevidence to support rebuttal under the first or third Ogilvie methods. However, it rejected\nthe WCJ’s interpretation of Ogilvie, and held that Dahl could rebut the scheduled rating\nby showing the injury impaired her amenability to rehabilitation, even where there was\nless than total permanent disability. For this reason, it rescinded the WCJ’s findings and\naward and “return[ed] the case to the trial level for development of the record and a new\ndecision on whether applicant’s rebuttal of the DFEC supports a finding of permanent\ndisability that is higher than calculated under the PDRS [rating schedule].”\n       On remand, the WCJ heard additional testimony from the same two vocational\nexperts on whether the diminished future earning capacity rating properly reflected\nDahl’s future earning capacity. Malmuth again testified that Dahl was a good\nrehabilitation candidate. Nonetheless, he attempted to establish Dahl’s future earning\ncapacity based not on her individual assets and detriments, but on those of a theoretical\ngroup of similarly situated employees. According to Malmuth, this approach precluded\nconsideration of Dahl’s education. He opined that the scheduled rating understated her\nloss of future earning capacity.\n       Cohen again adopted a more individualized approach, though he declined to\nconsider Dahl’s felony conviction. He concluded that Dahl’s scheduled rating actually\noverstated her loss of future earning capacity.\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f       The WCJ found Cohen’s conclusions were now contrary to the law of the case.\nThe judge reasoned the WCAB had already ruled that Dahl showed she had a greater\ndiminished earning capacity than reflected in the scheduled rating. The WCJ also found\nMalmuth’s method more persuasive than Cohen’s because it eliminated from the\ndiminished future earning capacity calculation any impermissible factors not stemming\nfrom Dahl’s industrial injury. The WCJ assigned Dahl’s right shoulder impairment a\nscore of 64 percent, and taking into account her other injuries, assigned Dahl a total\npermanent disability of 79 percent. In the belief that the WCAB had already decided the\nissue, the WCJ did not consider whether Dahl had shown that her injury impaired her\nprospects for vocational rehabilitation, much less whether any such impairment caused\nher to suffer a greater loss of future earning capacity as required by Ogilvie. (Ogilvie,\nsupra, 197 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1274–1275, 1277.)\n       The County appealed to the WCAB through a petition for reconsideration. The\nWCAB affirmed. In doing so, it again concluded that “complete lack of amenability to\nvocational rehabilitation” is not “necessary before a LeBoeuf analysis may be properly\napplied.” The WCAB also accepted Malmuth’s method for determining Dahl’s\ndiminished future earning capacity (accepted by the WCJ) of “look[ing] at the effect such\nan injury [as Dahl’s] would have upon the DFEC of similarly situated workers” as\nconsistent with Ogilvie. The WCAB opinion does not discuss what evidence, if any,\nincluding Malmuth’s computations, demonstrated that Dahl’s injury impaired her\namenability to rehabilitation, much less that such impairment was the cause of greater\nloss of earning capacity than the scheduled rating reflected.\n       The County subsequently petitioned for a writ of review, which we granted.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       The County argues the WCJ and WCAB erred by straying from the scheduled\nrating established by the Schedule. The County concedes that, under Ogilvie, Dahl could\nrebut her scheduled rating by showing her injury precluded vocational rehabilitation but\ncontends the WCAB completely ignored evidence Dahl was amenable to rehabilitation.\nThe County and various amici also take issue with the manner in which the WCAB\n\n\n                                             8\n\fcalculated Dahl’s diminished future earning capacity, as well as her revised rating. We\nagree that Dahl failed to rebut her scheduled rating by showing her injury precluded\nvocational rehabilitation. Accordingly, we need not and do not reach the other arguments\nraised by the County and amici.\n       Our review is limited to determining whether the WCAB acted “without or in\nexcess of its powers” and whether its decision was unreasonable, not supported by\nsubstantial evidence or procured by fraud. (§ 5952, subds. (a)–(d).) We may also\ndetermine if findings of fact support the order. (§ 5952, subd. (e).) “The findings and\nconclusions of the appeals board on questions of fact are conclusive and final and are not\nsubject to review.” (§ 5953.) “[U]nless clearly erroneous[,] the WCAB’s interpretation\nof the workers’ compensation laws is entitled to great weight.” (Genlyte Group., LLC v.\nWorkers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2244919\"><a href=\"/opinion/2244919/genlyte-group-llc-v-wcab/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 714.) Nevertheless, issues of\nstatutory interpretation and questions of law are subject to our independent review, and\nwe need not defer to the WCAB’s legal determinations where they are contrary to the\nplain meaning of the statute or prevailing case law. (See ibid.)\n       As all parties acknowledge, the resolution of this case turns on Ogilvie. In that\ncase, the WCAB found a workers’ compensation applicant could rebut his diminished\nfuture earning capacity adjustment by proposing an alternative earning capacity, so long\nas the applicant used a numeric formula based on empirical data and findings. (Ogilvie,\nsupra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1268.) After granting a petition for review, our colleagues\nin Division 3 found the WCAB had erred because, under the 2004 amendments to the\nworkers’ compensation scheme, the statutory rating schedule “is to be ‘prima facie\nevidence of the percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to each injury covered\nby the schedule’ (§ 4660, subd. (c)).” (Id. at p. 1272.) There was “no indication some\nother measure may be substituted for the earning capacity component in order to arrive\nat an overall rating most suitable for a particular employee.” (Ibid.) The court suggested\nthe WCAB’s approach was contrary to the purpose of the amendments, which was to\n“ ‘alleviate a perceived crisis in skyrocketing workers’ compensation costs’ ” and to\n“ ‘promote consistency, uniformity, and objectivity.’ ” (Id. at pp. 1270–1273.)\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       While the statutory Schedule was presumptively correct, the court held it could be\nrebutted using methods recognized prior to the 2004 amendments. (Ogilvie, supra, 197\nCal.App.4th at p. 1273.) Nothing in the statutory text or legislative history indicated the\nLegislature intended “ ‘to overthrow [these] long-established principles of law.’ ” (Ibid.)\nThe court identified three such methods. (Id. at p. 1277.) First, an employee could rebut\nthe scheduled rating by showing a factual error in the application of a formula or the\npreparation of the schedule. (Id. at p. 1273.) Second, the employee could show “the\ninjury . . . impairs his or her rehabilitation, and for that reason, the employee’s diminished\nfuture earning capacity is greater than reflected in the employee’s scheduled rating.” (Id.\nat p. 1274.) Third, in certain rare cases, an employee may show the amalgamation of data\nused to arrive at a diminished future earning capacity do not capture the severity of all of\nthe medical complications of an employee’s work-related injury. (Id. at p. 1275.)\n       The court derived the second method from our Supreme Court’s opinion in\nLeBoeuf, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1142901\"><a href=\"/opinion/1142901/leboeuf-v-workerscomp-appeals-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1274.) In\nLeBoeuf, the claimant, who had been awarded 60 percent permanent disability, moved to\nreopen his compensation proceedings based on the Bureau of Rehabilitation’s finding\nthat he would be unable to return to suitable gainful employment through vocational\nrehabilitation services. (LeBoeuf, supra, 34 Cal.3d at pp. 238–240.) The WCJ and\nWCAB denied his request. (Id. at p. 240.) The court found this was error, stating: “Just\nas retraining may increase a worker’s ability to compete in the labor market, a\ndetermination that he or she cannot be retrained for any suitable gainful employment may\nadversely affect a worker’s overall ability to compete. Accordingly, that factor should be\nconsidered in any determination of a permanent disability rating.” (Id. at p. 243.)\n       In Ogilvie, the court concluded the LeBoeuf approach was limited to cases “where\nthe employee’s diminished future earnings are directly attributable to the employee’s\nwork-related injury, and not due to nonindustrial factors such as general economic\nconditions, illiteracy, proficiency in speaking English, or an employee’s lack of\neducation.” (Ogilvie, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1275.) “This application of LeBoeuf\nhews most closely to an employer’s responsibility . . . to ‘compensate only for such\n\n\n                                             10\n\fdisability or need for treatment as is occupationally related.’ ” (Ibid.) In support, the\ncourt cited to a number of workers’ compensation cases dealing with an employee’s\nability to rehabilitate. (Ibid.) In most of these cases, the WCAB denied claimants’\npetitions for reconsideration because their inability to benefit from rehabilitation was due,\nat least in part, to pre-existing nonindustrial factors that had nothing to with their\ninjuries.5\n       Dahl’s attempt to rebut her disability rating bears little resemblance to any of the\nmethods described in Ogilvie, including the rebuttal method derived from LeBoeuf. Dahl\ndid not explain how her injury prevented her from participating in vocational\nrehabilitation. In fact, Dahl’s own vocational expert conceded that she was a good\nrehabilitation candidate and also stated a discussion of vocational rehabilitation was\n“irrelevant.” The gravamen of Dahl’s rebuttal is that her expert’s analysis of the earning\ncapacity—based on the earnings loss of a group of individuals that the expert identified\nas more similarly situated to Dahl than the group identified in the Schedule for someone\nwith her characteristics—is superior to the method and rating called for by the statute.\nThis approach is at odds with Ogilvie, which rejected a similar attempt to simply\nsubstitute a vocational expert’s or judge- or board-preferred methodology for the\nstatutorily prescribed rating system. Ogilvie signaled that it would be a rare case in\nwhich an applicant or employer could rebut a scheduled rating. Yet under the WCAB’s\napproach here, claimants would be permitted to rebut their scheduled rating in virtually\nall cases where an expert can provide a statistical analysis of a group of individuals he or\nshe claims is more similarly situated to the applicant than that identified in the Schedule.\nAs amicus curiae California Association of Joint Powers Authorities points out, the\n\n\n\n       5\n         See James v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals Bd. (1986) 51 Cal.Comp.Cases\n45 (writ denied); Espinoza v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals Bd. (1994) 59\nCal.Comp.Cases 753 (writ denied); Southern v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals Bd.\n(1997) 62 Cal.Comp.Cases 719 (writ denied); Avei v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals\nBd. (2004) 69 Cal.Comp.Cases 434 (writ denied); Linam v. Workers’ Compensation\nAppeals Bd. (2007) 72 Cal.Comp.Cases 332 (writ denied).\n\n\n                                              11\n\f“control groups of ‘similarly situated’ employees” set forth in the Schedule “provide[] the\n‘consistency, uniformity and objectivity’ ” that the Legislature sought to promote.\n       The first step in any LeBoeuf analysis is to determine whether a work-related\ninjury precludes the claimant from taking advantage of vocational rehabilitation and\nparticipating in the labor force. This necessarily requires an individualized approach.\nFor example, in Gottschalks v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board (2003) 68\nCal.Comp.Cases 1714, 1716 (writ denied), one of the compensation cases cited in\nOgilvie, the WCAB denied an employer’s petition for reconsideration of a 100-percent\ndisability rating where Oxycontin, a medication used to treat the claimant’s industrial\ninjury, had a “ ‘severe [e]ffect’ ” on the claimant’s ability to work. The focus was on the\nlimitations flowing from the claimant’s particular condition, not the earning potential of\nsimilarly situated individuals who might be subject to different limitations. It is this\nindividualized assessment of whether industrial factors preclude the employee’s\nrehabilitation that Ogilvie approved as a method for rebutting the Schedule. The Ogilvie\ncourt did not sanction rebuttal of the statutory Schedule by a competing empirical\nmethodology—no matter how superior the applicant and her expert claim it may be.\n       In this case, the County presented evidence Dahl’s injury did not prevent her from\ntaking advantage of retraining opportunities or finding another job. Dahl’s medical\nevaluator has not provided any formal work restrictions. Moreover, Cohen, the County’s\nvocational expert, concluded Dahl had the ability to work in selected occupations in the\nopen labor mark, including sedentary, semi-sedentary and light work positions. Cohen\nalso found Dahl possessed above-average problem solving, reading, spelling and\narithmetic skills, commensurate with the college degree she earned in 2003, indicating\nshe has the cognitive ability to perform any of the occupations for which her college\ndegree prepared her.\n       Malmuth, Dahl’s vocational expert, did not present contrary evidence. He testified\nDahl had at least some earning capacity, and concluded there was no medical evidence\nshe could not work eight hours per day. When asked if Dahl was an ideal candidate for\nrehabilitation, Malmuth responded that, with some training, including voice recognition\n\n\n                                             12\n\fand other things, “she would be helped.” Malmuth further testified Dahl performed “very\nwell” on testing, and that her college education could increase her earning capacity.\nMalmuth also opined that, even with her injury, Dahl could perform certain jobs without\nretraining.\n       Nevertheless, Malmuth concluded Dahl is not amenable to rehabilitation because\nit would not restore her, or a similarly situated worker, to full pre-injury earning capacity.\nBut this is precisely what the statutory formula for diminished future earning capacity\nfactor is intended to capture. Most work-related injuries that qualify an employee for\nworkers’ compensation benefits reduce earning potential to some degree. Thus, allowing\na claimant to rebut his or her permanent disability rating through a showing of some\ndiminished future earning capacity would render the statutory formula virtually\nmeaningless. Nothing in Ogilvie or any of the case law on which it relies suggests\ndeparture from the statutory rating system is permissible whenever an employee cannot\nbe returned to his or her pre-injury earning capacity.\n       Based on this record, there was no basis for the WCJ or the WCAB to conclude\nDahl had rebutted her scheduled diminished future earning capacity by showing she was\nnot amenable to vocational rehabilitation. In fact, it appears no such finding was made in\nthe proceedings below. The WCJ initially held Dahl could not rebut her scheduled rating\nbecause she failed to show her injury resulted in a total loss of earning capacity. On a\npetition for review, the WCAB disagreed that rebuttal based on a claimant’s ability to\nrehabilitate was only available in cases involving 100-percent total permanent disability.\nThe WCAB accepted Dahl’s contention “that a LeBoeuf type of analysis may be properly\napplied . . . when it is shown that the injury impairs the employee’s rehabilitation, as in\nthis case.” However, the WCAB did not refer to any specific evidence that would\nsupport such a finding as to Dahl’s rehabilitation prospects. On remand, the WCJ held\nthe WCAB’s decision after reconsideration conclusively established Dahl had rebutted\nthe scheduled rating but did not identify any evidence showing Dahl’s injuries precluded\nrehabilitation. We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f       The WCJ relied on the language, which we have italicized, from the following\nparagraph of the WCAB decision: “Application of a LeBoeuf type of analysis in cases of\npartial permanent disability requires expert opinion on the effect of the injury’s\nimpairment on the worker’s amenability to rehabilitation and the effect of that on DFEC.\nSuch an analysis can be done even where there is less than total permanent disability, as\nin this case where the employee has rebutted the PDRS by showing that she will have a\ngreater DFEC than reflected in the PDRS rating.” This language, while less than clear,\ndoes not reflect a finding that Dahl had already met her burden; it indicates only that the\nWCAB viewed it as permissible for her to meet her burden without claiming to be 100-\npercent disabled. Indeed, as indicated above, the WCAB remanded for further\ndevelopment of the record to ascertain whether Dahl’s rebuttal showing supported a\nfinding of disability greater than her scheduled disability—i.e., whether she had satisfied\nthe second method approved in Ogilvie for rebutting her scheduled rating. (See Ogilvie,\nsupra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1277 [“we conclude that an employee may challenge the\npresumptive scheduled percentage of permanent disability prescribed to an injury . . . by\ndemonstrating that due to industrial injury the employee is not amenable to rehabilitation\nand therefore has suffered a greater loss of future earning capacity than reflected in the\nscheduled rating”].) The WCAB thus remanded the case not because it concluded Dahl\nhad already made that showing, but to allow the WCJ to determine whether she had done\nso.\n       We are skeptical of WCAB’s conclusion that an employee may invoke the second\nOgilvie rebuttal method where the inability to rehabilitate results in less than a 100-\npercent permanent disability.6 However, we need not decide this issue since the County\n\n\n       6\n         For the same reason as the rule advocated by Malmuth allowing rebuttal\nwhenever an employee shows she cannot be expected to earn the same as she did prior to\ninjury, a partial impairment rule would allow for rebuttal in a wide swath of cases. Many\ninjured employees cannot return to the precise position they held before their injury or to\nan equally remunerative one. Ogilvie does not appear to contemplate rebuttal of the\nscheduled rating in this circumstance, since the Schedule’s formula for determining\ndiminished future earning capacity takes into account such limitations. Notably, the two\n\n                                             14\n\fdid not seek a writ from the WCAB decision adopting the partial impairment rule. In any\nevent, even if an employee’s ability to rehabilitate need only be impaired (and not\neliminated) in order to rebut the schedule, Dahl failed to make such a showing here. As\ndiscussed above, both Dahl and the County’s rehabilitation experts agreed Dahl was a\ngood rehabilitation candidate, and the evidence suggests she can increase her earning\npotential through retraining. There is no evidence that the injury even limited her\nrehabilitation prospects.\n       Dahl argues she successfully rebutted the scheduled rating because the state\nceased providing a vocational rehabilitation program for injured workers as of January 1,\n2003. We disagree. As the County points out, section 4658.5 does provide for workers’\ncompensation vouchers that may be used to pay tuition and other expenses required for\nretraining. Specifically, the statute provides that an injured employee who does not\nreturn to work for the employer within 60 days of the termination of temporary disability\nshall be eligible for a voucher for education-related retraining or skill enhancement at a\nstate-approved or accredited school. (§ 4658.5, subd. (b).) For disability awards between\n50 and 99 percent, the voucher may be up to $10,000. (§ 4658.5, subd. (b)(4).) The\napplicant in Ogilvie was presumably eligible for identical benefits, as this provision was\nlast amended in 2003. Moreover, Ogilvie holds claimants must show they are not\namenable to rehabilitation due to their industrial injury, not due to extraneous factors,\nsuch as the cessation of certain state-sponsored rehabilitation benefits. (Ogilvie, supra,\n197 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1274–1275.) To hold otherwise would mean every employee\ncould now rebut their scheduled rating using a LeBoeuf analysis, turning a limited\nexception into the general rule. There is no indication Ogilvie intended the second\nrebuttal method to be so broad and all-encompassing.\n\n\n\n\ncases cited by Ogilvie which found claimants were unable to rehabilitate involved injuries\nthat rendered the claimants unable to return to any type of gainful employment. (See\nLeBoeuf, supra, 34 Cal.3d at pp. 239–240; Gottschalks v. Workers’ Compensation\nAppeals Bd., supra, 68 Cal.Comp.Cases at p.1716.)\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       In sum, we find WCAB’s approach in this case flies in the face of Ogilvie and the\n2004 amendments to the workers’ compensation scheme. Under the 2004 amendments, a\nclaimant’s scheduled rating is presumptively correct. Ogilvie confirmed the Legislature\nmeant what it said, and that claimants may not rebut their disability rating merely by\noffering an alternative calculation of their diminished future earning capacity. While\nOgilvie found the 2004 amendments did not overthrow certain long-held approaches to\ncalculating earning capacity, it clearly did not intend those approaches to be construed so\nbroadly as to return us to the ad-hoc decision making that prevailed prior to 2004.\nFollowing the WCAB’s approach in this case would do just that. Claimants could rebut\ntheir presumptively correct disability rating merely by presenting an analysis that shows a\ngreater diminished future earning capacity than that determined by applying the\nSchedule. As Ogilvie makes clear, this approach is no longer permissible.\n                                     DISPOSITION\n       The decision of the WCAB is annulled. We remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f                   STEWART, J.\n\n\n\nWe concur.\n\n\n\n\nKLINE, P.J.\n\n\n\n\nRICHMAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n              17\n\fContra Costa County v.
