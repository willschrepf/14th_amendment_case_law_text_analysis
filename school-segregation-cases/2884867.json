ARNOLD, LAY, and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.\n                           ___________\n\nRICHARD S. ARNOLD, Circuit Judge.\n\n      This case arises under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),\n20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487 (1994) (amended 1997). A state hearing officer ordered the\nappellant, Independent School District No. 284 (\"the District\"), to pay the costs of a\nresidential education and treatment program for A.C., a student with a variety of\nemotional and behavioral problems. The District brought this action in federal district\ncourt pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2), and obtained a ruling that the residential\nplacement was not educationally necessary. A.C. appeals, and we reverse.\n\f                                           I.\n\n        When A.C. moved into the District, she was 15 years old. Her previous school\ndistrict had provided her with special-education services for emotional and behavioral\ndisorders and had developed an Individualized Education Program (IEP) which\nassigned her to a special, \"self-contained\" classroom. A.C.'s school-related problems\nincluded classroom disruption, profanity, insubordination, and truancy. School officials\nin her old district had tried to deal with these problems by allowing her to take her\nclasses at an off-campus day center for troubled kids. That didn't work: she would\neither leave the center or not show up at all. Outside of school, she used alcohol and\nillegal drugs, was sexually promiscuous, repeatedly ran away from home, was thought\nto have forged checks, and was hospitalized three times for threatening or attempting\nsuicide. Her mother, C.C., tried to get the county social services department to pay for\na residential treatment program. The county offered placement in a juvenile\ncorrectional facility, which C.C. declined. After that, C.C. stopped telling the county\nabout A.C.'s absences from home. C.C. also tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain a court\norder placing A.C. in a non-correctional residential treatment center.\n\n       When District No. 284 first took on the responsibility of educating A.C., it tried\nto implement the IEP from her old district. It placed her in one of two self-contained\nclassrooms for students with emotional and behavioral problems. On her third day of\nattendance, A.C. was suspended for behaving inappropriately, cursing, and disobeying\na school authority. The school returned A.C. to the self-contained classroom while it\nreviewed her placement. After a few days, she stopped coming to class. Meanwhile,\nC.C. resumed trying to obtain a court-ordered residential placement. A.C.'s current\nhigh school's social worker, her previous school's staff psychologist, and her IEP\nmanager wrote letters to the court. All three agreed that A.C.'s behavior was interfering\nwith her academic progress. The psychologist and the IEP manager also noted that past\neducational strategies had been ineffective, and said that A.C. needed a highly\nstructured program that would address her behavioral and psychological problems. The\n\n                                           -2-\n\fcourt refused to order a residential placement. Instead, it ordered A.C. to attend\nschool, an order with which she did not comply.\n\n       C.C. continued to pursue a residential placement. She had several meetings with\nA.C.'s IEP team and provided the District with the information presented to the juvenile\ncourt. As an interim measure, the District provided homebound instruction services,\nof which A.C. made sporadic use. For the longer term, the District said that it would\neither return A.C. to the self-contained classroom or enroll her in a day treatment\nprogram on the campus of the University of Minnesota, to which she could travel by\ncity bus. C.C. was not satisfied with these choices. She asked that A.C. be enrolled\nat Rocky Mountain Academy (RMA), a residential treatment center in Idaho, at District\nexpense. The District agreed to pay the \"educational\" costs of this placement, but not\ncosts related to therapy or lodging. In monetary terms, that meant the District would\npay a little more than one third of the $55,000 annual attendance charge for RMA.\n\n       With negotiations at an impasse, the District agreed to an Independent\nEducational Evaluation (IEE) of A.C. by a neuropsychologist on the faculty of the\nUniversity of Minnesota. The evaluator found no major attention problems,\nhyperactivity, learning disabilities, deficiencies of intelligence or memory, or the like.\nInstead, she traced A.C.'s educational problems to \"psychological difficulties\" such as\nher \"oppositionality, manipulative tendencies, and strong need for control and\nattention.\" On the basis of these observations, A.C. was diagnosed with \"conduct\ndisorder,\" but the evaluator explained in her deposition that this diagnostic category\nwas used mainly because the patient was still too young to be diagnosed with a\npersonality disorder. She said that a diagnosis of antisocial or narcissistic personality\ndisorder would probably be appropriate when A.C. reaches the age at which those\ncategories are applied. The evaluator strongly recommended that A.C. be placed in a\nsecure facility, largely to prevent truancy, and predicted that, after a course of\ntreatment, A.C. would probably be able to return to the classroom. According to\nfindings in the administrative record, the evaluator\n\n                                           -3-\n\f      considered a day treatment placement, and does not believe it will be\n      effective as the Student will not attend. While a day treatment facility\n      could provide educational services, the services would be ineffective . . .\n      due to the nature and extent of her emotional and behavioral disorder.\n\nFindings of Fact, Conclusions, and Decision of Independent Hearing Officer (hereafter\nIHO Decision) at 11. The state review officer found that the \"IEE Evaluator concluded\nunequivocally that it is necessary for Student to be in a secure residential treatment\nfacility in order for Student to gain educational benefit.\" Findings of Fact, Conclusions\nof Law, and Decision of Hearing Review Officer (hereafter HRO Decision) at 9. The\nprivate psychologist who has been treating A.C. since 1996 believes that she exhibits\nborderline personality development and may have dysthymia, a form of depression.\n\n        The controversy next went to an administrative hearing in the Minnesota\nDepartment of Children, Families, and Learning. The Independent Hearing Officer\nordered the District to provide 100 hours of compensatory education and to convene\nan IEP meeting for the purpose of \"locat[ing] an appropriate residential placement to\nmeet the Students [sic] emotional, behavioral and educational needs.\" IHO Decision\nat 21. The Hearing Review Officer affirmed. The District then commenced this action,\nas permitted by 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A). The District Court affirmed the award of\ncompensatory education, a decision from which the District does not appeal. As to the\nresidential placement, the District Court reversed. It noted that the IEE evaluator had\ntestified that the day program proposed in the District's IEP \" 'would educationally meet\nher needs, . . . from the standpoint of the individualized kind of work that she needs to\nmeet her educational needs.' \" Order at 5, quoting Hearing Transcript at 621. Because\nthe Court found nothing in the record to suggest that A.C.'s behavioral problems\nrendered her unable to attend the day program, it concluded that a residential\nplacement was not necessary to address her educational needs.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f                                           II.\n\n       The IDEA \"was intended to ensure that children with disabilities receive an\neducation that is both appropriate and free.\" Florence County School District 4 v.\nCarter, 510 U.S. 7, 13 (1993). As defined in the Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1401(8), a \"free\nappropriate public education\" includes both instruction, which must be specially\ndesigned to suit the needs of the disabled child, see 20 U.S.C. § 1401(25), and \"related\nservices,\" including \"such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services .\n. . as may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special\neducation.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1401(22). It is undisputed that A.C. is a \"child with a\ndisability\" within the meaning of 20 U.S.C. § 1401(3)(A).\n\n       The purpose of this action is to determine whether a residential placement is part\nof the special education and related services the District must provide in order to give\nA.C. a free appropriate public education. The Supreme Court held in Board of Ed. of\nthe Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester County v. Rowley, 458 U.S.\n176, 206-07 (1982), that\n\n      a court's inquiry in suits brought under [§ 1415(i)(2)] is twofold. First,\n      has the State complied with the procedures set forth in the Act? And\n      second, is the individualized educational program developed through the\n      Act's procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive\n      educational benefits? If these requirements are met, the State has\n      complied with the obligations imposed by Congress and the courts can\n      require no more.\n\n\nId. at 206-07 (footnotes omitted). The parties do not dispute that the procedural\nrequirements of the IDEA were met here. The question before us, therefore, is whether\nthe District's IEP is reasonably calculated to provide A.C. with educational benefits.\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fThis is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo. Strawn v. Missouri\nState Board of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 958 (8th Cir. 2000).\n\n       That our review of the District Court is de novo does not mean that we write on\nan entirely clean slate. We must afford \"due weight\" to the outcome of the state\nadministrative proceedings, giving particular consideration to state officials' educational\njudgments. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206; see also Strawn, 210 F.3d at 958; E.S. v.\nIndependent School District No. 196, 135 F.3d 566, 569 (8th Cir. 1998) (a reviewing\ncourt should \"resist[] any impulse to 'substitute [its] own notions of sound educational\npolicy for those of the school authorities' \") (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206). In\nsome cases, however, a court may have good legal reasons for rejecting a state's\ndecision. For example, the IDEA expresses the will of Congress that disabled students\nbe educated with non-disabled students \"[t]o the maximum extent appropriate.\" 20\nU.S.C. § 1412(5)(A). We have reversed a state decision concerning an IEP where no\neducational reasons were given for placing a disabled child in a separate learning\nenvironment. See Independent School District No. 283 v. S.D., 88 F.3d 556, 561-62\n(8th Cir. 1996) (district court correctly reversed hearing review officer's separate\nplacement, where both the school district and the first-tier state hearing officer judged\na mainstream placement appropriate, and the review officer gave no educational reason\nfor disagreeing with them).\n\n      Despite the statutory preference for mainstream placements, the IDEA\nrecognizes that some disabled students need full-time care in order to receive\neducational benefit. It defines \"special education\" to include \"instruction conducted\n. . . in hospitals and institutions,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1401(25); cf. 34 C.F.R. 300.26 (2000).\nRegulations promulgated under the statute by the United States Department of\nEducation require that, \"[i]f placement in a public or private residential program is\nnecessary to provide special education and related services to a child with a disability,\nthe program, including non-medical care and room and board, must be at no cost to the\nparents of the child.\" 34 C.F.R. § 300.302 (2000). The reason for this rule is\n\n                                            -6-\n\fstraightforward: if a residential placement is educationally necessary because of a\nstudent's disability, and the state does not provide it, then the state's IEP is not\n\"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits\" as required\nby Rowley. Thus, the IDEA requires that a state pay for a disabled student's residential\nplacement if the student, because of his or her disability, cannot reasonably be\nanticipated to benefit from instruction without such a placement. See Mrs. B. v.\nMilford Board of Ed., 103 F.3d 1114, 1122 (2d Cir. 1997) (asking \"whether the child\nrequires the residential program to receive educational benefit\"); McKenzie v. Smith,\n771 F.2d 1527, 1534 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (asking \" 'whether full-time placement may be\nconsidered necessary for educational purposes, or whether the residential placement\nis a response to medical, social or emotional problems that are segregable from the\nlearning process.' \") (quoting Kruelle v. New Castle County School Dist., 642 F.2d\n687, 693 (3d Cir. 1981)).\n\n                                            III.\n\n       The District first argues that the case is moot, because A.C. has apparently\nmoved to another district and has conceded that the District is not responsible for\nprospective relief. In Thompson v. Bd. of the Special School Dist. No. 1, 144 F.3d\n574, 579 (8th Cir. 1998), we held that a student's IDEA claim was moot because his\nold district was not responsible for providing him a due-process hearing, which he\nrequested only after he had left the district to attend another school. Here, however,\nA.C.'s due-process hearing is over. A.C.'s claim in this case concerns obligations the\nDistrict allegedly had in the past and failed to meet. The remedy sought is\ncompensatory. It does not matter whether the District has any present or future\nobligation to develop a new IEP for her or to give her further hearings. If A.C. or her\nmother had paid the costs of a private placement at the time, and then sued the District\nfor reimbursement, the claim would not be moot. See Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills\nSchool Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 4 n.3 (1993). We think that the same result should obtain\nhere. In either case, the claim is that the statute obligated the school district to pay for\n\n                                            -7-\n\fthe placement during the time when it was responsible for the student's education.\nAssuming that A.C.'s claim has merit, it would not make sense to deny her a remedy\nagainst the District just because her parent did not or could not pay for the placement\nthat the District denied her.\n\n      We therefore turn to the merits. The District Court held that\n\n      the record . . . makes it clear that residential placement is necessary only\n      to treat Plaintiff's social and emotional problems, not for educational\n      purposes. . . . Student's problems, and the risks to which she is exposed,\n      are social and emotional in nature. In fact, the IEE Evaluator specifically\n      noted that Student has no neurological deficits which interfere with her\n      learning and is of average intelligence, with no symptoms of ADD or\n      ADHD, and found that day treatment would meet Plaintiff's educational\n      needs. [Citation omitted.] While one manifestation of A.C.'s emotional\n      behavioral disorder is her unwillingness to attend school or comply with\n      the requirements of ISD 284's IEP, there is nothing in the record to\n      support a conclusion that there is anything about A.C.'s disorder which\n      renders her unable to attend school or unable to comply with the IEP.\n\nOrder of Magistrate Judge at 10. There is much in this assessment with which we\nagree. Certainly no one disputes that A.C. has social and emotional problems, and the\nrecord would not support a finding that she has learning disabilities. We also think it\nunlikely that Congress meant for the IDEA to require states to provide a home away\nfrom home for students who simply make bad choices, even if those choices cause them\nto fail in school. See, e.g., Springer v. Fairfax County School Bd., 134 F.3d 659, 664\n(4th Cir. 1998) (holding that student diagnosed with \"conduct disorder\" did not have\nan emotional disturbance but was merely \"socially maladjusted\" under the precursor to\n34 C.F.R. § 300.7(c)(4)(ii) (2000)).\n\n     We do not believe, however, that the analysis can be limited to a stark distinction\nbetween unwillingness and inability to behave appropriately. There is a grey area\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fbetween normal, voluntary conduct and involuntary physiological response, and that\narea is where Congress has chosen to locate behavioral problems such as A.C.'s. The\nIDEA clearly includes \"emotional disturbance[s]\" as disabilities. 20 U.S.C. §\n1401(3)(A). According to the Department of Education, an emotional disturbance is\n\n       [A] condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteristics over\n       a long period of time and to a marked degree that adversely affects a\n       child's educational performance:\n\n             (A) An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual,\n       sensory, or health factors.\n\n              (B) An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal\n       relationships with peers and teachers.\n\n             (C) Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal\n       circumstances.\n\n              (D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.\n\n             (E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated\n       with personal or school problems.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.7(c)(4)(i). Read naturally and as a whole, the law and the regulations\nidentify a class of children who are disabled only in the sense that their abnormal\nemotional conditions prevent them from choosing normal responses to normal\nsituations. See Honig, California Superintendent of Public Instruction v. Doe, 484 U.S.\n305, 320 (1988) (stating, of an emotionally disturbed student, that \"[i]t is [the student's]\nvery inability to conform his conduct to socially acceptable norms that renders him\n'handicapped' within the meaning of the EHA\").\n\n       Consistently with this reading, a child whose disabling condition manifests itself\nin disruptive conduct is exempted, to a degree, from normal disciplinary procedures.\n\n                                            -9-\n\fWhile Education Department regulations do permit children with disabilities to be\nsuspended from school under some circumstances, see 34 C.F.R. § 300.520(a)(1), the\nDepartment also instructs schools that suspension or expulsion is not normally\nappropriate as a first-line response to behavior problems resulting from a student's\ndisability, even if the conduct in question violates school rules. See 34 C.F.R. Part 300,\nApp. A, Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and Other Selected Implementation\nIssues, VI.38 (2000). Instead, the student's IEP team should address the behavior in\nthe first instance, using suspension and other disciplinary measures only if appropriate\nin the context of the IEP. Id. This does not mean that the IDEA has obliterated the\nconcept of personal responsibility, or that children with disabilities cannot be punished\nfor simple misbehavior. It merely reflects the Department's judgment that sometimes,\nwith certain children, what looks like simple misbehavior is actually a more\ncomplicated problem whose remedy should be integrated into the child's overall\nprogram of special education.\n\n       The preponderance of the evidence in the record before us supports the state's\nconclusion that A.C.'s truancy and classroom disruption belong in this category.\nAlthough the IEE evaluator reported that A.C. \"does not have any significant\nneurocognitive impairment,\" Summary of Evaluation at 6, cf. Hearing Transcript at 623,\nshe also found A.C. to be \"very impaired\" with respect to her disabling condition, and\neven repeated the phrase for emphasis. Hearing Transcript at 653. Asked to clarify,\nshe said that the latter finding related to \"[A.C.'s] conduct disorder and her total\nfunctional impairment. . . . [H]er ability to operate on a day-to-day basis is impaired.\nShe is not impaired cognitively.\" Id. at 662. Both the IEE evaluator and A.C.'s treating\npsychologist regard her lack of self-control as a settled disorder traceable to early\nexperiences. See Summary of Evaluation at 3-4 (noting that A.C.'s treating\npsychologist \"feels that [A.C.] has suffered significant trauma,\" stating that \"[i]t is clear\nfrom the interviews with [A.C.] and her mother that [A.C.] has experienced a\nsignificant emotional turmoil and that this has had a profound effect on her personality\ndevelopment,\" and tracing A.C.'s excessive need for control to her \" 'parental'\n\n                                            -10-\n\fexperiences as a young child\"). Perhaps these facts do not show that A.C. is irresistibly\ncompelled to cut school, but they do tend to show that her truancy and defiance of\nauthority result from a genuine emotional disturbance rather than from a purely moral\nfailing. The school district, which has the burden of proof here, see E.S., 135 F.3d at\n569, has presented no evidence to the contrary.\n\n       The District Court accurately described A.C.'s problems as \"social and emotional\nin nature,\" and concluded from this that they were \"separable from the learning\nprocess.\" Order of Magistrate Judge at 9-10. That conclusion does not follow. Apart\nfrom other reasons, the mere fact that Congress regards emotional disturbances as\ndisabilities entitling a child to special education shows that, at least in Congress's\njudgment, social and emotional problems are not ipso facto separable from the learning\nprocess. Nor do we agree with the Seventh Circuit that a problem resulting from a\ndisability is separable from the learning process if the problem is \"not primarily\neducational.\" Dale M. v. Bd. of Ed. of Bradley-Bourbonnais High School Dist. No.\n307, 237 F.3d 813, 817 (7th Cir. 2001). If the problem prevents a disabled child from\nreceiving educational benefit, then it should not matter that the problem is not cognitive\nin nature or that it causes the child even more trouble outside the classroom than within\nit. What should control our decision is not whether the problem itself is \"educational\"\nor \"non-educational,\" but whether it needs to be addressed in order for the child to\nlearn.\n\n       Moreover, the record here does not permit the conclusion that A.C.'s behavior\nproblems are separable from the learning process. The IEE evaluator made quite clear\nher judgment that A.C. will not receive educational benefit unless her emotional and\nbehavioral problems are dealt with. The school psychologist from her old district,\ndrawing on over two years of that district's experiences with her, said that \"[f]or any\nplacement to be successful, there will need to be the ability to exert sufficient control\nwhile providing a therapeutic approach.\" Letter of 9/22/98 at 2, Joint Appendix (JA)\nat 355. An assessment by District 284 itself, completed after A.C.'s brief period of\n\n                                          -11-\n\fattendance there, says that A.C.'s behavioral and emotional problems must be\naddressed if she is to succeed academically. Even the IEP at issue here states that\nA.C.'s \"[g]rades and credit completion suffer as a result of her explosive and\noppositional behavior,\" and that \"[s]he needs a high degree of structure and support,\nincluding immediate feedback with her behavior in order to be successful.\" IEP of\n3/19/99 at 2, JA at 357. This is not a case where the correction of behavioral and\nemotional problems is merely desirable in order to improve a student's performance:\nat the time of her hearing, which occurred at the end of her tenth-grade year, A.C. had\ncompleted only nine of the 32 credits required for graduation, although she is of\naverage intelligence and has no learning disability. Both hearing officers found that\nA.C.'s truancy and disruptiveness had substantially prevented her from receiving\neducational benefit. We see nothing in the record that would support a finding to the\ncontrary.\n\n                                           IV.\n\n       The remaining question, then, is whether A.C. can reasonably be expected to\nmake academic progress outside of a residential program. If we regard this as an\neducational question, there appears to be a consensus in the negative. A.C.'s treating\npsychologist, her IEE evaluator, her old district's school psychologist, her mother, and\nboth state hearing officers all have reached the conclusion that a residential placement\nis necessary in order for A.C. to get an education. It is true that the evaluator testified\nthat a day program like the one recommended by the District \"would educationally\nmeet [A.C.'s] needs,\" Hearing Transcript at 621, but it is clear from the context that this\nremark referred only to the appropriateness of the kind of instruction provided and not\nto the \"related services.\" Of all the educators whose views of the matter appear in the\nrecord, the only one that does not recommend a residential placement is the school\ndistrict that is being asked to pay for it. This tends to show that the District's\nrecommended placement is not reasonably calculated to enable A.C. to receive\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\feducational benefit, or, put otherwise, that a residential placement is necessary to\nprovide A.C. with special education and related services.\n\n       The District characterizes A.C.'s need for a residential placement as a need for\nconfinement, and argues that confinement is not a \"related service\" it is required to\nprovide. This view has some justification. The IEE evaluator testified that\n\n      the real issue is, you know, how can you get her into an educational\n      setting. When she is with her tutor and if she shows up for her tutoring,\n      she does her work and she is able to do her work. There is no problem\n      in doing her work. It is a question, really, of getting her and a teacher in\n      the same room and she getting to that place and sitting down with that\n      teacher.\n\nHearing Transcript at 622-23. In response to questioning by the District's attorney, she\nfurther stated that her recommendation of a residential placement was based on her\njudgment that A.C.\n\n      will leave any treatment facility. She will run from any treatment facility\n      that is not [sic] where she's not confined in some way, because,\n      ultimately, any treatment facility is going to ask her to do things that she\n      does not want to do. And that is why she cannot be educated in a normal\n      way, because she is not – she just will not attend.\n\nId. at 614. The evaluator also emphasized the benefit to A.C. of being prevented from\nusing drugs and from engaging in promiscuous sex. Id. at 618-19, 623.\n\n       These statements should not be viewed in isolation, however. Taken as a whole,\nthe IEE evaluator's testimony suggests that a residential placement is necessary in order\nto correct A.C.'s behavioral and emotional problems, not just to keep her off the streets\nor to force her to sit down with a tutor. Although tests reveal A.C. to be a shrewd\nproblem solver, she fails to exercise good judgment in her dealings with others because\n\n                                          -13-\n\fshe lacks empathy, defined as \"the ability . . . to gauge behavior according to what\nother people want from you.\" Hearing Transcript at 590. This deficiency was\nconfirmed, for example, by her Rorschach inkblot test, in which she identified none of\nthe shapes as human. Id. at 592. When asked to give a prognosis for A.C., the\nevaluator said, \"I think she can improve . . . otherwise, you would just put her in a\nconfined situation without any treatment. Obviously, I think there can be\nimprovement.\" She testified that neither medication, individual psychotherapy, nor\nfamily therapy was likely to do much good, but that the residential aspect of a secure\nfacility would probably have therapeutic benefit:\n\n      the fact is that at a residential treatment program, . . . the environment is\n      the therapy. And, you know, I think that it's a sort of a relearning process\n      that she needs. I mean, she needs socialization. . . . [S]he's very\n      narcissistic and does not have this sort of sense of what the other feels or\n      what the other is responding to.\n\n             And so, you know, I think in a setting where that kind of emphasis\n      is placed in terms of the interactions with others – you know, sometimes\n      peer pressure can be very effective with individuals like her. If everybody\n      in her unit is pressuring her to behave in a certain way or her counselor is\n      pressuring her to behave and she has to alter her behavior under those\n      conditions. So that's what an environment, you know, is going to do for\n      her. Psychotherapy is not going to do that.\n\nId. at 617-18. It would be one-sided, therefore, to say that mere confinement was the\nevaluator's reason for recommending a residential placement. An independent and\nsufficient reason for that recommendation was to provide treatment for a psychological\nproblem that has prevented A.C. from making acceptable academic progress.\n\n\n\n      The District also argues that the IDEA's preference for mainstream placements\ncounsels against placing A.C. in a residential facility. Although our cases have placed\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\femphasis on this statutory preference, see, e.g., Springdale School Dist. No. 50 of\nWashington County v. Grace, 693 F.2d 41, 43 (8th Cir. 1982) (classing the preference\namong the \"primary directives\" of the IDEA); S.D., 88 F.3d at 561 (calling it a \"strong\npreference\"), we do not believe it is implicated here. The statute requires\nmainstreaming only \"to the maximum extent appropriate,\" not to the maximum extent\npossible. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(5)(A). As the Supreme Court explained in School\nCommittee of the Town of Burlington, Mass. v. Dept. of Ed. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359,\n373 (1985), in crafting this language \"Congress was concerned about the apparently\nwidespread practice of relegating handicapped children to private institutions or\nwarehousing them in special classes.\" Here, the District itself agrees that A.C. should\nbe in an off-campus institution where she can receive individualized instruction in a\nsetting designed for students with disabilities like hers. No one is proposing a\nmainstream placement, or anything close to it. Moreover, the record amply\ndemonstrates that the decision to put A.C. into a residential facility is not mere\n\"warehousing\" but a considered judgment based on an assessment of her individual\nneeds. The only question here is whether she should go home at night or remain in a\nspecial institution twenty-four hours a day. Because the preponderance of the\nevidence shows that she will not receive educational benefit in the less restrictive\nsetting, the statute's preference is overcome here.\n\n       Finally, the District argues that neither it nor this Court has the power to order\nA.C. placed in a secure facility. That is beside the point. The question before us here\nis not whether A.C. must attend such a facility, but who should pay for it if she does.\n\n\n\n                                           V.\n\n      For the reasons stated, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the\ncause remanded for the development of an appropriate remedy. Fashioning an\nappropriate remedy will require findings of fact: for example, it must be determined\nwhether and when A.C. ceased to reside in the District, and whether RMA was an\n\n                                          -15-\n\fappropriate residential placement for her. We therefore remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\nHANSEN, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n       I agree with the court’s analysis in this case which concludes that the expert\ntestimony of record indicates that this is the very rare case where a school district is\nobligated to pay for a residential treatment setting as a related service in order to ensure\nthat the child receives the educational benefit that Congress has declared she is entitled\nto receive. I write specially to emphasize that the district court’s task on remand of\nfashioning an appropriate remedy will be a difficult one. In my view, the student is\nentitled to compensatory education but not to compensation in the form of dollar\ndamages.\n\n       The district court has broad discretionary authority to “grant such relief as the\ncourt determines is appropriate.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) (1998 Supp. IV). The\nSupreme Court has stated that the remedy granted must be one that is “appropriate” in\nlight of the purpose of the Act, which is to provide disabled “children with a free\nappropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services\ndesigned to meet their unique needs.” Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep’t of Educ.\nof Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369 (1985) (internal quotations omitted). The definition of\nrelated services “encompasses those supportive services that ‘may be required to assist\na child with a disability to benefit from special education.’” Cedar Rapids Cmty. Sch.\nDist. v. Garret F., 526 U.S. 66, 73 (1999) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(17) (1994),\nrenumbered as 20 U.S.C. § 1401(22) (Supp. IV 1998)). This language indicates that\ncompensatory educational services are an appropriate remedy. The statutory language\nalso permits the district court to authorize reimbursement to parents who have actually\nincurred expenses in funding an appropriate special education where the court\ndetermines that the school district’s IEP was inappropriate. Sch. Comm. of\nBurlington, 471 U.S. at 370. The Supreme Court rejected an attempt to characterize\n\n                                           -16-\n\fthis remedy as “damages,” noting that reimbursement merely requires the belated\npayment of expenses that the school district should have paid in the first instance. Id.\nat 370-71. We have specifically noted that appropriate relief under the IDEA “includes\ncompensatory education services but excludes general and punitive damages.”\nBirmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist., 220 F.3d 850, 856 (8th Cir. 2000) (internal citations\nomitted).\n\n       In my opinion, requiring the reimbursement of expenses already paid by the\nparents to ensure that a child’s education is at no cost to the parents is to be\ndistinguished from the granting of a windfall monetary award where the parents never\npaid for the child’s education. Here, the District violated its obligation to provide a free\nappropriate education and must provide an appropriate remedy. In this case, however,\nthe District’s ability to provide compensatory education to fulfill its obligation to the\nchild has been somewhat frustrated by the child’s removal of herself from the school\ndistrict. On the other hand, because the record does not show that her parent spent any\nmoney to enroll her in a residential treatment setting in order to obtain an appropriate\neducation for her, any monetary award cannot now be characterized as reimbursement\nand would do nothing to fulfill the purpose of the Act. In my view, the student is\nentitled to receive from the District at its expense the residential setting educational\nopportunity she was entitled to but did not receive, but only for the length of time she\nactually resided within the school district. That opportunity may only exist in a setting\noutside of the district. Neither her incorrigibility nor her parent’s inability to keep her\nin the school district or in the prior educational placements designed to meet her\nemotional and behavioral problems should be rewarded with money. Compensatory\neducation is appropriate, but compensatory dollar damages that may or may not be used\nto fund the education necessary for her and that do not amount to reimbursement are\nnot.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fA true copy.\n\n      Attest:\n\n               CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f",

ARNOLD, LAY, and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.\n                           ___________\n\nRICHARD S. ARNOLD, Circuit Judge.\n\n      This case arises under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),\n20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487 (1994) (amended 1997). A state hearing officer ordered the\nappellant, Independent School District No. 284 (\"the District\"), to pay the costs of a\nresidential education and treatment program for A.C., a student with a variety of\nemotional and behavioral problems. The District brought this action in federal district\ncourt pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2), and obtained a ruling that the residential\nplacement was not educationally necessary. A.C. appeals, and we reverse.\n\f                                           I.\n\n        When A.C. moved into the District, she was 15 years old. Her previous school\ndistrict had provided her with special-education services for emotional and behavioral\ndisorders and had developed an Individualized Education Program (IEP) which\nassigned her to a special, \"self-contained\" classroom. A.C.'s school-related problems\nincluded classroom disruption, profanity, insubordination, and truancy. School officials\nin her old district had tried to deal with these problems by allowing her to take her\nclasses at an off-campus day center for troubled kids. That didn't work: she would\neither leave the center or not show up at all. Outside of school, she used alcohol and\nillegal drugs, was sexually promiscuous, repeatedly ran away from home, was thought\nto have forged checks, and was hospitalized three times for threatening or attempting\nsuicide. Her mother, C.C., tried to get the county social services department to pay for\na residential treatment program. The county offered placement in a juvenile\ncorrectional facility, which C.C. declined. After that, C.C. stopped telling the county\nabout A.C.'s absences from home. C.C. also tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain a court\norder placing A.C. in a non-correctional residential treatment center.\n\n       When District No. 284 first took on the responsibility of educating A.C., it tried\nto implement the IEP from her old district. It placed her in one of two self-contained\nclassrooms for students with emotional and behavioral problems. On her third day of\nattendance, A.C. was suspended for behaving inappropriately, cursing, and disobeying\na school authority. The school returned A.C. to the self-contained classroom while it\nreviewed her placement. After a few days, she stopped coming to class. Meanwhile,\nC.C. resumed trying to obtain a court-ordered residential placement. A.C.'s current\nhigh school's social worker, her previous school's staff psychologist, and her IEP\nmanager wrote letters to the court. All three agreed that A.C.'s behavior was interfering\nwith her academic progress. The psychologist and the IEP manager also noted that past\neducational strategies had been ineffective, and said that A.C. needed a highly\nstructured program that would address her behavioral and psychological problems. The\n\n                                           -2-\n\fcourt refused to order a residential placement. Instead, it ordered A.C. to attend\nschool, an order with which she did not comply.\n\n       C.C. continued to pursue a residential placement. She had several meetings with\nA.C.'s IEP team and provided the District with the information presented to the juvenile\ncourt. As an interim measure, the District provided homebound instruction services,\nof which A.C. made sporadic use. For the longer term, the District said that it would\neither return A.C. to the self-contained classroom or enroll her in a day treatment\nprogram on the campus of the University of Minnesota, to which she could travel by\ncity bus. C.C. was not satisfied with these choices. She asked that A.C. be enrolled\nat Rocky Mountain Academy (RMA), a residential treatment center in Idaho, at District\nexpense. The District agreed to pay the \"educational\" costs of this placement, but not\ncosts related to therapy or lodging. In monetary terms, that meant the District would\npay a little more than one third of the $55,000 annual attendance charge for RMA.\n\n       With negotiations at an impasse, the District agreed to an Independent\nEducational Evaluation (IEE) of A.C. by a neuropsychologist on the faculty of the\nUniversity of Minnesota. The evaluator found no major attention problems,\nhyperactivity, learning disabilities, deficiencies of intelligence or memory, or the like.\nInstead, she traced A.C.'s educational problems to \"psychological difficulties\" such as\nher \"oppositionality, manipulative tendencies, and strong need for control and\nattention.\" On the basis of these observations, A.C. was diagnosed with \"conduct\ndisorder,\" but the evaluator explained in her deposition that this diagnostic category\nwas used mainly because the patient was still too young to be diagnosed with a\npersonality disorder. She said that a diagnosis of antisocial or narcissistic personality\ndisorder would probably be appropriate when A.C. reaches the age at which those\ncategories are applied. The evaluator strongly recommended that A.C. be placed in a\nsecure facility, largely to prevent truancy, and predicted that, after a course of\ntreatment, A.C. would probably be able to return to the classroom. According to\nfindings in the administrative record, the evaluator\n\n                                           -3-\n\f      considered a day treatment placement, and does not believe it will be\n      effective as the Student will not attend. While a day treatment facility\n      could provide educational services, the services would be ineffective . . .\n      due to the nature and extent of her emotional and behavioral disorder.\n\nFindings of Fact, Conclusions, and Decision of Independent Hearing Officer (hereafter\nIHO Decision) at 11. The state review officer found that the \"IEE Evaluator concluded\nunequivocally that it is necessary for Student to be in a secure residential treatment\nfacility in order for Student to gain educational benefit.\" Findings of Fact, Conclusions\nof Law, and Decision of Hearing Review Officer (hereafter HRO Decision) at 9. The\nprivate psychologist who has been treating A.C. since 1996 believes that she exhibits\nborderline personality development and may have dysthymia, a form of depression.\n\n        The controversy next went to an administrative hearing in the Minnesota\nDepartment of Children, Families, and Learning. The Independent Hearing Officer\nordered the District to provide 100 hours of compensatory education and to convene\nan IEP meeting for the purpose of \"locat[ing] an appropriate residential placement to\nmeet the Students [sic] emotional, behavioral and educational needs.\" IHO Decision\nat 21. The Hearing Review Officer affirmed. The District then commenced this action,\nas permitted by 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A). The District Court affirmed the award of\ncompensatory education, a decision from which the District does not appeal. As to the\nresidential placement, the District Court reversed. It noted that the IEE evaluator had\ntestified that the day program proposed in the District's IEP \" 'would educationally meet\nher needs, . . . from the standpoint of the individualized kind of work that she needs to\nmeet her educational needs.' \" Order at 5, quoting Hearing Transcript at 621. Because\nthe Court found nothing in the record to suggest that A.C.'s behavioral problems\nrendered her unable to attend the day program, it concluded that a residential\nplacement was not necessary to address her educational needs.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f                                           II.\n\n       The IDEA \"was intended to ensure that children with disabilities receive an\neducation that is both appropriate and free.\" Florence County School District 4 v.\nCarter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112910\"><a href=\"/opinion/112910/florence-county-school-dist-four-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (1993).

It defines \"special education\" to include \"instruction conducted\n. . . in hospitals and institutions,\" 20 U.S.C. § 1401(25); cf. 34 C.F.R. 300.26 (2000).\nRegulations promulgated under the statute by the United States Department of\nEducation require that, \"[i]f placement in a public or private residential program is\nnecessary to provide special education and related services to a child with a disability,\nthe program, including non-medical care and room and board, must be at no cost to the\nparents of the child.\" 34 C.F.R. § 300.302 (2000).

In Thompson v. Bd. of the Special School Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754529\"><a href=\"/opinion/754529/leroy-thompson-a-minor-by-and-through-his-parent-and-legal-guardian/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579 (8th Cir. 1998), we held that a student's IDEA claim was moot because his\nold district was not responsible for providing him a due-process hearing, which he\nrequested only after he had left the district to attend another school. Here, however,\nA.C.'s due-process hearing is over. A.C.'s claim in this case concerns obligations the\nDistrict allegedly had in the past and failed to meet. The remedy sought is\ncompensatory. It does not matter whether the District has any present or future\nobligation to develop a new IEP for her or to give her further hearings. If A.C. or her\nmother had paid the costs of a private placement at the time, and then sued the District\nfor reimbursement, the claim would not be moot. See Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills\nSchool Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112887\"><a href=\"/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 n.3 (1993). We think that the same result should obtain\nhere. In either case, the claim is that the statute obligated the school district to pay for\n\n                                            -7-\n\fthe placement during the time when it was responsible for the student's education.\nAssuming that A.C.'s claim has merit, it would not make sense to deny her a remedy\nagainst the District just because her parent did not or could not pay for the placement\nthat the District denied her.\n\n      We therefore turn to the merits. The District Court held that\n\n      the record . . . makes it clear that residential placement is necessary only\n      to treat Plaintiff's social and emotional problems, not for educational\n      purposes. . . . Student's problems, and the risks to which she is exposed,\n      are social and emotional in nature. In fact, the IEE Evaluator specifically\n      noted that Student has no neurological deficits which interfere with her\n      learning and is of average intelligence, with no symptoms of ADD or\n      ADHD, and found that day treatment would meet Plaintiff's educational\n      needs. [Citation omitted.] While one manifestation of A.C.'s emotional\n      behavioral disorder is her unwillingness to attend school or comply with\n      the requirements of ISD 284's IEP, there is nothing in the record to\n      support a conclusion that there is anything about A.C.'s disorder which\n      renders her unable to attend school or unable to comply with the IEP.\n\nOrder of Magistrate Judge at 10. There is much in this assessment with which we\nagree. Certainly no one disputes that A.C. has social and emotional problems, and the\nrecord would not support a finding that she has learning disabilities. We also think it\nunlikely that Congress meant for the IDEA to require states to provide a home away\nfrom home for students who simply make bad choices, even if those choices cause them\nto fail in school. See, e.g., Springer v. Fairfax County School Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751115\"><a href=\"/opinion/751115/edward-p-springer-a-minor-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-edward-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664\n(4th Cir. 1998) (holding that student diagnosed with \"conduct disorder\" did not have\nan emotional disturbance but was merely \"socially maladjusted\" under the precursor to\n34 C.F.R. § 300.7(c)(4)(ii) (2000)).\n\n     We do not believe, however, that the analysis can be limited to a stark distinction\nbetween unwillingness and inability to behave appropriately. There is a grey area\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fbetween normal, voluntary conduct and involuntary physiological response, and that\narea is where Congress has chosen to locate behavioral problems such as A.C.'s. The\nIDEA clearly includes \"emotional disturbance[s]\" as disabilities. 20 U.S.C. §\n1401(3)(A). According to the Department of Education, an emotional disturbance is\n\n       [A] condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteristics over\n       a long period of time and to a marked degree that adversely affects a\n       child's educational performance:\n\n             (A) An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual,\n       sensory, or health factors.\n\n              (B) An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal\n       relationships with peers and teachers.\n\n             (C) Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal\n       circumstances.\n\n              (D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.\n\n             (E) A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated\n       with personal or school problems.\n\n34 C.F.R. § 300.7(c)(4)(i). Read naturally and as a whole, the law and the regulations\nidentify a class of children who are disabled only in the sense that their abnormal\nemotional conditions prevent them from choosing normal responses to normal\nsituations.

Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111982\"><a href=\"/opinion/111982/honig-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (1988) (stating, of an emotionally disturbed student, that \"[i]t is [the student's]\nvery inability to conform his conduct to socially acceptable norms that renders him\n'handicapped' within the meaning of the EHA\").\n\n       Consistently with this reading, a child whose disabling condition manifests itself\nin disruptive conduct is exempted, to a degree, from normal disciplinary procedures.\n\n                                            -9-\n\fWhile Education Department regulations do permit children with disabilities to be\nsuspended from school under some circumstances, see 34 C.F.R. § 300.520(a)(1), the\nDepartment also instructs schools that suspension or expulsion is not normally\nappropriate as a first-line response to behavior problems resulting from a student's\ndisability, even if the conduct in question violates school rules. See 34 C.F.R. Part 300,\nApp. A, Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and Other Selected Implementation\nIssues, VI.38 (2000). Instead, the student's IEP team should address the behavior in\nthe first instance, using suspension and other disciplinary measures only if appropriate\nin the context of the IEP. Id. This does not mean that the IDEA has obliterated the\nconcept of personal responsibility, or that children with disabilities cannot be punished\nfor simple misbehavior. It merely reflects the Department's judgment that sometimes,\nwith certain children, what looks like simple misbehavior is actually a more\ncomplicated problem whose remedy should be integrated into the child's overall\nprogram of special education.\n\n       The preponderance of the evidence in the record before us supports the state's\nconclusion that A.C.'s truancy and classroom disruption belong in this category.\nAlthough the IEE evaluator reported that A.C. \"does not have any significant\nneurocognitive impairment,\" Summary of Evaluation at 6, cf. Hearing Transcript at 623,\nshe also found A.C. to be \"very impaired\" with respect to her disabling condition, and\neven repeated the phrase for emphasis. Hearing Transcript at 653. Asked to clarify,\nshe said that the latter finding related to \"[A.C.'s] conduct disorder and her total\nfunctional impairment. . . . [H]er ability to operate on a day-to-day basis is impaired.\nShe is not impaired cognitively.\" Id. at 662. Both the IEE evaluator and A.C.'s treating\npsychologist regard her lack of self-control as a settled disorder traceable to early\nexperiences. See Summary of Evaluation at 3-4 (noting that A.C.'s treating\npsychologist \"feels that [A.C.] has suffered significant trauma,\" stating that \"[i]t is clear\nfrom the interviews with [A.C.] and her mother that [A.C.] has experienced a\nsignificant emotional turmoil and that this has had a profound effect on her personality\ndevelopment,\" and tracing A.C.'s excessive need for control to her \" 'parental'\n\n                                            -10-\n\fexperiences as a young child\"). Perhaps these facts do not show that A.C. is irresistibly\ncompelled to cut school, but they do tend to show that her truancy and defiance of\nauthority result from a genuine emotional disturbance rather than from a purely moral\nfailing. The school district, which has the burden of proof here, see E.S., 135 F.3d at\n569, has presented no evidence to the contrary.\n\n       The District Court accurately described A.C.'s problems as \"social and emotional\nin nature,\" and concluded from this that they were \"separable from the learning\nprocess.\" Order of Magistrate Judge at 9-10. That conclusion does not follow. Apart\nfrom other reasons, the mere fact that Congress regards emotional disturbances as\ndisabilities entitling a child to special education shows that, at least in Congress's\njudgment, social and emotional problems are not ipso facto separable from the learning\nprocess. Nor do we agree with the Seventh Circuit that a problem resulting from a\ndisability is separable from the learning process if the problem is \"not primarily\neducational.\" Dale M. v. Bd. of Ed. of Bradley-Bourbonnais High School Dist. No.\n307, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771757\"><a href=\"/opinion/771757/dale-m-by-his-mother-and-next-friend-alice-m-v-board-of-education-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 817 (7th Cir. 2001). If the problem prevents a disabled child from\nreceiving educational benefit, then it should not matter that the problem is not cognitive\nin nature or that it causes the child even more trouble outside the classroom than within\nit. What should control our decision is not whether the problem itself is \"educational\"\nor \"non-educational,\" but whether it needs to be addressed in order for the child to\nlearn.\n\n       Moreover, the record here does not permit the conclusion that A.C.'s behavior\nproblems are separable from the learning process. The IEE evaluator made quite clear\nher judgment that A.C. will not receive educational benefit unless her emotional and\nbehavioral problems are dealt with. The school psychologist from her old district,\ndrawing on over two years of that district's experiences with her, said that \"[f]or any\nplacement to be successful, there will need to be the ability to exert sufficient control\nwhile providing a therapeutic approach.\" Letter of 9/22/98 at 2, Joint Appendix (JA)\nat 355. An assessment by District 284 itself, completed after A.C.'s brief period of\n\n                                          -11-\n\fattendance there, says that A.C.'s behavioral and emotional problems must be\naddressed if she is to succeed academically. Even the IEP at issue here states that\nA.C.'s \"[g]rades and credit completion suffer as a result of her explosive and\noppositional behavior,\" and that \"[s]he needs a high degree of structure and support,\nincluding immediate feedback with her behavior in order to be successful.\" IEP of\n3/19/99 at 2, JA at 357. This is not a case where the correction of behavioral and\nemotional problems is merely desirable in order to improve a student's performance:\nat the time of her hearing, which occurred at the end of her tenth-grade year, A.C. had\ncompleted only nine of the 32 credits required for graduation, although she is of\naverage intelligence and has no learning disability. Both hearing officers found that\nA.C.'s truancy and disruptiveness had substantially prevented her from receiving\neducational benefit. We see nothing in the record that would support a finding to the\ncontrary.\n\n                                           IV.\n\n       The remaining question, then, is whether A.C. can reasonably be expected to\nmake academic progress outside of a residential program. If we regard this as an\neducational question, there appears to be a consensus in the negative. A.C.'s treating\npsychologist, her IEE evaluator, her old district's school psychologist, her mother, and\nboth state hearing officers all have reached the conclusion that a residential placement\nis necessary in order for A.C. to get an education. It is true that the evaluator testified\nthat a day program like the one recommended by the District \"would educationally\nmeet [A.C.'s] needs,\" Hearing Transcript at 621, but it is clear from the context that this\nremark referred only to the appropriateness of the kind of instruction provided and not\nto the \"related services.\" Of all the educators whose views of the matter appear in the\nrecord, the only one that does not recommend a residential placement is the school\ndistrict that is being asked to pay for it. This tends to show that the District's\nrecommended placement is not reasonably calculated to enable A.C. to receive\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\feducational benefit, or, put otherwise, that a residential placement is necessary to\nprovide A.C. with special education and related services.\n\n       The District characterizes A.C.'s need for a residential placement as a need for\nconfinement, and argues that confinement is not a \"related service\" it is required to\nprovide. This view has some justification. The IEE evaluator testified that\n\n      the real issue is, you know, how can you get her into an educational\n      setting. When she is with her tutor and if she shows up for her tutoring,\n      she does her work and she is able to do her work. There is no problem\n      in doing her work. It is a question, really, of getting her and a teacher in\n      the same room and she getting to that place and sitting down with that\n      teacher.\n\nHearing Transcript at 622-23. In response to questioning by the District's attorney, she\nfurther stated that her recommendation of a residential placement was based on her\njudgment that A.C.\n\n      will leave any treatment facility. She will run from any treatment facility\n      that is not [sic] where she's not confined in some way, because,\n      ultimately, any treatment facility is going to ask her to do things that she\n      does not want to do. And that is why she cannot be educated in a normal\n      way, because she is not – she just will not attend.\n\nId. at 614. The evaluator also emphasized the benefit to A.C. of being prevented from\nusing drugs and from engaging in promiscuous sex. Id. at 618-19, 623.\n\n       These statements should not be viewed in isolation, however. Taken as a whole,\nthe IEE evaluator's testimony suggests that a residential placement is necessary in order\nto correct A.C.'s behavioral and emotional problems, not just to keep her off the streets\nor to force her to sit down with a tutor. Although tests reveal A.C. to be a shrewd\nproblem solver, she fails to exercise good judgment in her dealings with others because\n\n                                          -13-\n\fshe lacks empathy, defined as \"the ability . . . to gauge behavior according to what\nother people want from you.\" Hearing Transcript at 590. This deficiency was\nconfirmed, for example, by her Rorschach inkblot test, in which she identified none of\nthe shapes as human. Id. at 592. When asked to give a prognosis for A.C., the\nevaluator said, \"I think she can improve . . . otherwise, you would just put her in a\nconfined situation without any treatment. Obviously, I think there can be\nimprovement.\" She testified that neither medication, individual psychotherapy, nor\nfamily therapy was likely to do much good, but that the residential aspect of a secure\nfacility would probably have therapeutic benefit:\n\n      the fact is that at a residential treatment program, . . . the environment is\n      the therapy. And, you know, I think that it's a sort of a relearning process\n      that she needs. I mean, she needs socialization. . . . [S]he's very\n      narcissistic and does not have this sort of sense of what the other feels or\n      what the other is responding to.\n\n             And so, you know, I think in a setting where that kind of emphasis\n      is placed in terms of the interactions with others – you know, sometimes\n      peer pressure can be very effective with individuals like her. If everybody\n      in her unit is pressuring her to behave in a certain way or her counselor is\n      pressuring her to behave and she has to alter her behavior under those\n      conditions. So that's what an environment, you know, is going to do for\n      her. Psychotherapy is not going to do that.\n\nId. at 617-18. It would be one-sided, therefore, to say that mere confinement was the\nevaluator's reason for recommending a residential placement. An independent and\nsufficient reason for that recommendation was to provide treatment for a psychological\nproblem that has prevented A.C. from making acceptable academic progress.\n\n\n\n      The District also argues that the IDEA's preference for mainstream placements\ncounsels against placing A.C. in a residential facility. Although our cases have placed\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\femphasis on this statutory preference, see, e.g., Springdale School Dist. No. 50 of\nWashington County v.

The statute requires\nmainstreaming only \"to the maximum extent appropriate,\" not to the maximum extent\npossible. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(5)(A).

No one is proposing a\nmainstream placement, or anything close to it. Moreover, the record amply\ndemonstrates that the decision to put A.C. into a residential facility is not mere\n\"warehousing\" but a considered judgment based on an assessment of her individual\nneeds. The only question here is whether she should go home at night or remain in a\nspecial institution twenty-four hours a day. Because the preponderance of the\nevidence shows that she will not receive educational benefit in the less restrictive\nsetting, the statute's preference is overcome here.\n\n       Finally, the District argues that neither it nor this Court has the power to order\nA.C. placed in a secure facility. That is beside the point. The question before us here\nis not whether A.C. must attend such a facility, but who should pay for it if she does.\n\n\n\n                                           V.\n\n      For the reasons stated, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the\ncause remanded for the development of an appropriate remedy. Fashioning an\nappropriate remedy will require findings of fact: for example, it must be determined\nwhether and when A.C. ceased to reside in the District, and whether RMA was an\n\n                                          -15-\n\fappropriate residential placement for her. We therefore remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\nHANSEN, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n       I agree with the court’s analysis in this case which concludes that the expert\ntestimony of record indicates that this is the very rare case where a school district is\nobligated to pay for a residential treatment setting as a related service in order to ensure\nthat the child receives the educational benefit that Congress has declared she is entitled\nto receive. I write specially to emphasize that the district court’s task on remand of\nfashioning an appropriate remedy will be a difficult one. In my view, the student is\nentitled to compensatory education but not to compensation in the form of dollar\ndamages.\n\n       The district court has broad discretionary authority to “grant such relief as the\ncourt determines is appropriate.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) (1998 Supp. IV).

This language indicates that\ncompensatory educational services are an appropriate remedy. The statutory language\nalso permits the district court to authorize reimbursement to parents who have actually\nincurred expenses in funding an appropriate special education where the court\ndetermines that the school district’s IEP was inappropriate. Sch. Comm. of\nBurlington, 471 U.S. at 370. The Supreme Court rejected an attempt to characterize\n\n                                           -16-\n\fthis remedy as “damages,” noting that reimbursement merely requires the belated\npayment of expenses that the school district should have paid in the first instance. Id.\nat 370-71. We have specifically noted that appropriate relief under the IDEA “includes\ncompensatory education services but excludes general and punitive damages.”\nBirmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769676\"><a href=\"/opinion/769676/brenda-deann-birmingham-v-omaha-school-district-david-land-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 856 (8th Cir. 2000) (internal citations\nomitted).\n\n       In my opinion, requiring the reimbursement of expenses already paid by the\nparents to ensure that a child’s education is at no cost to the parents is to be\ndistinguished from the granting of a windfall monetary award where the parents never\npaid for the child’s education. Here, the District violated its obligation to provide a free\nappropriate education and must provide an appropriate remedy. In this case, however,\nthe District’s ability to provide compensatory education to fulfill its obligation to the\nchild has been somewhat frustrated by the child’s removal of herself from the school\ndistrict. On the other hand, because the record does not show that her parent spent any\nmoney to enroll her in a residential treatment setting in order to obtain an appropriate\neducation for her, any monetary award cannot now be characterized as reimbursement\nand would do nothing to fulfill the purpose of the Act. In my view, the student is\nentitled to receive from the District at its expense the residential setting educational\nopportunity she was entitled to but did not receive, but only for the length of time she\nactually resided within the school district. That opportunity may only exist in a setting\noutside of the district. Neither her incorrigibility nor her parent’s inability to keep her\nin the school district or in the prior educational placements designed to meet her\nemotional and behavioral problems should be rewarded with money. Compensatory\neducation is appropriate, but compensatory dollar damages that may or may not be used\nto fund the education necessary for her and that do not amount to reimbursement are\nnot.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fA true copy.\n\n      Attest:\n\n               CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f</pre>",
