This was accomplished      by the Board in the\nform of a resolution       which you have presented    to us along with a\nletter asking:\n              ”\n                 . D * whether   this resolution complies      with the\n       decision    in the Delgado    Case, as our approval      or dis-\n       approval     of this zoning matter rests primarily        upon\n       this fact.”\n\n               The resolution    in substance   reorganizes   the school\ndistrict into three wards and provides        that pupils in each ward are\nto attend a designated     school.   It states in great length the neces-\nsity for such changes enumerating          among other things limited\nschool facilities,    change in population,    the dangers  of traffic,  and\nother hazards      under the present    plan.\n\n             At the outset we are confronted~with     the question  of\nthe power of the School Board to create zones and assign students\nfrom each zone to a particular   school.   In this regard,   Art. 2780,\nV.C.S., provides:\n\n               “Said trustees    shall adopt such rules, regula-\n       tions and by-laws      as they deem proper;     and the pub-\n       lic free schools    of such independent    district   shall be\n       under their control;     they shall have the exclusive\n       power to manage and govern said schools,            and all\n       rights and titles to property     for school purposes.      . . .((\n\n              It is settled in this State that the Boards       of Trustees\nof independent    school districts    are vested with the duty and dis-\ncretion to manage and regulate        the schools    of their respective\ndistricts and to administer      the affairs   of those schools    in such a\nmanner as in their judgment        best accomplishes      the wholesome\n\f                                                                                         .   .\n\n\nHon.

Miles,  300 S.\nW. 211 (Tex. Civ. App. 1927).\n\n              In the case of Boydstun v. Ft. Worth Independent\nSchool District,    33 S.W.2d 811 (Tex. Civ. App. 1930), the School\nBoard reorganized,       among other things, the geographic    bounda-\nries of certain    schools.   Some pupils were required    to attend\nschools  more distant from their home.       The Court of Civil Ap-\npeals refused    to set aside this action, and in so doing stated:\n\n               “By the terms of that Article       (2780) the public\n       free schools    of an independent     school district    are\n       declared   to be under the control      of the trustees,     and\n       ‘they shall have the exclusive       power to manage and\n       govern said schools.’       It has been repeatedly     held\n       that, in the absence    of circumstances       not appearing\n       in this case, the power thus given to trustees          of an\n       independent    school district    is exclusive    and precludes\n       any power on the part of the courts to interfere           with\n       or control   the good-faith    action by them.”\n\n             It is apparent       from the foregoing    that the power to pro-\nmulgate  zoning resolutions         is within the authority   and discretion of\nthe Board of Trustees.\n\n                 Having determined    that the Board has the authority   to\npromulgate       a resolution  such as the one submitted,  it is necessary\nto scrutinize      the one adopted to determine   whether the School Board\nexercised     its power in a manner which is consistent      with the law.\n\n              In Delgado v. Bastrop          Independent      School   District,   (W.\nD. Tex.   1948, unreported), Judge          Rice ruled:\n\n                “The regulations,      customs,       usages,   and prac-\n       tices of the defendant,        Bastrop     Independent      School\n       District    of Bastrop     County . 0 D insofar       as they or\n       any of them have segregated             pupils of Mexican         or\n       other Latin American          descent in separate         classes\n       and schools     within the respective          school districts       of\n       the defendant      school district     heretofore      set forth are,\n       and e,ach of them is, arbitrary           and discriminatory\n       and in violation      of the plaintiff’s     constitutional      rights\n       as guaranteed       by the Fourteenth        Amendment        to the\n       Constitution     of the United States, and are illegal.              00.\n       The defendants       .

This resolution,   however,     provides:\n\n                “AND, BE IT FURTHER           RESOLVED,      that all\n       scholastics,    regardless     of ancestry  or racial   deriva-\n       tion or origin,    enrolled   in grades one to six, inclu-\n       sive, of the schools      of this District and residing     with-\n       in Zone or Ward No. One, shall attend only the South\n       Side Elementary       School and no other school of this\n       District.\n\n                “AND, BE IT FURTHER            RESOLVED,      that all\n       scholastics,    regardless     of ancestry   or racial   deriva-\n       tion or orisin.    enrolled   in srades one to six, inclu-\n       sive, of the schools      of this-District  and residing     with-\n       in Zone or Ward No. Two, shall attend only the Cam-\n       pus Elementary       School and no other school of this\n       District.\n\n                “AND, BE IT FURTHER            RESOLVED,       that all\n       scholastics,     regardless     of ancestry   or racial   deriva-\n       tion or origin,     enrolled   in grades    one to six, inclusive,\n       of the schools      of this District   and residing    within\n       Zone or Ward No. Three           shall attend only the Cam-\n       pus Elementary        School and no other school of this\n       District.    . . *‘* (Emphasis     is added throughout      this\n       opinion.)\n\n                 The resolution     on its face is valid.      It affirmatively\nrecites    that children    of other than the Negro race must attend the\nschool assigned       to the zone of his residence         “regardless      of an-\ncestry   or racial derivation        or origin.”    There    is nothing in the\nresolution     to indicate   that there was any intention         on the part of\nthe Board to discriminate          against or segregate        members      of any\ngroup.     The resolution      by its terms does not separate           Latin and\nAnglo American         students.    On the contrary,      it expressly     provides\nthai regardless      of ancestry     or racial   derivation     the students liv-\ning in the respective       zones must attend the school designated              and\nno other.\n\fHon.   L. A. Woods,    Page   4 (V-840)\n\n\n\n\n               The Courts have allowed      school authorities widediscre-\ntion in the designation   of school zone areas.       Whether    or not the\ngeographic    zoning is reasonable     is a question   of fact depending    on\nall the facts and circumstancrs       which must be considered.         The\ndecision   of the school board will not be disturbed        unless it is\nclearly  shown to be arbitrary,     capricious,    and without justifica-\ntion in fact. l The courts in the great number of the cases have\nupheld the zoning regulations      of the school authorities,     despite\nthe fact that in some instances      inconvenience    might result. 2\n\n             On the other hand, a regulation    which appears     to be\nvalid on its face may, in actual practice,   be applied or adminis-\ntered in such a way as to cause violation    of the rights of individ-\nuals or groups.   This is true with regard    to those rights secured\nby the Fourteenth   Amendment    of the Federal   Constitution.     The\ncourse of action which the courts and administrative        agencies    will\nfollow in such a situation is best stated in Yick Wo v0 Hopkins,         118\nU.S. 356 (1886).  There   the United States Supreme      Court stated:\n              .I\n                  . . . In the present    case we are not obliged\n       to reason from the probable          to the actual, and pass\n       upon the validity      of the ordinances     complained      of, as\n       tried merely      by the opportunities      which their terms\n       afford,   of unequal and unjust discrimination            in their\n       administration.       For the cases present the ordinances\n       in actual operation,       and the facts shown establish         an\n       administration      directed   so exclusively     against a par-\n       ticular   class of persons      as to warrant     and require\n       the conclusion,      that, whatever     may have been the in-\n       tent of the ordinances       as adopted, they are applied by\n       the public authorities       charged with their administra-\n       tion, and thus representing        the State itself,    with a\n       mind so unequal and oppressive            as to amount to a\n       practical     denial by the State of that equal protection\n       of the laws which is secured          to the petitioners,     as to\n       all other persons,       by the broad and benign provisions\n\n\n\n       ‘Love  v.

Whethe,r the San Marcos      zoning~. resolution,    val-\n    id on its face, in fact establishes    an unlawful segregation       of Latin\n    American    students is a question    of fact to be determined       by the\n    State Superintendent    of Public Instruction.\n\n                    The question of the proper      administration   of an order\n    valid on its face is also an issue of fact.        The primary     responsi-\n    bility for determining      these fact issues is placed upon the School\n    Board.      An appeal from its ruling may be taken through the vari-\n    ous agencies      in the Department    of Education.     Art. 2656, V.C.S.\n    These questions       may be presented     to the court after administra-\n    tive remedies       have been exhausted.    3 The courts will then deter-\n    mine if there is substantial      evidence    to support the order in ques-\n    tion.     The order will not be disturbed      unless clearly  arbitrary     and\n    capricious.     4 In all such cases the legal presumption        is that public\n    officials    have done and will do their duty. 5\n\n\n\n\n           3Cook v.

This was accomplished      by the Board in the\nform of a resolution       which you have presented    to us along with a\nletter asking:\n              ”\n                 .

It states in great length the neces-\nsity for such changes enumerating          among other things limited\nschool facilities,    change in population,    the dangers  of traffic,  and\nother hazards      under the present    plan.\n\n             At the outset we are confronted~with     the question  of\nthe power of the School Board to create zones and assign students\nfrom each zone to a particular   school.   In this regard,   Art. 2780,\nV.C.S., provides:\n\n               “Said trustees    shall adopt such rules, regula-\n       tions and by-laws      as they deem proper;     and the pub-\n       lic free schools    of such independent    district   shall be\n       under their control;     they shall have the exclusive\n       power to manage and govern said schools,            and all\n       rights and titles to property     for school purposes.      . . .((\n\n              It is settled in this State that the Boards       of Trustees\nof independent    school districts    are vested with the duty and dis-\ncretion to manage and regulate        the schools    of their respective\ndistricts and to administer      the affairs   of those schools    in such a\nmanner as in their judgment        best accomplishes      the wholesome\n\f                                                                                         .   .\n\n\nHon.

Some pupils were required    to attend\nschools  more distant from their home.       The Court of Civil Ap-\npeals refused    to set aside this action, and in so doing stated:\n\n               “By the terms of that Article       (2780) the public\n       free schools    of an independent     school district    are\n       declared   to be under the control      of the trustees,     and\n       ‘they shall have the exclusive       power to manage and\n       govern said schools.’       It has been repeatedly     held\n       that, in the absence    of circumstances       not appearing\n       in this case, the power thus given to trustees          of an\n       independent    school district    is exclusive    and precludes\n       any power on the part of the courts to interfere           with\n       or control   the good-faith    action by them.”\n\n             It is apparent       from the foregoing    that the power to pro-\nmulgate  zoning resolutions         is within the authority   and discretion of\nthe Board of Trustees.\n\n                 Having determined    that the Board has the authority   to\npromulgate       a resolution  such as the one submitted,  it is necessary\nto scrutinize      the one adopted to determine   whether the School Board\nexercised     its power in a manner which is consistent      with the law.\n\n              In Delgado v.

This resolution,   however,     provides:\n\n                “AND, BE IT FURTHER           RESOLVED,      that all\n       scholastics,    regardless     of ancestry  or racial   deriva-\n       tion or origin,    enrolled   in grades one to six, inclu-\n       sive, of the schools      of this District and residing     with-\n       in Zone or Ward No. One, shall attend only the South\n       Side Elementary       School and no other school of this\n       District.\n\n                “AND, BE IT FURTHER            RESOLVED,      that all\n       scholastics,    regardless     of ancestry   or racial   deriva-\n       tion or orisin.    enrolled   in srades one to six, inclu-\n       sive, of the schools      of this-District  and residing     with-\n       in Zone or Ward No. Two, shall attend only the Cam-\n       pus Elementary       School and no other school of this\n       District.\n\n                “AND, BE IT FURTHER            RESOLVED,       that all\n       scholastics,     regardless     of ancestry   or racial   deriva-\n       tion or origin,     enrolled   in grades    one to six, inclusive,\n       of the schools      of this District   and residing    within\n       Zone or Ward No. Three           shall attend only the Cam-\n       pus Elementary        School and no other school of this\n       District.    . . *‘* (Emphasis     is added throughout      this\n       opinion.)\n\n                 The resolution     on its face is valid.      It affirmatively\nrecites    that children    of other than the Negro race must attend the\nschool assigned       to the zone of his residence         “regardless      of an-\ncestry   or racial derivation        or origin.”    There    is nothing in the\nresolution     to indicate   that there was any intention         on the part of\nthe Board to discriminate          against or segregate        members      of any\ngroup.     The resolution      by its terms does not separate           Latin and\nAnglo American         students.    On the contrary,      it expressly     provides\nthai regardless      of ancestry     or racial   derivation     the students liv-\ning in the respective       zones must attend the school designated              and\nno other.\n\fHon.   L. A. Woods,    Page   4 (V-840)\n\n\n\n\n               The Courts have allowed      school authorities widediscre-\ntion in the designation   of school zone areas.       Whether    or not the\ngeographic    zoning is reasonable     is a question   of fact depending    on\nall the facts and circumstancrs       which must be considered.         The\ndecision   of the school board will not be disturbed        unless it is\nclearly  shown to be arbitrary,     capricious,    and without justifica-\ntion in fact. l The courts in the great number of the cases have\nupheld the zoning regulations      of the school authorities,     despite\nthe fact that in some instances      inconvenience    might result. 2\n\n             On the other hand, a regulation    which appears     to be\nvalid on its face may, in actual practice,   be applied or adminis-\ntered in such a way as to cause violation    of the rights of individ-\nuals or groups.   This is true with regard    to those rights secured\nby the Fourteenth   Amendment    of the Federal   Constitution.     The\ncourse of action which the courts and administrative        agencies    will\nfollow in such a situation is best stated in Yick Wo v0 Hopkins,         </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1886).
