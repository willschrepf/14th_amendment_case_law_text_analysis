Cure appeals from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court\n\f                                                                                                2\n\nof Clark County, Domestic Relations Division, which granted Andrew Cure’s motion for a\n\nreallocation of parental rights of their minor son, named Mr. Cure as the residential parent,\n\nfound Ms. Cure in contempt of court, and imposed a suspended sentence on the condition\n\nthat Ms. Cure comply with the court’s orders in the future.\n\n       {¶ 2}     For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in modifying the Cures’ parental rights or in finding Ms. Cure in\n\ncontempt.\n\n                                Facts & Procedural History\n\n       {¶ 3}     The Cures were married for less than three years and were separated\n\nmultiple times before their divorce in 2008. They had one son, who was born prior to\n\ntheir marriage and was five years old at the time of the divorce. Pursuant to the divorce\n\ndecree, Ms. Cure was named as the residential parent, and Mr. Cure was awarded\n\nvisitation. After the divorce, the parties lived near one another in Clark County. Ms.\n\nCure was also the residential parent of another child, a daughter from a previous marriage;\n\nthe daughter’s father also had visitation and lived nearby.\n\n       {¶ 4}     In June 2011, Ms. Cure moved to a home she had recently purchased in\n\nLebanon, Ohio. She lived there with her boyfriend, John Haynes, who was a Hamilton\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Deputy and was required to live within 30 miles of the Hamilton County\n\nJustice Center. At the time of Ms. Cure’s move, Mr. Haynes was married to Stacy\n\nHaynes, and no complaint for divorce had been filed. Ms. Cure’s residence in Lebanon\n\nwas more than an hour away from Mr. Cure’s residence, which made it difficult for him to\n\nexercise his mid-week visitation with their son, who was 8 years old.\n\f                                                                                               3\n\n        {¶ 5}     Mr. Cure filed motions for reallocation of parental rights and to show\n\ncause why Ms. Cure should not be held in contempt. The motion for reallocation of\n\nparental rights focused on the instability created by Ms. Cure’s dating habits and Mr.\n\nCure’s concern about his son’s exposure to Mr. Haynes; while the motion was pending,\n\nthe court ordered that Mr. Haynes should not spend any unsupervised time alone with the\n\nchild. The motion for a finding of contempt initially focused on Ms. Cure’s failure to\n\ninform Mr. Cure of the move, but, as the case unfolded, the court also considered Mr.\n\nCure’s claim that Ms. Cure was in contempt for allowing their son to be alone with Mr.\n\nHaynes, contrary to the court’s interim order. Brian Gartin, the father of Ms. Cure’s\n\ndaughter, also filed a motion for reallocation of parental rights (Case No. 02-DS-0077).\n\nBy agreement of the parties, the motions of Mr. Cure and Mr. Gartin were heard together\n\nby the trial court.\n\n        {¶ 6}     The court held a hearing on August 2, 4, 16 and 18, 2011. The trial court\n\ngranted Mr. Cure’s motion for reallocation of parental rights, named Mr. Cure the\n\nresidential parent, set visitation for Ms. Cure, and ordered Ms. Cure to pay child support.\n\n It also found Ms. Cure in contempt of court for permitting the Cures’ son to be in the\n\npresence of Mr. Haynes, unsupervised. The court imposed a 30-day jail sentence for the\n\ncontempt, but suspended the sentence on the condition that Ms. Cure comply with the\n\ncourt’s continuing order that the child not be left alone with Mr. Haynes. Mr. Gartin’s\n\nmotions for reallocation of parental rights and for a finding of contempt were also granted,\n\nbut those judgments are not relevant to this appeal.\n\n        {¶ 7}     Ms. Cure appeals, raising three assignments of error.      The first two\n\f                                                                                                4\n\nassignments relate to separate prongs of the standard for reallocation of parental rights; as\n\nsuch, we will address them together.\n\n                              Reallocation of Parental Rights\n\n       {¶ 8}      Ms. Cure’s first and second assignments of error state:\n\n                The trial court abused its discretion in finding that there was a\n\n       substantive change of circumstances.\n\n                The trial court next abused its discretion in finding that there\n\n       was a substantial change of circumstances and it would be in the best\n\n       interest of the child to reallocate custody.\n\n         {¶ 9} Ms. Cure argues that the trial court did not properly find a change of\n\n  circumstances or that it would be in the best interest of the child to change custody, as\n\n  required to reallocate parental rights.\n\n         A. Standard of Review\n\n         {¶ 10}          In order to prevail on a motion for reallocation of parental rights,\n\n  the movant must demonstrate that (1) there has been a change in the circumstances of\n\n  the child or the residential parent, (2) modification of the existing custody decree is\n\n  necessary to serve the child’s best interest, and (3) the harm likely to be caused to the\n\n  child by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of\n\n  environment. R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a); Chaney v. Chaney, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n  24880, 2012-Ohio-626, ¶ 10.\n\n       {¶ 11}     A change in circumstances must be one of substance, not slight or\n\ninconsequential, to justify modifying a prior custody order. Davis v. Flickinger, 77 Ohio\n\f                                                                                               5\n\nSt.3d 415, 418, 674 N.E.2d 1159 (1997).           “In determining whether a change in\n\ncircumstances has occurred so as to warrant a change in custody, a trial judge, as the trier\n\nof fact, must be given wide latitude to consider all issues which support such a change.”\n\nId. at paragraph two of the syllabus. We review a trial court’s ruling on a motion for\n\nreallocation of parental rights for an abuse of discretion. Chaney at ¶ 9; Musgrove v.\n\nMusgrove, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24640, 2011-Ohio-4460, ¶ 7.\n\n       B. Evidence Presented at the Hearing\n\n       {¶ 12}    Ms. Cure’s testimony at the hearing established that she had been\n\nromantically involved and had lived with several men during her son’s life other than his\n\nfather, that she had lived with her son at five different residences, and that her son had\n\nattended three different schools between kindergarten and third grade.    She claimed that\n\nshe and Mr. Haynes were engaged to be married and that he was the “man of her dreams.”\n\nShe also expressed her belief that her move to Lebanon was good for her son because\n\nLebanon’s school district was better than their previous school district. She believed,\n\nwithout reservation, that she was “the better parent” and the “most stable parent” for her\n\nson.\n\n       {¶ 13}    Ms. Cure’s boyfriend, Mr. Haynes, testified about his close relationship\n\nwith Ms. Cure, his belief that they would stay together long-term, and the close\n\nrelationship that he and Ms. Cure have with one another’s children.           However, he\n\ncontradicted Ms. Cure’s claim that they were engaged, pointing out that he was still\n\nmarried; he also claimed that he did not want to marry Ms. Cure until he could afford to\n\npay for the wedding and a ring himself, because she had paid for her previous wedding.\n\f                                                                                               6\n\n       {¶ 14}    Mr. Haynes also testified about his employment with the Hamilton\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Department, which requires him to live within 30 miles of the Hamilton\n\nCounty Justice Center in downtown Cincinnati. (Ms. Cure’s house in Lebanon is within\n\nthis distance, but her residence in Clark County was not.) Mr. Haynes testified that he\n\nworks on the bomb squad and that his skills were not easily transferrable to other sheriffs’\n\nor police departments, because most departments do not maintain their own bomb squad.\n\nWhen asked about disciplinary and legal issues related to his employment, Mr. Haynes\n\nadmitted involvement in an incident for which he was disciplined and was being sued; the\n\nincident involved the excessive use of force against a motorist who was tazed and\n\nforcefully removed from a car while having a diabetic seizure, resulting in injury to the\n\nmotorist.   Mr. Haynes denied that there were other disciplinary issues related to his\n\nemployment and that other deputies were reluctant to work with him because of the\n\nlikelihood of a lawsuit arising from his behavior.\n\n       {¶ 15}    Mr. Haynes’s wife, Stacy, also testified; at the time of the hearing, the\n\nHayneses were in the process of divorcing after 18 years of marriage. Mr. and Mrs.\n\nHaynes testified at length about events that occurred during the months preceding their\n\nseparation, and their testimony was often in conflict. For example, Mr. Haynes claimed\n\nthat he had moved into the basement and that he and his wife had been living “separately”\n\nbeginning in early 2010; thereafter, he had an affair with a fellow police officer, and then\n\nbegan his relationship with Ms. Cure in the spring of 2010. Mrs. Haynes testified,\n\nhowever, that Mr. Haynes never moved into their basement, that she was unaware of\n\nproblems in their marriage until May 2010, around Mother’s Day, when the officer\n\f                                                                                              7\n\ninvolved with Mr. Haynes came to their home, and that, although they were separated, she\n\n(Mrs. Haynes) and Mr. Haynes continued to work on reconciling throughout the summer\n\nof 2010. By this time, however, Ms. Cure had purchased the house in Lebanon, and Mr.\n\nHaynes was living there. Also, in the summer of 2010, Mr. Haynes paid $1,800 toward\n\nthe mortgage and utilities at Ms. Cure’s new home in Lebanon, while he was in arrears on\n\nhis spousal support and child support payments to Mrs. Haynes. Mrs. Haynes had two\n\nyoung children and was not employed outside the home, and the Hayneses’ house ended\n\nup in foreclosure; notwithstanding the court-ordered support, Mr. Haynes believed that\n\nMrs. Haynes should have gotten a job to help with the house payments and her other\n\nexpenses.\n\n       {¶ 16}    According to Mrs. Haynes, Mr. Haynes masturbated while looking at\n\npornography on their home computer with their young children nearby; he did not think\n\nthis behavior was problematic, because he did not think the children were capable of\n\nunderstanding it. Mr. Haynes stored pornographic pictures on the computer, including,\n\nMrs. Haynes eventually discovered, pictures of himself engaged in sexual activities with\n\nother women; in one of these pictures, he was wearing a blue wristband issued to Mr. and\n\nMrs. Haynes while she was in the hospital when their twins were born. Mr. Haynes\n\ndenied that he was the man in any of the pornographic pictures on the computer. Mr.\n\nHaynes admitted that he had had sexual relations with one of his girlfriends, the police\n\nofficer, at the marital home before he was separated from Mrs. Haynes.\n\n       {¶ 17}    Mr. Haynes claimed that his frequent visits to pornographic websites and,\n\nparticularly, websites of escort services, were related to his employment, through which he\n\f                                                                                                8\n\nwas responsible for identifying and arresting prostitutes; although some of the escort\n\nservices operated outside of his jurisdiction, he claimed that they bordered on his\n\njurisdiction. He also claimed that his practice of masturbating to pornography was related\n\nto his wife’s infertility treatments, for which he was required to collect semen, but Mrs.\n\nHaynes testified that the infertility treatments did not require Mr. Haynes to collect semen\n\nat home. At one point in his testimony, Mr. Haynes admitted to having had one to ten\n\naffairs during his marriage, although his testimony established at least two affairs – with a\n\nfellow officer and Ms. Cure – toward the end of his marriage; at another point, he stated\n\nthat he told Ms. Cure of five affairs during his marriage and that, in his deposition, he\n\n“guess[ed] it could have been” 200. Mr. Haynes also admitted that he had been alone\n\nwith Ms. Cure’s son and daughter in recent months, notwithstanding the court’s order that\n\nany time he spent with them should be supervised. He believed that, because Ms. Cure\n\nhad been close-by, his conduct had not violated the order.\n\n       {¶ 18}    Mrs. Haynes described Mr. Haynes as exhibiting unreasonable or\n\nirrational behavior and stated that, although he could be “wonderful” 95% of the time, the\n\nother 5% was “so bad that it invaded [her] whole existence.” She testified that he used\n\nprofanity toward their children (twins, who were age three at the time of the hearing), and\n\nthat he had in the past forced food into the children’s mouths that was either too hot or too\n\nlarge or thick for them to safely eat. She did not believe, however, that he was a danger to\n\nher own children or to Ms. Cure’s children.\n\n       {¶ 19}    Mr. Cure testified that he had resided with his fiancee, Mirandia McCoy,\n\nfor four years, and that he had never cheated on her or separated from her during that time.\n\f                                                                                                9\n\n He described being active in his son’s sports, school conferences, and doctor’s\n\nappointments, stated that his son has good friends in the neighborhood, and that his son\n\nwas well-adjusted.\n\n        {¶ 20}   Mr. Cure testified that Ms. Cure’s move to Lebanon made it very difficult\n\nfor him to exercise his mid-week visitation, because the length of the drive (one hour and\n\n15 minutes each way) and the son’s need to be at school early the next day made it very\n\ntiring for his son to come to his house on a weeknight. For this reason, Mr. Cure had not\n\nbeen taking his son to his Clark County home for mid-week visitation since Ms. Cure’s\n\nmove.\n\n        {¶ 21}   With respect to Ms. Cure, Mr. Cure expressed concern about the “lack of\n\ncontinuity” in his son’s life while living with Ms. Cure, because his son had experienced\n\nfour moves and three schools in a four-year period. He also expressed his belief that this\n\npattern would continue and that the “volatility * * * is going to blow up on” his son. He\n\nclaimed that both Ms. Cure and Mr. Haynes had volatile personalities, and he expressed\n\ndispleasure that Ms. Cure introduces their son to the men she is dating within weeks of the\n\nstart of the relationship, and even moves in with them. Mr. Cure testified that his son is\n\n“leery” and “afraid” of his mom sometimes, because of her yelling and his fear of getting\n\nin trouble.   Mr. Cure also stated that Ms. Cure is not forthcoming with him about\n\ninformation regarding their son, such as health issues, and that she does not promote a\n\npositive relationship between father and son.\n\n        {¶ 22}   Mr. Cure admitted that, on one occasion when Ms. Cure’s older daughter\n\nwas at their home, he held the girl by the face to get her attention, which apparently scared\n\f                                                                                            10\n\nthe child and was a memorable event for her. Mr. Cure stated that he felt badly that the\n\nincident had scared the girl, but he had seen Ms. Cure do the same thing and believed it\n\nwas a way to get the child to listen to him.\n\n       {¶ 23}    Ms. Cure denied that Mr. Cure was active in their son’s life, and claimed\n\nthat he only visited with their son 70-80% of the time that he was entitled to do so. She\n\nalso testified to her belief that Mr. Cure frequently leaves their son with Mr. Cure’s mother\n\n(the son’s grandmother) during his visitation.\n\n       {¶ 24}    The trial court also considered the report of the guardian ad litem, but the\n\nguardian ad litem did not testify at the hearing. In his report, the guardian ad litem\n\nrecognized that Ms. Cure’s choices in relationships “have not always been good” and that\n\nit would have been more reasonable for her to proceed more slowly in her relationship\n\nwith Mr. Haynes. He also stated that Ms. Cure “see[s] the existence of the children’s\n\nfathers as a nuisance,” whereas the guardian ad litem believed that the fathers were\n\n“primarily motivated by genuine concerns” for the children. The guardian ad litem did\n\nnot believe that Mr. Haynes posed a danger to the Cures’ son. The guardian ad litem\n\nconcluded that Ms. Cure’s move to Lebanon had not “created a change of circumstances of\n\nsubstance” and that she should remain the residential parent.\n\n       C. The Trial Court’s Decision\n\n       {¶ 25}    The trial court found that a change of circumstances had occurred when\n\nMs. Cure moved to Lebanon, began living with John Haynes, and required the child to\n\nattend a new school; it further found that these changes were not in the child’s best\n\ninterest. Generally, the trial court found (and expressly stated) that the evidence presented\n\f                                                                                           11\n\nby Mr. Cure and Mr. Gartin was credible, and Ms. Cure’s and Mr. Haynes’s testimony\n\nlacked credibility.\n\n       {¶ 26}    Specifically, the trial court found that Ms. Cure had unresolved anger\n\nmanagement and relationship issues and lacked maturity. The court expressed “genuine\n\nand immediate concern about [the son’s] health and safety” while the son was with Ms.\n\nCure and Mr. Haynes, and observed that Ms. Cure “subordinated her children’s interest in\n\nfavor of her desire to establish a long-term relationship” with Mr. Haynes, which was not\n\nin her son’s best interest. The court noted that Ms. Cure had had “a multitude of failed\n\nrelationships with men,” had introduced many men into her children’s lives, and had\n\n“subjected her children to environments involving disharmony * * * and subsequent failed\n\nrelationships.” The court also noted that the move to Lebanon had made it more difficult\n\nfor the Cures’ son to maintain close relationships with his extended family in Clark\n\nCounty. The court found that Ms. Cure “comes across as arrogant and close-minded\n\n[sic],” and it concluded that she was attentive to her son’s needs only when those needs\n\ndid not “conflict with her personal agendas, such as the establishment of relationships with\n\ndifferent men.” The court concluded that the primary motive for the move was for the\n\nconvenience of Mr. Haynes and “had nothing to do with what was best for this child.”\n\nThe court also observed that Ms. Cure had not complied with the court’s order that her son\n\nshould not be left alone with Mr. Haynes, that she had purposely “segregated” her children\n\nfrom their fathers, and that she “had no intention to communicate or cooperate in the\n\nfuture with Mr. Cure for [their son’s] benefit.”\n\n       {¶ 27}    With regard to Mr. Haynes, the trial court found that he lacked character\n\f                                                                                            12\n\nand had numerous unresolved issues, including anger management issues, anxiety,\n\ndepression, trouble sleeping, post-traumatic stress, dishonesty, and overall behavioral\n\nissues. The court expressed skepticism about the future of Ms. Cure’s relationship with\n\nMr. Haynes, noting that he was still married to someone else.\n\n       {¶ 28}    The trial court found that Mr. Cure had been an active part of his son’s\n\nlife, that his motives in pursuing custody were “well intentioned,” and that the Cures’ son\n\n“has a greater opportunity to develop health[y] relationships with friends, relatives, and\n\nothers while residing with his father, all of which will assist him in his future\n\ndevelopment.” Although the court noted that Mr. Cure had been married and divorced\n\nthree times, it concluded that “credible evidence * * * suggests that his relationship to his\n\ncurrent fiancé who he had resided with for approximately four years is stable and\n\nconsistent.” The court also noted that Mr. Cure had “made significant efforts in life to\n\nbetter himself and to serve as an appropriate role model” for his son, such as earning his\n\nGED and earning a college degree by attending school part-time.\n\n       {¶ 29}    The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding, based on the\n\nevidence presented, that a change of circumstances had occurred that warranted a change\n\nin custody.     Ms. Cure chose a lifestyle wherein she moved from relationship to\n\nrelationship and residence to residence frequently, without any apparent regard for the\n\neffect that this transient lifestyle had on her son’s ability to feel secure and to form\n\nrelationships of his own. Although Ms. Cure believed that she had found “the man of her\n\ndreams” in Mr. Haynes, the trial court had ample reason to be skeptical that the\n\nrelationship would last, based on Ms. Cure’s and Mr. Haynes’s relationship histories, the\n\f                                                                                             13\n\nfact that he was not yet divorced from his previous wife, and Mr. Haynes’s inability, in\n\nparticular, to maintain a monogamous relationship.\n\n       {¶ 30}     The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the\n\nson's best interest would be served by a change of custody and that the benefits of such a\n\nchange outweighed any harm that would be caused by the change. Ms. Cure’s tendency to\n\njump from one relationship to another made it very difficult for her son to maintain his\n\nown friendships at home or at school, and her move to Lebanon, in particular, created\n\nhardship in his visitation with his father and weakened his relationships with extended\n\nfamily on both sides in Clark County. Even more troubling than the moves themselves,\n\nhowever, was Ms. Cure’s complete failure to recognize the adverse effects of her moves\n\nand relationship choices on her son.\n\n       {¶ 31}     Although the trial court discussed the relationships involving the parties\n\nand others, the court’s approval or disapproval of these relationships did not factor into its\n\ndecision; rather, as we have stated, the trial court was concerned with whether there had\n\nbeen a change of circumstances, the best interest of the child, and weighing any harm that\n\nlikely would be caused by a change in the allocation of parental rights.           Mr. Cure\n\ndemonstrated all of the factors necessary to support a reallocation of parental rights, and\n\nthe trial court did not err in granting his motion.\n\n       {¶ 32}     The first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n                                  The Finding of Contempt\n\n       {¶ 33}     Ms. Cure’s third assignment of error states:\n\n       The trial court erred by finding appellant in contempt of court.\n\f                                                                                             14\n\n        {¶ 34}    Ms. Cure argues that the trial court erred in finding her in contempt of its\n\norder that the Cures' son should not be left with Mr. Haynes unsupervised, because she did\n\nnot violate the court’s order “in spirit.”\n\n        {¶ 35}    An appellate court will not reverse a finding of contempt unless the trial\n\ncourt has abused its discretion. Ahmed v. Ahmed, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23740,\n\n2010-Ohio-5635, ¶ 36.\n\n        {¶ 36}    Evidence was presented at the hearing about several specific instances in\n\nwhich Ms. Cure allowed either her son or her daughter to be alone with Mr. Haynes; two\n\nincidents related to the daughter, and two related to the son. (The court had also imposed a\n\nrestriction on Ms. Cure’s daughter being with Mr. Haynes unsupervised, and Mr. Gartin\n\nalso filed a motion for contempt.) With respect to the Cures’ son, the first instance\n\noccurred when Mr. Haynes sat in a car outside a doctor’s office with the Cures’ son while\n\nMs. Cure, Mr. Gartin, and their daughter attended a therapy session inside the building.\n\nMr. Haynes and Ms. Cure did not believe that this incident violated the court’s order\n\nbecause Ms. Cure was nearby. The second incident occurred the morning of one of the\n\nhearing dates. The Cures’ son had been hit in the mouth with a bat the night before and\n\nneeded to go to the dentist; Ms. Cure claimed that she was unable to take him to the dentist\n\nherself because of the hearing, that she was unable to get in touch with Mr. Cure, and that\n\nno one else was available, so Mr. Haynes took the child to the dentist. Mr. Cure denied\n\nthat Ms. Cure had made a genuine effort to contact him and that Mr. Haynes had been the\n\nonly available option.\n\n        {¶ 37}    Ms. Cure did not deny that there had been instances in which Mr. Haynes\n\f                                                                                             15\n\nwas alone with her son after the court had prohibited such conduct; in her opinion, the\n\nconduct had either been necessary (the dentist appointment) or had technically complied\n\nwith the court's order because she had been close-by (the therapist appointment). It was\n\nfor the trial court to determine whether, in fact, either of these violations of its order had\n\nbeen justified by the surrounding circumstances. We cannot conclude that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion in concluding that they had not.\n\n       {¶ 38}    The third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       {¶ 39}    The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\n                                        ..........\n\nFAIN, J. and CANNON, J., concur.\n\n(Hon.

Cure appeals from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court\n\f                                                                                                2\n\nof Clark County, Domestic Relations Division, which granted Andrew Cure’s motion for a\n\nreallocation of parental rights of their minor son, named Mr. Cure as the residential parent,\n\nfound Ms. Cure in contempt of court, and imposed a suspended sentence on the condition\n\nthat Ms. Cure comply with the court’s orders in the future.\n\n       {¶ 2}     For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in modifying the Cures’ parental rights or in finding Ms. Cure in\n\ncontempt.\n\n                                Facts & Procedural History\n\n       {¶ 3}     The Cures were married for less than three years and were separated\n\nmultiple times before their divorce in 2008. They had one son, who was born prior to\n\ntheir marriage and was five years old at the time of the divorce. Pursuant to the divorce\n\ndecree, Ms. Cure was named as the residential parent, and Mr. Cure was awarded\n\nvisitation. After the divorce, the parties lived near one another in Clark County. Ms.\n\nCure was also the residential parent of another child, a daughter from a previous marriage;\n\nthe daughter’s father also had visitation and lived nearby.\n\n       {¶ 4}     In June 2011, Ms. Cure moved to a home she had recently purchased in\n\nLebanon, Ohio. She lived there with her boyfriend, John Haynes, who was a Hamilton\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Deputy and was required to live within 30 miles of the Hamilton County\n\nJustice Center. At the time of Ms. Cure’s move, Mr. Haynes was married to Stacy\n\nHaynes, and no complaint for divorce had been filed. Ms. Cure’s residence in Lebanon\n\nwas more than an hour away from Mr. Cure’s residence, which made it difficult for him to\n\nexercise his mid-week visitation with their son, who was 8 years old.\n\f                                                                                               3\n\n        {¶ 5}     Mr. Cure filed motions for reallocation of parental rights and to show\n\ncause why Ms. Cure should not be held in contempt. The motion for reallocation of\n\nparental rights focused on the instability created by Ms. Cure’s dating habits and Mr.\n\nCure’s concern about his son’s exposure to Mr. Haynes; while the motion was pending,\n\nthe court ordered that Mr. Haynes should not spend any unsupervised time alone with the\n\nchild. The motion for a finding of contempt initially focused on Ms. Cure’s failure to\n\ninform Mr. Cure of the move, but, as the case unfolded, the court also considered Mr.\n\nCure’s claim that Ms. Cure was in contempt for allowing their son to be alone with Mr.\n\nHaynes, contrary to the court’s interim order. Brian Gartin, the father of Ms. Cure’s\n\ndaughter, also filed a motion for reallocation of parental rights (Case No. 02-DS-0077).\n\nBy agreement of the parties, the motions of Mr. Cure and Mr. Gartin were heard together\n\nby the trial court.\n\n        {¶ 6}     The court held a hearing on August 2, 4, 16 and 18, 2011. The trial court\n\ngranted Mr. Cure’s motion for reallocation of parental rights, named Mr. Cure the\n\nresidential parent, set visitation for Ms. Cure, and ordered Ms. Cure to pay child support.\n\n It also found Ms. Cure in contempt of court for permitting the Cures’ son to be in the\n\npresence of Mr. Haynes, unsupervised. The court imposed a 30-day jail sentence for the\n\ncontempt, but suspended the sentence on the condition that Ms. Cure comply with the\n\ncourt’s continuing order that the child not be left alone with Mr. Haynes. Mr. Gartin’s\n\nmotions for reallocation of parental rights and for a finding of contempt were also granted,\n\nbut those judgments are not relevant to this appeal.\n\n        {¶ 7}     Ms. Cure appeals, raising three assignments of error.      The first two\n\f                                                                                                4\n\nassignments relate to separate prongs of the standard for reallocation of parental rights; as\n\nsuch, we will address them together.\n\n                              Reallocation of Parental Rights\n\n       {¶ 8}      Ms. Cure’s first and second assignments of error state:\n\n                The trial court abused its discretion in finding that there was a\n\n       substantive change of circumstances.\n\n                The trial court next abused its discretion in finding that there\n\n       was a substantial change of circumstances and it would be in the best\n\n       interest of the child to reallocate custody.\n\n         {¶ 9} Ms. Cure argues that the trial court did not properly find a change of\n\n  circumstances or that it would be in the best interest of the child to change custody, as\n\n  required to reallocate parental rights.\n\n         A. Standard of Review\n\n         {¶ 10}          In order to prevail on a motion for reallocation of parental rights,\n\n  the movant must demonstrate that (1) there has been a change in the circumstances of\n\n  the child or the residential parent, (2) modification of the existing custody decree is\n\n  necessary to serve the child’s best interest, and (3) the harm likely to be caused to the\n\n  child by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of\n\n  environment.

Montgomery No. 24640, 2011-Ohio-4460, ¶ 7.\n\n       B. Evidence Presented at the Hearing\n\n       {¶ 12}    Ms. Cure’s testimony at the hearing established that she had been\n\nromantically involved and had lived with several men during her son’s life other than his\n\nfather, that she had lived with her son at five different residences, and that her son had\n\nattended three different schools between kindergarten and third grade.    She claimed that\n\nshe and Mr. Haynes were engaged to be married and that he was the “man of her dreams.”\n\nShe also expressed her belief that her move to Lebanon was good for her son because\n\nLebanon’s school district was better than their previous school district. She believed,\n\nwithout reservation, that she was “the better parent” and the “most stable parent” for her\n\nson.\n\n       {¶ 13}    Ms. Cure’s boyfriend, Mr. Haynes, testified about his close relationship\n\nwith Ms. Cure, his belief that they would stay together long-term, and the close\n\nrelationship that he and Ms. Cure have with one another’s children.           However, he\n\ncontradicted Ms. Cure’s claim that they were engaged, pointing out that he was still\n\nmarried; he also claimed that he did not want to marry Ms. Cure until he could afford to\n\npay for the wedding and a ring himself, because she had paid for her previous wedding.\n\f                                                                                               6\n\n       {¶ 14}    Mr. Haynes also testified about his employment with the Hamilton\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Department, which requires him to live within 30 miles of the Hamilton\n\nCounty Justice Center in downtown Cincinnati. (Ms. Cure’s house in Lebanon is within\n\nthis distance, but her residence in Clark County was not.) Mr. Haynes testified that he\n\nworks on the bomb squad and that his skills were not easily transferrable to other sheriffs’\n\nor police departments, because most departments do not maintain their own bomb squad.\n\nWhen asked about disciplinary and legal issues related to his employment, Mr. Haynes\n\nadmitted involvement in an incident for which he was disciplined and was being sued; the\n\nincident involved the excessive use of force against a motorist who was tazed and\n\nforcefully removed from a car while having a diabetic seizure, resulting in injury to the\n\nmotorist.   Mr. Haynes denied that there were other disciplinary issues related to his\n\nemployment and that other deputies were reluctant to work with him because of the\n\nlikelihood of a lawsuit arising from his behavior.\n\n       {¶ 15}    Mr. Haynes’s wife, Stacy, also testified; at the time of the hearing, the\n\nHayneses were in the process of divorcing after 18 years of marriage. Mr. and Mrs.\n\nHaynes testified at length about events that occurred during the months preceding their\n\nseparation, and their testimony was often in conflict. For example, Mr. Haynes claimed\n\nthat he had moved into the basement and that he and his wife had been living “separately”\n\nbeginning in early 2010; thereafter, he had an affair with a fellow police officer, and then\n\nbegan his relationship with Ms. Cure in the spring of 2010. Mrs. Haynes testified,\n\nhowever, that Mr. Haynes never moved into their basement, that she was unaware of\n\nproblems in their marriage until May 2010, around Mother’s Day, when the officer\n\f                                                                                              7\n\ninvolved with Mr. Haynes came to their home, and that, although they were separated, she\n\n(Mrs. Haynes) and Mr. Haynes continued to work on reconciling throughout the summer\n\nof 2010. By this time, however, Ms. Cure had purchased the house in Lebanon, and Mr.\n\nHaynes was living there. Also, in the summer of 2010, Mr. Haynes paid $1,800 toward\n\nthe mortgage and utilities at Ms. Cure’s new home in Lebanon, while he was in arrears on\n\nhis spousal support and child support payments to Mrs. Haynes. Mrs. Haynes had two\n\nyoung children and was not employed outside the home, and the Hayneses’ house ended\n\nup in foreclosure; notwithstanding the court-ordered support, Mr. Haynes believed that\n\nMrs. Haynes should have gotten a job to help with the house payments and her other\n\nexpenses.\n\n       {¶ 16}    According to Mrs. Haynes, Mr. Haynes masturbated while looking at\n\npornography on their home computer with their young children nearby; he did not think\n\nthis behavior was problematic, because he did not think the children were capable of\n\nunderstanding it. Mr. Haynes stored pornographic pictures on the computer, including,\n\nMrs. Haynes eventually discovered, pictures of himself engaged in sexual activities with\n\nother women; in one of these pictures, he was wearing a blue wristband issued to Mr. and\n\nMrs. Haynes while she was in the hospital when their twins were born. Mr. Haynes\n\ndenied that he was the man in any of the pornographic pictures on the computer. Mr.\n\nHaynes admitted that he had had sexual relations with one of his girlfriends, the police\n\nofficer, at the marital home before he was separated from Mrs. Haynes.\n\n       {¶ 17}    Mr. Haynes claimed that his frequent visits to pornographic websites and,\n\nparticularly, websites of escort services, were related to his employment, through which he\n\f                                                                                                8\n\nwas responsible for identifying and arresting prostitutes; although some of the escort\n\nservices operated outside of his jurisdiction, he claimed that they bordered on his\n\njurisdiction. He also claimed that his practice of masturbating to pornography was related\n\nto his wife’s infertility treatments, for which he was required to collect semen, but Mrs.\n\nHaynes testified that the infertility treatments did not require Mr. Haynes to collect semen\n\nat home. At one point in his testimony, Mr. Haynes admitted to having had one to ten\n\naffairs during his marriage, although his testimony established at least two affairs – with a\n\nfellow officer and Ms. Cure – toward the end of his marriage; at another point, he stated\n\nthat he told Ms. Cure of five affairs during his marriage and that, in his deposition, he\n\n“guess[ed] it could have been” 200. Mr. Haynes also admitted that he had been alone\n\nwith Ms. Cure’s son and daughter in recent months, notwithstanding the court’s order that\n\nany time he spent with them should be supervised. He believed that, because Ms. Cure\n\nhad been close-by, his conduct had not violated the order.\n\n       {¶ 18}    Mrs. Haynes described Mr. Haynes as exhibiting unreasonable or\n\nirrational behavior and stated that, although he could be “wonderful” 95% of the time, the\n\nother 5% was “so bad that it invaded [her] whole existence.” She testified that he used\n\nprofanity toward their children (twins, who were age three at the time of the hearing), and\n\nthat he had in the past forced food into the children’s mouths that was either too hot or too\n\nlarge or thick for them to safely eat. She did not believe, however, that he was a danger to\n\nher own children or to Ms. Cure’s children.\n\n       {¶ 19}    Mr. Cure testified that he had resided with his fiancee, Mirandia McCoy,\n\nfor four years, and that he had never cheated on her or separated from her during that time.\n\f                                                                                                9\n\n He described being active in his son’s sports, school conferences, and doctor’s\n\nappointments, stated that his son has good friends in the neighborhood, and that his son\n\nwas well-adjusted.\n\n        {¶ 20}   Mr. Cure testified that Ms. Cure’s move to Lebanon made it very difficult\n\nfor him to exercise his mid-week visitation, because the length of the drive (one hour and\n\n15 minutes each way) and the son’s need to be at school early the next day made it very\n\ntiring for his son to come to his house on a weeknight. For this reason, Mr. Cure had not\n\nbeen taking his son to his Clark County home for mid-week visitation since Ms. Cure’s\n\nmove.\n\n        {¶ 21}   With respect to Ms. Cure, Mr. Cure expressed concern about the “lack of\n\ncontinuity” in his son’s life while living with Ms. Cure, because his son had experienced\n\nfour moves and three schools in a four-year period. He also expressed his belief that this\n\npattern would continue and that the “volatility * * * is going to blow up on” his son. He\n\nclaimed that both Ms. Cure and Mr. Haynes had volatile personalities, and he expressed\n\ndispleasure that Ms. Cure introduces their son to the men she is dating within weeks of the\n\nstart of the relationship, and even moves in with them. Mr. Cure testified that his son is\n\n“leery” and “afraid” of his mom sometimes, because of her yelling and his fear of getting\n\nin trouble.   Mr. Cure also stated that Ms. Cure is not forthcoming with him about\n\ninformation regarding their son, such as health issues, and that she does not promote a\n\npositive relationship between father and son.\n\n        {¶ 22}   Mr. Cure admitted that, on one occasion when Ms. Cure’s older daughter\n\nwas at their home, he held the girl by the face to get her attention, which apparently scared\n\f                                                                                            10\n\nthe child and was a memorable event for her. Mr. Cure stated that he felt badly that the\n\nincident had scared the girl, but he had seen Ms. Cure do the same thing and believed it\n\nwas a way to get the child to listen to him.\n\n       {¶ 23}    Ms. Cure denied that Mr. Cure was active in their son’s life, and claimed\n\nthat he only visited with their son 70-80% of the time that he was entitled to do so. She\n\nalso testified to her belief that Mr. Cure frequently leaves their son with Mr. Cure’s mother\n\n(the son’s grandmother) during his visitation.\n\n       {¶ 24}    The trial court also considered the report of the guardian ad litem, but the\n\nguardian ad litem did not testify at the hearing. In his report, the guardian ad litem\n\nrecognized that Ms. Cure’s choices in relationships “have not always been good” and that\n\nit would have been more reasonable for her to proceed more slowly in her relationship\n\nwith Mr. Haynes. He also stated that Ms. Cure “see[s] the existence of the children’s\n\nfathers as a nuisance,” whereas the guardian ad litem believed that the fathers were\n\n“primarily motivated by genuine concerns” for the children. The guardian ad litem did\n\nnot believe that Mr. Haynes posed a danger to the Cures’ son. The guardian ad litem\n\nconcluded that Ms. Cure’s move to Lebanon had not “created a change of circumstances of\n\nsubstance” and that she should remain the residential parent.\n\n       C. The Trial Court’s Decision\n\n       {¶ 25}    The trial court found that a change of circumstances had occurred when\n\nMs. Cure moved to Lebanon, began living with John Haynes, and required the child to\n\nattend a new school; it further found that these changes were not in the child’s best\n\ninterest. Generally, the trial court found (and expressly stated) that the evidence presented\n\f                                                                                           11\n\nby Mr. Cure and Mr. Gartin was credible, and Ms. Cure’s and Mr. Haynes’s testimony\n\nlacked credibility.\n\n       {¶ 26}    Specifically, the trial court found that Ms. Cure had unresolved anger\n\nmanagement and relationship issues and lacked maturity. The court expressed “genuine\n\nand immediate concern about [the son’s] health and safety” while the son was with Ms.\n\nCure and Mr. Haynes, and observed that Ms. Cure “subordinated her children’s interest in\n\nfavor of her desire to establish a long-term relationship” with Mr. Haynes, which was not\n\nin her son’s best interest. The court noted that Ms. Cure had had “a multitude of failed\n\nrelationships with men,” had introduced many men into her children’s lives, and had\n\n“subjected her children to environments involving disharmony * * * and subsequent failed\n\nrelationships.” The court also noted that the move to Lebanon had made it more difficult\n\nfor the Cures’ son to maintain close relationships with his extended family in Clark\n\nCounty. The court found that Ms. Cure “comes across as arrogant and close-minded\n\n[sic],” and it concluded that she was attentive to her son’s needs only when those needs\n\ndid not “conflict with her personal agendas, such as the establishment of relationships with\n\ndifferent men.” The court concluded that the primary motive for the move was for the\n\nconvenience of Mr. Haynes and “had nothing to do with what was best for this child.”\n\nThe court also observed that Ms. Cure had not complied with the court’s order that her son\n\nshould not be left alone with Mr. Haynes, that she had purposely “segregated” her children\n\nfrom their fathers, and that she “had no intention to communicate or cooperate in the\n\nfuture with Mr. Cure for [their son’s] benefit.”\n\n       {¶ 27}    With regard to Mr. Haynes, the trial court found that he lacked character\n\f                                                                                            12\n\nand had numerous unresolved issues, including anger management issues, anxiety,\n\ndepression, trouble sleeping, post-traumatic stress, dishonesty, and overall behavioral\n\nissues. The court expressed skepticism about the future of Ms. Cure’s relationship with\n\nMr. Haynes, noting that he was still married to someone else.\n\n       {¶ 28}    The trial court found that Mr. Cure had been an active part of his son’s\n\nlife, that his motives in pursuing custody were “well intentioned,” and that the Cures’ son\n\n“has a greater opportunity to develop health[y] relationships with friends, relatives, and\n\nothers while residing with his father, all of which will assist him in his future\n\ndevelopment.” Although the court noted that Mr. Cure had been married and divorced\n\nthree times, it concluded that “credible evidence * * * suggests that his relationship to his\n\ncurrent fiancé who he had resided with for approximately four years is stable and\n\nconsistent.” The court also noted that Mr. Cure had “made significant efforts in life to\n\nbetter himself and to serve as an appropriate role model” for his son, such as earning his\n\nGED and earning a college degree by attending school part-time.\n\n       {¶ 29}    The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding, based on the\n\nevidence presented, that a change of circumstances had occurred that warranted a change\n\nin custody.     Ms. Cure chose a lifestyle wherein she moved from relationship to\n\nrelationship and residence to residence frequently, without any apparent regard for the\n\neffect that this transient lifestyle had on her son’s ability to feel secure and to form\n\nrelationships of his own. Although Ms. Cure believed that she had found “the man of her\n\ndreams” in Mr. Haynes, the trial court had ample reason to be skeptical that the\n\nrelationship would last, based on Ms. Cure’s and Mr. Haynes’s relationship histories, the\n\f                                                                                             13\n\nfact that he was not yet divorced from his previous wife, and Mr. Haynes’s inability, in\n\nparticular, to maintain a monogamous relationship.\n\n       {¶ 30}     The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the\n\nson's best interest would be served by a change of custody and that the benefits of such a\n\nchange outweighed any harm that would be caused by the change. Ms. Cure’s tendency to\n\njump from one relationship to another made it very difficult for her son to maintain his\n\nown friendships at home or at school, and her move to Lebanon, in particular, created\n\nhardship in his visitation with his father and weakened his relationships with extended\n\nfamily on both sides in Clark County. Even more troubling than the moves themselves,\n\nhowever, was Ms. Cure’s complete failure to recognize the adverse effects of her moves\n\nand relationship choices on her son.\n\n       {¶ 31}     Although the trial court discussed the relationships involving the parties\n\nand others, the court’s approval or disapproval of these relationships did not factor into its\n\ndecision; rather, as we have stated, the trial court was concerned with whether there had\n\nbeen a change of circumstances, the best interest of the child, and weighing any harm that\n\nlikely would be caused by a change in the allocation of parental rights.           Mr. Cure\n\ndemonstrated all of the factors necessary to support a reallocation of parental rights, and\n\nthe trial court did not err in granting his motion.\n\n       {¶ 32}     The first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n                                  The Finding of Contempt\n\n       {¶ 33}     Ms. Cure’s third assignment of error states:\n\n       The trial court erred by finding appellant in contempt of court.\n\f                                                                                             14\n\n        {¶ 34}    Ms. Cure argues that the trial court erred in finding her in contempt of its\n\norder that the Cures' son should not be left with Mr. Haynes unsupervised, because she did\n\nnot violate the court’s order “in spirit.”\n\n        {¶ 35}    An appellate court will not reverse a finding of contempt unless the trial\n\ncourt has abused its discretion. Ahmed v. Ahmed, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23740,\n\n2010-Ohio-5635, ¶ 36.\n\n        {¶ 36}    Evidence was presented at the hearing about several specific instances in\n\nwhich Ms. Cure allowed either her son or her daughter to be alone with Mr. Haynes; two\n\nincidents related to the daughter, and two related to the son. (The court had also imposed a\n\nrestriction on Ms. Cure’s daughter being with Mr. Haynes unsupervised, and Mr. Gartin\n\nalso filed a motion for contempt.) With respect to the Cures’ son, the first instance\n\noccurred when Mr. Haynes sat in a car outside a doctor’s office with the Cures’ son while\n\nMs. Cure, Mr. Gartin, and their daughter attended a therapy session inside the building.\n\nMr. Haynes and Ms. Cure did not believe that this incident violated the court’s order\n\nbecause Ms. Cure was nearby. The second incident occurred the morning of one of the\n\nhearing dates. The Cures’ son had been hit in the mouth with a bat the night before and\n\nneeded to go to the dentist; Ms. Cure claimed that she was unable to take him to the dentist\n\nherself because of the hearing, that she was unable to get in touch with Mr. Cure, and that\n\nno one else was available, so Mr. Haynes took the child to the dentist. Mr. Cure denied\n\nthat Ms. Cure had made a genuine effort to contact him and that Mr. Haynes had been the\n\nonly available option.\n\n        {¶ 37}    Ms. Cure did not deny that there had been instances in which Mr. Haynes\n\f                                                                                             15\n\nwas alone with her son after the court had prohibited such conduct; in her opinion, the\n\nconduct had either been necessary (the dentist appointment) or had technically complied\n\nwith the court's order because she had been close-by (the therapist appointment). It was\n\nfor the trial court to determine whether, in fact, either of these violations of its order had\n\nbeen justified by the surrounding circumstances. We cannot conclude that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion in concluding that they had not.\n\n       {¶ 38}    The third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       {¶ 39}    The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\n                                        ..........\n\nFAIN, J. and CANNON, J., concur.\n\n(Hon.
