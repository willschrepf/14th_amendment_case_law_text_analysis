In short, by December 31, 1984, Jim Davis Auctioneers,\r\nInc. (\"JDA\") had collected $190,737.12 in sales taxes; of this amount, state sales taxes totaled\r\n$134,350.43, city sales taxes totaled $28,914.43, and transit authority sales taxes totaled\r\n$27,472.26.  Davis was president and director of JDA throughout the time period at issue; he\r\ncontrolled both the management and financial affairs of JDA.  Davis, or those answerable to him,\r\ncommingled the tax receipts into JDA's operating account and paid out the funds to entities other\r\nthan appellees.  To date, no sales taxes JDA collected have been remitted to appellees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Comptroller certified the delinquent amounts to the Attorney General for\r\ncollection.  Based on the certification, appellees filed suit on July 12, 1989.<strong><sup> (1)</sup></strong>  The issues to be\r\ndetermined at trial were Davis's alleged conversion of the sales tax receipts and his liability under\r\nsection 111.016 of the Tax Code.  The trial court rendered judgment in favor of appellees on\r\nDecember 8, 1993.  Davis appeals the trial court's judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>I.\tJurisdiction</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAt the outset, we address appellees' jurisdictional cross point of error by which\r\nthey contend this Court erred in denying their motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction because\r\nDavis did not timely perfect his appeal.  To perfect his appeal, Davis did not file security for costs\r\nwithin thirty days of the signing of the trial court's judgment.  Instead, he timely requested\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law from the trial court and thereafter filed a cost bond within\r\nninety days after the judgment was signed.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 41(a)(1) (extending deadline for\r\nperfecting appeal from thirty to ninety days after judgment is signed when findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law are timely requested following non-jury trial).  Appellees argue that Davis's\r\nrequest for findings of fact and conclusions of law failed to extend the deadline to perfect an\r\nappeal because findings of fact and conclusions of law are (1) unwarranted unless a trial has taken\r\nplace and (2) inappropriate in an agreed case.  We will address each argument in turn.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>\tA.\tTrial</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>    \tAppellees remind us that parties may request findings of fact and conclusions of\r\nlaw only in cases tried without a jury.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 296.  Appellees place much emphasis\r\non the word \"tried\":  they argue that a proceeding based on stipulated evidence, like that in the\r\ninstant case, cannot be characterized as a \"trial\" within the meaning of Rule 296, and assert that\r\nany request for findings of fact and conclusions of law stemming from such a proceeding therefore\r\ndoes not extend deadlines for perfecting an appeal.  We disagree.  The \"trial\" envisioned by Rule\r\n296 is an evidentiary hearing to the court <em>or</em> a bench trial on the merits.  <em>Zimmerman v. Robinson</em>,\r\n862 S.W.2d 162, 164 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1993, no writ).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>    \tIn the instant cause, the factual evidence was orally stipulated in proceedings before\r\nthe trial court.  One exhibit was introduced and offered into evidence.  The trial court\r\nsubsequently rendered judgment.  We conclude that the instant case was \"tried . . . without a\r\njury\" as required by Rule 296; a bench trial on the merits took place regardless of whether the\r\ncourt received only stipulated evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>\tB.\tAgreed Case</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the proceedings constituted a nonjury trial, we generally would conclude\r\nthat the timely filing of a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law extended the deadline\r\nto perfect an appeal to ninety days after the judgment was signed.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 41(a)(1). \r\nHowever, appellees argue that we should treat the instant cause as an \"Agreed Case\" under Texas\r\nRule of Civil Procedure 263<strong><sup> (2)</sup></strong> and hold that a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law\r\nis inappropriate and cannot extend the appellate timeline.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo qualify as an agreed case, an agreed statement of facts upon which judgment\r\nshall be rendered must be filed with the court clerk.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 263.<strong><sup> (3)</sup></strong>  The parties in this\r\ncause did not strictly comply with Rule 263.  However, appellees maintain that \"[i]f the parties\r\nstipulate all the facts of an action, . . . the stipulation <em>may be treated as a submission upon an\r\nagreed statement [pursuant to Rule 263]</em>.\"  <em>Lambda Constr. Co. v. Chamberlin Waterproofing &amp;\r\nRoofing Sys., Inc.</em>, 784 S.W.2d 122, 125 (Tex. App.--Austin 1990, writ denied); <em>see also</em> <em>Cobb\r\nv. Harrington</em>, 190 S.W.2d 709, 715 (Tex. 1945) (treating case submitted on stipulation so\r\ncomplete that \"it shows what the controversy between the parties is, and the facts out of which\r\nthe controversy arose, and leaves nothing for the court but to declare the law arising from the\r\nfacts\" as agreed case).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDavis has not challenged appellees' assertion that the instant cause be treated as an\r\nagreed case.  Although the parties never agreed that the case would be tried pursuant to Rule 263\r\nas an agreed case, neither did they imply that there were other facts as to which they would offer\r\nproof if they so desired.  The issues at trial were limited to the application of the law to the\r\nstipulated facts.  In considering all the facts, circumstances, and actions of the parties, we\r\nconclude that while not in literal compliance with Rule 263, the instant case may be treated as an\r\nagreed case for the purposes of determining the appropriateness of the request for findings of fact\r\nand conclusions of law.  <em>See Cobb</em>, 190 S.W.2d at 715; <em>Lambda Constr.</em>, 784 S.W.2d at 125.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>\tC.\tAppropriateness of Request for Findings of Fact</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOrdinarily,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>[t]he <em>courts are without power</em>, in the absence of a provision in the agreed\r\nstatement providing otherwise, <em>to draw any inference, or find any facts, not\r\nembraced in the agreement</em>, unless, as a matter of law, such other inferences are\r\nnecessarily compelled; and the judgment of the court must only declare the law\r\nwhich necessarily arises from the facts agreed upon.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Hutcherson v.

App.--Amarillo 1931, writ ref'd)\r\n(on rehearing) (confining trial court to facts contained in agreed statement and allowing no\r\nadditional findings).  Accordingly, findings of fact and conclusions of law <em>need not</em> be filed\r\nfollowing a judgment rendered on stipulated facts.  <em>Sharyland Water Supply Corp. v.

(concluding trial court correctly refused to\r\nmake findings of fact in administrative law case because only questions of law were presented);\r\n<em>Southwest Stone Co. v.

(holding trial court properly refused to make findings of facts in case disposed\r\nof by sustaining special exceptions to pleadings because pleadings stated all facts upon which trial\r\ncourt ruled).  If findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed in agreed cases, they will be\r\ndisregarded on appeal.  <em>Cf. Cobb</em>, 190 S.W.2d at 715 (stating agreed statement of facts and\r\njudgment constitute record on appeal of agreed case); <em>Ocean Accident</em>, 291 S.W. at 278 (stating\r\nfindings of fact in agreed case not binding on appeal).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the context of summary judgment, the Texas Supreme Court recently held that\r\na request for findings of fact and conclusions of law will not extend the appellate timetable\r\n\"[b]ecause findings of fact and conclusions of law <em>have no place</em> in a summary judgment\r\nproceeding.\"  <em>Linwood v. NCNB Tex.</em>, 885 S.W.2d 102, 103 (Tex. 1994) (emphasis added).  Our\r\nreading of Texas case law indicates that, as in the context of summary judgment, findings of fact\r\ngenerally <em>have no place </em>in cases based entirely on undisputed stipulated facts.  <em>See Perry</em>, 380\r\nS.W.2d at 875.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, while findings of fact may ordinarily be inappropriate in agreed\r\ncases, at times inferential findings beyond the agreed or stipulated facts may be necessarily\r\ncompelled by the facts as a matter of law.  <em>See Abilene Hotel Corp. v. Gill</em>, 187 S.W.2d 708, 712-13 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1945, writ ref'd w.o.m.) (on rehearing) (positing that when agreed facts\r\nare evidentiary in nature as to an ultimate material issue, the parties intend, and in effect agree,\r\nthat trial court make findings raised by evidence in stipulated facts in order to make conclusion\r\non controlling issue); <em>see also Hutcherson</em>, 251 S.W. at 492 (providing exception for court's lack\r\nof power to find facts in agreed cases when other inferences are compelled as a matter of law). \r\nWe conclude that because findings of fact may be necessarily compelled by stipulated facts that\r\nare evidentiary in nature, they will not be disregarded in every instance.  <em>See Abilene Hotel</em>, 187\r\nS.W.2d at 712-13 (assuming in absence of trial court's express findings of fact that trial court\r\nfound all facts raised by evidence contained in agreed statement in support of judgment).  We\r\ntherefore distinguish the role of findings of fact and conclusions of law in agreed cases where\r\nfindings <em>generally</em> have no place from that in summary judgment cases where findings\r\n<em>unqualifiedly</em> have no place.  <em>See Linwood</em>, 885 S.W.2d at 103.  We hold that while findings of\r\nfact need not be filed in agreed cases, they may be necessary in some rare instances. However,\r\nwe cannot determine whether findings of fact and conclusions of law are necessary until we have\r\njurisdiction over the cause.  Accordingly, since findings of fact and conclusions of law are not\r\nalways inappropriate, we conclude that a request for such extends the timetable to perfect appeals\r\nin all agreed cases.  Appellees' jurisdictional cross-point of error is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>II.  Sales Taxes</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDavis contends in his second point of error that the trial court erred in applying\r\nsection 111.016 of the Tax Code (\"section 111.016\"), as amended effective July 21, 1987, to hold\r\nhim liable for taxes collected by JDA in 1984 because (1) the amended statute imposes a different\r\nduty and status on a taxpayer corporation than the 1984 statute and (2) the application of the\r\namended statute to Davis gives it a constitutionally prohibited retroactive effect.<strong><sup> (4)</sup></strong></span><span>  Davis\r\nacknowledges that section 111.016, as amended in 1987, sets forth a fiduciary relationship\r\nbetween the state and entities, like JDA, authorized to collect sales taxes on behalf of the state,\r\nin which the sales tax collector holds tax receipts, the state's property, in trust for the state.  <em>See\r\nDixon v. State</em>, 808 S.W.2d 721, 723 (Tex. App.--Austin 1991, writ dism'd w.o.j.).  Before the\r\n1987 amendment, however, Davis contends that section 111.016 did not mandate a trust\r\nrelationship but rather provided for a debtor-creditor relationship between the state and sales tax\r\ncollectors.  Davis cites no authority in support of this position.  Yet, he argues sales taxes\r\ncollected before 1987 did not become state property until remitted to the state.  Davis maintains\r\nthat he cannot be liable on theories of conversion or breach of fiduciary duty when appellees had\r\nno ownership interest in the taxes JDA collected in 1984.  To hold him liable for either tort, Davis\r\nargues the trial court retroactively applied amended section 111.016 to him in contravention of\r\nArticle I, section 16 of the Texas Constitution and section 311.022 of the Code Construction Act.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn response, appellees contend that even in 1984 when JDA collected the sales taxes\r\nat issue, the pre-amendment form of section 111.016 set forth a trust relationship between the state\r\nand sales tax collectors with respect to sales tax funds collected.<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong>  As such, they contend JDA's\r\nfailure to remit the receipts constituted the tort of conversion for which Davis can be held jointly\r\nliable with JDA.  <em>See id</em>. at 723-24.  Appellees argue that the amendment's scant legislative\r\nhistory suggests its purpose was to clarify existing law.  In addition, appellees suggest that the\r\nstructure of the Texas sales tax system establishes an agency relationship imposing duties on the\r\nagent tax collector with respect to the principal's--the state's--property.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNo Texas case law addresses the relationship section 111.016 imposed on sales tax\r\ncollectors and the state as to sales taxes collected before 1987.  Moreover, the parties indicate that\r\nno legislative history is available to shed light on the meaning of the 1987 amendment to section\r\n111.016.  However, observing that section 111.016, located under the Tax Code chapter entitled\r\n\"Collection Procedures,\" applies generally to all taxes imposed by the Tax Code, we logically\r\nlook to the specific portions of the Tax Code imposing the sales tax and detailing the sales tax\r\nscheme and manner of payment for guidance as to the relationship existing between the state and\r\nsales tax collectors both before and after the 1987 amendment to section 111.016.  <em>See </em>Limited\r\nSales, Excise, and Use Tax Act, Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§151.001-.801 (West 1992 &amp; Supp. 1995)\r\n(the \"Act\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEnacted in 1961 when Texas \"fac[ed] the greatest financial crisis in its history,\"\r\nthe sales tax was imposed to raise revenue to be used by the state for the health and welfare of all\r\nTexans.  Limited Sales, Excise and Use Tax Act, 57th Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 24, art. VIII, § 4, 1961\r\nTex. Gen. Laws 71, 114.  An excise tax,<strong><sup> (6)</sup></strong> the sales tax is characterized as a transaction tax\r\nimposed on each sale of a taxable item.  Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 151.051 (West 1992); <em>Calvert v.\r\nCanteen Co.</em>, 371 S.W.2d 556, 558 (Tex. 1963).  The seller must collect the sales tax by adding\r\nthe tax to the sales price of the taxable item; the tax is the purchaser's debt to the seller until paid. \r\nTex. Tax Code Ann. § 151.052(a)(1), (2) (West 1992).  Generally, sales taxes are due to the\r\ncomptroller quarterly or on or before the twentieth day of the month.  <em>Id</em>. § 151.401(b) (West\r\nSupp. 1995).  Sales taxes paid to the state by the seller are computed based on the application of\r\nthe sales tax rate to the total receipts of taxable sales and services collected from the purchaser. \r\n<em>Id</em>. § 151.410 (West 1992).  However, the taxpayer may deduct a percentage of the tax amount\r\ndue as reimbursement for the cost of collecting the taxes.  <em>Id</em>. § 151.423.  Persons failing to report\r\nor pay taxes imposed may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.  <em>See id</em>. §§ 151.703, .7031,\r\n.709 (West 1992 &amp; Supp. 1995).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhile sellers have a legal duty to collect sales taxes from purchasers, both sellers\r\nand purchasers are liable to the state for sales taxes.  <em>Bullock v. Foley Bros. Dry Goods Corp.</em>,\r\n802 S.W.2d 835, 838 (Tex. App.--Austin 1990, writ denied) (\"[T]he tax may be collected [by the\r\ncomptroller] from the seller or purchaser or both until the tax has been paid . . . .\"); <em>Bullock v.\r\nDelta Indus. Constr. Co.</em>, 668 S.W.2d 502, 504 (Tex. App.--Austin 1984, no writ) (upholding\r\nauthority of state to collect sales tax from purchaser when sellers defaulted on obligations to\r\ncollect sales tax from purchaser); <em>see also</em> Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 151.417 (West 1992) (providing\r\nfor direct payment of sales tax by purchaser under some circumstances).  Both sellers and\r\npurchasers can therefore be characterized as taxpayers.  However, the seller must also be\r\ncharacterized as a tax collector, and because of this, seller and purchaser liability to the state as\r\ntaxpayers arises for differing reasons:  the purchaser, as a statutory debtor to the seller but\r\nultimately liable to the state, owes sales tax on its purchase transaction; the seller also owes the\r\nstate the sales taxes a customer incurs because the seller must, under the state's authority, collect\r\nthose taxes.  Under the Act, then, the economic burden of the tax is on the purchaser:  the sales\r\ntax will either be collected by the seller from the purchaser under the state's authority and then\r\nremitted to the state; or, if the seller fails to bill the purchaser, the tax will be collected directly\r\nby the state from either the seller or purchaser.<strong><sup> (7)</sup></strong></span><span>  <em>See Malcuit v. State</em>, 134 B.R. 185, 187 (Bankr.\r\nN.D. Tex. 1991) (observing that burden of sales tax is on purchaser and that seller collects it on\r\nbehalf of the state).  By contrast, the seller, as collector of the sales tax paid by the purchaser,\r\nbears the legal incidence of the tax; the seller pays a tax in the sense that it remits the tax\r\npayments collected from the purchaser to the state.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that even though the Act's detailed provisions for collection and\r\npayment of sales taxes contain no express language describing the seller as an agent for the\r\ncollection of the state's taxes or providing that the taxes collected be held in trust for the state, the\r\nAct's provisions nevertheless set forth an implicit agency-principal relationship, rather than a\r\ndebtor-creditor relationship, between sellers in their role as tax collectors and the state.  <em>Cf.\r\nAnderson v. State</em>, 265 N.W. 210, 212 (Wis. 1936) (\"Of course any [sales tax] agent who fails\r\nto turn over collections [to the state] by his failure becomes a debtor, but becoming a debtor does\r\nnot destroy the relation of agency.\").  We are inclined toward this view because of the Act's\r\nprovisions (1) allowing sellers reimbursement for expenses of collection; (2) subjecting sellers to\r\ncivil or criminal penalties for failure to report or pay taxes imposed; (3) requiring sellers to collect\r\nsales tax from purchasers by adding the tax to the sales price; and (4) providing that the sales tax\r\nis the purchaser's debt to the seller.  <em>See Texas Co. v.

The\r\ntax was initially imposed to generate funds for the state's use, and thus the state, not the seller as\r\nthe intermediary sales tax collector, is the beneficiary of the tax.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSimilar agency relationships have been held to exist in other tax collector\r\ncircumstances.  <em>See Daywood v. Calvert</em>, 478 S.W.2d 152, 155-56 (Tex. Civ. App.--Austin 1972,\r\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.) (observing that cigarette excise tax collectors are state agents and tax \"is money\r\nbelonging to the state, held in trust for the state by the . . . person or firm collecting the money\");\r\n<em>Miller</em>, 165 F.2d at 113-14 (concluding under Texas statute imposing tax on sales of gasoline,\r\nseller is state's collecting agency, required and authorized to collect gasoline tax from purchaser\r\nand transmit it to the state).  <em>See generally</em> 68 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Sales and Use Tax</em>, § 1 (1993) (\"[T]he\r\nseller has the statutory duty to collect the tax <em>for</em> the taxing jurisdiction.\") (emphasis added).  We\r\nhold that because of the implicit agency relationship set forth in the Act, sales tax monies are state\r\nfunds from the moment of the seller's collection, and the seller, as the state's agent, has not only\r\na statutory duty but also a fiduciary duty to remit these funds to the state.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOur conclusion finds support in bankruptcy cases, which, for the purpose of\r\nestablishing debt priority, have addressed the status of sales taxes collected in Texas before 1987\r\nbut not remitted to the state and have concluded that in the seller's hands, collected sales taxes\r\nconstitute property held in trust for the state.  Under the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor is liable for\r\ncertain taxes such as income and social security taxes which are \"required to be collected or\r\nwithheld.\"  11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(7)(C) (1988); <em>see Rosenow v. Illinois Dep't of Revenue</em>, 715 F.2d\r\n277, 280 (7th Cir. 1983); <em>see also Malcuit</em>, 134 B.R. at 187 (emphasizing that § 507(a)(7)(C)\r\ntaxes are those required to be collected from third parties).  Taxes falling under § 507(a)(7)(C)\r\nare commonly referred to as \"trust fund taxes.\"  <em>Malcuit</em>, 134 B.R. at 187. <strong> </strong>Comparing the\r\nlanguage of § 507(a)(6)(C) to similar language in the Tax Code, bankruptcy courts have concluded\r\nthat sales taxes collected before the amendment of section 111.016 fall into the Bankruptcy Code's\r\ntrust fund taxes category for priority purposes.  <em>See In re Gulf Consol. Servs., Inc.</em>, 110 B.R. 267,\r\n267-68 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 1989) (holding that pre-amended version of section 111.016 required\r\nsales taxes collected from 1980 to 1983 to be of a \"trust-fund\" nature); <em>In re Avant</em>, 110 B.R. 264,\r\n265-66 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1989) (concluding sales taxes collected before 1987 pursuant to Tax\r\nCode § 151.052 were taxes a retailer collected from third parties and were trust fund taxes); <em>see\r\nalso Malcuit</em>, 134 B.R. at 187-88 (including sales taxes owed by tax collector from sales tax\r\ntransactions in 1972 and 1973 as priority claim trust fund taxes under Bankruptcy Code\r\n§ 507(a)(7)(C)); <em>see generally In re Al Copeland Enters., Inc.</em>, 133 B.R. 837, 838 (Bankr. W.D.\r\nTex. 1991) (commenting that trust fund language of amended section 111.016 clarified status of\r\ncollected sales taxes as trust funds).  Thus, bankruptcy courts considered sales taxes imposed by\r\nand collected under the Tax Code to be of a \"trust fund nature\" before the amendment of section\r\n111.016; now, however, as <em>In re Al Copeland Enterprises</em> suggests, the taxes are not merely of\r\na \"trust fund nature,\" but have been expressly characterized by statute as trust funds.  <em>See</em> <em>id</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn light of our conclusion that the Act sets forth an agency relationship rather than\r\na debtor-creditor relationship, we hold that even before the amendment of section 111.016 to\r\ninclude \"trust fund\" language, the sales taxes collected by agent-sellers on behalf of the state,\r\nwhile not expressly characterized as trust funds, were of a trust fund nature and thus were the\r\nstate's property.  Accordingly, since sales taxes collected before the amendment of section\r\n111.016 were not the seller's property but were only collected by the seller on behalf of the state,\r\nour holding in <em>Dixon</em> is applicable to the instant cause to subject Davis to liability for his conduct\r\nin actively participating in the tort of conversion through his spending of sales tax money collected\r\nby JDA for purposes other than the payment of the taxes to appellees.  <em>See </em>808 S.W.2d at 724. \r\nThe trial court therefore did not retroactively apply amended section 111.016 to Davis.  The\r\nagency relationship arising from the Act's provisions operates under both versions of section\r\n111.016.  We overrule Davis's second point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t  In his third and fourth points of error, Davis complains that the trial court's\r\njudgment awards to appellees were erroneous because no evidence was presented to support the\r\njudgment amounts.  In their second cross-point of error, appellees argue that the trial court's\r\njudgment amounts were erroneous because stipulated evidence established that appellees were\r\ndamaged in amounts greater than those awarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe stipulated \"payment agreement\" in evidence indicates JDA originally owed\r\nappellees $190,737.12 in sales taxes.  Of this amount, state sales taxes totaled $134,350.43, city\r\nsales taxes totaled $28,914.43, and transit authority sales taxes totaled $27,472.26.  The stipulated\r\n\"payment agreement\" additionally indicates that by February 12, 1986, JDA owed appellees a\r\ntotal of $217,641.00 in sales taxes, including interest, for the collection period through December\r\n31, 1984.  Of this amount, state sales taxes plus interest totaled $154,457.98, city sales taxes plus\r\ninterest totaled $32,078.80, and transit authority sales taxes plus interest totaled $31,104.22. \r\nNone of the stipulated amounts equal the total judgment award of $401,821.75.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees assert that the judgment award properly includes interest accruing from\r\n1986 up to the day of judgment as well as penalties for JDA's failure to pay.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code\r\nAnn. § 111.016 (holding tax collector liable for full amount of tax collected as well as accrued\r\npenalties and interest on amount collected).  Even if appellees are correct, no stipulated evidence\r\nat trial specifies interest owed by JDA after February 12, 1986, or any penalties owed.  In fact,\r\nthe stipulated \"payment agreement\" indicates that while interest would continue to accrue at\r\nstatutory rates, all penalties had been waived.  As such, the judgment award exceeds the stipulated\r\ntaxes due.  Accordingly, we overrule appellees' second cross-point of error and sustain Davis's\r\nthird and fourth points of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDavis's first point of error argues that the trial court erroneously relied on and cited\r\nan unpublished opinion as authority for its judgment.  However, the final judgment included in\r\nthe record does not cite to any authority.  Regardless of the authority upon which the trial court\r\nrelied, we have concluded the trial court's judgment of Davis's liability is proper under <em>Dixon</em>. \r\n<em>See </em>808 S.W.2d at 724.  We overrule Davis's first point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the amount of damages awarded in the judgment is incorrect, we reverse\r\nthe trial court's judgment.

In short, by December 31, 1984, Jim Davis Auctioneers,\r\nInc. (\"JDA\") had collected $190,737.12 in sales taxes; of this amount, state sales taxes totaled\r\n$134,350.43, city sales taxes totaled $28,914.43, and transit authority sales taxes totaled\r\n$27,472.26.  Davis was president and director of JDA throughout the time period at issue; he\r\ncontrolled both the management and financial affairs of JDA.  Davis, or those answerable to him,\r\ncommingled the tax receipts into JDA's operating account and paid out the funds to entities other\r\nthan appellees.  To date, no sales taxes JDA collected have been remitted to appellees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Comptroller certified the delinquent amounts to the Attorney General for\r\ncollection.  Based on the certification, appellees filed suit on July 12, 1989.<strong><sup> (1)</sup></strong>  The issues to be\r\ndetermined at trial were Davis's alleged conversion of the sales tax receipts and his liability under\r\nsection 111.016 of the Tax Code.  The trial court rendered judgment in favor of appellees on\r\nDecember 8, 1993.  Davis appeals the trial court's judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>I.\tJurisdiction</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAt the outset, we address appellees' jurisdictional cross point of error by which\r\nthey contend this Court erred in denying their motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction because\r\nDavis did not timely perfect his appeal.  To perfect his appeal, Davis did not file security for costs\r\nwithin thirty days of the signing of the trial court's judgment.  Instead, he timely requested\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law from the trial court and thereafter filed a cost bond within\r\nninety days after the judgment was signed.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 41(a)(1) (extending deadline for\r\nperfecting appeal from thirty to ninety days after judgment is signed when findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law are timely requested following non-jury trial).  Appellees argue that Davis's\r\nrequest for findings of fact and conclusions of law failed to extend the deadline to perfect an\r\nappeal because findings of fact and conclusions of law are (1) unwarranted unless a trial has taken\r\nplace and (2) inappropriate in an agreed case.  We will address each argument in turn.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>\tA.\tTrial</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>    \tAppellees remind us that parties may request findings of fact and conclusions of\r\nlaw only in cases tried without a jury.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 296.  Appellees place much emphasis\r\non the word \"tried\":  they argue that a proceeding based on stipulated evidence, like that in the\r\ninstant case, cannot be characterized as a \"trial\" within the meaning of Rule 296, and assert that\r\nany request for findings of fact and conclusions of law stemming from such a proceeding therefore\r\ndoes not extend deadlines for perfecting an appeal.  We disagree.  The \"trial\" envisioned by Rule\r\n296 is an evidentiary hearing to the court <em>or</em> a bench trial on the merits.  <em>Zimmerman v. Robinson</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1685765\"><a href=\"/opinion/1685765/zimmerman-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 164 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1993, no writ).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>    \tIn the instant cause, the factual evidence was orally stipulated in proceedings before\r\nthe trial court.  One exhibit was introduced and offered into evidence.  The trial court\r\nsubsequently rendered judgment.  We conclude that the instant case was \"tried . . . without a\r\njury\" as required by Rule 296; a bench trial on the merits took place regardless of whether the\r\ncourt received only stipulated evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>\tB.\tAgreed Case</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the proceedings constituted a nonjury trial, we generally would conclude\r\nthat the timely filing of a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law extended the deadline\r\nto perfect an appeal to ninety days after the judgment was signed.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 41(a)(1). \r\nHowever, appellees argue that we should treat the instant cause as an \"Agreed Case\" under Texas\r\nRule of Civil Procedure 263<strong><sup> (2)</sup></strong> and hold that a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law\r\nis inappropriate and cannot extend the appellate timeline.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo qualify as an agreed case, an agreed statement of facts upon which judgment\r\nshall be rendered must be filed with the court clerk.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 263.<strong><sup> (3)</sup></strong>  The parties in this\r\ncause did not strictly comply with Rule 263.

State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2438506\"><a href=\"/opinion/2438506/dixon-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span>, 723 (Tex. App.--Austin 1991, writ dism'd w.o.j.).  Before the\r\n1987 amendment, however, Davis contends that section 111.016 did not mandate a trust\r\nrelationship but rather provided for a debtor-creditor relationship between the state and sales tax\r\ncollectors.  Davis cites no authority in support of this position.  Yet, he argues sales taxes\r\ncollected before 1987 did not become state property until remitted to the state.  Davis maintains\r\nthat he cannot be liable on theories of conversion or breach of fiduciary duty when appellees had\r\nno ownership interest in the taxes JDA collected in 1984.  To hold him liable for either tort, Davis\r\nargues the trial court retroactively applied amended section 111.016 to him in contravention of\r\nArticle I, section 16 of the Texas Constitution and section 311.022 of the Code Construction Act.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn response, appellees contend that even in 1984 when JDA collected the sales taxes\r\nat issue, the pre-amendment form of section 111.016 set forth a trust relationship between the state\r\nand sales tax collectors with respect to sales tax funds collected.<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong>  As such, they contend JDA's\r\nfailure to remit the receipts constituted the tort of conversion for which Davis can be held jointly\r\nliable with JDA.  <em>See id</em>. at 723-24.  Appellees argue that the amendment's scant legislative\r\nhistory suggests its purpose was to clarify existing law.  In addition, appellees suggest that the\r\nstructure of the Texas sales tax system establishes an agency relationship imposing duties on the\r\nagent tax collector with respect to the principal's--the state's--property.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNo Texas case law addresses the relationship section 111.016 imposed on sales tax\r\ncollectors and the state as to sales taxes collected before 1987.  Moreover, the parties indicate that\r\nno legislative history is available to shed light on the meaning of the 1987 amendment to section\r\n111.016.  However, observing that section 111.016, located under the Tax Code chapter entitled\r\n\"Collection Procedures,\" applies generally to all taxes imposed by the Tax Code, we logically\r\nlook to the specific portions of the Tax Code imposing the sales tax and detailing the sales tax\r\nscheme and manner of payment for guidance as to the relationship existing between the state and\r\nsales tax collectors both before and after the 1987 amendment to section 111.016.  <em>See </em>Limited\r\nSales, Excise, and Use Tax Act, Tex.

The seller must collect the sales tax by adding\r\nthe tax to the sales price of the taxable item; the tax is the purchaser's debt to the seller until paid. \r\nTex.

Generally, sales taxes are due to the\r\ncomptroller quarterly or on or before the twentieth day of the month.  <em>Id</em>. § 151.401(b) (West\r\nSupp. 1995).  Sales taxes paid to the state by the seller are computed based on the application of\r\nthe sales tax rate to the total receipts of taxable sales and services collected from the purchaser. \r\n<em>Id</em>. § 151.410 (West 1992).

However, the seller must also be\r\ncharacterized as a tax collector, and because of this, seller and purchaser liability to the state as\r\ntaxpayers arises for differing reasons:  the purchaser, as a statutory debtor to the seller but\r\nultimately liable to the state, owes sales tax on its purchase transaction; the seller also owes the\r\nstate the sales taxes a customer incurs because the seller must, under the state's authority, collect\r\nthose taxes.  Under the Act, then, the economic burden of the tax is on the purchaser:  the sales\r\ntax will either be collected by the seller from the purchaser under the state's authority and then\r\nremitted to the state; or, if the seller fails to bill the purchaser, the tax will be collected directly\r\nby the state from either the seller or purchaser.<strong><sup> (7)</sup></strong></span><span>  <em>See Malcuit v.

Tex. 1991) (observing that burden of sales tax is on purchaser and that seller collects it on\r\nbehalf of the state).  By contrast, the seller, as collector of the sales tax paid by the purchaser,\r\nbears the legal incidence of the tax; the seller pays a tax in the sense that it remits the tax\r\npayments collected from the purchaser to the state.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that even though the Act's detailed provisions for collection and\r\npayment of sales taxes contain no express language describing the seller as an agent for the\r\ncollection of the state's taxes or providing that the taxes collected be held in trust for the state, the\r\nAct's provisions nevertheless set forth an implicit agency-principal relationship, rather than a\r\ndebtor-creditor relationship, between sellers in their role as tax collectors and the state.  <em>Cf.\r\nAnderson v.

We are inclined toward this view because of the Act's\r\nprovisions (1) allowing sellers reimbursement for expenses of collection; (2) subjecting sellers to\r\ncivil or criminal penalties for failure to report or pay taxes imposed; (3) requiring sellers to collect\r\nsales tax from purchasers by adding the tax to the sales price; and (4) providing that the sales tax\r\nis the purchaser's debt to the seller.  <em>See Texas Co. v.

We\r\nhold that because of the implicit agency relationship set forth in the Act, sales tax monies are state\r\nfunds from the moment of the seller's collection, and the seller, as the state's agent, has not only\r\na statutory duty but also a fiduciary duty to remit these funds to the state.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOur conclusion finds support in bankruptcy cases, which, for the purpose of\r\nestablishing debt priority, have addressed the status of sales taxes collected in Texas before 1987\r\nbut not remitted to the state and have concluded that in the seller's hands, collected sales taxes\r\nconstitute property held in trust for the state.

W.D.\r\nTex. 1991) (commenting that trust fund language of amended section 111.016 clarified status of\r\ncollected sales taxes as trust funds).  Thus, bankruptcy courts considered sales taxes imposed by\r\nand collected under the Tax Code to be of a \"trust fund nature\" before the amendment of section\r\n111.016; now, however, as <em>In re Al Copeland Enterprises</em> suggests, the taxes are not merely of\r\na \"trust fund nature,\" but have been expressly characterized by statute as trust funds.  <em>See</em> <em>id</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn light of our conclusion that the Act sets forth an agency relationship rather than\r\na debtor-creditor relationship, we hold that even before the amendment of section 111.016 to\r\ninclude \"trust fund\" language, the sales taxes collected by agent-sellers on behalf of the state,\r\nwhile not expressly characterized as trust funds, were of a trust fund nature and thus were the\r\nstate's property.  Accordingly, since sales taxes collected before the amendment of section\r\n111.016 were not the seller's property but were only collected by the seller on behalf of the state,\r\nour holding in <em>Dixon</em> is applicable to the instant cause to subject Davis to liability for his conduct\r\nin actively participating in the tort of conversion through his spending of sales tax money collected\r\nby JDA for purposes other than the payment of the taxes to appellees.  <em>See </em>808 S.W.2d at 724. \r\nThe trial court therefore did not retroactively apply amended section 111.016 to Davis.  The\r\nagency relationship arising from the Act's provisions operates under both versions of section\r\n111.016.  We overrule Davis's second point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t  In his third and fourth points of error, Davis complains that the trial court's\r\njudgment awards to appellees were erroneous because no evidence was presented to support the\r\njudgment amounts.  In their second cross-point of error, appellees argue that the trial court's\r\njudgment amounts were erroneous because stipulated evidence established that appellees were\r\ndamaged in amounts greater than those awarded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe stipulated \"payment agreement\" in evidence indicates JDA originally owed\r\nappellees $190,737.12 in sales taxes.  Of this amount, state sales taxes totaled $134,350.43, city\r\nsales taxes totaled $28,914.43, and transit authority sales taxes totaled $27,472.26.  The stipulated\r\n\"payment agreement\" additionally indicates that by February 12, 1986, JDA owed appellees a\r\ntotal of $217,641.00 in sales taxes, including interest, for the collection period through December\r\n31, 1984.  Of this amount, state sales taxes plus interest totaled $154,457.98, city sales taxes plus\r\ninterest totaled $32,078.80, and transit authority sales taxes plus interest totaled $31,104.22. \r\nNone of the stipulated amounts equal the total judgment award of $401,821.75.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellees assert that the judgment award properly includes interest accruing from\r\n1986 up to the day of judgment as well as penalties for JDA's failure to pay.  <em>See</em> Tex. Tax Code\r\nAnn. § 111.016 (holding tax collector liable for full amount of tax collected as well as accrued\r\npenalties and interest on amount collected).  Even if appellees are correct, no stipulated evidence\r\nat trial specifies interest owed by JDA after February 12, 1986, or any penalties owed.  In fact,\r\nthe stipulated \"payment agreement\" indicates that while interest would continue to accrue at\r\nstatutory rates, all penalties had been waived.  As such, the judgment award exceeds the stipulated\r\ntaxes due.  Accordingly, we overrule appellees' second cross-point of error and sustain Davis's\r\nthird and fourth points of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDavis's first point of error argues that the trial court erroneously relied on and cited\r\nan unpublished opinion as authority for its judgment.  However, the final judgment included in\r\nthe record does not cite to any authority.

Tax Code Ann. § 111.016 (West 1992) (emphasis added). \r\n<p>5.      <strong>  Appellees also argue that Davis is personally liable for the tax funds because the Tax\r\nCode imposes individual liability on \"[a]ny person who receives or collects a tax.\"  Tex.\r\nTax Code Ann. § 111.016 (West 1992).  Since we dispose of this case on other grounds,\r\nwe do not reach appellees' alternate argument. \r\n<p>6.      <strong>  An excise tax is \"[a] tax on the manufacture, sale, or use of goods.\"  Black's Law\r\nDictionary 563 (6th ed. 1990).\r\n<p>7.      <strong>  If the state collects the tax from the seller, the seller has a cause of action against\r\nthe purchaser to recover the tax it should have originally collected from the purchaser. \r\n</strong><em>See </em>Tex.
