In his civil rights action, Wilkins alleges that\n\nofficials at the Allenwood Federal Correctional Institution (FCI-Allenwood) retaliated\n\nagainst him for taking administrative action in response to a dispute with officials at the\n\nfacility’s UNICOR factory concerning Wilkins’ pay grade, position, and work\n\nenvironment.1 In particular, Wilkins alleges that his First Amendment rights were\n\nviolated by the defendants’ retaliatory acts, and that he was denied due process when he\n\nlost his prison job, when he was moved into the prison’s special housing unit, and during\n\nhis disciplinary hearings. Wilkins also alleges that the defendants violated his Equal\n\nProtection rights and his Eighth Amendment rights, and that they conspired against him.\n\n       In response to the complaint, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the\n\n\n   1\n    Because we write for the parties, we do not set forth all of the facts of the case in\ndetail.\n\n                                              2\n\fcomplaint or, alternatively, for summary judgment. Wilkins filed a response in\n\nopposition. The District Court entered summary judgment in the defendants’ favor; this\n\ntimely appeal followed.2 Because the appeal lacks arguable merit, we will dismiss it\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We agree substantially with the District Court’s analysis. We write here to\n\naddress Wilkins’ Due Process challenge to his disciplinary hearings and placement in\n\nspecial housing. A prisoner cannot bring a constitutional tort suit which would challenge\n\nthe validity of his conviction or sentence unless that conviction or sentence has first been\n\ninvalidated. See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486-87 (1994). However, only\n\nclaims which “necessarily implicate the fact or duration of” confinement are barred;\n\nclaims that “relate to the conditions of incarceration” are not subject to Heck’s favorable\n\ntermination requirement. Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d 141, 145 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n       Wilkins’ complaint takes issue with three disciplinary hearings. At the first, the\n\nDisciplinary Hearing Officer (DHO) concluded that Wilkins had committed the offense\n\nof Unauthorized Use of Mail and sanctioned him by revoking his commissary and\n\ntelephone privileges for a year. Although not a part of the DHO’s sanction, Wilkins also\n\nwas placed in special housing (administrative detention) from January 27, 2003, when the\n\n\n\n   2\n    We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We exercise plenary review over the\nDistrict Court’s decision to grant summary judgment. See Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d\n141, 145 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n                                              3\n\fmail offense occurred, though December 16, 2003, the date of his eventual transfer to\n\nFCI-Otisville. This was done in order to prevent contact between Wilkins and the\n\nprisoner who informed the authorities that Wilkins had used that prisoner’s mailing\n\nprivileges. The second disciplinary hearing occurred as a result of Wilkins’ possession of\n\ntobacco and matches, which are not authorized in special housing. Wilkins received a\n\nsanction of disciplinary segregation for 15 days, a 90-day revocation of visitation\n\nprivileges, and a loss of 13 days of good conduct time. The third disciplinary hearing\n\nresulted from Wilkins’ attempt to flush a lit cigarette down the toilet drain, for which he\n\nreceived a sanction of disciplinary segregation for 21 days, a 180-day revocation of\n\nvisitation privileges, and a loss of 20 days of good conduct time. Because the loss of\n\ngood conduct time affects the duration of Wilkins’ confinement, Heck bars Wilkins’\n\nchallenge to the second and third disciplinary hearings. See Edwards v. Balisok, 520\n\nU.S. 641, 646-48 (1997). The fact that Wilkins has not specifically requested relief\n\nwhich would alter the term of his confinement is of no consequence. See Torres, 292\n\nF.3d at 147 (noting that the prisoner in Edwards did not seek restoration of the good time\n\ncredits he lost).\n\n       With regard to the first disciplinary hearing, Wilkins’ due process claim is\n\ncognizable but does not have merit. Due process protection is not triggered unless there\n\nis a deprivation of a legally cognizable liberty interest. See Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d\n\n523, 531 (3d Cir. 2003). Although the Supreme Court has found that the loss of good\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\ftime credits entitles prisoners to appropriate due process, see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418\n\nU.S. 539, 556-57 (1974), the question of whether a sanction implicates a liberty interest\n\nis not answered by looking at good time credits alone. A liberty interest may also be\n\npresent where a punishment entails an “atypical and significant hardship.” Mitchell, 318\n\nF.3d at 532 (citation omitted). Courts are required to look into this possibility. See id. at\n\n533 n.6. In order to do so, a court should perform a fact-specific inquiry evaluating “the\n\nduration of disciplinary confinement and the conditions of that confinement in relation to\n\nother prison conditions.” Id. at 532 (citation omitted).\n\n       Applying these criteria, we conclude that Wilkins has not shown that he had a\n\nliberty interest at stake. His loss of commissary and telephone privileges certainly do not\n\nqualify. Nor has he provided any evidence that the conditions during his stay in\n\nadministrative segregation involved atypical or significant hardship. In addition, this\n\nCourt has found that administrative detention for a longer period than that imposed upon\n\nWilkins and housing in a more restrictive type of detention than that imposed upon\n\nWilkins did not implicate the prisoner’s liberty interests. See Smith v. Mensinger, 293\n\nF.3d 641, 645, 654 (3d Cir. 2002) (seven months disciplinary confinement); Torres v.\n\nFauver, 292 F.3d 141, 151-52 (3d Cir. 2002) (disciplinary detention for fifteen days and\n\nadministrative segregation for 120 days); Griffin v. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703, 706-09 (3d\n\nCir. 1997) (fifteen months administrative detention).\n\n       We note that Wilkins’ failure to show a liberty interest sufficient to trigger due\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fprocess protections does not mean that he cannot sustain a retaliation claim concerning\n\nthe same hearings and sanctions. See Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 224-25 (3d Cir.\n\n2000) (retaliation may be actionable even when the retaliatory action does not implicate a\n\nliberty interest). However, for the reasons explained by the District Court, Wilkins fails\n\nto establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding this or any other claim.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the District Court properly granted the motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Because this appeal lacks merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C.§ 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f",

Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777862\"><a href=\"/opinion/777862/antonio-torres-v-william-fauver-new-jersey-commissioner-of-corrections-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n                                              3\n\fmail offense occurred, though December 16, 2003, the date of his eventual transfer to\n\nFCI-Otisville. This was done in order to prevent contact between Wilkins and the\n\nprisoner who informed the authorities that Wilkins had used that prisoner’s mailing\n\nprivileges. The second disciplinary hearing occurred as a result of Wilkins’ possession of\n\ntobacco and matches, which are not authorized in special housing. Wilkins received a\n\nsanction of disciplinary segregation for 15 days, a 90-day revocation of visitation\n\nprivileges, and a loss of 13 days of good conduct time. The third disciplinary hearing\n\nresulted from Wilkins’ attempt to flush a lit cigarette down the toilet drain, for which he\n\nreceived a sanction of disciplinary segregation for 21 days, a 180-day revocation of\n\nvisitation privileges, and a loss of 20 days of good conduct time. Because the loss of\n\ngood conduct time affects the duration of Wilkins’ confinement, Heck bars Wilkins’\n\nchallenge to the second and third disciplinary hearings. See Edwards v. Balisok, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118112\"><a href=\"/opinion/118112/edwards-v-balisok/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646-48 (1997). The fact that Wilkins has not specifically requested relief\n\nwhich would alter the term of his confinement is of no consequence. See Torres, 292\n\nF.3d at 147 (noting that the prisoner in Edwards did not seek restoration of the good time\n\ncredits he lost).\n\n       With regard to the first disciplinary hearing, Wilkins’ due process claim is\n\ncognizable but does not have merit. Due process protection is not triggered unless there\n\nis a deprivation of a legally cognizable liberty interest. See Mitchell v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780725\"><a href=\"/opinion/780725/mark-mitchell-v-martin-f-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531 (3d Cir. 2003). Although the Supreme Court has found that the loss of good\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\ftime credits entitles prisoners to appropriate due process, see Wolff v. McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 556-57 (1974), the question of whether a sanction implicates a liberty interest\n\nis not answered by looking at good time credits alone. A liberty interest may also be\n\npresent where a punishment entails an “atypical and significant hardship.” Mitchell, 318\n\nF.3d at 532 (citation omitted). Courts are required to look into this possibility. See id. at\n\n533 n.6. In order to do so, a court should perform a fact-specific inquiry evaluating “the\n\nduration of disciplinary confinement and the conditions of that confinement in relation to\n\nother prison conditions.” Id. at 532 (citation omitted).\n\n       Applying these criteria, we conclude that Wilkins has not shown that he had a\n\nliberty interest at stake. His loss of commissary and telephone privileges certainly do not\n\nqualify. Nor has he provided any evidence that the conditions during his stay in\n\nadministrative segregation involved atypical or significant hardship. In addition, this\n\nCourt has found that administrative detention for a longer period than that imposed upon\n\nWilkins and housing in a more restrictive type of detention than that imposed upon\n\nWilkins did not implicate the prisoner’s liberty interests.

Mensinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778006\"><a href=\"/opinion/778006/carl-m-smith-v-robin-mensinger-david-novitsky-jerome-paulukonis-mary/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645, 654 (3d Cir. 2002) (seven months disciplinary confinement); Torres v.\n\nFauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777862\"><a href=\"/opinion/777862/antonio-torres-v-william-fauver-new-jersey-commissioner-of-corrections-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 151-52 (3d Cir. 2002) (disciplinary detention for fifteen days and\n\nadministrative segregation for 120 days); Griffin v.

See Allah v. Seiverling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770720\"><a href=\"/opinion/770720/michael-malik-allah-v-thomas-seiverling-robert-sparbanie-john-deletto-ben/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224-25 (3d Cir.\n\n2000) (retaliation may be actionable even when the retaliatory action does not implicate a\n\nliberty interest). However, for the reasons explained by the District Court, Wilkins fails\n\nto establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding this or any other claim.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the District Court properly granted the motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Because this appeal lacks merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C.§ 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f</pre>",
