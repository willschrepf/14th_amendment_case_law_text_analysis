M EYERS and C OCHRAN, JJ.,\n       concurred in the result of the Court’s disposition of point of error two and\n       otherwise joined in the Court’s opinion. W OMACK, J., filed a dissenting\n       opinion, in which J OHNSON, J., joined. H ERVEY, J., did not participate.\n\n\n       A Bexar County jury found appellant guilty of the capital murder of Luther “Luke” Scott.1\n\n\n       1\n          The grand jury, in its indictment, charged appellant with one count of capital murder in\ntwo paragraphs. Paragraph A charged appellant with the capital murder of Scott under Texas\nPenal Code § 19.03(a)(2) (murder in the course of burglary), and Paragraph B charged him with\nthe capital murder of Scott under Texas Penal Code § 19.03(a)(7)(B) (murder of more than one\n                                                                                      (continued...)\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 2\n\nBased on the jury’s answers to the special issues set forth in Article 37.071, §§ 2(b) and 2(e), of the\n\nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court sentenced appellant to death. We will affirm.\n\n                                     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       Appellant worked as a barback (i.e., a bartender’s assistant) at the “Poly Esther’s” nightclub\n\nin San Antonio for approximately four months. Luke Scott was the general manager of the\n\nnightclub. In the time appellant worked at the nightclub, he was “written up” over ten times for\n\nemployee-rule violations. Assistant Manager Trent Merrill, who directly supervised appellant,\n\ndescribed him as “lackadaisical” and said that he had “problems following rules.” Appellant seemed\n\nto blame Scott for his problems at work and told other employees that “he was going to follow\n\n[Scott] home and shoot him” and that “if you found [Scott] on the news dead, you know who did it.”\n\nOther employees overheard appellant say things such as “that bitch is going to get what he deserves”\n\nand that he was going to “follow [Scott] home and fuck him up.” Appellant believed Scott was\n\nmean and later told police that Scott treated him “like a bitch.” Eventually, on February 14, 2004,\n\nappellant was fired.\n\n       Two weeks later, appellant followed Scott home from work and parked outside the\n\napartment-complex gates so he would not be seen. Appellant was not able to see which apartment\n\nScott entered, but he saw a light on in an apartment near where Scott had parked his car. Appellant\n\nclimbed up onto the balcony of that apartment and entered through the balcony door. Once inside,\n\n\n\n       1\n        (...continued)\nperson pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct). The jury found appellant guilty under\nboth paragraphs.\n       Paragraph B alleged that appellant’s other victim was Sandra Ramos. Appellant’s murder\nof Ramos was the aggravating element that elevated his murder of Scott to a capital offense. See\nNarvaiz v. State, 840 S.W.2d 415, 432-433 (Tex.Crim.App. 1992).\n\f                                                                                             Espada - 3\n\nappellant encountered Sandra Ramos. Ramos did not know Luke Scott – appellant had entered the\n\nwrong apartment.\n\n       For nearly half an hour, Ramos spoke with appellant, attempting to defuse the situation and\n\nsave her life. Appellant “didn’t know what to do but [he] still wanted Luke. [He] didn’t want to get\n\ncaught.” Appellant hit Ramos on the back of her head with the butt of his handgun, and then bound\n\nher hands and legs with tape. Ramos regained consciousness before appellant placed a plastic trash\n\nbag over her head and tightened it. Appellant then took Ramos’s truck key and left her apartment\n\nwhile she was still alive.\n\n       A few days later, appellant returned to the apartment complex for Scott. This time, appellant\n\nclimbed onto the balcony of Scott’s apartment, cut the screen, and went through the open sliding\n\nglass door. Appellant waited in the dark for about an hour before Scott returned home. When Scott\n\nentered the apartment and walked down a hallway, appellant met him with a drawn .45 revolver.\n\nAppellant shot at Scott, and Scott tried to run away but fell. Appellant shot at Scott two more times,\n\nthe final time into the back of Scott’s head. When appellant left Scott’s apartment, he took Scott’s\n\ncar keys, watch, hand-held computer, and wallet, and then drove away in Scott’s car.\n\n                      ADMISSIBILITY OF APPELLANT’S CONFESSION\n\n       In point of error six, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in admitting his confession to\n\nthe murder of Sandra Ramos. Appellant contends that police disregarded his attempt to terminate\n\nhis interview in violation of Article 38.22 and Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n       On July 14, 2005, the trial court held a hearing on appellant’s motion to suppress the\n\nconfession. At that hearing, the State called San Antonio Police Department Detectives Elizabeth\n\nGreiner and Robert Handowski to testify regarding the statements they took from appellant.\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 4\n\n       Greiner testified that on March 25, 2004, she executed an arrest warrant for appellant for the\n\nmurder of Luke Scott. Appellant was twice read “his rights” before making a statement in which he\n\nconfessed to Scott’s murder. Greiner testified that, at the time of appellant’s arrest, she only “felt”\n\nthat appellant was involved in Sandra Ramos’s murder. According to Greiner, that feeling developed\n\ninto actual suspicion because (1) appellant’s demeanor changed when he was asked to provide a\n\nDNA swab and (2) he was hesitant to speak with her regarding Ramos’s murder.\n\n       Greiner, not wanting to destroy any rapport she had built with appellant, concluded her\n\ninterview with him. Handowski, who had been investigating Ramos’s murder, next spoke with\n\nappellant. Handowski testified that, before beginning the interview, he again read appellant his\n\nrights. Although police did not have any evidence connecting appellant to Ramos’s death,\n\nHandowski told appellant that there was a lot of evidence in Ramos’s apartment and that he knew\n\nappellant had killed Ramos. Initially, appellant denied involvement, but when Handowski talked\n\nabout the death penalty and religion, appellant responded that he did not want to go to prison, that\n\nthere was “no pride” in being a woman killer, and that he would “embarrass members of his family\n\nand his church.” Handowski testified that he told appellant that it would be best to tell the truth and\n\nthat Ramos’ family also needed closure.\n\n       Handowski testified that there was a lull in the conversation at this point for a few minutes,\n\nduring which it appeared to him that appellant was thinking about, or considering, the situation.\n\nHandowski told appellant, “Well, let’s start with something easy, tell me what you did with her\n\nvehicle.” Appellant then told Handowski where police could find Ramos’s truck. Handowski\n\nexcused himself to ask other officers to go find the truck. When Handowski returned to the\n\ninterview room, appellant told him how Ramos’ murder occurred.\n\f                                                                                          Espada - 5\n\n       Appellant argues that the “lull in the conversation” described by Handowski was an assertion\n\nof his right to remain silent. Handowski testified, however, that while appellant did not offer\n\nanything as Handowski continued talking for a few minutes, he attributed appellant’s lack of\n\nimmediate response to guilt. Handowski also testified that at no time did appellant request\n\ntermination of the interview or ask for a lawyer. The State argued that appellant’s lack of response\n\nfor a few minutes was not an invocation of his right to silence nor an expression of his desire to\n\nterminate the interview.\n\n       The trial court agreed with the State and entered the following findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law:\n\n               1. The defendant’s statement to Detective Handowski was made while the\n       defendant was in lawful custody and prior to giving his statement, the defendant was\n       duly warned pursuant to Article 38.22 of his rights.\n               2. Given the totality of the circumstances, the Court concludes that the\n       defendant did not invoke his right to remain silent. Although the defendant was not\n       required to specifically state he was invoking his right, it is not reasonable to infer\n       that the two-minute lull in the conversation, where the defendant had already made\n       statements implicating himself and appeared to be thinking before speaking further,\n       was an invocation of his right to remain silent.\n               3. Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the defendant’s statement\n       was voluntarily made and is admissible as a matter of law and fact.\n\n       At a suppression hearing, the trial court is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and\n\nthe weight of their testimony. Wyatt v. State, 23 S.W.3d 18, 23 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). We will\n\nnot disturb the trial court’s findings if those findings are supported by the record. Id. We will only\n\nconsider whether the trial court properly applied the law to the facts. Id.\n\n       Before questioning a suspect in custody, law enforcement officials must inform him that he\n\nhas the right to remain silent and that any statement he makes may be used against him in court.\n\nDickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 438-39 (2000); Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444. An accused\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 6\n\nmust also be advised that he has the right to terminate questioning. Art. 38.22, § (2)(a)(5). The\n\nstatement of an accused may be used in evidence against him if it appears that it was freely and\n\nvoluntarily made, without compulsion or persuasion. See Art. 38.21. If at any time before or during\n\nquestioning, a suspect being questioned indicates in any manner that he wishes to remain silent, the\n\ninterrogation must cease. Miranda, 384 U.S. at 473-74. A suspect does not need to use any\n\nparticular word or phrase to invoke his right to remain silent. Watson v. State, 762 S.W.2d 591, 597\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1988). Further, silence in the face of repeated questioning can serve as an\n\nindication of the desire to invoke the right to remain silent. Ramos v. State, 245 S.W.3d 410, 418\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 2008). However, if a suspect’s invocation of his right is ambiguous, an officer is\n\nnot required to cease questioning. Dowthitt v. State, 931 S.W.2d 244, 257 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n\n       In this case, the trial court heard testimony during the suppression hearing from Handowski\n\nthat appellant did not affirmatively invoke his right to silence or attempt to terminate the interview.\n\nThere was an approximately two-minute lull in the conversation, during which appellant appeared\n\nto be thinking. Handowski then posed a question regarding where the police could find Ramos’s\n\ntruck. Handowski left the room to direct other officers to recover Ramos’s truck from where\n\nappellant said he left it. When Handowski returned, appellant provided a statement detailing\n\nRamos’s murder. The record supports the trial court’s decision. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting appellant’s statement confessing to Ramos’s murder. Point of error six is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                    RIGHT TO PUBLIC TRIAL\n\n       In his fifth point of error, appellant complains that portions of his voir dire proceedings were\n\nclosed to the public, thus depriving him of a public trial. Appellant describes two instances in which\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 7\n\nhe claims he was denied his right to a public trial. The first instance occurred on August 1, 2005.\n\nWith appellant present, the trial court held a hearing regarding juror Bowman, who had been selected\n\nbut not yet sworn. During that hearing, Bowman was excused because of a family bereavement.\n\nAppellant complains that this hearing, which appears to have been held in chambers, deprived him\n\nof the right to a public trial. Appellant bases his complaint on a single statement made by the trial\n\ncourt that “I’ve got all the lawyers and the defendant in my office.” There is no indication on the\n\nrecord that this was a closed hearing. There is no mention by the trial court, the State, or the defense\n\nthat members of the public or the media were prevented from attending the hearing.\n\n        In the second instance, on August 2, 2005, before proceeding to select a juror to replace\n\nBowman, the trial court stated:\n\n                Just so the record reflects this, I had a conversation with Mr. Lou Aboud. He\n        wanted to come and watch jury selection process this morning. We’ve been taken\n        out of the conference room and put in the jury room. We’re short a bailiff today. So\n        I informed him that it would not be possible for anybody to be in the jury room today\n        due to security issues. I suppose if the media wanted to come in, we could make an\n        exception, but we’re excluding family members this morning until we can get back\n        in the conference room.\n\nAppellant complains that, by closing the proceedings to family members, the trial court denied him\n\nthe right to a public trial.\n\n        The Sixth Amendment guarantees to the accused in all criminal prosecutions the right to a\n\n“public trial.” This fundamental right was extended to defendants in state criminal prosecutions\n\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment. See In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 25 (1948); see also Herring v. New\n\nYork, 422 U.S. 853, 856 (1975). The record reflects, however, that appellant failed to object at trial\n\nthat he was being denied the right to a public trial. Therefore, he forfeited the right to raise this\n\ncomplaint on appeal. Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610, 619 (1960); Brandley v. State, 691\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 8\n\nS.W.2d 699, 707 (Tex.Crim.App. 1985); Tex. R. App. Proc. 33.1. We overrule point of error\n\nnumber five.\n\n                                  ADMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPHS\n\n       In point of error twenty-seven, appellant claims that the trial court erroneously admitted\n\nevidence in violation of Rule 403 of the Texas Rules of Evidence. He specifically complains about\n\ncrime scene photographs (State’s Exhibits 92-93, 95-97, 113, and 159-164) and autopsy photographs\n\n(State’s Exhibits 3, 172-176, and 179-189B) that were admitted over defense objection. Appellant\n\nclaims that this evidence was “gratuitously” and unfairly prejudicial. Appellant argues that the\n\nphotographs were duplicative and show facts or circumstances that were otherwise established, thus\n\nlimiting their probative value.\n\n       Rule 403 provides: “Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\n\nthe jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” See\n\nGigliobianco v. State, 210 S.W.3d 637 (Tex.Crim.App. 2006). A court may consider many factors\n\nin determining whether the probative value of photographs is substantially outweighed by the danger\n\nof unfair prejudice, etc. The factors include: the number of exhibits offered, their gruesomeness,\n\ntheir detail, their size, whether they are in color or black-and-white, whether they are close up,\n\nwhether the body depicted is clothed or naked, the availability of other means of proof, and other\n\ncircumstances unique to the individual case. Santellan v. State, 939 S.W.2d 155, 172 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1997); Long, 823 S.W.2d 259, 272 (Tex.Crim.App. 1991). The admissibility of photographs\n\nover an objection is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Sonnier v. State, 913 S.W.2d 511,\n\n518 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995). Autopsy photographs are generally admissible, unless they depict\n\f                                                                                          Espada - 9\n\nmutilation of the victim caused by the autopsy itself. Santellan, 939 S.W.2d at 172.\n\n        State’s Exhibits 92, 93, 95 - 97, and 113 are photographs taken at the Scott crime scene and\n\nintroduced though the testimony of Louis Resendez.2 State’s Exhibits 92-97 are photographs\n\nshowing Scott’s body as it was found in the living room of his apartment from different angles and\n\nat different ranges. State’s Exhibit 113 is a photograph showing a bullet fragment found lodged\n\nbeneath the carpet in Scott’s living room.\n\n        State’s Exhibits 159-164 are photographs that were taken at the Ramos crime scene and\n\nintroduced through the testimony of Detective Titus. The photographs were taken from different\n\nangles and different ranges and focus on different aspects of the crime scene, including the evidence\n\nof a struggle, the tape used to bind Ramos’ hands and feet, and the plastic bag twisted around her\n\nhead.\n\n        State’s exhibits 3, 172-176, and 179 are autopsy photographs of Scott that were introduced\n\nduring the testimony of medical examiner Dr. Diane Kimberly Molina. State’s Exhibit 3 is a\n\nphotograph of Scott from the shoulders up with a numbered placard that was used as the\n\nidentification photo for the autopsy file. State’s Exhibits 172-176 are autopsy photographs showing\n\nthe bullet entrance and exit wounds on Scott’s head. State’s Exhibit 179 shows the damage done\n\nto Scott’s brain with the skull refracted. Dr. Molina testified that the skull was refracted in that\n\nphotograph in order to show the damage to the brain that could not be seen otherwise.\n\n        State’s Exhibits 180-189B are photographs taken during the autopsy of Sandra Ramos and\n\nintroduced during Dr. Molina’s testimony. State’s Exhibit 180 is an autopsy identification\n\n\n        2\n          Only photocopies of the photographs, in which some details were indistinguishable,\nwere included in the record on appeal. However, pursuant to TEX . R. APP . PROC. 51(d), the Clerk\nof this Court obtained the original exhibits for our inspection.\n\f                                                                                       Espada - 10\n\nphotograph of Ramos from the shoulders up with the corresponding file number showing on a\n\nplacard. State’s Exhibit 186 is a close-up photograph of the laceration on the right side of Ramos’s\n\nhead above the ear. State’s Exhibits 181-185 and 187-189B are autopsy photographs taken from\n\ndifferent angles and ranges showing how the plastic bag was twisted around Ramos’s head, how her\n\nhands and feet were bound, and how duct tape was circled around her head, over her face, and into\n\nher mouth.\n\n       The crime-scene photographs reflect the fact and the manner of the victims’ deaths and are\n\nno more gruesome than the offenses themselves. The photographs depict facts that had been testified\n\nto by witnesses at trial and which were relevant to the manner in which the offenses were committed.\n\nSome of the photos were closeup and showed the details of the damage sustained by the victims.\n\nAppellant urges that photographs of Ramos should have been excluded because they show early\n\nstages of decomposition that was the result of decay rather than the cause of death. The medical\n\nexaminer did explain to the jury that Ramos’s body had begun to decompose and that the autopsy\n\nphotographs depicted the body at the time it was received at the morgue. The autopsy photos of both\n\nScott and Ramos show the condition of the bodies and the wounds received and, except for State’s\n\nExhibit 179, do not show any mutilation of the bodies. State’s Exhibit 179 shows Scott’s brain with\n\nthe skull refracted, which Dr. Molina explained was necessary to clearly show the damage the bullet\n\ndid to Scott’s brain. Because Dr. Molina needed the photograph to show an injury that was\n\notherwise not visible, showing refraction of the skull is not fatal to the admissibility of State’s\n\nExhibit 179. See Harris v. State, 661 S.W.2d 106, 108 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983) (explaining that\n\nbecause refracting the skin from a victim’s skull did not “obfuscate the results of the crime” but\n\nallowed the jury to see the injury, there was no error in admitting the photograph). Contrary to\n\f                                                                                             Espada - 11\n\nappellant’s position, depiction of a victim’s body at the precise time of death is not a prerequisite for\n\nadmissibility of photographs, nor is it fatal to the admissibility when photos show decomposition.\n\nSee Madden v. State, 799 S.W.2d 683, 697 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (deciding that photographs were\n\nadmissible despite showing decomposition and change caused by submersion in water for five days);\n\nKnoppa v. State, 505 S.W.2d 802, 803 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974) (determining that photographs\n\nshowing the presence of decomposition and maggots on the body were admissible).\n\n        Considering all factors, we cannot conclude that the probative value of the photographs was\n\nsubstantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect, etc. The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin admitting the photographs at trial. Point of error twenty-seven is overruled.\n\n                                SUPPLEMENTAL JURY CHARGE\n\n        In his first point of error, appellant alleges that the trial court committed error in its\n\nsupplemental charge to the jury. During deliberations on guilt or innocence, the jury sent a note to\n\nthe trial court asking, “During the sentencing phase, will we have access to the evidence?” The trial\n\ncourt related the contents of the note to all parties and informed them of the proposed supplemental\n\ncharge: “In response to your note, I instruct you as follows: The answer is yes. Please continue your\n\ndeliberations.” The trial court asked whether there were any objections to this supplemental charge,\n\nand neither the defense nor the State objected.\n\n        When a trial court responds substantively to a jury question during deliberations, that\n\ncommunication essentially amounts to an additional or supplemental jury instruction. See Daniell\n\nv. State, 848 S.W.2d 145, 147 (Tex.Crim.App.1993). Article 36.14, which governs the court’s\n\ncharge, provides in relevant part: “the judge shall . . . deliver to the jury . . . a written charge\n\ndistinctly setting forth the law applicable to the case.” Article 36.14 does not authorize the trial court\n\f                                                                                          Espada - 12\n\nto give instructions with regard to factual matters, but only to applicable law.\n\n       Because appellant did not object, any error in the jury charge does not result in reversal\n\n“unless it was so egregious and created such harm that appellant was denied a fair trial.” Almanza\n\nv. State, 686 S.W.2d 157, 171(Tex. Crim. App. 1984) (op. on reh’g). To determine “egregious\n\nharm,” we examine “the entire jury charge, the state of the evidence, including the contested issues\n\nand weight of the probative evidence, the arguments of counsel, and any other relevant information\n\nrevealed by the record of the trial as a whole.” Id. Appellant must have suffered actual, rather than\n\ntheoretical, harm. Arline v. State, 721 S.W.2d 348, 352 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996). “Errors that result\n\nin egregious harm are those that affect ‘the very basis of the case,’ ‘deprive the defendant of a\n\nvaluable right,’ or ‘vitally affect a defensive theory.’” Hutch v. State, 922 S.W.2d 166, 171 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1996).\n\n       Appellant argues that the trial court’s supplemental charge destroyed his presumption of\n\ninnocence, relieved the State of its burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt, conveyed\n\nthe trial court’s opinion regarding the merits of the case to the jury, deprived appellant of his right\n\nto an impartial judge, undermined the bifurcated system of the death penalty trial, and sanctioned\n\njury misconduct.\n\n       Assuming for the sake of argument that there was error in the supplemental charge, we find\n\nno “egregious harm.”      First, looking at the entire jury charge, we find that the charge at\n\nguilt/innocence properly instructed the jury. During deliberations, the trial court responded to a\n\nstraightforward question from the jury with a straightforward answer that addressed the question\n\nposed. The jury asked whether it would have access to evidence during punishment deliberations,\n\nand the trial court responded that it would. The trial court’s response did not instruct the jury on a\n\f                                                                                          Espada - 13\n\nfactual matter regarding the evidence or on the merits of the case. Compare Daniell, 848 S.W.2d\n\nat 147 (finding that the trial judge’s substantive response to the jury that there were no correctional\n\nfacilities available in Hill County constituted an improper instruction on a factual matter) with Green\n\nv. State, 912 S.W.2d 189, 193-94 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (determining that the trial court’s response\n\nto the jury that a witness “never used the term ‘emotional problems’!” neither expressed the trial\n\ncourt’s opinion regarding the testimony nor instructed the jury on a factual matter).\n\n       A review of the evidence shows that the jury heard appellant’s own statements to police in\n\nwhich he admitted killing both Scott and Ramos. Further, through defense counsel’s arguments, the\n\njury was well aware of the probability of a punishment phase. In fact, counsel admitted to the jury\n\nthat “we all understand which part of a trial like this is going to be important” and explained that\n\nfollowing punishment, jurors would be able to speak with him. Counsel further told jurors that he\n\nwanted them “very seriously to go through the evidence in this case and be familiar with it. Because\n\nat the punishment phase in a case like this we talked about those questions and the answers to those\n\nquestions. The evidence of the case is very important.”\n\n       In this case, the trial court’s response did not destroy appellant’s presumption of innocence\n\nand did not relieve the State of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court’s\n\nresponse had no bearing on the bifurcated system of the death-penalty trial, nor did it sanction any\n\nsort of jury misconduct. Finally, the trial court’s response expressed no opinion regarding the merits\n\nof the case and did not deprive appellant of an impartial judge. The record does not show that\n\nappellant suffered egregious harm from the supplemental charge. Point of error one is overruled.\n\n                                      EXPERT TESTIMONY\n\n       In point of error two, appellant argues that the trial court erred, at the punishment stage, in\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 14\n\nadmitting the testimony of Dr. Richard Coons, a psychiatrist, on the subject of appellant’s future\n\ndangerousness.3 Appellant argues that Coons’s testimony “failed to satisfy any of the criteria for\n\nadmissibility” under Texas Rule of Evidence 702.4 More specifically, appellant argues that Coons:\n\n(1) “never authored a paper on the subject of future dangerousness”; (2) “had no ‘hard core data’ to\n\nsupport his opinion”; (3) had . . . no research to confirm the error rate of his previous predictions of\n\nfuture dangerousness”; and (4) “[was] [u]nable to cite any established body of scientific work on the\n\nprediction of future dangerousness.”\n\n          Before allowing Coons to testify before the jury, the trial court held a hearing outside the\n\npresence of the jury on the question of the admissibility of Coons’s testimony under Rule 702. At\n\nthat hearing, Coons testified that: (1) he was a board-certified psychiatrist with thirty-one years of\n\nexperience in forensic psychiatry; (2) in the course of his career, he had “evaluated” more than 7,000\n\npersons charged with crimes; (3) taking various factors into account, he could oftentimes formulate\n\nan opinion regarding a defendant’s future dangerousness; (4) he did not know his rate of error; (5)\n\nhis opinion regarding a defendant’s future dangerousness was ultimately based on his professional\n\ntraining and experience; (6) among the factors he considered were the defendant’s personality, the\n\ndefendant’s history of violence, the defendant’s attitude toward violence, the nature of the crime in\n\nquestion, the defendant’s “behavior patterns” during his lifetime, the defendant’s physical abilities,\n\n\n\n          3\n              Coons testified before the jury that, more likely than not, appellant would be a future\ndanger.\n          4\n          Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in admitting Coons’s testimony because\nthat testimony was “so unreliable as to violate the Due Process clause of the Constitution of the\nUnited States.” The record reflects, however, that appellant neither raised, nor received a ruling\non, this argument in the trial court. Therefore, this argument is not preserved for appellate\nreview. See Tex. R. App. Proc. 33.1.\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 15\n\nwhether the defendant has expressed remorse, whether the defendant has a conscience to help him\n\ncontrol his behavior, and the defendant’s probable future location (prison); (7) other professionals\n\nused the same factors in assessing future dangerousness; (8) his methodology was not based on any\n\nspecific scientific study; (9) it is impossible to conduct accurate scientific research regarding capital\n\ndefendants’ future dangerousness because such defendants “go to death row”; (10) it is impossible\n\nto “get the same level of hard data reliability [about future dangerousness] that you can [get] in [the]\n\nhard sciences”; (11) he had attended many professional seminars concerning future dangerousness\n\nbut had written no papers on that subject; (12) he had read much about, and had consulted many\n\nother professionals about, future dangerousness; (13) “psychiatrists are called upon to make\n\njudgments about people’s [future] dangerousness all the time,” e.g., before “commit[ting] somebody\n\n[involuntarily to a mental institution], we’re asked to determine whether they’re likely to be\n\ndangerous to themselves or others”; (14) psychiatrists “rely on history to make predictions about the\n\nfuture”; and (15) psychiatrists “can reach conclusions [about future dangerousness], and do [so] all\n\nthe time, about people who are charged with crimes.” Appellant offered no evidence to rebut\n\nCoons’s testimony but argued that his testimony was inadmissible nevertheless because his\n\n“methodology of making predictions of future dangerousness [was] not based upon a scientific\n\nfoundation” and “he [could] not identify any error rates or things like that.”\n\n        An appellate court may not disturb a trial court’s evidentiary ruling absent an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Winegarner v. State, 235 S.W.3d 787, 790 (Tex.Crim.App. 2007). In other words, if the\n\ntrial court’s ruling is supported by the record and is correct under any applicable legal theory, it must\n\nbe upheld. Ibid. In addition, an appellate court reviewing a trial court’s evidentiary ruling must do\n\nso in light of the arguments, information, and evidence before the trial court at the time it ruled.\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 16\n\nDragoo v. State, 96 S.W.3d 308, 313 (Tex.Crim.App. 2003).\n\n       Rule 702 provides: “If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier\n\nof fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\n\nknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or\n\notherwise.” Generally speaking, under Rule 702, the proponent of scientific evidence must show,\n\nby clear and convincing proof, that the evidence he is offering is sufficiently relevant and reliable\n\nto assist the jury in accurately understanding other evidence or in determining a fact in issue.\n\nHernandez v. State, 116 S.W.3d 26, 30 (Tex.Crim.App. 2003); Weatherred v. State, 15 S.W.3d 540,\n\n542 (Tex.Crim.App. 2000). The reliability of soft-science evidence, such as was offered in this case,\n\nmay be established by showing that : (1) the field of expertise is a legitimate one, (2) the subject\n\nmatter of the expert’s testimony is within the scope of that field, and (3) the expert’s testimony\n\nproperly relies upon or utilizes the principles involved in that field. Russeau v. State, 171 S.W.3d\n\n871, 883 (Tex.Crim.App. 2005); Nenno v. State, 970 S.W.2d 549, 561 (Tex.Crim.App. 1998).\n\n       On this record, we discern no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in its admission\n\nof Coons’s testimony. Given the arguments, information, and evidence before the trial court at the\n\ntime it ruled, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that psychiatry was a legitimate field\n\nof expertise, that predicting future dangerousness was within the scope of psychiatry, and that\n\nCoons’s testimony would properly rely upon the principles involved in psychiatry. Coons testified\n\nthat he was an experienced psychiatrist, that psychiatrists are called upon to make predictions of\n\nfuture dangerousness “all the time,” and that they do so utilizing such factors as he set forth.\n\nAppellant offered no evidence to rebut Coons’s testimony. The fact that Coons did not know his rate\n\nof error is not dispositive. Nenno v. State, 970 S.W.2d at 561. We overrule point of error two.\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 17\n\n        In point of error three, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony\n\nof expert witness A.P. Merillat regarding the violent acts and presence of gangs in the prison system.\n\nAppellant claims that Merillat’s testimony was unfairly prejudicial and deprived him of the right to\n\nan individualized determination of his sentence.\n\n        On voir dire examination, Merillat told the trial court that he could testify regarding the\n\nopportunities that exist in the penitentiary for a person to be violent as well as the existence and\n\nrecruiting procedures for gangs in the penitentiary. Merillat stated that he could testify about capital\n\nmurderers who received life sentences and who have committed violent crimes or have been\n\nprosecuted for drug offenses.\n\n        Appellant objected that “any of the testimony that [Merillat] would make could have an effect\n\nof being so highly prejudicial against [appellant] to outweigh its probative value.” Appellant also\n\nobjected that Merillat’s testimony would “be invading the province of the jury by explaining to the\n\njury these things in regards to generally, but nothing is going to be specific to my client that’s going\n\nto be relevant to answer either Question Number One or Question Number Two of the special\n\nissues.”\n\n        The trial court partially ruled in favor of appellant, telling Merillat:\n\n        I will permit you to testify based on your expertise of prison life, violent acts going\n        on in prison; that people can commit those types of acts. I will also permit you to\n        testify that gangs exist in prison. Beyond that, the odds of the defendant joining a\n        gang, being pressured into a gang, at least at this point, I’m not going to let in. I\n        think the prejudicial effect really outweighs any probative value given the complete\n        lack of any gang affiliation with this defendant.\n\n        Merillat then testified before the jury, first explaining how the classification system within\n\nthe penitentiary is based on the length of an inmate’s sentence rather than his offense and describing\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 18\n\nhow, based on an inmate’s classification, it is determined whether an inmate is allowed to work, go\n\nto school and other programs, have visitation, or even have a cellmate. Merillat explained that a\n\ncapital murderer would not automatically be placed in administrative segregation upon entering the\n\nprison system, but would be in the general population. Merillat described for the jury the types of\n\nviolent crimes that happen in prisons and confirmed that gangs do exist in prison.\n\n        Merillat’s testimony comported with the trial court’s ruling, which directly addressed\n\nappellant’s objection at trial. Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion. Point of error three is overruled.\n\n                                 FAILURE TO GRANT MISTRIAL\n\n        In his point of error seven, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a\n\nmistrial following the State’s introduction of unfairly prejudicial evidence regarding information\n\nobtained from a cellular-phone address book during the guilt/innocence phase. In point of error nine,\n\nappellant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial following several prejudicial\n\nsidebar comments by the State during the punishment phase.\n\n        A mistrial is appropriate for “highly prejudicial and incurable errors.” Simpson v. State, 119\n\nS.W.3d 262, 272 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). We review the denial of a motion for mistrial under an\n\nabuse of discretion standard. Hawkins v. State, 135 S.W.3d 72, 77 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). When\n\nconsidering whether a trial court abused its discretion in denying a mistrial, we look to: (1) the\n\nseverity of the misconduct (the magnitude of the prejudicial effect); (2) the measures adopted to cure\n\nthe misconduct (the effectiveness of any cautionary instruction by the judge); and (3) the certainty\n\nof conviction absent the misconduct. Id.\n\n        During the testimony of San Antonio Police Department Detective Elizabeth Greiner, the\n\f                                                                                         Espada - 19\n\nState elicited testimony that she had found a cellular phone believed to belong to appellant in his\n\nbackpack. Greiner copied the phone’s address book; she testified that one entry stood out to her.\n\nGreiner testified that the entry was “Kill U 1 Day.” The defense objected, and the State conceded\n\nthat the listing was not connected to either Scott or Ramos, but belonged to the former boyfriend of\n\nappellant’s girlfriend. The trial court sustained the defense objection and instructed the jury to\n\ndisregard the testimony, but denied a motion for a mistrial.\n\n       During punishment, the defense called jail inmates Mario A. Rocha, Juan Martinez, and\n\nImmanuel Cotton to testify on appellant’s behalf regarding his behavior in jail. When Rocha\n\nexplained a prior conviction for forgery in a way that minimized his actual participation in the\n\noffense, the prosecutor remarked, “My God. You’ve never done anything wrong in your life, have\n\nyou? Besides Noah you must be the most misunderstood person in this room, sir.” The defense\n\nobjected. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard, but it denied\n\na motion for mistrial. Martinez testified that he thought man as well as God could forgive crimes,\n\nand the prosecutor responded, “Not some of the people in this room, sir.” Again, the defense\n\nobjected, and the trial court sustained the objection. The jury was given an instruction to disregard,\n\nbut the trial court denied the defense motion for a mistrial. Finally, during Cotton’s testimony, the\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n       [State:]        I guess when you saw the defendant rip that disciplinary report up, I\n                       don’t guess you saw him looking over at you and the other inmates\n                       there in the dayroom laughing and smiling about it, [did] you?\n\n       [Cotton:]       No, ma’am.\n\n       [State:]        I didn’t think so.\n\nDefense counsel objected once again. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 20\n\nto disregard, but denied the defense motion for mistrial.\n\n       In each of the complained-of instances, the trial court immediately instructed the jury that it\n\nwas to disregard the testimony or comments. During the guilt phase, the jury had before it the\n\nstatements appellant made to police admitting he had killed Ramos and Scott; detailing how he had\n\nstalked Scott to his apartment complex; explaining that he had killed Ramos because he still wanted\n\nto kill Scott and did not want to get caught; and describing how he had waited in the dark for Scott\n\nto return home. During the punishment phase, the jury heard further testimony of how appellant had\n\ntold others he intended to kill Scott and of how appellant behaved while in custody.\n\n       In each of the complained-of instances, the trial court gave the jury an instruction to disregard\n\nwhich, under the circumstances, was sufficient to cure any error. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motions for mistrial in any of these situations. Points of error seven and\n\nnine are overruled.\n\n                           IMPROPER EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE\n\n       In point of error eight, appellant alleges that the trial court, at the punishment stage,\n\nimproperly excluded the testimony of Nicole Barton regarding Scott’s behavior toward his\n\nemployees. Appellant argues that Barton’s testimony was offered to rebut evidence presented by the\n\nState and was relevant to mitigate appellant’s sentence.\n\n       During the punishment phase, the defense called Barton, a former Poly Esther’s employee\n\nwho had worked for Scott. Barton testified that she worked for Scott at the nightclub in 2000 or\n\n2001 when she was 18 or 19 years old, that Scott was a “tyrant,” and that he treated employees as\n\nthough they were expendable. The State objected when the defense attempted to question Barton\n\nregarding why she developed her opinion of Scott. The State objected that Barton’s testimony was\n\f                                                                                          Espada - 21\n\nirrelevant, too remote in time, and prohibited under Texas Rule of Evidence 404.\n\n       Appellant proffered testimony from Barton that he wanted admitted in evidence. Outside the\n\npresence of the jury, Barton stated that Scott made her cry and belittled her. She described one\n\noccasion when she was working but was in extreme pain. She testified that she could not breathe\n\nand needed to vomit but that Scott told her that if she left she would be fired. Barton discovered that\n\nshe had a kidney stone and needed medical treatment. Barton described how Scott berated the\n\nbarbacks, told them that they were expendable, and never told them they did a good job. Barton\n\ntestified that she quit after working at the nightclub for only six months. She described one evening\n\nwhen she returned to the nightclub to pick up a security guard with whom she had a personal\n\nrelationship. According to Barton, Scott told her to stay away from his business, that she had no\n\nright to be there, and that if any security guards were seen with her, they would be fired. The trial\n\ncourt sustained the State’s objection, ruling:\n\n       I’m going to find that her testimony, given the remoteness of when this occurred,\n       years ago; that she doesn’t know the defendant; she’s never met the defendant; she\n       was never a witness to any actions between the defendant and the complainant; is too\n       far removed. That the prejudicial effect of the testimony clearly outweighs the\n       probative value. And I don’t believe it’s relevant at this point.\n\n       A trial court, at the penalty stage of a capital-murder trial, has wide discretion in admitting\n\nor excluding evidence. Ford v. State, 919 S.W.2d 107, 114 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); Lane v. State,\n\n822 S.W.2d 35,41 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). During the punishment “proceeding, evidence may be\n\npresented by the State and the defendant ... as to any matter that the court deems relevant to\n\nsentence.” Art. 37.071, § 2(a)(1). Relevant evidence is evidence that has a tendency to make the\n\nexistence of any fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. TEX . R. EVID .\n\n401. Evidence that is not relevant is not admissible. TEX . R. EVID . 402.\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 22\n\n       Here, the trial court determined that the evidence the defense offered was not relevant.\n\nBarton’s interactions with Scott occurred several years before his death. Barton quit her employment\n\nlong before appellant began working at Poly Esther’s. Barton did not know appellant and had never\n\nwitnessed any exchanges between Scott and appellant. Because this testimony did not tend to make\n\nthe existence of any fact regarding Scott’s interactions with appellant more or less probable, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding Nicole Barton’s testimony. Point of error eight is\n\noverruled.\n\n                FAILURE TO GIVE ARTICLE 37.071, § 2(f)(3), INSTRUCTION\n\n       In his fourth point of error, appellant complains that the trial court, when instructing the jury\n\nregarding the mitigation special issue, failed to give the instruction contained in Article 37.071, §\n\n2(f)(3). At punishment, the trial court instructed the jury:\n\n       The Second Issue is:\n\n       State whether, taking into consideration all the evidence, including the circumstances\n       of the offense, the defendant’s character and background, and the personal moral\n       culpability of the defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or are\n       sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment\n       rather than a death sentence be imposed.\n\nHowever, jurors were not instructed that they “need not agree on what particular evidence supports\n\nan affirmative finding on the issue” regarding the mitigation special issue. Art. 37.071, § 2(f)(3).\n\n       Appellant argues that the charge robbed him of the safeguard of having jurors made\n\nunambiguously aware that they did not need to agree on the particular evidence that supported a\n\n“yes” answer to the mitigation issue. Appellant further argues that the instruction skewed the jury’s\n\nunderstanding in the prosecution’s favor. As we understand appellant’s argument, he is complaining\n\nthat he was denied the constitutional guarantee of jury unanimity.\n\f                                                                                             Espada - 23\n\n       Appellant did not object to the charge, but now contends that the lack of the instruction\n\negregiously harmed him under the standard set out in Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171. Appellant relies\n\non Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367 (1988), to support his argument that the lack of the Article\n\n37.071, § 2(f)(3), instruction requires reversal. The charge in Mills listed the statutorily available\n\nmitigating circumstances in that case and directed jurors to unanimously affirm whether they agreed\n\nor disagreed that each circumstance did or did not exist. Id. at 378. The United States Supreme\n\nCourt found that such a charge as given may have required that all jurors unanimously agree on the\n\nmitigating circumstances before finding that they warranted a life sentence. Id. at 384. However,\n\neven when presented with the circumstances in Mills, the Supreme Court did not go as far as to say\n\nthat it is a constitutional requirement that every jury deliberating punishment in a capital case should\n\nbe explicitly instructed that they need not agree on the particular mitigating circumstances.\n\n       In this case, while jurors were not given the statutorily required instruction that they need not\n\nagree on the particular mitigating evidence, they unanimously found that no sufficient mitigating\n\ncircumstance or circumstances warranted that a life sentence be imposed. The foreman signed the\n\nanswer that stated: “We, the jury, unanimously find and determine that the answer to this Special\n\nIssue is ‘No.’” Because no juror believed there was a circumstance or circumstances that warranted\n\na life sentence, there was no possibility that the jurors would be confused about a need to agree on\n\na particular circumstance or circumstances.\n\n       Although the trial court erred in failing to give the statutory instruction, in this case appellant\n\nwas not deprived of the constitutional guarantee of a unanimous verdict and did not suffer egregious\n\nharm from the trial court’s failure to include the Article 37.071, § 2(f)(3), instruction. Nor was\n\nappellant denied a fair trial. Point of error four is overruled.\n\f                                                                                         Espada - 24\n\n                INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING VICTIM IMPACT EVIDENCE\n\n       In point of error eleven, appellant alleges that the trial court violated the Eighth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments by failing to provide requested instructions regarding victim-impact\n\nevidence to the jury at punishment.\n\n       Appellant complains first that the jury should have been instructed that its consideration of\n\nvictim-impact evidence should not be conducted in connection with the future dangerousness special\n\nissue. This requested instruction, however, is a misstatement of the law. This Court has said that\n\nvictim-impact evidence is relevant to the future dangerousness special issue if a defendant could\n\nhave reasonably foreseen the impact of the victim’s death on others. See Jackson v. State, 33 S.W.3d\n\n828, 833-34 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n       Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in refusing “to instruct the jury to disregard\n\nvictim impact evidence that was not shown to be within the knowledge or reasonable expectation\n\nof the defendant.” Appellant argues that the trial court should have given such a limiting instruction\n\nbecause he could not have had any specific knowledge regarding the impact of the victims’ deaths\n\non their parents and other loved ones. We reject appellant’s argument. Victim impact evidence is\n\nrelevant to the mitigation special issue regardless of whether, at the time of the murders, the\n\ndefendant was, or reasonably should have been, aware of the impact the victims’ deaths might have\n\non others. See Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 261 n. 16 (Tex.Crim.App. 1998). Therefore, the\n\ntrial court would have erred in giving the requested instruction.\n\n       Appellant additionally complains that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that its\n\nconsideration of victim-impact evidence did not relieve the State of its burden to prove future\n\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. This requested instruction is not required by the law.\n\f                                                                                          Espada - 25\n\nThe jury was instructed that the State was required to prove future dangerousness beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and we presume the jury followed the instructions it was given. Cobarrubio v.\n\nState, 675 S.W.2d 749, 752 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983). During its argument to the jury at punishment\n\nregarding future dangerousness, the State did not dwell on the victim-impact testimony given by the\n\nvictims’ families. Rather, the State concentrated on the circumstances surrounding the victims’\n\ndeaths and appellant’s actions afterwards. In addition to the facts of the offense, the State presented\n\nevidence that, shortly after being jailed for the instant offense, appellant attacked another inmate.\n\nAppellant was found with drugs and weapons in his jail cell, and, even after the trial process had\n\nbegun, he tore up a disciplinary report and physically assaulted a jail guard.\n\n         Finally, Appellant complains that the trial court refused to instruct the jury not to make a\n\ncomparative worth analysis of the value of the victims to their families and the community compared\n\nto the defendant or other members of society. Appellant complains that the State encouraged the jury\n\nto make such a comparison during closing argument at punishment and should have therefore been\n\ninstructed not to make a comparative worth analysis. Appellant argues that the State asked the jury\n\nto “decide what to do with one life because of the two lives that he took” and to “give Luke and\n\nSandra the same amount of consideration.” Appellant contends that the State asked the jury to\n\ncompare and contrast him with Luke and Sandra when the prosecutor stated: “And when you’re\n\nback there and you’re looking at those photos of the defendant, and you’re comparing and you’re\n\nthinking about the defendant and about Luke and Sandra, ask yourself this: What is one of the major\n\ndifferences between the defendant and Luke and Sandra[?]” Appellant complains that the jury was\n\nimproperly urged to “give them, Sandra and Luke, the consideration that he did not give them in\n\nlife.”\n\f                                                                                       Espada - 26\n\n       Appellant, however, mischaracterizes the State’s arguments to the jury. During closing\n\narguments at punishment, the State argued to the jury:\n\n               Ladies and gentlemen, over the last couple of days you’ve had an opportunity\n       to hear a great deal about the defendant, about his family, about his background,\n       about his upbringing. But right now I’d like to take the opportunity to turn your\n       attention back to why we’re here.\n\n               You’re here right now to decide what to do with one life because of the two\n       lives that he took. So I want you to think about Luke and Sandra during your\n       deliberations. This is certainly the time for you all to remember them.\n\n               And when you go back to the jury room, you’re going to have a stack of\n       photographs that the defense has admitted, photos of the defendant when he was a\n       child, with his family. And you’re going to be able to look at those.\n\n                                              ***\n\n              And when you’re back there and you’re looking at those photos of the\n       defendant, and you’re comparing and you’re thinking about the defendant and about\n       Luke and Sandra, ask yourself this: What is one of the major differences between the\n       defendant and Luke and Sandra during this trial?\n\n              Isn’t the major difference that he has had an opportunity to explain to you\n       why his life should be spared? Did Luke have that opportunity? No. The defendant\n       decided that Luke Scott needed to die.\n\n                                              ***\n\n                What about Sandra? Actually, we know Sandra did have an opportunity. She\n       had an opportunity to explain why he should spare her life. He gave her 30 minutes\n       to talk to him. ... Her pleas for her life fell on his deaf ears.\n\n                But now he has the opportunity – his family has the opportunity to plead for\n       his life.\n\n               So I’m going to ask you that while you’re back there and you’re deliberating,\n       that you give them, Sandra and Luke, the consideration that he did not give them in\n       life.\n\n       The State did not ask the jury to make a comparative worth analysis of the value of the\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 27\n\nvictims to their families and the community compared to appellant or other members of society.\n\nRather, the State personalized the victims just as the defense personalized appellant. On this record,\n\nand in the absence of a statutory requirement directing that the jury be instructed as appellant argues\n\nregarding victim-impact evidence, the trial court committed no error in not giving these instructions\n\nto the jury. Point of error eleven is overruled.\n\n                                           DEFINITIONS\n\n       In points of error twelve, thirteen, and fifteen, appellant complains that the trial court failed\n\nto define “probability,” “criminal acts of violence,” and “continuing threat to society” for the jury\n\nduring the punishment phase. In point of error fourteen, appellant argues that the trial court erred\n\nin failing to define the word “militates” so as to preclude consideration of the defendant’s age, race,\n\nsex, national origin, religion, political views, or sexual orientation as a factor supporting a death\n\nsentence. This Court has previously stated that words and phrases that are not statutorily defined\n\nare to be given their usual meanings and no specific instructions are required for those words or\n\nphrases. Blue v. State, 125 S.W.3d 491, 504-05 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003); Martinez v. State, 924\n\nS.W.2d 693, 698 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); Garcia v. State, 887 S.W.2d 846, 859 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1994); Earhart v. State, 877 S.W.2d 759, 767 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994). Appellant has provided us\n\nwith no reason to revisit the issue here. Points of error twelve, thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen are\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error twenty-three, appellant complains that the trial court unconstitutionally\n\ncharged the jury in language that “trivialized the value of life” and increased the likelihood that a\n\ndeath sentence would be imposed. Appellant specifically argues that using the terms “probability,”\n\n“threat,” and “continuing” without proper explanation trivializes the value of human life and the\n\f                                                                                              Espada - 28\n\nlegal process used to choose between life and death. This Court has previously rejected claims that\n\nthe Texas capital sentencing scheme is unconstitutional for failing to define the terms “probability”\n\nand “continuing threat to society.” Escamilla v. State, 143 S.W.3d 814, 828 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\nPoint of error twenty-three is overruled.\n\n                                 THE CHARGE AT PUNISHMENT\n\n        In point of error sixteen, appellant complains that the trial court failed to instruct the jury so\n\nas to limit the scope of militating evidence to that which a juror might regard as increasing\n\nappellant’s moral blameworthiness. Appellant appears to argue that, because the trial court did not\n\ngive this instruction, the jury could have sentenced him based on his religious and insular\n\nupbringing, thus removing the jury’s focus from his culpability and denying him an individualized\n\nconsideration prior to imposing a death sentence. There are no constitutional or legislative\n\nrequirements for an instruction that limits the scope of militating evidence to that which the jury\n\nmight consider as increasing a defendant’s moral culpability. Further, the State’s arguments to the\n\njury regarding both the future dangerousness and mitigation special issues focused on appellant’s\n\nactions and appellant’s blameworthiness. There were no arguments presented that encouraged the\n\njury to consider any evidence other than that which indicated increased moral culpability on the part\n\nof appellant. Point of error sixteen is overruled.\n\n        In point of error seventeen, appellant complains that the trial court failed to instruct jurors\n\nthat the finding of guilt in the first phase of trial did not foreclose consideration of evidence that they\n\nbelieved tended to reduce appellant’s moral blameworthiness. At punishment, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury that it was to “consider all the evidence in this case” and that it was to “consider\n\nall evidence admitted at the guilt or innocence and the punishment stage, including evidence of the\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 29\n\ndefendant’s background or character or the circumstances of the offense that militates for or\n\nmitigates against the imposition of the death penalty.” While the trial court’s instruction to the jury\n\ndid not track appellant’s requested language, the instruction given accomplished the same goal. The\n\ntrial court did not commit error. Point of error seventeen is overruled.\n\n        In point of error eighteen, appellant alleges that the trial court violated the Eighth\n\nAmendment by failing to instruct the jury that there is no presumption in favor of death. Appellant\n\nargues that the jury should have been instructed that even if they found appellant a future danger in\n\nresponse to the first special issue, the mitigation special issue was to be considered independently\n\nwithout regard to the jury’s finding regarding the first special issue.\n\n        Article 37.071 provides that a jury may not consider the mitigation special issue until it\n\naffirmatively answers the future dangerousness special issue. Further, once the jury reached the\n\nmitigation special issue, it was entitled to, and even required, to consider all of the evidence. Article\n\n37.071 does not require a specific instruction spelling this out to the jury. Nor does anything in this\n\nrecord or the Constitution demand that such an instruction be provided. Appellant’s requested\n\ninstruction would have been a misstatement of the law. Point of error eighteen is overruled.\n\n        In point of error nineteen, appellant complains that the trial court unconstitutionally failed\n\nto instruct the jury “so as to provide a vehicle for a juror to return a life verdict where the juror\n\nconcludes that the aggravating factors, although established by the evidence, still are not so severe\n\nas to call for death as a punishment.” Appellant cites to Smith v. Texas, 543 U.S. 37 (2004), to\n\nsupport his argument that the charge “does not allow for a life sentence in the case where\n\ncircumstances exist that may lessen the applicability of the death penalty despite the existence of a\n\nfinding that the defendant will commit future acts of violence.” Appellant appears to be arguing that\n\f                                                                                             Espada - 30\n\nhe was not given a sufficient vehicle by which the jury could consider his mitigating evidence.\n\n        The Supreme Court’s decision in Smith addressed the constitutionality of a non-statutory,\n\n“nullification” special issue that effectively instructed the jury to change one of its “yes” answers to\n\none of the statutory special issues to a “no” answer if the jury believed that mitigating circumstances\n\nexisted warranting a sentence less than death. See Smith, 543 U.S. at 38-39, 45-49. The statutory\n\nmitigation special issue submitted in this case is nothing like the “nullification” instruction at issue\n\nin Smith. The statutory mitigation special issue in this case provided appellant’s jury with a vehicle\n\nto fully consider and give effect to appellant’s mitigating evidence without requiring the jury to\n\ndisregard its oath and instructions by changing its answer to the other special issue. Unlike the jury\n\nin Smith, the jury in this case could have fully considered and given effect to appellant’s mitigating\n\nevidence by providing a “yes” answer to the mitigation special issue thus resulting in a life sentence.\n\nPoint of error nineteen is overruled.\n\n        In points of error twenty-two and twenty-four, appellant alleges that the trial court’s\n\ninstructions at punishment unconstitutionally “failed to provide the jury the opportunity to have its\n\ndecision reflect a ‘reasoned moral response’” to appellant and his offense and failed to provide a\n\nsatisfactory process for considering and giving effect to mitigating circumstances. Appellant\n\nspecifically argues that the jury instructions suggest that if mitigating circumstances are not sufficient\n\nin relation to future dangerousness, a death sentence is warranted.\n\n        Under the Texas capital-sentencing scheme, when mitigating evidence is presented, jurors\n\nindividually determine what evidence, if any, mitigates against the imposition of the death penalty\n\nand what weight, if any, to give that evidence in their consideration. Threadgill v. State, 146 S.W.3d\n\n654, 671 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Article 37.071, § 2(e), provides that the jury “shall” answer the\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 31\n\nmitigation issue, which directs “considerations of all evidence, including circumstances of the\n\noffense, the defendant’s character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the\n\ndefendant.” This Court has previously determined that Article 37.071 is constitutional because it\n\nrequires the jury to consider all of the evidence and determine whether such mitigating circumstances\n\nexist as to warrant a life sentence. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 671; see also Saldano v. State, 232\n\nS.W.3d 77, 100-01 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Points of error twenty-two and twenty-four are\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error twenty-five, appellant alleges the trial court unconstitutionally failed to\n\nprovide verdict forms that gave priority to the mitigation special issue and made it independent of\n\nthe future dangerousness special issue. Appellant requested that the jury be provided verdict forms\n\nthat placed the mitigation special issue before the future dangerousness special issue and that the jury\n\nbe directed to answer the mitigation special issue before proceeding to the question of future\n\ndangerousness.\n\n       The order of the presentation of the special issues is dictated by Article 37.071, which\n\nprovides that, upon conclusion of the presentation of evidence during punishment, the trial court\n\nshall submit the special issues to the jury. The jury is instructed that if it answers the future\n\ndangerousness issue affirmatively, only then must it answer the mitigation special issue. Art. 37.071,\n\n§ 2(e). We have previously upheld the constitutionality of Article 37.071. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d\n\nat 671. Appellant does not convince us to the contrary. Point of error twenty-five is overruled.\n\n       In the twenty-sixth point of error, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in refusing to\n\ninstruct the jury that the State’s burden of persuasion to obtain a death verdict is “beyond all doubt”\n\nrather than “beyond reasonable doubt.” Appellant acknowledges that the Texas law requires the\n\f                                                                                              Espada - 32\n\n“beyond reasonable doubt” standard rather the “beyond all doubt” standard. In fact, Appellant\n\nconcedes that no state has adopted the “beyond all doubt” standard. There is no constitutional\n\nrequirement that the State be held to a “beyond all doubt” standard. See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358,\n\n364 (1970) (stating that the “Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt.”). Point of error twenty-six is overruled.\n\n                                          THE “10-12” RULE\n\n        In his tenth point of error, appellant alleges that the trial court violated the Sixth, Eighth, and\n\nFourteenth Amendments. He argues that the trial court failed to instruct jurors that a vote by one of\n\nthem would result in a life sentence despite the statutory requirements of ten votes for a “no”\n\nresponse to the question of future dangerousness, or for a “yes” response to a finding of a mitigating\n\ncircumstance. This Court has consistently upheld the “10-12” rule as constitutional. Prystash v.\n\nState, 3 S.W.3d 522,536 (1999); McFarland v. State, 928 S.W.2d 482, 519 (1996); Lawton v. State,\n\n913 S.W.2d 542, 558-59 (1995). Appellant has given us no reason to revisit this issue. Point of\n\nerror ten is overruled.\n\n                            PRECLUSION OF THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n        In point of error twenty, appellant complains that the trial court erred when it refused to\n\npreclude the death penalty as a sentencing option or to quash the indictment because the grand jury\n\ndid not allege facts legally essential to the conviction and death sentence. Appellant contends that\n\nunder Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), he\n\nhas the constitutional right to have the grand jury allege in the indictment all the specific facts legally\n\nessential to his death sentence, including facts supporting a negative response to the mitigation\n\nspecial issue. This Court has previously addressed this complaint and determined that neither\n\f                                                                                             Espada - 33\n\nApprendi nor Ring require the State to allege the special issues in the indictment. Russeau v. State,\n\n171 S.W.3d 871, 885-86 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005); Rayford v. State, 125 S.W.3d 521, 533 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2003). Point of error twenty is overruled.\n\n       In his twenty-first point of error, appellant alleges the trial court violated the Equal Protection\n\nClause by failing to preclude the death penalty as a sentencing option. Appellant complains that\n\nthere are no statewide standards to guide Texas prosecutors in deciding when they should seek the\n\ndeath penalty. This Court has previously considered and rejected this argument; appellant has given\n\nus no reason to reconsider our decision. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 671-72. Point of error twenty-\n\none is overruled.\n\n                                      CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n       In his twenty-eighth point of error, appellant urges this Court to consider the cumulative\n\nimpact of the errors presented above. While a number of errors may be found harmful in its\n\ncumulative effect, Chamberlain v. State, 998 S.W.2d 230, 238 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999), cumulative\n\nerror has not been shown here. Wright v. State, 28 S.W.3d 526, 537 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). Point\n\nof error twenty-eight is overruled.\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\nDELIVERED NOVEMBER 5, 2008\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\n\f",

M EYERS and C OCHRAN, JJ.,\n       concurred in the result of the Court’s disposition of point of error two and\n       otherwise joined in the Court’s opinion.

Paragraph A charged appellant with the capital murder of Scott under Texas\nPenal Code § 19.03(a)(2) (murder in the course of burglary), and Paragraph B charged him with\nthe capital murder of Scott under Texas Penal Code § 19.03(a)(7)(B) (murder of more than one\n                                                                                      (continued...)\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 2\n\nBased on the jury’s answers to the special issues set forth in Article 37.071, §§ 2(b) and 2(e), of the\n\nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure, the trial court sentenced appellant to death. We will affirm.\n\n                                     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       Appellant worked as a barback (i.e., a bartender’s assistant) at the “Poly Esther’s” nightclub\n\nin San Antonio for approximately four months. Luke Scott was the general manager of the\n\nnightclub. In the time appellant worked at the nightclub, he was “written up” over ten times for\n\nemployee-rule violations. Assistant Manager Trent Merrill, who directly supervised appellant,\n\ndescribed him as “lackadaisical” and said that he had “problems following rules.” Appellant seemed\n\nto blame Scott for his problems at work and told other employees that “he was going to follow\n\n[Scott] home and shoot him” and that “if you found [Scott] on the news dead, you know who did it.”\n\nOther employees overheard appellant say things such as “that bitch is going to get what he deserves”\n\nand that he was going to “follow [Scott] home and fuck him up.” Appellant believed Scott was\n\nmean and later told police that Scott treated him “like a bitch.” Eventually, on February 14, 2004,\n\nappellant was fired.\n\n       Two weeks later, appellant followed Scott home from work and parked outside the\n\napartment-complex gates so he would not be seen. Appellant was not able to see which apartment\n\nScott entered, but he saw a light on in an apartment near where Scott had parked his car. Appellant\n\nclimbed up onto the balcony of that apartment and entered through the balcony door. Once inside,\n\n\n\n       1\n        (...continued)\nperson pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct). The jury found appellant guilty under\nboth paragraphs.\n       Paragraph B alleged that appellant’s other victim was Sandra Ramos. Appellant’s murder\nof Ramos was the aggravating element that elevated his murder of Scott to a capital offense. See\nNarvaiz v.

Ramos did not know Luke Scott – appellant had entered the\n\nwrong apartment.\n\n       For nearly half an hour, Ramos spoke with appellant, attempting to defuse the situation and\n\nsave her life. Appellant “didn’t know what to do but [he] still wanted Luke. [He] didn’t want to get\n\ncaught.” Appellant hit Ramos on the back of her head with the butt of his handgun, and then bound\n\nher hands and legs with tape. Ramos regained consciousness before appellant placed a plastic trash\n\nbag over her head and tightened it. Appellant then took Ramos’s truck key and left her apartment\n\nwhile she was still alive.\n\n       A few days later, appellant returned to the apartment complex for Scott. This time, appellant\n\nclimbed onto the balcony of Scott’s apartment, cut the screen, and went through the open sliding\n\nglass door. Appellant waited in the dark for about an hour before Scott returned home. When Scott\n\nentered the apartment and walked down a hallway, appellant met him with a drawn .45 revolver.\n\nAppellant shot at Scott, and Scott tried to run away but fell. Appellant shot at Scott two more times,\n\nthe final time into the back of Scott’s head. When appellant left Scott’s apartment, he took Scott’s\n\ncar keys, watch, hand-held computer, and wallet, and then drove away in Scott’s car.\n\n                      ADMISSIBILITY OF APPELLANT’S CONFESSION\n\n       In point of error six, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in admitting his confession to\n\nthe murder of Sandra Ramos. Appellant contends that police disregarded his attempt to terminate\n\nhis interview in violation of Article 38.22 and Miranda v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966).\n\n       On July 14, 2005, the trial court held a hearing on appellant’s motion to suppress the\n\nconfession. At that hearing, the State called San Antonio Police Department Detectives Elizabeth\n\nGreiner and Robert Handowski to testify regarding the statements they took from appellant.\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 4\n\n       Greiner testified that on March 25, 2004, she executed an arrest warrant for appellant for the\n\nmurder of Luke Scott. Appellant was twice read “his rights” before making a statement in which he\n\nconfessed to Scott’s murder. Greiner testified that, at the time of appellant’s arrest, she only “felt”\n\nthat appellant was involved in Sandra Ramos’s murder. According to Greiner, that feeling developed\n\ninto actual suspicion because (1) appellant’s demeanor changed when he was asked to provide a\n\nDNA swab and (2) he was hesitant to speak with her regarding Ramos’s murder.\n\n       Greiner, not wanting to destroy any rapport she had built with appellant, concluded her\n\ninterview with him. Handowski, who had been investigating Ramos’s murder, next spoke with\n\nappellant. Handowski testified that, before beginning the interview, he again read appellant his\n\nrights. Although police did not have any evidence connecting appellant to Ramos’s death,\n\nHandowski told appellant that there was a lot of evidence in Ramos’s apartment and that he knew\n\nappellant had killed Ramos. Initially, appellant denied involvement, but when Handowski talked\n\nabout the death penalty and religion, appellant responded that he did not want to go to prison, that\n\nthere was “no pride” in being a woman killer, and that he would “embarrass members of his family\n\nand his church.” Handowski testified that he told appellant that it would be best to tell the truth and\n\nthat Ramos’ family also needed closure.\n\n       Handowski testified that there was a lull in the conversation at this point for a few minutes,\n\nduring which it appeared to him that appellant was thinking about, or considering, the situation.\n\nHandowski told appellant, “Well, let’s start with something easy, tell me what you did with her\n\nvehicle.” Appellant then told Handowski where police could find Ramos’s truck. Handowski\n\nexcused himself to ask other officers to go find the truck. When Handowski returned to the\n\ninterview room, appellant told him how Ramos’ murder occurred.\n\f                                                                                          Espada - 5\n\n       Appellant argues that the “lull in the conversation” described by Handowski was an assertion\n\nof his right to remain silent. Handowski testified, however, that while appellant did not offer\n\nanything as Handowski continued talking for a few minutes, he attributed appellant’s lack of\n\nimmediate response to guilt. Handowski also testified that at no time did appellant request\n\ntermination of the interview or ask for a lawyer. The State argued that appellant’s lack of response\n\nfor a few minutes was not an invocation of his right to silence nor an expression of his desire to\n\nterminate the interview.\n\n       The trial court agreed with the State and entered the following findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law:\n\n               1. The defendant’s statement to Detective Handowski was made while the\n       defendant was in lawful custody and prior to giving his statement, the defendant was\n       duly warned pursuant to Article 38.22 of his rights.\n               2. Given the totality of the circumstances, the Court concludes that the\n       defendant did not invoke his right to remain silent. Although the defendant was not\n       required to specifically state he was invoking his right, it is not reasonable to infer\n       that the two-minute lull in the conversation, where the defendant had already made\n       statements implicating himself and appeared to be thinking before speaking further,\n       was an invocation of his right to remain silent.\n               3. Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the defendant’s statement\n       was voluntarily made and is admissible as a matter of law and fact.\n\n       At a suppression hearing, the trial court is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and\n\nthe weight of their testimony.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118380\"><a href=\"/opinion/118380/dickerson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438-39 (2000); Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444. An accused\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 6\n\nmust also be advised that he has the right to terminate questioning. Art. 38.22, § (2)(a)(5). The\n\nstatement of an accused may be used in evidence against him if it appears that it was freely and\n\nvoluntarily made, without compulsion or persuasion. See Art. 38.21. If at any time before or during\n\nquestioning, a suspect being questioned indicates in any manner that he wishes to remain silent, the\n\ninterrogation must cease. Miranda, 384 U.S. at 473-74. A suspect does not need to use any\n\nparticular word or phrase to invoke his right to remain silent. Watson v.

Crim. App. 1996).\n\n       In this case, the trial court heard testimony during the suppression hearing from Handowski\n\nthat appellant did not affirmatively invoke his right to silence or attempt to terminate the interview.\n\nThere was an approximately two-minute lull in the conversation, during which appellant appeared\n\nto be thinking. Handowski then posed a question regarding where the police could find Ramos’s\n\ntruck. Handowski left the room to direct other officers to recover Ramos’s truck from where\n\nappellant said he left it. When Handowski returned, appellant provided a statement detailing\n\nRamos’s murder. The record supports the trial court’s decision. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting appellant’s statement confessing to Ramos’s murder. Point of error six is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                    RIGHT TO PUBLIC TRIAL\n\n       In his fifth point of error, appellant complains that portions of his voir dire proceedings were\n\nclosed to the public, thus depriving him of a public trial. Appellant describes two instances in which\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 7\n\nhe claims he was denied his right to a public trial. The first instance occurred on August 1, 2005.\n\nWith appellant present, the trial court held a hearing regarding juror Bowman, who had been selected\n\nbut not yet sworn. During that hearing, Bowman was excused because of a family bereavement.\n\nAppellant complains that this hearing, which appears to have been held in chambers, deprived him\n\nof the right to a public trial. Appellant bases his complaint on a single statement made by the trial\n\ncourt that “I’ve got all the lawyers and the defendant in my office.” There is no indication on the\n\nrecord that this was a closed hearing. There is no mention by the trial court, the State, or the defense\n\nthat members of the public or the media were prevented from attending the hearing.\n\n        In the second instance, on August 2, 2005, before proceeding to select a juror to replace\n\nBowman, the trial court stated:\n\n                Just so the record reflects this, I had a conversation with Mr. Lou Aboud. He\n        wanted to come and watch jury selection process this morning. We’ve been taken\n        out of the conference room and put in the jury room. We’re short a bailiff today. So\n        I informed him that it would not be possible for anybody to be in the jury room today\n        due to security issues. I suppose if the media wanted to come in, we could make an\n        exception, but we’re excluding family members this morning until we can get back\n        in the conference room.\n\nAppellant complains that, by closing the proceedings to family members, the trial court denied him\n\nthe right to a public trial.\n\n        The Sixth Amendment guarantees to the accused in all criminal prosecutions the right to a\n\n“public trial.” This fundamental right was extended to defendants in state criminal prosecutions\n\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment. See In re Oliver, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1948); see also Herring v.

The record reflects, however, that appellant failed to object at trial\n\nthat he was being denied the right to a public trial. Therefore, he forfeited the right to raise this\n\ncomplaint on appeal.

We overrule point of error\n\nnumber five.\n\n                                  ADMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPHS\n\n       In point of error twenty-seven, appellant claims that the trial court erroneously admitted\n\nevidence in violation of Rule 403 of the Texas Rules of Evidence. He specifically complains about\n\ncrime scene photographs (State’s Exhibits 92-93, 95-97, 113, and 159-164) and autopsy photographs\n\n(State’s Exhibits 3, 172-176, and 179-189B) that were admitted over defense objection. Appellant\n\nclaims that this evidence was “gratuitously” and unfairly prejudicial. Appellant argues that the\n\nphotographs were duplicative and show facts or circumstances that were otherwise established, thus\n\nlimiting their probative value.\n\n       Rule 403 provides: “Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\n\nthe jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” See\n\nGigliobianco v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1877704\"><a href=\"/opinion/1877704/gigliobianco-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Crim.App. 2006). A court may consider many factors\n\nin determining whether the probative value of photographs is substantially outweighed by the danger\n\nof unfair prejudice, etc. The factors include: the number of exhibits offered, their gruesomeness,\n\ntheir detail, their size, whether they are in color or black-and-white, whether they are close up,\n\nwhether the body depicted is clothed or naked, the availability of other means of proof, and other\n\ncircumstances unique to the individual case.

Santellan, 939 S.W.2d at 172.\n\n        State’s Exhibits 92, 93, 95 - 97, and 113 are photographs taken at the Scott crime scene and\n\nintroduced though the testimony of Louis Resendez.2 State’s Exhibits 92-97 are photographs\n\nshowing Scott’s body as it was found in the living room of his apartment from different angles and\n\nat different ranges. State’s Exhibit 113 is a photograph showing a bullet fragment found lodged\n\nbeneath the carpet in Scott’s living room.\n\n        State’s Exhibits 159-164 are photographs that were taken at the Ramos crime scene and\n\nintroduced through the testimony of Detective Titus. The photographs were taken from different\n\nangles and different ranges and focus on different aspects of the crime scene, including the evidence\n\nof a struggle, the tape used to bind Ramos’ hands and feet, and the plastic bag twisted around her\n\nhead.\n\n        State’s exhibits 3, 172-176, and 179 are autopsy photographs of Scott that were introduced\n\nduring the testimony of medical examiner Dr. Diane Kimberly Molina. State’s Exhibit 3 is a\n\nphotograph of Scott from the shoulders up with a numbered placard that was used as the\n\nidentification photo for the autopsy file. State’s Exhibits 172-176 are autopsy photographs showing\n\nthe bullet entrance and exit wounds on Scott’s head. State’s Exhibit 179 shows the damage done\n\nto Scott’s brain with the skull refracted. Dr. Molina testified that the skull was refracted in that\n\nphotograph in order to show the damage to the brain that could not be seen otherwise.\n\n        State’s Exhibits 180-189B are photographs taken during the autopsy of Sandra Ramos and\n\nintroduced during Dr. Molina’s testimony. State’s Exhibit 180 is an autopsy identification\n\n\n        2\n          Only photocopies of the photographs, in which some details were indistinguishable,\nwere included in the record on appeal. However, pursuant to TEX . R. APP . PROC. 51(d), the Clerk\nof this Court obtained the original exhibits for our inspection.\n\f                                                                                       Espada - 10\n\nphotograph of Ramos from the shoulders up with the corresponding file number showing on a\n\nplacard. State’s Exhibit 186 is a close-up photograph of the laceration on the right side of Ramos’s\n\nhead above the ear. State’s Exhibits 181-185 and 187-189B are autopsy photographs taken from\n\ndifferent angles and ranges showing how the plastic bag was twisted around Ramos’s head, how her\n\nhands and feet were bound, and how duct tape was circled around her head, over her face, and into\n\nher mouth.\n\n       The crime-scene photographs reflect the fact and the manner of the victims’ deaths and are\n\nno more gruesome than the offenses themselves. The photographs depict facts that had been testified\n\nto by witnesses at trial and which were relevant to the manner in which the offenses were committed.\n\nSome of the photos were closeup and showed the details of the damage sustained by the victims.\n\nAppellant urges that photographs of Ramos should have been excluded because they show early\n\nstages of decomposition that was the result of decay rather than the cause of death. The medical\n\nexaminer did explain to the jury that Ramos’s body had begun to decompose and that the autopsy\n\nphotographs depicted the body at the time it was received at the morgue. The autopsy photos of both\n\nScott and Ramos show the condition of the bodies and the wounds received and, except for State’s\n\nExhibit 179, do not show any mutilation of the bodies. State’s Exhibit 179 shows Scott’s brain with\n\nthe skull refracted, which Dr. Molina explained was necessary to clearly show the damage the bullet\n\ndid to Scott’s brain.

During deliberations, the trial court responded to a\n\nstraightforward question from the jury with a straightforward answer that addressed the question\n\nposed. The jury asked whether it would have access to evidence during punishment deliberations,\n\nand the trial court responded that it would.

Further, through defense counsel’s arguments, the\n\njury was well aware of the probability of a punishment phase. In fact, counsel admitted to the jury\n\nthat “we all understand which part of a trial like this is going to be important” and explained that\n\nfollowing punishment, jurors would be able to speak with him. Counsel further told jurors that he\n\nwanted them “very seriously to go through the evidence in this case and be familiar with it. Because\n\nat the punishment phase in a case like this we talked about those questions and the answers to those\n\nquestions. The evidence of the case is very important.”\n\n       In this case, the trial court’s response did not destroy appellant’s presumption of innocence\n\nand did not relieve the State of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court’s\n\nresponse had no bearing on the bifurcated system of the death-penalty trial, nor did it sanction any\n\nsort of jury misconduct. Finally, the trial court’s response expressed no opinion regarding the merits\n\nof the case and did not deprive appellant of an impartial judge.

At\n\nthat hearing, Coons testified that: (1) he was a board-certified psychiatrist with thirty-one years of\n\nexperience in forensic psychiatry; (2) in the course of his career, he had “evaluated” more than 7,000\n\npersons charged with crimes; (3) taking various factors into account, he could oftentimes formulate\n\nan opinion regarding a defendant’s future dangerousness; (4) he did not know his rate of error; (5)\n\nhis opinion regarding a defendant’s future dangerousness was ultimately based on his professional\n\ntraining and experience; (6) among the factors he considered were the defendant’s personality, the\n\ndefendant’s history of violence, the defendant’s attitude toward violence, the nature of the crime in\n\nquestion, the defendant’s “behavior patterns” during his lifetime, the defendant’s physical abilities,\n\n\n\n          3\n              Coons testified before the jury that, more likely than not, appellant would be a future\ndanger.\n          4\n          Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in admitting Coons’s testimony because\nthat testimony was “so unreliable as to violate the Due Process clause of the Constitution of the\nUnited States.” The record reflects, however, that appellant neither raised, nor received a ruling\non, this argument in the trial court. Therefore, this argument is not preserved for appellate\nreview. See Tex. R. App. Proc. 33.1.\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 15\n\nwhether the defendant has expressed remorse, whether the defendant has a conscience to help him\n\ncontrol his behavior, and the defendant’s probable future location (prison); (7) other professionals\n\nused the same factors in assessing future dangerousness; (8) his methodology was not based on any\n\nspecific scientific study; (9) it is impossible to conduct accurate scientific research regarding capital\n\ndefendants’ future dangerousness because such defendants “go to death row”; (10) it is impossible\n\nto “get the same level of hard data reliability [about future dangerousness] that you can [get] in [the]\n\nhard sciences”; (11) he had attended many professional seminars concerning future dangerousness\n\nbut had written no papers on that subject; (12) he had read much about, and had consulted many\n\nother professionals about, future dangerousness; (13) “psychiatrists are called upon to make\n\njudgments about people’s [future] dangerousness all the time,” e.g., before “commit[ting] somebody\n\n[involuntarily to a mental institution], we’re asked to determine whether they’re likely to be\n\ndangerous to themselves or others”; (14) psychiatrists “rely on history to make predictions about the\n\nfuture”; and (15) psychiatrists “can reach conclusions [about future dangerousness], and do [so] all\n\nthe time, about people who are charged with crimes.” Appellant offered no evidence to rebut\n\nCoons’s testimony but argued that his testimony was inadmissible nevertheless because his\n\n“methodology of making predictions of future dangerousness [was] not based upon a scientific\n\nfoundation” and “he [could] not identify any error rates or things like that.”\n\n        An appellate court may not disturb a trial court’s evidentiary ruling absent an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.

Coons testified\n\nthat he was an experienced psychiatrist, that psychiatrists are called upon to make predictions of\n\nfuture dangerousness “all the time,” and that they do so utilizing such factors as he set forth.\n\nAppellant offered no evidence to rebut Coons’s testimony.

Merillat regarding the violent acts and presence of gangs in the prison system.\n\nAppellant claims that Merillat’s testimony was unfairly prejudicial and deprived him of the right to\n\nan individualized determination of his sentence.\n\n        On voir dire examination, Merillat told the trial court that he could testify regarding the\n\nopportunities that exist in the penitentiary for a person to be violent as well as the existence and\n\nrecruiting procedures for gangs in the penitentiary. Merillat stated that he could testify about capital\n\nmurderers who received life sentences and who have committed violent crimes or have been\n\nprosecuted for drug offenses.\n\n        Appellant objected that “any of the testimony that [Merillat] would make could have an effect\n\nof being so highly prejudicial against [appellant] to outweigh its probative value.” Appellant also\n\nobjected that Merillat’s testimony would “be invading the province of the jury by explaining to the\n\njury these things in regards to generally, but nothing is going to be specific to my client that’s going\n\nto be relevant to answer either Question Number One or Question Number Two of the special\n\nissues.”\n\n        The trial court partially ruled in favor of appellant, telling Merillat:\n\n        I will permit you to testify based on your expertise of prison life, violent acts going\n        on in prison; that people can commit those types of acts. I will also permit you to\n        testify that gangs exist in prison. Beyond that, the odds of the defendant joining a\n        gang, being pressured into a gang, at least at this point, I’m not going to let in. I\n        think the prejudicial effect really outweighs any probative value given the complete\n        lack of any gang affiliation with this defendant.\n\n        Merillat then testified before the jury, first explaining how the classification system within\n\nthe penitentiary is based on the length of an inmate’s sentence rather than his offense and describing\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 18\n\nhow, based on an inmate’s classification, it is determined whether an inmate is allowed to work, go\n\nto school and other programs, have visitation, or even have a cellmate. Merillat explained that a\n\ncapital murderer would not automatically be placed in administrative segregation upon entering the\n\nprison system, but would be in the general population. Merillat described for the jury the types of\n\nviolent crimes that happen in prisons and confirmed that gangs do exist in prison.\n\n        Merillat’s testimony comported with the trial court’s ruling, which directly addressed\n\nappellant’s objection at trial. Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion.

In point of error nine,\n\nappellant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial following several prejudicial\n\nsidebar comments by the State during the punishment phase.\n\n        A mistrial is appropriate for “highly prejudicial and incurable errors.” Simpson v.

When\n\nconsidering whether a trial court abused its discretion in denying a mistrial, we look to: (1) the\n\nseverity of the misconduct (the magnitude of the prejudicial effect); (2) the measures adopted to cure\n\nthe misconduct (the effectiveness of any cautionary instruction by the judge); and (3) the certainty\n\nof conviction absent the misconduct. Id.\n\n        During the testimony of San Antonio Police Department Detective Elizabeth Greiner, the\n\f                                                                                         Espada - 19\n\nState elicited testimony that she had found a cellular phone believed to belong to appellant in his\n\nbackpack. Greiner copied the phone’s address book; she testified that one entry stood out to her.\n\nGreiner testified that the entry was “Kill U 1 Day.” The defense objected, and the State conceded\n\nthat the listing was not connected to either Scott or Ramos, but belonged to the former boyfriend of\n\nappellant’s girlfriend. The trial court sustained the defense objection and instructed the jury to\n\ndisregard the testimony, but denied a motion for a mistrial.\n\n       During punishment, the defense called jail inmates Mario A. Rocha, Juan Martinez, and\n\nImmanuel Cotton to testify on appellant’s behalf regarding his behavior in jail. When Rocha\n\nexplained a prior conviction for forgery in a way that minimized his actual participation in the\n\noffense, the prosecutor remarked, “My God. You’ve never done anything wrong in your life, have\n\nyou? Besides Noah you must be the most misunderstood person in this room, sir.” The defense\n\nobjected. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard, but it denied\n\na motion for mistrial. Martinez testified that he thought man as well as God could forgive crimes,\n\nand the prosecutor responded, “Not some of the people in this room, sir.” Again, the defense\n\nobjected, and the trial court sustained the objection. The jury was given an instruction to disregard,\n\nbut the trial court denied the defense motion for a mistrial. Finally, during Cotton’s testimony, the\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n       [State:]        I guess when you saw the defendant rip that disciplinary report up, I\n                       don’t guess you saw him looking over at you and the other inmates\n                       there in the dayroom laughing and smiling about it, [did] you?\n\n       [Cotton:]       No, ma’am.\n\n       [State:]        I didn’t think so.\n\nDefense counsel objected once again. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 20\n\nto disregard, but denied the defense motion for mistrial.\n\n       In each of the complained-of instances, the trial court immediately instructed the jury that it\n\nwas to disregard the testimony or comments. During the guilt phase, the jury had before it the\n\nstatements appellant made to police admitting he had killed Ramos and Scott; detailing how he had\n\nstalked Scott to his apartment complex; explaining that he had killed Ramos because he still wanted\n\nto kill Scott and did not want to get caught; and describing how he had waited in the dark for Scott\n\nto return home. During the punishment phase, the jury heard further testimony of how appellant had\n\ntold others he intended to kill Scott and of how appellant behaved while in custody.\n\n       In each of the complained-of instances, the trial court gave the jury an instruction to disregard\n\nwhich, under the circumstances, was sufficient to cure any error. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motions for mistrial in any of these situations. Points of error seven and\n\nnine are overruled.\n\n                           IMPROPER EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE\n\n       In point of error eight, appellant alleges that the trial court, at the punishment stage,\n\nimproperly excluded the testimony of Nicole Barton regarding Scott’s behavior toward his\n\nemployees. Appellant argues that Barton’s testimony was offered to rebut evidence presented by the\n\nState and was relevant to mitigate appellant’s sentence.\n\n       During the punishment phase, the defense called Barton, a former Poly Esther’s employee\n\nwho had worked for Scott. Barton testified that she worked for Scott at the nightclub in 2000 or\n\n2001 when she was 18 or 19 years old, that Scott was a “tyrant,” and that he treated employees as\n\nthough they were expendable. The State objected when the defense attempted to question Barton\n\nregarding why she developed her opinion of Scott. The State objected that Barton’s testimony was\n\f                                                                                          Espada - 21\n\nirrelevant, too remote in time, and prohibited under Texas Rule of Evidence 404.\n\n       Appellant proffered testimony from Barton that he wanted admitted in evidence. Outside the\n\npresence of the jury, Barton stated that Scott made her cry and belittled her. She described one\n\noccasion when she was working but was in extreme pain. She testified that she could not breathe\n\nand needed to vomit but that Scott told her that if she left she would be fired. Barton discovered that\n\nshe had a kidney stone and needed medical treatment. Barton described how Scott berated the\n\nbarbacks, told them that they were expendable, and never told them they did a good job. Barton\n\ntestified that she quit after working at the nightclub for only six months. She described one evening\n\nwhen she returned to the nightclub to pick up a security guard with whom she had a personal\n\nrelationship. According to Barton, Scott told her to stay away from his business, that she had no\n\nright to be there, and that if any security guards were seen with her, they would be fired. The trial\n\ncourt sustained the State’s objection, ruling:\n\n       I’m going to find that her testimony, given the remoteness of when this occurred,\n       years ago; that she doesn’t know the defendant; she’s never met the defendant; she\n       was never a witness to any actions between the defendant and the complainant; is too\n       far removed. That the prejudicial effect of the testimony clearly outweighs the\n       probative value. And I don’t believe it’s relevant at this point.\n\n       A trial court, at the penalty stage of a capital-murder trial, has wide discretion in admitting\n\nor excluding evidence. Ford v.

During the punishment “proceeding, evidence may be\n\npresented by the State and the defendant ... as to any matter that the court deems relevant to\n\nsentence.” Art. 37.071, § 2(a)(1).

Barton quit her employment\n\nlong before appellant began working at Poly Esther’s. Barton did not know appellant and had never\n\nwitnessed any exchanges between Scott and appellant. Because this testimony did not tend to make\n\nthe existence of any fact regarding Scott’s interactions with appellant more or less probable, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding Nicole Barton’s testimony. Point of error eight is\n\noverruled.\n\n                FAILURE TO GIVE ARTICLE 37.071, § 2(f)(3), INSTRUCTION\n\n       In his fourth point of error, appellant complains that the trial court, when instructing the jury\n\nregarding the mitigation special issue, failed to give the instruction contained in Article 37.071, §\n\n2(f)(3). At punishment, the trial court instructed the jury:\n\n       The Second Issue is:\n\n       State whether, taking into consideration all the evidence, including the circumstances\n       of the offense, the defendant’s character and background, and the personal moral\n       culpability of the defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or are\n       sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment\n       rather than a death sentence be imposed.\n\nHowever, jurors were not instructed that they “need not agree on what particular evidence supports\n\nan affirmative finding on the issue” regarding the mitigation special issue. Art. 37.071, § 2(f)(3).\n\n       Appellant argues that the charge robbed him of the safeguard of having jurors made\n\nunambiguously aware that they did not need to agree on the particular evidence that supported a\n\n“yes” answer to the mitigation issue. Appellant further argues that the instruction skewed the jury’s\n\nunderstanding in the prosecution’s favor. As we understand appellant’s argument, he is complaining\n\nthat he was denied the constitutional guarantee of jury unanimity.\n\f                                                                                             Espada - 23\n\n       Appellant did not object to the charge, but now contends that the lack of the instruction\n\negregiously harmed him under the standard set out in Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171. Appellant relies\n\non Mills v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112085\"><a href=\"/opinion/112085/mills-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988), to support his argument that the lack of the Article\n\n37.071, § 2(f)(3), instruction requires reversal. The charge in Mills listed the statutorily available\n\nmitigating circumstances in that case and directed jurors to unanimously affirm whether they agreed\n\nor disagreed that each circumstance did or did not exist. Id. at 378. The United States Supreme\n\nCourt found that such a charge as given may have required that all jurors unanimously agree on the\n\nmitigating circumstances before finding that they warranted a life sentence. Id. at 384. However,\n\neven when presented with the circumstances in Mills, the Supreme Court did not go as far as to say\n\nthat it is a constitutional requirement that every jury deliberating punishment in a capital case should\n\nbe explicitly instructed that they need not agree on the particular mitigating circumstances.\n\n       In this case, while jurors were not given the statutorily required instruction that they need not\n\nagree on the particular mitigating evidence, they unanimously found that no sufficient mitigating\n\ncircumstance or circumstances warranted that a life sentence be imposed. The foreman signed the\n\nanswer that stated: “We, the jury, unanimously find and determine that the answer to this Special\n\nIssue is ‘No.’” Because no juror believed there was a circumstance or circumstances that warranted\n\na life sentence, there was no possibility that the jurors would be confused about a need to agree on\n\na particular circumstance or circumstances.\n\n       Although the trial court erred in failing to give the statutory instruction, in this case appellant\n\nwas not deprived of the constitutional guarantee of a unanimous verdict and did not suffer egregious\n\nharm from the trial court’s failure to include the Article 37.071, § 2(f)(3), instruction. Nor was\n\nappellant denied a fair trial. Point of error four is overruled.\n\f                                                                                         Espada - 24\n\n                INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING VICTIM IMPACT EVIDENCE\n\n       In point of error eleven, appellant alleges that the trial court violated the Eighth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments by failing to provide requested instructions regarding victim-impact\n\nevidence to the jury at punishment.\n\n       Appellant complains first that the jury should have been instructed that its consideration of\n\nvictim-impact evidence should not be conducted in connection with the future dangerousness special\n\nissue. This requested instruction, however, is a misstatement of the law. This Court has said that\n\nvictim-impact evidence is relevant to the future dangerousness special issue if a defendant could\n\nhave reasonably foreseen the impact of the victim’s death on others. See Jackson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1673515\"><a href=\"/opinion/1673515/jackson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 833-34 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n       Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in refusing “to instruct the jury to disregard\n\nvictim impact evidence that was not shown to be within the knowledge or reasonable expectation\n\nof the defendant.” Appellant argues that the trial court should have given such a limiting instruction\n\nbecause he could not have had any specific knowledge regarding the impact of the victims’ deaths\n\non their parents and other loved ones. We reject appellant’s argument. Victim impact evidence is\n\nrelevant to the mitigation special issue regardless of whether, at the time of the murders, the\n\ndefendant was, or reasonably should have been, aware of the impact the victims’ deaths might have\n\non others. See Mosley v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1678386\"><a href=\"/opinion/1678386/mosley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261 n. 16 (Tex.Crim.App. 1998). Therefore, the\n\ntrial court would have erred in giving the requested instruction.\n\n       Appellant additionally complains that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that its\n\nconsideration of victim-impact evidence did not relieve the State of its burden to prove future\n\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. This requested instruction is not required by the law.\n\f                                                                                          Espada - 25\n\nThe jury was instructed that the State was required to prove future dangerousness beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and we presume the jury followed the instructions it was given. Cobarrubio v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1487191\"><a href=\"/opinion/1487191/cobarrubio-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 752 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983). During its argument to the jury at punishment\n\nregarding future dangerousness, the State did not dwell on the victim-impact testimony given by the\n\nvictims’ families. Rather, the State concentrated on the circumstances surrounding the victims’\n\ndeaths and appellant’s actions afterwards. In addition to the facts of the offense, the State presented\n\nevidence that, shortly after being jailed for the instant offense, appellant attacked another inmate.\n\nAppellant was found with drugs and weapons in his jail cell, and, even after the trial process had\n\nbegun, he tore up a disciplinary report and physically assaulted a jail guard.\n\n         Finally, Appellant complains that the trial court refused to instruct the jury not to make a\n\ncomparative worth analysis of the value of the victims to their families and the community compared\n\nto the defendant or other members of society. Appellant complains that the State encouraged the jury\n\nto make such a comparison during closing argument at punishment and should have therefore been\n\ninstructed not to make a comparative worth analysis. Appellant argues that the State asked the jury\n\nto “decide what to do with one life because of the two lives that he took” and to “give Luke and\n\nSandra the same amount of consideration.” Appellant contends that the State asked the jury to\n\ncompare and contrast him with Luke and Sandra when the prosecutor stated: “And when you’re\n\nback there and you’re looking at those photos of the defendant, and you’re comparing and you’re\n\nthinking about the defendant and about Luke and Sandra, ask yourself this: What is one of the major\n\ndifferences between the defendant and Luke and Sandra[?]” Appellant complains that the jury was\n\nimproperly urged to “give them, Sandra and Luke, the consideration that he did not give them in\n\nlife.”\n\f                                                                                       Espada - 26\n\n       Appellant, however, mischaracterizes the State’s arguments to the jury. During closing\n\narguments at punishment, the State argued to the jury:\n\n               Ladies and gentlemen, over the last couple of days you’ve had an opportunity\n       to hear a great deal about the defendant, about his family, about his background,\n       about his upbringing. But right now I’d like to take the opportunity to turn your\n       attention back to why we’re here.\n\n               You’re here right now to decide what to do with one life because of the two\n       lives that he took. So I want you to think about Luke and Sandra during your\n       deliberations. This is certainly the time for you all to remember them.\n\n               And when you go back to the jury room, you’re going to have a stack of\n       photographs that the defense has admitted, photos of the defendant when he was a\n       child, with his family. And you’re going to be able to look at those.\n\n                                              ***\n\n              And when you’re back there and you’re looking at those photos of the\n       defendant, and you’re comparing and you’re thinking about the defendant and about\n       Luke and Sandra, ask yourself this: What is one of the major differences between the\n       defendant and Luke and Sandra during this trial?\n\n              Isn’t the major difference that he has had an opportunity to explain to you\n       why his life should be spared? Did Luke have that opportunity? No. The defendant\n       decided that Luke Scott needed to die.\n\n                                              ***\n\n                What about Sandra? Actually, we know Sandra did have an opportunity. She\n       had an opportunity to explain why he should spare her life. He gave her 30 minutes\n       to talk to him. ... Her pleas for her life fell on his deaf ears.\n\n                But now he has the opportunity – his family has the opportunity to plead for\n       his life.\n\n               So I’m going to ask you that while you’re back there and you’re deliberating,\n       that you give them, Sandra and Luke, the consideration that he did not give them in\n       life.\n\n       The State did not ask the jury to make a comparative worth analysis of the value of the\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 27\n\nvictims to their families and the community compared to appellant or other members of society.\n\nRather, the State personalized the victims just as the defense personalized appellant. On this record,\n\nand in the absence of a statutory requirement directing that the jury be instructed as appellant argues\n\nregarding victim-impact evidence, the trial court committed no error in not giving these instructions\n\nto the jury. Point of error eleven is overruled.\n\n                                           DEFINITIONS\n\n       In points of error twelve, thirteen, and fifteen, appellant complains that the trial court failed\n\nto define “probability,” “criminal acts of violence,” and “continuing threat to society” for the jury\n\nduring the punishment phase. In point of error fourteen, appellant argues that the trial court erred\n\nin failing to define the word “militates” so as to preclude consideration of the defendant’s age, race,\n\nsex, national origin, religion, political views, or sexual orientation as a factor supporting a death\n\nsentence. This Court has previously stated that words and phrases that are not statutorily defined\n\nare to be given their usual meanings and no specific instructions are required for those words or\n\nphrases.

Appellant appears to argue that, because the trial court did not\n\ngive this instruction, the jury could have sentenced him based on his religious and insular\n\nupbringing, thus removing the jury’s focus from his culpability and denying him an individualized\n\nconsideration prior to imposing a death sentence. There are no constitutional or legislative\n\nrequirements for an instruction that limits the scope of militating evidence to that which the jury\n\nmight consider as increasing a defendant’s moral culpability. Further, the State’s arguments to the\n\njury regarding both the future dangerousness and mitigation special issues focused on appellant’s\n\nactions and appellant’s blameworthiness. There were no arguments presented that encouraged the\n\njury to consider any evidence other than that which indicated increased moral culpability on the part\n\nof appellant. Point of error sixteen is overruled.\n\n        In point of error seventeen, appellant complains that the trial court failed to instruct jurors\n\nthat the finding of guilt in the first phase of trial did not foreclose consideration of evidence that they\n\nbelieved tended to reduce appellant’s moral blameworthiness. At punishment, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury that it was to “consider all the evidence in this case” and that it was to “consider\n\nall evidence admitted at the guilt or innocence and the punishment stage, including evidence of the\n\f                                                                                            Espada - 29\n\ndefendant’s background or character or the circumstances of the offense that militates for or\n\nmitigates against the imposition of the death penalty.” While the trial court’s instruction to the jury\n\ndid not track appellant’s requested language, the instruction given accomplished the same goal. The\n\ntrial court did not commit error. Point of error seventeen is overruled.\n\n        In point of error eighteen, appellant alleges that the trial court violated the Eighth\n\nAmendment by failing to instruct the jury that there is no presumption in favor of death. Appellant\n\nargues that the jury should have been instructed that even if they found appellant a future danger in\n\nresponse to the first special issue, the mitigation special issue was to be considered independently\n\nwithout regard to the jury’s finding regarding the first special issue.\n\n        Article 37.071 provides that a jury may not consider the mitigation special issue until it\n\naffirmatively answers the future dangerousness special issue. Further, once the jury reached the\n\nmitigation special issue, it was entitled to, and even required, to consider all of the evidence. Article\n\n37.071 does not require a specific instruction spelling this out to the jury. Nor does anything in this\n\nrecord or the Constitution demand that such an instruction be provided. Appellant’s requested\n\ninstruction would have been a misstatement of the law. Point of error eighteen is overruled.\n\n        In point of error nineteen, appellant complains that the trial court unconstitutionally failed\n\nto instruct the jury “so as to provide a vehicle for a juror to return a life verdict where the juror\n\nconcludes that the aggravating factors, although established by the evidence, still are not so severe\n\nas to call for death as a punishment.” Appellant cites to Smith v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137727\"><a href=\"/opinion/137727/smith-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004), to\n\nsupport his argument that the charge “does not allow for a life sentence in the case where\n\ncircumstances exist that may lessen the applicability of the death penalty despite the existence of a\n\nfinding that the defendant will commit future acts of violence.” Appellant appears to be arguing that\n\f                                                                                             Espada - 30\n\nhe was not given a sufficient vehicle by which the jury could consider his mitigating evidence.\n\n        The Supreme Court’s decision in Smith addressed the constitutionality of a non-statutory,\n\n“nullification” special issue that effectively instructed the jury to change one of its “yes” answers to\n\none of the statutory special issues to a “no” answer if the jury believed that mitigating circumstances\n\nexisted warranting a sentence less than death. See Smith, 543 U.S. at 38-39, 45-49. The statutory\n\nmitigation special issue submitted in this case is nothing like the “nullification” instruction at issue\n\nin Smith. The statutory mitigation special issue in this case provided appellant’s jury with a vehicle\n\nto fully consider and give effect to appellant’s mitigating evidence without requiring the jury to\n\ndisregard its oath and instructions by changing its answer to the other special issue. Unlike the jury\n\nin Smith, the jury in this case could have fully considered and given effect to appellant’s mitigating\n\nevidence by providing a “yes” answer to the mitigation special issue thus resulting in a life sentence.\n\nPoint of error nineteen is overruled.\n\n        In points of error twenty-two and twenty-four, appellant alleges that the trial court’s\n\ninstructions at punishment unconstitutionally “failed to provide the jury the opportunity to have its\n\ndecision reflect a ‘reasoned moral response’” to appellant and his offense and failed to provide a\n\nsatisfactory process for considering and giving effect to mitigating circumstances. Appellant\n\nspecifically argues that the jury instructions suggest that if mitigating circumstances are not sufficient\n\nin relation to future dangerousness, a death sentence is warranted.\n\n        Under the Texas capital-sentencing scheme, when mitigating evidence is presented, jurors\n\nindividually determine what evidence, if any, mitigates against the imposition of the death penalty\n\nand what weight, if any, to give that evidence in their consideration.

Article 37.071, § 2(e), provides that the jury “shall” answer the\n\f                                                                                           Espada - 31\n\nmitigation issue, which directs “considerations of all evidence, including circumstances of the\n\noffense, the defendant’s character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the\n\ndefendant.” This Court has previously determined that Article 37.071 is constitutional because it\n\nrequires the jury to consider all of the evidence and determine whether such mitigating circumstances\n\nexist as to warrant a life sentence. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 671; see also Saldano v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1685878\"><a href=\"/opinion/1685878/saldano-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100-01 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Points of error twenty-two and twenty-four are\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error twenty-five, appellant alleges the trial court unconstitutionally failed to\n\nprovide verdict forms that gave priority to the mitigation special issue and made it independent of\n\nthe future dangerousness special issue. Appellant requested that the jury be provided verdict forms\n\nthat placed the mitigation special issue before the future dangerousness special issue and that the jury\n\nbe directed to answer the mitigation special issue before proceeding to the question of future\n\ndangerousness.\n\n       The order of the presentation of the special issues is dictated by Article 37.071, which\n\nprovides that, upon conclusion of the presentation of evidence during punishment, the trial court\n\nshall submit the special issues to the jury. The jury is instructed that if it answers the future\n\ndangerousness issue affirmatively, only then must it answer the mitigation special issue. Art. 37.071,\n\n§ 2(e). We have previously upheld the constitutionality of Article 37.071. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d\n\nat 671. Appellant does not convince us to the contrary. Point of error twenty-five is overruled.\n\n       In the twenty-sixth point of error, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in refusing to\n\ninstruct the jury that the State’s burden of persuasion to obtain a death verdict is “beyond all doubt”\n\nrather than “beyond reasonable doubt.” Appellant acknowledges that the Texas law requires the\n\f                                                                                              Espada - 32\n\n“beyond reasonable doubt” standard rather the “beyond all doubt” standard. In fact, Appellant\n\nconcedes that no state has adopted the “beyond all doubt” standard. There is no constitutional\n\nrequirement that the State be held to a “beyond all doubt” standard. See In re Winship, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n364 (1970) (stating that the “Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt.”). Point of error twenty-six is overruled.\n\n                                          THE “10-12” RULE\n\n        In his tenth point of error, appellant alleges that the trial court violated the Sixth, Eighth, and\n\nFourteenth Amendments. He argues that the trial court failed to instruct jurors that a vote by one of\n\nthem would result in a life sentence despite the statutory requirements of ten votes for a “no”\n\nresponse to the question of future dangerousness, or for a “yes” response to a finding of a mitigating\n\ncircumstance. This Court has consistently upheld the “10-12” rule as constitutional. Prystash v.\n\nState, 3 S.W.3d 522,536 (1999); McFarland v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2413967\"><a href=\"/opinion/2413967/mcfarland-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519 (1996); Lawton v.

Appellant has given us no reason to revisit this issue. Point of\n\nerror ten is overruled.\n\n                            PRECLUSION OF THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n        In point of error twenty, appellant complains that the trial court erred when it refused to\n\npreclude the death penalty as a sentencing option or to quash the indictment because the grand jury\n\ndid not allege facts legally essential to the conviction and death sentence. Appellant contends that\n\nunder Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), and Ring v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121165\"><a href=\"/opinion/121165/ring-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), he\n\nhas the constitutional right to have the grand jury allege in the indictment all the specific facts legally\n\nessential to his death sentence, including facts supporting a negative response to the mitigation\n\nspecial issue. This Court has previously addressed this complaint and determined that neither\n\f                                                                                             Espada - 33\n\nApprendi nor Ring require the State to allege the special issues in the indictment.

State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560975\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560975/russeau-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 885-86 (Tex.

Crim.\n\nApp. 2003). Point of error twenty is overruled.\n\n       In his twenty-first point of error, appellant alleges the trial court violated the Equal Protection\n\nClause by failing to preclude the death penalty as a sentencing option. Appellant complains that\n\nthere are no statewide standards to guide Texas prosecutors in deciding when they should seek the\n\ndeath penalty. This Court has previously considered and rejected this argument; appellant has given\n\nus no reason to reconsider our decision. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 671-72. Point of error twenty-\n\none is overruled.\n\n                                      CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n       In his twenty-eighth point of error, appellant urges this Court to consider the cumulative\n\nimpact of the errors presented above. While a number of errors may be found harmful in its\n\ncumulative effect, Chamberlain v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1501169\"><a href=\"/opinion/1501169/chamberlain-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238 (Tex.
