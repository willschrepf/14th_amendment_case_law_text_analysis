See Request Letter at 1-3. We limit our analysis accordingly. See Tex. Att'y Gen. Op.\nNos. GA-0670 (2008) at 2 n.2, JC-0521 (2002) at 2, DM-42 (1991) at 1 (limiting analysis to issues\ndiscussed in the opinion request letter).\n\nI.      Background\n\n        The Request Letter notes that the Texas State Teachers Association (\"TSTA\") provides its\nmembers and prospective members a form on which they may authorize their school district\nemployers to make automatic, monthly deductions from their paychecks for payment to the TSTA\nPolitical Action Committee (\"TSTA-PAC\") and the National Education Association Fund for\nChildren and Public Education (''NEA-Fund''), which is also a political action committee. 2 See\nRequest Letter at 2 (citing Texas State Teachers AssociationlNational Education Agency Enrollment\nForm3 and TSTA-PAC Direct Debit Authorization Form4). Completed forms are forwarded to\nschool districts, which process the authorizations and deduct the political contributions to TSTA-\nPAC and NEA-Fund from employees' paychecks. Request Letter at 2. According to the Request\n\n\n\n\n        'See Request Letter from Honorable Leo Berman, Former Chair, Committee on Elections, Texas House of\nRepresentatives at 1 (Mar. 18,2008), available at http://www.texasattomeygeneral.gov.\n\n        2The Request Letter uses the acronym \"NEA-PAC\"; the acronym \"NEA-Fund\" is indicated on the enrollment\nform and is used on the National Education Association (\"NEA\") website.\n\n        3Available   at http://www.tsta.org/includes/imagesiFallform.pdf (last visited May 11, 2010).\n\n        4Available at http://www.tsta.org/legislative/update/pACnew.pdf (last visited May 11, 2010).\n\fThe Honorable Rob Eissler - Page 2                   (GA-0774)\n\n\n\nLetter, school district resources are used to set up the deductions and facilitate the transfer of funds\nto TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund. Id.\n\nII.      Legal Analysis\n\n        School districts may process payroll deductions only if their authority to do so is expressly\ngranted by the constitution or statutes or necessarily implied therefrom. See Geffert v. Yorktown\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 290 S.W. 1083, 1084 (Tex. Comm'n App. 1927) (explaining that independent\nschool districts have only those powers specifically given or implied as a necessary incident to those\nexpressly conferred and that their powers must be exercised in strict conformity with the mandatory\ndirection of the Legislature); Fowler v. Tyler Indep. Sch. Dist., 232 S.W.3d 335, 338-39 (Tex.\nApp.-Tyler 2007, pet. denied) (noting that a public school district exercises only those powers that\nthe state delegates to it); Tex. Att'y Gen. Op. No. GA-0596 (2008) at 2 n.2 (same).\n\n         A.    Express Statutory Authority\n\n        We have not found, and no briefing to this office has identified, any statute specifically\nauthorizing a school district to provide payroll deductions for political contributions to political\ncommittees. s The Request Letter discusses section 22.001 of the Education Code, which provides,\n\"A school district employee is entitled to have an amount deducted from the employee's salary for\nmembership fees or dues to a professional organization.\" TEx. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 22.001(a)\n(Vernon 2006). We review section 22.00 1 to determine whether it authorizes payroll deductions for\npolitical contributions to political committees. School districts would have express statutory\nauthority to utilize governmental resources to process such deductions for contributions to TSTA-\nPAC and NEA-Fund under section 22.001 if TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund were \"professional\norganizations\" and the deductions were \"membership fees or dues.\"\n\n         No statute, rule, or appellate court opinion defines the term \"professional organization\" as\nused in section 22.001(a). Nor were we provided any information, briefing, or analysis attempting\nto define the term. When statutory terms are undefined, they are to be construed according to their\ncommon meaning. TEx. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 3l:l.011(a) (Vernon 2005). Texas courts rely on\ndictionaries to determine the meaning of terms not defined in statute. See Ctr. Point Energy Entex\nv. R.R. Comm 'n, 208 S. W.3d 608,619 (Tex. App.-Austin 2006, pet. dism' d) (explaining that Texas\ncourts may rely on commonly-used dictionaries to discern the plain meaning of statutory terms)\n(citing Powell v. Stover, 165 S.W.3d 322, 326 (Tex. 2005»; Tex. Att'yGen. Op.

See TEX.\nELEC. CODE ANN. § 25 1.00 1(14)(A)-{B) (Vernon 2010) (defming a general purpose political committee). See also\nTEXAS Enncs COMMISSION, ACTIVE POW'ICAL COMMITTEES (PACs) AND THEIR TREASURERS (listing TSTA-PAC as\na general purpose committee), available at http://www.ethics.state.tx.us/teddlpaclistc.htm(lastvisitedMay 11,2010).\nNEA-Fund is a political committee established under federal law and regulated by the Federal Election Commission\n(\"FEC\"). See FEC FORM 1, STATEMENT OF ORGANIZATION, NEA FUND FOR ClllLDREN AND EDUCATION at 2 (reporting\nthat NEA-Fund is a political action committee that is a separate segregated fund under federal law), available at\nhttp://images.nictusa.com/pdfl736/29991868736/29991868736.pdf#navpanes=O (last visited May 11, 2010).\n\fThe Honorable Rob Eissler - Page 3                      (GA-0774)\n\n\n\nCode). A commonly-used dictionary defines a \"professional association\" as \"[a] group of\nprofessionals organized for education, social activity, or lobbying, such as a bar association.\"\nBLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 141 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added). The noun \"organization\" means:\n\"A body of persons (such as a union or corporation) formed for a common purpose. - Also termed\nsociety.\" Id. at 1210. The adjective \"professional\" means \"of, relating to, or characteristic of a\nprofession.\" MERRIAM-WEBSTER' S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 991 (11 th ed. 2004); see also id.\n(defining the noun \"profession\" as \"a calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and\nintensive academic preparation\"). These definitions suggest that the term \"professional\norganization\" could be defined as a group of professionals organized for a common purpose relating\nto their profession. 6\n\n        In order to determine whether TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund are groups of professionals\norganized for a common purpose relating to their profession for purposes of Education Code section\n22.001, we contrast the functions of TSTA and NEA from those of TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund.\nTSTA-PAC is a general purpose political committee under chapter 251 of Texas Election Code.\nSee supra note 5. Section 251.001 describes a \"general-purpose committee\" as a \"political\ncommittee that has among its principal purposes: supporting or opposing: two or more candidates\nwho are unidentified or are seeking offices that are unknown; or one or more measures that are\nunidentified; or assisting two or more officeholders who are unidentified.\" TEx. ELEC. CODE ANN.\n§ 251.001(14)(A)-{B) (Vernon 2010) (internal notations omitted). NEA-Fund is a political\ncommittee and separate segregated fund (\"SSF\") regulated by the FEC. See supra note 5. NEA-\nFund collects contributions to make contributions, expenditures, and political communications to\ninfluence federal elections. See FEC, SEPARATE SEGREGATED FUNDS AND NON-CONNECTED PACs. 7\nThus, political committees perform a somewhat narrow range of state and federally-regulated\npolitical-functions. 8\n\n      NEA is a federally-chartered corporation formed to advance the profession of teaching and\npromote the cause of education in America. 36 V.S.C.A. §§ 151101, 151102 (2001). TSTA is a\n\n\n\n\n           6The meaning of the term \"professional organization\" as it is used throughout the Education Code is consistent\nwith that defmition. See, e.g., TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. §§ 61.090(c)(2) (Vernon 2006) (providing that \"professional\norganizations\" disseminate \"assessment and care protocols\" as well as \"informational materials regarding the\nprofessional, organizational, and managerial capacities necessary to advance the quality of care in long-term care\nfacilities\"), 132.002(a)(5) (Vernon Supp. 2009) (indicating that \"professional organizations\" sponsor courses for their\nmembers), 100 1.002(c)(4) (Vernon Supp. 2009) (providing that \"professional organizations\" sponsor driving education\ncourses to instruct their members). See also TEX. GOy'T CODE ANN. § 311.011 (a) (Vernon 2005) (providing that words\nand phrases shall be read in context); Monsanto v. Cornerstones Mun. Util. Dist., 865 S.W.2d 937,940 (Tex. 1993)\n(interpreting a statutory term by analyzing its use in other statutes).\n         7Available at http://www.fec.gov/pageslbrochures/ssfvnonconnected.pdf (last visited May      11, 2010).\n          8See, e.g., TSTAlNEA2009-1 0ENROLLMENT FORM (stating that TSTA-PAC andNEA-Fund\"co llectvoluntary\ncontributions from Association members and use these contributions for political purposes, including, but not limited\nto, making contributions to and expenditures on behalf of friends of public education who are candidates for federal\noffice\"), available at http://www.tsta.orgiincludes/imagesiFallform.pdf(last visited May 11, 2010).\n\fThe Honorable Rob Eissler - Page 4                     (GA.,0774)\n\n\n\nnon-profit corporation organized for educational and scientific purposes. 9 TSTA performs many\nfunctions associated with professional organizations, such as offering its members teaching\nworkshops, online classes through the NEA Academy, and summer leadership-academies. See\nAbout TSTAlNEA. IO TSTA also offers Educational Support Professional Conferences and\nprofessional awards programs. See TSTA LOCAL ASSOCIA nONS. I I In addition to its educational\nprograms, TSTA offers its members access to discounted products and services, the ability to\npurchase health-care coverage, legal liability coverage, and access to NEA programs. See ABOUT\nTSTAlNEA, supra note 11. In summary, TSTA and NEA appear to be groups of professionals\norganized for a purpose relating to their profession, while TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund appear merely\nto collect contributions and make contributions, expenditures, and political communications to\ninfluence elections.\n\n        In order for a school district to have authority to process the payroll deductions for\ncontributions to TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund, not only would those political committees have to be\n\"professional organizations\" for purposes of section 22.001, but school district employees'\ncontributions to them would also have to be membership fees or dues. See TEx. EDUC. CODE ANN.\n§ 22.001(a) (Vernon 2006) (providing a school district employee is entitled to have an amount\ndeducted from the employee's salary for membership fees or dues to professional organizations).\nThe Education Code does not define the terms \"membership fees\" and \"dues\" and we received no\nbriefing that attempted to define them. However, the terms \"membership fees\" or \"dues\" commonly\ndenote a fixed amount of money due or owed in exchange for membership status. See MERRIAM-\nWEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 740 (9th ed. 1990) (defining the noun \"membership\" as \"the\nstate or status of being a member\"), id. at 454 (defining the noun \"fee\" as a \"fixed charge\"), id at\n387 (defining the noun \"due\" as \"something due or owed ... a payment or obligation required by\nlaw or custom\").\n\n        In contrast to the fixed amount of money due or owed in exchange for membership in a\nprofessional organization, political contributions do not confer membership status on the contributor.\nSee TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. § 251.001(3) (Vernon 2010) (defining a \"campaign contribution\" as a\ncontribution to a \"political committee offered or given with the intent that it be used in connection\nwith a campaign for elective office or on a measure\") (emphasis added). See also 11 C.F.R. § 114.5\n(2010) (requiring that contributions to SSFs be voluntary). Accordingly, the FEC contrasts\n\n\n         9See TEX. Bus. ORG.

See FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION CAMPAIGN GUIDE, CORPORATIONS AND LABOR\nORGANIZATIONS at 19 (Jan. 2007)12 (noting that an \"SSF may not use dues or fees obtained as a\ncondition of membership or employment in the connected organization, even if the dues or fees are\nrefundable upon request\").\n\n        We note that briefs received by our office arguing that school districts have authority to\nprocess the payroll deductions for contributions to political committees do not claim that such\ndeductions constitute membership fees or dues. Instead, like state and federal law, the briefs\nconsistently distinguish political-committee contributions from membership fees and dues. See Brief\nof Texas State Teachers AssociationlNational Education Association at 3 (Apr. 21, 2008) (noting\nthat \"TSTA has the responsibility of separating dues and PAC deductions in accordance with state\nand federal election laws. Thus, school districts do not expend any other effort or resources to\nprocess a PAC contribution than what they are already required to do by law for a dues deduction.\")\n[hereinafter TSTA Brief]; Brief of Texas Classroom Teachers Association at 10 n.3 (May 5, 2008)\n(distinguishing \"contributions to the political action committee affiliated with the Texas Classroom\nTeachers Association\" from \"association dues that members can have withheld from their paychecks\npursuant to Section 22.001, Texas Education Code\"); Brief of Texas American Federation of\nTeachers at 2 (May 5, 2008) (\"No Texas statute prohibits an independent school district from\nincluding an authorized contribution to a'political action committee when it makes the authorized\ndeduction for membership dues.\").\n\n        Accordingly, a court would likely conclude that contributions to political committees such\nas TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund are not membership fees or dues to professional organizations. As\na result, a school district would not have express authority to process payroll deductions for\ncontributions to TSTA-PAC or NEA-Fund under section 22.001 of the Education Code.\n\n       B.    Implied Authority\n\n         Having concluded that school districts do not have express authority to process payroll\ndeductions for political contributions, we turn to the question of their implied authority. School\ndistricts have implied authority to perform acts that are reasonably necessary to carry out their\nexpressly-granted duties. Geffert, 290 S.W. at 1084. A court would determine whether a statute\nimpliedly authorizes a school district's act by determining whether the act would be necessary in\norder for the district to use its statutorily-prescribed powers. See Thompson v. Elmo Indep. Sch.\nDist., 269 S.W. 868,870 (Tex. Civ. App.-Waco 1925, no writ) (noting that a school district has\nimplied powers that are indispensable, rather than merely convenient, to its declared objects and\npurposes) (citing Foster v. City o/Waco, 255 s..W: 1104, 1105-06 (Tex. 1923)).\n\n       In determining whether school districts' express authority to process payroll deductions for\nmembership fees or dues to professional organizations necessarily implies authority to process\ncontributions to political committees, we first note that TSTA appears to conclude that districts may\n\n\n       12Available at http://wWw.fec.gov/pdflcolagui.pdf(lastvisitedMay 11, 2010).\n\fThe Honorable Rob Eissler - Page 6                   (GA-0774)\n\n\n\nprocess membership dues without processing contributions to political committees. 13 Furthermore,\nschool districts may process expressly-authorized deductions for their employees' health-plan\nexpenses and child-care expenses without any apparent need to also process deductions for\ncontributions to political committees. See TEx. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 22.005 (Vernon 2006), TEx.\nINs. CODE ANN. art. 3.51 (Vernon 2009) (authorizing school districts to deduct health-care expenses\nfrom their employees' paychecks); see also TEx. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 610.021 (Vernon 2004)\n(authorizing school districts to enter into agreements with their employees to reduce their employees'\nperiodic compensation by an amount to be paid ~or child-care expenses). Compare TEx. EDUC.\nCODE ANN. § 22.002(b) (Vernon 2006) (requiring, upon satisfaction of certain requirements, a\nschool district to honor its employees' assignment, pledge, or transfer of salary or wages as security\nfor indebtedness). Thus, the Legislature's decision to grant school districts express power to process\npayroll deductions for specific purposes indicates that it did not necessarily grant school districts the\npower to process payroll deductions for non-specified purposes. See Old Am. County Mut. Insur.\nFire Co. v. Sanchez, 149 S. W.3d 111, 115 (Tex. 2004) (presuming that every word of a statute is\nincluded or excluded for a reason); see also Brookshire v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 508 S. W.2d\n675,679 (Tex. Civ. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1974, no writ) (finding that a law did not apply to\na school district beyond the specified terms of the law because ''the 'inclusion of the specific\nlimitation excludes all others \"') (citing Harris County v. Crooker, 248 S. W. 652, 655 (Tex. 1923)).\n\n        Indeed, if school districts' express authority to process payroll deductions for membership\nfees or dues to professional organizations granted districts implicit authority to process deductions\nfor other purposes, the Legislature would not have granted districts express authority to process\ndeductions for other purposes, including health-care and child-care expenses. See City ofRockwall\nv. Hughes, 246 S. W.3d 621,636 (Tex. 2008) (explaining that the Legislature is presumed not to have\ndone a useless act). SeealsoAckerv. Tex. WaterComm'n, 790 S.W.2d299, 301 (Tex. 1990)(noting\nthatthe Legislature is presumed to have enacted a statute with complete knowledge of the existing\nlaw and with reference to it). Accordingly, a court would likely find that school districts do not have\nimplied statutory-authority to process payroll deductions for political committee contributions.\n\n        The conclusion that the Legislature did not impliedly grant districts authority to process\npayroll deductions for contributions to political committees is consistent with the Legislature's\ngeneral aversion to the use of public funds for political purposes. See, e.g., TEx. EDUC. CODE ANN.\n§ 11.169 (Vernon Supp. 2009) (\"Notwithstanding any other law, the board of trustees of an\nindependent school district may not use state or local funds or other resources of the district to\nelectioneer for or against any candidate, measure, or political party.\"); TEx. GOV'T CODE ANN. §\n556.004(a) (Vernon 2004) (noting that \"[a] state agency may not use any money under its control,\nincluding appropriated money, to finance or otherwise support the candidacy of a person for an office\nin the legislative, executive, or judicial branch of state government or of the government of the\nUnited States\").\n\n\n         \\3See TSTAlNEA2009-10 ENROLLMENT FORM (allowing TSTA members to authorize payroll deductions for\nTSTAINEA membership dues while declining to authorize payroll deductions for TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund\ncontributions), available athttp://www.tsta.org/includes/images/Fallform.pdf(lastvisitedMay 11,2010); see also TSTA\nBrief at 3 (noting that the amount deducted under section 22.001 of the Education Code would include a PAC\ncontribution only if the employee chooses to make a PAC contribution).\n\fThe Honorable Rob Eissler - Page 7                     (GA-,0774)\n\n\n\n\n         C.     First Amendment Freedom of Speech\n\n         We received several briefs that questioned whether prohibiting payroll deductions for\npolitical contributions would be unconstitutional. See, e.g., TSTA Brief at 4-7. The United States\nSupreme Court recently considered this question. It ruled that a state's \"ban on political payroll\ndeductions\" is \"justified by the State's interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government\nfavoritism or entanglement with partisan politics.\" Ysursa v. Pocatello Educ. Ass 'n., 129 S. Ct.\n1093, 1098 (2009). In the Ysursa case, the question before the Court was \"whether the State must\naffirmatively assist political speech by allowing public employers to administer payroll deductions\nfor political activities. For the reasons set forth in [the] opinion, the answer is no.\" Id. at 1101. The\nSupreme Court found that the state's ban on political payroll deductions did not infringe the exercise\nof First Amendment rights. Id. at 1098. Consequently, the Legislature's decision not to authorize\nschool districts to process deductions for contributions to political committees would likely\nwithstand a constitutional challenge. 14\n\n         D.     Penal Code Section 39.02\n\n        Finally, it is argued that the \"use of public resources to collect and distribute political\ndonations would appear to be a criminal misapplication of state resources which violates Penal Code\n[section] 39.02.\" Request Letter at 2-3. In order to commit an offense under section 39.02 of the\nPenal Code, a public servant would have to \"with intent to obtain a benefit or with intent to harm\nor defraud another ... intentionally or knowingly ... misuse[] government property, services,\npersonnel, or any other thing of value. \" TEx.

However, the Legislature\n             has not expressly authorized school districts to process payroll\n             deductions for contributions to political committees such as TSTA-\n             PAC and NEA-Fund.\n\n                      The Legislature impliedly authorizes school districts to\n             undertake those activities that school districts would need to do in\n             order to exercise the authority that the Legislature expressly granted\n             them. However, the Legislature has not impliedly authorized school\n             districts to process payroll deductions for contributions to political\n             committees such as TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund because doing so\n             would not be necessary to perform school districts' expressly\n             authorized functions.\n\n                    Because the Legislature has not expressly or impliedly\n             authorized school districts to process payroll deductions for\n             contributions to political committees such as TSTA-PAC and NEA-\n             Fund, Texas law prohibits school' districts from processing such\n             contributions.\n\n                    The Legislature's decision notto authorize school districts to\n             process payroll deductions for contributions to political committees\n             would likely withstand a constitutional challenge.\n\n                     Proof of a public servant's culpable mental state is a fact\n             question that cannot be resolved in the opinion process.

Completed forms are forwarded to\nschool districts, which process the authorizations and deduct the political contributions to TSTA-\nPAC and NEA-Fund from employees' paychecks. Request Letter at 2.

Express Statutory Authority\n\n        We have not found, and no briefing to this office has identified, any statute specifically\nauthorizing a school district to provide payroll deductions for political contributions to political\ncommittees. s The Request Letter discusses section 22.001 of the Education Code, which provides,\n\"A school district employee is entitled to have an amount deducted from the employee's salary for\nmembership fees or dues to a professional organization.\" TEx. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 22.001(a)\n(Vernon 2006). We review section 22.00 1 to determine whether it authorizes payroll deductions for\npolitical contributions to political committees. School districts would have express statutory\nauthority to utilize governmental resources to process such deductions for contributions to TSTA-\nPAC and NEA-Fund under section 22.001 if TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund were \"professional\norganizations\" and the deductions were \"membership fees or dues.\"\n\n         No statute, rule, or appellate court opinion defines the term \"professional organization\" as\nused in section 22.001(a). Nor were we provided any information, briefing, or analysis attempting\nto define the term. When statutory terms are undefined, they are to be construed according to their\ncommon meaning. TEx. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 3l:l.011(a) (Vernon 2005). Texas courts rely on\ndictionaries to determine the meaning of terms not defined in statute. See Ctr. Point Energy Entex\nv. R.R. Comm 'n, 208 S.

A commonly-used dictionary defines a \"professional association\" as \"[a] group of\nprofessionals organized for education, social activity, or lobbying, such as a bar association.\"\nBLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 141 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added). The noun \"organization\" means:\n\"A body of persons (such as a union or corporation) formed for a common purpose. - Also termed\nsociety.\" Id. at 1210. The adjective \"professional\" means \"of, relating to, or characteristic of a\nprofession.\" MERRIAM-WEBSTER' S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 991 (11 th ed. 2004); see also id.\n(defining the noun \"profession\" as \"a calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and\nintensive academic preparation\"). These definitions suggest that the term \"professional\norganization\" could be defined as a group of professionals organized for a common purpose relating\nto their profession. 6\n\n        In order to determine whether TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund are groups of professionals\norganized for a common purpose relating to their profession for purposes of Education Code section\n22.001, we contrast the functions of TSTA and NEA from those of TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund.\nTSTA-PAC is a general purpose political committee under chapter 251 of Texas Election Code.\nSee supra note 5. Section 251.001 describes a \"general-purpose committee\" as a \"political\ncommittee that has among its principal purposes: supporting or opposing: two or more candidates\nwho are unidentified or are seeking offices that are unknown; or one or more measures that are\nunidentified; or assisting two or more officeholders who are unidentified.\" TEx. ELEC. CODE ANN.\n§ 251.001(14)(A)-{B) (Vernon 2010) (internal notations omitted). NEA-Fund is a political\ncommittee and separate segregated fund (\"SSF\") regulated by the FEC. See supra note 5. NEA-\nFund collects contributions to make contributions, expenditures, and political communications to\ninfluence federal elections. See FEC, SEPARATE SEGREGATED FUNDS AND NON-CONNECTED PACs. 7\nThus, political committees perform a somewhat narrow range of state and federally-regulated\npolitical-functions. 8\n\n      NEA is a federally-chartered corporation formed to advance the profession of teaching and\npromote the cause of education in America. 36 V.S.C.A. §§ 151101, 151102 (2001). TSTA is a\n\n\n\n\n           6The meaning of the term \"professional organization\" as it is used throughout the Education Code is consistent\nwith that defmition. See, e.g., TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. §§ 61.090(c)(2) (Vernon 2006) (providing that \"professional\norganizations\" disseminate \"assessment and care protocols\" as well as \"informational materials regarding the\nprofessional, organizational, and managerial capacities necessary to advance the quality of care in long-term care\nfacilities\"), 132.002(a)(5) (Vernon Supp. 2009) (indicating that \"professional organizations\" sponsor courses for their\nmembers), 100 1.002(c)(4) (Vernon Supp. 2009) (providing that \"professional organizations\" sponsor driving education\ncourses to instruct their members).

See\nAbout TSTAlNEA. IO TSTA also offers Educational Support Professional Conferences and\nprofessional awards programs. See TSTA LOCAL ASSOCIA nONS. I I In addition to its educational\nprograms, TSTA offers its members access to discounted products and services, the ability to\npurchase health-care coverage, legal liability coverage, and access to NEA programs. See ABOUT\nTSTAlNEA, supra note 11. In summary, TSTA and NEA appear to be groups of professionals\norganized for a purpose relating to their profession, while TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund appear merely\nto collect contributions and make contributions, expenditures, and political communications to\ninfluence elections.\n\n        In order for a school district to have authority to process the payroll deductions for\ncontributions to TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund, not only would those political committees have to be\n\"professional organizations\" for purposes of section 22.001, but school district employees'\ncontributions to them would also have to be membership fees or dues. See TEx. EDUC. CODE ANN.\n§ 22.001(a) (Vernon 2006) (providing a school district employee is entitled to have an amount\ndeducted from the employee's salary for membership fees or dues to professional organizations).\nThe Education Code does not define the terms \"membership fees\" and \"dues\" and we received no\nbriefing that attempted to define them. However, the terms \"membership fees\" or \"dues\" commonly\ndenote a fixed amount of money due or owed in exchange for membership status. See MERRIAM-\nWEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 740 (9th ed. 1990) (defining the noun \"membership\" as \"the\nstate or status of being a member\"), id. at 454 (defining the noun \"fee\" as a \"fixed charge\"), id at\n387 (defining the noun \"due\" as \"something due or owed ... a payment or obligation required by\nlaw or custom\").\n\n        In contrast to the fixed amount of money due or owed in exchange for membership in a\nprofessional organization, political contributions do not confer membership status on the contributor.\nSee TEX. ELEC. CODE ANN. § 251.001(3) (Vernon 2010) (defining a \"campaign contribution\" as a\ncontribution to a \"political committee offered or given with the intent that it be used in connection\nwith a campaign for elective office or on a measure\") (emphasis added). See also 11 C.F.R. § 114.5\n(2010) (requiring that contributions to SSFs be voluntary). Accordingly, the FEC contrasts\n\n\n         9See TEX. Bus. ORG.

See FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION CAMPAIGN GUIDE, CORPORATIONS AND LABOR\nORGANIZATIONS at 19 (Jan. 2007)12 (noting that an \"SSF may not use dues or fees obtained as a\ncondition of membership or employment in the connected organization, even if the dues or fees are\nrefundable upon request\").\n\n        We note that briefs received by our office arguing that school districts have authority to\nprocess the payroll deductions for contributions to political committees do not claim that such\ndeductions constitute membership fees or dues. Instead, like state and federal law, the briefs\nconsistently distinguish political-committee contributions from membership fees and dues. See Brief\nof Texas State Teachers AssociationlNational Education Association at 3 (Apr. 21, 2008) (noting\nthat \"TSTA has the responsibility of separating dues and PAC deductions in accordance with state\nand federal election laws. Thus, school districts do not expend any other effort or resources to\nprocess a PAC contribution than what they are already required to do by law for a dues deduction.\")\n[hereinafter TSTA Brief]; Brief of Texas Classroom Teachers Association at 10 n.3 (May 5, 2008)\n(distinguishing \"contributions to the political action committee affiliated with the Texas Classroom\nTeachers Association\" from \"association dues that members can have withheld from their paychecks\npursuant to Section 22.001, Texas Education Code\"); Brief of Texas American Federation of\nTeachers at 2 (May 5, 2008) (\"No Texas statute prohibits an independent school district from\nincluding an authorized contribution to a'political action committee when it makes the authorized\ndeduction for membership dues.\").\n\n        Accordingly, a court would likely conclude that contributions to political committees such\nas TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund are not membership fees or dues to professional organizations. As\na result, a school district would not have express authority to process payroll deductions for\ncontributions to TSTA-PAC or NEA-Fund under section 22.001 of the Education Code.\n\n       B.    Implied Authority\n\n         Having concluded that school districts do not have express authority to process payroll\ndeductions for political contributions, we turn to the question of their implied authority. School\ndistricts have implied authority to perform acts that are reasonably necessary to carry out their\nexpressly-granted duties. Geffert, 290 S.W. at 1084. A court would determine whether a statute\nimpliedly authorizes a school district's act by determining whether the act would be necessary in\norder for the district to use its statutorily-prescribed powers. See Thompson v. Elmo Indep. Sch.\nDist., 269 S.W. 868,870 (Tex. Civ. App.-Waco 1925, no writ) (noting that a school district has\nimplied powers that are indispensable, rather than merely convenient, to its declared objects and\npurposes) (citing Foster v. City o/Waco, 255 s..W: 1104, 1105-06 (Tex. 1923)).\n\n       In determining whether school districts' express authority to process payroll deductions for\nmembership fees or dues to professional organizations necessarily implies authority to process\ncontributions to political committees, we first note that TSTA appears to conclude that districts may\n\n\n       12Available at http://wWw.fec.gov/pdflcolagui.pdf(lastvisitedMay 11, 2010).\n\fThe Honorable Rob Eissler - Page 6                   (GA-0774)\n\n\n\nprocess membership dues without processing contributions to political committees. 13 Furthermore,\nschool districts may process expressly-authorized deductions for their employees' health-plan\nexpenses and child-care expenses without any apparent need to also process deductions for\ncontributions to political committees. See TEx. EDUC. CODE ANN. § 22.005 (Vernon 2006), TEx.\nINs. CODE ANN. art. 3.51 (Vernon 2009) (authorizing school districts to deduct health-care expenses\nfrom their employees' paychecks); see also TEx. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 610.021 (Vernon 2004)\n(authorizing school districts to enter into agreements with their employees to reduce their employees'\nperiodic compensation by an amount to be paid ~or child-care expenses). Compare TEx. EDUC.\nCODE ANN. § 22.002(b) (Vernon 2006) (requiring, upon satisfaction of certain requirements, a\nschool district to honor its employees' assignment, pledge, or transfer of salary or wages as security\nfor indebtedness). Thus, the Legislature's decision to grant school districts express power to process\npayroll deductions for specific purposes indicates that it did not necessarily grant school districts the\npower to process payroll deductions for non-specified purposes. See Old Am. County Mut. Insur.\nFire Co. v. Sanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1793467\"><a href=\"/opinion/1793467/old-american-cty-mut-fire-ins-co-v-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 (Tex. 2004) (presuming that every word of a statute is\nincluded or excluded for a reason); see also Brookshire v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 508 S. W.2d\n675,679 (Tex. Civ. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1974, no writ) (finding that a law did not apply to\na school district beyond the specified terms of the law because ''the 'inclusion of the specific\nlimitation excludes all others \"') (citing Harris County v. Crooker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3967336\"><a href=\"/opinion/4196759/harris-county-v-crooker/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 655 (Tex. 1923)).\n\n        Indeed, if school districts' express authority to process payroll deductions for membership\nfees or dues to professional organizations granted districts implicit authority to process deductions\nfor other purposes, the Legislature would not have granted districts express authority to process\ndeductions for other purposes, including health-care and child-care expenses. See City ofRockwall\nv. Hughes, 246 S. W.3d 621,636 (Tex. 2008) (explaining that the Legislature is presumed not to have\ndone a useless act). SeealsoAckerv. Tex. WaterComm'n, 790 S.W.2d299, 301 (Tex. 1990)(noting\nthatthe Legislature is presumed to have enacted a statute with complete knowledge of the existing\nlaw and with reference to it). Accordingly, a court would likely find that school districts do not have\nimplied statutory-authority to process payroll deductions for political committee contributions.\n\n        The conclusion that the Legislature did not impliedly grant districts authority to process\npayroll deductions for contributions to political committees is consistent with the Legislature's\ngeneral aversion to the use of public funds for political purposes. See, e.g., TEx. EDUC. CODE ANN.\n§ 11.169 (Vernon Supp. 2009) (\"Notwithstanding any other law, the board of trustees of an\nindependent school district may not use state or local funds or other resources of the district to\nelectioneer for or against any candidate, measure, or political party.\"); TEx. GOV'T CODE ANN. §\n556.004(a) (Vernon 2004) (noting that \"[a] state agency may not use any money under its control,\nincluding appropriated money, to finance or otherwise support the candidacy of a person for an office\nin the legislative, executive, or judicial branch of state government or of the government of the\nUnited States\").\n\n\n         \\3See TSTAlNEA2009-10 ENROLLMENT FORM (allowing TSTA members to authorize payroll deductions for\nTSTAINEA membership dues while declining to authorize payroll deductions for TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund\ncontributions), available athttp://www.tsta.org/includes/images/Fallform.pdf(lastvisitedMay 11,2010); see also TSTA\nBrief at 3 (noting that the amount deducted under section 22.001 of the Education Code would include a PAC\ncontribution only if the employee chooses to make a PAC contribution).\n\fThe Honorable Rob Eissler - Page 7                     (GA-,0774)\n\n\n\n\n         C.     First Amendment Freedom of Speech\n\n         We received several briefs that questioned whether prohibiting payroll deductions for\npolitical contributions would be unconstitutional. See, e.g., TSTA Brief at 4-7. The United States\nSupreme Court recently considered this question. It ruled that a state's \"ban on political payroll\ndeductions\" is \"justified by the State's interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government\nfavoritism or entanglement with partisan politics.\" Ysursa v. Pocatello Educ. Ass 'n., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145909\"><a href=\"/opinion/145909/ysursa-v-pocatello-ed-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1093</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1098 (2009). In the Ysursa case, the question before the Court was \"whether the State must\naffirmatively assist political speech by allowing public employers to administer payroll deductions\nfor political activities. For the reasons set forth in [the] opinion, the answer is no.\" Id. at 1101. The\nSupreme Court found that the state's ban on political payroll deductions did not infringe the exercise\nof First Amendment rights. Id. at 1098. Consequently, the Legislature's decision not to authorize\nschool districts to process deductions for contributions to political committees would likely\nwithstand a constitutional challenge. 14\n\n         D.     Penal Code Section 39.02\n\n        Finally, it is argued that the \"use of public resources to collect and distribute political\ndonations would appear to be a criminal misapplication of state resources which violates Penal Code\n[section] 39.02.\" Request Letter at 2-3. In order to commit an offense under section 39.02 of the\nPenal Code, a public servant would have to \"with intent to obtain a benefit or with intent to harm\nor defraud another ... intentionally or knowingly ... misuse[] government property, services,\npersonnel, or any other thing of value. \" TEx. PENAL CODE ANN. § 39 .02(a)(2) (Vemon SUpp. 2009).\nProof of a public servant's culpable mental state is a fact question that cannot be resolved in the\nopinion process. Tex. Att'y Gen. Op. No. GA-0326 (2005) at 6. Thus, we cannot determine as a\nmatter oflaw whether the processing of payroll deductions for contributions to political committees\nby school district staff on school district computers would violate Penal Code section 39.02(a)(2).\n\n\n\n\n        14Neither this opinion nor the Ysursa case affects a school district employee's right to contribute to political\ncommittees by a process other than a publicly-administered payroll deduction.\n\fThe Honorable Rob Eissler - Page 8           (GA-0774)\n\n\n\n                                     SUMMARY\n\n                     Under longstanding Texas case law, school districts have only\n             that authority expressly or impliedly granted by the Legislature.\n\n                     The Legislature expressly authorizes school districts to\n             process school district employees' payroll deductions for health-care\n             expenses, child-care costs, security for indebtedness, and membership\n             fees or dues to professional organizations. However, the Legislature\n             has not expressly authorized school districts to process payroll\n             deductions for contributions to political committees such as TSTA-\n             PAC and NEA-Fund.\n\n                      The Legislature impliedly authorizes school districts to\n             undertake those activities that school districts would need to do in\n             order to exercise the authority that the Legislature expressly granted\n             them. However, the Legislature has not impliedly authorized school\n             districts to process payroll deductions for contributions to political\n             committees such as TSTA-PAC and NEA-Fund because doing so\n             would not be necessary to perform school districts' expressly\n             authorized functions.\n\n                    Because the Legislature has not expressly or impliedly\n             authorized school districts to process payroll deductions for\n             contributions to political committees such as TSTA-PAC and NEA-\n             Fund, Texas law prohibits school' districts from processing such\n             contributions.\n\n                    The Legislature's decision notto authorize school districts to\n             process payroll deductions for contributions to political committees\n             would likely withstand a constitutional challenge.\n\n                     Proof of a public servant's culpable mental state is a fact\n             question that cannot be resolved in the opinion process. Thus, we\n             cannot determine as a matter oflaw whether the processing of payroll\n             deductions for contributions to political committees by school district\n             staff on school district computers would violate section 39.02(a)(2)\n             of the Penal Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Attorney General of Texas\n\fThe Honorable Rob Eissler - Page 9          (GA-0774)\n\n\n\nANDREW WEBER\nFirst Assistant Attorney General\n\nJONATHAN K.
