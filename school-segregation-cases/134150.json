Sec. 2000e-2(a).  After a hearing, the district court on March 30, 1971, dismissed<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the complaint as failing to state a claim entitling the appellant to relief and, therefore, did not reach the appellant's motion for a temporary restraining order.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant had submitted on affidavit attached to his complaint: That I wear my hair long, that is below the ears and below the collar in the back and styled in the vogue and fashion of the times in projection of my image of self and consistent with my consciousness of my peer group.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was quite aware that, many months before, his employer had issued grooming regulations which, as to employees in its Technical Service Department, applied to haircuts, sideburns, mustaches, beards, suits, shirts, ties and shoes.  The section dealing with \"Haircuts\" provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>Hair will be neatly trimmed and combed.  The length of the hair will taper down the back of the head and terminate above the collar.  This eliminates any appearance of long hair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's affidavit was countered, in support of the appellee's motion to dismiss, by the affidavit of one Richard Paugh, Manager of the Technical Services Branch of the National Cash Register Company which as we now paraphrase it sets out that Fagan, trained at company expense, had been in the employ of the company since March 1967, had worked in Paugh's department since January, 1969, that Fagan's duties included \"visiting the offices of customers of National Cash Register, particularly banks, for the purpose of service and repair of National Cash Register equipment, including bank proof machines, accounting machines, cash registers, adding machines and the like.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The employer in October, 1969, had received complaints from customers regarding the careless grooming of some company representatives, the Paugh affidavit continued.  The employer's policy statement noted the company's receipt of comments from customers \"regarding the extreme manner of dress and carelessness in grooming\" which had been observed respecting some employees. \"We must do everything we can to create a favorable impression on our customers and prospects.  We simply cannot afford to have our employees do otherwise by their personal appearance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The employer's policy statement of 1969 was followed in April, 1970, by the adoption of the standards of grooming above noted.  In December, 1970, the appellant was told by a superior that his hair style failed to conform to the company's requirement respecting its length.  He was shown, and he also read, the outline of the company's position, and was then told to cut his hair or not to return to work the following Monday.  He had his hair cut.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 1971, the appellant was again told to conform to the company's position or not to return to work the next day. Following a conference on March 24, 1971, when the company's memorandum of April, 1970, was again read to him, the appellant telephoned to his attorney from the meeting, and the instant case was filed on March 24, 1971.  The following day, March 25, 1971, the appellant met in the Technical Service Department with various officials and was told that he was suspended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>There are some 100 technical service employees in the Washington metropolitan area of whom none are women although there are no restrictions on the employment of both sexes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So read the Paugh affidavit in substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant now argues that the aid of a federal court is his right; indeed he claims he should prevail as a matter of law, and he has moved that summary judgment be entered in his favor.  Moreover, he has told us on brief that there is no issue of material fact.  Thus, he submits, he is entitled to judgment as he relies upon 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981, 1983, 2000e-2(a) and on the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Fagan here has insisted upon his claim of right to wear his hair in a self-determined manner, indeed he contends that his employer's action constitutes an invasion of \"liberties and privacy.\"  To support his position he has cited to us various cases where some courts have stricken as invalid school board rules prescribing unacceptable hair length for students.  Some of such cases have been based upon equal protection grounds, others have viewed \"long hair\" proscription as a denial of due process. Yet others have purported to see a deprivation of rights within the ambit of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, in yet other cases, no constitutional deprivation has been perceived,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and no \"rights\" have been recognized as requiring or even as justifying the interposition of federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the District Court in Karr v. Schmidt, 320 F.Supp. 728 (W.D.Tex. 1970), ruled that the local standard hair length regulation violated the due process and equal protection clauses, its judgment was stayed and Justice Black refused to vacate the stay.  His memorandum, 401 U.S. 1201, 1202, 91 S.Ct. 592, 27 L.Ed.2d 797 (1971), reflected his view that the federal courts have no constitutional power to interfere with regulations promulgated by a public school system.  The Fifth Circuit, en banc, 1972, 460 F.2d 609, not only reversed the District Court, but announced a per se rule directing the district courts thereafter to dismiss, forthwith, for failure to state a valid claim, a complaint which \"merely alleges the constitutional invalidity of a high school hair and grooming regulation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A variant was next considered in Landsdale v. Tyler Jr. College, 470 F.2d 659, where the Fifth Circuit again sat en banc.  The Court's opinion, October 4, 1972, noted that the college was a public institution of the State of Texas, to be sure, but distinguished the Karr holding since the State's right by regulation to intrude upon a personal liberty to wear long hair \"stops at the college gate.\"  The student is not required to go to college, but until that departure, the State was bound to educate him through high school.  The numerous dissenting expressions reiterate previous views.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Judge Brown, concurring in the majority Landsdale opinion, not only cited Judge Tuttle's memorandum in Sherling, supra, note 7, but emphasized Judge Wisdom's dissent in Karr, 460 F.2d at 619.  There, after a bow in the direction of Mr. Justice Black's position, 401 U.S. 1201, 1202, 91 S.Ct. 592, 27 L.Ed.2d 797, supra, Judge Wisdom in note 1, expressed himself as \"still unwilling to ascribe a similar view to the Supreme Court as a whole.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever significance any of us ever may be wont to attach to the denial of certiorari, the Supreme Court \"as a whole\" denied certiorari as of November 6, 1972 in Karr v. Schmidt, 409 U.S. 989, 93 S.Ct. 307, 34 L.Ed.2d 256.  By that time Karr, Landsdale, Sherling, Freeman, Olff, Jackson (see cases cited in note 6, supra) had been available to the Court.  Only Mr. Justice Douglas had voted to grant certiorari,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> indeed it is clear from the cases cited in notes 5 and 6, supra, that a petitioner for cert. in these hair situations was to get nowhere-whether he had prevailed in the lower courts or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We may fairly assume this much, it would appear, the Supreme Court sees no federal question in this area.  We are persuaded that the only basis upon which Fagan might predicate a claim must stem from 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(a) (1) and (2) to which we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Basically, throughout, the gravamen of Fagan's position has been that his employer unlawfully had discriminated against him because of his sex.  Accordingly as a matter of convenience, we set out the pertinent portion of 42 U.S. C. Sec. 2000e-2, Unlawful employment practices-Employer practices</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer-</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities . . . because of such individual's . . . sex . . ..</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), the Court found itself confronted with a question of first impression.  It then explained at 429-430, 91 S.Ct. at 853:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>The objective of Congress in the enactment of Title VII is plain from the language of the statute.  It was to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees.  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court then at 431, 91 S.Ct. at 853 again emphasized:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>Discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has proscribed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, the Court in Griggs was considering the problem of discrimination<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> on the basis of a racial classification.  However, what was there seen to be the Congressional purpose was merely an extension of what had been said succinctly in Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corporation, 400 U.S. 542, 91 S.Ct. 496, 27 L. Ed.2d 613 (1971), vacating Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corporation (5 Cir. 1969), 416 F.2d 1257.  The Supreme Court after noting that persons of like qualifications must be given employment opportunities, irrespective of their sex, found error in the lower court's permitting one hiring policy for women and another for men, each having pre-school age children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Random sampling of the views of various courts of appeals and district courts yields the consistently stated principle, as in Martin Marietta, supra, that women are to be afforded job opportunities on an equal footing with men.  For example, a weight-lifting qualification discriminated against women on the ground of sex where no such barrier was erected against male employees.  Bowe v. Colgate-Palmolive Company (7 Cir. 1969), 416 F.2d 711.  In Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (5 Cir. 1969), 408 F.2d 228, the plaintiff-appellant was denied a switchman's job because she was a woman.  Schaeffer v. San Diego Yellow Cabs, Inc.  (9 Cir. 1972), 462 F.2d 1002, found discrimination against women where men could work a nine-hour day but women were limited to an eight-hour stint.  La Fleur v. Cleveland Board of Education (6 Cir. 1972), 465 F.2d 1184, saw invidious discrimination based on sex because of enforced maternity leave without pay.  The Fifth Circuit in 1971 saw sex discrimination in Danner v. Phillips Petroleum Company, 447 F.2d 159, where women were excluded from achieving seniority rights which were awarded to males, and where, indeed, this otherwise qualified plaintiff-appellant was laid off and her job was given to a man.  Even in advertising for help, exclusion of opportunity for one sex created unacceptable discrimination against the other, the court found in Hailes v. United Air Lines (5 Cir. 1972), 464 F.2d 1006.  Sex differentials in opportunities for earning overtime pay engaged the court in Hays v. Potlatch Forests, Inc.  (8 Cir. 1972), 465 F.2d 1081, where women, but not men, working overtime were to receive time and a half, thus discriminating against male employees.  Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc.  (7 Cir. 1961), 444 F.2d 1194, considered the employer's no-marriage policy as applied to stewardesses where no such rule obtained against males.  The majority found discrimination on the ground of sex over the critical dissent of Judge Stevens, 444 F.2d at 1202-1206, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 991, 92 S.Ct. 536, 30 L.Ed. 2d 543 (1971).  Diaz v. Pan American World Airways, Inc.  (5 Cir. 1971), 442 F.2d 385, involved sex discrimination against a man who sought the position of flight cabin attendant where company hiring terms had restricted such opportunities to females.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would seem inescapable that Congress was saying that job opportunities must be opened, remain open, and not be denied or terminated because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.  The language is plain, and as here considered means that men and women so far as jobs are concerned must receive equal treatment and not be the objects of discrimination on the ground of sex.  Thus speaks the Act and so spoke Judge Hamley in Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Company, note 12, supra, at 1223:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Southern Pacific's employment policy under which, for example, it has denied Mrs. Rosenfeld an employment assignment on the ground that women, considered generically, are not physically or biologically suited for such work, results in distinguishing employees, thus discriminating against some because of sex, within the meaning of subsection (1) of this provision.  It also constitutes a limitation upon, segregation of, or classification of the company's employees in a way which would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of employment opportunities because of such individual's sex, within the meaning of subsection (2) of the quoted section.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases we have cited here in Part II clearly demonstrate how the courts have appraised the Congressional purpose to establish that persons of like qualifications are to be given employment opportunities irrespective of their sex.  Certainly on our record there is no evidence of discrimination against women.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point we may note that in support of appellant's claim of aggrievement, his affidavit as submitted to EEOC, continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>. . . That the company has a policy against males wearing hair long and styled in the manner mine is and has no such policy with reference to the manner and mode that women employees must wear their hair . . . and I am informed most recently that unless I have my hair cut to conform to store policy before Thursday, March 25th, 1971, I will be discharged from my employment for failure to comply with company policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant thus would predicate his claim of discrimination because of sex for he then refused to cut his hair and his employment was terminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike discriminatory situations which arose in cases cited in Part II, supra, no woman here complained of the company's policy.  There is no suggestion that any woman had ever sought or had been denied employment in the Technical Service Department.  There were no company restrictions on the employment of both sexes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Clearly Fagan had not been denied employment because he was a male, indeed he had been an employee of the company since 1969, and prior to the March episode, he had brought himself into compliance with company policy.  The Paugh affidavit further reveals that in the Washington Metropolitan area there are about one hundred technical service employees like Fagan whose duties included visiting the offices of the company's customers, particularly banks, for the purpose of service and repair of company equipment, adding machines, cash registers and the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If while engaged in company service Fagan had been required to wear a company prescribed uniform,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> there could be no valid claim of discrimination on the ground of sex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have then a situation where a male was indeed employed, and with full knowledge of the company's policy, insisted upon performing his work on his own terms and upon requiring the company to accommodate to his projection of his own image.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  He claimed the \"right\" to wear his hair \"styled in my personal projection or image in the development of my personality.\"  He admitted on affidavit that \"If I would get my hair cut I could come back . . . to work the next morning.\"  In last analysis, we read his claim not as a challenge to the right of the employer to require Fagan to wear his hair in a shorter style but as urging that in order for the company legally to do so, it must require women to conform to the grooming style applicable to males, even though there are no women employees here involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are quite aware that completely sincere and earnest jurists may differ from others of equal competence in their appraisal of legal issues and the conclusions deemed essential to their resolution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Hair-length cases in the private sector are no less a problem than the \"State\" cases treated in Part I, supra.  Courts in the very area under consideration have varied in their approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, Rafford v. Randle Eastern Ambulance Service, Inc., 348 F. Supp. 316 (D.Fla., Miami Div., 1972), taught us that there was no discrimination based on sex where men refused to shave their beards.  The employer had prescribed no policy concerning the length of hair for either men or women, and the plaintiffs had never been disciplined or discriminated against because of their hair length or because of sex.  The employer, it was decided, may not apply a standard to one sex which varies from that applicable to the other.

Shoe Corporation of America, 337 F.Supp. 1357, 1359 (Cal.C.D.1972).  The employer there had not pleaded or established the defense of a \"bona fide occupational qualification\" where the plaintiff, a shoe salesman in contact with the public, was discharged for wearing long hair although women were allowed to do so.  Since there was a hiring or retention standard applicable to one sex and not to the other, the employer's motion to dismiss was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier we could have seen Roberts v. General Mills, Inc., 337 F.Supp. 1055 (N.D.Ohio W.D.1971), where the operator of a food-processing plant had classified its employees, requiring that men wear hats while women were permitted to wear harinets.  Thus the Act was said to have been violated since the company would not allow Roberts to grow his hair as long as that worn by women in the same department.  Roberts wanted to wear a hairnet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aros v. McDonnell Douglas Corporation, 348 F.Supp. 661 (C.D.Cal.1972), found that three employees had been terminated because their jobs were phased out.  Their casual dress, their illgroomed hair, failure to report on time and other grounds for possible employer dissatisfaction did not deter discussion to the effect that where an employeegrooming code for males differed from that prescribed for females, a discrimination based on sex could be seen.  Realizing that an employer has \"every right\" to adopt dress codes suitable to various job categories, the opinion read that a particular code must apply equally to everyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, we see a differing point of view in Baker v. California Land Title Company, 349 F.Supp. 235, 237-238 (C.D.Cal.1972).  Making some sense as to claimed discrimination \"because of sex\" the court referred to the meager legislative history of the \"sex\" amendment.  Then the opinion explained the real purpose of the language.  Congress sought to establish equal occupational opportunities, an equal right to available employment, equal pay for equal work and equal working conditions.  It was not planned that the Act was \"[to] be used to interfere in the promulgation and enforcement of the general rules of employment, deemed essential by an employer, where the direct or indirect economic effect upon the employee was nominal or non-existent.\"  Specifically rejecting Donohue v. Shoe Corporation of America, supra, the judge said the Act was never intended to permit an employee to set in motion either federal or state employment machinery \"merely because he wishes to wear his hair longer than the company rules prescribe.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bit closer to home, we now turn to Boyce v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 351 F. Supp. 402 (D.D.C.1972).  There finding that \"no substantive issue is presented,\" Judge Gesell granted summary judgment for the defendant.  There were grooming standards for female employees as well as for males.  It was not unreasonable for an employer to expect differences in grooming between men and women, it was observed.  The judge found no sex-based discrimination where a male food clerk was discharged because his head and facial hair failed to conform to the employer's grooming standards applicable to male employees having regular contact with the public.  Obviously aware of the incongruity of the argument advanced before him, the judge took account of Diaz v. Pan American Airways, Inc., Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corporation and Griggs v. Duke Power Co.  (all treated in our Part II, supra).  He commented, correctly we think, that the courts in those cases struck down \"outmoded and unjustifiable sex stereotypes . . . [which] had distinct employment opportunity disadvantages for one sex.\"  He noted that Safeway had</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>sought to establish a clear and concise written rule for the grooming of its public-contact employees, male and female, so that those employees will be protected from arbitrary and unreviewable decisions by individual store managers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>******</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>We quote further:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>Congress by this Act did not give the federal courts the task of deciding whether hair at the collar level or one-half inch below is a bona fide occupational qualification.  Such a suggestion is absurd; such a task borders on the non-justiciable.  Safeway's grooming code is not arbitrary, and for its public-contact employees, serving as its only sales force, such a reasonable code is a bona fide occupational qualification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Gesell found no unlawful discrimination because of sex.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantially similar treatment to the problem was accorded by Judge Bootle in Willingham v. Macon Telegraph Publishing Company, 352 F.Supp. 1018 (Georgia M.D.1972) (appeal pending).  There, it was observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>What the defendant does require is that plaintiff conform to standards of appearance which the defendant feels are necessary to the conduct of his business.  It is not unreasonable for an employer to expect differences in grooming between men and women-and such expectations are not indicative of sexual treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Bootle saw the plaintiff's argument as calling for an expansion of the Act far beyond what must have been the purpose of its enactment.  Tracing out what might be the end result of plaintiff's argument, the Judge commented that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>it must logically follow that men, if they choose, could not be prevented by the employer from wearing dresses to work if the employer permitted women to wear dresses . . . [which] would discriminate against the rights of men, and such discrimination would be present in the same manner as it would be present when men are prohibited by employers from wearing long hair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We may well subscribe to Judge Bootle's view that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>employers, like employees, have rights.  This court, without a far more certain mandate from Congress than that contained in Title VII, will not be party to what it considers a ridiculous, unwarranted encroachment on a fundamental right of employers, i. e., the right to prescribe reasonable grooming standards which take cognizance of societal mores.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sustaining the employer's motion for summary judgment dismissing the action, the Judge concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>Clearly [he] has the right to wear his hair as he pleases, but correspondingly, the defendant has the right to expect its employees to groom and conduct themselves in such a way as to promote the best interest of its business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find ourselves persuaded by the reasoning and the treatment to be seen in Baker v. California Land Title Company, supra, Boyce v. Safeway Stores, Inc., supra, and Willingham v. Macon Telegraph Publishing Company, supra, and comment further in light of the record in this case where the appellant has insisted he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps no facet of business life is more important than a company's place in public estimation.  That the image created by its employees dealing with the public when on company assignment affects its relations is so well known that we may take judicial notice of an employer's proper desire to achieve favorable acceptance.  Good grooming regulations reflect a company's policy in our highly competitive business environment.  Reasonable requirements in furtherance of that policy are an aspect of managerial responsibility.  Congress has said that no exercise of that responsibility may result in discriminatory deprivation of equal opportunity because of immutable race, national origin, color, or sex classification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So to say is a far cry from a conclusion that the length of one's hair is either constitutionally or statutorily protected.  More remotely is it to be discerned as discrimination because of sex, when employees' hair length fails to conform to an employer's reasonable requirements, designed to further the company's legitimate interests.  Clearly there are \"societal as well as personal interests\" so involved in providing equal opportunities for citizens, that an employer is not to be permitted under the Act to discriminate because of grounds \"resulting from forces beyond [the employees'] control.\"  Discrimination on such grounds is not to be \"allowed to work a cumulative and invidious burden upon such citizens for the remainder of their lives.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But equally it seems obvious to us, that one seeking an employment opportunity as in our situation where hair length readily can be changed, may be required to conform to reasonable grooming standards designed to further the employing company's interest by which that very opportunity is provided.  There is no suggestion that the company regulation is pretextual or that it has been derived otherwise than in complete good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has cited to us the Commission's decision in EEOC case No. 1/AU9-545 where the Commission concluded that the employer had acted in violation of Title VII of the Act by refusing to hire, because of his sex, a male production worker with shoulder-length hair, and otherwise by refusing to hire females as production workers because of their sex, and by maintaining a height requirement which discriminates against females as a class because of their sex and Spanish surnamed American males as a class because of their national origin.  It has been argued that the agency decision is entitled to \"great deference\" citing us to Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, 401 U.S. where at 433-434, 91 S.Ct. 849 the Court was discussing the Commission's interpretation of Section 703(h) of the Act.  The Court had already perceived the Congressional purpose to eliminate discrimination because of race noting that what Congress sought was \"plain from the language of the statute.\"   Id. at 429, 91 S.Ct. at 853.  Then the Court at 434, 91 S.Ct. at 855 explained its having accorded deference to the Commission's interpretation thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>Since the Act and its legislative history support the Commission's construction, this affords good reason to treat the guidelines as expressing the will of Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, neither the Act nor its legislative history even remotely predicated an instance of discrimination \"because of sex\" on the length of an employee's hair worn in contravention of the employer's good grooming regulations.  Courts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>\"are not obliged to stand aside and rubber-stamp their affirmance of administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute.\"  NLRB v. Brown, 380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S.Ct. 980, 988, 13 L.Ed.2d 839.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find ourselves quite unwilling, respecting the male's long hair aspect, to accept as discrimination because of sex the Commission's decision, above cited, as based upon its own expanded reading of the statute and not comporting with the repeatedly declared objectives which Congress sought to achieve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our respected colleague points to Section 703(a) of the Act as interpreted by Mr. Justice Marshall in Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542, 544 et seq., 91 S.Ct. 496, 27 L.Ed.2d 613 (1971).  Mr. Justice Marshall would adopt the guidelines and regulations as promulgated by EEOC.  He alone rejected the majority ruling.  He thought his colleagues had fallen into a trap.  He thought an employer can require his employees, both men and women, to meet minimum performance standards and can even require parents to provide for the care of their children \"so that job performance is not interfered with.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the majority held was that persons of like qualifications are to be given employment opportunities irrespective of their sex.  The majority said that the condition of the hiring policy there under consideration might be met under the circumstances outlined in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(e).  Thus evidence could be received to show that a bona fide occupational qualification is \"reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.\"  (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it was that the majority remanded since the record was not adequate \"for resolution of these important issues.\"  Id. at 544, 91 S.Ct. at 498.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here we face no such problem.  Fagan has insisted that there are no issues of material fact.  The Paugh affidavit was before the district judge as was Fagan's affidavit in support of his position.  The district judge was satisfied that on this record the employer had established the basis for its reasonable requirement that its grooming standards be complied with.  It was thereupon concluded that Fagan had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and the complaint was dismissed accordingly.  We think he reached a right result but the judgment will be modified that the basis may correctly appear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">WRIGHT, Circuit Judge (dissenting):</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has made clear that Section 703 (a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits \"one hiring policy for women and another for men.\"  Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542, 544, 91 S.Ct. 496, 27 L.Ed.2d 613 (1971).  By passing Section 703(a) \"Congress intended to prevent employers from refusing 'to hire an individual based on stereotyped characterizations of the sexes.' \"   Id. at 545, 91 S.Ct. at 498.  (Mr. Justice Marshall concurring).  Thus the question presented by this case is simply whether appellee's \"no long hair for male employees only\" policy \"is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.\" 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(e) (1970). This exception to the prohibition in Section 703(a) against sex discrimination in employment is \"applicable only to job situations that require specific physical characteristics necessarily possessed by only one sex.\"   Phillips, supra, at 545-546, 91 S.Ct. at 498 (Marshall, J., concurring).  And the burden of proof is on the employer.

Under the circumstances, as in Phillips, I would reverse and remand to the District Court to give appellee the opportunity to prove, if it can, that its policy comes within the exception provided in Section 703(e) of the Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  See Willingham v.

Hair growth is symbolic to many of rebellion against traditional society and disapproval of the way the current power structure handles social problems.  Taken as an affirmative declaration of an individual's commitment to a change in social values, \"non-conventional\" hair growth may become a very real personal threat to those who support the status quo.  For those people, \"non-conventional\" hair growth symbolizes an undesirable life-style characterized by unreliability, dishonesty, lack of moral values, communial (\"communist\") tendencies, and the assumption of drug use.

Sec. 2000e-2(a).  After a hearing, the district court on March 30, 1971, dismissed<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the complaint as failing to state a claim entitling the appellant to relief and, therefore, did not reach the appellant's motion for a temporary restraining order.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant had submitted on affidavit attached to his complaint: That I wear my hair long, that is below the ears and below the collar in the back and styled in the vogue and fashion of the times in projection of my image of self and consistent with my consciousness of my peer group.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was quite aware that, many months before, his employer had issued grooming regulations which, as to employees in its Technical Service Department, applied to haircuts, sideburns, mustaches, beards, suits, shirts, ties and shoes.  The section dealing with \"Haircuts\" provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>Hair will be neatly trimmed and combed.  The length of the hair will taper down the back of the head and terminate above the collar.  This eliminates any appearance of long hair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's affidavit was countered, in support of the appellee's motion to dismiss, by the affidavit of one Richard Paugh, Manager of the Technical Services Branch of the National Cash Register Company which as we now paraphrase it sets out that Fagan, trained at company expense, had been in the employ of the company since March 1967, had worked in Paugh's department since January, 1969, that Fagan's duties included \"visiting the offices of customers of National Cash Register, particularly banks, for the purpose of service and repair of National Cash Register equipment, including bank proof machines, accounting machines, cash registers, adding machines and the like.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The employer in October, 1969, had received complaints from customers regarding the careless grooming of some company representatives, the Paugh affidavit continued.  The employer's policy statement noted the company's receipt of comments from customers \"regarding the extreme manner of dress and carelessness in grooming\" which had been observed respecting some employees. \"We must do everything we can to create a favorable impression on our customers and prospects.  We simply cannot afford to have our employees do otherwise by their personal appearance.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The employer's policy statement of 1969 was followed in April, 1970, by the adoption of the standards of grooming above noted.  In December, 1970, the appellant was told by a superior that his hair style failed to conform to the company's requirement respecting its length.  He was shown, and he also read, the outline of the company's position, and was then told to cut his hair or not to return to work the following Monday.  He had his hair cut.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 1971, the appellant was again told to conform to the company's position or not to return to work the next day. Following a conference on March 24, 1971, when the company's memorandum of April, 1970, was again read to him, the appellant telephoned to his attorney from the meeting, and the instant case was filed on March 24, 1971.  The following day, March 25, 1971, the appellant met in the Technical Service Department with various officials and was told that he was suspended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>There are some 100 technical service employees in the Washington metropolitan area of whom none are women although there are no restrictions on the employment of both sexes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So read the Paugh affidavit in substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant now argues that the aid of a federal court is his right; indeed he claims he should prevail as a matter of law, and he has moved that summary judgment be entered in his favor.  Moreover, he has told us on brief that there is no issue of material fact.  Thus, he submits, he is entitled to judgment as he relies upon 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981, 1983, 2000e-2(a) and on the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Fagan here has insisted upon his claim of right to wear his hair in a self-determined manner, indeed he contends that his employer's action constitutes an invasion of \"liberties and privacy.\"  To support his position he has cited to us various cases where some courts have stricken as invalid school board rules prescribing unacceptable hair length for students.  Some of such cases have been based upon equal protection grounds, others have viewed \"long hair\" proscription as a denial of due process. Yet others have purported to see a deprivation of rights within the ambit of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, in yet other cases, no constitutional deprivation has been perceived,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and no \"rights\" have been recognized as requiring or even as justifying the interposition of federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the District Court in Karr v.

The language is plain, and as here considered means that men and women so far as jobs are concerned must receive equal treatment and not be the objects of discrimination on the ground of sex.  Thus speaks the Act and so spoke Judge Hamley in Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Company, note 12, supra, at 1223:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Southern Pacific's employment policy under which, for example, it has denied Mrs. Rosenfeld an employment assignment on the ground that women, considered generically, are not physically or biologically suited for such work, results in distinguishing employees, thus discriminating against some because of sex, within the meaning of subsection (1) of this provision.  It also constitutes a limitation upon, segregation of, or classification of the company's employees in a way which would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of employment opportunities because of such individual's sex, within the meaning of subsection (2) of the quoted section.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases we have cited here in Part II clearly demonstrate how the courts have appraised the Congressional purpose to establish that persons of like qualifications are to be given employment opportunities irrespective of their sex.  Certainly on our record there is no evidence of discrimination against women.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point we may note that in support of appellant's claim of aggrievement, his affidavit as submitted to EEOC, continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>. . . That the company has a policy against males wearing hair long and styled in the manner mine is and has no such policy with reference to the manner and mode that women employees must wear their hair . . . and I am informed most recently that unless I have my hair cut to conform to store policy before Thursday, March 25th, 1971, I will be discharged from my employment for failure to comply with company policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant thus would predicate his claim of discrimination because of sex for he then refused to cut his hair and his employment was terminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike discriminatory situations which arose in cases cited in Part II, supra, no woman here complained of the company's policy.  There is no suggestion that any woman had ever sought or had been denied employment in the Technical Service Department.  There were no company restrictions on the employment of both sexes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Clearly Fagan had not been denied employment because he was a male, indeed he had been an employee of the company since 1969, and prior to the March episode, he had brought himself into compliance with company policy.  The Paugh affidavit further reveals that in the Washington Metropolitan area there are about one hundred technical service employees like Fagan whose duties included visiting the offices of the company's customers, particularly banks, for the purpose of service and repair of company equipment, adding machines, cash registers and the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If while engaged in company service Fagan had been required to wear a company prescribed uniform,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> there could be no valid claim of discrimination on the ground of sex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have then a situation where a male was indeed employed, and with full knowledge of the company's policy, insisted upon performing his work on his own terms and upon requiring the company to accommodate to his projection of his own image.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  He claimed the \"right\" to wear his hair \"styled in my personal projection or image in the development of my personality.\"  He admitted on affidavit that \"If I would get my hair cut I could come back . . . to work the next morning.\"  In last analysis, we read his claim not as a challenge to the right of the employer to require Fagan to wear his hair in a shorter style but as urging that in order for the company legally to do so, it must require women to conform to the grooming style applicable to males, even though there are no women employees here involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are quite aware that completely sincere and earnest jurists may differ from others of equal competence in their appraisal of legal issues and the conclusions deemed essential to their resolution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Hair-length cases in the private sector are no less a problem than the \"State\" cases treated in Part I, supra.

The employer had prescribed no policy concerning the length of hair for either men or women, and the plaintiffs had never been disciplined or discriminated against because of their hair length or because of sex.  The employer, it was decided, may not apply a standard to one sex which varies from that applicable to the other.  The district judge noted that beards are a special male characteristic.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court saw the problem in terms of Section 2000e-2(e) in Donohue v.

The employer there had not pleaded or established the defense of a \"bona fide occupational qualification\" where the plaintiff, a shoe salesman in contact with the public, was discharged for wearing long hair although women were allowed to do so.  Since there was a hiring or retention standard applicable to one sex and not to the other, the employer's motion to dismiss was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier we could have seen Roberts v.

Thus the Act was said to have been violated since the company would not allow Roberts to grow his hair as long as that worn by women in the same department.

Their casual dress, their illgroomed hair, failure to report on time and other grounds for possible employer dissatisfaction did not deter discussion to the effect that where an employeegrooming code for males differed from that prescribed for females, a discrimination based on sex could be seen.  Realizing that an employer has \"every right\" to adopt dress codes suitable to various job categories, the opinion read that a particular code must apply equally to everyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, we see a differing point of view in Baker v.

Making some sense as to claimed discrimination \"because of sex\" the court referred to the meager legislative history of the \"sex\" amendment.  Then the opinion explained the real purpose of the language.  Congress sought to establish equal occupational opportunities, an equal right to available employment, equal pay for equal work and equal working conditions.  It was not planned that the Act was \"[to] be used to interfere in the promulgation and enforcement of the general rules of employment, deemed essential by an employer, where the direct or indirect economic effect upon the employee was nominal or non-existent.\"  Specifically rejecting Donohue v. Shoe Corporation of America, supra, the judge said the Act was never intended to permit an employee to set in motion either federal or state employment machinery \"merely because he wishes to wear his hair longer than the company rules prescribe.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bit closer to home, we now turn to Boyce v.

There were grooming standards for female employees as well as for males.  It was not unreasonable for an employer to expect differences in grooming between men and women, it was observed.  The judge found no sex-based discrimination where a male food clerk was discharged because his head and facial hair failed to conform to the employer's grooming standards applicable to male employees having regular contact with the public.  Obviously aware of the incongruity of the argument advanced before him, the judge took account of Diaz v. Pan American Airways, Inc., Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corporation and Griggs v. Duke Power Co.  (all treated in our Part II, supra).  He commented, correctly we think, that the courts in those cases struck down \"outmoded and unjustifiable sex stereotypes . . .

Such a suggestion is absurd; such a task borders on the non-justiciable.  Safeway's grooming code is not arbitrary, and for its public-contact employees, serving as its only sales force, such a reasonable code is a bona fide occupational qualification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Gesell found no unlawful discrimination because of sex.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantially similar treatment to the problem was accorded by Judge Bootle in Willingham v.

Tracing out what might be the end result of plaintiff's argument, the Judge commented that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>it must logically follow that men, if they choose, could not be prevented by the employer from wearing dresses to work if the employer permitted women to wear dresses . . . [which] would discriminate against the rights of men, and such discrimination would be present in the same manner as it would be present when men are prohibited by employers from wearing long hair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We may well subscribe to Judge Bootle's view that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>employers, like employees, have rights.  This court, without a far more certain mandate from Congress than that contained in Title VII, will not be party to what it considers a ridiculous, unwarranted encroachment on a fundamental right of employers, i. e., the right to prescribe reasonable grooming standards which take cognizance of societal mores.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sustaining the employer's motion for summary judgment dismissing the action, the Judge concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>Clearly [he] has the right to wear his hair as he pleases, but correspondingly, the defendant has the right to expect its employees to groom and conduct themselves in such a way as to promote the best interest of its business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find ourselves persuaded by the reasoning and the treatment to be seen in Baker v. California Land Title Company, supra, Boyce v. Safeway Stores, Inc., supra, and Willingham v. Macon Telegraph Publishing Company, supra, and comment further in light of the record in this case where the appellant has insisted he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps no facet of business life is more important than a company's place in public estimation.  That the image created by its employees dealing with the public when on company assignment affects its relations is so well known that we may take judicial notice of an employer's proper desire to achieve favorable acceptance.  Good grooming regulations reflect a company's policy in our highly competitive business environment.  Reasonable requirements in furtherance of that policy are an aspect of managerial responsibility.  Congress has said that no exercise of that responsibility may result in discriminatory deprivation of equal opportunity because of immutable race, national origin, color, or sex classification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So to say is a far cry from a conclusion that the length of one's hair is either constitutionally or statutorily protected.  More remotely is it to be discerned as discrimination because of sex, when employees' hair length fails to conform to an employer's reasonable requirements, designed to further the company's legitimate interests.  Clearly there are \"societal as well as personal interests\" so involved in providing equal opportunities for citizens, that an employer is not to be permitted under the Act to discriminate because of grounds \"resulting from forces beyond [the employees'] control.\"  Discrimination on such grounds is not to be \"allowed to work a cumulative and invidious burden upon such citizens for the remainder of their lives.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But equally it seems obvious to us, that one seeking an employment opportunity as in our situation where hair length readily can be changed, may be required to conform to reasonable grooming standards designed to further the employing company's interest by which that very opportunity is provided.  There is no suggestion that the company regulation is pretextual or that it has been derived otherwise than in complete good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has cited to us the Commission's decision in EEOC case No. 1/AU9-545 where the Commission concluded that the employer had acted in violation of Title VII of the Act by refusing to hire, because of his sex, a male production worker with shoulder-length hair, and otherwise by refusing to hire females as production workers because of their sex, and by maintaining a height requirement which discriminates against females as a class because of their sex and Spanish surnamed American males as a class because of their national origin.

The majority said that the condition of the hiring policy there under consideration might be met under the circumstances outlined in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(e).  Thus evidence could be received to show that a bona fide occupational qualification is \"reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.\"  (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it was that the majority remanded since the record was not adequate \"for resolution of these important issues.\"  Id. at 544, 91 S.Ct. at 498.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here we face no such problem.

It was thereupon concluded that Fagan had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and the complaint was dismissed accordingly.

(Mr. Justice Marshall concurring).

Hair growth is symbolic to many of rebellion against traditional society and disapproval of the way the current power structure handles social problems.  Taken as an affirmative declaration of an individual's commitment to a change in social values, \"non-conventional\" hair growth may become a very real personal threat to those who support the status quo.  For those people, \"non-conventional\" hair growth symbolizes an undesirable life-style characterized by unreliability, dishonesty, lack of moral values, communial (\"communist\") tendencies, and the assumption of drug use.
