No. 1:06-CV-01620-CBS-KMT)\n\n\nSubmitted on the briefs:*\n\nJanos Toevs, Plaintiff-Appellant, Pro se.\n\nAndrew M. Katarikawe, Senior Assistant Attorney General, Civil Litigation and\nEmployment Law Section, John W. Suthers, Attorney General, Denver, Colorado for\nDefendants-Appellees.\n\n\n\n\n*\n       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this\nappeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered\nsubmitted without oral argument.\n\fBefore MATHESON, McKAY, and EBEL, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nEBEL, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n       Janos Toevs, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment to defendants in his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil-rights suit. Mr. Toevs argues that\n\nthe court erred in granting qualified immunity to defendants on his claim that they denied\n\nhim meaningful periodic reviews during his lengthy confinement in administrative\n\nsegregation. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm, although on\n\ndifferent grounds than the district court.\n\n       The district court concluded that Mr. Toevs failed to demonstrate that defendants\n\nviolated his constitutional rights. We disagree. Based on the record and the arguments\n\nbefore this court, Mr. Toevs was entitled to meaningful periodic reviews during his\n\nplacement in administrative segregation in the Colorado prison system’s Quality of Life\n\nLevel Program (QLLP) because the exclusive justification for keeping Mr. Toevs in\n\nadministrative segregation was to influence him to modify his future behavior. However,\n\nthe record at this state of the proceeding does not establish that Mr. Toevs was given\n\nmeaningful reviews and Mr. Toevs denies receiving any such reviews. If this were the\n\nend of the analysis we would have to conclude that summary judgment for defendants on\n\nthe merits was improper and we would have to remand for further consideration by the\n\ndistrict court of the reviews given to Mr. Toevs, including the penological interests of the\n\nprison in this process. On the merits, it was certainly error to grant summary judgment to\n\n                                             -2-\n\fdefendants on this issue.   Nevertheless, because at the time it was not clearly established\n\nthat the review process should apply throughout each level of the QLLP and that the\n\nperfunctory reviews given to Mr. Toevs at Levels 1-3 and the failure to provide any\n\nreviews whatsoever at Levels 4-6 would not be considered meaningful given the\n\nrehabilitative justification for this segregation program, we conclude that defendants are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, instead of remanding for further\n\nproceedings, we are able to affirm summary judgment for the defendants upon this\n\nalternative ground.\n\n       The administrative segregation placement in this case involves a prisoner in a\n\nColorado stratified incentive program with the sole stated purpose of encouraging him to\n\nimprove his future behavior. Therefore, this case addresses, exclusively, the standards for\n\nperiodic reviews during placement in this program.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       The QLLP is described in Operational Memorandum (OM) 650-100. The\n\nprogram, which is employed at Colorado State Penitentiary (CSP) and Centennial\n\nCorrectional Facility (CCF), is “a stratified quality of life program based on increased\n\nlevels of privileges for demonstrated appropriate offender behavior and program\n\ncompliance.” OM 650-100 § I, R. at 610. The program consists of six levels.1 Level 1\n\n\n1\n        After the panel issued its original opinion in this case, in seeking rehearing\ndefendants suggested that the case was moot because the structure of the QLLP had\nchanged. But it is defendants’ burden to “com[e] forward with the subsequent events”\nthat allegedly have resulted in mootness, Greater Yellowstone Coalition v. Tidwell, 572\n\n                                             -3-\n\fhas the most restrictive conditions, and each successive level offers the inmate more\n\nprivileges.\n\n       Levels 1 through 3 are classified as administrative segregation. Accordingly, they\n\nare subject to the provisions of Administrative Regulation (AR) 600-02, which governs\n\nplacement in administrative segregation. AR 600-02 provides for periodic reviews of\n\nsegregation status. Levels 4 through 6 are classified as close custody. AR 600-02 does\n\nnot cover these levels, and defendants concede that there is no review process applicable\n\nto them. After completing QLLP Level 6, an inmate is eligible to be transferred to the\n\ngeneral prison population. If an inmate spends the minimum amount of time at each\n\nlevel, he will be in the QLLP for thirteen months and seven days. There is no maximum\n\namount of time for placement in the QLLP.\n\n       Mr. Toevs was placed in the QLLP on March 4, 2002, after attempting to escape.\n\nBy September 2005, he had reached Level 6, but due to poor behavior he was regressed to\n\nLevel 1. He again began to progress through the program, achieving Level 1 on October\n\n7, 2005; Level 2 on October 13, 2005; Level 3 in either December 2005 or January 2006;\n\nand Level 4 on October 15, 2007. On January 31, 2009, Mr. Toevs completed Level 6\n\n\n\nF.3d 1115, 1121 (10th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted), and defendants’ vague suggestions\nof changes to the QLLP fail to carry that burden. Further, it appears that a suggestion of\nmootness made in connection with seeking rehearing may come too late. See Cardinal\nChem. Co. v. Morton Int’l, Inc., 508 U.S. 83, 98 (1993) (“If, before the court had decided\nthe case, either party had advised it of a material change in circumstances that entirely\nterminated the party’s controversy, it would have been proper either to dismiss the appeal\nor to vacate the entire judgment of the District Court.” (emphasis added)). Furthermore,\nMr. Toevs is seeking damages, which would not be mooted in any event.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fand graduated from the QLLP. In March 2009, he rejoined the general prison population.\n\n       In the relevant pleading, the Third Amended Complaint, Mr. Toevs complained\n\nthat during his placement in the QLLP from 2005 to 2009 he was deprived of a liberty\n\ninterest without due process.2 Specifically, he alleged that Jean Glidewell (his case\n\nmanager from September 2005 to February 2006) and Kristi Moore (his case manager\n\nfrom March to June 2006) denied him his right to a meaningful periodic review of his\n\nconfinement in administrative segregation because the reviews they gave him were\n\nperfunctory, meaningless, and all said the same thing. With regard to Larry Reid (the\n\nwarden at CSP/CCF from September 1, 2002, until October 1, 2007) and Susan Jones\n\n(Mr. Reid’s successor as CSP/CCF warden), he alleged that OM 650-100 rendered any\n\nreviews meaningless because they could not result in his immediate release from the\n\nQLLP. And finally, he complained that OM 650-100 did not provide for reviews when\n\nhe was in QLLP Levels 4 through 6 in February to September 2005 and October 2007 to\n\nJanuary 2009. All of his claims were asserted against defendants in their individual\n\ncapacities. He requested compensatory and punitive damages and declaratory relief.\n\n       The parties consented to have the case heard by a magistrate judge. See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 636(c). In evaluating the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, the district\n\ncourt held defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. It held that the review process\n\n\n2\n        Although Mr. Toevs initially was placed in the QLLP in March 2002, the district\ncourt held that any claims for periods before August 2004 were barred by the applicable\nstatute of limitations. Thus, the Third Amended Complaint focused on events from 2005\nto 2009. Mr. Toevs does not appeal this ruling.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fwas constitutionally adequate, and thus Mr. Toevs had failed to establish that Ms.\n\nGlidewell and Ms. Moore deprived him of a constitutional right. It also held that there\n\nwas no showing of Mr. Reid’s and Ms. Jones’s personal participation in the alleged\n\nconstitutional violations; there was no evidence that they participated in any of the\n\nreviews or that they had any knowledge of his circumstances. Therefore, the court\n\nconcluded that Mr. Toevs failed to establish that Mr. Reid and Ms. Jones deprived him of\n\na constitutional right. The court further determined that the allegations that OM 650-100\n\nmooted any protections provided by AR 600-02 were conclusory. And, the court\n\nconcluded, its decision that the reviews were constitutionally adequate rebutted Mr.\n\nToevs’s argument that, because they could not have secured his immediate release from\n\nthe QLLP, the reviews were meaningless.3 Mr. Toevs appeals.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n       Mr. Toevs argues that the district court failed to give his filings the liberal\n\nconstruction due a pro se litigant. He believes the court missed the focal points of his\n\nargument: (1) that his extended placement in the QLLP violated his right to due process\n\nbecause at Levels 1 through 3 he did not receive any meaningful reviews, which he\n\nexpresses as reviews that could result in his immediate release to the general population;\n\n\n\n3\n       The district court concluded that it need not consider defendants’ argument that\nMr. Toevs had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. It further stated that, if it\nwere to consider the issue, there may be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nthere was an administrative appeal process available to Mr. Toevs. Defendants do not\nargue the lack of administrative exhaustion on appeal, so we do not consider the issue.\n\n                                              -6-\n\fand (2) at Levels 4 through 6 he did not receive any reviews at all. In part, he attributes\n\nthe court’s errors to its denial of his requests for appointed counsel. Without counsel, he\n\nasserts, he was unable to frame his arguments or conduct discovery effectively.\n\n       A.     Standard of Review and Qualified Immunity\n\n       We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. See Steffey v.\n\nOrman, 461 F.3d 1218, 1221 (10th Cir. 2006). Because judgment in this case was based\n\non qualified immunity, however, “the summary judgment standards are subject to a\n\nsomewhat different analysis from other summary judgment rulings.” Id. “The doctrine\n\nof qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions\n\nfrom liability for damages ‘insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\n\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’”\n\nBoles v. Neet, 486 F.3d 1177, 1180 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457\n\nU.S. 800, 818 (1982)).\n\nThus, to avoid judgment for the defendant based on qualified immunity, “the plaintiff\n\nmust show that the defendant’s actions violated a specific statutory or constitutional right,\n\nand that the constitutional or statutory rights the defendant allegedly violated were clearly\n\nestablished at the time of the conduct at issue.” Steffey, 461 F.3d at 1221 (quotation\n\nomitted); Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 129 S. Ct. 808, 815-16 (2009). We view\n\nthe facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Mr. Toevs. See Kirkland v. St. Vrain\n\nValley Sch. Dist. No. Re-1J, 464 F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir. 2006).\n\n       We have discretion to address the two qualified-immunity prongs in whatever\n\n                                             -7-\n\forder is appropriate under the circumstances. Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 818; see also\n\nAshcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2080 (2011). We recognize that “a court can often\n\navoid ruling on the plaintiff’s claim that a particular right exists. If prior case law has not\n\nclearly settled the right, and so given officials fair notice of it, the court can simply\n\ndismiss the claim for monetary damages.” Camreta v. Greene, 131 S. Ct. 2020, 2031\n\n(2011). “And indeed, our usual adjudicatory rules suggest that a court should forbear\n\nresolving this issue.” Id.; see also Kerns v. Bader, 663 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (10th Cir.\n\n2011). But “avoid[ing] avoidance” remains within this court’s discretion. Camreta, 131\n\nS. Ct. at 2031-32; Kerns, 663 F.3d at 1181. This is because “our regular policy of\n\navoidance sometimes does not fit the qualified immunity situation because it threatens to\n\nleave standards of official conduct permanently in limbo.” Camreta, 131 S. Ct. at 2031.\n\n“Qualified immunity thus may frustrate the development of constitutional precedent and\n\nthe promotion of law-abiding behavior.” Id. While “[i]n general, courts should think\n\nhard, and then think hard again, before turning small cases into large ones[,] . . . it\n\nremains true that following the two-step sequence—defining constitutional rights and\n\nonly then conferring immunity—is sometimes beneficial to clarify the legal standards\n\ngoverning public officials.” Id. at 2032.\n\n       This is one of those cases in which it is appropriate for the court to exercise its\n\ndiscretion to avoid avoidance. As shown by Mr. Toevs’s seven-year placement in the\n\n\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\fQLLP, prison officials’ actions here are of a longstanding nature.4 The officials’ conduct\n\nsignificantly affected this prisoner. And as discussed below, the law in this area is ill-\n\ndefined. We undertake this analysis, however, with full recognition that “[w]e must\n\naccord substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators, who\n\nbear a significant responsibility for defining the legitimate goals of a corrections system\n\nand for determining the most appropriate means to accomplish them.” Overton v.\n\nBazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003); see also Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 528, 530\n\n(2006). And as stated earlier, but for the fact that ultimately we do award summary\n\njudgment to the defendants here, we would have remanded to give the defendants a\n\nfurther opportunity to advance a penological justification for their conduct vis-a-vis\n\nMr. Toevs.\n\n       B.     Due Process Claim\n\n              1.     Violation of a Constitutional Right\n\n       Accordingly, we turn first to the question of whether defendants violated a\n\nspecific constitutional right. Mr. Toevs alleges a violation of his right to due process.\n\n                     a.      Existence of a Liberty Interest\n\n       The first issue in the due-process context is whether the plaintiff has established a\n\n\n\n4\n       In briefs related to the rehearing petition, Mr. Toevs noted that he had been placed\nin the QLLP on a previous occasion, and during that placement he also had been given\nreviews (including by one of the defendants in this case) that failed to give him guidance\non how to progress through the program. Thus, it is apparent that officials’ conduct goes\nback even further than the beginning of the QLLP placement at issue here.\n\n                                             -9-\n\fprotected interest (in this case a liberty interest). See Steffey, 461 F.3d at 1221; Kirkland,\n\n464 F.3d at 1189. Subject to the qualifications in Sandin v. Conner discussed below, the\n\nDue Process Clause “itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to\n\nmore adverse conditions of confinement.” Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 221 (2005).\n\nIn the prison context, state regulations can create protected liberty interests, but such\n\ninterests are “generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the\n\nsentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process\n\nClause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the\n\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S.\n\n472, 484 (1995) (citations omitted). The district court “determined that because Mr.\n\nToevs alleged placement in the QLLP for a lengthy period of time without meaningful\n\nperiodic reviews, he may state a claim for atypical and significant restraint deserving due\n\nprocess protections.” Toevs v. Reid, No. 06-cv-01620-CBS-KMT, 2010 WL 4388191, at\n\n*5 (D. Colo. Oct. 28, 2010).\n\n       This case comes to us on summary judgment, and therefore we have to view the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Toevs. He has provided allegations and\n\nevidence that his conditions of confinement largely track those conditions described in\n\nWilkinson, which the Court determined were atypical. 545 U.S. at 214, 223-24. But we\n\nneed not decide whether Mr. Toevs actually has established a liberty interest because, on\n\nappeal, defendants do not challenge the district court’s conclusion that Mr. Toevs\n\nshowed, for purposes of defeating summary judgment, that the conditions of his\n\n                                             -10-\n\fconfinement in the QLLP was an atypical and significant hardship.5 Arguments not\n\nclearly made in a party’s opening brief are deemed waived. See Tran v. Trs. of State\n\nColls. in Colo., 355 F.3d 1263, 1266 (10th Cir. 2004); Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144\n\nF.3d 664, 679 (10th Cir. 1998). This court has not hesitated to apply this waiver rule to\n\nprisoner litigants, see Reedy v. Werholtz, 660 F.3d 1270, 1274-75 (10th Cir. 2011), even\n\nto prisoners who proceed pro se and therefore are entitled to liberal construction of their\n\nfilings, see United States v. Clingman, 288 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir. 2002). It is\n\nappropriate to apply the rule equally to government defendants here, who are represented\n\nby government counsel. Thus, we assume that Mr. Toevs has established a liberty\n\ninterest for purposes of defeating summary judgment against him on that point.6\n\n                     b.    Adequacy of Process Afforded Mr. Toevs\n\n                            1.     Mr. Toevs had a right to meaningful periodic\n                                   review while he was confined to the QLLP.\n\n       The next issue focuses on the process that was afforded to Mr. Toevs. See\n\nWilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224; Kirkland, 464 F.3d at 1189. He does not contest the\n\n5\n       The original panel opinion similarly stated that the defendants failed to challenge\nthe district court’s conclusion of atypical-and-significant conditions, and defendants’\npetition for rehearing does not take issue with this portion of the original opinion.\n6\n       The conditions described by Mr. Toevs, if proven at trial, might or might not\nestablish a liberty interest. Any such determination, however, would require a remand for\nfurther proceedings. Our conclusion that defendants are entitled to judgment on the\n“clearly established” portion of the qualified-immunity test obviates any need to remand\nthis case. But we do not intend that this opinion add anything to the liberty-interest\nanalysis set forth in Wilkinson and Sandin.\n\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fadequacy of the process by which he initially was committed to the QLLP or by which he\n\nwas regressed to Level 1 in September 2005. Therefore, these are not issues in this\n\nappeal. Rather, Mr. Toevs argues only that while he was in the QLLP from 2005 to 2009,\n\nhe was denied his right to a meaningful periodic review of his status.\n\n       The periodic-review requirement stems from Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460\n\n(1983), abrogated in part on other grounds by Sandin, 515 U.S. at 483. In Hewitt, the\n\nSupreme Court stated, “administrative segregation may not be used as a pretext for\n\nindefinite confinement of an inmate. Prison officials must engage in some sort of\n\nperiodic review of the confinement of such inmates.” Id. at 477 n.9. The review need not\n\nbe extensive, as the Court continued:\n\n       This review will not necessarily require that prison officials permit the\n       submission of any additional evidence or statements. The decision whether\n       a prisoner remains a security risk will be based on facts relating to a\n       particular prisoner—which will have been ascertained when determining to\n       confine the inmate to administrative segregation—and on the officials’\n       general knowledge of prison conditions and tensions, which are singularly\n       unsuited for “proof” in any highly structured manner.\n\nId. But the review must be meaningful; it cannot be a sham or a pretext. See id.;\n\nSourbeer v. Robinson, 791 F.2d 1094, 1101 (3d Cir. 1986); McClary v. Coughlin,\n\n87 F. Supp. 2d 205, 214 (W.D.N.Y. 2000).\n\n       Mr. Toevs contends that a meaningful review must be one that can result in his\n\nimmediate release from the QLLP to the general population. In light of the circumstances\n\npresented here, we disagree. The cases to which Mr. Toevs refers to form his definition\n\nof a meaningful review did not involve prisoners who were in stratified incentive\n\n                                           -12-\n\fprograms such as the QLLP. See Mackey v. Dyke, 29 F.3d 1086 (6th Cir. 1994); Kelly v.\n\nBrewer, 525 F.2d 394 (8th Cir. 1975). In those cases, there were only two choices; either\n\nthe prisoner should be in administrative segregation or he should be in the general\n\npopulation. Naturally, then, in that context, the courts referred to a review that was\n\ncapable of releasing the inmate immediately into the general population. But here there\n\nwere six levels within the QLLP, and Mr. Toevs had no right to rejoin the general\n\npopulation before he completed all six levels. Therefore, he did not have a right to an\n\ninterim review capable of prematurely terminating his participation in the QLLP at any\n\ntime before the completion of the sixth level.\n\n       But Mr. Toevs also complained that his progression reviews were perfunctory and\n\nrepetitive, and defendants have countered that their review process was meaningful.\n\nLiberally construed,7 Mr. Toevs’s arguments for a prompt return to the general population\n\nimply and subsume the predicate form of relief that he be given a fair opportunity to\n\nprogress through the program, which could ultimately lead to his return to the general\n\nprison population. Accordingly, it is appropriate for us further to consider the\n\nrequirements for a “meaningful” review in these particular circumstances.8\n\n7\n        Because Mr. Toevs proceeds pro se, he is entitled to a liberal construction of his\nfilings. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972) (per curiam).\n8\n       We are aware that prison officials face myriad difficulties in administering prison\nprograms. Cf. O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 349 (1987) (requiring courts to\nafford prison administrators appropriate deference, as they “are actually charged with and\ntrained in the running of the particular institution under examination” (quotation\nomitted)); Steffey, 461 F.3d at 1222 (“Substantial deference is given to the professional\njudgment of prison administrators because they have ‘significant responsibility for\n\n                                            -13-\n\f       “Unlike punitive segregation, including punitive isolation which is imposed by\n\nway of punishment for past misconduct, administrative segregation is not punitive and it\n\nlooks to the present and the future rather than to the past.” Kelly, 525 F.2d at 399. Thus,\n\na “meaningful” review for a prisoner in a behavior-modification program is one that\n\nevaluates the prisoner’s current circumstances and future prospects, and, considering the\n\nreason(s) for his confinement to the program, determines whether that placement remains\n\nwarranted. In the context of a stratified incentive program such as the QLLP, the review\n\nwould consider whether the prisoner is eligible to move to the next level or, if the\n\nprisoner already is at the highest level, whether he or she is eligible to graduate from the\n\nprogram.\n\n       Further, “what would be required for an intelligent and meaningful review of the\n\ncase of one inmate might not be required in the case of another.” Id. at 400. Where, as\n\nhere, the goal of the placement is solely and exclusively to encourage a prisoner to\n\n\n\n\ndefining the legitimate goals of [the prison] and for determining the most appropriate\nmeans to accomplish them.’” (quoting Overton, 539 U.S. at 132)). As stated, on the\nsummary judgment record before us, this case involves (1) administrative confinement\n(not punitive confinement); (2) for extensive periods of time where the State has\nconceded that confinement was atypical; (3) where the sole justification is behavior\nmodification (not punitive segregation, nor segregation based on safety, prison\nadministration, the nature of the underlying crime, or other objectives); and (4) the\nprisoner is substantially delayed (here, confined for seven years) in progressing through\nthe system without any meaningful review. Thus, contrary to defendants’ arguments for\nrehearing, this opinion does not address situations such as placing an inmate in\nadministrative segregation because his conviction is for raping a child, because he is a\nformer law enforcement officer, or because he has raped or murdered other inmates and\ntherefore presents a risk to the safety of the institution.\n\n                                            -14-\n\fimprove his future behavior, the review should provide a statement of reasons, which will\n\noften serve as a guide for future behavior (i.e., by giving the prisoner some idea of how he\n\nmight progress toward a more favorable placement). See Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 226\n\n(noting that Ohio’s requirement of a statement of reasons “serves as a guide for future\n\nbehavior”); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Corr. Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 15\n\n(1979) (noting that prisoners denied parole were told the reason “as a guide to the inmate\n\nfor his future behavior”).\n\n       In Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976), the Supreme Court instructed\n\nthe lower courts to examine “the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute\n\nprocedural safeguards” and “the fiscal and administrative burdens [on the government]\n\nthat the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.” The value of the\n\nQLLP program is high, in that it promotes the ultimate stated goal of behavior\n\nmodification. Moreover, the administrative burden on the government should be\n\nrelatively low, as the QLLP already requires officials to track prisoners’ progress and\n\nevaluate their prospects for promotion to the next level.\n\n       A meaningful review, however, does not require giving the inmate an opportunity\n\nto submit additional evidence. See Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 477 n.9. And if the relevant\n\ncircumstances truly have not changed, that can easily be stated, rather than just relying on\n\na meaningless, repetitive, and rote response. See Edmonson v. Coughlin, 21 F. Supp. 2d\n\n\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\f242, 253 (W.D.N.Y. 1998).9\n\n       The circumstances of this case are somewhat akin to civil contempt. “In civil\n\ncontempt, the contemnor is able to purge the contempt and obtain his release by\n\ncommitting an affirmative act, and thus carries the keys of his prison in his own pocket.”\n\nLucre Mgm’t Group, LLC v. Schempp Real Estate, LLC (In re Lucre Mgm’t Group, LLC),\n\n365 F.3d 874, 876 (10th Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted). Similarly, the QLLP is intended\n\nto provide the prisoner the incentive to make better choices and earn his eventual release\n\nto the general population, putting the ability to move back into the general population\n\nultimately within the prisoner’s own hands, although of course not until he has completed\n\nthe six steps set out in the QLLP. But to provide an adequate ground for civil contempt, a\n\ncourt order must be specific and definite. See id. at 875; see also Int’l Longshoremen’s\n\nAss’n, Local 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Ass’n, 389 U.S. 64, 76 (1967) (“The\n\nmost fundamental postulates of our legal order forbid the imposition of a penalty for\n\ndisobeying a command that defies comprehension.”). A complete failure to explain the\n\nprisoner’s progress is like issuing a vague or ambiguous contempt order; one supposedly\n\nhas the keys to one’s release, but one has no idea what they are.\n\n       We are neither mandating the implementation of a stratified behavior-modification\n\n\n\n9\n       While the petitions for rehearing were pending in this case, Rezaq v. Nalley, No.\n11-1069, was argued before the court. In Rezaq, the district court held that a prisoner had\nno liberty interest in avoiding placement in the United States Penitentiary Administrative\nMaximum Facility (ADX). This decision expresses no opinion regarding Rezaq and does\nnot address the issue presented for review in that case.\n\n                                           -16-\n\fprogram nor imposing any particular structure on any such program. We simply hold\n\nthat, if a prison system wishes to encourage better behavior by implementing a stratified\n\nincentive program that involves an atypical and significant hardship, it must provide\n\nmeaningful individualized reviews to prisoners to help them progress through the\n\nprogram.\n\n                     2.     Mr. Toevs did not receive meaningful periodic\n                            reviews between 2005 and 2009.\n\n                            A. Levels 1 through 3\n\n       Having determined the requirements for a meaningful periodic review, we must\n\ndetermine whether the reviews given to Mr. Toevs at Levels 1, 2, and 3 starting in 2005\n\nmeet this standard. As Mr. Toevs complains, most of his review forms largely contain the\n\nsame information, with occasional updates. But defendants contend that the review forms\n\nreflect only part of the review process.\n\n       Ms. Moore and Ms. Glidewell submitted affidavits stating that “[a]n inmate’s\n\nperiodic review is recorded on a form prescribed by AR 600-02. The contents of this\n\nform do not reflect all factors considered in the inmate’s review, but only document\n\nsignificant benchmarks in the inmate’s progress through the QLLP.” R. at 607; 649.10\n\n       Inmates’ periodic reviews are initiated by case managers, and consist of a\n       review of information obtained from the case manager’s contacts with the\n       inmate during the review period, a review of Chronlog reports, chrons\n       entered by housing staff, and incident reports, if any. The reviews also\n\n\n10\n      Defendants initially submitted an unsigned affidavit for Ms. Glidewell, but later\nsubmitted a signed version.\n\n                                           -17-\n\f       consider whether the reasons for the inmate’s initial placement in\n       administrative segregation still exist. If the case manager determines from a\n       review that the inmate has met all expectations, he or she recommends a\n       progression to the next level in the QLLP. If not, he or she recommends no\n       change.\n\nId. at 608; see also id. at 650.\n\n       However, the evidence in this record does not indicate that Mr. Toevs received\n\nmeaningful reviews. For example, he spent twenty-one months at Level 3 (eighteen more\n\nthan the minimum) before being promoted to Level 4. The QLLP specifies certain\n\nprerequisites for promotion to Level 4. During this time, however, his review forms\n\nnever stated why he was being held at Level 3. While certain classes were recommended,\n\nthere was no indication that they had to be completed before progression (and in fact,\n\nMr. Toevs was progressed from Level 2 to Level 3 before he completed classes that were\n\nthen being recommended). Accordingly, the reviews at Levels 1 through 3 were not\n\nmeaningful.\n\n                              B.   Levels 4 through 6\n\n       Levels 4, 5, and 6 present an even clearer violation, given defendants’ concession\n\nthat no reviews were conducted at these levels.11 They contend that reviews are not\n\n\n11\n      It appears that Ms. Moore and Ms. Glidewell were no longer Mr. Toevs’s case\nmanagers by the time he was promoted to Level 4. Thus, any claim regarding the lack of\nreview at Levels 4 through 6 implicates only Mr. Reid and Ms. Jones.\n\n      In a related argument, Mr. Reid and Ms. Jones argue that there is no evidence of\nany personal involvement by them in any deprivation of Mr. Toevs’s rights. The\nevidence belies this argument. Mr. Toevs challenges the QLLP, which is established by\nOM 650-100. Mr. Reid signed the copy of OM 650-100 in the appellate record,\n\n                                           -18-\n\fnecessary because these levels are classified as “close custody” rather than\n\n“administrative segregation.” But the evidence of record, including Mr. Toevs’s verified\n\nstatement and defendants’ interrogatory answers would allow a jury to find that the basic\n\nconditions of confinement remain the same for all QLLP levels. Thus, at least for\n\npurposes of the record before us on summary judgment, we see no reason why Levels 4\n\nthrough 6 would be exempt from Hewitt’s prescription of periodic review. And without\n\nany reviews, it is impossible for prisoners to track their progress through the QLLP.\n\nFrom this record, for example, it is impossible to determine when Mr. Toevs moved from\n\nLevel 4 to Level 5 and from Level 5 to Level 6, why he was held at those levels for\n\nhowever long he was held there, and how it was determined that he was eligible to\n\ngraduate from the QLLP. Essentially, then, at Levels 4 through 6 prisoners are being held\n\nindefinitely, without review, in the same basic conditions as Levels 1 through 3, and\n\ndefendants’ only justification is that the custody level has a different name. In these\n\ncircumstances (and given that the defendants have waived any argument about the\n\nexistence of a liberty interest), we have no hesitation in concluding that the failure to give\n\nMr. Toevs any reviews at Levels 4, 5, and 6 violated his right to due process.\n\n\n\n\nindicating that he adopted it. He also was made aware of Mr. Toevs’s circumstances by a\nletter in the summer of 2006. Ms. Jones, as Mr. Reid’s successor, apparently had the\npower to amend OM 650-100 had she chosen. In addition, Ms. Jones signed at least one\nof Mr. Toevs’s review forms.\n\n                                             -19-\n\f                2.   The law was not clearly established.\n\n       Even though Mr. Toevs did not receive meaningful periodic reviews, we conclude\n\nthat defendants are entitled to judgment based on qualified immunity because it was not\n\nclearly established in 2005 through 2009 that the review process was inadequate.\n\n“Despite their participation in . . . constitutionally impermissible conduct, respondents\n\nmay nevertheless be shielded from liability for civil damages if their actions did not\n\nviolate ‘clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\n\nwould have known.’” Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739 (2002) (quoting Harlow, 457\n\nU.S. at 818).\n\n       “Ordinarily, in order for the law to be clearly established, there must be a Supreme\n\nCourt or Tenth Circuit decision on point, or the clearly established weight of authority\n\nfrom other courts must have found the law to be as the plaintiff maintains.” Walker v.\n\nCity of Orem, 451 F.3d 1139, 1151 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted). It is not\n\nnecessary, however, to find cases that are “fundamentally similar” or even “materially\n\nsimilar,” because “officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established\n\nlaw even in novel factual circumstances.” Hope, 536 U.S. at 741. The “salient question .\n\n. . is whether the state of the law [at the time of the actions] gave respondents fair warning\n\nthat their [conduct] was unconstitutional.” Id.\n\n       Since Hewitt, it has been clearly established that prisoners cannot be placed\n\nindefinitely in administrative segregation without receiving meaningful periodic reviews.\n\n459 U.S. at 477 n.9. This court, however, has not previously interpreted “meaningful” to\n\nrequire officials to inform prisoners placed in a stratified behavior-modification program\n\n                                             -20-\n\fof the reasons for their continued placement, so as to provide a guide for future behavior.\n\nMoreover, this court has never considered the due-process implications of the QLLP.\n\nAccordingly, we cannot conclude that the state of the law from 2005 to 2009 gave\n\ndefendants fair warning that the QLLP review process was not meaningful, or that the\n\nlack of reviews at QLLP Levels 4 through 6 was a due-process violation. Because the\n\nlaw was not clearly established, defendants are entitled to judgment based on qualified\n\nimmunity.\n\n       C.     Appointment of Counsel\n\n       “We review a district court’s refusal to appoint counsel for an indigent prisoner in\n\na civil case for an abuse of discretion.” Hill v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 393 F.3d\n\n1111, 1115 (10th Cir. 2004). “Only in those extreme cases where the lack of counsel\n\nresults in fundamental unfairness will the district court’s decision be overturned.” Id.\n\n(quotation omitted). The factors to be considered include “the merits of a prisoner’s\n\nclaims, the nature and complexity of the factual and legal issues, and the prisoner’s ability\n\nto investigate the facts and present his claims.” Id.; see also Rucks v. Boergermann, 57\n\nF.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\n       Mr. Toevs argues that he lost his case at the district court level because he was not\n\nable to frame his arguments effectively and encountered problems in discovery that\n\ncounsel would have been able to surmount. “While we do not quarrel with [his] assertion\n\nthat having counsel appointed would have assisted him in presenting his strongest\n\npossible case,” Rucks, 57 F.3d at 979, we do not conclude that the denial of counsel was\n\nan abuse of discretion. As the district court found, Mr. Toevs capably litigated his case.\n\n                                            -21-\n\fIn fact, we compliment him on filing appellate briefs that clearly articulate his arguments\n\nand ably discuss the applicable precedents.12 Our affirmance based on qualified\n\nimmunity is not due to a poor presentation or an inadequate record, but because the law\n\nwas not clearly established at the time of the events at issue.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       A prison system that holds a prisoner in administrative confinement under\n\nconditions that constitute an atypical and significant hardship for approximately seven\n\nyears, with the sole justification of encouraging the prisoner to modify his behavior, is\n\nrequired under the Due Process Clause to provide the prisoner periodic meaningful\n\nreviews. However, because the standards for meaningful periodic reviews during\n\nextended placement in a stratified incentive program involving confinement to\n\nadministrative segregation were not previously clearly established in this circuit,\n\nsummary judgment for defendants based on qualified immunity is therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n12\n       Also, in a prior related appeal, Mr. Toevs was successful in challenging the district\ncourt’s dismissal of his complaint. See Toevs v. Reid, 267 F. App’x 817 (10th Cir. 2008).\n\n                                             -22-\n\f",

No. 1:06-CV-01620-CBS-KMT)\n\n\nSubmitted on the briefs:*\n\nJanos Toevs, Plaintiff-Appellant, Pro se.\n\nAndrew M. Katarikawe, Senior Assistant Attorney General, Civil Litigation and\nEmployment Law Section, John W. Suthers, Attorney General, Denver, Colorado for\nDefendants-Appellees.\n\n\n\n\n*\n       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this\nappeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered\nsubmitted without oral argument.\n\fBefore MATHESON, McKAY, and EBEL, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nEBEL, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n       Janos Toevs, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment to defendants in his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil-rights suit. Mr. Toevs argues that\n\nthe court erred in granting qualified immunity to defendants on his claim that they denied\n\nhim meaningful periodic reviews during his lengthy confinement in administrative\n\nsegregation. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm, although on\n\ndifferent grounds than the district court.\n\n       The district court concluded that Mr. Toevs failed to demonstrate that defendants\n\nviolated his constitutional rights. We disagree. Based on the record and the arguments\n\nbefore this court, Mr. Toevs was entitled to meaningful periodic reviews during his\n\nplacement in administrative segregation in the Colorado prison system’s Quality of Life\n\nLevel Program (QLLP) because the exclusive justification for keeping Mr. Toevs in\n\nadministrative segregation was to influence him to modify his future behavior. However,\n\nthe record at this state of the proceeding does not establish that Mr. Toevs was given\n\nmeaningful reviews and Mr. Toevs denies receiving any such reviews. If this were the\n\nend of the analysis we would have to conclude that summary judgment for defendants on\n\nthe merits was improper and we would have to remand for further consideration by the\n\ndistrict court of the reviews given to Mr. Toevs, including the penological interests of the\n\nprison in this process. On the merits, it was certainly error to grant summary judgment to\n\n                                             -2-\n\fdefendants on this issue.   Nevertheless, because at the time it was not clearly established\n\nthat the review process should apply throughout each level of the QLLP and that the\n\nperfunctory reviews given to Mr. Toevs at Levels 1-3 and the failure to provide any\n\nreviews whatsoever at Levels 4-6 would not be considered meaningful given the\n\nrehabilitative justification for this segregation program, we conclude that defendants are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, instead of remanding for further\n\nproceedings, we are able to affirm summary judgment for the defendants upon this\n\nalternative ground.\n\n       The administrative segregation placement in this case involves a prisoner in a\n\nColorado stratified incentive program with the sole stated purpose of encouraging him to\n\nimprove his future behavior. Therefore, this case addresses, exclusively, the standards for\n\nperiodic reviews during placement in this program.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       The QLLP is described in Operational Memorandum (OM) 650-100. The\n\nprogram, which is employed at Colorado State Penitentiary (CSP) and Centennial\n\nCorrectional Facility (CCF), is “a stratified quality of life program based on increased\n\nlevels of privileges for demonstrated appropriate offender behavior and program\n\ncompliance.” OM 650-100 § I, R. at 610. The program consists of six levels.1 Level 1\n\n\n1\n        After the panel issued its original opinion in this case, in seeking rehearing\ndefendants suggested that the case was moot because the structure of the QLLP had\nchanged. But it is defendants’ burden to “com[e] forward with the subsequent events”\nthat allegedly have resulted in mootness, Greater Yellowstone Coalition v. Tidwell, 572\n\n                                             -3-\n\fhas the most restrictive conditions, and each successive level offers the inmate more\n\nprivileges.\n\n       Levels 1 through 3 are classified as administrative segregation. Accordingly, they\n\nare subject to the provisions of Administrative Regulation (AR) 600-02, which governs\n\nplacement in administrative segregation. AR 600-02 provides for periodic reviews of\n\nsegregation status. Levels 4 through 6 are classified as close custody. AR 600-02 does\n\nnot cover these levels, and defendants concede that there is no review process applicable\n\nto them. After completing QLLP Level 6, an inmate is eligible to be transferred to the\n\ngeneral prison population. If an inmate spends the minimum amount of time at each\n\nlevel, he will be in the QLLP for thirteen months and seven days. There is no maximum\n\namount of time for placement in the QLLP.\n\n       Mr. Toevs was placed in the QLLP on March 4, 2002, after attempting to escape.\n\nBy September 2005, he had reached Level 6, but due to poor behavior he was regressed to\n\nLevel 1. He again began to progress through the program, achieving Level 1 on October\n\n7, 2005; Level 2 on October 13, 2005; Level 3 in either December 2005 or January 2006;\n\nand Level 4 on October 15, 2007. On January 31, 2009, Mr. Toevs completed Level </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1121 (10th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted), and defendants’ vague suggestions\nof changes to the QLLP fail to carry that burden. Further, it appears that a suggestion of\nmootness made in connection with seeking rehearing may come too late. See Cardinal\nChem. Co. v. Morton Int’l, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112857\"><a href=\"/opinion/112857/cardinal-chemical-co-v-morton-intl-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 (1993) (“If, before the court had decided\nthe case, either party had advised it of a material change in circumstances that entirely\nterminated the party’s controversy, it would have been proper either to dismiss the appeal\nor to vacate the entire judgment of the District Court.” (emphasis added)). Furthermore,\nMr. Toevs is seeking damages, which would not be mooted in any event.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fand graduated from the QLLP. In March 2009, he rejoined the general prison population.\n\n       In the relevant pleading, the Third Amended Complaint, Mr. Toevs complained\n\nthat during his placement in the QLLP from 2005 to 2009 he was deprived of a liberty\n\ninterest without due process.2 Specifically, he alleged that Jean Glidewell (his case\n\nmanager from September 2005 to February 2006) and Kristi Moore (his case manager\n\nfrom March to June 2006) denied him his right to a meaningful periodic review of his\n\nconfinement in administrative segregation because the reviews they gave him were\n\nperfunctory, meaningless, and all said the same thing. With regard to Larry Reid (the\n\nwarden at CSP/CCF from September 1, 2002, until October 1, 2007) and Susan Jones\n\n(Mr. Reid’s successor as CSP/CCF warden), he alleged that OM 650-100 rendered any\n\nreviews meaningless because they could not result in his immediate release from the\n\nQLLP. And finally, he complained that OM 650-100 did not provide for reviews when\n\nhe was in QLLP Levels 4 through 6 in February to September 2005 and October 2007 to\n\nJanuary 2009. All of his claims were asserted against defendants in their individual\n\ncapacities. He requested compensatory and punitive damages and declaratory relief.\n\n       The parties consented to have the case heard by a magistrate judge. See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 636(c). In evaluating the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, the district\n\ncourt held defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. It held that the review process\n\n\n2\n        Although Mr. Toevs initially was placed in the QLLP in March 2002, the district\ncourt held that any claims for periods before August 2004 were barred by the applicable\nstatute of limitations. Thus, the Third Amended Complaint focused on events from 2005\nto 2009. Mr. Toevs does not appeal this ruling.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fwas constitutionally adequate, and thus Mr. Toevs had failed to establish that Ms.\n\nGlidewell and Ms. Moore deprived him of a constitutional right. It also held that there\n\nwas no showing of Mr. Reid’s and Ms. Jones’s personal participation in the alleged\n\nconstitutional violations; there was no evidence that they participated in any of the\n\nreviews or that they had any knowledge of his circumstances. Therefore, the court\n\nconcluded that Mr. Toevs failed to establish that Mr. Reid and Ms. Jones deprived him of\n\na constitutional right. The court further determined that the allegations that OM 650-100\n\nmooted any protections provided by AR 600-02 were conclusory. And, the court\n\nconcluded, its decision that the reviews were constitutionally adequate rebutted Mr.\n\nToevs’s argument that, because they could not have secured his immediate release from\n\nthe QLLP, the reviews were meaningless.3 Mr. Toevs appeals.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n       Mr. Toevs argues that the district court failed to give his filings the liberal\n\nconstruction due a pro se litigant. He believes the court missed the focal points of his\n\nargument: (1) that his extended placement in the QLLP violated his right to due process\n\nbecause at Levels 1 through 3 he did not receive any meaningful reviews, which he\n\nexpresses as reviews that could result in his immediate release to the general population;\n\n\n\n3\n       The district court concluded that it need not consider defendants’ argument that\nMr. Toevs had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. It further stated that, if it\nwere to consider the issue, there may be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nthere was an administrative appeal process available to Mr. Toevs. Defendants do not\nargue the lack of administrative exhaustion on appeal, so we do not consider the issue.\n\n                                              -6-\n\fand (2) at Levels 4 through 6 he did not receive any reviews at all. In part, he attributes\n\nthe court’s errors to its denial of his requests for appointed counsel. Without counsel, he\n\nasserts, he was unable to frame his arguments or conduct discovery effectively.\n\n       A.     Standard of Review and Qualified Immunity\n\n       We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. See Steffey v.\n\nOrman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168061\"><a href=\"/opinion/168061/steffey-v-orman/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1221 (10th Cir. 2006). Because judgment in this case was based\n\non qualified immunity, however, “the summary judgment standards are subject to a\n\nsomewhat different analysis from other summary judgment rulings.” Id. “The doctrine\n\nof qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions\n\nfrom liability for damages ‘insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\n\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’”\n\nBoles v. Neet, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169275\"><a href=\"/opinion/169275/boles-v-neet/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1180 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting Harlow v.

We recognize that “a court can often\n\navoid ruling on the plaintiff’s claim that a particular right exists.

But “avoid[ing] avoidance” remains within this court’s discretion. Camreta, 131\n\nS. Ct. at 2031-32; Kerns, 663 F.3d at 1181. This is because “our regular policy of\n\navoidance sometimes does not fit the qualified immunity situation because it threatens to\n\nleave standards of official conduct permanently in limbo.” Camreta, 131 S. Ct. at 2031.\n\n“Qualified immunity thus may frustrate the development of constitutional precedent and\n\nthe promotion of law-abiding behavior.” Id. While “[i]n general, courts should think\n\nhard, and then think hard again, before turning small cases into large ones[,] . . . it\n\nremains true that following the two-step sequence—defining constitutional rights and\n\nonly then conferring immunity—is sometimes beneficial to clarify the legal standards\n\ngoverning public officials.” Id. at 2032.\n\n       This is one of those cases in which it is appropriate for the court to exercise its\n\ndiscretion to avoid avoidance. As shown by Mr. Toevs’s seven-year placement in the\n\n\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\fQLLP, prison officials’ actions here are of a longstanding nature.4 The officials’ conduct\n\nsignificantly affected this prisoner. And as discussed below, the law in this area is ill-\n\ndefined. We undertake this analysis, however, with full recognition that “[w]e must\n\naccord substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators, who\n\nbear a significant responsibility for defining the legitimate goals of a corrections system\n\nand for determining the most appropriate means to accomplish them.” Overton v.\n\nBazzetta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130150\"><a href=\"/opinion/130150/overton-v-bazzetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132 (2003); see also Beard v.

And as stated earlier, but for the fact that ultimately we do award summary\n\njudgment to the defendants here, we would have remanded to give the defendants a\n\nfurther opportunity to advance a penological justification for their conduct vis-a-vis\n\nMr. Toevs.\n\n       B.     Due Process Claim\n\n              1.     Violation of a Constitutional Right\n\n       Accordingly, we turn first to the question of whether defendants violated a\n\nspecific constitutional right. Mr. Toevs alleges a violation of his right to due process.\n\n                     a.      Existence of a Liberty Interest\n\n       The first issue in the due-process context is whether the plaintiff has established a\n\n\n\n4\n       In briefs related to the rehearing petition, Mr. Toevs noted that he had been placed\nin the QLLP on a previous occasion, and during that placement he also had been given\nreviews (including by one of the defendants in this case) that failed to give him guidance\non how to progress through the program. Thus, it is apparent that officials’ conduct goes\nback even further than the beginning of the QLLP placement at issue here.\n\n                                             -9-\n\fprotected interest (in this case a liberty interest).

But we\n\nneed not decide whether Mr. Toevs actually has established a liberty interest because, on\n\nappeal, defendants do not challenge the district court’s conclusion that Mr. Toevs\n\nshowed, for purposes of defeating summary judgment, that the conditions of his\n\n                                             -10-\n\fconfinement in the QLLP was an atypical and significant hardship.5 Arguments not\n\nclearly made in a party’s opening brief are deemed waived.

It is\n\nappropriate to apply the rule equally to government defendants here, who are represented\n\nby government counsel. Thus, we assume that Mr. Toevs has established a liberty\n\ninterest for purposes of defeating summary judgment against him on that point.6\n\n                     b.    Adequacy of Process Afforded Mr. Toevs\n\n                            1.     Mr. Toevs had a right to meaningful periodic\n                                   review while he was confined to the QLLP.\n\n       The next issue focuses on the process that was afforded to Mr. Toevs. See\n\nWilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224; Kirkland, 464 F.3d at 1189. He does not contest the\n\n5\n       The original panel opinion similarly stated that the defendants failed to challenge\nthe district court’s conclusion of atypical-and-significant conditions, and defendants’\npetition for rehearing does not take issue with this portion of the original opinion.\n6\n       The conditions described by Mr. Toevs, if proven at trial, might or might not\nestablish a liberty interest. Any such determination, however, would require a remand for\nfurther proceedings. Our conclusion that defendants are entitled to judgment on the\n“clearly established” portion of the qualified-immunity test obviates any need to remand\nthis case. But we do not intend that this opinion add anything to the liberty-interest\nanalysis set forth in Wilkinson and Sandin.\n\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fadequacy of the process by which he initially was committed to the QLLP or by which he\n\nwas regressed to Level 1 in September 2005. Therefore, these are not issues in this\n\nappeal. Rather, Mr. Toevs argues only that while he was in the QLLP from 2005 to 2009,\n\nhe was denied his right to a meaningful periodic review of his status.\n\n       The periodic-review requirement stems from Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1983), abrogated in part on other grounds by Sandin, 515 U.S. at 483. In Hewitt, the\n\nSupreme Court stated, “administrative segregation may not be used as a pretext for\n\nindefinite confinement of an inmate. Prison officials must engage in some sort of\n\nperiodic review of the confinement of such inmates.” Id. at 477 n.9. The review need not\n\nbe extensive, as the Court continued:\n\n       This review will not necessarily require that prison officials permit the\n       submission of any additional evidence or statements. The decision whether\n       a prisoner remains a security risk will be based on facts relating to a\n       particular prisoner—which will have been ascertained when determining to\n       confine the inmate to administrative segregation—and on the officials’\n       general knowledge of prison conditions and tensions, which are singularly\n       unsuited for “proof” in any highly structured manner.\n\nId. But the review must be meaningful; it cannot be a sham or a pretext. See id.;\n\nSourbeer v.

In light of the circumstances\n\npresented here, we disagree. The cases to which Mr. Toevs refers to form his definition\n\nof a meaningful review did not involve prisoners who were in stratified incentive\n\n                                           -12-\n\fprograms such as the QLLP.

In those cases, there were only two choices; either\n\nthe prisoner should be in administrative segregation or he should be in the general\n\npopulation. Naturally, then, in that context, the courts referred to a review that was\n\ncapable of releasing the inmate immediately into the general population. But here there\n\nwere six levels within the QLLP, and Mr. Toevs had no right to rejoin the general\n\npopulation before he completed all six levels. Therefore, he did not have a right to an\n\ninterim review capable of prematurely terminating his participation in the QLLP at any\n\ntime before the completion of the sixth level.\n\n       But Mr. Toevs also complained that his progression reviews were perfunctory and\n\nrepetitive, and defendants have countered that their review process was meaningful.\n\nLiberally construed,7 Mr. Toevs’s arguments for a prompt return to the general population\n\nimply and subsume the predicate form of relief that he be given a fair opportunity to\n\nprogress through the program, which could ultimately lead to his return to the general\n\nprison population. Accordingly, it is appropriate for us further to consider the\n\nrequirements for a “meaningful” review in these particular circumstances.8\n\n7\n        Because Mr. Toevs proceeds pro se, he is entitled to a liberal construction of his\nfilings.

Kerner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108432\"><a href=\"/opinion/108432/haines-v-kerner/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520-21 (1972) (per curiam).\n8\n       We are aware that prison officials face myriad difficulties in administering prison\nprograms.

Thus,\n\na “meaningful” review for a prisoner in a behavior-modification program is one that\n\nevaluates the prisoner’s current circumstances and future prospects, and, considering the\n\nreason(s) for his confinement to the program, determines whether that placement remains\n\nwarranted. In the context of a stratified incentive program such as the QLLP, the review\n\nwould consider whether the prisoner is eligible to move to the next level or, if the\n\nprisoner already is at the highest level, whether he or she is eligible to graduate from the\n\nprogram.\n\n       Further, “what would be required for an intelligent and meaningful review of the\n\ncase of one inmate might not be required in the case of another.” Id. at 400. Where, as\n\nhere, the goal of the placement is solely and exclusively to encourage a prisoner to\n\n\n\n\ndefining the legitimate goals of [the prison] and for determining the most appropriate\nmeans to accomplish them.’” (quoting Overton, 539 U.S. at 132)). As stated, on the\nsummary judgment record before us, this case involves (1) administrative confinement\n(not punitive confinement); (2) for extensive periods of time where the State has\nconceded that confinement was atypical; (3) where the sole justification is behavior\nmodification (not punitive segregation, nor segregation based on safety, prison\nadministration, the nature of the underlying crime, or other objectives); and (4) the\nprisoner is substantially delayed (here, confined for seven years) in progressing through\nthe system without any meaningful review. Thus, contrary to defendants’ arguments for\nrehearing, this opinion does not address situations such as placing an inmate in\nadministrative segregation because his conviction is for raping a child, because he is a\nformer law enforcement officer, or because he has raped or murdered other inmates and\ntherefore presents a risk to the safety of the institution.\n\n                                            -14-\n\fimprove his future behavior, the review should provide a statement of reasons, which will\n\noften serve as a guide for future behavior (i.e., by giving the prisoner some idea of how he\n\nmight progress toward a more favorable placement). See Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 226\n\n(noting that Ohio’s requirement of a statement of reasons “serves as a guide for future\n\nbehavior”); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Corr.

Moreover, the administrative burden on the government should be\n\nrelatively low, as the QLLP already requires officials to track prisoners’ progress and\n\nevaluate their prospects for promotion to the next level.\n\n       A meaningful review, however, does not require giving the inmate an opportunity\n\nto submit additional evidence. See Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 477 n.9. And if the relevant\n\ncircumstances truly have not changed, that can easily be stated, rather than just relying on\n\na meaningless, repetitive, and rote response.

Similarly, the QLLP is intended\n\nto provide the prisoner the incentive to make better choices and earn his eventual release\n\nto the general population, putting the ability to move back into the general population\n\nultimately within the prisoner’s own hands, although of course not until he has completed\n\nthe six steps set out in the QLLP. But to provide an adequate ground for civil contempt, a\n\ncourt order must be specific and definite. See id. at 875; see also Int’l Longshoremen’s\n\nAss’n, Local 1291 v.

This decision expresses no opinion regarding Rezaq and does\nnot address the issue presented for review in that case.\n\n                                           -16-\n\fprogram nor imposing any particular structure on any such program. We simply hold\n\nthat, if a prison system wishes to encourage better behavior by implementing a stratified\n\nincentive program that involves an atypical and significant hardship, it must provide\n\nmeaningful individualized reviews to prisoners to help them progress through the\n\nprogram.\n\n                     2.     Mr. Toevs did not receive meaningful periodic\n                            reviews between 2005 and 2009.\n\n                            A. Levels 1 through 3\n\n       Having determined the requirements for a meaningful periodic review, we must\n\ndetermine whether the reviews given to Mr. Toevs at Levels 1, 2, and 3 starting in 2005\n\nmeet this standard. As Mr. Toevs complains, most of his review forms largely contain the\n\nsame information, with occasional updates. But defendants contend that the review forms\n\nreflect only part of the review process.\n\n       Ms. Moore and Ms. Glidewell submitted affidavits stating that “[a]n inmate’s\n\nperiodic review is recorded on a form prescribed by AR 600-02. The contents of this\n\nform do not reflect all factors considered in the inmate’s review, but only document\n\nsignificant benchmarks in the inmate’s progress through the QLLP.” R. at 607; 649.10\n\n       Inmates’ periodic reviews are initiated by case managers, and consist of a\n       review of information obtained from the case manager’s contacts with the\n       inmate during the review period, a review of Chronlog reports, chrons\n       entered by housing staff, and incident reports, if any. The reviews also\n\n\n10\n      Defendants initially submitted an unsigned affidavit for Ms. Glidewell, but later\nsubmitted a signed version.\n\n                                           -17-\n\f       consider whether the reasons for the inmate’s initial placement in\n       administrative segregation still exist. If the case manager determines from a\n       review that the inmate has met all expectations, he or she recommends a\n       progression to the next level in the QLLP. If not, he or she recommends no\n       change.\n\nId. at 608; see also id. at 650.\n\n       However, the evidence in this record does not indicate that Mr. Toevs received\n\nmeaningful reviews. For example, he spent twenty-one months at Level 3 (eighteen more\n\nthan the minimum) before being promoted to Level 4. The QLLP specifies certain\n\nprerequisites for promotion to Level 4. During this time, however, his review forms\n\nnever stated why he was being held at Level 3. While certain classes were recommended,\n\nthere was no indication that they had to be completed before progression (and in fact,\n\nMr. Toevs was progressed from Level 2 to Level 3 before he completed classes that were\n\nthen being recommended). Accordingly, the reviews at Levels 1 through 3 were not\n\nmeaningful.\n\n                              B.   Levels 4 through 6\n\n       Levels 4, 5, and 6 present an even clearer violation, given defendants’ concession\n\nthat no reviews were conducted at these levels.11 They contend that reviews are not\n\n\n11\n      It appears that Ms. Moore and Ms. Glidewell were no longer Mr. Toevs’s case\nmanagers by the time he was promoted to Level 4. Thus, any claim regarding the lack of\nreview at Levels 4 through 6 implicates only Mr. Reid and Ms. Jones.\n\n      In a related argument, Mr. Reid and Ms. Jones argue that there is no evidence of\nany personal involvement by them in any deprivation of Mr. Toevs’s rights. The\nevidence belies this argument. Mr. Toevs challenges the QLLP, which is established by\nOM 650-100. Mr. Reid signed the copy of OM 650-100 in the appellate record,\n\n                                           -18-\n\fnecessary because these levels are classified as “close custody” rather than\n\n“administrative segregation.” But the evidence of record, including Mr. Toevs’s verified\n\nstatement and defendants’ interrogatory answers would allow a jury to find that the basic\n\nconditions of confinement remain the same for all QLLP levels. Thus, at least for\n\npurposes of the record before us on summary judgment, we see no reason why Levels 4\n\nthrough 6 would be exempt from Hewitt’s prescription of periodic review. And without\n\nany reviews, it is impossible for prisoners to track their progress through the QLLP.\n\nFrom this record, for example, it is impossible to determine when Mr. Toevs moved from\n\nLevel 4 to Level 5 and from Level 5 to Level 6, why he was held at those levels for\n\nhowever long he was held there, and how it was determined that he was eligible to\n\ngraduate from the QLLP. Essentially, then, at Levels 4 through 6 prisoners are being held\n\nindefinitely, without review, in the same basic conditions as Levels 1 through 3, and\n\ndefendants’ only justification is that the custody level has a different name. In these\n\ncircumstances (and given that the defendants have waived any argument about the\n\nexistence of a liberty interest), we have no hesitation in concluding that the failure to give\n\nMr. Toevs any reviews at Levels 4, 5, and 6 violated his right to due process.\n\n\n\n\nindicating that he adopted it. He also was made aware of Mr. Toevs’s circumstances by a\nletter in the summer of 2006. Ms. Jones, as Mr. Reid’s successor, apparently had the\npower to amend OM 650-100 had she chosen. In addition, Ms. Jones signed at least one\nof Mr. Toevs’s review forms.\n\n                                             -19-\n\f                2.   The law was not clearly established.\n\n       Even though Mr. Toevs did not receive meaningful periodic reviews, we conclude\n\nthat defendants are entitled to judgment based on qualified immunity because it was not\n\nclearly established in 2005 through 2009 that the review process was inadequate.\n\n“Despite their participation in . . . constitutionally impermissible conduct, respondents\n\nmay nevertheless be shielded from liability for civil damages if their actions did not\n\nviolate ‘clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\n\nwould have known.’” Hope v.

The “salient question .\n\n. . is whether the state of the law [at the time of the actions] gave respondents fair warning\n\nthat their [conduct] was unconstitutional.” Id.\n\n       Since Hewitt, it has been clearly established that prisoners cannot be placed\n\nindefinitely in administrative segregation without receiving meaningful periodic reviews.\n\n459 U.S. at 477 n.9.

SmithKline Beecham Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165387\"><a href=\"/opinion/165387/hill-v-wyeth-pharmaceut/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1115 (10th Cir. 2004). “Only in those extreme cases where the lack of counsel\n\nresults in fundamental unfairness will the district court’s decision be overturned.” Id.\n\n(quotation omitted). The factors to be considered include “the merits of a prisoner’s\n\nclaims, the nature and complexity of the factual and legal issues, and the prisoner’s ability\n\nto investigate the facts and present his claims.” Id.; see also Rucks v. Boergermann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697779\"><a href=\"/opinion/697779/gregory-lee-rucks-v-gary-boergermann/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 979 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\n       Mr. Toevs argues that he lost his case at the district court level because he was not\n\nable to frame his arguments effectively and encountered problems in discovery that\n\ncounsel would have been able to surmount. “While we do not quarrel with [his] assertion\n\nthat having counsel appointed would have assisted him in presenting his strongest\n\npossible case,” Rucks, 57 F.3d at 979, we do not conclude that the denial of counsel was\n\nan abuse of discretion. As the district court found, Mr. Toevs capably litigated his case.\n\n                                            -21-\n\fIn fact, we compliment him on filing appellate briefs that clearly articulate his arguments\n\nand ably discuss the applicable precedents.12 Our affirmance based on qualified\n\nimmunity is not due to a poor presentation or an inadequate record, but because the law\n\nwas not clearly established at the time of the events at issue.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n       A prison system that holds a prisoner in administrative confinement under\n\nconditions that constitute an atypical and significant hardship for approximately seven\n\nyears, with the sole justification of encouraging the prisoner to modify his behavior, is\n\nrequired under the Due Process Clause to provide the prisoner periodic meaningful\n\nreviews. However, because the standards for meaningful periodic reviews during\n\nextended placement in a stratified incentive program involving confinement to\n\nadministrative segregation were not previously clearly established in this circuit,\n\nsummary judgment for defendants based on qualified immunity is therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n12\n       Also, in a prior related appeal, Mr. Toevs was successful in challenging the district\ncourt’s dismissal of his complaint. See Toevs v. Reid, 267 F. App’x 817 (10th Cir. 2008).\n\n                                             -22-\n\f</pre>",
