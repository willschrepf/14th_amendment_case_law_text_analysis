FISK UNIVERSITY\n\n                     Appeal from the Chancery Court for Davidson County\n                       No. 05-2994 III  Ellen Hobbs Lyle, Chancellor\n\n\n\n                      No. M2008-00723-COA-R3-CV - Filed July 14, 2009\n\n\n\nRICHARD H. DINKINS, J., concurring.\n\n\n       I concur in the thorough and well-reasoned opinion authored by Judge Clement and write\nseparately to express considerations I believe should guide the trial court and the parties as they\ndetermine the appropriateness and nature of any cy pres relief.\n\n        As a result of the dismissal of the O’Keeffe Museum and Foundation from this litigation, the\nquestion of whether Fisk has breached the conditions attendant to the gift and, if so, the appropriate\nremedy therefor, is not in issue. Significantly, the record does not show an unwillingness on the part\nof Fisk to display the art or to honor the purpose of the gift and the conditions set forth by Ms.\nO’Keeffe. Rather, Fisk’s dilemma - and the reason it seeks cy pres relief - is based on an inability,\ndue to expense, to maintain and display the collection as originally contemplated by Ms. O’Keeffe\nand President Johnson.\n\n         Alfred Steiglitz, in his will, and Georgia O’Keeffe, by her actions, bestowed this\nextraordinary collection of art on Fisk University in order to make the collection available to\nNashville and the South to promote the study of art. In my view, it is not insignificant that, of the\nsix institutions chosen to house Mr. Steiglitz’s photographs and art work, Fisk was the only\nuniversity and the only institution located in the South designated. In the decades prior to the receipt\nof Ms. O’Keeffe’s generosity, Fisk had gained a reputation as a center of art and music, in addition\nto its academic reputation. Joe M. Richardson, A History of Fisk University, 1865-1946, (The Univ.\nof Alabama Press (1980)). Among the factors giving rise to this reputation was Fisk’s receipt in\n1931 of a collection of 300 pencil sketches and water colors by Cyrus Leroy Baldridge, the renowned\nmurals of Aaron Douglas and the hiring, in 1937, of Aaron Douglas as a member of the faculty at\nFisk. Id., pp. 148-49. According to the allegations of the complaint, Fisk converted what was then\nthe University Gymnasium to house the Steiglitz Collection, thereby establishing the first permanent\n\n\n                                                   1\n\fgallery space at the university. The Van Vechten Gallery opened on November 4, 1949, a few\nmonths following the New York surrogate court’s approval of Ms. O’Keeffe’s petition. Gifts from\nMs. O’Keeffe’s personal collection followed, beginning with the gift of Calla Lillies in December\n1949. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that Ms. O’Keeffe approved of Fisk’s response to the\nimmediate challenge of housing and displaying the Steiglitz collection by its establishment of the\nVan Vechten Gallery and all of her gifts to the university were in recognition of Fisk’s growing\nstatus as a repository of art and culture.\n\n        By the same token, the primary mission of Fisk is education and, as noted previously, it was\nthe only university amongst the donees of Alfred Steiglitz’s artwork. Dr. Charles Johnson became\npresident of Fisk in 1947 and served until his death in 1956. Under his leadership, “Fisk built five\nmajor buildings, continued to develop an outstanding international faculty . . . and [Fisk] moved into\na condition of acceptance for a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the American Association of University\nwomen, and the Association of Schools of Music.” Patrick J. Gilpin and Marybeth Gasman, Charles\nS. Johnson: Leadership Beyond the Veil in the Age of Jim Crow, (State Univ. of N.Y. Press (2003))\np. 225. Not being convinced that desegregation of education would become a reality, Dr. Johnson\ncreated an environment in which the faculty, guest speakers and students were integrated and\n“prominent artists and intellectuals of varying races and nationalities came together to nurture\nstudents and encourage scholarship.” Id. p. 227. In addition to her donation of art to the institution,\nMs. O’Keeffe was among a group of “visiting luminaries,” including Martin Luther King, Jr.,\nLangston Hughes, Carl Van Vechten, W.E.B. DuBois and Paul Roberson, who donated their time\nand intellect as participants in Fisk’s Basic College program, established by Dr. Johnson “in an effort\nto provide equal education within the then segregated society . . .”. Id., p. 230-31.1 Dr. Johnson’s\ntenure was also noted for his support for and expansion of the Fisk Race Relations Institute.2 Id.,\nChs. 13, 14; Richardson, at 141-42. Ms. O’Keeffe’s choice of Fisk to house the collection,\nconsequently, should also be viewed in the context of her recognition, appreciation and support of\nFisk’s primary mission as educational institution, birthed in the aftermath of slavery to educate newly\nfreed slaves, and its efforts to advance into an uncertain future as a liberal arts institution of national\nprominence and stature.\n\n        The question for the court, the Attorney General and Fisk on remand is what “will most\neffectively accomplish its general purposes, free from any specific restriction, limitation or direction\n\n         1\n\n           “President Johnson founded the Basic College on the principle of individual ability and\n         preparation. His goal was to raise the national standard for liberal arts education and to enrich a\n         student’s overall educational process. Further, Johnson aimed to prepare students for graduate\n         study, and to create a nucleus of black intellectual leaders.” Gilpin & Gasman, pp. 230.\n\n         2\n             The role that Fisk played in the early days of the national effort to eradicate de facto segregation was\nmulti-faceted and multi-disciplinary. The Race Relations Institute brought to the South, the Nashville community\nand Fisk campus a wide array of people and organizations seeking to establish not only a new chapter in race\nrelations in America and the world but also “to educate those in a position to make, or at least directly influence,\npublic policy in urban America.” Gilpin & Gasman, p. 176. This is an effort that continues today. See\nwww.fisk.edu/rri.\n\n                                                           2\n\fcontained therein. . . .” N. Y. Est. Powers & Trusts Law § 8-1.1(c). As noted by Judge Clement,\nthere is no indication in her correspondence with Fisk that Ms. O’Keeffe intended to retain a\nreversionary interest in the art; likewise there is no indication that she did not intend for Fisk to have\ncontrol over the artwork, subject only to its adherence to the general purpose of the gifts and the\nconditions imposed relative to its maintenance and display. The financial challenges facing Fisk are\nnot unique and are shared by other educational institutions; there is a significant public interest in\nkeeping and expanding educational opportunities and service even in difficult times. See generally\nwww.uncf.org. The trial court noted $17 million in deferred maintenance and other long-term\nfinancial challenges that Fisk faced at the time of trial as well as Fisk’s recent fund-raising success\nin response to the Mellon challenge grant. I think it is appropriate, as the court and parties consider\nthe question of cy pres relief, that the primary mission of Fisk as an educational institution be\nweighed as well, and that the extent and manner to which the Steiglitz collection may serve to attract\nrevenue or donors to the university is not an impermissible area of inquiry in addition to issues\nrelated to modifying the conditions of maintenance and display of the art in light of the advances in\ntechnology as recognized by the trial court.\n\n\n                                                _________________________________________\n                                                RICHARD H.
