Craig, now alone and unaided by the school board, appeals pro se from the District Court's order enjoining the operation of racially segregated public educational facilities and requiring the immediate implementation of a unitary school system, including compliance with the semi-annual reporting provision of Singleton v.

The School District resisted, arguing that it did not know what the term \"race\" or \"ethnic origin\" contemplated.  It contended that it could not assure that Negro students were not being discriminated against because it did not have a Congressional definition of the term \"Negro.\"  What began as an ingenius quandry soon became disingenuous when HEW offered these definitions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Negro:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>persons considered by themselves, by the school or by the community to be of African or Negro origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Oriental:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>persons considered by themselves, by the school or by the community to be of Asian origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar guidelines were announced for identifying American Indians, Spanish Surnamed Americans and All Others.  Thereupon, the School District blithely filed a Supplemental Report identifying all teachers and students in the District as \"Orientals,\" since they were so \"considered by the school.\"  Therefore, it reasoned, there was no discrimination, since there was only one race in the entire school district (i. e., \"Orientals\") and it could not be found to be in noncompliance with Constitutional standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With no surprise to anyone the District Court summarily rejected this absurdity and to the credit of the School District and the good sense of its members, the Board consented to a decree, avoiding any further embarrassment by urging that contention in this Court.

Justice Douglas's statement in Tijerina v. Henry, 1970, 398 U.S. 922, 90 S.Ct. 1718, 26 L.Ed.2d 86, sufficiently answers that argument-\"One thing is not vague or uncertain, however, and that is that those who discriminate against members of this and other minority groups have little difficulty in isolating the objects of their discrimination.\"  The record indicates that in the past the School District has apparently had no difficulty identifying Negroes for the purposes of segregating them.
