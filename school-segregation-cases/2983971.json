Introduction\n\n      In five issues, Appellant Father appeals from the trial court’s denial of his\n\npetition to modify child support, arguing that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby denying his request to reduce his child support obligation. We reverse and\n\nremand.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\f                      II. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n         As set forth in the December 2005 final decree of divorce, Father is\n\nobligated to pay Mother $6,500 per month in child support for their four children.\n\nIn April 2007, Father filed a petition to modify the parent-child relationship,\n\nseeking to reduce this amount. After hearing evidence pertaining to the parties’\n\nincome and the children’s expenses,2 the trial court set out the following in its\n\norder:\n\n         (a) the monthly net resources of the obligor per month are in excess\n         of $7,500.00 (the income from [Father’s] medical practice in 2008\n         was $476,721.00);\n\n         (b) the monthly net resources of the obligee per month are\n         $3,000.00;\n\n         (c) the percentage applied to the obligor’s net resources for child\n         support by the actual order rendered by the Court is 35%, reducing\n         as each child is emancipated per statute;\n\n         (d) the amount of child support if the percentage guidelines are\n         applied to the portion of the obligor’s net resources that does not\n         exceed the amount provided by section 154.125(a), Texas Family\n         Code, is as follows:\n\n               35% = $2,625.00\n\n               30% = $2,250.00\n\n               25% = $1,875.00\n\n               20% = $1,500.00;\n\n         (e) the specific reasons that the amount of child support per month\n         ordered by the Court varies from the amount stated in Subdivision\n\n         2\n         Specific portions of the relevant testimony are set out below.\n\n                                          2\n\f      (4) are that the children’s proven needs exceed $2,625.00 per\n      month. The Court finds that the basic general needs of the children\n      are $5,810.00 per month. The Court finds that the specific proven\n      needs of the individual children are $1,210.00 per month. The Court\n      finds that the total proven needs of the children are $7,020.00 per\n      month; [and]\n\n            ....\n\n      (g) pursuant to Section 156.126, Texas Family Code, the Court finds\n      that the total proven needs of the children are $7,020.00. The Court\n      finds that the presumptive award of child support is $2,625.00. The\n      Court allocates the award of child support over and above the\n      presumptive award, as follows:\n\n            $3,875.00 to [Father]\n\n            $ 520.00 to [Mother].\n\n      The trial court concluded that because Father’s child support obligation\n\nwas set at $6,500 per month, and because the children’s needs exceeded that\n\namount, it would not change the child support provisions in the divorce decree.\n\nThe trial court also adopted the following pertinent proposed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law:\n\n            2. The amount of child support ordered by the Court is in\n            excess of the amount provided for by the percentage\n            guidelines;\n\n            3. The Court finds that [Father]’s net income is as follows:\n            a. 2005 (year of divorce) – medical practice $460,933.00\n            b. 2008 – medical practice                     $476,721.00;\n\n            4. The amount of net resources available to [Father] per\n            month is in excess of $7,500.00[;]\n\n            5. The amount of net resources available to [Mother] per\n            month is $3,000.00;\n\n\n                                        3\n\f      ....\n\n11. The Court further finds that the amounts of support of\nthe children based upon their needs and best interest of the\nchildren are as follows:\n\n      a.     Basic general needs of the children are $5,810.00\n             per month as follows:\n             Housing                                       $1,200.00\n             Utilities                                       $500.00\n             Food                                            $800.00\n             Medications (Uninsured)                         $100.00\n             Transportation                                $1,000.00\n             Counseling                                       -0.00-\n             Tutoring                                         -0.00-\n             School Lunches                                  $160.00\n             Hair Cuts & Miscellaneous grooming needs $100.00\n             Clothing/cleaning                               $350.00\n             Medical – including optometric (misc.)\n                     not covered by ins., included separately\n             Vacations                                       $500.00\n             Private Schools                                  -0.00-\n             Misc.

Specific needs of the individual children are $1,210.00\n             per month as follows:\n\n             [Child 1]\n                    Sports lessons/camps                   $50.00\n                    Additional sports equipment            $20.00\n                    Additional medical (uninsured)         $50.00\n                    College prep tests/trips              $125.00\n                    Special school expenses                $50.00\n                                                          $295.00\n\n             [Child 2]\n                    Sports lessons/camps                   $50.00\n                    Additional sports equipment            $20.00\n                    Additional medical (uninsured)         $60.00\n                    College prep tests                     $25.00\n                    Special school expenses                $50.00\n                    Car expenses                           $20.00\n                                                          $225.00\n\n                            4\n\f                         [Child 3]\n                                Sports lessons/camps                   $350.00\n                                Sports/cheerleading equip./clothes      $80.00\n                                Optometric needs                        $50.00\n                                Cheerleading expenses                   $40.00\n                                                                       $520.00\n\n                         [Child 4]\n                                Sports lessons/camps                   $120.00\n                                Additional clothes                      $20.00\n                                Special school expenses                 $30.00\n                                                                       $170.00\n\n            c.    Total support needs are $7,020.00 per month.\n\n\n      After setting out the children’s itemized basic general needs and\n\nindividual specific needs, the court made the following conclusions of law\n\nthat Father now challenges:\n\n\n            3. The Court finds that there have been no material and\n            substantial changes since the date of the Order’s rendition in\n            regards to the children or a person affected by the Order\n            which would warrant a reduction of child support.\n\n                  ....\n\n            5. In determining whether application of the guidelines was\n            unjust or inappropriate under the circumstances, the Court\n            considered evidence of all relevant factors, including factors\n            set forth in Section 154.123 of the Texas Family Code.\n\n                  ....\n\n            10. In comparing the needs of the children at the time of\n            rendition of the Order with the needs of the children at the time\n            modification is sought, there have been no material and\n            substantial changes so as to warrant modification of child\n            support.\n\n                                        5\n\f                                 III. Discussion\n\n      Father complains that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused\n\nto reduce his child support obligation by (1) considering evidence of Father’s and\n\nthe children’s lifestyles, contrary to family code section 154.126(a); (2)\n\nconcluding that the children’s proven needs were $7,020 per month; (3) failing to\n\nsegregate portions of the housing, utilities, food, and transportation costs to\n\nMother, her new husband, and her two step-children; (4) finding that there have\n\nbeen no material and substantial changes since the rendition of the divorce\n\ndecree that would warrant a reduction of child support; and (5) ordering him to\n\npay more than 100 percent of the children’s proven needs, in violation of section\n\n154.126(b).\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n      We review a trial court’s refusal to modify child support for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. In re B.S.H., 308 S.W.3d 76, 78 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2009, no\n\npet.); In re P.J.H., 25 S.W.3d 402, 405 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2000, no pet.). If\n\nthere is some probative and substantive evidence to support the judgment, the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion. B.S.H., 308 S.W.3d at 78; P.J.H., 25\n\nS.W.3d at 405. An abuse of discretion does not occur when the trial court bases\n\nits decisions on conflicting evidence. In re Barber, 982 S.W.2d 364, 366 (Tex.\n\n1998) (orig. proceeding).\n\n      A trial court abuses its discretion if it misapplies the law to established\n\nfacts. State v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 526 S.W.2d 526, 528 (Tex. 1975); In re Talco-\n\n                                        6\n\fBogata Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. Bond Election, 994 S.W.2d 343, 347 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 1999, no pet.). Legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\n\nare relevant factors in determining whether the trial court has abused its\n\ndiscretion but are not independent grounds for asserting error. In re A.J.J., No.\n\n02-04-00265-CV, 2005 WL 914493, at *1 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Apr. 21, 2005,\n\nno pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n      The trial court’s findings of fact are reviewable for legal and factual\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support them by the same standards that are\n\napplied in reviewing evidence supporting a jury’s answer. Ortiz v. Jones, 917\n\nS.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex. 1996); Catalina v. Blasdel, 881 S.W.2d 295, 297 (Tex.\n\n1994). We may sustain a legal sufficiency challenge only when (1) the record\n\ndiscloses a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred\n\nby rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to\n\nprove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a\n\nmere scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of a vital\n\nfact. Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Martinez, 977 S.W.2d 328, 334 (Tex. 1998),\n\ncert. denied, 526 U.S. 1040 (1999); Robert W. Calvert, “No Evidence” and\n\n“Insufficient Evidence” Points of Error, 38 Tex. L. Rev. 361, 362–63 (1960). In\n\ndetermining whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support the finding\n\nunder review, we must consider evidence favorable to the finding if a reasonable\n\nfactfinder could and disregard evidence contrary to the finding unless a\n\nreasonable factfinder could not. Cent. Ready Mix Concrete Co. v. Islas, 228\n\n                                         7\n\fS.W.3d 649, 651 (Tex. 2007); City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807, 827\n\n(Tex. 2005).\n\n      When reviewing an assertion that the evidence is factually insufficient to\n\nsupport a finding, we set aside the finding only if, after considering and weighing\n\nall of the evidence in the record pertinent to that finding, we determine that the\n\nevidence supporting the finding is so weak, or so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of all the evidence, that the answer should be set aside and a new trial\n\nordered. Pool v. Ford Motor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex. 1986) (op. on\n\nreh’g); Garza v. Alviar, 395 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex. 1965); In re King’s Estate, 150\n\nTex. 662, 244 S.W.2d 660, 661 (1951).\n\nB. Modification\n\n      A trial court may modify a child support order on a showing that the\n\ncircumstances of a child or a person affected by the order ―have materially and\n\nsubstantially changed‖ since the order was signed.        Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\n\n§ 156.401(a) (Vernon 2008); In re A.J.J., 2005 WL 914493, at *1–2. The party\n\nseeking to modify a child support order has the burden to prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that a material and substantial change in\n\ncircumstances has occurred.     In re Z.B.P., 109 S.W.3d 772, 781 (Tex. App.—\n\nFort Worth 2003, no pet.); Hoffman v. Hoffman, 805 S.W.2d 848, 851 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1991, writ denied). In a modification proceeding, the trial\n\ncourt compares the financial circumstances of the child and the affected parties\n\nat the time the support order was entered with their circumstances at the time the\n\n                                        8\n\fmodification is sought.   Holley v. Holley, 864 S.W.2d 703, 706 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied).\n\n      We initially note that because Father’s petition for modification was filed\n\nbefore September 1, 2007, former section 154.126 governs the child-support-\n\nmodification request in this case. See Act of April 6, 1995, 74th leg., R.S., ch.\n\n20, § 1, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 113, 162–63 (amended 2007) (current version at\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.126 (Vernon 2008)).3 Former section 154.126\n\nprovides:\n\n      (a) If the obligor’s net resources exceed [$6,000 per month], the\n      court shall presumptively apply the percentage guidelines to the [first\n      $6,000 of the obligor’s net resources]. Without further reference to\n      the percentage recommended by these guidelines, the court may\n      order additional amounts of child support as appropriate, depending\n      on the income of the parties and the proven needs of the child.\n\n      (b) The proper calculation of a child support order that exceeds the\n      presumptive amount established for the [first $6,000 of the obligor’s\n      net resources] requires that the entire amount of the presumptive\n      award be subtracted from the proven total needs of the child. After\n      the presumptive award is subtracted, the court shall allocate\n      between the parties the responsibility to meet the additional needs of\n      the child according to the circumstances of the parties. However, in\n      no event may the obligor be required to pay more child support than\n      the greater of the presumptive amount or the amount equal to 100\n      percent of the proven needs of the child.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       The 2007 amendment changed, among other things, the monthly net-\nresource amount from $6,000 to $7,500. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.125\n(Vernon 2008).\n\n                                          9\n\f       Though the parties disagree on Father’s actual income, they do not dispute\n\nthat his income is greater than the $6,000 per month necessary to trigger section\n\n154.126.4    Applying the percentage guidelines to the first $6,000 of Father’s\n\nincome results in presumptive child support amounts below those contained in\n\nthe trial court’s order:\n\nPresumptive Amount                        Trial Court’s Order\n\n35% = $2,100                              $2,625\n\n30% = $1,800                              $2,250\n\n25% = $1,500                              $1,875\n\n20% = $1,200                              $1,500\n\n\n\nSee Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 154.125, 154.126(a) (Vernon 2008).                   The\n\npresumptive child support amounts listed in the trial court’s order were based on\n\nthe revised monthly income level of $7,500 which took effect on September 1,\n\n2007. Father’s petition for modification was filed on April 9, 2007. Thus, the trial\n\ncourt misapplied the law to Father’s income level before reaching its proven\n\nneeds findings.\n\n       Notwithstanding this error, because the trial court determined that the\n\nchildren’s needs had not materially and substantially changed, our next step is to\n\n\n       4\n        Even though Father contends that his income is decreasing, the amount\nhe claims is well above that necessary to trigger the narrow assessment and\nlimited factors of section 154.126.\n\n                                        10\n\fdetermine whether the court abused its discretion by reaching this conclusion.\n\nThis requires comparing the children’s current needs with those at the time of the\n\ndivorce decree. Father’s first, second, and third issues all relate to the court’s\n\ndetermination of the children’s current proven needs.\n\n       1. Consideration of Lifestyle Evidence\n\n       In his first issue, Father challenges the court’s use of factors beyond those\n\nlisted in section 154.126 as indicated in conclusion of law number 5, arguing that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion by considering evidence of Father’s and the\n\nchildren’s lifestyles.\n\n       Section 154.126(a) does not include lifestyle in the two factors it delineates\n\nfor consideration of child support awards above the presumptive amount: (1) the\n\nproven needs of the children, and (2) the income of the parties. Tex. Fam. Code\n\nAnn. § 154.126(a); see also Gray v. Nash, 259 S.W.3d 286, 291 (Tex. App.—\n\nFort Worth 2008, pet. denied) (indicating that every word excluded from a statute\n\nis presumed excluded for a purpose).             In evaluating section 154.126’s\n\npredecessor statute, the supreme court limited consideration of child support\n\nabove the presumptive amount in high-income cases to those factors expressly\n\nlisted in the statute. See Rodriguez v. Rodriguez, 860 S.W.2d 414, 416–17 (Tex.\n\n1993) (construing predecessor statute). Therefore, lifestyle evidence cannot be\n\nconsidered in determining a child support award above the presumptive amount\n\nwhen the obligor’s net monthly resources are greater than $6,000. See id.; Lide\n\nv. Lide, 116 S.W.3d 147, 156 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2003, no pet.); see also In re\n\n                                         11\n\fGonzalez, 993 S.W.2d 147, 159 n.3 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, no pet.)\n\n(holding that section 154.126 narrows the factors to consider in high-income child\n\nsupport cases); Scott v. Younts, 926 S.W.2d 415, 420 (Tex. App.—Corpus\n\nChristi 1996, writ denied) (holding that while the court can consider a wide range\n\nof factors in setting support obligations for obligors earning less than the $6,000\n\nthreshold, the trial court improperly considered factors outside of those narrowly\n\ndefined in section 154.126 for an obligor earning over $6,000 per month); In re\n\nMarriage of Thurmond, 888 S.W.2d 269, 278 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1994, writ\n\ndenied) (reinforcing Rodriguez’s conclusion that ―lifestyle‖ could not be\n\nconsidered when awarding child support beyond the presumptive level in cases\n\nwhere the obligor’s income rose above the statutorily designated income level).\n\n      At the hearing, the trial court overruled Father’s objections to questions\n\nabout how much he spent on travel expenses and allowed Mother to question\n\nhim about his travel habits and trips taken from 2006 to 2008. 5 Father also\n\nobjected to questions on expenditures related to the children. Father’s allegation\n\nthat the expenditures represented the children’s lifestyle, not their needs,\n\nsparked a discussion with the trial court on the factors relevant to its analysis,\n\nwhich concluded with the trial court stating,\n\n      It sounds like you’re saying I cannot take into account his income,\n      what the kids were used to, the lifestyle they were accustomed to; all\n\n      5\n       Mother argued that Father’s expenses were relevant to his complaint that\nhis income was being reduced while he was still living a ―lavish lifestyle, and\nclaiming poverty.‖\n\n                                         12\n\f      I can do is say his definition of needs and it’s got to be less than this\n      amount, and I can’t take into account other factors that might be\n      relevant to their situation in life.\n\n             ....\n\n      I am going to overrule your objection. I’m not going to find that I’m\n      limited purely to your definition of ―needs‖ and that I can’t consider\n      the financial condition of the person paying the child support, nor\n      can I consider the lifestyle to which he helped them become\n      accustomed to prior to the divorce, and that his definition of, quote,\n      needs, is binding upon me. I’m not going to be that restrictive in it.\n\n      So if that’s what you’re telling me I need to do, I’m going to overrule\n      your objection, and I will sure try to follow the law but I don’t interpret\n      the law as you have outlined it with that limitation of his definition of\n      ―needs‖ and that restrictive.\n\nAnd as set out in conclusion of law number 5, the trial court stated that in\n\ndetermining whether application of the guidelines was unjust or inappropriate, it\n\nconsidered evidence of all relevant factors, not just the two listed in section\n\n154.126.    Thus, even if the trial court correctly exercised its discretion by\n\nrejecting Father’s definition of ―need‖ as being overly narrow, the record reflects\n\nthat the trial court erred by considering a factor—lifestyle—beyond those outlined\n\nin family code section 154.126(a). See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.126(a); see\n\nalso Lide, 116 S.W.3d at 156; In re Gonzalez, 993 S.W.2d at 159 n.3; Scott, 926\n\nS.W.2d at 420; In re Marriage of Thurmond, 888 S.W.2d at 278. We sustain\n\nFather’s first issue.\n\n      2. Proven Needs\n\n      In his second and third issues, Father challenges the trial court’s needs\n\nassessment, challenging finding of fact number 11 itemizing the children’s needs\n\n                                          13\n\fand alleging that the trial court erred by including inappropriate items in the\n\nsupported children’s proven needs and by failing to segregate the supported\n\nchildren’s expenses from Mother’s, her new husband’s, and her step-children’s.\n\n            a. Parents’ Testimonies\n\n      Mother testified that she had remarried and that two step-children\n\noccasionally resided with her.    She further testified that none of the current\n\nhousing, utilities, food, or transportation expenses in the divorce decree were\n\nallocated to her herself, her husband, or her step-children; that her current\n\nhusband does not contribute to the mortgage or utility expenses; that the\n\nsupported children’s transportation expenses, originally $1,500 at the time of the\n\ndivorce, now totaled $900 per month; that the cost of vacations had decreased;\n\nand that she would have cable and internet service regardless of the supported\n\nchildren’s presence. She also noted that several expenses present at the time of\n\nthe divorce decree—maid service, counseling, tutoring, and private school\n\ntuition—no longer existed.6      Additionally, she testified that her mortgage\n\npayment, $3,000 at the time of the divorce decree, was now $1,775.7           She\n\n\n      6\n       Mother’s interrogatory responses indicated that tutoring and\nhousekeeping services had ended, but she testified that subsequent to\ndiscovery, some level of tutoring had resumed and that she had since hired a\ncleaning lady.\n      7\n        Mother stated that the $1,775 that she supplied in discovery prior to the\ntrial was not accurate, but she failed to supplement her responses prior to the\nhearing. Mother had apparently moved since the divorce, stating ―There was no\nway I could have stayed in the house I was in and afford it . . . .‖\n\n                                       14\n\foffered conflicting testimony as to what portion of her current mortgage was\n\nattributable to the children, initially testifying that eighty percent was attributable\n\nto the supported children, but subsequently admitting her share of the monthly\n\nhousing expense was $1,000.          Mother also admitted that even though the\n\ndivorce decree’s child-support award included clothing expenses, she required\n\nFather to purchase a separate set of clothing for the children to keep at his house\n\nbecause it was ―too stressful‖ on the children to pack for each visit.8\n\n      In defending the current support level, Mother stated that as the children\n\nhave grown older, their interests and activities have increased their support\n\nneeds.    Mother offered into evidence a written summary of each child’s\n\nextracurricular sports, college preparatory work, academic conference, and\n\nsummer camp activities.       Father disputes that these activities are ―needs.‖\n\nMother and Father both testified to sharing the additional expenses related to the\n\npurchase, maintenance, and registration fees of the two older boys’ cars, as well\n\nas the expenses associated with extraordinary events for all four children such as\n\nsummer camps, conferences, or vacations with friends.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       The monthly clothing allowance at the time of the divorce was $300,\nMother testified that she now spends $500 and that Father ―rarely‖ buys the\nchildren’s clothes. Father disputed this claim, indicating that Mother’s actions\nforced him to purchase a separate set of clothing for each child and that he\nroutinely supplements the children’s wardrobes above and beyond what is\nnecessary to support their visitation with him.\n\n                                          15\n\f            b. Modification Order\n\n      The trial court found the children’s proven needs to be $7,020 per month,\n\nconsisting of monthly ―general needs‖ of $5,810 and ―specific needs‖ of $1,210.\n\nThe trial court’s order contained schedules of the children’s general and specific\n\nneeds, listing ―basic general needs‖ and ―specific individual needs.‖     It listed\n\nbasic general needs as housing, utilities, food, medications (uninsured),\n\ntransportation, counseling, tutoring, school lunches, haircuts and miscellaneous\n\ngrooming needs, clothing, medical (not covered by insurance), vacations, and\n\nprivate schools, totaling $4,710,9 in addition to a category listed as ―Misc.\n\nExpenses‖ for $1,100, for a basic general needs total of $5,810 per month. It\n\nalso listed specific, individual needs for each child, including sports lessons,\n\ncamps, and equipment; college prep; uninsured medical expenses; cheerleading;\n\nand others, amounting to $295, $225, $520, and $170 respectively, and totaling\n\n$1,210 per month.\n\n            c. Mother’s Failure to Segregate Expenses\n\n      Mother admitted that the housing, food, utility, and transportation expenses\n\nshe submitted included those of herself, her new husband, and her step-children.\n\nThe record contains a copy of Mother’s mortgage statement indicating that she\n\npays $1,775 per month for housing. The trial court allocated Mother a portion of\n\nthat amount, $1,200 per month, for the children’s housing. Mother also testified\n\n\n      9\n       Counseling, tutoring, and private schools were each listed as costing $0.\n\n                                       16\n\fthat she spent $1,200 per month on groceries, that her husband purchases\n\nseparate groceries for her step-children, and that she attributes $200 per month\n\nof the grocery bill to herself. The trial court allocated $800 per month towards the\n\nchildren’s food.   Therefore, there is evidence of substantial and probative\n\ncharacter to support the trial court’s order that housing and food expenses are\n\nsegregated in the current support schedule.\n\n      But the trial court failed to require Mother to segregate the children’s\n\nparticularized needs as to transportation and utilities from those of Mother, her\n\nnew husband, and her step-children. See Lide, 116 S.W.3d at 158 (indicating\n\nthat the trial court’s finding was not supported by the record when the requesting\n\nparent failed to segregate, itemize, or explain the particularized needs of the\n\nchildren); see also Nordstrom v. Nordstrom, 965 S.W.2d 575, 579–80 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, pet. denied), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1142 (1999)\n\n(indicating Mother’s conflicting testimony as to whether the child’s portion of\n\nexpenses were segregated from the Mother’s was insufficient to support Mother’s\n\nrequest to increase child support). Thus, the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding Mother the full amount of these items.\n\n            d. Children’s General Needs\n\n      Family code section 154.126 instructs the trial court to consider the parties’\n\nincome and the children’s proven needs when assessing support above the\n\npresumptive level in high-income cases. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.126(a).\n\nThe children’s needs are not limited to ―the bare necessities of life.‖ Rodriguez,\n\n                                        17\n\f860 S.W.2d at 418 n.3. The trial court must determine what the needs are on a\n\ncase-by-case basis by following the ―paramount guiding principle: the best\n\ninterest of the child.‖ Id.; see also Scott, 926 S.W.2d at 420 (indicating that the\n\nchild’s best interest should be the guiding principle for determining the children’s\n\nneeds). Additionally, the children’s needs must be supported by evidence and\n\nmust be explained or itemized. Lide, 116 S.W.3d at 158.\n\n      The record supports the trial court’s removal of the counseling, tutoring,\n\nand private school expenses. The net change in removing or reducing these\n\nitems ($1,012) represents approximately a fifteen-percent decrease from the\n\nsupport amount originally specified in the divorce decree ($6,500).            This\n\nreduction is effectively offset by the $1,100 per month that the trial court\n\nattributed to ―Misc. Expenses.‖     The miscellaneous expense category is not\n\nsupported by any pleading or evidence.         Mother testified to the increased\n\nexpenses associated with the children’s changed needs and interests, but the\n\ntrial court accounted for those expenses when it determined each child’s specific\n\nindividual needs. Even given the trial court’s broad discretion in determining the\n\nchildren’s needs, because there is no record that Mother requested, itemized, or\n\nexplained the    ―Misc. Expenses,‖    the trial court could not have reasonably\n\nconstrued the $1,100 allocated to them as a ―proven need.‖          See Lide, 116\n\nS.W.3d at 158 (indicating that reversal is required when the obligor’s net\n\nresources exceed $6,000 per month and the obligee fails to segregate, itemize,\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\for explain expenses related to the children). Therefore, the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding the ―Misc. Expenses‖ as a proven need.\n\n             e. Children’s Specific Needs\n\n      Father also challenges the items outlined in the children’s specific-needs\n\nschedule, asserting that the expenses represent the children’s interests but do\n\nnot rise to the level of need.    The law does not require expert testimony to\n\ndetermine if a child’s need exists. See Scott, 926 S.W.2d at 421. The trial court,\n\nas sole judge of the credibility of witnesses, may choose whether to believe a\n\nparticular witness. See Fanning v. Fanning, 828 S.W.2d 135, 150 (Tex. App.—\n\nWaco 1992), aff’d in part, rev’d in part and remanded on other grounds, 847\n\nS.W.2d 225 (Tex. 1993). And, even though the ―needs of the child‖ are not so\n\nexpansive as to encompass the most extravagant demands, the court is given\n\nbroad discretion to determine the needs of the child. Scott, 926 S.W.2d at 422.\n\nMother testified about the additional expenses involved with the children’s\n\nincreased interests and activities.      Therefore, because Mother’s testimony\n\nprovides substantive and probative evidence supporting its findings, we cannot\n\nconclude that the trial court abused its discretion by including expenses related to\n\nthe children’s extracurricular, sporting, or interest-related activities in its child-\n\nsupport modification order. See id.; see also In re Pecht, 874 S.W.2d 797, 802\n\n(Tex. App.—Texarkana 1994, no writ) (recognizing that as children age, their\n\ninterests expand and can become more expensive); Hoffman, 805 S.W.2d at 851\n\n(same).\n\n                                         19\n\f      Finally, Father complains that the trialcourt erred by including uninsured\n\nmedical expenses in the children’s specific needs.         Father claims that the\n\nmodification order essentially overrules the divorce decree’s order that the couple\n\nshare these expenses, that the expenses should not be part of the monthly court\n\nordered support, and that the expenses amount to a double recovery by Mother\n\nand the order awards Mother relief for which she did not plead.\n\n      The original divorce decree addressed the children’s uninsured medical\n\nexpenses in a section separate from the one defining the monthly child support\n\nobligation.   Specifically, the divorce decree requires that the parties share\n\nexpenses related to uninsured medical and dental care.10             The children’s\n\n―Specific Needs Schedule‖ incorporated into the trial court’s modified child\n\nsupport order includes uninsured medical expenses for two of the children.\n\n      Because the original divorce decree and the parties’ testimonies reflect\n\nthat the children’s uninsured medical expenses were already being met, the\n\nexpense could not reasonably be considered a proven need of the children as\n\nrequired by family code section 154.126(a).          See Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\n\n§ 154.126(a); see In re J.A.H., 311 S.W.3d 536, 543–44 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\n2009, no pet.) (denying a request to modify child support because the needs of\n\n\n      10\n        Though the original divorce decree outlines six distinct circumstances\nrelated to payment for the children’s uninsured medical and dental care, the\nparties do not dispute that, for the most part, it directs Father to pay seventy-five\npercent of the children’s uninsured medical expenses and fifty percent of the\nchildren’s dental expenses.\n\n                                         20\n\fthe children were already being met). And, as the family code contemplates\n\nsupport above the presumptive amount for the children’s proven needs in high\n\nincome cases, inclusion of these expenses without modification of the original\n\ndivorce decree’s reimbursement clause results in a windfall for Mother by\n\nalleviating her responsibility for these expenses. Therefore, including the\n\nchildren’s uninsured medical expenses was an abuse of the trial court’s\n\ndiscretion.   See id.; cf. Warren v. Warren, No. 13-05-00429-CV, 2008 WL\n\n668213, at *5 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi Mar. 13, 2008, no pet.) (mem. op.)\n\n(holding that the family code contemplates an exact dollar amount based on\n\nproven needs and any award of additional child support above that results in a\n\nwindfall in the form of double recovery).\n\n      For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion when it determined the children’s proven needs, and we sustain\n\nFather’s second and third issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f                                 IV. Conclusion\n\n      Having concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by using an\n\nincorrect income threshold in its analysis and by improperly considering lifestyle\n\nevidence; by requiring duplicative reimbursement for uninsured medical\n\nexpenses; and by failing to require that Mother segregate the expenses\n\nassociated with herself, her new husband, and her step-children in determining\n\nthe proven needs of the supported children, we sustain Father’s first, second,\n\nand third issues.11 We reverse the trial court’s order and remand this case for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    BOB MCCOY\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: LIVINGSTON, C.J.; MCCOY; and MEIER, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: November 24, 2010\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        Based on our disposition of Father’s first, second, and third issues we do\nnot reach Father’s fourth and fifth issues.

Introduction\n\n      In five issues, Appellant Father appeals from the trial court’s denial of his\n\npetition to modify child support, arguing that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby denying his request to reduce his child support obligation. We reverse and\n\nremand.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\f                      II. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n         As set forth in the December 2005 final decree of divorce, Father is\n\nobligated to pay Mother $6,500 per month in child support for their four children.\n\nIn April 2007, Father filed a petition to modify the parent-child relationship,\n\nseeking to reduce this amount. After hearing evidence pertaining to the parties’\n\nincome and the children’s expenses,2 the trial court set out the following in its\n\norder:\n\n         (a) the monthly net resources of the obligor per month are in excess\n         of $7,500.00 (the income from [Father’s] medical practice in 2008\n         was $476,721.00);\n\n         (b) the monthly net resources of the obligee per month are\n         $3,000.00;\n\n         (c) the percentage applied to the obligor’s net resources for child\n         support by the actual order rendered by the Court is 35%, reducing\n         as each child is emancipated per statute;\n\n         (d) the amount of child support if the percentage guidelines are\n         applied to the portion of the obligor’s net resources that does not\n         exceed the amount provided by section 154.125(a), Texas Family\n         Code, is as follows:\n\n               35% = $2,625.00\n\n               30% = $2,250.00\n\n               25% = $1,875.00\n\n               20% = $1,500.00;\n\n         (e) the specific reasons that the amount of child support per month\n         ordered by the Court varies from the amount stated in Subdivision\n\n         2\n         Specific portions of the relevant testimony are set out below.\n\n                                          2\n\f      (4) are that the children’s proven needs exceed $2,625.00 per\n      month. The Court finds that the basic general needs of the children\n      are $5,810.00 per month. The Court finds that the specific proven\n      needs of the individual children are $1,210.00 per month. The Court\n      finds that the total proven needs of the children are $7,020.00 per\n      month; [and]\n\n            ....\n\n      (g) pursuant to Section 156.126, Texas Family Code, the Court finds\n      that the total proven needs of the children are $7,020.00. The Court\n      finds that the presumptive award of child support is $2,625.00. The\n      Court allocates the award of child support over and above the\n      presumptive award, as follows:\n\n            $3,875.00 to [Father]\n\n            $ 520.00 to [Mother].\n\n      The trial court concluded that because Father’s child support obligation\n\nwas set at $6,500 per month, and because the children’s needs exceeded that\n\namount, it would not change the child support provisions in the divorce decree.\n\nThe trial court also adopted the following pertinent proposed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law:\n\n            2. The amount of child support ordered by the Court is in\n            excess of the amount provided for by the percentage\n            guidelines;\n\n            3. The Court finds that [Father]’s net income is as follows:\n            a. 2005 (year of divorce) – medical practice $460,933.00\n            b. 2008 – medical practice                     $476,721.00;\n\n            4. The amount of net resources available to [Father] per\n            month is in excess of $7,500.00[;]\n\n            5. The amount of net resources available to [Mother] per\n            month is $3,000.00;\n\n\n                                        3\n\f      ....\n\n11. The Court further finds that the amounts of support of\nthe children based upon their needs and best interest of the\nchildren are as follows:\n\n      a.     Basic general needs of the children are $5,810.00\n             per month as follows:\n             Housing                                       $1,200.00\n             Utilities                                       $500.00\n             Food                                            $800.00\n             Medications (Uninsured)                         $100.00\n             Transportation                                $1,000.00\n             Counseling                                       -0.00-\n             Tutoring                                         -0.00-\n             School Lunches                                  $160.00\n             Hair Cuts & Miscellaneous grooming needs $100.00\n             Clothing/cleaning                               $350.00\n             Medical – including optometric (misc.)\n                     not covered by ins., included separately\n             Vacations                                       $500.00\n             Private Schools                                  -0.00-\n             Misc.

Specific needs of the individual children are $1,210.00\n             per month as follows:\n\n             [Child 1]\n                    Sports lessons/camps                   $50.00\n                    Additional sports equipment            $20.00\n                    Additional medical (uninsured)         $50.00\n                    College prep tests/trips              $125.00\n                    Special school expenses                $50.00\n                                                          $295.00\n\n             [Child 2]\n                    Sports lessons/camps                   $50.00\n                    Additional sports equipment            $20.00\n                    Additional medical (uninsured)         $60.00\n                    College prep tests                     $25.00\n                    Special school expenses                $50.00\n                    Car expenses                           $20.00\n                                                          $225.00\n\n                            4\n\f                         [Child 3]\n                                Sports lessons/camps                   $350.00\n                                Sports/cheerleading equip./clothes      $80.00\n                                Optometric needs                        $50.00\n                                Cheerleading expenses                   $40.00\n                                                                       $520.00\n\n                         [Child 4]\n                                Sports lessons/camps                   $120.00\n                                Additional clothes                      $20.00\n                                Special school expenses                 $30.00\n                                                                       $170.00\n\n            c.    Total support needs are $7,020.00 per month.\n\n\n      After setting out the children’s itemized basic general needs and\n\nindividual specific needs, the court made the following conclusions of law\n\nthat Father now challenges:\n\n\n            3. The Court finds that there have been no material and\n            substantial changes since the date of the Order’s rendition in\n            regards to the children or a person affected by the Order\n            which would warrant a reduction of child support.\n\n                  ....\n\n            5. In determining whether application of the guidelines was\n            unjust or inappropriate under the circumstances, the Court\n            considered evidence of all relevant factors, including factors\n            set forth in Section 154.123 of the Texas Family Code.\n\n                  ....\n\n            10. In comparing the needs of the children at the time of\n            rendition of the Order with the needs of the children at the time\n            modification is sought, there have been no material and\n            substantial changes so as to warrant modification of child\n            support.\n\n                                        5\n\f                                 III. Discussion\n\n      Father complains that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused\n\nto reduce his child support obligation by (1) considering evidence of Father’s and\n\nthe children’s lifestyles, contrary to family code section 154.126(a); (2)\n\nconcluding that the children’s proven needs were $7,020 per month; (3) failing to\n\nsegregate portions of the housing, utilities, food, and transportation costs to\n\nMother, her new husband, and her two step-children; (4) finding that there have\n\nbeen no material and substantial changes since the rendition of the divorce\n\ndecree that would warrant a reduction of child support; and (5) ordering him to\n\npay more than 100 percent of the children’s proven needs, in violation of section\n\n154.126(b).\n\nA.

App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied).\n\n      We initially note that because Father’s petition for modification was filed\n\nbefore September 1, 2007, former section 154.126 governs the child-support-\n\nmodification request in this case. See Act of April 6, 1995, 74th leg., R.S., ch.\n\n20, § 1, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 113, 162–63 (amended 2007) (current version at\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.126 (Vernon 2008)).3 Former section 154.126\n\nprovides:\n\n      (a) If the obligor’s net resources exceed [$6,000 per month], the\n      court shall presumptively apply the percentage guidelines to the [first\n      $6,000 of the obligor’s net resources]. Without further reference to\n      the percentage recommended by these guidelines, the court may\n      order additional amounts of child support as appropriate, depending\n      on the income of the parties and the proven needs of the child.\n\n      (b) The proper calculation of a child support order that exceeds the\n      presumptive amount established for the [first $6,000 of the obligor’s\n      net resources] requires that the entire amount of the presumptive\n      award be subtracted from the proven total needs of the child. After\n      the presumptive award is subtracted, the court shall allocate\n      between the parties the responsibility to meet the additional needs of\n      the child according to the circumstances of the parties. However, in\n      no event may the obligor be required to pay more child support than\n      the greater of the presumptive amount or the amount equal to 100\n      percent of the proven needs of the child.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       The 2007 amendment changed, among other things, the monthly net-\nresource amount from $6,000 to $7,500. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.125\n(Vernon 2008).\n\n                                          9\n\f       Though the parties disagree on Father’s actual income, they do not dispute\n\nthat his income is greater than the $6,000 per month necessary to trigger section\n\n154.126.4    Applying the percentage guidelines to the first $6,000 of Father’s\n\nincome results in presumptive child support amounts below those contained in\n\nthe trial court’s order:\n\nPresumptive Amount                        Trial Court’s Order\n\n35% = $2,100                              $2,625\n\n30% = $1,800                              $2,250\n\n25% = $1,500                              $1,875\n\n20% = $1,200                              $1,500\n\n\n\nSee Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 154.125, 154.126(a) (Vernon 2008).                   The\n\npresumptive child support amounts listed in the trial court’s order were based on\n\nthe revised monthly income level of $7,500 which took effect on September 1,\n\n2007. Father’s petition for modification was filed on April 9, 2007. Thus, the trial\n\ncourt misapplied the law to Father’s income level before reaching its proven\n\nneeds findings.\n\n       Notwithstanding this error, because the trial court determined that the\n\nchildren’s needs had not materially and substantially changed, our next step is to\n\n\n       4\n        Even though Father contends that his income is decreasing, the amount\nhe claims is well above that necessary to trigger the narrow assessment and\nlimited factors of section 154.126.\n\n                                        10\n\fdetermine whether the court abused its discretion by reaching this conclusion.\n\nThis requires comparing the children’s current needs with those at the time of the\n\ndivorce decree. Father’s first, second, and third issues all relate to the court’s\n\ndetermination of the children’s current proven needs.\n\n       1. Consideration of Lifestyle Evidence\n\n       In his first issue, Father challenges the court’s use of factors beyond those\n\nlisted in section 154.126 as indicated in conclusion of law number 5, arguing that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion by considering evidence of Father’s and the\n\nchildren’s lifestyles.\n\n       Section 154.126(a) does not include lifestyle in the two factors it delineates\n\nfor consideration of child support awards above the presumptive amount: (1) the\n\nproven needs of the children, and (2) the income of the parties.

Father’s allegation\n\nthat the expenditures represented the children’s lifestyle, not their needs,\n\nsparked a discussion with the trial court on the factors relevant to its analysis,\n\nwhich concluded with the trial court stating,\n\n      It sounds like you’re saying I cannot take into account his income,\n      what the kids were used to, the lifestyle they were accustomed to; all\n\n      5\n       Mother argued that Father’s expenses were relevant to his complaint that\nhis income was being reduced while he was still living a ―lavish lifestyle, and\nclaiming poverty.‖\n\n                                         12\n\f      I can do is say his definition of needs and it’s got to be less than this\n      amount, and I can’t take into account other factors that might be\n      relevant to their situation in life.\n\n             ....\n\n      I am going to overrule your objection.

I’m not going to be that restrictive in it.\n\n      So if that’s what you’re telling me I need to do, I’m going to overrule\n      your objection, and I will sure try to follow the law but I don’t interpret\n      the law as you have outlined it with that limitation of his definition of\n      ―needs‖ and that restrictive.\n\nAnd as set out in conclusion of law number 5, the trial court stated that in\n\ndetermining whether application of the guidelines was unjust or inappropriate, it\n\nconsidered evidence of all relevant factors, not just the two listed in section\n\n154.126.    Thus, even if the trial court correctly exercised its discretion by\n\nrejecting Father’s definition of ―need‖ as being overly narrow, the record reflects\n\nthat the trial court erred by considering a factor—lifestyle—beyond those outlined\n\nin family code section 154.126(a).

We sustain\n\nFather’s first issue.\n\n      2. Proven Needs\n\n      In his second and third issues, Father challenges the trial court’s needs\n\nassessment, challenging finding of fact number 11 itemizing the children’s needs\n\n                                          13\n\fand alleging that the trial court erred by including inappropriate items in the\n\nsupported children’s proven needs and by failing to segregate the supported\n\nchildren’s expenses from Mother’s, her new husband’s, and her step-children’s.\n\n            a. Parents’ Testimonies\n\n      Mother testified that she had remarried and that two step-children\n\noccasionally resided with her.    She further testified that none of the current\n\nhousing, utilities, food, or transportation expenses in the divorce decree were\n\nallocated to her herself, her husband, or her step-children; that her current\n\nhusband does not contribute to the mortgage or utility expenses; that the\n\nsupported children’s transportation expenses, originally $1,500 at the time of the\n\ndivorce, now totaled $900 per month; that the cost of vacations had decreased;\n\nand that she would have cable and internet service regardless of the supported\n\nchildren’s presence. She also noted that several expenses present at the time of\n\nthe divorce decree—maid service, counseling, tutoring, and private school\n\ntuition—no longer existed.6      Additionally, she testified that her mortgage\n\npayment, $3,000 at the time of the divorce decree, was now $1,775.7           She\n\n\n      6\n       Mother’s interrogatory responses indicated that tutoring and\nhousekeeping services had ended, but she testified that subsequent to\ndiscovery, some level of tutoring had resumed and that she had since hired a\ncleaning lady.\n      7\n        Mother stated that the $1,775 that she supplied in discovery prior to the\ntrial was not accurate, but she failed to supplement her responses prior to the\nhearing. Mother had apparently moved since the divorce, stating ―There was no\nway I could have stayed in the house I was in and afford it . . . .‖\n\n                                       14\n\foffered conflicting testimony as to what portion of her current mortgage was\n\nattributable to the children, initially testifying that eighty percent was attributable\n\nto the supported children, but subsequently admitting her share of the monthly\n\nhousing expense was $1,000.          Mother also admitted that even though the\n\ndivorce decree’s child-support award included clothing expenses, she required\n\nFather to purchase a separate set of clothing for the children to keep at his house\n\nbecause it was ―too stressful‖ on the children to pack for each visit.8\n\n      In defending the current support level, Mother stated that as the children\n\nhave grown older, their interests and activities have increased their support\n\nneeds.    Mother offered into evidence a written summary of each child’s\n\nextracurricular sports, college preparatory work, academic conference, and\n\nsummer camp activities.       Father disputes that these activities are ―needs.‖\n\nMother and Father both testified to sharing the additional expenses related to the\n\npurchase, maintenance, and registration fees of the two older boys’ cars, as well\n\nas the expenses associated with extraordinary events for all four children such as\n\nsummer camps, conferences, or vacations with friends.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       The monthly clothing allowance at the time of the divorce was $300,\nMother testified that she now spends $500 and that Father ―rarely‖ buys the\nchildren’s clothes. Father disputed this claim, indicating that Mother’s actions\nforced him to purchase a separate set of clothing for each child and that he\nroutinely supplements the children’s wardrobes above and beyond what is\nnecessary to support their visitation with him.\n\n                                          15\n\f            b. Modification Order\n\n      The trial court found the children’s proven needs to be $7,020 per month,\n\nconsisting of monthly ―general needs‖ of $5,810 and ―specific needs‖ of $1,210.\n\nThe trial court’s order contained schedules of the children’s general and specific\n\nneeds, listing ―basic general needs‖ and ―specific individual needs.‖     It listed\n\nbasic general needs as housing, utilities, food, medications (uninsured),\n\ntransportation, counseling, tutoring, school lunches, haircuts and miscellaneous\n\ngrooming needs, clothing, medical (not covered by insurance), vacations, and\n\nprivate schools, totaling $4,710,9 in addition to a category listed as ―Misc.\n\nExpenses‖ for $1,100, for a basic general needs total of $5,810 per month. It\n\nalso listed specific, individual needs for each child, including sports lessons,\n\ncamps, and equipment; college prep; uninsured medical expenses; cheerleading;\n\nand others, amounting to $295, $225, $520, and $170 respectively, and totaling\n\n$1,210 per month.\n\n            c. Mother’s Failure to Segregate Expenses\n\n      Mother admitted that the housing, food, utility, and transportation expenses\n\nshe submitted included those of herself, her new husband, and her step-children.\n\nThe record contains a copy of Mother’s mortgage statement indicating that she\n\npays $1,775 per month for housing. The trial court allocated Mother a portion of\n\nthat amount, $1,200 per month, for the children’s housing. Mother also testified\n\n\n      9\n       Counseling, tutoring, and private schools were each listed as costing $0.\n\n                                       16\n\fthat she spent $1,200 per month on groceries, that her husband purchases\n\nseparate groceries for her step-children, and that she attributes $200 per month\n\nof the grocery bill to herself. The trial court allocated $800 per month towards the\n\nchildren’s food.   Therefore, there is evidence of substantial and probative\n\ncharacter to support the trial court’s order that housing and food expenses are\n\nsegregated in the current support schedule.\n\n      But the trial court failed to require Mother to segregate the children’s\n\nparticularized needs as to transportation and utilities from those of Mother, her\n\nnew husband, and her step-children. See Lide, 116 S.W.3d at 158 (indicating\n\nthat the trial court’s finding was not supported by the record when the requesting\n\nparent failed to segregate, itemize, or explain the particularized needs of the\n\nchildren); see also Nordstrom v. Nordstrom, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1722499\"><a href=\"/opinion/1722499/nordstrom-v-nordstrom/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579–80 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, pet. denied), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999)\n\n(indicating Mother’s conflicting testimony as to whether the child’s portion of\n\nexpenses were segregated from the Mother’s was insufficient to support Mother’s\n\nrequest to increase child support). Thus, the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding Mother the full amount of these items.\n\n            d. Children’s General Needs\n\n      Family code section 154.126 instructs the trial court to consider the parties’\n\nincome and the children’s proven needs when assessing support above the\n\npresumptive level in high-income cases. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.126(a).\n\nThe children’s needs are not limited to ―the bare necessities of life.‖ Rodriguez,\n\n                                        17\n\f860 S.W.2d at 418 n.3. The trial court must determine what the needs are on a\n\ncase-by-case basis by following the ―paramount guiding principle: the best\n\ninterest of the child.‖ Id.; see also Scott, 926 S.W.2d at 420 (indicating that the\n\nchild’s best interest should be the guiding principle for determining the children’s\n\nneeds). Additionally, the children’s needs must be supported by evidence and\n\nmust be explained or itemized. Lide, 116 S.W.3d at 158.\n\n      The record supports the trial court’s removal of the counseling, tutoring,\n\nand private school expenses. The net change in removing or reducing these\n\nitems ($1,012) represents approximately a fifteen-percent decrease from the\n\nsupport amount originally specified in the divorce decree ($6,500).            This\n\nreduction is effectively offset by the $1,100 per month that the trial court\n\nattributed to ―Misc. Expenses.‖     The miscellaneous expense category is not\n\nsupported by any pleading or evidence.         Mother testified to the increased\n\nexpenses associated with the children’s changed needs and interests, but the\n\ntrial court accounted for those expenses when it determined each child’s specific\n\nindividual needs. Even given the trial court’s broad discretion in determining the\n\nchildren’s needs, because there is no record that Mother requested, itemized, or\n\nexplained the    ―Misc. Expenses,‖    the trial court could not have reasonably\n\nconstrued the $1,100 allocated to them as a ―proven need.‖          See Lide, 116\n\nS.W.3d at 158 (indicating that reversal is required when the obligor’s net\n\nresources exceed $6,000 per month and the obligee fails to segregate, itemize,\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\for explain expenses related to the children). Therefore, the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding the ―Misc. Expenses‖ as a proven need.\n\n             e. Children’s Specific Needs\n\n      Father also challenges the items outlined in the children’s specific-needs\n\nschedule, asserting that the expenses represent the children’s interests but do\n\nnot rise to the level of need.    The law does not require expert testimony to\n\ndetermine if a child’s need exists. See Scott, 926 S.W.2d at 421. The trial court,\n\nas sole judge of the credibility of witnesses, may choose whether to believe a\n\nparticular witness. See Fanning v. Fanning, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1779789\"><a href=\"/opinion/1779789/fanning-v-fanning/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 (Tex.

And, even though the ―needs of the child‖ are not so\n\nexpansive as to encompass the most extravagant demands, the court is given\n\nbroad discretion to determine the needs of the child. Scott, 926 S.W.2d at 422.\n\nMother testified about the additional expenses involved with the children’s\n\nincreased interests and activities.      Therefore, because Mother’s testimony\n\nprovides substantive and probative evidence supporting its findings, we cannot\n\nconclude that the trial court abused its discretion by including expenses related to\n\nthe children’s extracurricular, sporting, or interest-related activities in its child-\n\nsupport modification order.

Father claims that the\n\nmodification order essentially overrules the divorce decree’s order that the couple\n\nshare these expenses, that the expenses should not be part of the monthly court\n\nordered support, and that the expenses amount to a double recovery by Mother\n\nand the order awards Mother relief for which she did not plead.\n\n      The original divorce decree addressed the children’s uninsured medical\n\nexpenses in a section separate from the one defining the monthly child support\n\nobligation.   Specifically, the divorce decree requires that the parties share\n\nexpenses related to uninsured medical and dental care.10             The children’s\n\n―Specific Needs Schedule‖ incorporated into the trial court’s modified child\n\nsupport order includes uninsured medical expenses for two of the children.\n\n      Because the original divorce decree and the parties’ testimonies reflect\n\nthat the children’s uninsured medical expenses were already being met, the\n\nexpense could not reasonably be considered a proven need of the children as\n\nrequired by family code section 154.126(a).

(denying a request to modify child support because the needs of\n\n\n      10\n        Though the original divorce decree outlines six distinct circumstances\nrelated to payment for the children’s uninsured medical and dental care, the\nparties do not dispute that, for the most part, it directs Father to pay seventy-five\npercent of the children’s uninsured medical expenses and fifty percent of the\nchildren’s dental expenses.\n\n                                         20\n\fthe children were already being met). And, as the family code contemplates\n\nsupport above the presumptive amount for the children’s proven needs in high\n\nincome cases, inclusion of these expenses without modification of the original\n\ndivorce decree’s reimbursement clause results in a windfall for Mother by\n\nalleviating her responsibility for these expenses. Therefore, including the\n\nchildren’s uninsured medical expenses was an abuse of the trial court’s\n\ndiscretion.   See id.; cf. Warren v.

Conclusion\n\n      Having concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by using an\n\nincorrect income threshold in its analysis and by improperly considering lifestyle\n\nevidence; by requiring duplicative reimbursement for uninsured medical\n\nexpenses; and by failing to require that Mother segregate the expenses\n\nassociated with herself, her new husband, and her step-children in determining\n\nthe proven needs of the supported children, we sustain Father’s first, second,\n\nand third issues.11 We reverse the trial court’s order and remand this case for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    BOB MCCOY\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: LIVINGSTON, C.J.; MCCOY; and MEIER, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: November 24, 2010\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        Based on our disposition of Father’s first, second, and third issues we do\nnot reach Father’s fourth and fifth issues.
