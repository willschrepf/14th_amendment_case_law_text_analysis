GIBSON, Circuit Judges.\n                              _____________\n\nJOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judge.\n\n      After the Supreme Court's decision in Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S.\n70 (1995) (Jenkins III), the State of Missouri filed a motion in this\nlengthy school desegregation case asking the court to declare the Kansas\nCity, Missouri School District unitary, to dissolve all injunctions, and\nto relinquish jurisdiction of the case. Less than a month later, the State\nand the KCMSD entered into an agreement under which the State would pay the\nKCMSD a total of $320 million over three years and be released from any\nfurther obligation in this desegregation litigation. The court held a\nhearing from January 13 through January 31, 1997, receiving testimony from\na large number of witnesses and a considerable volume of documentary\nevidence. On March 25, 1997, the district court1 entered its order denying\nthe motion for unitary status in all respects except extra-curricular\nactivities, but approving the agreement between the State and the KCMSD.\nJenkins v. Missouri, 959 F. Supp. 1151 (W.D. Mo. 1997). The Jenkins Class\nappealed the ruling approving the agreement.2      The State appealed the\ndistrict court's order denying a declaration of unitary status. We affirm\nthe district court's order.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Russell G. Clark, Senior Judge, United States District Court for\nthe Western District of Missouri.\n      2\n        The Jenkins Class moved for a stay of the court's order. We took the motion\nfor stay with the case until we had heard oral argument. Because we have now decided\nthe case, the motion for stay is moot.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f      In discussing the State's motion for unitary status, the district\ncourt first outlined its earlier orders finding that there had been a\nsystem-wide reduction in student achievement in the schools of the KCMSD.\n959 F. Supp. at 1153. It looked to its earlier orders identifying the\npurpose of the public schools as furnishing quality education to their\nstudents and identifying educational achievement as a proper goal in a\ndesegregation remedy. Id. (citing Jenkins v. Missouri, 593 F. Supp. 1485,\n1506 (W.D. Mo. 1984); Jenkins v. Missouri, 639 F. Supp. 19, 24 (W.D. Mo.\n1985), aff'd as modified, 807 F.2d 657 (8th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 484\nU.S. 816 (1987)). The court then briefly reviewed the progress made in the\nKCMSD. 959 F. Supp. at 1156.\n\n      The court determined that the burden of proof was on the State, the\nadjudged constitutional violator, to show that no vestiges of prior\ndiscrimination remained in the KCMSD. Id. at 1156-57. It pointed out that\nonce a court has found an unlawful dual school system, the plaintiffs are\nentitled to a presumption that existing disparities are causally related\nto prior segregation, and the burden of proving otherwise rests on\ndefendants. Id. at 1157 (citing Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 443 U.S.\n526, 537 (1979); Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 211 n.17\n(1973)).    One of the vestiges the court found was an achievement gap\nbetween black and white students in the KCMSD. The State argued that the\nJenkins Class should bear the burden of proving that this student\nachievement disparity was caused by the State's constitutional violation.\nThe court rejected the State's arguments, concluding that the achievement\ngap issue should be governed by the same burden-shifting rules as the other\nfactors, and that the State must prove it did not cause the disparity. Id.\n\n\n      The court analyzed in detail the testimony on this issue, including\nexpert opinions. The court found that a portion of the achievement gap was\nattributable to de jure segregation and that unitary status had not been\nattained in this respect. The court ordered the KCMSD to eliminate that\nportion of the achievement gap within three years. Id. at 1165.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f      The court then turned to an analysis of the Green factors.3 With\nrespect to student assignments or the racial isolation vestige, the court\nrecognized testimony that the KCMSD had realized a high degree of racial\nbalance, but pointed out that the schools lost significant enrollment of\nwhite suburban students in the 1995-96 school year following the Jenkins\nIII decision. Id. at 1166. Moreover, the racial imbalance index showed\nan increase in 1996 for both elementary and secondary schools. Id. The\ncourt looked at testimony that the KCMSD must develop and implement a\nstudent assignment system focusing exclusively on the pupils residing in\nthe district, and that this could be accomplished within a two- to three-\nyear period. Id. The district court concluded that the KCMSD had not yet\nachieved unitary status with regard to the racial isolation vestige, but\nthat within a three-year period it would be possible to assess the effects\nof Jenkins III on minority enrollment. Id. at 1167.\n\n      With respect to faculty and staff assignments, the district court\nrecounted the testimony that the district had maintained a substantial\ndegree of racial balance in faculty assignments. Id. at 1166. However,\nthe court also recognized testimony that, during recent years, while the\nsecondary schools fell within the desired variance level, the elementary\nschools had shown a steady decline in compliance. Id. at 1166. The court\nheld that the steady decline at the elementary school level of a balanced\nfaculty warranted further investigation, and so \"the court [found] that the\nKCMSD has not yet achieved unitary status as to faculty assignments.\" Id.\nat 1168. However, the court also stated that the KCMSD should be able to\nremedy this defect in a period of three years. Id.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         In Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 435 (1968), the Supreme\nCourt stated that school districts were obliged to desegregate all aspects of their school\nsystems, including: student assignments, faculty and staff assignments, transportation,\nfacilities, and extra-curricular activities. Disparities in these five aspects of a school's\noperations are the most important indicia of a segregated school system. See Jenkins\nIII, 515 U.S. at 88.\n\n                                            -7-\n\f      With respect to the facilities of the KCMSD, the court observed that\nthe capital improvements already ordered were almost, but not entirely,\ncompleted. The court held that declaration of unitary status should be\nwithheld until the ordered improvements were completed, which would\ncertainly be accomplished in less than three years. Id. at 1168.\n\n      The court held that transportation was so closely related to the\nracial isolation vestige that it was not advisable to relinquish\njurisdiction over the transportation aspect until the KCMSD was unitary in\nstudent assignments. The court therefore declined to find the State had\ncarried its burden of proof on the transportation vestige. Id.\n\n      As to the State's motion for unitary status regarding extra-\ncurricular activities, the court held that the State has carried its burden\nof proving the KCMSD unitary in this respect. The adverse parties seem to\nagree on this issue. Id. The court rejected the State's argument in all\nother respects.\n      The court then considered whether to approve the agreement between\nthe State and the KCMSD releasing the State from liability upon the payment\nof $314 million (plus an additional $6 million added by the court after the\nagreement was entered). Id. at 1152. The court looked at various figures\nreflecting the spending level in the KCMSD per pupil as compared with the\nother largest school districts in the United States. Id. at 1170. It\nrecited the testimony of Dr. John Murphy that the transition funding\nprovided under the agreement would be sufficient to allow a systematic and\norderly transition period during which the KCMSD could become self-\nsufficient. It looked to Dr. Murphy's testimony that if the agreement were\napproved, the KCMSD would have sufficient funds not only to offer quality\neducation, but to make the curriculum and other reforms necessary to\nimprove student achievement.     Id.  The court also looked at testimony\nconcerning the possibilities of the KCMSD achieving other savings, such\nas reduced transportation expenditures. The fact that much of the capital\nimprovement program had been paid for out of current revenue, rather than\ndebt,\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fcreated a situation in which the district would have to pay little for debt\nservice in future years. Id. at 1171. The court also considered that the\nracial isolation vestige could be rectified in two years, and that many of\nthe goals of the quality education programs had been reached. Id. at 1171-\n72.\n\n      The district court rejected arguments of the Jenkins Class that the\ncourt had no authority or jurisdiction to approve the agreement. Id. at\n1172. The district court concluded that, considering the KCMSD's proximity\nto unitary status, any remaining obligation of the State to the KCMSD\nschool children would be discharged by the payment of the funds provided\nin the agreement. It observed that the State has been responsible for the\nfunding, and not the implementation, of the desegregation programs. The\ncourt therefore modified the joint and several liability finding to make\nthe KCMSD liable individually.       The court decreed that the State's\nobligation shall end and the State will be entitled to an order from the\ncourt dismissing it from the action when it has paid the sums provided for\nin the agreement. Id.\n\n      While the court had released the State from further obligations,\nexcept for the payment of funds, it suggested that Dr. Robert Bartman of\nthe Department of Elementary and Secondary Education of Missouri had the\neducational expertise and familiarity with the history of the KCMSD\ndesegregation effort to provide guidance during the transition period, and\nthat the Department should give approval before decisions are made about\nthe necessary budget cuts. Id. at 1178. This was made as an appeal to the\nDepartment and Dr. Bartman's sense of duty. The court concluded that if\nthe Department and Dr. Bartman declined the court's appeal, then the court\nwould seek the Department's help in finding a special master to oversee the\nKCMSD. Id. at 1179. We are informed that the Department and Dr. Bartman\nhave declined this invitation. The issue, however, remains before the\ndistrict court, and while the district judge presiding over this case for\nmany years has turned over superintendence of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fcase to another judge,4 we are satisfied that the urgency of timely\ndisposition of further supervision over the district will be promptly\nconsidered.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      The State argues that it is entitled to a declaration that the KCMSD\nhas achieved unitary status.     Interestingly, the KCMSD, as well as the\nJenkins Class, defend the district court's holding that the KCMSD is not\nunitary. The threshold issue is whether the State or the Jenkins Class\nbears the burden of proof on this issue.\n\n      Generally, once there has been a finding that a defendant established\nan unlawful dual school system in the past, there is a presumption that\ncurrent disparities are the result of the defendant's unconstitutional\nconduct. See Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 208-09 (1973);\nDayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 537-38 (1979); Freeman v.\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494 (1992); see also United States v. Fordice, 505\nU.S. 717, 744 (1992) (O'Connor, J., concurring).       Only when a school\ndistrict has attained unitary status does the burden of proving disparities\nwere caused by intentional segregation shift back to the plaintiffs. See\nSchool Bd. v. Baliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987); see also\nOliver v. Kalamazoo Bd. of Educ., 640 F.2d 782, 810 (6th Cir. 1980) (error\nin assigning burden of proof to defendants where defendants' liability\nunder earlier decree \"had been satisfied\").5 If, however, a defendant is\njoined after the finding of liability, that defendant is, naturally, not\nsubject to the presumption applied to adjudicated constitutional violators.\nSee United States v. City of Yonkers, 833 F.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n        The Honorable Dean Whipple, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Missouri.\n      5\n        In Kalamazoo Board of Education, 640 F.2d at 808-09, another reason for\nputting the burden of proof on plaintiffs was that they were seeking additional relief,\nwhereas the original decree stated that any party seeking to modify the decree would\nbear the burden of \"justifying changes.\"\n\n                                         -10-\n\fSupp. 214, 220 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (shifting burden to new defendant would be\n\"problematic\").\n\n      The State contends that the general rule of presuming causation\napplies to disparities of the sort mentioned in Green, 391 U.S. at 435, but\nnot to disparities in student achievement. The State contends this\ndistinction is appropriate because the defendants have control over the\nGreen factors, such as student assignment, equality of facilities, and\ntransportation, whereas the defendants do not have control over student\nachievement. The State argues that too many external factors affect student\nachievement to require the State to prove that it did not cause low\nminority achievement.\n\n      This argument is not persuasive.    As the Supreme Court noted in\nJenkins III, the Green factors can also be affected by forces outside the\ndefendants' control:\n\n     Just as demographic changes independent of de jure segregation\n     will affect the racial composition of student assignments, so\n     too will numerous external factors beyond the control of the\n     KCMSD and the State affect minority student achievement.\n\n515 U.S. at 102 (citation omitted). The task of the court in analyzing\neither type of disparity is to determine whether it was caused by\ndefendants' misconduct or by external factors. The burden of proof rules\nare simply the framework for making that inquiry.\n\n      There is, nevertheless, a meaningful distinction between the Green\nfactors and the student achievement factor.     Disparities in the Green\nfactors, such as student assignment, inherently define a dual school\nsystem, which could not exist without such disparities. See Coalition to\nSave Our Children v. State Bd. of Educ., 90 F.3d 752, 776 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(Green factors are per se vestiges of de jure segregation). On the other\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fhand, disparity or impairment in student achievement may or may not be\nfound in a    particular case and may or may not be the result of a\nsegregated or dual system. For this reason, the presumption of causation\nwill only be applied to student achievement disparities if the court has\nalready specifically found that student achievement in the district has\nsuffered as a result of the dual system. Thus, in Coalition to Save Our\nChildren, the district court had not included disparity in student\nachievement as a subject for ancillary (i.e., non-Green) relief in its\nremedial decree. When the defendants later moved for a declaration of\nunitary status, the Third Circuit held that the plaintiffs had the burden\nof proving that disparities in student achievement were vestiges of de jure\nsegregation. Id. at 776-77. Accord City of Yonkers, 833 F. Supp. at 222\nn.3 (no initial finding that segregation caused reduction in student\nachievement; plaintiffs bear burden of showing causation).\n\n      In the early days of this case, the district court specifically found\nimpairment in student achievement in the KCMSD was a result of the dual\nschool system. In 1984 the district court found:\n\n     The Court finds the inferior education indigenous of the state-\n     compelled dual school system has lingering effects in the\n     Kansas City, Missouri School District.\n\n593 F. Supp. at 1492.   Again, in 1985, the District Court found:\n\n           Segregation has caused a system wide reduction in student\n     achievement in the schools of the KCMSD . . . .\n\n     . . . .\n\n     . . . [The] education process has been further \"bogged down\" in\n     the KCMSD by a history of segregated education. Too often, as\n     a result, a higher percentage of black students are among the\n     lower achievers.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f639 F. Supp. at 24, 28. Therefore, the Jenkins Class was entitled to a\npresumption that current deficiencies in student achievement were a\ncontinuation of the vestige already identified. See Baliles, 829 F.2d at\n1311-12 (rejecting argument that presumption of causation only applies to\nGreen factors, not to student achievement). But see People Who Care v.\nRockford Bd. of Educ., No. 89 C 20168, 1996 WL 364802 at *73 n.146 (N.D.\nIll. June 7, 1996) (presumption of causation not applicable to achievement\ndisparity), aff'd in part and rev'd on other grounds, 111 F.3d 528, 537-38\n(7th Cir. 1997)     (in light of lack of evidence about proportion of\nachievement gap caused by defendants, district court erred in ordering\ndefendants to close 50% of gap).\n\n      The State contends that in Jenkins III the Supreme Court held the\ndistrict court's findings of student achievement vestiges in the KCMSD were\ninadequate and therefore ineffective to shift the burden of proof to the\nState.   In fact, the Supreme Court did not      say the district court's\nstudent achievement findings were insufficient to establish liability for\nthe student achievement vestige. To the contrary, the Court specifically\ncontemplated that the reduction in student achievement must be remedied:\n\n     Thus, the proper response by the District Court should have\n     been to eliminate to the extent practicable the vestiges of\n     prior de jure segregation within the KCMSD: a system-wide\n     reduction in student achievement and the existence of 25\n     racially identifiable schools. . . .\n\n\n515 U.S. at 90. As the State points out, the Court observed that the\ndistrict court had never made findings on the severity of the vestige, or\nthe \"incremental effect that segregation has had on minority student\nachievement or the specific goals of the quality education programs.\" Id.\nat 101. The Court made this observation in the context of discussing what\nmeasure of improvement should be required to establish unitariness. In the\nsame paragraph the Court stated: \"Under our precedents, the State and the\nKCMSD are entitled to a rather precise statement of [their] obligations\nunder a desegregation decree.\" Id. (quotation omitted). The Court did not\nquestion the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fexistence of the achievement vestige; instead, it ordered that the district\ncourt clarify the quantum of the student achievement vestige, so that the\nparties could know what mark they and the court were aiming at. But see\nid. at 118 (Thomas, J., concurring) (questioning validity of 1984 finding).\nIn the order we review today, the district court complied faithfully with\nthe Supreme Court's command to quantify the vestige.\n\n      The State also argues that the passage of time since the days of\nstate-mandated segregation makes it inappropriate to presume that current\nconditions resulted from that segregation. Justice Scalia's concurrence\nin Freeman suggested that the passage of time renders the presumption of\ncausation inappropriate. See 503 U.S. at 506 (Scalia, J., concurring)\n(\"[T]he rational basis for the extraordinary presumption of causation\nsimply must dissipate as the de jure system and the school boards who\nproduced it recede further into the past.\"). However, the majority opinion\nin Freeman continued to recognize the presumption. The majority opinion\nacknowledged that the passage of time does have some probative value,\ntending to strengthen a defendant's case that de jure segregation did not\ncause current disparities. The majority stated:\n\n           As the de jure violation becomes more remote in time and\n     these demographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely\n     that a current racial imbalance in a school district is a\n     vestige of the prior de jure system. . . . In light of its\n     finding that the demographic changes in DeKalb County are\n     unrelated to the prior violation, the District Court was\n     correct to entertain the suggestion that DCSS had no duty to\n     achieve system-wide racial balance in the student population.\n\nId. at 496. At the same time, the Freeman majority reiterated: \"The\nschool district bears the burden of showing that any current imbalance is\nnot traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior violation.\" Id. at 494.\nKeyes specifically rejected the idea that the passage of time could cause\nthe burden to shift back to the plaintiffs: \"[C]ertainly plaintiffs in a\nschool desegregation case are not required to prove 'cause' in the sense\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fof 'non-attenuation.'\" 413 U.S. at 211 n.17. Therefore, we conclude that\nthe passage of time6 is an evidentiary consideration, but not a bar to the\nusual burden-shifting rules.\n\n      The State also argues that the presumption of invidious causation\nshould not be applied to the State because the State's obligation has only\nbeen to pay for the remedy, not to implement it.        We deal with this\nargument infra at pages 16-18.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      Jenkins III reiterated the standard for determining whether a school\ndistrict has become unitary:\n            [A]mong the factors which must inform the sound\n            discretion of the court in ordering partial\n            withdrawal are the following:    [1] whether there\n            has been full and satisfactory compliance with the\n            decree in those aspects of the system where\n            supervision is to be withdrawn; [2] whether\n            retention   of judicial control is necessary or\n            practicable to achieve compliance with the decree\n            in other facets of the school system; and [3]\n            whether the school district has demonstrated, to\n            the public and to the parents and students of the\n            once disfavored race, its good-faith commitment to\n            the whole of the court's decree and to those\n            provisions of the\n\n\n\n\n      6\n         The passage of time is often overstated by reference to the time of the de jure\nviolations or the duration of this suit. It is frequently overlooked that the obligation of\nthe KCMSD and the State to eliminate the vestiges of the de jure dual school system\nwas not seriously undertaken until after the affirmance by this court in Jenkins v.\nMissouri, 855 F.2d 1295 (8th Cir. 1988), cert. denied in part, 490 U.S. 1034 (1989),\naff'd in part and rev'd in part, 495 U.S. 33 (1990), of the intradistrict remedies crafted\nby the district court. Thus, it was not until the late 1980's that implementation of the\nremedies was commenced, and it was in the early 1990's that the effort was well under\nway.\n\n                                           -15-\n\f     law and the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial\n     intervention in the first instance. [Freeman v. Pitts,] 503\n     U.S., at 491.\n\n     The ultimate inquiry is whether the [constitutional violator]\n     ha[s] complied in good faith with the desegregation decree\n     since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past\n     discrimination   ha[ve]  been   eliminated   to  the   extent\n     practicable.\n\n515 U.S. at 89 (quotation omitted).\n\n      The Court of Appeals reviews the district court's findings as to the\nexistence of vestiges of segregation under the \"clearly erroneous\"\nstandard. See Lockett v. Board of Educ., 111 F.3d 839, 841-42 (11th Cir.\n1997) (per curiam); Coalition to Save Our Children, 90 F.3d at 760; Flax\nv. Potts, 915 F.2d 155, 157 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n      The difficult issue before the district court and before us in this\nappeal is whether the vestiges of past discrimination have been eliminated\nto the extent practicable. Before we reach this issue, we will briefly\ncomment on whether there has been full and satisfactory compliance with the\ndecree in those aspects where supervision is to be withdrawn, and whether\nthe State has demonstrated to the public, the parents, and the students of\nthe once disfavored race a good faith commitment to the whole of the court\ndecree.\n\n      The Supreme Court observed that the State's role with respect to\nquality education programs has been limited to funding, not implementation,\nof these programs. Jenkins III, 515 U.S. at 101. The district court\nrecognized the Supreme Court's language in its opinion. 959 F. Supp. at\n1172. With the passage of time this has been the nature of the State's\ncompliance. It should be remarked, however, that in the early days of\ncrafting the intra-district remedy, the Jenkins Class, the KCMSD, and the\nState were called upon to submit proposed remedial plans, and did so. The\nearly orders of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthe district court accepted the plans put forth by the Jenkins Class and\nthe KCMSD, and rejected the State's proposals as inadequate. See, e.g.,\nJenkins v. Missouri, 672 F. Supp. 400, 404 (W.D. Mo. 1987), aff'd in\nrelevant part, 855 F.2d 1295 (8th Cir. 1988), cert. denied in relevant\npart, 490 U.S. 1034 (1989). Perhaps this established a pattern of either\nthe Jenkins Class or the KCMSD assuming responsibility for proposing\nremedial measures, and the State relying upon legal objections to the plan\nand ultimately ceasing any effort to make a contribution toward directing\nor administering the aspects of the remedy. The State had an opportunity\nto help shape the remedy, and perhaps the long history of this litigation\nwould have been different had it accepted the challenge to do more than pay\nwhen ordered to do so. Nevertheless, this pattern having been established,\nthe State has undoubtedly complied with the decrees of the district court\nby funding the programs that have been ordered.\n\n      The State places great emphasis on the amount of money that has been\nspent in Kansas City. It must be remembered in looking back on the long\nhistory of this case, however, that the district court found and this\ncourt affirmed findings that the physical plant of the KCMSD had literally\nrotted; that the inferior education indigenous of the state-compelled dual\nschool system has lingering effects in the Kansas City, Missouri School\nDistrict; that the general attitude of inferiority among blacks produces\nlow achievement which ultimately limits employment opportunities and causes\npoverty; and finally, that segregation has caused a system-wide reduction\nin student achievement in the schools of       the KCMSD.   See Jenkins v.\nMissouri, 855 F.2d at 1300 (citing district court decisions at 593 F. Supp.\nat 1492, 639 F. Supp. at 24, and 672 F. Supp. at 411).\n\n      Restoration of   the physical facilities has had a total cost of\napproximately $500 million, with funds contributed roughly equally by the\nState and the KCMSD. With respect to educational and other programs, the\nState has spent approximately $950 million, and the KCMSD has spent about\n$350 million.    The extensive constitutional violations have required\nextensive expenditures.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f      Suffice it to say that we are left with some question in our minds\nas to whether the State has demonstrated a \"good-faith commitment to the\nwhole of the court's decree and to those provisions of the law and the\nConstitution that were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first\ninstance.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491. Justice Souter, in his dissent in\nJenkins III, questioned the State's commitment to complying with the\ndistrict court's decree. He quoted the district court's statement that\n\"during the course of this lawsuit the Court has not been informed of one\naffirmative act voluntarily taken by the Executive Department of the State\nof Missouri or the Missouri General Assembly to aid a school district that\nis involved in a desegregation program.\" 515 U.S. at 152 (Souter, J.,\ndissenting) (quoting District Court's Order of Nov. 12, 1986, slip op. at\n7). Justice Souter also quoted the following statement of the district\ncourt:    \"The State, also a constitutional violator, has historically\nopposed the implementation of any program offered to desegregate the KCMSD.\n. . . [T]he State has never offered the Court a viable, even tenable,\nalternative and has been extremely antagonistic in its approach to\neffecting the desegregation of the KCMSD.\" Id. (quoting District Court's\nOrder of April 16, 1993, slip op. at 2).       In view of our analysis of\nwhether the vestiges of segregation have been remedied to the extent\npracticable, we need not further examine this issue.\n\n                                   III.\n\n      We now turn to the issue that the Supreme Court stated was the basic\ntask of the district court, namely deciding whether reduction in\nachievement by minority students attributable to prior de jure segregation\nhas been remedied to the extent practicable.    In Jenkins III the Supreme\nCourt said:\n\n     Under our precedents, the State and the KCMSD are \"entitled to\n     a rather precise statement of [their] obligations under a\n     desegregation decree.\" [Freeman, 498 U.S.] at 246. Although\n     the District Court has determined that \"[s]egregation has\n     caused a system wide reduction in achievement in\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f     the schools of the KCMSD,\" 639 F. Supp., at 24, it never has\n     identified the incremental effect that segregation has had on\n     minority student achievement or the specific goals of the\n     quality education programs.\n\n515 U.S. at 101.\n\n      In the order now before us, the district court directed its attention\nto identifying the incremental effect that segregation has had on minority\nstudent achievement, and also to specifying the goals of the quality\neducational programs. It should first be said that the district court in\nits order of September 17, 1984, pointed to evidence in the record before\nit in stating:\n\n     The general attitude of inferiority among blacks produces low\n     achievement which ultimately limits employment opportunities\n     and causes poverty. . . . The District stipulated that as of\n     1977 they had not eliminated all the vestiges of the prior dual\n     system. The Court finds the inferior education indigenous of\n     the state-compelled dual school system has lingering effects in\n     the Kansas City, Missouri School District.\n\n593 F. Supp. at 1492 (citations omitted).\n\n      The court pointed out further that various plans adopted by the KCMSD\nin an effort to reduce minority isolation had not been effective. The\ncourt stated:\n\n     During the 1983-84 year, no school had less than 30% black\n     enrollment; 24 schools however are racially isolated with 90 +\n     % black enrollment. The Court finds the District did not and\n     has not entirely dismantled the dual school system. Vestiges\n     of that dual system still remain.\n\nId. at 1493 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f      The court also stated that because most of the schools were in\nracially segregated neighborhoods before 1954, the adoption of the\nneighborhood school concept did not substantially change the segregated\nschool system. Id. Optional attendance zones adopted after Brown v. Board\nof Education, 349 U.S. 294 (1955), did not aid the district's integration,\nbut on the contrary allowed segregated attendance patterns to continue.\n593 F. Supp. at 1494.\n\n      There is a significant relationship between the testimony the court\npointed to in 1984 and the testimony presented at the hearing in January\n1997 by the expert witnesses.\n\n      The State's expert witness, Dr. David Armor, testified that in\nanalyzing test scores of black and white students in the KCMSD, using a\nbell curve with a median score of 50 normalized curve equivalent (NCEs),\nwhites scored about ten NCEs higher than blacks. Armor testified that\n\"most, if not virtually all\" of this achievement gap in the Kansas City,\nMissouri School District was the result of socio-economic conditions.\nHowever, Dr. Armor could only identify socio-economic conditions accounting\nfor about two-thirds of the gap; the other third remained unexplained. 959\nF. Supp. at 1163.\n\n      On the other hand, the expert produced by the KCMSD, Dr. William\nTrent, testified that after controlling for poverty, family background, and\nother factors, there was still a \"race effect\" that could be due to past\nsegregation. Id. at 1158. The gap existed in 1986 and 1988, continues to\nexist now, and has never been eliminated. Dr. Trent concluded that about\n4% to 9% of the achievement gap was explained by race. Id. Significantly,\nthe State's expert, Dr. Armor, testified that the size of the achievement\ngap grows larger the longer the children remain in school. Id. at 1159.\nMoreover, Dr. Trent testified that teachers' low expectations of\nachievement in schools with high percentages of minority students also\ncontribute to the achievement gap. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f      After setting out the substance of the testimony of these expert\nwitnesses, the district court pointed out that the State's reliance on\nsocio-economic factors was inadequate to explain about 35% of the gap, even\ntaking the State's expert at his word. Id. at 1163. The court found that\nDr. Trent's analysis showing a \"race effect\" explaining 4-9% of the gap was\n\"reliable and accurately identifies the incremental portion attributable\nto the prior de jure discrimination.\"      Id.   The court found that the\nteacher expectation variable explains 2-4% of the gap, id., and that the\nteachers' lower expectations were a result of earlier de jure segregation.\nId. at 1164. The court took the high end of these ranges in reaching the\nfigure of 13%. The court also held that the increase in the gap as the\nchildren progressed through the KCMSD could also be attributed to\ndiscrimination, id. at 1165, and this, together with the gap when the\nstudents entered school, was 26% of the achievement gap.         The court\nconcluded that these figures translated into a mandate to the school\ndistrict to reduce the achievement gap by 2.6 NCEs. The court ordered that\nthis task was to be completed within three years. It concluded that KCMSD\nhas not currently attained unitary status regarding the quality of\neducation. Id.\n\n      It is evident that the district court rejected Dr. Armor's opinion\nthat socio-economic factors alone were the cause of the achievement gap in\nthe KCMSD. We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in making\nthis finding. The burden of proof was on the State to prove that it had\nnot caused the gap, and the State's expert could not explain a third of the\nachievement gap by his socio-economic theory. The State simply failed to\ncarry its burden, and our discussion could end at this point. But in\naddition, the district court accepted Dr. Trent's explanation quantifying\nthat part of the achievement gap resulting from race; that was a finding\nof fact based upon research by a well-qualified expert.7       Dr. Trent's\ntestimony provided a rational explanation for\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        The State briefly suggests that Dr. Trent's testimony did not \"rise to the level of\nevidence\" contemplated by Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S.\n579 (1993). The State does not cite any reference to the record at which it objected\nto the evidence under Daubert. We therefore understand the State's argument to be a\nsubstantive argument about sufficiency of the evidence, rather than an evidentiary\nobjection.\n\n                                           -21-\n\fthe achievement gap and the extent of it, and we cannot conclude that the\ndistrict court erred in so finding.8\n\n                                         IV.\n\n      The State attacks the district court's denial of unitariness status\nas to four of the five Green factors--student assignments, faculty and\nstaff assignments, transportation, and facilities.\n\n      The KCMSD contended that the current racial balance within its\nschools was unknown because of the effect of the withdrawal of suburban\nstudents after Jenkins III. The district court observed that the student\nassignment aspect of the remedy in this case had depended primarily on\nvoluntary transfers from the suburbs in conjunction with magnet schools,\nrather than on mandatory reassignment. Id. at 1166. After Jenkins III,\nmany suburban students left the KCMSD. The district court found that the\n\"ramifications of the withdrawal of the 1476 white students cannot be\njudged at this time.\" Id. at 1167. The court declined to declare the\nKCMSD unitary in this regard until the effects of this change in the\nenrollment could be ascertained. Therefore, the State failed to carry its\nburden of proof that there was no student assignment vestige. The State\ncontends that, whatever the student assignment statistics, the KCMSD is not\ncurrently engaging in discriminatory student assignment practices, and\ntherefore there should be no vestige under Pasadena City Board of Education\nv. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424 (1976).\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       The expert testimony was responsive to the Supreme Court's direction to\nquantify the achievement gap. It was the only testimony to address this issue, and came\nfrom all parties.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f      Under Spangler and Freeman, school districts that have once\neliminated the student assignment vestige are not required to readjust\nstudent assignments to compensate for subsequent imbalances caused by\nforces other than intentional segregation. \"Once the racial imbalance due\nto the de jure violation has been remedied, the school district is under\nno duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors.\"\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 494. The key distinction between this case, on the\none hand, and Spangler and Freeman, on the other, is that there is no\nfinding in this case that the KCMSD ever eliminated the student assignment\nvestige. The district court's strategy for eliminating this vestige was\nthe magnet school program, rather than the sort of unilateral reassignment\ndecree used in Spangler. See 427 U.S. at 435-36. This strategy was at\nleast partly aborted by the Jenkins III ruling, and the district court\nfound that, on the present state of the record, it was impossible to assess\nthe racial balance in the schools during the process of dismantling the\noriginal remedy. This finding was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the\nState's invocation of Spangler and Freeman on this point is premature. See\nVaughns v. Board of Educ., 758 F.2d 983, 988 (4th Cir. 1985) (\"Until a\nunitary system is created, a school system is not absolved from this duty\nby reason of demographic changes.\"); Haycraft v. Board of Educ., 560 F.2d\n755, 756 (6th Cir. 1977) (Spangler not relevant where segregation has never\nbeen remedied).\n\n      The district court found that the transportation factor was so\nclosely bound to student assignment that the uncertainty affecting the\nstudent assignment vestige also prevented a finding of unitariness as to\ntransportation.    959 F. Supp. at 1168.     In Freeman the Supreme Court\nforesaw the possibility of such intertwining. \"Two or more Green factors\nmay be intertwined or synergistic in their relation, so that a\nconstitutional violation in one area cannot be eliminated unless the\njudicial remedy addresses other matters as well.\" 503 U.S. at 497. There\nis no clear error in the district court's finding.\n      As to the facilities factor, the district court found that certain\ncourt-ordered renovations remain to be completed. 959 F. Supp. at 1168.\nThe district court did not\n\n\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\ferr in requiring the terms of the court's decree to be completely fulfilled\nbefore relinquishing the ability to enforce compliance with the decree.\n\n      In considering the faculty and staff assignments factor, the district\ncourt relied on the testimony of the State's witness Dr. Armor, who\ntestified that, while the KCMSD had once complied with the court's orders\nto bring about racial balance in faculty and staff assignments, the\npercentage of elementary schools complying with the balance guidelines had\n\"decreased steadily\" in recent years.       Id. at 1168.    The court also\nconcluded that it was necessary for the court to retain control over\nfaculty appointments in order to maintain flexibility in other areas, such\nas reducing expenditures. Id. Under Freeman, the district court retains\ndiscretion to determine whether to relinquish jurisdiction on a piecemeal\nbasis. See 503 U.S. at 493. Where the district court has reason to retain\nsupervision over an area to aid its jurisdiction over unfinished business,\nFreeman certainly does not require the court to declare partial\nunitariness. See id. at 497-98.\n\n      We thus conclude that the district court did not err in finding that\nthe achievement gap vestige had not been remedied to the extent\npracticable, and that four out of the five Green factors had not been\nremedied. Thus, the KCMSD could not be held unitary in any aspect other\nthan extra-curricular activities.\n\n                                    V.\n\n      The Jenkins Class appeals the district court's approval of the\nagreement between the State and the KCMSD. Pursuant to the agreement, the\nState will be dismissed from this litigation after it pays the KCMSD\napproximately $320 million over three fiscal years to implement\ndesegregation remedies in the district.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\f                                    A.\n\n      The Jenkins Class contends that we review the district court's\napproval of the agreement de novo. The State contends that the district\ncourt had discretion to modify its earlier remedial orders based on changed\nconditions, and that we review such a modification only under an abuse of\ndiscretion standard. The KCMSD argues that the district court has broad\ndiscretion to determine the scope of its remedy.\n\n      There is no single blueprint or universal answer for desegregation\ncases, see Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 287 (1977), and \"there is\nobviously no one plan that will do the job in every case.\" See Green, 391\nU.S. at 439. Instead, the district court, which has \"firsthand experience\nwith the parties and is best qualified to deal with the 'flinty,\nintractable realities of day-to-day implementation of constitutional\ncommands,'\" has broad and flexible equitable powers to fashion\ndesegregation remedies.    United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 184\n(1987) (quoting Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1,\n6 (1971)). \"Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a\ndistrict court's equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for\nbreadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\" Swann, 402\nU.S. at 15; see also Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch.\nDist., 839 F.2d 1296, 1314 (8th Cir.) (the district court has \"broad\nremedial authority in dismantling segregation\"), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 869\n(1988). Because the district court possesses such broad discretion, \"[o]ur\nstandard of review of the district court's actions . . . is restricted.\"\nJenkins, 855 F.2d at 1299. We must \"give great deference to a district\ncourt's exercise of its broad equitable powers in crafting a remedy in\nschool desegregation cases.\" Jenkins v. Missouri, 965 F.2d 654, 656 (8th\nCir. 1992).\n\n      The district court retains this broad equitable authority throughout\nthe entire desegregation case to modify the remedy as it deems necessary.\nIndeed, the district court has often done so during the long life of this\ncase, and we have affirmed such modifications. The court has \"inherent\ncapacity to adjust remedies in a feasible and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fpractical way to eliminate\" the unconstitutional conditions. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 487, 489 (holding that the district court had discretion \"to order\nan incremental or partial withdrawal of its supervision and control\"). In\nan earlier Jenkins opinion, we described the district court's broad and\ncontinuing equitable authority:\n\n     [A] federal court has \"inherent jurisdiction in the exercise of\n     its equitable discretion and subject to appropriate appellate\n     review to vacate or modify its injunctions.\" Booker v. Special\n     School Dist. No. 1, 585 F.2d 347, 352 (8th Cir. 1978), cert.\n     denied, 443 U.S. 915 (1979). School desegregation plans are\n     particularly likely to need adjustment. As the Supreme Court\n     has observed regarding such cases: \"[E]quity has been\n     characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its\n     remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public\n     and private needs.\" Milliken [v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 288\n     (1977)] (quoting Brown v. Board of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 300\n     (1955)). . . .\n\n           We have said that the basic responsibility for\n     determining whether and to what extent an injunction should be\n     modified \"rests primarily on the shoulders of the district\n     court that issued the injunction in the first place.\" Booker,\n     585 F.2d at 353.\n\nJenkins v. Missouri, 931 F.2d 470, 482 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S.\n967 (1991).\n\n      Thus, our review of the district court's order approving the\nagreement is limited, and we may reverse that order only if we conclude\nthat it was an abuse of the court's discretion. See, e.g., Swann, 402 U.S.\nat 31 (court must affirm desegregation order        if it is reasonable,\nfeasible, and workable). To the extent that the court based its order on\nfindings of fact, those findings \"may not be disturbed unless clearly\nerroneous.\" Jenkins, 855 F.2d at 1300. With these standards in mind, we\nnow consider the merits of the agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f                                   B.\n\n      Certain aspects of the agreement, and its intended effect, are\ngreatly troubling to us. The two constitutional violators, the State and\nthe KCMSD, have agreed to release one of the violators, the State, from any\nfurther duty to the constitutional victims beyond the duty to pay the\nspecified sums of money. The constitutional victims are not a party to\nthis agreement.    We must bear in mind, however, the Supreme Court's\ndirective in Jenkins III that the district court \"should consider that the\nState's role with respect to the quality education programs has been\nlimited to the funding, not the implementation, of those programs.\" 515\nU.S. at 101.    The Court also reaffirmed the district court's ability to\ndeclare partial unitary status and permit the violator's partial withdrawal\nin phases. See id. at 88, 101. With the Supreme Court's directives in\nmind, we will now turn to the considerations supporting approval of the\nagreement.\n\n      The basic foundation for the district court's approval of the\nagreement is its assumption that the KCMSD will be unitary within two to\nthree years. As set forth in parts III and IV of this opinion, we affirm\nthe court's findings regarding unitary status both as to educational\nachievement and as to the Green factors.\n\n      The court properly recognized that the Supreme Court's standard for\nunitary status does not require total elimination of the vestiges of\ndiscrimination, including the achievement gap, but focuses on whether those\nvestiges have \"been eliminated to the extent practicable.\"       Id. at 89\n(quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492). Perhaps the district judge who has\nlived with this case for nearly twenty years was making an optimistic\nprediction about the KCMSD's progress toward desegregation in the next two\nto three years. On the other hand, however, we must affirm if the district\ncourt's findings support its conclusion that a period of two to three years\nwill allow the remaining vestiges to be eliminated to the extent\npracticable.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\f      The district court relied primarily on the testimony of Dr. John\nMurphy, a former school superintendent for both the Prince George's County,\nMaryland district and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg district in North Carolina,\nas well as other districts. Both Prince George's County and Charlotte-\nMecklenburg were subject to court desegregation orders during Dr. Murphy's\ntenure. Dr. Murphy was asked to develop a transition plan to focus on\nimproving the quality of learning in the KCMSD with the understanding that\nthere would be a significant reduction in expenditures over three years.\nHe expressed the opinion this could be done. Dr. Murphy testified that the\nagreement would provide the KCMSD with approximately $6,000 per pupil per\nyear, an amount which would be sufficient not only to offer a quality\neducation, but also to make the curriculum and other reforms necessary to\nimprove student achievement. There was evidence in the record that Dr.\nMurphy had achieved similar goals in Prince George's County while spending\n$5,405 per pupil. While it may be true that Dr. Murphy's testimony dealt\nwith one-third of the district he supervised in the 1992-93 school year and\nwith costs for a different time and locality, the weight of his testimony\nwas to be assessed by the district court. His testimony was clear that the\nlevel of funding provided by the agreement would be         sufficient   to\nimplement the strategies and improvements that he believed were necessary\nin the KCMSD, similar to those in Charlotte-Mecklenburg or Prince George's\nCounty. The phase-out over a three-year period was critical to Dr. Murphy,\nand he testified that a gradual reduction in funding would allow district\nadministration and staff to do a better job, even while resources were\nbeing tightened.\n\n      Dr. Michael Stolee, an experienced educator and former director of\nthe Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center, provided evidence\nregarding student assignments.     He testified that the KCMSD could be\nreorganized within a two-year period at a cost paid by anticipated revenues\nin a manner to eliminate racial isolation to the extent practicable.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f      The district court ordered the KCMSD to reduce the achievement gap\nby 2.6 NCEs within three years. 959 F. Supp. at 1179. Although the court\nwas unable to say with absolute certainty that the KCMSD will have attained\nunitary status within the next three years, the court nevertheless\nconcluded that the three-year period was a reasonable time frame for the\nKCMSD to accomplish its task. Id.      The court noted that some witnesses\nhad testified that two to three years was sufficient to eliminate some of\nthe remaining vestiges, while other witnesses had testified that three to\nfive years would be required. Id. It concluded that three years should\nbe sufficient. Id.     The court did not find that the remaining vestiges\ncan be eliminated to the extent practicable within this period, but rather\nexpressed a judgment as to the extent of the State's remaining obligation,\nwhich was based on the testimony before it. We cannot conclude that the\ndistrict court erred or abused its discretion in this regard.\n\n      With respect to the remaining Green factors, as we noted above, the\ndistrict court made factual findings that unitariness could be accomplished\nin these areas within two to three years. We have reviewed the record as\na whole and conclude that these findings are not clearly erroneous. To the\nextent there are conflicts in the evidence, resolution of such conflicts\nis for the district court.\n\n      In light of the evidence before the district court, we cannot hold\nits findings to be clearly erroneous or its conclusion to be an abuse of\ndiscretion. We confess that if we were the trier of fact, we would not\nhave reached this result with respect to the achievement gap. Our duty,\nhowever, is to review the district court's findings for clear error, rather\nthan to make our own findings, and we do not find a basis for reversal\nunder this standard.\n\n                                    C.\n\n      It is also significant that the time frame for terminating state\nfunding contemplated by the agreement is similar to that envisioned by the\ndistrict court several\n\n\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fyears ago. In 1993, the court called upon the parties to submit plans for\nterminating funding based on assumptions that the termination would occur\nin three, five, seven, or ten years. See District Court's Order of April\n16, 1993, slip op. at 21. The longer periods would terminate funding in\neither 2000 or 2003. The agreement provides for State payments over three\nyears, which the KCMSD has agreed to spend over five years, thus providing\nfunding until the year 2001 or 2002. Therefore, there is only a small\ndifference between the timing of terminating State funding under the\nagreement and the time frame previously contemplated by the district court.\nResolving issues such as extent and degree is a core function of the\ndistrict court, and it has considerable discretion in this task. We cannot\nconclude that the district court abused its discretion in approving this\nperiod for the phase-out of the State's funding obligation.\n\n                                          D.\n\n      We have described the State's role in implementing desegregation\nremedies in this case as being limited to only providing funding. This\nissue merits further discussion.9\n\n      Certainly, the Missouri Constitution imposes broader responsibilities\nupon the State than simply providing financing.       It provides that the\nGeneral Assembly shall establish and maintain free public schools for the\ninstruction of all children in the State, and that the supervision of\ninstruction in the public schools shall be vested in a state board of\neducation. Mo. Const. art. IX, §§ 1(a), 2(a).\n\n      The State bore a duty under the federal Constitution to eliminate the\ndual school system created by law, which indeed it has done, but its duty\ndid not end there. The\n\n\n\n\n      9\n       We must first pause to say that the State's funding-only role has come about\nthrough the State's conscious policy choices to so limit its involvement. We do not\nbelieve that either state or federal law contemplated such a limited role for the State.\n\n                                         -30-\n\fState was further required to eliminate the vestiges of such system to the\nextent practicable, a far broader responsibility.            Despite this\nconstitutional responsibility, however, the State's only action besides\nfunding has essentially been limited to repeatedly objecting to the remedy\nproposals submitted by both the Jenkins Class and the KCMSD, as shown by\na perusal of this court's opinions.\n\n      Thus, the State's role in this protracted litigation has evolved into\none of funding only. The agreement essentially acknowledges the present\nstate of affairs, and the KCMSD, by entering into the agreement, has\nexpressed its acceptance of this limited role.10\n\n      Funding for the KCMSD is unquestionably critical to the continuing\nsuccess of the district's programs. Indeed, the present level of funding,\non which the continuing operation of the schools is dependent, exists only\nbecause of the district court's authority to enjoin enforcement of state\nlaws that bar the KCMSD from establishing a levy sufficient to operate the\nschools. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 52 (1990). We also note\nthat the Missouri General Assembly, in its most recent session, passed a\nhouse joint resolution submitting for state-wide voter consideration a\nconstitutional amendment to allow the KCMSD to maintain the levy at its\npresent level with district voter approval, thereby providing a means for\ncontinued financial support of the KCMSD independent of court order after\nthe KCMSD is no longer under court supervision. See 1997 Mo. Legis. Serv.\nH.J.R. No. 9 (Vernon's).\n\n      Sufficient funding is absolutely essential to the school district's\ncontinued viability.    All parties agree that the loss of the level of\nfunding under the current levy would be catastrophic and would reduce the\ndistrict's funding to less than half the\n\n\n\n\n      10\n        During oral argument, the parties identified a number of State programs that are\nbeing developed that will be available to the KCMSD, but these programs have not yet\nhad a significant impact on the district.\n\n                                         -31-\n\famount that has been available to the KCMSD for a number of years. Should\nthis loss of funding occur, it would present a changed circumstance that\ncould call for reconsideration of the agreement.\n\n                                          E.\n\n      The Jenkins Class argues that the State cannot be dismissed because\nit is both a constitutional violator and a defendant subject to joint and\nseveral liability.    The district court has concluded that the State's\nliability as constitutional violator will be satisfied by the payments\ncalled for in the settlement. It has amended the remedy with regard to\njoint and several liability.11 Although the agreement contemplates the\ndismissal of the State in the future, the KCMSD will nevertheless remain\nsubject to court supervision as a constitutional violator liable to the\nconstitutional victims. The KCMSD has not sought a declaration of unitary\nstatus with respect to any part of its operations. The effect of the\nagreement is that the KCMSD now bears sole responsibility for implementing\nthe desegregation remedy and obtaining the funding necessary to do so.\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        We have considered, and now reject, the Jenkins Class's other arguments in\nopposition to the agreement. The Class analogizes the agreement to a contract and\ncontends that it cannot be bound by a contract to which it is not a party. Regardless\nof the agreement, the district court's order is not akin to a contract. The Class\npresented its objections to the district court, those objections were overruled, and the\nClass is now bound by that order to the same extent as any other court order in this\ncase.\n\n       The Class also argues that the district court erred in approving the agreement\nbecause: (1) the court was not presented with a justiciable controversy; (2) the order\nis invalid as an advisory opinion; and (3) the agreement cannot be viewed as an\nalternative remedy plan because the State did not seek declaratory relief. These\narguments must fail based on our holding that the court's approval of the agreement was\nan exercise of its continuing equitable authority to devise and implement a remedy in\nthis case.\n\n                                         -32-\n\f      In the district court's order approving the settlement, the court\nexpressed concerns about the KCMSD's management, including its top-heavy\nadministration. 959 F. Supp. at 1175-77. The court acknowledged that the\nKCMSD has made significant progress in the face of substantial obstacles,\nnot the least of which has been the ever-shifting leadership in the KCMSD\nadministration.     Id. at 1173.       There have been ten         district\nsuperintendents in the last nine years. Id. The district court made plain\nthat it was simply making observations, and not findings of fact, and that\nits observations played no role in its decision to approve the agreement.\nWe find instructive, however, the court's identification of areas in which\nthe district's performance has been \"dismal at best.\" Id. These include:\n(1) the KCMSD still lacks a comprehensive integrated educational and\ninstructional plan; (2) the KCMSD's fragmented efforts to implement\nmeaningful staff development measures have fallen far short of the mark;\n(3) ongoing administrative instability has plagued the KCMSD for years,\nresulting in a lack of accountability for deficiencies; (4) the KCMSD still\nlacks a security plan; and (5) the KCMSD is unable to produce a budget for\na particular fiscal year and reconcile it with actual expenditures for\nspecific line items. Id. at 1173-74.\n\n      The district judge making these observations, Judge Russell Clark,\nhas presided over this litigation from its inception in 1977 until his\ndecision to withdraw following issuance of the order which we now review.\nIn that twenty-year period, this case was consistently before the court,\nand Judge Clark's extensive knowledge of conditions in the district has\ncome the hard way, through numerous hearings. His observations point to\nthe nature of the problems facing the district and sharply contrast with\nthe type of operation described by Dr. Murphy in his testimony. Needless\nto say, these problems are substantial obstacles to the KCMSD's satisfying\nits obligation to provide quality education.        These obstacles are a\nchallenge to the KCMSD's management, and also impose a heavy duty on the\ndistrict court to closely supervise and monitor the KCMSD management.\nThus, in entering into this agreement, the KCMSD may well have brought upon\nitself a circumstance that will subject it to more, rather than less,\njudicial\n\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fsupervision, particularly during the transition period of the next three\nto four years, and until the vestiges of segregation have been eliminated\nto the extent practicable.\n\n      The district court stated that the KCMSD's administration was not up\nto the task of eliminating the remaining vestiges within the short time\nrequired by the court. It expressed the view that a strong hand with\neducational expertise and no \"vested interest\" was essential to accomplish\nthe difficult goals in this transitory period. Id. at 1178. We have\nreferred to the refusal of the court's request that Dr. Bartman and DESE\nplay a role in this respect. The district court stated that in this event\nit would consider appointment of a special master to oversee the KCMSD and\nurged that time was of the essence. We are in full agreement that on\nremand the district court should promptly consider the issue of appropriate\nsupervision over the district. The deficiencies outlined by the district\ncourt which we have discussed above and achievement of the goal of\nattaining unitary status are difficult and complex. We agree with the\ndistrict court that this is attainable, but it will require skillful and\ncomplex administrative and management effort. We leave to the discretion\nof the district court how best to exercise its oversight. Time is short,\nand the district court must do what is necessary to assure that the goals\nare achieved.\n\n      We affirm in all respects the district court's statements concerning\nthe transition leading to return of the district to local control. The\ngoal is to eliminate, to the extent practicable, the vestiges of\ndiscrimination in this school district, and the district court should spare\nno effort in ensuring that this goal is reached.\n\n      Many aspects of the agreement and its effects are troublesome, and\nwe remain deeply concerned about the future of the KCMSD.      The issue of\nwhether the district court erred in approving the agreement is a close one.\n Nevertheless, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in its\nfactual findings regarding the agreement, nor that it abused its discretion\nin approving the agreement and, in effect, modifying the earlier remedy\nordered by the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fWe thus affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nA true copy.\n\n     Attest:\n\n           CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                            -35-\n\f",

Less than a month later, the State\nand the KCMSD entered into an agreement under which the State would pay the\nKCMSD a total of $320 million over three years and be released from any\nfurther obligation in this desegregation litigation. The court held a\nhearing from January 13 through January 31, 1997, receiving testimony from\na large number of witnesses and a considerable volume of documentary\nevidence. On March 25, 1997, the district court1 entered its order denying\nthe motion for unitary status in all respects except extra-curricular\nactivities, but approving the agreement between the State and the KCMSD.\nJenkins v.

The court then briefly reviewed the progress made in the\nKCMSD. 959 F.

Id. at 1156-57. It pointed out that\nonce a court has found an unlawful dual school system, the plaintiffs are\nentitled to a presumption that existing disparities are causally related\nto prior segregation, and the burden of proving otherwise rests on\ndefendants. Id. at 1157 (citing Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110142\"><a href=\"/opinion/110142/dayton-bd-of-ed-v-brinkman/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537 (1979); Keyes v.

One of the vestiges the court found was an achievement gap\nbetween black and white students in the KCMSD. The State argued that the\nJenkins Class should bear the burden of proving that this student\nachievement disparity was caused by the State's constitutional violation.\nThe court rejected the State's arguments, concluding that the achievement\ngap issue should be governed by the same burden-shifting rules as the other\nfactors, and that the State must prove it did not cause the disparity. Id.\n\n\n      The court analyzed in detail the testimony on this issue, including\nexpert opinions. The court found that a portion of the achievement gap was\nattributable to de jure segregation and that unitary status had not been\nattained in this respect. The court ordered the KCMSD to eliminate that\nportion of the achievement gap within three years. Id. at 1165.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f      The court then turned to an analysis of the Green factors.3 With\nrespect to student assignments or the racial isolation vestige, the court\nrecognized testimony that the KCMSD had realized a high degree of racial\nbalance, but pointed out that the schools lost significant enrollment of\nwhite suburban students in the 1995-96 school year following the Jenkins\nIII decision. Id. at 1166. Moreover, the racial imbalance index showed\nan increase in 1996 for both elementary and secondary schools. Id. The\ncourt looked at testimony that the KCMSD must develop and implement a\nstudent assignment system focusing exclusively on the pupils residing in\nthe district, and that this could be accomplished within a two- to three-\nyear period. Id. The district court concluded that the KCMSD had not yet\nachieved unitary status with regard to the racial isolation vestige, but\nthat within a three-year period it would be possible to assess the effects\nof Jenkins III on minority enrollment. Id. at 1167.\n\n      With respect to faculty and staff assignments, the district court\nrecounted the testimony that the district had maintained a substantial\ndegree of racial balance in faculty assignments. Id. at 1166. However,\nthe court also recognized testimony that, during recent years, while the\nsecondary schools fell within the desired variance level, the elementary\nschools had shown a steady decline in compliance. Id. at 1166. The court\nheld that the steady decline at the elementary school level of a balanced\nfaculty warranted further investigation, and so \"the court [found] that the\nKCMSD has not yet achieved unitary status as to faculty assignments.\" Id.\nat 1168. However, the court also stated that the KCMSD should be able to\nremedy this defect in a period of three years. Id.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         In Green v. County School Board, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435 (1968), the Supreme\nCourt stated that school districts were obliged to desegregate all aspects of their school\nsystems, including: student assignments, faculty and staff assignments, transportation,\nfacilities, and extra-curricular activities. Disparities in these five aspects of a school's\noperations are the most important indicia of a segregated school system. See Jenkins\nIII, 515 U.S. at 88.\n\n                                            -7-\n\f      With respect to the facilities of the KCMSD, the court observed that\nthe capital improvements already ordered were almost, but not entirely,\ncompleted. The court held that declaration of unitary status should be\nwithheld until the ordered improvements were completed, which would\ncertainly be accomplished in less than three years. Id. at 1168.\n\n      The court held that transportation was so closely related to the\nracial isolation vestige that it was not advisable to relinquish\njurisdiction over the transportation aspect until the KCMSD was unitary in\nstudent assignments. The court therefore declined to find the State had\ncarried its burden of proof on the transportation vestige. Id.\n\n      As to the State's motion for unitary status regarding extra-\ncurricular activities, the court held that the State has carried its burden\nof proving the KCMSD unitary in this respect. The adverse parties seem to\nagree on this issue. Id. The court rejected the State's argument in all\nother respects.\n      The court then considered whether to approve the agreement between\nthe State and the KCMSD releasing the State from liability upon the payment\nof $314 million (plus an additional $6 million added by the court after the\nagreement was entered). Id. at 1152. The court looked at various figures\nreflecting the spending level in the KCMSD per pupil as compared with the\nother largest school districts in the United States. Id. at 1170. It\nrecited the testimony of Dr. John Murphy that the transition funding\nprovided under the agreement would be sufficient to allow a systematic and\norderly transition period during which the KCMSD could become self-\nsufficient. It looked to Dr. Murphy's testimony that if the agreement were\napproved, the KCMSD would have sufficient funds not only to offer quality\neducation, but to make the curriculum and other reforms necessary to\nimprove student achievement.     Id.  The court also looked at testimony\nconcerning the possibilities of the KCMSD achieving other savings, such\nas reduced transportation expenditures. The fact that much of the capital\nimprovement program had been paid for out of current revenue, rather than\ndebt,\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fcreated a situation in which the district would have to pay little for debt\nservice in future years. Id. at 1171. The court also considered that the\nracial isolation vestige could be rectified in two years, and that many of\nthe goals of the quality education programs had been reached. Id. at 1171-\n72.\n\n      The district court rejected arguments of the Jenkins Class that the\ncourt had no authority or jurisdiction to approve the agreement. Id. at\n1172. The district court concluded that, considering the KCMSD's proximity\nto unitary status, any remaining obligation of the State to the KCMSD\nschool children would be discharged by the payment of the funds provided\nin the agreement. It observed that the State has been responsible for the\nfunding, and not the implementation, of the desegregation programs. The\ncourt therefore modified the joint and several liability finding to make\nthe KCMSD liable individually.       The court decreed that the State's\nobligation shall end and the State will be entitled to an order from the\ncourt dismissing it from the action when it has paid the sums provided for\nin the agreement. Id.\n\n      While the court had released the State from further obligations,\nexcept for the payment of funds, it suggested that Dr. Robert Bartman of\nthe Department of Elementary and Secondary Education of Missouri had the\neducational expertise and familiarity with the history of the KCMSD\ndesegregation effort to provide guidance during the transition period, and\nthat the Department should give approval before decisions are made about\nthe necessary budget cuts. Id. at 1178. This was made as an appeal to the\nDepartment and Dr. Bartman's sense of duty. The court concluded that if\nthe Department and Dr. Bartman declined the court's appeal, then the court\nwould seek the Department's help in finding a special master to oversee the\nKCMSD. Id. at 1179. We are informed that the Department and Dr. Bartman\nhave declined this invitation. The issue, however, remains before the\ndistrict court, and while the district judge presiding over this case for\nmany years has turned over superintendence of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fcase to another judge,4 we are satisfied that the urgency of timely\ndisposition of further supervision over the district will be promptly\nconsidered.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      The State argues that it is entitled to a declaration that the KCMSD\nhas achieved unitary status.     Interestingly, the KCMSD, as well as the\nJenkins Class, defend the district court's holding that the KCMSD is not\nunitary. The threshold issue is whether the State or the Jenkins Class\nbears the burden of proof on this issue.\n\n      Generally, once there has been a finding that a defendant established\nan unlawful dual school system in the past, there is a presumption that\ncurrent disparities are the result of the defendant's unconstitutional\nconduct.

The State contends this\ndistinction is appropriate because the defendants have control over the\nGreen factors, such as student assignment, equality of facilities, and\ntransportation, whereas the defendants do not have control over student\nachievement. The State argues that too many external factors affect student\nachievement to require the State to prove that it did not cause low\nminority achievement.\n\n      This argument is not persuasive.    As the Supreme Court noted in\nJenkins III, the Green factors can also be affected by forces outside the\ndefendants' control:\n\n     Just as demographic changes independent of de jure segregation\n     will affect the racial composition of student assignments, so\n     too will numerous external factors beyond the control of the\n     KCMSD and the State affect minority student achievement.\n\n515 U.S. at 102 (citation omitted). The task of the court in analyzing\neither type of disparity is to determine whether it was caused by\ndefendants' misconduct or by external factors. The burden of proof rules\nare simply the framework for making that inquiry.\n\n      There is, nevertheless, a meaningful distinction between the Green\nfactors and the student achievement factor.     Disparities in the Green\nfactors, such as student assignment, inherently define a dual school\nsystem, which could not exist without such disparities. See Coalition to\nSave Our Children v. State Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722543\"><a href=\"/opinion/722543/coalition-to-save-our-children-v-state-board-of-education-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 776 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(Green factors are per se vestiges of de jure segregation). On the other\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fhand, disparity or impairment in student achievement may or may not be\nfound in a    particular case and may or may not be the result of a\nsegregated or dual system. For this reason, the presumption of causation\nwill only be applied to student achievement disparities if the court has\nalready specifically found that student achievement in the district has\nsuffered as a result of the dual system. Thus, in Coalition to Save Our\nChildren, the district court had not included disparity in student\nachievement as a subject for ancillary (i.e., non-Green) relief in its\nremedial decree. When the defendants later moved for a declaration of\nunitary status, the Third Circuit held that the plaintiffs had the burden\nof proving that disparities in student achievement were vestiges of de jure\nsegregation. Id. at 776-77. Accord City of Yonkers, 833 F. Supp. at 222\nn.3 (no initial finding that segregation caused reduction in student\nachievement; plaintiffs bear burden of showing causation).\n\n      In the early days of this case, the district court specifically found\nimpairment in student achievement in the KCMSD was a result of the dual\nschool system. In 1984 the district court found:\n\n     The Court finds the inferior education indigenous of the state-\n     compelled dual school system has lingering effects in the\n     Kansas City, Missouri School District.\n\n593 F. Supp. at 1492.   Again, in 1985, the District Court found:\n\n           Segregation has caused a system wide reduction in student\n     achievement in the schools of the KCMSD . . . .\n\n     . . . .\n\n     . . . [The] education process has been further \"bogged down\" in\n     the KCMSD by a history of segregated education.

Therefore, the Jenkins Class was entitled to a\npresumption that current deficiencies in student achievement were a\ncontinuation of the vestige already identified.

In fact, the Supreme Court did not      say the district court's\nstudent achievement findings were insufficient to establish liability for\nthe student achievement vestige. To the contrary, the Court specifically\ncontemplated that the reduction in student achievement must be remedied:\n\n     Thus, the proper response by the District Court should have\n     been to eliminate to the extent practicable the vestiges of\n     prior de jure segregation within the KCMSD: a system-wide\n     reduction in student achievement and the existence of 25\n     racially identifiable schools. . . .\n\n\n515 U.S. at 90. As the State points out, the Court observed that the\ndistrict court had never made findings on the severity of the vestige, or\nthe \"incremental effect that segregation has had on minority student\nachievement or the specific goals of the quality education programs.\" Id.\nat 101. The Court made this observation in the context of discussing what\nmeasure of improvement should be required to establish unitariness. In the\nsame paragraph the Court stated: \"Under our precedents, the State and the\nKCMSD are entitled to a rather precise statement of [their] obligations\nunder a desegregation decree.\" Id. (quotation omitted). The Court did not\nquestion the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fexistence of the achievement vestige; instead, it ordered that the district\ncourt clarify the quantum of the student achievement vestige, so that the\nparties could know what mark they and the court were aiming at. But see\nid. at 118 (Thomas, J., concurring) (questioning validity of 1984 finding).\nIn the order we review today, the district court complied faithfully with\nthe Supreme Court's command to quantify the vestige.\n\n      The State also argues that the passage of time since the days of\nstate-mandated segregation makes it inappropriate to presume that current\nconditions resulted from that segregation. Justice Scalia's concurrence\nin Freeman suggested that the passage of time renders the presumption of\ncausation inappropriate. See 503 U.S. at 506 (Scalia, J., concurring)\n(\"[T]he rational basis for the extraordinary presumption of causation\nsimply must dissipate as the de jure system and the school boards who\nproduced it recede further into the past.\"). However, the majority opinion\nin Freeman continued to recognize the presumption. The majority opinion\nacknowledged that the passage of time does have some probative value,\ntending to strengthen a defendant's case that de jure segregation did not\ncause current disparities. The majority stated:\n\n           As the de jure violation becomes more remote in time and\n     these demographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely\n     that a current racial imbalance in a school district is a\n     vestige of the prior de jure system. . . . In light of its\n     finding that the demographic changes in DeKalb County are\n     unrelated to the prior violation, the District Court was\n     correct to entertain the suggestion that DCSS had no duty to\n     achieve system-wide racial balance in the student population.\n\nId. at 496. At the same time, the Freeman majority reiterated: \"The\nschool district bears the burden of showing that any current imbalance is\nnot traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior violation.\" Id. at 494.\nKeyes specifically rejected the idea that the passage of time could cause\nthe burden to shift back to the plaintiffs: \"[C]ertainly plaintiffs in a\nschool desegregation case are not required to prove 'cause' in the sense\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fof 'non-attenuation.'\" 413 U.S. at 211 n.17. Therefore, we conclude that\nthe passage of time6 is an evidentiary consideration, but not a bar to the\nusual burden-shifting rules.\n\n      The State also argues that the presumption of invidious causation\nshould not be applied to the State because the State's obligation has only\nbeen to pay for the remedy, not to implement it.        We deal with this\nargument infra at pages 16-18.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      Jenkins III reiterated the standard for determining whether a school\ndistrict has become unitary:\n            [A]mong the factors which must inform the sound\n            discretion of the court in ordering partial\n            withdrawal are the following:    [1] whether there\n            has been full and satisfactory compliance with the\n            decree in those aspects of the system where\n            supervision is to be withdrawn; [2] whether\n            retention   of judicial control is necessary or\n            practicable to achieve compliance with the decree\n            in other facets of the school system; and [3]\n            whether the school district has demonstrated, to\n            the public and to the parents and students of the\n            once disfavored race, its good-faith commitment to\n            the whole of the court's decree and to those\n            provisions of the\n\n\n\n\n      6\n         The passage of time is often overstated by reference to the time of the de jure\nviolations or the duration of this suit.

Before we reach this issue, we will briefly\ncomment on whether there has been full and satisfactory compliance with the\ndecree in those aspects where supervision is to be withdrawn, and whether\nthe State has demonstrated to the public, the parents, and the students of\nthe once disfavored race a good faith commitment to the whole of the court\ndecree.\n\n      The Supreme Court observed that the State's role with respect to\nquality education programs has been limited to funding, not implementation,\nof these programs. Jenkins III, 515 U.S. at 101. The district court\nrecognized the Supreme Court's language in its opinion. 959 F. Supp. at\n1172. With the passage of time this has been the nature of the State's\ncompliance. It should be remarked, however, that in the early days of\ncrafting the intra-district remedy, the Jenkins Class, the KCMSD, and the\nState were called upon to submit proposed remedial plans, and did so. The\nearly orders of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthe district court accepted the plans put forth by the Jenkins Class and\nthe KCMSD, and rejected the State's proposals as inadequate.

Perhaps this established a pattern of either\nthe Jenkins Class or the KCMSD assuming responsibility for proposing\nremedial measures, and the State relying upon legal objections to the plan\nand ultimately ceasing any effort to make a contribution toward directing\nor administering the aspects of the remedy. The State had an opportunity\nto help shape the remedy, and perhaps the long history of this litigation\nwould have been different had it accepted the challenge to do more than pay\nwhen ordered to do so. Nevertheless, this pattern having been established,\nthe State has undoubtedly complied with the decrees of the district court\nby funding the programs that have been ordered.\n\n      The State places great emphasis on the amount of money that has been\nspent in Kansas City. It must be remembered in looking back on the long\nhistory of this case, however, that the district court found and this\ncourt affirmed findings that the physical plant of the KCMSD had literally\nrotted; that the inferior education indigenous of the state-compelled dual\nschool system has lingering effects in the Kansas City, Missouri School\nDistrict; that the general attitude of inferiority among blacks produces\nlow achievement which ultimately limits employment opportunities and causes\npoverty; and finally, that segregation has caused a system-wide reduction\nin student achievement in the schools of       the KCMSD.   See Jenkins v.\nMissouri, 855 F.2d at 1300 (citing district court decisions at 593 F. Supp.\nat 1492, 639 F. Supp. at 24, and 672 F. Supp. at 411).\n\n      Restoration of   the physical facilities has had a total cost of\napproximately $500 million, with funds contributed roughly equally by the\nState and the KCMSD. With respect to educational and other programs, the\nState has spent approximately $950 million, and the KCMSD has spent about\n$350 million.    The extensive constitutional violations have required\nextensive expenditures.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f      Suffice it to say that we are left with some question in our minds\nas to whether the State has demonstrated a \"good-faith commitment to the\nwhole of the court's decree and to those provisions of the law and the\nConstitution that were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first\ninstance.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491. Justice Souter, in his dissent in\nJenkins III, questioned the State's commitment to complying with the\ndistrict court's decree. He quoted the district court's statement that\n\"during the course of this lawsuit the Court has not been informed of one\naffirmative act voluntarily taken by the Executive Department of the State\nof Missouri or the Missouri General Assembly to aid a school district that\nis involved in a desegregation program.\" 515 U.S. at 152 (Souter, J.,\ndissenting) (quoting District Court's Order of Nov. 12, 1986, slip op. at\n7). Justice Souter also quoted the following statement of the district\ncourt:    \"The State, also a constitutional violator, has historically\nopposed the implementation of any program offered to desegregate the KCMSD.\n. . . [T]he State has never offered the Court a viable, even tenable,\nalternative and has been extremely antagonistic in its approach to\neffecting the desegregation of the KCMSD.\" Id. (quoting District Court's\nOrder of April 16, 1993, slip op. at 2).       In view of our analysis of\nwhether the vestiges of segregation have been remedied to the extent\npracticable, we need not further examine this issue.\n\n                                   III.\n\n      We now turn to the issue that the Supreme Court stated was the basic\ntask of the district court, namely deciding whether reduction in\nachievement by minority students attributable to prior de jure segregation\nhas been remedied to the extent practicable.    In Jenkins III the Supreme\nCourt said:\n\n     Under our precedents, the State and the KCMSD are \"entitled to\n     a rather precise statement of [their] obligations under a\n     desegregation decree.\" [Freeman, 498 U.S.] at 246. Although\n     the District Court has determined that \"[s]egregation has\n     caused a system wide reduction in achievement in\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f     the schools of the KCMSD,\" 639 F. Supp., at 24, it never has\n     identified the incremental effect that segregation has had on\n     minority student achievement or the specific goals of the\n     quality education programs.\n\n515 U.S. at 101.\n\n      In the order now before us, the district court directed its attention\nto identifying the incremental effect that segregation has had on minority\nstudent achievement, and also to specifying the goals of the quality\neducational programs. It should first be said that the district court in\nits order of September 17, 1984, pointed to evidence in the record before\nit in stating:\n\n     The general attitude of inferiority among blacks produces low\n     achievement which ultimately limits employment opportunities\n     and causes poverty. . . . The District stipulated that as of\n     1977 they had not eliminated all the vestiges of the prior dual\n     system. The Court finds the inferior education indigenous of\n     the state-compelled dual school system has lingering effects in\n     the Kansas City, Missouri School District.\n\n593 F. Supp. at 1492 (citations omitted).\n\n      The court pointed out further that various plans adopted by the KCMSD\nin an effort to reduce minority isolation had not been effective. The\ncourt stated:\n\n     During the 1983-84 year, no school had less than 30% black\n     enrollment; 24 schools however are racially isolated with 90 +\n     % black enrollment. The Court finds the District did not and\n     has not entirely dismantled the dual school system. Vestiges\n     of that dual system still remain.\n\nId. at 1493 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f      The court also stated that because most of the schools were in\nracially segregated neighborhoods before 1954, the adoption of the\nneighborhood school concept did not substantially change the segregated\nschool system.

Board\nof Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1955), did not aid the district's integration,\nbut on the contrary allowed segregated attendance patterns to continue.\n593 F. Supp. at 1494.\n\n      There is a significant relationship between the testimony the court\npointed to in 1984 and the testimony presented at the hearing in January\n1997 by the expert witnesses.\n\n      The State's expert witness, Dr. David Armor, testified that in\nanalyzing test scores of black and white students in the KCMSD, using a\nbell curve with a median score of 50 normalized curve equivalent (NCEs),\nwhites scored about ten NCEs higher than blacks. Armor testified that\n\"most, if not virtually all\" of this achievement gap in the Kansas City,\nMissouri School District was the result of socio-economic conditions.\nHowever, Dr. Armor could only identify socio-economic conditions accounting\nfor about two-thirds of the gap; the other third remained unexplained. 959\nF. Supp. at 1163.\n\n      On the other hand, the expert produced by the KCMSD, Dr. William\nTrent, testified that after controlling for poverty, family background, and\nother factors, there was still a \"race effect\" that could be due to past\nsegregation. Id. at 1158. The gap existed in 1986 and 1988, continues to\nexist now, and has never been eliminated. Dr. Trent concluded that about\n4% to 9% of the achievement gap was explained by race. Id. Significantly,\nthe State's expert, Dr. Armor, testified that the size of the achievement\ngap grows larger the longer the children remain in school. Id. at 1159.\nMoreover, Dr. Trent testified that teachers' low expectations of\nachievement in schools with high percentages of minority students also\ncontribute to the achievement gap. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f      After setting out the substance of the testimony of these expert\nwitnesses, the district court pointed out that the State's reliance on\nsocio-economic factors was inadequate to explain about 35% of the gap, even\ntaking the State's expert at his word. Id. at 1163. The court found that\nDr. Trent's analysis showing a \"race effect\" explaining 4-9% of the gap was\n\"reliable and accurately identifies the incremental portion attributable\nto the prior de jure discrimination.\"      Id.   The court found that the\nteacher expectation variable explains 2-4% of the gap, id., and that the\nteachers' lower expectations were a result of earlier de jure segregation.\nId. at 1164. The court took the high end of these ranges in reaching the\nfigure of 13%. The court also held that the increase in the gap as the\nchildren progressed through the KCMSD could also be attributed to\ndiscrimination, id. at 1165, and this, together with the gap when the\nstudents entered school, was 26% of the achievement gap.         The court\nconcluded that these figures translated into a mandate to the school\ndistrict to reduce the achievement gap by 2.6 NCEs. The court ordered that\nthis task was to be completed within three years. It concluded that KCMSD\nhas not currently attained unitary status regarding the quality of\neducation. Id.\n\n      It is evident that the district court rejected Dr. Armor's opinion\nthat socio-economic factors alone were the cause of the achievement gap in\nthe KCMSD. We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in making\nthis finding. The burden of proof was on the State to prove that it had\nnot caused the gap, and the State's expert could not explain a third of the\nachievement gap by his socio-economic theory. The State simply failed to\ncarry its burden, and our discussion could end at this point. But in\naddition, the district court accepted Dr. Trent's explanation quantifying\nthat part of the achievement gap resulting from race; that was a finding\nof fact based upon research by a well-qualified expert.7       Dr. Trent's\ntestimony provided a rational explanation for\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        The State briefly suggests that Dr. Trent's testimony did not \"rise to the level of\nevidence\" contemplated by Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). The State does not cite any reference to the record at which it objected\nto the evidence under Daubert. We therefore understand the State's argument to be a\nsubstantive argument about sufficiency of the evidence, rather than an evidentiary\nobjection.\n\n                                           -21-\n\fthe achievement gap and the extent of it, and we cannot conclude that the\ndistrict court erred in so finding.8\n\n                                         IV.\n\n      The State attacks the district court's denial of unitariness status\nas to four of the five Green factors--student assignments, faculty and\nstaff assignments, transportation, and facilities.\n\n      The KCMSD contended that the current racial balance within its\nschools was unknown because of the effect of the withdrawal of suburban\nstudents after Jenkins III. The district court observed that the student\nassignment aspect of the remedy in this case had depended primarily on\nvoluntary transfers from the suburbs in conjunction with magnet schools,\nrather than on mandatory reassignment. Id. at 1166. After Jenkins III,\nmany suburban students left the KCMSD. The district court found that the\n\"ramifications of the withdrawal of the 1476 white students cannot be\njudged at this time.\" Id. at 1167. The court declined to declare the\nKCMSD unitary in this regard until the effects of this change in the\nenrollment could be ascertained. Therefore, the State failed to carry its\nburden of proof that there was no student assignment vestige. The State\ncontends that, whatever the student assignment statistics, the KCMSD is not\ncurrently engaging in discriminatory student assignment practices, and\ntherefore there should be no vestige under Pasadena City Board of Education\nv.

It was the only testimony to address this issue, and came\nfrom all parties.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f      Under Spangler and Freeman, school districts that have once\neliminated the student assignment vestige are not required to readjust\nstudent assignments to compensate for subsequent imbalances caused by\nforces other than intentional segregation. \"Once the racial imbalance due\nto the de jure violation has been remedied, the school district is under\nno duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors.\"\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 494. The key distinction between this case, on the\none hand, and Spangler and Freeman, on the other, is that there is no\nfinding in this case that the KCMSD ever eliminated the student assignment\nvestige. The district court's strategy for eliminating this vestige was\nthe magnet school program, rather than the sort of unilateral reassignment\ndecree used in Spangler. See 427 U.S. at 435-36. This strategy was at\nleast partly aborted by the Jenkins III ruling, and the district court\nfound that, on the present state of the record, it was impossible to assess\nthe racial balance in the schools during the process of dismantling the\noriginal remedy. This finding was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the\nState's invocation of Spangler and Freeman on this point is premature. See\nVaughns v.

In Freeman the Supreme Court\nforesaw the possibility of such intertwining. \"Two or more Green factors\nmay be intertwined or synergistic in their relation, so that a\nconstitutional violation in one area cannot be eliminated unless the\njudicial remedy addresses other matters as well.\" 503 U.S. at 497. There\nis no clear error in the district court's finding.\n      As to the facilities factor, the district court found that certain\ncourt-ordered renovations remain to be completed. 959 F.

Id. at 1168.    The court also\nconcluded that it was necessary for the court to retain control over\nfaculty appointments in order to maintain flexibility in other areas, such\nas reducing expenditures. Id. Under Freeman, the district court retains\ndiscretion to determine whether to relinquish jurisdiction on a piecemeal\nbasis. See 503 U.S. at 493. Where the district court has reason to retain\nsupervision over an area to aid its jurisdiction over unfinished business,\nFreeman certainly does not require the court to declare partial\nunitariness. See id. at 497-98.\n\n      We thus conclude that the district court did not err in finding that\nthe achievement gap vestige had not been remedied to the extent\npracticable, and that four out of the five Green factors had not been\nremedied. Thus, the KCMSD could not be held unitary in any aspect other\nthan extra-curricular activities.\n\n                                    V.\n\n      The Jenkins Class appeals the district court's approval of the\nagreement between the State and the KCMSD.

See, e.g., Swann, 402 U.S.\nat 31 (court must affirm desegregation order        if it is reasonable,\nfeasible, and workable). To the extent that the court based its order on\nfindings of fact, those findings \"may not be disturbed unless clearly\nerroneous.\" Jenkins, 855 F.2d at 1300. With these standards in mind, we\nnow consider the merits of the agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f                                   B.\n\n      Certain aspects of the agreement, and its intended effect, are\ngreatly troubling to us. The two constitutional violators, the State and\nthe KCMSD, have agreed to release one of the violators, the State, from any\nfurther duty to the constitutional victims beyond the duty to pay the\nspecified sums of money. The constitutional victims are not a party to\nthis agreement.    We must bear in mind, however, the Supreme Court's\ndirective in Jenkins III that the district court \"should consider that the\nState's role with respect to the quality education programs has been\nlimited to the funding, not the implementation, of those programs.\" 515\nU.S. at 101.    The Court also reaffirmed the district court's ability to\ndeclare partial unitary status and permit the violator's partial withdrawal\nin phases. See id. at 88, 101. With the Supreme Court's directives in\nmind, we will now turn to the considerations supporting approval of the\nagreement.\n\n      The basic foundation for the district court's approval of the\nagreement is its assumption that the KCMSD will be unitary within two to\nthree years. As set forth in parts III and IV of this opinion, we affirm\nthe court's findings regarding unitary status both as to educational\nachievement and as to the Green factors.\n\n      The court properly recognized that the Supreme Court's standard for\nunitary status does not require total elimination of the vestiges of\ndiscrimination, including the achievement gap, but focuses on whether those\nvestiges have \"been eliminated to the extent practicable.\"       Id. at 89\n(quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492). Perhaps the district judge who has\nlived with this case for nearly twenty years was making an optimistic\nprediction about the KCMSD's progress toward desegregation in the next two\nto three years. On the other hand, however, we must affirm if the district\ncourt's findings support its conclusion that a period of two to three years\nwill allow the remaining vestiges to be eliminated to the extent\npracticable.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\f      The district court relied primarily on the testimony of Dr. John\nMurphy, a former school superintendent for both the Prince George's County,\nMaryland district and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg district in North Carolina,\nas well as other districts. Both Prince George's County and Charlotte-\nMecklenburg were subject to court desegregation orders during Dr. Murphy's\ntenure. Dr. Murphy was asked to develop a transition plan to focus on\nimproving the quality of learning in the KCMSD with the understanding that\nthere would be a significant reduction in expenditures over three years.\nHe expressed the opinion this could be done. Dr. Murphy testified that the\nagreement would provide the KCMSD with approximately $6,000 per pupil per\nyear, an amount which would be sufficient not only to offer a quality\neducation, but also to make the curriculum and other reforms necessary to\nimprove student achievement. There was evidence in the record that Dr.\nMurphy had achieved similar goals in Prince George's County while spending\n$5,405 per pupil. While it may be true that Dr. Murphy's testimony dealt\nwith one-third of the district he supervised in the 1992-93 school year and\nwith costs for a different time and locality, the weight of his testimony\nwas to be assessed by the district court. His testimony was clear that the\nlevel of funding provided by the agreement would be         sufficient   to\nimplement the strategies and improvements that he believed were necessary\nin the KCMSD, similar to those in Charlotte-Mecklenburg or Prince George's\nCounty. The phase-out over a three-year period was critical to Dr. Murphy,\nand he testified that a gradual reduction in funding would allow district\nadministration and staff to do a better job, even while resources were\nbeing tightened.\n\n      Dr. Michael Stolee, an experienced educator and former director of\nthe Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center, provided evidence\nregarding student assignments.     He testified that the KCMSD could be\nreorganized within a two-year period at a cost paid by anticipated revenues\nin a manner to eliminate racial isolation to the extent practicable.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f      The district court ordered the KCMSD to reduce the achievement gap\nby 2.6 NCEs within three years. 959 F. Supp. at 1179. Although the court\nwas unable to say with absolute certainty that the KCMSD will have attained\nunitary status within the next three years, the court nevertheless\nconcluded that the three-year period was a reasonable time frame for the\nKCMSD to accomplish its task. Id.      The court noted that some witnesses\nhad testified that two to three years was sufficient to eliminate some of\nthe remaining vestiges, while other witnesses had testified that three to\nfive years would be required. Id. It concluded that three years should\nbe sufficient. Id.     The court did not find that the remaining vestiges\ncan be eliminated to the extent practicable within this period, but rather\nexpressed a judgment as to the extent of the State's remaining obligation,\nwhich was based on the testimony before it. We cannot conclude that the\ndistrict court erred or abused its discretion in this regard.\n\n      With respect to the remaining Green factors, as we noted above, the\ndistrict court made factual findings that unitariness could be accomplished\nin these areas within two to three years. We have reviewed the record as\na whole and conclude that these findings are not clearly erroneous. To the\nextent there are conflicts in the evidence, resolution of such conflicts\nis for the district court.\n\n      In light of the evidence before the district court, we cannot hold\nits findings to be clearly erroneous or its conclusion to be an abuse of\ndiscretion. We confess that if we were the trier of fact, we would not\nhave reached this result with respect to the achievement gap. Our duty,\nhowever, is to review the district court's findings for clear error, rather\nthan to make our own findings, and we do not find a basis for reversal\nunder this standard.\n\n                                    C.\n\n      It is also significant that the time frame for terminating state\nfunding contemplated by the agreement is similar to that envisioned by the\ndistrict court several\n\n\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fyears ago. In 1993, the court called upon the parties to submit plans for\nterminating funding based on assumptions that the termination would occur\nin three, five, seven, or ten years. See District Court's Order of April\n16, 1993, slip op. at 21. The longer periods would terminate funding in\neither 2000 or 2003. The agreement provides for State payments over three\nyears, which the KCMSD has agreed to spend over five years, thus providing\nfunding until the year 2001 or 2002. Therefore, there is only a small\ndifference between the timing of terminating State funding under the\nagreement and the time frame previously contemplated by the district court.\nResolving issues such as extent and degree is a core function of the\ndistrict court, and it has considerable discretion in this task. We cannot\nconclude that the district court abused its discretion in approving this\nperiod for the phase-out of the State's funding obligation.\n\n                                          D.\n\n      We have described the State's role in implementing desegregation\nremedies in this case as being limited to only providing funding. This\nissue merits further discussion.9\n\n      Certainly, the Missouri Constitution imposes broader responsibilities\nupon the State than simply providing financing.       It provides that the\nGeneral Assembly shall establish and maintain free public schools for the\ninstruction of all children in the State, and that the supervision of\ninstruction in the public schools shall be vested in a state board of\neducation. Mo. Const. art. IX, §§ 1(a), 2(a).\n\n      The State bore a duty under the federal Constitution to eliminate the\ndual school system created by law, which indeed it has done, but its duty\ndid not end there. The\n\n\n\n\n      9\n       We must first pause to say that the State's funding-only role has come about\nthrough the State's conscious policy choices to so limit its involvement. We do not\nbelieve that either state or federal law contemplated such a limited role for the State.\n\n                                         -30-\n\fState was further required to eliminate the vestiges of such system to the\nextent practicable, a far broader responsibility.            Despite this\nconstitutional responsibility, however, the State's only action besides\nfunding has essentially been limited to repeatedly objecting to the remedy\nproposals submitted by both the Jenkins Class and the KCMSD, as shown by\na perusal of this court's opinions.\n\n      Thus, the State's role in this protracted litigation has evolved into\none of funding only. The agreement essentially acknowledges the present\nstate of affairs, and the KCMSD, by entering into the agreement, has\nexpressed its acceptance of this limited role.10\n\n      Funding for the KCMSD is unquestionably critical to the continuing\nsuccess of the district's programs. Indeed, the present level of funding,\non which the continuing operation of the schools is dependent, exists only\nbecause of the district court's authority to enjoin enforcement of state\nlaws that bar the KCMSD from establishing a levy sufficient to operate the\nschools. See Missouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112414\"><a href=\"/opinion/112414/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (1990). We also note\nthat the Missouri General Assembly, in its most recent session, passed a\nhouse joint resolution submitting for state-wide voter consideration a\nconstitutional amendment to allow the KCMSD to maintain the levy at its\npresent level with district voter approval, thereby providing a means for\ncontinued financial support of the KCMSD independent of court order after\nthe KCMSD is no longer under court supervision. See 1997 Mo. Legis. Serv.\nH.J.R. No. 9 (Vernon's).\n\n      Sufficient funding is absolutely essential to the school district's\ncontinued viability.    All parties agree that the loss of the level of\nfunding under the current levy would be catastrophic and would reduce the\ndistrict's funding to less than half the\n\n\n\n\n      10\n        During oral argument, the parties identified a number of State programs that are\nbeing developed that will be available to the KCMSD, but these programs have not yet\nhad a significant impact on the district.\n\n                                         -31-\n\famount that has been available to the KCMSD for a number of years. Should\nthis loss of funding occur, it would present a changed circumstance that\ncould call for reconsideration of the agreement.\n\n                                          E.\n\n      The Jenkins Class argues that the State cannot be dismissed because\nit is both a constitutional violator and a defendant subject to joint and\nseveral liability.    The district court has concluded that the State's\nliability as constitutional violator will be satisfied by the payments\ncalled for in the settlement. It has amended the remedy with regard to\njoint and several liability.11 Although the agreement contemplates the\ndismissal of the State in the future, the KCMSD will nevertheless remain\nsubject to court supervision as a constitutional violator liable to the\nconstitutional victims. The KCMSD has not sought a declaration of unitary\nstatus with respect to any part of its operations. The effect of the\nagreement is that the KCMSD now bears sole responsibility for implementing\nthe desegregation remedy and obtaining the funding necessary to do so.\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        We have considered, and now reject, the Jenkins Class's other arguments in\nopposition to the agreement. The Class analogizes the agreement to a contract and\ncontends that it cannot be bound by a contract to which it is not a party. Regardless\nof the agreement, the district court's order is not akin to a contract. The Class\npresented its objections to the district court, those objections were overruled, and the\nClass is now bound by that order to the same extent as any other court order in this\ncase.\n\n       The Class also argues that the district court erred in approving the agreement\nbecause: (1) the court was not presented with a justiciable controversy; (2) the order\nis invalid as an advisory opinion; and (3) the agreement cannot be viewed as an\nalternative remedy plan because the State did not seek declaratory relief. These\narguments must fail based on our holding that the court's approval of the agreement was\nan exercise of its continuing equitable authority to devise and implement a remedy in\nthis case.\n\n                                         -32-\n\f      In the district court's order approving the settlement, the court\nexpressed concerns about the KCMSD's management, including its top-heavy\nadministration. 959 F. Supp. at 1175-77. The court acknowledged that the\nKCMSD has made significant progress in the face of substantial obstacles,\nnot the least of which has been the ever-shifting leadership in the KCMSD\nadministration.     Id. at 1173.       There have been ten         district\nsuperintendents in the last nine years. Id. The district court made plain\nthat it was simply making observations, and not findings of fact, and that\nits observations played no role in its decision to approve the agreement.\nWe find instructive, however, the court's identification of areas in which\nthe district's performance has been \"dismal at best.\" Id. These include:\n(1) the KCMSD still lacks a comprehensive integrated educational and\ninstructional plan; (2) the KCMSD's fragmented efforts to implement\nmeaningful staff development measures have fallen far short of the mark;\n(3) ongoing administrative instability has plagued the KCMSD for years,\nresulting in a lack of accountability for deficiencies; (4) the KCMSD still\nlacks a security plan; and (5) the KCMSD is unable to produce a budget for\na particular fiscal year and reconcile it with actual expenditures for\nspecific line items. Id. at 1173-74.\n\n      The district judge making these observations, Judge Russell Clark,\nhas presided over this litigation from its inception in 1977 until his\ndecision to withdraw following issuance of the order which we now review.\nIn that twenty-year period, this case was consistently before the court,\nand Judge Clark's extensive knowledge of conditions in the district has\ncome the hard way, through numerous hearings. His observations point to\nthe nature of the problems facing the district and sharply contrast with\nthe type of operation described by Dr. Murphy in his testimony. Needless\nto say, these problems are substantial obstacles to the KCMSD's satisfying\nits obligation to provide quality education.        These obstacles are a\nchallenge to the KCMSD's management, and also impose a heavy duty on the\ndistrict court to closely supervise and monitor the KCMSD management.\nThus, in entering into this agreement, the KCMSD may well have brought upon\nitself a circumstance that will subject it to more, rather than less,\njudicial\n\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fsupervision, particularly during the transition period of the next three\nto four years, and until the vestiges of segregation have been eliminated\nto the extent practicable.\n\n      The district court stated that the KCMSD's administration was not up\nto the task of eliminating the remaining vestiges within the short time\nrequired by the court. It expressed the view that a strong hand with\neducational expertise and no \"vested interest\" was essential to accomplish\nthe difficult goals in this transitory period. Id. at 1178. We have\nreferred to the refusal of the court's request that Dr. Bartman and DESE\nplay a role in this respect. The district court stated that in this event\nit would consider appointment of a special master to oversee the KCMSD and\nurged that time was of the essence. We are in full agreement that on\nremand the district court should promptly consider the issue of appropriate\nsupervision over the district. The deficiencies outlined by the district\ncourt which we have discussed above and achievement of the goal of\nattaining unitary status are difficult and complex. We agree with the\ndistrict court that this is attainable, but it will require skillful and\ncomplex administrative and management effort. We leave to the discretion\nof the district court how best to exercise its oversight. Time is short,\nand the district court must do what is necessary to assure that the goals\nare achieved.\n\n      We affirm in all respects the district court's statements concerning\nthe transition leading to return of the district to local control. The\ngoal is to eliminate, to the extent practicable, the vestiges of\ndiscrimination in this school district, and the district court should spare\nno effort in ensuring that this goal is reached.\n\n      Many aspects of the agreement and its effects are troublesome, and\nwe remain deeply concerned about the future of the KCMSD.      The issue of\nwhether the district court erred in approving the agreement is a close one.\n Nevertheless, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in its\nfactual findings regarding the agreement, nor that it abused its discretion\nin approving the agreement and, in effect, modifying the earlier remedy\nordered by the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fWe thus affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nA true copy.\n\n     Attest:\n\n           CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                            -35-\n\f</pre>",
