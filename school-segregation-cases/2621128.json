Here, in responding to allegations of discrimination arising from an inter-group squabble\n\fover the type of meal to be served to a group member's allergic child, the Commission exceeded\nits authority because the alleged discriminatory practice did not relate to education, a statutory\nprerequisite for the Commission's exercise of authority.\n\n        Fishers Adolescent Catholic Enrichment Society, Inc. (FACES)1 was formed in 2006 by\ntwo Catholic mothers. At the time this dispute arose, FACES was comprised of a group of a\ndozen or so families who had associated together \"to provide homeschool high schoolers with\nCatholic educational, spiritual, and social enrichment.\" Record Vols. 4, 6 at 431, 988. These op-\nportunities included classes in academic subject matter as well as a Right to Life March and so-\ncial events such as paintball and laser tag, ski trips, and holiday parties. Record Vol. 12 at 255.\nFACES accepts members from varying faiths, although, at the time this action was brought, only\ntwo of the eleven families and one instructor was non-Catholic. Record Vols. 4, 12 at 431, 257\nand 259.\n\n\n        In fall 2008, FACES planned an \"All Souls' Day Masquerade Ball\" dinner-dance social\nevent to coincide with the Catholic feast day of All Souls' Day on November 2.2 FACES's intent,\nmotivated by an article in the National Catholic Register, was \"to put the focus on [their] Catho-\nlic holidays as opposed to the focus of Halloween.\" Record Vols. 4, 5 at 443, 694. In planning\nthe event, a FACES member parent, Mrs. Bridgewater, requested special dietary accommoda-\ntions for her daughter who planned to attend. Her daughter suffers from a dietary condition that\ncan cause a life-threatening allergic reaction in which her ability to breathe and swallow would\nbe impaired or even stopped altogether if she ate certain foods including chicken. When Mrs.\nBridgewater learned that the menu for the dinner-dance included chicken, she requested that her\ndaughter be served a steak. After FACES declined that request, Mrs. Bridgewater again re-\nquested a steak, offering to pay the price difference, or in the alternative, a hamburger. FACES\ndenied that request as well but granted Mrs. Bridgewater's subsequent request to permit her\ndaughter to bring her own dinner, although there would be no ticket-price adjustment to account\nfor her daughter not needing the included dinner. The dispute continued. On October 8, 2008,\n\n        1\n          Fishers Adolescent Catholic Enrichment Society, Inc. is registered as an Indiana non-profit cor-\nporation and recognized under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n        2\n          All Souls Day is a solemn feast in the Roman Catholic Church commemorating all of those who\nhave died. It is celebrated annually on November 2. Francis Mershman, All Souls' Day, 1 THE CATHOLIC\nENCYCLOPEDIA (Robert Appleton Co. 1907), available at http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01315b.htm.\n                                                    2\n\fMrs. Bridgewater changed her mind and made another request that her daughter be served a beef\nmeal prepared by the event venue, but was again rebuffed. The next day, Mrs. Bridgewater on\nbehalf of her daughter, filed a complaint with the Commission, alleging FACES refused a rea-\nsonable accommodation for her daughter and therefore discriminated against her due to her disa-\nbility. Ultimately, even although FACES had instructed her not to contact the event venue, Mrs.\nBridgewater made arrangements with the event venue for her daughter to be served a separate\nmeal, which she paid for. Her daughter attended the dinner-dance without incident, but four days\nlater on November 6, FACES expelled the Bridgewater family. Mrs. Bridgewater then filed a\nsecond complaint with the Commission, alleging FACES expelled the Bridgewater family in un-\nlawful retaliation for filing the disability discrimination claim.\n\n\n       FACES filed a motion to dismiss both the claims on the basis that the Commission did\nnot have subject-matter jurisdiction over FACES under Indiana's Civil Rights Law because\nFACES was a religious organization—not an educational one as Mrs. Bridgewater claimed. Af-\nter a hearing, an administrative law judge for the Commission denied the motion to dismiss on\nthe ground that the Commission had jurisdiction because FACES as a group related to education.\nThe Commission affirmed and consolidated the disability and retaliatory discrimination claims\nfor further proceedings. The administrative law judge later entered an order with findings of fact\nand conclusions of law, concluding that FACES did not commit an unlawful discriminatory prac-\ntice because it had provided a reasonable accommodation for Mrs. Bridgewater's daughter's die-\ntary needs—but that FACES did commit an unlawful discriminatory practice when it expelled\nthe Bridgewater children after they filed the disability discrimination complaint. The administra-\ntive law judge ruled that Mrs. Bridgewater's daughter should be awarded $5,000 in damages and\nthat FACES should take corrective action. Order, Appellant's App'x at 523. Both parties ap-\npealed the order to the Commission. FACES challenged the administrative law judge's conclu-\nsions regarding jurisdiction, retaliation, and corrective action. The Bridgewaters challenged the\nadministrative law judge's conclusions regarding the disability accommodation and damages.\nThe Commission issued its final order, incorporating the administrative law judge's rulings in all\nrespects, except for reducing damages.\n\n\n       FACES appealed, and Mrs. Bridgewater cross-appealed. The Court of Appeals affirmed\n\n                                                   3\n\fin part and reversed in part. See Fishers Adolescent Catholic Enrichment Soc'y, Inc. v. Bridge-\nwater ex rel. Bridgewater, 990 N.E.2d 29, 49 (Ind. Ct. App. 2013), trans. granted, vacated. The\nCourt of Appeals reversed the Commission's order requiring FACES to post a link to the Com-\nmission's final order on numerous websites but affirmed the Commission's order in all other re-\nspects. Id. Having previously granted transfer, we address FACES's dispositive claim that the\nCommission lacked authority to take any action other than the dismissal of the disability and re-\ntaliatory discrimination claims.\n\n\n        The Legislature may delegate authority to an administrative agency through a valid stat-\nute that sets out a reasonable standard to guide that discretion, but the agency exercises such au-\nthority subject to the confines of its enabling statute. Stanton v. Smith, 429 N.E.2d 224, 228\n(Ind. 1981). Such limiting standard may be found \"within the four corners of the statute itself or\ncan be found within other statutes that apply to the conduct and authority of the administrative\nunit.\" Id. The Commission's authority is limited by the Administrative Orders and Procedures\nAct, and this Court must grant relief if we determine that \"a person seeking judicial relief has\nbeen prejudiced by an agency action that is . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or\nlimitations.\" Ind. Code § 4-21.5-5-14(d)(3).\n\n\n        The Indiana Civil Rights Law explicitly conditions the Commission's exercise of its en-\nforcement powers to incidents where a person has \"engaged in an unlawful discriminatory prac-\ntice.\" Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(j)3 (emphasis added). To be \"unlawful\" under the Law, the discrimi-\nnatory practice must relate to \"the acquisition or sale of real estate, education, public accommo-\ndations, employment, or the extending of credit.\" Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(l) (emphasis added). As\nto these enumerated prerequisite criteria for Commission action, it is only \"education\" that is the\nclaimed basis of Mrs. Bridgewater's discrimination claims.\n\n\n        There is no factual dispute that the purpose of FACES, as described in its bylaws, is \"to\nprovide homeschool high schoolers with Catholic educational, spiritual, and social enrichment.\"\n\n\n        3\n          This opinion cites Indiana Code subsections 22-9-1-6(g), (j), and (l) as identified in the 2014\ncodification. These subsections were previously designated as (h), (k), and (m) and renumbered in 2012\nand 2014 with no change in substance.\n\n                                                    4\n\fRecord Vol. 6 at 988; see also Record Vol. 12 at 231 (\"FACE[S] achieves [its] religious mission\nby shaping its activities to foster the development of homeschooling families in a manner con-\nsistent with the teaching of the Catholic Church on matters of faith and morals.\"); Record Vol.\n12 at 234 (\"The intent of FACES is to provide Catholic homeschooling families with fraternal\nsupport and solidarity as Catholic families try to raise their children in light of the Catholic\nfaith.\"). As these statements of purpose imply, the predominant purpose of FACES is to promote\nand foster its member families' Catholic faith in various aspects of their childrens' lives; educa-\ntion is but one aspect. The dinner-dance at which Mrs. Bridgewater contends that FACES failed\nto accommodate her daughter's food allergy furthered the FACES members' objective of provid-\ning Catholic spiritual and social enrichment. It was not an occasion for the teaching of academic\nsubjects as part of the student's curriculum. FACES planned the \"All Souls' Day Masquerade\nBall\" dinner-dance social event to coincide with the Catholic feast day of All Souls' Day on No-\nvember 2. The alleged disability discrimination thus occurred at a quasi-religious social func-\ntion, not an educational one. To expansively interpret \"relating to . . . education,\" see Ind. Code\n§ 22-9-1-3(l), to apply to this dinner would convert almost every occasion of parental guidance\nand training into an activity \"related to education.\" This would eviscerate the function of \"re-\nlated to education\" as a legislative prerequisite for the Commission's enforcement powers.\n\n\n       Because the alleged discriminatory practice in this case does not relate to education, Mrs.\nBridgewater's claim of disability discrimination fell outside the statutory authority of the Com-\nmission. It likewise follows that the Commission also lacked authority to find that \"FACES\ncommitted an unlawful discriminatory practice when it expelled the Bridgewater family because\nof the filing of the original complaint,\" Conclusion of Law No. 14, Appellant's App'x at 522, and\nordered the imposition of remedial sanctions against FACES. The Commission's statutory power\nto \"prevent any person from discharging, expelling, or otherwise discriminating against any other\nperson because the person filed a complaint,\" Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(g), is necessarily limited by\nIndiana Code section 22-9-1-6(j), which preconditions the Commission's power to act to inci-\ndents where a person has \"engaged in an unlawful discriminatory practice.\" Ind. Code\n§ 22-9-1-6(j) (emphasis added); see also § 22-9-1-6(l). As discussed above, under the facts of\nthis case, any unlawful discriminatory practice must be related to education. Here, the claim of\nretaliatory discrimination is predicated on Mrs. Bridgewater's assertion of a claim that the failure\n\n                                                  5\n\fto provide special food constituted disability discrimination. Because this disability discrimina-\ntion claim is not related to education and thus falls outside the Commission's enforcement pow-\ners, the derivative retaliatory discrimination claim is also beyond the Commission's authority to\nimpose any remedial sanctions against FACES. This is particularly apparent from the four cor-\nners of the Indiana Civil Rights Law. Neither the disability discrimination claim nor the retalia-\ntory discrimination claim are related to education, and thus the Commission has exceeded its\nstatutory authority.\n\n\n       Furthermore, it bears noting that the statutory language authorizing Commission action to\nremedy an alleged retaliatory discrimination should not be expansively construed to expand the\npowers of the Commission beyond the types of discrimination expressly enumerated in the Law.\nTo hold otherwise would invite and incentivize the intimidating technique of bootstrapping a re-\ntaliation claim onto a meritless complaint alleging discrimination not subject to the Law. See\nInd. Code § 22-9-1-2.\n\n\n       \"It is 'the duty of the court not to enter upon the consideration of a constitutional question\nwhere the court can perceive another ground on which it may properly rest its decision.'\" Bayh\nv. Sonnenburg, 573 N.E.2d 398, 402 (Ind. 1991) (quoting Bureau of Motor Vehicles v. Scott,\n497 N.E.2d 557, 559 (Ind. 1986)). Because the Commission lacked statutory authority to act\nupon both the disability discrimination claim and the claim of exclusion from membership in re-\ntaliation for asserting the disability discrimination claim, both claims should have been dismissed\nas exceeding the authority of the Commission, and it is therefore unnecessary to address any fur-\nther issues, constitutional or otherwise.\n\n\n       In this case, the Commission considered the merits of Mrs. Bridgewater's disability dis-\ncrimination claim but dismissed this claim after determining that FACES \"met its burden of\nmaking a reasonable accommodation . . . by agreeing to allow food to be brought from home.\"\nConclusion of Law No. 8, Appellant's App'x at 521. As to the retaliation discrimination claim,\nthe Commission found that FACES committed an unlawful discriminatory practice and ordered\nremedial sanctions. The Commission's consideration of the merits of either discrimination claim\nwas clearly erroneous because both claims fell outside the Commission's statutory authority and\n\n                                                 6\n\fthus should have been dismissed outright. See Ind. Code § 4-21.5-5-14(d); Regester v. Ind. State\nBd. of Nursing, 703 N.E.2d 147, 151 (Ind. 1998) (stating that a reviewing court may vacate an\nadministrative board's decision when \"the conclusions reached by the board are clearly errone-\nous\").\n\n\n                                            Conclusion\n\n\n         The Commission lacked authority to take any action other than the dismissal of these\nclaims arising from an intra-group squabble over the type of meal to be served to a member fam-\nily's child at an \"All Souls' Day Masquerade Ball\" dinner-dance social event—an incident not re-\nlated to education and thus not within the Commission's prerequisite statutory authority. We va-\ncate the Commission's final order and remand this cause with instructions to grant the motion to\ndismiss filed by FACES as to both claims.\n\n\n\n\nRush, C.J., and David and Massa, JJ., concur.\nRucker, J., dissents in part with separate opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fRucker, J., dissenting in part.\n\n\n       I agree with the majority that the Bridgewater disability discrimination claim fails because\nthe alleged discriminatory practice—excluding one of the Bridgewater children from a meal at the\nMasquerade Ball due to her disability—did not “relat[e] . . . to education” within the meaning of\nIndiana’s Civil Rights Act. Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(l). However, I disagree that the Bridgewater\nretaliation claim is somehow derivative of and thus depends upon the disposition of the discrimi-\nnation claim. Therefore on this issue I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n       Indiana’s Civil Rights Act reflects the State’s public policy to:\n               provide all of its citizens equal opportunity for education,\n               employment, access to public conveniences and accommodations,\n               and acquisition through purchase or rental of real property,\n               including but not limited to housing, and to eliminate segregation or\n               separation based solely on race, religion, color, sex, disability,\n               national origin or ancestry, since such segregation is an impediment\n               to equal opportunity. . . . The practice of denying these rights to\n               properly qualified persons by reason of the race, religion, color, sex,\n               disability, national origin, or ancestry of such person is contrary to\n               the principles of freedom and equality of opportunity and is a burden\n               to the objectives of the public policy of this state and shall be\n               considered as discriminatory practices.\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-2(a), (b). The Indiana Civil Rights Commission was created under the auspices of\nthe Civil Rights Act and is afforded certain authority and charged with certain responsibilities,\nincluding the responsibility to “receive and investigate complaints alleging discriminatory\npractices” and to “prevent any person from discharging, expelling, or otherwise discriminating\nagainst any other person because the person filed a complaint, testified in any hearing before this\ncommission, or in any way assisted the commission in any matter under its investigation.” I.C. §\n22-9-1-6(d), (g).\n\n\n       The majority takes the position that because the activities at issue did not “relate to\neducation” the Commission had no authority to do anything other than dismiss the Bridgewater\ncomplaint. I cannot agree. Importantly, the Act prohibits “any person” from engaging in acts of\ndiscrimination. I.C. § 22-9-1-6(g). And a person is defined in part as “one (1) or more individuals,\n\fpartnerships, associations, organizations, limited liability companies, corporations, labor\norganizations . . . and other organized groups of persons.” I.C. § 22-9-1-3(a). FACES certainly\nfalls within the definition of the Act. To be sure there is a carve-out for certain employers. For\nexample although the Act makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against its employee,\nexcluded from the definition of “employer” is “any school, educational, or charitable religious\ninstitution owned or conducted by or affiliated with a church or religious institution.” I.C. § 22-\n9-1-3(h)(2). But the assertion here is not a claim based on employment discrimination. And in\nany case FACES does not contend it was acting as an employer with respect to Mrs. Bridgewater’s\ndaughter.1\n\n\n        Further, the import of the majority’s holding is that retaliation is only a “discriminatory\npractice” when it is committed in response to the filing of a meritorious complaint with the\nCommission. I make two observations: First, correctly noting this is a matter of first impression,\nthe Court of Appeals concluded “FACES is sufficiently related to education such that the ICRC’s\njurisdiction is proper.” Fishers Adolescent Catholic Enrichment Soc’y, Inc. v. Bridgewater, 990\nN.E.2d 29, 41 (Ind. Ct. App. 2013), vacated. And although the Court disagrees with our colleagues\non this point, a respectable argument can be made that a good education is not composed solely of\n“the three Rs—reading, [‘]riting, and [‘]rithmetic.”2 Rather, it also includes social skills.3 In\nessence, one could reach the reasonable conclusion that the meal at the Ball “relates to education”\nand thus the Bridgewater complaint falls with the plain wording of the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\n        The facts of this case make clear the Bridgewater complaint was certainly not “meritless”\nas the majority contends. And the Commission was quite correct in entertaining and providing a\n\n\n\n        1\n          The majority seems to imply that the homeschooling/religious character of FACES exempts the\norganization from the reach of Indiana’s Civil Rights Act. See slip op. at 4-5. It does not, although the\nLegislature could certainly do so if deemed appropriate.\n        2\n            Christine Ammer, The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms 457 (2d ed. 2013).\n        3\n          See Ind. Dep’t of Educ., Indiana Academic Standards for Health & Wellness 79 (2010), available\nat www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/standards/health-and-wellness/2010_health_education_standards_literacy.pdf\n(“Students will demonstrate the ability to use interpersonal communication skills to enhance health and\navoid or reduce health risks. . . . This standard focuses on how responsible individuals use verbal and non-\nverbal skills to develop and maintain healthy personal relationships.”).\n\n                                                       2\n\fremedy in favor of the Bridgewaters when FACES expelled the family in retaliation for filing the\ncomplaint in the first place. Second, the retaliation language in the statute itself says nothing about\nan alleged “meritorious” complaint. Instead it tasks the Commission with the responsibility of\n“investigat[ing] complaints alleging discriminatory practices” and giving it authority to prevent\nretaliation “because the person filed a complaint, testified in any hearing before this commission,\nor in any way assisted the commission in any matter under its investigation.” I.C. § 22-9-1-6(d),\n(g) (emphases added).\n\n\n        In addition, the majority’s view is also inconsistent Federal retaliation precedent.4 In the\nfederal context, all that is required for a complainant to succeed on a retaliation claim is that he or\nshe reasonably believed in good faith that the complained-of practice was discriminatory. See,\ne.g., Fine v. Ryan Int’l Airlines, 305 F.3d 746, 752 (7th Cir. 2002) (even where district court found\ncomplainant’s discrimination claim failed as a matter of law, she could still prevail on her\nretaliation claim); Wilkins v. St. Louis Hous. Auth., 314 F.3d 927, 933 (8th Cir. 2002) (recognizing\nthat the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have all used a reasonable-belief standard in the\nTitle VII retaliation context).\n\n\n        Essentially, retaliation under the Act is a separate act of discrimination regardless of the\noutcome on the merits of the underlying complaint. Thus even though FACES prevailed on\nBridgewater’s disability discrimination claim, it was nonetheless subject to the Bridgewater\nretaliation discrimination claim. See Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 180-81\n(2005) (recognizing that the objective of preventing discriminatory practices “would be difficult,\nif not impossible, to achieve if persons who complain about . . . discrimination did not have\neffective protection against retaliation. . . . Without protection from retaliation, individuals who\nwitness discrimination would likely not report it . . . and the underlying discrimination would go\nunremedied” (internal quotation omitted)).\n\n\n\n\n        4\n          “In construing Indiana civil rights law our courts have often looked to federal law for guidance.”\nFilter Specialists, Inc. v.

Here, in responding to allegations of discrimination arising from an inter-group squabble\n\fover the type of meal to be served to a group member's allergic child, the Commission exceeded\nits authority because the alleged discriminatory practice did not relate to education, a statutory\nprerequisite for the Commission's exercise of authority.\n\n        Fishers Adolescent Catholic Enrichment Society, Inc. (FACES)1 was formed in 2006 by\ntwo Catholic mothers. At the time this dispute arose, FACES was comprised of a group of a\ndozen or so families who had associated together \"to provide homeschool high schoolers with\nCatholic educational, spiritual, and social enrichment.\" Record Vols. 4, 6 at 431, 988. These op-\nportunities included classes in academic subject matter as well as a Right to Life March and so-\ncial events such as paintball and laser tag, ski trips, and holiday parties. Record Vol. 12 at 255.\nFACES accepts members from varying faiths, although, at the time this action was brought, only\ntwo of the eleven families and one instructor was non-Catholic. Record Vols. 4, 12 at 431, 257\nand 259.\n\n\n        In fall 2008, FACES planned an \"All Souls' Day Masquerade Ball\" dinner-dance social\nevent to coincide with the Catholic feast day of All Souls' Day on November 2.2 FACES's intent,\nmotivated by an article in the National Catholic Register, was \"to put the focus on [their] Catho-\nlic holidays as opposed to the focus of Halloween.\" Record Vols. 4, 5 at 443, 694. In planning\nthe event, a FACES member parent, Mrs. Bridgewater, requested special dietary accommoda-\ntions for her daughter who planned to attend. Her daughter suffers from a dietary condition that\ncan cause a life-threatening allergic reaction in which her ability to breathe and swallow would\nbe impaired or even stopped altogether if she ate certain foods including chicken. When Mrs.\nBridgewater learned that the menu for the dinner-dance included chicken, she requested that her\ndaughter be served a steak. After FACES declined that request, Mrs. Bridgewater again re-\nquested a steak, offering to pay the price difference, or in the alternative, a hamburger. FACES\ndenied that request as well but granted Mrs. Bridgewater's subsequent request to permit her\ndaughter to bring her own dinner, although there would be no ticket-price adjustment to account\nfor her daughter not needing the included dinner. The dispute continued. On October 8, 2008,\n\n        1\n          Fishers Adolescent Catholic Enrichment Society, Inc. is registered as an Indiana non-profit cor-\nporation and recognized under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n        2\n          All Souls Day is a solemn feast in the Roman Catholic Church commemorating all of those who\nhave died. It is celebrated annually on November 2. Francis Mershman, All Souls' Day, 1 THE CATHOLIC\nENCYCLOPEDIA (Robert Appleton Co. 1907), available at http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01315b.htm.\n                                                    2\n\fMrs. Bridgewater changed her mind and made another request that her daughter be served a beef\nmeal prepared by the event venue, but was again rebuffed. The next day, Mrs. Bridgewater on\nbehalf of her daughter, filed a complaint with the Commission, alleging FACES refused a rea-\nsonable accommodation for her daughter and therefore discriminated against her due to her disa-\nbility. Ultimately, even although FACES had instructed her not to contact the event venue, Mrs.\nBridgewater made arrangements with the event venue for her daughter to be served a separate\nmeal, which she paid for. Her daughter attended the dinner-dance without incident, but four days\nlater on November 6, FACES expelled the Bridgewater family. Mrs. Bridgewater then filed a\nsecond complaint with the Commission, alleging FACES expelled the Bridgewater family in un-\nlawful retaliation for filing the disability discrimination claim.\n\n\n       FACES filed a motion to dismiss both the claims on the basis that the Commission did\nnot have subject-matter jurisdiction over FACES under Indiana's Civil Rights Law because\nFACES was a religious organization—not an educational one as Mrs. Bridgewater claimed. Af-\nter a hearing, an administrative law judge for the Commission denied the motion to dismiss on\nthe ground that the Commission had jurisdiction because FACES as a group related to education.\nThe Commission affirmed and consolidated the disability and retaliatory discrimination claims\nfor further proceedings. The administrative law judge later entered an order with findings of fact\nand conclusions of law, concluding that FACES did not commit an unlawful discriminatory prac-\ntice because it had provided a reasonable accommodation for Mrs. Bridgewater's daughter's die-\ntary needs—but that FACES did commit an unlawful discriminatory practice when it expelled\nthe Bridgewater children after they filed the disability discrimination complaint. The administra-\ntive law judge ruled that Mrs. Bridgewater's daughter should be awarded $5,000 in damages and\nthat FACES should take corrective action. Order, Appellant's App'x at 523. Both parties ap-\npealed the order to the Commission. FACES challenged the administrative law judge's conclu-\nsions regarding jurisdiction, retaliation, and corrective action. The Bridgewaters challenged the\nadministrative law judge's conclusions regarding the disability accommodation and damages.\nThe Commission issued its final order, incorporating the administrative law judge's rulings in all\nrespects, except for reducing damages.\n\n\n       FACES appealed, and Mrs. Bridgewater cross-appealed. The Court of Appeals affirmed\n\n                                                   3\n\fin part and reversed in part. See Fishers Adolescent Catholic Enrichment Soc'y, Inc. v. Bridge-\nwater ex rel.

Such limiting standard may be found \"within the four corners of the statute itself or\ncan be found within other statutes that apply to the conduct and authority of the administrative\nunit.\" Id. The Commission's authority is limited by the Administrative Orders and Procedures\nAct, and this Court must grant relief if we determine that \"a person seeking judicial relief has\nbeen prejudiced by an agency action that is . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or\nlimitations.\" Ind. Code § 4-21.5-5-14(d)(3).\n\n\n        The Indiana Civil Rights Law explicitly conditions the Commission's exercise of its en-\nforcement powers to incidents where a person has \"engaged in an unlawful discriminatory prac-\ntice.\" Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(j)3 (emphasis added). To be \"unlawful\" under the Law, the discrimi-\nnatory practice must relate to \"the acquisition or sale of real estate, education, public accommo-\ndations, employment, or the extending of credit.\" Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(l) (emphasis added). As\nto these enumerated prerequisite criteria for Commission action, it is only \"education\" that is the\nclaimed basis of Mrs. Bridgewater's discrimination claims.\n\n\n        There is no factual dispute that the purpose of FACES, as described in its bylaws, is \"to\nprovide homeschool high schoolers with Catholic educational, spiritual, and social enrichment.\"\n\n\n        3\n          This opinion cites Indiana Code subsections 22-9-1-6(g), (j), and (l) as identified in the 2014\ncodification. These subsections were previously designated as (h), (k), and (m) and renumbered in 2012\nand 2014 with no change in substance.\n\n                                                    4\n\fRecord Vol. 6 at 988; see also Record Vol. 12 at 231 (\"FACE[S] achieves [its] religious mission\nby shaping its activities to foster the development of homeschooling families in a manner con-\nsistent with the teaching of the Catholic Church on matters of faith and morals.\"); Record Vol.\n12 at 234 (\"The intent of FACES is to provide Catholic homeschooling families with fraternal\nsupport and solidarity as Catholic families try to raise their children in light of the Catholic\nfaith.\"). As these statements of purpose imply, the predominant purpose of FACES is to promote\nand foster its member families' Catholic faith in various aspects of their childrens' lives; educa-\ntion is but one aspect. The dinner-dance at which Mrs. Bridgewater contends that FACES failed\nto accommodate her daughter's food allergy furthered the FACES members' objective of provid-\ning Catholic spiritual and social enrichment. It was not an occasion for the teaching of academic\nsubjects as part of the student's curriculum. FACES planned the \"All Souls' Day Masquerade\nBall\" dinner-dance social event to coincide with the Catholic feast day of All Souls' Day on No-\nvember 2. The alleged disability discrimination thus occurred at a quasi-religious social func-\ntion, not an educational one. To expansively interpret \"relating to . . . education,\" see Ind. Code\n§ 22-9-1-3(l), to apply to this dinner would convert almost every occasion of parental guidance\nand training into an activity \"related to education.\" This would eviscerate the function of \"re-\nlated to education\" as a legislative prerequisite for the Commission's enforcement powers.\n\n\n       Because the alleged discriminatory practice in this case does not relate to education, Mrs.\nBridgewater's claim of disability discrimination fell outside the statutory authority of the Com-\nmission. It likewise follows that the Commission also lacked authority to find that \"FACES\ncommitted an unlawful discriminatory practice when it expelled the Bridgewater family because\nof the filing of the original complaint,\" Conclusion of Law No. 14, Appellant's App'x at 522, and\nordered the imposition of remedial sanctions against FACES. The Commission's statutory power\nto \"prevent any person from discharging, expelling, or otherwise discriminating against any other\nperson because the person filed a complaint,\" Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(g), is necessarily limited by\nIndiana Code section 22-9-1-6(j), which preconditions the Commission's power to act to inci-\ndents where a person has \"engaged in an unlawful discriminatory practice.\" Ind. Code\n§ 22-9-1-6(j) (emphasis added); see also § 22-9-1-6(l). As discussed above, under the facts of\nthis case, any unlawful discriminatory practice must be related to education. Here, the claim of\nretaliatory discrimination is predicated on Mrs. Bridgewater's assertion of a claim that the failure\n\n                                                  5\n\fto provide special food constituted disability discrimination. Because this disability discrimina-\ntion claim is not related to education and thus falls outside the Commission's enforcement pow-\ners, the derivative retaliatory discrimination claim is also beyond the Commission's authority to\nimpose any remedial sanctions against FACES. This is particularly apparent from the four cor-\nners of the Indiana Civil Rights Law. Neither the disability discrimination claim nor the retalia-\ntory discrimination claim are related to education, and thus the Commission has exceeded its\nstatutory authority.\n\n\n       Furthermore, it bears noting that the statutory language authorizing Commission action to\nremedy an alleged retaliatory discrimination should not be expansively construed to expand the\npowers of the Commission beyond the types of discrimination expressly enumerated in the Law.\nTo hold otherwise would invite and incentivize the intimidating technique of bootstrapping a re-\ntaliation claim onto a meritless complaint alleging discrimination not subject to the Law. See\nInd. Code § 22-9-1-2.\n\n\n       \"It is 'the duty of the court not to enter upon the consideration of a constitutional question\nwhere the court can perceive another ground on which it may properly rest its decision.'\" Bayh\nv.

Because the Commission lacked statutory authority to act\nupon both the disability discrimination claim and the claim of exclusion from membership in re-\ntaliation for asserting the disability discrimination claim, both claims should have been dismissed\nas exceeding the authority of the Commission, and it is therefore unnecessary to address any fur-\nther issues, constitutional or otherwise.\n\n\n       In this case, the Commission considered the merits of Mrs. Bridgewater's disability dis-\ncrimination claim but dismissed this claim after determining that FACES \"met its burden of\nmaking a reasonable accommodation . . . by agreeing to allow food to be brought from home.\"\nConclusion of Law No. 8, Appellant's App'x at 521. As to the retaliation discrimination claim,\nthe Commission found that FACES committed an unlawful discriminatory practice and ordered\nremedial sanctions. The Commission's consideration of the merits of either discrimination claim\nwas clearly erroneous because both claims fell outside the Commission's statutory authority and\n\n                                                 6\n\fthus should have been dismissed outright.

Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(l). However, I disagree that the Bridgewater\nretaliation claim is somehow derivative of and thus depends upon the disposition of the discrimi-\nnation claim. Therefore on this issue I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n       Indiana’s Civil Rights Act reflects the State’s public policy to:\n               provide all of its citizens equal opportunity for education,\n               employment, access to public conveniences and accommodations,\n               and acquisition through purchase or rental of real property,\n               including but not limited to housing, and to eliminate segregation or\n               separation based solely on race, religion, color, sex, disability,\n               national origin or ancestry, since such segregation is an impediment\n               to equal opportunity. . . . The practice of denying these rights to\n               properly qualified persons by reason of the race, religion, color, sex,\n               disability, national origin, or ancestry of such person is contrary to\n               the principles of freedom and equality of opportunity and is a burden\n               to the objectives of the public policy of this state and shall be\n               considered as discriminatory practices.\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-2(a), (b). The Indiana Civil Rights Commission was created under the auspices of\nthe Civil Rights Act and is afforded certain authority and charged with certain responsibilities,\nincluding the responsibility to “receive and investigate complaints alleging discriminatory\npractices” and to “prevent any person from discharging, expelling, or otherwise discriminating\nagainst any other person because the person filed a complaint, testified in any hearing before this\ncommission, or in any way assisted the commission in any matter under its investigation.” I.C. §\n22-9-1-6(d), (g).\n\n\n       The majority takes the position that because the activities at issue did not “relate to\neducation” the Commission had no authority to do anything other than dismiss the Bridgewater\ncomplaint. I cannot agree. Importantly, the Act prohibits “any person” from engaging in acts of\ndiscrimination. I.C. § 22-9-1-6(g). And a person is defined in part as “one (1) or more individuals,\n\fpartnerships, associations, organizations, limited liability companies, corporations, labor\norganizations . . . and other organized groups of persons.” I.C. § 22-9-1-3(a). FACES certainly\nfalls within the definition of the Act. To be sure there is a carve-out for certain employers. For\nexample although the Act makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against its employee,\nexcluded from the definition of “employer” is “any school, educational, or charitable religious\ninstitution owned or conducted by or affiliated with a church or religious institution.” I.C. § 22-\n9-1-3(h)(2). But the assertion here is not a claim based on employment discrimination. And in\nany case FACES does not contend it was acting as an employer with respect to Mrs. Bridgewater’s\ndaughter.1\n\n\n        Further, the import of the majority’s holding is that retaliation is only a “discriminatory\npractice” when it is committed in response to the filing of a meritorious complaint with the\nCommission. I make two observations: First, correctly noting this is a matter of first impression,\nthe Court of Appeals concluded “FACES is sufficiently related to education such that the ICRC’s\njurisdiction is proper.” Fishers Adolescent Catholic Enrichment Soc’y, Inc. v. Bridgewater, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (Ind. Ct.

And although the Court disagrees with our colleagues\non this point, a respectable argument can be made that a good education is not composed solely of\n“the three Rs—reading, [‘]riting, and [‘]rithmetic.”2 Rather, it also includes social skills.3 In\nessence, one could reach the reasonable conclusion that the meal at the Ball “relates to education”\nand thus the Bridgewater complaint falls with the plain wording of the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\n        The facts of this case make clear the Bridgewater complaint was certainly not “meritless”\nas the majority contends. And the Commission was quite correct in entertaining and providing a\n\n\n\n        1\n          The majority seems to imply that the homeschooling/religious character of FACES exempts the\norganization from the reach of Indiana’s Civil Rights Act.

Second, the retaliation language in the statute itself says nothing about\nan alleged “meritorious” complaint. Instead it tasks the Commission with the responsibility of\n“investigat[ing] complaints alleging discriminatory practices” and giving it authority to prevent\nretaliation “because the person filed a complaint, testified in any hearing before this commission,\nor in any way assisted the commission in any matter under its investigation.” I.C. § 22-9-1-6(d),\n(g) (emphases added).\n\n\n        In addition, the majority’s view is also inconsistent Federal retaliation precedent.4 In the\nfederal context, all that is required for a complainant to succeed on a retaliation claim is that he or\nshe reasonably believed in good faith that the complained-of practice was discriminatory. See,\ne.g., Fine v. Ryan Int’l Airlines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779317\"><a href=\"/opinion/779317/lisa-s-fine-v-ryan-international-airlines-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 752 (7th Cir. 2002) (even where district court found\ncomplainant’s discrimination claim failed as a matter of law, she could still prevail on her\nretaliation claim); Wilkins v.

Thus even though FACES prevailed on\nBridgewater’s disability discrimination claim, it was nonetheless subject to the Bridgewater\nretaliation discrimination claim. See Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142881\"><a href=\"/opinion/142881/jackson-v-birmingham-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180-81\n(2005) (recognizing that the objective of preventing discriminatory practices “would be difficult,\nif not impossible, to achieve if persons who complain about . . . discrimination did not have\neffective protection against retaliation. . . . Without protection from retaliation, individuals who\nwitness discrimination would likely not report it . . . and the underlying discrimination would go\nunremedied” (internal quotation omitted)).\n\n\n\n\n        4\n          “In construing Indiana civil rights law our courts have often looked to federal law for guidance.”\nFilter Specialists, Inc. v.

I\ntherefore cannot join its opinion. Instead I would affirm in part the Commission’s decision.5\n\n\n\n\n        5\n          More specifically the Commission ordered FACES to take several remedial measures: (1) cease\nand desist from retaliating against persons because they filed a complaint with the ICRC; (2) post a link to\nthe Commission’s order on all websites on which FACES communicated information about the case; (3)\npay emotional distress damages to the daughter of Mrs. Bridgewater in the amount of $2500; and (4) offer\nreinstatement of the Bridgewater family to full membership in FACES. I would reverse the Commission\non this latter point as a violation of FACES’ constitutional right of intimate association. See generally\nRoberts v.
