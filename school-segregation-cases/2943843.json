In six issues, appellants argue the trial\n\ncourt erred by (1) striking a summary judgment affidavit filed by appellant Mark Johns; (2)\n\ngranting appellee’s traditional motion for summary judgment; (3) granting appellee’s no-\n\nevidence summary judgment motion; (4) overruling appellants’ objections to the summary\n\njudgment affidavit filed by C. Gregory Shamoun; (5) finding Mark Johns jointly and severally\n\nliable with Sunetics International, Inc.; and (6) finding that appellee did not prove it was entitled\n\fto the damages and attorneys’ fees awarded by the trial court. We affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgment in part, and reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                       BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       This appeal arises from a lawsuit brought by appellee, a Dallas law firm, for non-payment\n\nof various attorneys’ fees incurred during four legal matters. In April of 2007, appellee was\n\nhired to represent appellant Sunetics International, Inc. (“Sunetics, Inc.,” unless otherwise\n\nindicated), in a complex patent infringement case against Lexington Lasercomb I.P.A.G. and\n\nLexington International, L.L.C. (the “Sunetics litigation”). The agreement was signed by Mark\n\nJohns, Sunetics, Inc.’s president and secretary. Also in April of 2007, appellee was hired to\n\nrepresent appellant Woodhaven Partners, Ltd., in a real estate litigation and contract dispute\n\nagainst Marlin Land Development, L.L.C. (the “Marlin litigation”). The agreement was signed\n\nby Johns, the president of Woodhaven Partners. In August of 2007, appellants Woodhaven\n\nPartners, Ltd., WH Management, Inc., PMR Partners I, Ltd., and Johns hired appellee to\n\nrepresent them in litigation involving claims brought by Balch Springs Development II, L.P. (the\n\n“Balch Springs litigation”). The agreement was signed by Johns as the authorized agent for\n\nPMR Partners, Woodhaven, WH Management, and by Johns individually. The following April,\n\nappellee was hired by Johns to represent him in proceedings involving the conservatorship of\n\nJohns’s child (the “Johns custody litigation”).\n\n       On February 10, 2010, appellee brought suit against Woodhaven Partners, Ltd., Mark\n\nJohns, WH Management, Inc., PMR Partners I, Ltd., Sunetics International, L.P., Sunetics\n\nInternational, Inc., and JCMJ Ventures, L.L.C. (collectively, “appellants”) asserting causes of\n\naction for sworn account, breach of contract, and, alternatively, promissory estoppel and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  –2–\n\fquantum meruit, and fraud and fraud in the inducement, 1 based on appellants’ failure to pay\n\nincurred attorneys’ fees pursuant to the retainer agreements. Appellants answered. Appellants\n\nMark Johns, Woodhaven Partners, Ltd., and WH Management counterclaimed against appellee\n\nfor breach of contract, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, violations of the Texas\n\nDeceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), and breach of fiduciary duty, alleging that appellee\n\novercharged appellants for legal services:\n\n               [Appellants] would show that [appellants] and [appellee] entered into an\n       agreement whereby [appellee] agreed to provide legal services to [appellants] at a\n       reasonable rate. Notwithstanding this agreement, [appellee] overcharged\n       [appellants] for the legal services in issue, as the billings [appellants] received\n       from [appellee] were not proper and were not accurate causing damages to\n       [appellants] in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\nAppellants also alleged affirmative defenses of ratification, waiver, fraud, estoppel, laches,\n\nunclean hands, set-off, prior material breach, and the economic loss rule.\n\n       On October 4, 2010, appellee filed a traditional and no-evidence motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment. The summary judgment motion was supported, in part, by an affidavit from\n\nC. Gregory Shamoun, appellee’s president and managing partner. After various pleadings were\n\nsupplemented and amended by the parties, appellants filed their response to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment and objected to Shamoun’s affidavit. Affidavits from Mark Johns and Janet\n\nRandle, one of the attorneys of record for appellants, were included with appellants’ response to\n\nappellee’s summary judgment motion.\n\n       After another round of amended and supplemented pleadings, appellee filed, on April 19,\n\n2011, an amended traditional and no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment. On May\n\n11, 2011, along with their response to the amended motion for partial summary judgment,\n\nappellants filed a “Supplement to All Existing Answers,” which purported to be a verified denial\n\n\n       1\n           The claims for fraud and fraudulent inducement were subsequently nonsuited.\n\n\n\n                                                                  –3–\n\fof appellee’s claim for suit on a sworn account. Appellee objected to and moved to strike Mark\n\nJohns’s and Janet Randle’s affidavits.\n\n         On June 2, 2011, the trial court granted, in part, appellee’s amended motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment. The trial court sustained appellee’s objections to Johns’s affidavit and\n\noverruled its objections to Janet Randle’s affidavit.       The court then concluded that, given\n\ndeficiencies in appellee’s pleadings and proof, granting summary judgment against all appellants\n\nwould be reversible error. The trial court thus granted summary judgment as to all of appellee’s\n\nclaims against (1) Sunetics, Inc. for the Sunetics litigation, and all of its affirmative defenses and\n\ncounterclaims; (2) Woodhaven Partners for the Marlin litigation, and all of its affirmative\n\ndefenses and counterclaims; (3) Woodhaven Partners, WH Management, PMR Partners, and\n\nJohns for the Balch Springs litigation, and all of their affirmative defenses and counterclaims;\n\nand (4) Johns, individually, for the Johns custody litigation, and all of his affirmative defenses\n\nand counterclaims. The trial court did not grant summary judgment against Johns for the\n\nSunetics litigation or against WH Management for the Marlin litigation. The trial court also\n\ndeclined to award attorneys’ fees because it could not determine the appropriate amount of fees\n\nto award, given that appellee’s “attorney’s fees affidavit involves fees against certain Defendants\n\nagainst whom Judgment has not been achieved,” and that there was no “adequate segregation of\n\nfees.”\n\n         After supplementing its Fourth Amended Petition on June 30, 2011, appellee filed a\n\nsecond summary judgment motion. The motion sought attorneys’ fees and to hold Johns jointly\n\nand severally liable with Sunetics, Inc. for the Sunetics litigation, and WH Management jointly\n\nand severally with Woodhaven for the Marlin litigation. It was supported by an affidavit filed by\n\nShamoun, along with numerous attached documents. Appellee also provided a segregation of its\n\nattorneys’ fees in the Marlin and Sunetics litigation, supported by a second Shamoun affidavit.\n\n                                                 –4–\n\fIn their response, appellants objected to Shamoun’s first affidavit and moved to strike certain\n\nexhibits that accompanied the affidavit.\n\n          In the final judgment signed on September 29, 2011, the trial court granted appellee’s\n\nsecond motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The court struck one sentence of the\n\nShamoun affidavit, but overruled all of appellants’ other objections. The court’s final judgment\n\nfound, inter alia, (1) against Sunetics, Inc. and Mark Johns, jointly and severally, for $244,732.95\n\nin actual damages based on the Sunetics litigation, and $53,207.17 in attorneys’ fees; (2) against\n\nWoodhaven Partners and WH Management, jointly and severally, for $61,163.46 in actual\n\ndamages attributable to the Marlin litigation, and $18,853.30 in attorneys’ fees; (3) against\n\nWoodhaven Partners, WH Management, PMR Partners, and Mark Johns, jointly and severally,\n\nfor $11,102.38 in actual damages based on the Balch Springs litigation, and $11,546.41 in\n\nattorneys’ fees; and (4) against Mark Johns, individually, for $89,773.89 in actual damages\n\nattributable to the Johns custody litigation, and $23,456.65 in attorneys’ fees. Appellants filed a\n\nmotion for new trial that was overruled by operation of law, followed by the instant notice of\n\nappeal.\n\n                                            DISCUSSION\n\n                                     1. Affidavit of Mark Johns\n\n          In their first issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by striking the affidavit\n\ntestimony of Mark Johns because the testimony “was admissible under governing case law and\n\nthe applicable retainer agreements.”\n\n                                             Background\n\n          After appellee filed its traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment seeking\n\nsummary judgment as to its causes of action and appellants’ counterclaims, appellants’ response\n\nincluded an affidavit from Mark Johns disputing the reasonableness and necessity of the\n\n                                                 –5–\n\fattorneys’ fees that are the subject of this lawsuit. Appellee moved to strike paragraphs 4, 8, 12,\n\nand 16 of the Johns affidavit as it applied to the reasonableness and necessity of the attorneys’\n\nfees and services.\n\n       In each of the challenged paragraphs, Johns began by quoting the following language that\n\nis found in all of the relevant retainer agreements between appellants and appellee:\n\n       For purposes of this Engagement Letter, the Engagement means rendering of\n       reasonable and necessary legal services including, without limitation, conducting\n       a preliminary investigation; drafting documents, correspondence and pleadings;\n       motion practice; conducting and defending discovery; attending mediation and\n       trial; and drafting settlement documents. Reasonable and necessary legal services\n       shall be those which [the client] and [appellee] decide are reasonable and\n       necessary to perform the Engagement. . . [EMPHASIS ADDED].\n\nJohns stated that he did “not agree that the invoices sent in this case to me by [appellee] were all\n\nfor reasonable and necessary legal services that were reasonable and necessary to perform the\n\nEngagement.” He then noted that appellee “agreed that ‘Reasonable and necessary legal services\n\nshall be those which Client and [appellee] decide are reasonable and necessary,’” and added that\n\nhe did “not agree that the services provided by [appellee] were reasonable and necessary to\n\nperform the Engagement in this matter.” He reviewed individual invoices for various legal\n\nservices, after which he stated that the claims did “not reflect invoices for the legal services I\n\nbelieve were all reasonable and necessary,” and that he did not believe all of the services for\n\nwhich he was billed by appellee “were reasonable and necessary services as reflected above.”\n\n       Appellee’s motion to strike argued that Johns is not an attorney and that his assertions\n\nregarding the reasonableness and necessity of attorneys’ fees are not competent summary\n\njudgment evidence. The trial court sustained appellee’s objections in its order partially granting\n\nsummary judgment, finding:\n\n       Plaintiff’s Objections to the Johns Affidavit are SUSTAINED. Plaintiff is correct\n       that Johns is not a competent or qualified witness to offer an expert opinion as to\n       the reasonableness and necessity of attorney’s fees. In that respect, Plaintiff’s\n       objection is SUSTAINED, and paragraphs 4, 8, 12, and 16 are struck as expert\n                                                –6–\n\f       opinion evidence if being offered by Defendants to prove Plaintiff’s attorneys[’]\n       fees were not reasonable and necessary.\n\n                                        Standard of Review\n\n       Inclusion or exclusion of summary judgment evidence is a matter committed to the trial\n\ncourt’s discretion. See United Blood Servs. v. Longoria, 938 S.W.2d 29, 30 (Tex. 1997); All Am.\n\nTel., Inc. v. USLD Commc’ns, Inc., 291 S.W.3d 518, 528 (Tex. App.––Ft. Worth 2009, pet.\n\ndenied).      We review a trial court’s ruling sustaining or overruling objections to summary\n\njudgment evidence for an abuse of discretion. See All Am. Tel., 291 S.W.3d at 528; Bradford\n\nPartners II, L.P. v. Fahning, 231 S.W.3d 513, 521 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2007, no pet.); Cantu v.\n\nHorany, 195 S.W.3d 867, 871 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2006, no pet.). A trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion if its decision is arbitrary, unreasonable, and without reference to guiding principles.\n\nSee Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Malone, 972 S.W.2d 35, 43 (Tex. 1998). An appellate\n\ncourt must uphold the trial court’s evidentiary ruling if there is any legitimate basis for the\n\nruling. Id.\n\n                                             Analysis\n\n       Appellants argue that the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Anglo-Dutch Petroleum\n\nInt’l v. Greenberg Peden, P.C., 352 S.W.3d 445 (Tex. 2011), combined with the above-noted\n\nterms of the retainer agreements between appellants and appellee, gave Mark Johns the right to\n\ntestify as to his determination of the reasonableness and necessity of legal services. In particular,\n\nappellants cite this portion of the Anglo-Dutch Petroleum opinion:\n\n       Only reasonable clarity is required, not perfection; not every dispute over the\n       contract’s meaning must be resolved against the lawyer. But the object is that the\n       client be informed, and thus whether the lawyer has been reasonably clear must be\n       determined from the client’s perspective. Accordingly, we agree with the\n       Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers that “[a] tribunal should\n       construe a contract between client and lawyer as a reasonable person in the\n       circumstances of the client would have construed it.”\n\nId. at 451 (quoting RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS, § 18(2)).\n\n                                                –7–\n\f       There are several problems with this argument. To begin with, the issue in Anglo-Dutch\n\nPetroleum was whether the fee agreement letter that the client accepted was with the law firm of\n\nGreenberg Peden, P.C., or with the individual attorney, when the letter was written on firm\n\nletterhead and signed on behalf of the firm. Id. at 446. The dispute, in other words, was whether\n\nthe attorneys’ fee agreement was ambiguous. Id. The concept of viewing the agreement from\n\nthe client’s perspective, as applied, concerned whether the facts and circumstances viewed from\n\nthe client’s perspective indicated he was contracting with the firm and not the individual lawyer.\n\nId. at 449–453. In the present case, neither party below raised an issue of ambiguity that would\n\nrequire the fee agreements to be construed or interpreted by the court. Appellants are arguing,\n\ninstead, that Johns’s lay testimony is admissible in order to contest the reasonableness and\n\nnecessity of the attorneys’ fees in the underlying litigation. No reasonable interpretation of\n\nAnglo-Dutch Petroleum supports such an argument.\n\n       Texas law is clear that “[t]he issue of reasonableness and necessity of attorney’s fees\n\nrequires expert testimony.” Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Vega–Garcia, 223 S.W.3d 762, 770–71\n\n(Tex. App.––Dallas 2007, pet. denied); see also Phillips v. Phillips, 296 S.W.3d 656, 671 (Tex.\n\nApp.––El Paso 2009, pet. denied); Cantu v.

App.––Austin, May 6, 2011, no pet.) (mem. op.). An\n\nattorney testifies as to reasonableness; the testifying attorney must be designated as an expert\n\nbefore he or she testifies. See Lesikar v. Rappeport, 33 S.W.3d 282, 308 (Tex. App.––Texarkana\n\n2000, pet. denied); see also Nguyen Ngoc Giao v. Smith & Lamm, P.C., 714 S.W.2d 144, 148\n\n(Tex. App.––Houston [14th Dist.] 1986, no writ) (“An affidavit by an attorney representing a\n\n                                               –8–\n\fparty in a suit, concerning an award of attorney’s fees, whether in support of or in contradiction\n\nof an amount claimed to be reasonable, is admissible in a summary judgment proceeding and is\n\nconsidered expert testimony.”). As a result, lay witness testimony regarding the reasonableness\n\nand necessity of attorneys’ fees is not competent, admissible summary judgment evidence. See,\n\ne.g., Cantu, 90 S.W.3d at 826 (non-attorney testified as to appellate attorneys’ fees; such\n\ntestimony did not constitute expert testimony and award of appellate attorneys’ fees reversed on\n\nappeal); Woollett, 23 S.W.3d at 53 (a “layman’s unsupported assertion regarding reasonableness\n\nand necessity for attorney’s fees does not support the payment of attorney’s fees from the\n\nestate”); Ogu, 2011 WL 947008, at *3 (because counter-defendants, neither of whom were\n\nattorneys, did not designate themselves or qualify as experts on issues concerning attorneys’\n\nfees, trial court properly restricted their testimony concerning reasonableness and necessity of\n\nattorneys’ fees); Horvath, 2011 WL 1744969, at *9 (lay witness’s testimony as to what she paid\n\nher attorney was insufficient to support attorneys’ fee award); In the Interest of L.L., No. 04–08–\n\n00911–CV, 2010 WL 2403579, at *8 (Tex. App.––San Antonio June 16, 2010, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (party’s testimony regarding her attorney’s hourly rate and amount she had paid did not\n\nconstitute expert testimony and trial court erred in awarding attorney’s fees based on her\n\ntestimony).\n\n       In his affidavit, Mark Johns purports to testify regarding the reasonableness and necessity\n\nof attorneys’ fees and legal expenses in the underlying litigation. But Johns is not an attorney,\n\nand he does not qualify as an expert on issues concerning attorneys’ fees. He offered conclusory\n\nassertions without the support or analysis that must be performed by any witness testifying as to\n\nthe reasonableness and necessity of attorneys’ fees. Accordingly, because the testimony and\n\nopinions proffered by Johns in paragraphs 4, 8, 12, and 16 of his affidavit are inadmissible and\n\n\n\n\n                                               –9–\n\fnot competent summary judgment evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nsustaining appellee’s objections to Johns’s affidavit. We overrule appellants’ first issue.\n\n        2. Appellee’s Amended Traditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n       In their second issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting appellee’s\n\namended traditional motion for partial summary judgment because appellee did not prove it was\n\nentitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, “given the questions of fact raised in Mark\n\nJohns’s affidavit and Janet Randle’s affidavit as to [appellee’s] breach of contract on multiple\n\nretainer agreements.”    Appellee responds that the traditional summary judgment should be\n\naffirmed as to its claims against appellants because it proved there was no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding its cause of action for suit on a sworn account––one of the grounds on\n\nwhich it moved for traditional summary judgment.\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       We review the trial court’s summary judgment de novo. Provident Life & Accident Ins.\n\nCo. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2003). We apply the well-established standards for\n\nreviewing summary judgments. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c), (i); Timpte Indus., Inc. v. Gish, 286\n\nS.W.3d 306, 310–11 (Tex. 2009) (no-evidence summary judgment standard of review); Nixon v.\n\nMr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548–49 (Tex. 1985) (traditional summary judgment\n\nstandard of review). A traditional motion for summary judgment must show there is no genuine\n\nissue as to a specified material fact and, therefore, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). For a defendant to prevail on a traditional motion for\n\nsummary judgment, he must either disprove at least one element of the plaintiff's claim as a\n\nmatter of law, or conclusively establish all elements of an affirmative defense. Friendswood\n\nDev. Co. v. McDade & Co., 926 S.W.2d 280, 282 (Tex. 1996); Kalyanaram v. Univ. of Tex. Sys.,\n\n230 S.W.3d 921, 925 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2007, pet. denied). If the movant meets its burden,\n\n                                               –10–\n\fthen and only then must the non-movant respond and present evidence raising a fact issue. See\n\nRhone–Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 222–23 (Tex. 1999).\n\n       When, as in this case, multiple grounds for summary judgment are raised and the trial\n\ncourt does not specify the ground or grounds relied upon for its ruling, we will affirm the\n\nsummary judgment if any of the grounds advanced in the motion are meritorious. Carr v.\n\nBrasher, 776 S.W.2d 567, 569 (Tex. 1989); Red Roof Inns, Inc. v. Murat Holdings, L.L.C., 223\n\nS.W.3d 676, 684 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2007, pet. denied). The appealing party must show that\n\nnone of the proposed grounds is sufficient to support the judgment. See Star-Telegram, Inc. v.\n\nDoe, 915 S.W.2d 471, 473 (Tex. 1995); Jones v. Hyman, 107 S.W.3d 830, 832 (Tex. App.––\n\nDallas 2003, no pet.).   If an appellant does not challenge each possible ground on which\n\nsummary judgment could have been granted, we must uphold the summary judgment on the\n\nunchallenged ground. See, e.g., Carter v. PeopleAnswers, Inc., 312 S.W.3d 308, 311 (Tex. App.\n\n––Dallas 2010, no pet.); Jarvis v. Rocanville Corp., 298 S.W.3d 305, 313 (Tex. App.––Dallas\n\n2009, pet. denied).\n\n                               Appellee’s Sworn Account Claim\n\n       In support of count one of its fourth amended petition that alleged suit on a sworn\n\naccount against appellants, including Mark Johns, based on the unpaid legal fees and expenses,\n\nappellee filed a sworn account affidavit and verification from C. Gregory Shamoun, appellee’s\n\npresident and managing partner. Shamoun declared that, after “[a]ll just and lawful offsets,\n\npayments and credits” were applied, appellee was owed $244,732.95 on the account for the\n\nSunetics litigation; $61,163.46 for the Marlin litigation; $11,102.38 for the Balch Springs\n\nlitigation; and $89,773.89 for the Johns custody litigation. Shamoun further declared that he had\n\npersonal knowledge of all the facts set forth in the petition and verification, that the facts\n\ncontained “therein and herein” were true and correct, and that the claims asserted were for work\n\n                                              –11–\n\fperformed and were “just and true.” Attached to the affidavit are copies of lengthy billing\n\ninvoices from appellee that are itemized according to the date of each charge, the initials of the\n\nindividual (identified as “Staff”) who performed the service, a brief description of the work\n\nperformed, 2 the hours billed, the billing rate, and the charges.\n\n                                                        Appellants’ Response\n\n           Along with their response to appellee’s amended motion for partial summary judgment,\n\nappellants filed “Defendants’ Supplement to All Existing Answers,” which denied that appellants\n\nare “indebted for the amount alleged in Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition pursuant to Rules\n\n93(10) and 185 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.” Appellants quoted rules 93(10) and 185,\n\nafter which they denied “the sworn account made the basis of Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended\n\nPetition pursuant to Rules 93(10) and 185 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.” Appellants\n\nthen quoted rules 93(10) and 185 a second time. Appellants also supplied a “verification” from\n\nMark Johns which stated “that he has read the DEFENDANTS’ SUPPLEMENT TO ALL\n\nEXISTING ANSWERS; and that the allegations contained in Paragraphs II and III are within his\n\npersonal knowledge and true and correct.”\n\n                                                            Applicable Law\n\n           Rule 185 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure sets out the criteria for a suit on an\n\naccount and provides that an open account includes “any claim . . . for personal service\n\nrendered.” See TEX. R. CIV. P. 185. The cause of action must be supported by the affidavit of\n\nthe party, his agent or attorney “taken before some officer authorized to administer oaths, to the\n\neffect that such claim is, within the knowledge of affiant, just and true, that it is due, and that all\n\njust and lawful offsets, payments and credits have been allowed.” Id.; Panditi v. Apostle, 180\n\n\n           2\n             As with the other revised billing invoices in this record, the descriptions in these line items are heavily redacted or “blacked out”\nsave for a few words generally describing the activity being performed––with the specific nature of the work performed being redacted.\n\n\n\n                                                                     –12–\n\fS.W.3d 924, 926 (Tex.

(mem. op.).\n\n       The rule “is a rule of procedure regarding the evidence necessary to establish a prima\n\nfacie right of recovery.” Panditi, 180 S.W.3d at 926. An open account “on which a systematic\n\nrecord has been kept and is supported by an affidavit” is prima facie evidence of a claim. Id. A\n\nplaintiff claiming a suit on a sworn account is not required to formally introduce the account as\n\nevidence of the debt. Brown Found. Repair & Consulting, Inc. v. Friendly Chevrolet Co., 715\n\nS.W.2d 115, 116 (Tex. App.––Dallas 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.). This evidentiary presumption can\n\nbe destroyed, however, and the plaintiff forced to introduce proof of its claim, when a defendant\n\nfiles a sworn denial of the plaintiff’s account supported by an affidavit denying the account as\n\nrequired by rule 93(10). Powers v. Adams, 2 S.W.3d 496, 498 (Tex. App.––Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n1999, no pet.) (citing Roberts Express, Inc. v. Expert Transp., Inc., 842 S.W.2d 766, 770 (Tex.\n\nApp.––Dallas 1992, no writ)); see TEX. R. CIV. P. 93(10). In the absence of a sworn denial\n\nmeeting the requirements of the rule, the account is received as prima facie evidence against the\n\nparty. Vance v. Holloway, 689 S.W.2d 403, 404 (Tex. 1985).\n\n        “An opponent that does not properly file a written denial under oath will not be\n\npermitted to dispute the receipt of the services or the correctness of the charges” Andrews v. E.\n\nTex. Med. Ctr.-Athens, 885 S.W.2d 264, 267 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1994, no writ); see also\n\nHuddleston v. Case Power & Equip. Co., 748 S.W.2d 102, 103–04 (Tex.

Hence, he may not\n\n“dispute the receipt of the items or services, or the correctness of the stated charges.” See Rizk v.\n\nFin. Guardian Ins. Agency, Inc., 584 S.W.2d 860, 862 (Tex. 1979).\n\n                                               –13–\n\f       A sworn general denial does not constitute a denial of the account and is insufficient to\n\nremove the evidentiary presumption created by a properly worded and verified suit on an\n\naccount. See Panditi, 180 S.W.3d at 927; Andrews, 885 S.W.2d at 267; Martinez v. Rio Grande\n\nSteel, Ltd., No. 13–06–00097–CV, 2008 WL 668232, at *3 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi Mar. 13,\n\n2008, no pet.)

The defendant’s\n\nwritten denial must state more than a broad generalization that he “specifically denies” the sworn\n\naccount allegations; instead, the verified affidavit must address the facts on which the defendant\n\nintends to rebut the plaintiff’s affidavit. Andrews, 885 S.W.2d at 268; Martinez, 2008 WL\n\n668232, at *3.\n\n       In Andrews v. East Texas Medical Center, which is cited by appellee, the defendant\n\nswore under oath that the sworn account “was not true in whole or in part.” 885 S.W.2d at 265.\n\nThe court of appeals found that this answer, “although verified, is no more than a verified\n\ngeneral denial,” and thus insufficient. Id. at 268. The court noted that “the purpose of a verified\n\nspecific denial is to point out the manner in which the plaintiff’s allegations within the petition\n\nare not true. Otherwise neither the court nor the opposing party is apprised of the fact issue that\n\nnecessitates further litigation.” Id. at 267. Because the defendant’s answer “fail[ed] to address\n\nthe facts on which he intend[ed] to rebut the plaintiff’s affidavit,” the court concluded it did not\n\ncomply with rules 185 and 93(10), and, therefore, could not defeat summary judgment. Id. at\n\n268.\n\n                                             Analysis\n\n       Relying in part on Andrews, appellee argues that appellants’ “Supplement to All Existing\n\nAnswers,” though verified, was nothing more than a “sworn general denial” and that appellants\n\n\n\n\n                                               –14–\n\ffailed to meet the requirements of the rules of civil procedure. 3 Although they broadly challenge\n\nappellee’s traditional summary judgment motion, appellants do not challenge all possible\n\ngrounds on which summary judgment could have been granted. In particular, appellants do not\n\naddress appellee’s sworn account claim––no argument, analysis, citation to legal authority, or\n\nreference to the lengthy summary judgment record. 4 See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i) (requiring an\n\nappellant’s brief to contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions made, with\n\nappropriate citations to authorities and the record); Staton Holdings, Inc. v. Tatum L.L.C., 345\n\nS.W.3d 729, 733 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2011, pet. denied); Jarvis, 298 S.W.3d at 313–14; see also\n\nHaidar v. Nortex Found. Designs, Inc., 239 S.W.3d 924, 927 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2007, no pet.);\n\nScheler v. Smith, No. 05–08–01439–CV, 2010 WL 2978333, at *2 (Tex. App.––Dallas July 30,\n\n2010, no pet.) (mem. op.). An appellant cannot negate all possible grounds upon which a\n\nsummary judgment could have been granted merely by declaring that the appeal is intended to\n\nchallenge all possible grounds. See Jarvis, 298 S.W.3d at 313 n.8. The appellant “must also\n\nprovide appropriate arguments within that issue negating all possible grounds upon which\n\nsummary judgment could have been granted.” See id. Appellants have not done this. Because\n\nthey failed to challenge appellee’s suit on a sworn account claim on appeal, we could affirm the\n\ntrial court’s traditional summary judgment in appellee’s favor on that basis alone. See Staton,\n\n345 S.W.3d at 733; Jarvis, 298 S.W.3d at 314.\n\n           Nevertheless, we note that appellee’s sworn account affidavit attached to its petition\n\ncontains all of the necessary elements. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 185. The attached account invoices\n\n\n           3\n               In its amended traditional and no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment, appellee argued that because appellants failed to\nfile a sufficient verified denial in compliance with rules 185 and 93(10), and did not sufficiently deny the accounts on which the sworn account\nclaim was filed, there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the suit on a sworn account claim. This motion was actually filed several\nweeks before appellants’ “Supplement to All Existing Answers,” but there is no question that the sufficiency of appellants’ verified denial was\nbefore the trial court. Appellants’ counsel acknowledged during oral argument that appellee challenged the sufficiency of the verified denial in\nthe trial court.\n\n           4\n               The three-volume electronic clerk’s record filed in this case includes over 3,000 pages.\n\n\n\n                                                                        –15–\n\finclude information reflecting the date of each charge, initials of the individual who performed\n\nthe service, a brief description of the work performed, hours billed, the billing rate, and the\n\nspecific charges. Thus, appellee’s verified pleading was prima facie proof of appellants’ debts.\n\nAppellants’ broad, generalized denial, proffered as a “verified denial,” did not constitute a proper\n\ndenial of the sworn account. It was, at most, a verified general denial, which is insufficient to\n\nrebut the evidentiary effect of appellee’s sworn account pleadings and put appellee to its proof.\n\n       Additionally, “even when a defendant verifies its sworn denial to a suit on a sworn\n\naccount, a plaintiff may properly obtain summary judgment on its sworn account by filing ‘legal\n\nand competent summary judgment evidence establishing the validity of its claim as a matter of\n\nlaw.’” Andy’s Sunmart # 352, Inc. v. Reliant Energy Retail Services, L.L.C., No. 01–08–00890–\n\nCV, 2009 WL 3673093, at *3 (Tex. App.––Houston [1st Dist.], Nov. 5, 2009, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (quoting PennWell Corp. v. Ken Assocs. Inc., 123 S.W.3d 756, 765 (Tex. App.––Houston\n\n[14th Dist.) 2003, pet denied)); see also Prompt Prof’l Real Estate, Inc. v. RSC Equip. Rental,\n\nInc., 05–08–00398–CV, 2009 WL 1211810, at *2 (Tex. App.––Dallas May 5, 2009, no pet.)\n\n(mem. op.) (citing PennWell, 123 S.W.3d at 765).           Appellee did not move for summary\n\njudgment solely on the pleadings; it also moved for summary judgment on the grounds it had\n\nproven its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law based on the summary judgment evidence.\n\nAs part of its amended partial summary judgment motion, appellee included an affidavit from\n\nShamoun stating that the firm was hired to represent various appellants on several legal matters,\n\n“including a custody dispute, real estate and contract disputes, and a complex patent\n\ninfringement case,” and that Mark Johns was appellee’s “primary contact and the corporate\n\nrepresentative of each of the entity Defendants, with whom [appellee] dealt relative to the\n\nunderlying litigation matters.” Shamoun declared that, exclusive of interest, a total principal\n\nbalance of $244,732.95 was due and payable for legal services furnished “to and for the Sunetics\n\n                                               –16–\n\fDefendants”; $61,163.46 for legal services furnished “to and for the Marlin Defendants”;\n\n$11,102.38 for legal services furnished “to and for the Balch Springs Defendants”; and\n\n$89,773.89 for legal services furnished “to and for Johns.” The affidavit further stated that\n\nappellee provided the “Sunetics Defendants,” “Marlin Defendants, “Balch Springs Defendants”\n\nand Johns with “regular statements of account” that set forth the “time and expenses incurred in\n\nrendering legal services” and that, on several occasions, it made demand on appellants for\n\npayment on the outstanding balances due on these accounts, but appellants “failed and refused to\n\npay.” “All lawful offsets, payments and credits have been applied” to the accounts, and they\n\nremain unpaid. Appended to the affidavit were, according to the affidavit, “original or exact\n\nduplicates of the original” billing invoices. 5\n\n             In their response, apart from proclaiming that their verified denial was sufficient to defeat\n\nappellee’s sworn account claim, appellants cited no competent summary judgment evidence in\n\nresponse to appellee’s summary judgment evidence in support of its sworn account claim. See\n\nBich Ngoc Nguyen v. AllState Ins. Co., 404 S.W.3d 770, 776 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2013, pet.\n\ndenied) (nonmovant must refer specifically to evidence it claims raises a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact). Even if we assume appellants’ purported sworn denial of the accounts was\n\nsufficient to force appellee to put on proof of its claims, it did not raise an issue of fact. See\n\nUnited Bus. Machs. v. Entm’t Mktg., Inc., 792 S.W.2d 262, 264 (Tex. App.––Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n1990, no writ) (buyer’s sworn denial, while destroying evidentiary effect of account and forcing\n\nseller to put on proof, did not constitute any evidence in opposition to seller’s subsequent\n\nsummary judgment motion because pleadings are not summary judgment evidence). Therefore,\n\nappellants failed to raise an issue of fact to defeat summary judgment, and the trial court properly\n\n\n\n             5\n                 The invoices are redacted or “blacked out,” as noted earlier, to omit information regarding the specific nature of the work that was\nperformed.\n\n\n                                                                        –17–\n\fgranted summary judgment, on appellee’s sworn account claim. We overrule appellants’ second\n\nissue.\n\n         3. Appellee’s Amended No-Evidence Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n         In their third issue, appellants contend the trial court erred by granting appellee’s no-\n\nevidence motion for summary judgment as to appellants’ counterclaims for breach of contract,\n\nnegligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, DTPA, and breach of fiduciary duty, “given the\n\nevidence presented by affidavit testimony of Mark Johns and Janet Randle.”\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n         A no-evidence motion for summary judgment under rule 166a(i) must challenge specific\n\nelements of the opponent’s claim or defense on which the opponent will have the burden of proof\n\nat trial. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i). The opponent must then present summary judgment evidence\n\nraising a genuine issue of material fact to support the challenged elements. Id. A genuine issue\n\nof material fact exists if the non-movant produces more than a scintilla of evidence supporting\n\nthe existence of the challenged element. Fort Worth Osteopathic Hosp., Inc. v. Reese, 148\n\nS.W.3d 94, 99 (Tex. 2004).\n\n                 Challenge to Damages Element for Each of the Counterclaims\n\n         In its amended traditional and no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment,\n\nappellee argued, in part, that appellants’ counterclaims failed as a matter of law because there\n\nwas no evidence of recoverable damages for any of the counterclaims apart from attorneys’ fees,\n\nwhich are not recoverable as damages in and of themselves. In particular, appellee cited excerpts\n\nfrom Mark Johns’s deposition to argue that the only evidence of actual damages showed\n\nappellants’ damages were based on attorneys’ fees, court costs, time, and effort spent defending\n\nagainst appellee’s claims:\n\n\n\n\n                                               –18–\n\f       Q. [APPELLEE’S TRIAL COUNSEL:] But the damages that you are––Sunetics\n       is claiming that my firm caused, is the attorney’s fees that you’re having Sunetics\n       is having to pay, correct?\n\n       A. [JOHNS:] Attorney’s fees, time, and effort.\n\n       ****\n\n       Q. [APPELLEE’S TRIAL COUNSEL:] The damages you’ve incurred include\n       attorney’s fees and court costs; is that fair?\n\n       A. [JOHNS:] Yes, sir.\n\n       Q. They also include time spent; is that right?\n\n       A. Yes, sir.\n\nIn their response to the amended motion for partial summary judgment, appellants asserted:\n\n       Defendants argue herein that the motions should be denied on the grounds that\n       Plaintiff has not met its burden of establishing, as a matter of law, that they are\n       entitled to prevail on summary judgment, as questions of material fact as to: (1)\n       which parties were signatories to the contracts in question; and (2) which, if any,\n       party breached the agreement first; and (3) the amount of monies, if any, owed.\n\nThey also argued:\n\n       There are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the Plaintiff breached the\n       agreement by failing to submit invoices to each Defendant timely, whether those\n       invoices reflected the reasonable services decided on by both Defendant and\n       Plaintiff as required by each agreement, whether the Defendants being sued on\n       said agreement were in fact parties to the agreement, and whether the Plaintiff\n       who signed the agreement is in fact the same plaintiff in this action, or has the\n       same rights as the Plaintiff who signed the agreements in question.\n\nAppellants, however, did not address appellee’s contentions regarding damages or attempt to\n\nsubstantiate the “actual damages” elements of their counterclaims, and on appeal they fail to\n\npoint to any damages they suffered as a result of appellee’s conduct––apart from the incurring of\n\nattorneys’ fees and legal expenses.\n\n                         Attorneys’ Fees Not Recoverable as Damages\n\n       Texas law distinguishes between the recovery of attorneys’ fees as actual damages and\n\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees incident to the recovery of other actual damages. Worldwide Asset\n\n\n                                              –19–\n\fPurchasing, L.L.C. v. Rent–a–Center East, Inc., 290 S.W.3d 554, 570 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2009,\n\nno pet.).

Young Corp., 113 S.W.3d 889, 898 (Tex.\n\nApp.––Dallas 2003, no pet.). As a general rule, attorneys’ fees are not recoverable as damages\n\nin and of themselves. See, e.g., Tana Oil & Gas Corp. v. McCall, 104 S.W.3d 80, 82 (Tex.\n\n2003); Imagine Automotive Group, Inc. v. Boardwalk Motor Cars, L.L.C., 356 S.W.3d 716, 718\n\n(Tex. App.––Dallas 2011, no pet.); Haden v. David J.

See Tana, 104 S.W.3d at 82 (damages described in terms of “value\n\nof time spent” and “costs incurred” in defending lawsuit were non-recoverable, even if party\n\nseeking such damages could have proven all other elements of claim for tortious interference);\n\nEberts v.

We know of no authority supporting recovery of actual damages for such a\n\n                                                –20–\n\floss . . . .”); see also Haden v. David J.

This is true even if all other elements of the party’s claim are proven. See Tana, 104\n\nS.W.3d at 82; Consumer Portfolio Servs, Inc. v. Obregon, No. 13–09–00548–CV, 2010 WL\n\n4361765, at *9 (Tex.

Beginning with breach of contract, the elements of a breach of\n\ncontract claim are (1) the existence of a valid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance\n\nby the plaintiff; (3) breach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages to the plaintiff\n\nresulting from that breach. Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 521–22 (quoting Wright v. Christian & Smith,\n\n950 S.W.2d 411, 412 (Tex. App.––Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, no writ)); see also Domingo v.\n\nMitchell, 257 S.W.3d 34, 39 (Tex. App.––Amarillo 2008, pet. denied). A party may recover\n\nattorneys’ fees in a breach of contract claim without an agreement providing for them if the party\n\nclaiming the fees (1) prevails on its breach of contract claim and (2) recovers damages. See TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.002; Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 522.\n\n                          Negligence and Negligent Misrepresentation\n\n       A negligence claim against an attorney requires proof that (1) the attorney owed the\n\nplaintiff a duty; (2) the attorney’s negligent act or omission breached that duty; (2) the breach\n\nproximately caused the plaintiff’s injury, and (4) the plaintiff suffered damages. See Akin,\n\nGump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. L.L.P. v. Nat’l Dev. & Research Corp., 299 S.W.3d 106, 112\n\n(Tex. 2009).    The elements of negligent misrepresentation are:        (1) a defendant provided\n\ninformation in the course of his business, or in a transaction in which he had a pecuniary interest;\n\n                                               –21–\n\f(2) the information supplied was false; (3) the defendant did not exercise reasonable care or\n\ncompetence in obtaining or communicating the information; (4) the plaintiff justifiably relied on\n\nthe information; and (5) the plaintiff suffered damages proximately caused by the reliance.\n\nLarsen v. Carlene Langford & Assocs., 41 S.W.3d 245, 249–50 (Tex. App.––Waco 2001, pet.\n\ndenied); see McCamish, Martin, Brown & Loeffler v. F.E. Appling Interests, 991 S.W.2d 787,\n\n791 (Tex. 1999).\n\n                         Fraud, DTPA, and Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n\n       To establish a claim for fraud, the proof must establish a material misrepresentation,\n\nwhich was false, and which was either known to be false when made or was asserted without\n\nknowledge of the truth, which was intended to be acted upon, which was relied upon, and which\n\ncaused injury. DeSantis v. Wackenhut Corp., 793 S.W.2d 670, 688 (Tex. 1990). Attorneys’ fees\n\nare not recoverable as actual damages in fraud cases. Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 519.\n\n       To establish a claim for violations of the DTPA, a plaintiff must show he sustained\n\ndamages. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 17.50(a) (requiring that defendant’s act constitute\n\na producing cause of economic or mental anguish damages); Latham v. Castillo, 972 S.W.2d 66,\n\n69 (Tex. 1998) (stating elements of claim for unconscionable conduct recovery under DTPA,\n\nincluding damages pursuant to section 17.50(a)); see also Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 519. “In a\n\nDTPA claim, ‘[w]ithout an actual-damages recovery, a party is not entitled to an attorney’s fee\n\nrecovery.’” Haden, 332 S.W.3d at 519 (quoting Gulf States Util. v. Low, 79 S.W.3d 561, 567\n\n(Tex. 2002)).\n\n       To    recover   for   breach   of   a   fiduciary   duty,   the   evidence   must   show\n\nthe existence of a fiduciary duty, breach of the duty, causation, and damages. Id. (quoting\n\nAbetter Trucking Co. v. Arizpe, 113 S.W.3d 503, 508 (Tex. App.––Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no\n\npet.)). Clients who sue their attorney for breach of fiduciary duty “need not prove actual\n\n                                               –22–\n\fdamages in order to obtain forfeiture of an attorney’s fees for the attorney’s breach of fiduciary\n\nduty to the client.” Burrow v. Arce, 997 S.W.2d 229, 240 (Tex. 1999); see also Haden, 332\n\nS.W.3d at 520. This exception arises when the complaining party seeks forfeiture of fees paid to\n\ncounsel who breaches a fiduciary duty. Haden, 222 S.W.3d at 596 n.13. In that instance, the\n\ncomplaining party need not produce evidence of actual damages. See id. But appellants did not\n\nassert this type of damages in their pleadings or in their response to the amended motion for\n\npartial summary judgment. See Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 240; Bailey v. Gallagher, 348 S.W.3d\n\n322, 325 n.2 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2011, pet. denied); Si Kyu Kim v. Harstan, Ltd., 286 S.W.3d\n\n629, 635 n.1 (Tex. App.––El Paso 2009, pet. denied); Longaker v. Evans, 32 S.W.3d 725, 733\n\nn.2 (Tex. App.––San Antonio 2000, pet. withdrawn). Consequently, the exception does not\n\napply in this case.\n\n                                            Analysis\n\n       Appellee contends that the record in this case does not contain any competent summary\n\njudgment evidence that appellants incurred or would incur recoverable damages for any of their\n\ncounterclaims. In their brief, appellants argue that the Mark Johns and Janet Randle affidavits––\n\ncited in their third issue––raise an issue of fact as to whether appellee breached the retainer\n\nagreements, and/or its duty to keep appellants informed, thereby precluding, at a minimum,\n\nsummary judgment on appellants’ breach of contract counterclaim.          But appellants do not\n\nsupport their assertion with any substantive argument, analysis, citation to legal authority, or\n\nreference to the summary judgment record. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i); In re Estate of Miller,\n\n243 S.W.3d 831, 840 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2008, no pet.) (issue waived because appellant did not\n\nanalyze legal authority and made “no suggested application of it to the facts”); In re B.A.B., 124\n\nS.W.3d 417, 420 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2004, no pet.) (“failure to adequately brief an issue, either\n\nby failing to specifically argue and analyze one’s position or provide authorities and record\n\n                                              –23–\n\fcitations, waives any error on appeal”); see also Haidar, 239 S.W.3d at 927; Scheler, 2010 WL\n\n2978333, at *2. Issues raised on appeal, but not briefed, are waived. See, e.g., Haidar, 239\n\nS.W.3d at 927.\n\n           Furthermore, assuming appellants’ argument was not waived, the summary judgment\n\nevidence in this case shows that the only damages stated by appellants consist of legal fees and\n\nexpenses they incurred in defending against this lawsuit brought by appellee and in prosecuting\n\ntheir counterclaims.              Well-settled law recognizes that attorneys’ fees and expenses are not\n\nrecoverable as damages in and of themselves. See, e.g., Tana, 104 S.W.3d at 82; Haden, 332\n\nS.W.3d at 521. Additionally, appellants did not seek the forfeiture of paid attorneys’ fees as\n\ndamages or establish any other type of compensable damages for their breach of fiduciary duty\n\ncounterclaim. See Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 240. For these reasons, we conclude the trial court\n\nproperly granted no-evidence summary judgment in appellee’s favor based on the absence of a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding the damages element of appellants’ counterclaims. See\n\nW. Invs. v. Urena, 162 S.W.3d 547, 550 (Tex. 2005) (we will affirm summary judgment if any of\n\nthe grounds alleged in the summary judgment motion are meritorious). We overrule appellants’\n\nthird issue. 6\n\n                                            4. Affidavit of C. Gregory Shamoun\n\n           In their fourth issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by overruling appellants’\n\nobjection to the affidavit of C. Gregory Shamoun and accompanying exhibits, and subsequently\n\nallowing into evidence “hearsay and inadmissible redacted entries of attorney billings from\n\nwhich no evidence of work was able to be determined for purposes of reasonableness of services\n\nto support [appellee’s] traditional summary judgment.” Appellants specifically challenge the\n\n           6\n              The trial court also granted summary judgment for appellee on appellants’ affirmative defenses of ratification, waiver, fraud,\nestoppel, laches, unclean hands, set off, prior material breach, and the economic loss rule. Appellants do not raise any of these issues on appeal.\nAccordingly, we do not address them. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n\n\n                                                                     –24–\n\ffollowing documents attached to Shamoun’s affidavit: (1) redacted invoices for legal services\n\nand (2) information obtained over the internet from the Texas Secretary of State and Nevada\n\nSecretary of State websites.\n\n                                                                Background\n\n           The trial court initially granted appellee’s amended motion for partial summary judgment\n\non all of appellee’s causes of action, and ruled against appellants on their affirmative defenses\n\nand counterclaims. The trial court, however, did not grant summary judgment in its entirety\n\nagainst all appellants, nor did it award attorneys’ fees. Appellee then filed a second motion for\n\npartial summary judgment arguing that Johns should be held individually liable under Texas law\n\nfor the unpaid legal services and costs associated with the Sunetics litigation, and that WH\n\nManagement should be jointly and severally liable as a general partner of Woodhaven, against\n\nwhom summary judgment had already been granted, for the unpaid legal services and costs\n\nassociated with the Marlin litigation. The second summary judgment motion also segregated\n\nappellee’s section 38.001 attorneys’ fees for the current lawsuit.\n\n           Appellee’s second partial summary judgment motion included two additional affidavits\n\nfrom Shamoun––attached to the motion as exhibits “A” and “4.” Only one of these affidavits,\n\nexhibit A, is challenged on appeal. 7 In the exhibit A affidavit, after stating he had “personal\n\nknowledge of all facts set forth herein,” Shamoun attested that he was the firm’s president and\n\nmanaging partner and had care, custody, and control of the documents attached to the affidavit,\n\nwhich he alleged were “the original or exact duplicates of the original.” 8 Those documents\n\n\n           7\n              When they objected to Shamoun’s affidavit in the trial court, appellants did not specify whether they were objecting to the exhibit A\naffidavit, the exhibit 4 affidavit, or both. On appeal, however, appellants limit the discussion in their brief to the exhibit A affidavit and\naccompanying documents. They do not challenge the other Shamoun affidavit, exhibit 4, which is discussed in part six of this opinion.\nConsequently, to the extent appellants are contending they objected in the trial court to the exhibit 4 affidavit, and that the trial court erred by\noverruling those objections, that issue has been waived for inadequate briefing. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n           8\n               Paragraph 2 of the affidavit reads as follows:\n\n\n\n                                                                      –25–\n\fincluded lengthy attorneys’ fee invoices and billing statements for the Sunetics and Marlin\n\nlitigation, attached to the affidavit as exhibits A-2, A-3, A-5, and A-6. Exhibit A-2 contained\n\ntwo revised invoices totaling $244,732.95 in unpaid bills for legal services provided to Sunetics,\n\nInc.––charges that Shamoun stated were attributable to the Sunetics litigation. Exhibit A-5\n\ncontained a revised invoice for $61,163.46 in unpaid charges for legal services provided to\n\nWoodhaven Partners and WH Management––charges that Shamoun attested were attributable to\n\nthe Marlin litigation. Each invoice was itemized according to the date of the charge, a brief\n\ndescription of the charge, the billable hours, the billing rate, and the specific charge. As with the\n\ninvoices that accompanied appellee’s verified petition, the descriptions in these documents of the\n\nwork performed were redacted or “blacked out” save for a few words describing the activity\n\nbeing performed, e.g. “draft and revise,” “review,” “teleconference,” “research,” “copying,”\n\n“filing,” etc., with the specific nature of the work performed being redacted. Exhibits A-3 and\n\nA-6 contained, among other documents, unrevised invoices for the Sunetics and Marlin\n\nlitigation; the descriptions in these documents of the work performed were entirely redacted.\n\n       Also attached to Shamoun’s exhibit A affidavit, as exhibits A-10, A-11, and A-12, were\n\ndocuments obtained over the internet from the websites for the Texas Secretary of State and the\n\nNevada Secretary of State. These documents were offered in support of appellee’s argument that\n\nJohns should be held individually liable under section 171.255 of the Texas Tax Code, which\n\nimposes a corporation’s liability on the corporation’s directors and officers during a period of\n\nforfeiture of corporate privileges and for failing to file franchise reports. See TEX. TAX CODE\n\n\n       I have been and am the president of the managing partner of Shamoun & Norman, LLP f/k/a Shamoun Klatsky Norman\n       (“S&N”), Plaintiff in the above-styled suit. I have care, custody, and control of records concerning the accounts of each of\n       the various Defendants in the above-styled and numbered cause. Attached hereto are 221 pages of records from S&N.\n       These said 221 pages of records are kept by S&N in the regular course of business, and it was the regular course of\n       business of S&N for an employee or representative of S&N, with knowledge of the act, event, condition, opinion, or\n       diagnosis, recorded to make the record or to transmit information thereof to be included in such record; and the record was\n       made at or near the time or reasonably soon thereafter. The records attached hereto are the original or exact duplicates of\n       the original.\n\n\n\n                                                                 –26–\n\fANN. § 171.255. Appellee argued that, based on this statute, Johns should be held individually\n\nliable for the unpaid legal fees and costs associated with the Sunetics litigation. The last two\n\nparagraphs of the affidavit, which discuss the Secretary of State documents, assert that appellee\n\nused public information obtained only and directly from the Texas Secretary of State and Nevada\n\nSecretary of State websites and online record repositories, and that this information was retrieved\n\nby “competent computer operators who followed careful procedures by printing” the images of\n\nthe websites directly to a printer.\n\n                                      Appellants’ Objections\n\n        In their “Objection to Affidavit of C. Gregory Shamoun and Accompanying Exhibits,”\n\npart of appellants’ response to appellee’s second motion for partial summary judgment, they\n\nbrought the following objections:\n\n                Defendants object to the Affidavit of C. Gregory Shamoun because Mr.\n        Shamoun does not establish a foundation for testifying as to the work performed.\n        He merely states that he is the managing partner of the firm in question but has no\n        testimony regarding his work with the client during the period in question. In\n        addition, Plaintiff objects to the legal conclusions regarding “jointly and\n        severally” as there is no such language in the contract, and Mr. Shamoun is\n        testifying as to legal conclusions that are contradicted by the express language of\n        the contract. As such, his affidavit lacks the proper foundation to testify as to the\n        reasonableness and necessity of the work provided, and as to any intent on the\n        part of any defendant to be jointly and severally liable for any work. The\n        contracts at issue speak for themselves, and Plaintiff objects to the “parole”\n        evidence Mr. Shamoun attempts to proffer in his affidavit.\n\nAppellants also objected to exhibits A-2, A-3, A-5, and A-6 and moved to strike them because\n\nthey were “redacted,” thus making the exhibits “void of any content and insufficient to establish\n\nthe reasonableness of any work or time worked.”\n\n        On appeal, appellants contend Shamoun’s affidavit “did not lay a proper foundation for\n\nMr. Shamoun to authenticate the exhibits that were attached.” They argue Shamoun was “an\n\ninterested witness” and that his testimony “was of such a nature that it could not be readily\n\ncontradicted if untrue, given the redacted state of the billing.”        Appellants further argue\n                                               –27–\n\fShamoun’s affidavit was “self-serving” because “[h]is testimony is based upon redacted billing\n\nentries. . . that were impossible for the Court to read much less evaluate.” Appellants also take\n\nissue with Shamoun’s assertion that the billing records attached to the affidavit are “the original\n\nor exact duplicates of the original.” Appellants claim the documents “do not reflect the legal\n\nservices, as they are completely redacted.” 9\n\n           When appellants objected to Shamoun’s affidavit in the trial court, they did not argue he\n\nwas an interested witness. An objection asserting that an affiant is an interested witness is an\n\nobjection to a defect in the form of an affidavit, and must be preserved in the trial court. See\n\nStrother v. City of Rockwall, 358 S.W.3d 462, 468–69 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2012, no pet.); Four\n\nD Constr., Inc. v. Util. & Envtl. Servs., Inc., No. 05–12–00068–CV, 2013 WL 2563785, at *2\n\n(Tex. App.––Dallas June 7, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.); see also Ahumada v. Dow Chem. Co., 992\n\nS.W.2d 555, 562 (Tex. App.––Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet. denied). A party must object in\n\nwriting and obtain an express or implied ruling from the trial court to preserve a complaint about\n\nthe form of summary judgment evidence. Grand Prairie I.S.D. v. Vaughan, 792 S.W.2d 944,\n\n945 (Tex. 1990); Strother, 358 S.W.3d at 468–69. Because appellants did not do this, their\n\nargument was not preserved for appellate review. See, e.g., Strother, 358 S.W.3d at 468–69;\n\nFour D Constr., 2013 WL 2563785, at *2.\n\n           As for appellants’ other arguments, they objected to Shamoun’s affidavit, both in the trial\n\ncourt and on appeal, on the grounds it did not establish a foundation for testifying as to the work\n\nperformed by appellee. An objection that an affidavit failed to establish the basis for an affiant’s\n\n\n           9\n              The trial court sustained one of appellants’ trial objections, striking “sentence 3 of paragraph 3 as to the ‘jointly and severally’\nlanguage therein.” The sentence read as follows: “S&N rendered legal services to the Sunetics Defendants jointly and severally pursuant to\nS&N’s agreement with the Sunetics Defendants and in full performance of such agreement.” The ruling is not challenged on appeal.\n           Additionally, we note that appellants’ “Objection to Affidavit of C. Gregory Shamoun and Accompanying Exhibits” also objected to\nexhibits A-10, A-11, and A-12, the Secretary of State documents. Because of our conclusion in part five of this opinion reversing and remanding\nthe portion of the trial court’s judgment holding Mark Johns jointly and severally liable for the $244,732.95 in underlying attorneys’ fees and\nexpenses attributable to the Sunetics litigation, the only issue raised on appeal for which the Secretary of State documents have any relevance, we\nwill not address appellants’ objections to those exhibits. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1 (opinion must address issues “necessary to final disposition of\nthe appeal”).\n\n\n                                                                     –28–\n\fpersonal knowledge of the facts asserted in the affidavit goes to the substance, not the form, of\n\nthe affidavit, and need not have been raised in the trial court. See Stone v. Midland Multifamily\n\nEquity REIT, 334 S.W.3d 371, 375 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2011, no pet.); City of Wilmer v. Laidlaw\n\nWaste Sys. (Dallas), Inc., 890 S.W.2d 459, 467 (Tex. App.––Dallas 1994), aff’d, 904 S.W.2d\n\n656 (Tex. 1995).\n\n       In the exhibit A affidavit, Shamoun stated that he had personal knowledge of all facts set\n\nforth in the affidavit, and that he had care, custody, and control of the records attached to the\n\naffidavit. He did not detail his work for the clients during the periods in question. But he stated\n\nthat he was appellee’s managing partner, that appellee was hired by Sunetics, Inc. and Johns to\n\nrepresent them during the Sunetics litigation, and by Woodhaven Partners and WH Management\n\nto represent them during the Marlin litigation, that the legal services were provided pursuant to\n\nthe specific fee agreements, and that appellee provided the legal services reflected in the attached\n\ninvoices. The revised invoices, furthermore, although heavily redacted, contained line-by-line\n\nitemizations of the various charges together with brief descriptions of each charge. Contrary to\n\nthe suggestion in appellants’ brief that these invoices were “completely redacted,” significant\n\ninformation was provided regarding the activities conducted by appellee during the underlying\n\nlitigation. We conclude that the affidavit demonstrated a sufficient basis for Shamoun’s personal\n\nknowledge regarding the facts alleged. See Hydroscience Technologies, Inc. v. Hydroscience,\n\nInc., 401 S.W.3d 783, 791–92 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2013, pet. denied) (for summary judgment\n\naffidavit to have probative value, affiant must swear facts in the affidavit reflect his personal\n\nknowledge; references to true and correct copies of documents in support of an affidavit can\n\nestablish personal knowledge); Valenzuela v. State & Cnty. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 317 S.W.3d 550,\n\n552 (Tex. App.––Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (affiant’s position or job responsibilities\n\ncan qualify him to have personal knowledge of facts and establish how he learned of the facts).\n\n                                               –29–\n\fHence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling appellants’ objections. We\n\noverrule appellants’ fourth issue.\n\n                           5. Mark Johns’s Joint and Several Liability\n\n        In their fifth issue, appellants contend the trial court erred by finding Mark Johns jointly\n\nliable with Sunetics, Inc. for the Sunetics litigation attorneys’ fees and expenses because the\n\nevidence was insufficient to establish Sunetics, Inc.’s violation of any law.\n\n        At issue is the part of the trial court’s final judgment finding Johns, as an individual,\n\njointly and severally liable with Sunetics, Inc. for the $244,732.95 in actual damages attributable\n\nto the Sunetics litigation, together with reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees and costs and\n\npre and post-judgment interest. In its second motion for partial summary judgment, appellee\n\nargued that Johns, as the president and secretary of Sunetics, was jointly and severally liable for\n\nits debts because of Sunetics, Inc.’s forfeiture of corporate privileges (i.e., “Johns is jointly and\n\nseverally liable for the debts of Sunetics, Inc. as a result of Sunetics, Inc.’s forfeiture of corporate\n\nprivileges under Texas Tax Code § 171.255.”).\n\n        Section 171.255 provides:\n\n        (a) If the corporate privileges of a corporation are forfeited for the failure to file a\n        report or pay a tax or penalty, each director or officer of the corporation is liable\n        for each debt of the corporation that is created or incurred in this state after the\n        date on which the report, tax, or penalty is due and before the corporate privileges\n        are revived. The liability includes liability for any tax or penalty imposed by this\n        chapter on the corporation that becomes due and payable after the date of the\n        forfeiture.\n\n        (b) The liability of a director or officer is in the same manner and to the same\n        extent as if the director or officer were a partner and the corporation were a\n        partnership.\n\n        (c) A director or officer is not liable for a debt of the corporation if the director or\n        officer shows that the debt was created or incurred: (1) over the director’s\n        objection; or (2) without the director’s knowledge and that the exercise of\n        reasonable diligence to become acquainted with the affairs of the corporation\n        would not have revealed the intention to create the debt.\n\n                                                 –30–\n\f        (d) If a corporation’s charter or certificate of authority and its corporate\n       privileges are forfeited and revived under this chapter, the liability under this\n       section of a director or officer of the corporation is not affected by the revival of\n       the charter or certificate and the corporate privileges.\n\nTEX. TAX CODE ANN. § 171.255; Trammell v. Galaxy Ranch School, L.P., 246 S.W.3d 815, 821–\n\n22 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2008, no pet.).\n\n       The problem with appellee’s reliance on this statute is that, as appellee acknowledged in\n\nits second motion for partial summary judgment, Sunetics, Inc. filed its articles of incorporation\n\nin Nevada on March 3, 2005. As part of its summary judgment motion, appellee cited various\n\nprovisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes to argue that Nevada law, like Texas, requires\n\ncorporations to file annual forms that include the names and addresses of officers and directors.\n\nSee NEV. REV. STAT. § 78.150. This “annual list” must be filed “on or before the last day of the\n\nmonth in which the anniversary date of incorporation occurs each year.” Id. § 78.150(2). Failure\n\nto file the annual forms results in revocation of the corporate charter and a forfeiture of its right\n\nto transact business. See id. § 78.175(2). Moreover a document from the Nevada Secretary of\n\nState that is part of appellee’s summary judgment proof––a “Certificate of Existence With Status\n\nof Revocation” for Sunetics, Inc.––shows that Sunetics failed to timely file its annual list or pay\n\nthe required fee, and that it was in “revocation” under Nevada law as of April 1, 2010, for failing\n\nto file the annual list of officers and directors and designated agent for the period March 2009 to\n\nMarch 2010, as required by the Nevada Revised Statutes. See id. §§ 78.150, 78.175.\n\n       In Tri-State Building Specialties, Inc. v. NCI Building Systems, L.P., 184 S.W.3d 242\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no pet.), the court concluded that section 171.255 of the\n\nTexas Tax Code did not apply to a corporation whose privileges were suspended in another state\n\nfor nonpayment of taxes in that jurisdiction. Id. at 251–52. The court noted that “[i]t is well-\n\nsettled that section 171.255 must be strictly construed to protect those individuals against whom\n\n\n\n                                               –31–\n\fliability is sought because it is penal in nature and cannot be extended beyond the clear meaning\n\nof its language.” Id. at 251. The court then stated:\n\n              Chapter 171 of the Tax Code, of which section 171.255 is part, governs\n       franchise taxation in Texas. Franchise taxes governed by that chapter are taxes on\n       the privilege of transacting business within Texas. As Texas courts have\n       recognized, section 171.255 is a revenue measure, the purpose of which is to\n       enforce collection of Texas franchise taxes.\n\n               Although not expressly stated in Chapter 171, it is logical that subsection\n       171.255(a) applies only to corporations that have failed to file a report or to pay a\n       tax or penalty as required by Texas law. That is, it follows that subsection 171.\n       255(a) applies when a corporation has its corporate privileges forfeited in Texas,\n       not in California. Here, NCI has not shown that subsection 171.255(a) applies to\n       Tri–State, a California corporation, whose corporate rights and privileges were\n       suspended by California authorities for noncompliance with California tax laws.\n       In addition, NCI has not offered any evidence showing that Tri–State’s corporate\n       privileges have been forfeited by Texas authorities for non-compliance with\n       Texas tax law. Thus, we conclude that NCI did not meet its burden to show that\n       Hollister and Bush are personally liable pursuant to Texas Tax Code subsection\n       171.255(a) for NCI’s claims against Tri–State.\n\nId. (internal citations omitted); see also In re Dodgin, No. 05–21729–RLJ–13, 2006 WL\n\n3069714, at *4 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. Oct. 26, 2006) (New Mexico law determined liability of\n\nofficers and directors, not section 171.255, where the charter of a New Mexico corporation was\n\nrevoked by the State of New Mexico for failing to pay franchise taxes).\n\n       In a more recent case, Widner Product Finishing Co. v. Southwood Door Co., No. 03–\n\n10–00188–CV, 2012 WL 677495, at *4 (Tex. App.—Austin 2012, pet. filed) (mem. op.), the\n\nplaintiff argued that a director and officer of a Mississippi corporation that should have\n\nregistered to do business in Texas was personally liable for the corporation’s debts. The court\n\nconcluded that section 171.255 of the Tax Code imposes personal liability on directors and\n\nofficers only when there is an actual forfeiture of corporate privileges under the Texas Tax Code.\n\nId. Since the Mississippi corporation in Widner never had any corporate privileges in Texas,\n\nthere was nothing to forfeit and personal liability could not be imposed under section 171.255:\n\n\n\n                                               –32–\n\f       Southwood simply never had corporate privileges in Texas, so we cannot treat it\n       as though it had (and forfeited) corporate privileges. Southwood may have\n       forfeited corporate privileges in its home state of Mississippi, but section 171.255\n       applies only when a corporation has forfeited its privileges in Texas. Id. Because\n       Southwood never had corporate privileges in Texas, Texas Tax Code section\n       171.255 cannot apply to the case at bar.\n\nId.\n\n       In the present case, appellee did not contend Nevada law held Johns personally liable. As\n\nin their brief on appeal, their summary judgment argument in the trial court regarding Johns’s\n\njoint and several liability was premised on section 171.255. But appellee has not shown that\n\nsection 171.255 applies to Sunetics, Inc., a Nevada corporation that was in “revocation” for\n\nnoncompliance with Nevada laws according to the Nevada Secretary of State’s “Certificate of\n\nExistence With Status of Revocation.” In addition, there is no summary judgment evidence of\n\nwhich we are aware showing that Sunetics, Inc.’s corporate privileges were forfeited by Texas\n\nauthorities for non-compliance with Texas law. Based on the record before us, we conclude\n\nappellee did not meet its burden of showing that Mark Johns is personally liable pursuant to\n\nsection 171.255. See Stiles v. Resolution Trust Corp., 867 S.W.2d 24, 26 (Tex. 1993) (stating\n\nthat appellate courts can affirm summary judgment based only on a ground expressly stated in\n\nthe motion for summary judgment granted by the trial court); Shih v. Tamisiea, 306 S.W.3d 939,\n\n946 (Tex. App.––Dallas 2010, no pet.) (noting that court could not consider appellees’ argument\n\n“because it was not raised below and an appellate court can affirm a summary judgment only on\n\nthe grounds expressly set out in the motion.”). Accordingly, we sustain appellants’ fifth issue, in\n\npart. We reverse the portion of the trial court’s judgment holding Mark Johns jointly and\n\nseverally liable for the $244,732.95 in legal fees and expenses attributable to the Sunetics\n\nlitigation, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                          6. Appellee’s Damages and Attorneys’ Fees\n\n\n\n                                              –33–\n\f       In their sixth issue, appellants contend the trial court erred by granting appellee’s\n\ntraditional summary judgment motion because appellee did not prove it was entitled to summary\n\njudgment regarding the amount of damages and attorneys’ fees awarded by the court, “given the\n\nredacted state of its attorney fee billings and the evidence of unreasonable legal services\n\npresented by the Affidavits of Mark Johns and Janet Randle.”\n\n                                      Appellee’s Damages\n\n       The damages sought by appellee in its fourth amended petition were liquidated damages.\n\nA claim is liquidated if the amount of damages may be accurately calculated by the trial court\n\nfrom the factual, as opposed to the conclusory, allegations in plaintiff’s petition and the\n\ninstrument in writing. See, e.g., Novosad v. Cunningham, 38 S.W.3d 767, 773 (Tex. App.––\n\nHouston [14th Dist] 2001, no pet.) (suit to recover amount due for professional services was a\n\nliquidated claim proven by written invoices attached to original petition); Mantis v. Resz, 5\n\nS.W.3d 388, 392 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth 1999, pet. denied), overruled on other grounds,\n\nSheldon v. Emergency Med. Consultants, 43 S.W.3d 701 (Tex. App.––Fort Worth 2001, no pet.)\n\n(in a suit on a sworn account, the petition with an attached sworn account and verified affidavit\n\nof the account was a liquidated claim proved by written instruments); Harris, N.A. v. Obregon,\n\nNo. 05–10–01349–CV, 2013 WL 3524153, at *4–5 (Tex. App.––Dallas July 11, 2013, no pet.)\n\n(mem. op.) (damages for suit on a sworn account claim were liquidated because pleading\n\nprovided requisite factual allegations to prove plaintiff’s claim).    The liquidated damages\n\nclaimed by appellee were established as a matter of law. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 93(10), 185.\n\nConsequently, appellants’ argument that appellee did not prove it was entitled to summary\n\njudgment regarding the amount of actual damages awarded by the trial court is unpersuasive.\n\n                                Section 38.001 Attorneys’ Fees\n\n\n\n\n                                              –34–\n\f         As for attorneys’ fees, the general rule is that litigants in Texas are responsible for their\n\nown attorneys’ fees and expenses in litigation. Ashford Partners, Ltd. v. ECO Res., Inc., 401\n\nS.W.3d 35, 41 (Tex. 2012). Under Texas law, a court may award attorneys’ fees only when\n\nauthorized by statute or by the parties’ contract. MBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co.,\n\n292 S.W.3d 660, 669 (Tex. 2009). Whether a party is entitled to seek an award of attorneys’ fees\n\nis a question of law that we review de novo. Holland v. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc., 1 S.W.3d 91, 94\n\n(Tex. 1999).\n\n         In its amended motion for partial summary judgment, and its second motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment filed after the trial court declined to grant summary judgment as to certain\n\nclaims and parties, appellee argued it was entitled to attorneys’ fees pursuant to section\n\n38.001(7), (8) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Section 38.001 provides, in part,\n\nthat a party may recover attorneys’ fees from an individual or a corporation, in addition to the\n\namount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for a suit on a sworn account or for an oral or\n\nwritten contract. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(7), (8). To recover attorneys’\n\nfees under section 38.001, the plaintiff must (1) prevail on a cause of action for which attorneys’\n\nfees are recoverable and (2) recover damages. Green Int’l v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 390 (Tex.\n\n1997).\n\n         Texas law does not require detailed billing records or other documentary evidence as a\n\nprerequisite to awarding attorneys’ fees. See, e.g., Tex. Commerce Bank, Nat’l Ass’n v. New, 3\n\nS.W.3d 515, 517–18 (Tex. 1999) (per curiam); Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. City of\n\nDripping Springs, 304 S.W.3d 871, 892–93 (Tex. App.—Austin 2010, pet. denied); In re A.B.P.,\n\n291 S.W.3d 91, 99 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.); Jarvis, 298 S.W.3d at 319. “It has\n\nconsistently been held that an attorney’s testimony about his experience, the total amount of fees,\n\nand the reasonableness of the fees charged is sufficient to support an award.” Metroplex Mailing\n\n                                                 –35–\n\fServs., L.L.C. and Jesse R. Marion v. RR Donnelley & Sons Co., 410 S.W.3d 889, 900 (Tex.\n\nApp.––Dallas 2013, no pet.) (citing In re A.B.P., 291 S.W.3d at 99).\n\n                              Shamoun’s Attorneys’ Fees Affidavit\n\n       As we previously noted, appellee’s second partial summary judgment motion was\n\nsupplemented by two Shamoun affidavits. One, attached to the motion as exhibit A, discussed,\n\namong other matters, the liability of Johns, individually, for the legal services, expenses and\n\ncosts associated with the Sunetics litigation, and the liability of WH Management for legal\n\nservices, expenses and costs associated with the Marlin litigation. The other affidavit, exhibit 4,\n\nwhich, as we have already noted, is not challenged on appeal, segregated the section 38.001\n\nattorneys’ fees claimed by appellee in the instant case. Paragraph six of this affidavit asserts:\n\n       I have worked on litigation matters in the past that have involved the same or\n       similar issues as those that exist in the case at bar. I have reviewed and am\n       familiar with all of the pleadings in this case. I have reviewed and am familiar\n       with all of the discovery conducted and produced in this case. I have personal\n       knowledge of the activities conducted in this case since its inception. I have also\n       reviewed the applicable billing statements accrued by Plaintiff throughout this\n       suit.\n\nShamoun segregated appellee’s attorneys’ fees for the Sunetics, Balch Springs, Marlin, and\n\nJohns custody litigation as follows: $53,207.17 was attributed to Sunetics, Inc. and Mark Johns\n\nfor the Sunetics litigation; $11,546.41 to Woodhaven Partners, Ltd., WH Management, Inc.,\n\nPMR Partners, and Mark Johns for the Balch Springs litigation; $18,853.30 to Woodhaven\n\nPartners, Ltd. and WH Management, Inc. for the Marlin litigation, and $23,456.65 to Mark Johns\n\nfor the custody litigation. Shamoun concluded with a case-by-case summary of what he believed\n\nwere reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees recoverable in this suit. He alleged that appellee\n\nwould incur an additional $20,000 in reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees in the event of an\n\nappeal to the court of appeals, $10,000 for an unsuccessful petition for review to the Texas\n\nSupreme Court, and $15,000 for full briefing and argument to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n                                                –36–\n\fShamoun asserted that all of these fees were reasonable and necessary and that his opinion on the\n\nreasonableness and necessity of the fees was based on the Arthur Andersen factors, which he lists\n\nin the affidavit. See Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex.\n\n1997) (providing a non-exclusive list of factors for the factfinder to consider when determining\n\nthe reasonableness of a fee).\n\n                                   No Controverting Summary Judgment Evidence\n\n           Appellants failed to controvert this testimony or provide any controverting summary\n\njudgment evidence regarding the attorneys’ fees requested by appellee. The reasonableness and\n\nnecessity of attorneys’ fees, as we discussed earlier, requires expert testimony. See, e.g., Twin\n\nCity Fire Ins., 223 S.W.3d at 770–71. Yet Mark Johns, who is not an attorney, could not testify\n\nregarding the reasonableness and necessity of attorneys’ fees, and appellants withdrew their\n\ndesignations of their two expert witnesses “as to testimony regarding the attorneys’ fees in this\n\ncase.” 10 Because appellants failed to raise an issue of fact regarding appellee’s section 38.001\n\nattorneys’ fees, the trial court did not err by awarding the attorneys’ fees sought by appellee.\n\n           But all fee claimants must segregate attorneys’ fees between claims for which they are\n\nrecoverable and claims for which they are not. Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d\n\n299, 311 (Tex. 2006). We have already determined that we must reverse and remand the portion\n\nof the trial court’s judgment holding Johns jointly and severally liable with Sunetics, Inc for the\n\n$244,732.95 in actual damages attributable to the Sunetics litigation. The trial court, moreover,\n\nheld Mark Johns jointly and severally liable with Sunetics, Inc. for the $53,207.17 in attorneys’\n\n           10\n              Appellants originally designated their lead attorney, Evan Lane (Van) Shaw, to testify regarding issues of attorneys’ fees in this\ncase. Appellants subsequently designated their other attorney, Janet Randle, to also testify regarding attorneys’ fees. On March 5, 2011, in a\nsupplemental response to appellee’s requests for disclosure, appellants answered “[n]one at this time” regarding their testifying experts. In a\nsubsequent March 29 “De-designation of Expert Witnesses,” appellants stated that they “hereby de-designate Van Shaw and Janet Randle as\nexpert witnesses in this case.” Appellants then proffered the affidavit of Janet Randle and attached materials as testimony in support of their\nresponse to appellee’s amended motion for partial summary judgment (filed May 11, 2011). At the same time, they filed a “First Supplement to\nDefendants’ De-designation of Expert Witnesses” that sought to amend their prior de-designation of expert witnesses as follows: “Defendants\nhereby de-designate Van Shaw and Janet Randle as expert witnesses in this case only as to testimony regarding the attorneys’ fees in this case.”\nAppellee moved to strike appellants’ supplement along with its objections to Janet Randle’s affidavit. In its order granting partial summary\njudgment, the trial court overruled appellee’s objections to the Randle affidavit and denied the motion to strike.\n\n\n                                                                    –37–\n\ffees and costs, and appellee’s summary judgment proof does not segregate those fees as to the\n\ntwo defendants. We thus sustain appellants’ sixth issue as to the $53,207.17 in section 38.001\n\nattorneys’ fees and costs attributable to the Sunetics litigation and remand that issue to the trial\n\ncourt for further proceedings. In all other respects, appellants’ sixth issue is overruled.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm the trial court’s judgment in part, and reverse and remand it in part. We\n\nreverse the portion of the trial court’s judgment holding Mark Johns jointly and severally liable\n\nwith Sunetics, Inc. for the $244,732.95 in actual damages attributable to the Sunetics litigation,\n\nand awarding appellee $53,207.17 in attorneys’ fees and costs, together with pre and post-\n\njudgment interest.    We remand those issues to the trial court for further proceedings. The\n\nremainder of the trial court’s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n111718F.P05\n\n\n\n                                                       /Lana Myers/\n                                                       LANA MYERS\n                                                       JUSTICE\n\n\n\n\n                                                –38–\n\f                                        S\n                               Court of Appeals\n                        Fifth District of Texas at Dallas\n                                      JUDGMENT\n\nWOODHAVEN PARTNERS, LTD., WH                        On Appeal from the County Court at Law\nMANAGEMENT, INC., MARK JOHNS,                       No. 4, Dallas County, Texas\nPMR PARTNERS I, LTD., SUNETICS                      Trial Court Cause No. CC-10-00907-C.\nINTERNATIONAL, L.P.

In six issues, appellants argue the trial\n\ncourt erred by (1) striking a summary judgment affidavit filed by appellant Mark Johns; (2)\n\ngranting appellee’s traditional motion for summary judgment; (3) granting appellee’s no-\n\nevidence summary judgment motion; (4) overruling appellants’ objections to the summary\n\njudgment affidavit filed by C. Gregory Shamoun; (5) finding Mark Johns jointly and severally\n\nliable with Sunetics International, Inc.; and (6) finding that appellee did not prove it was entitled\n\fto the damages and attorneys’ fees awarded by the trial court. We affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgment in part, and reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                       BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       This appeal arises from a lawsuit brought by appellee, a Dallas law firm, for non-payment\n\nof various attorneys’ fees incurred during four legal matters. In April of 2007, appellee was\n\nhired to represent appellant Sunetics International, Inc. (“Sunetics, Inc.,” unless otherwise\n\nindicated), in a complex patent infringement case against Lexington Lasercomb I.P.A.G. and\n\nLexington International, L.L.C. (the “Sunetics litigation”). The agreement was signed by Mark\n\nJohns, Sunetics, Inc.’s president and secretary. Also in April of 2007, appellee was hired to\n\nrepresent appellant Woodhaven Partners, Ltd., in a real estate litigation and contract dispute\n\nagainst Marlin Land Development, L.L.C. (the “Marlin litigation”). The agreement was signed\n\nby Johns, the president of Woodhaven Partners. In August of 2007, appellants Woodhaven\n\nPartners, Ltd., WH Management, Inc., PMR Partners I, Ltd., and Johns hired appellee to\n\nrepresent them in litigation involving claims brought by Balch Springs Development II, L.P. (the\n\n“Balch Springs litigation”). The agreement was signed by Johns as the authorized agent for\n\nPMR Partners, Woodhaven, WH Management, and by Johns individually. The following April,\n\nappellee was hired by Johns to represent him in proceedings involving the conservatorship of\n\nJohns’s child (the “Johns custody litigation”).\n\n       On February 10, 2010, appellee brought suit against Woodhaven Partners, Ltd., Mark\n\nJohns, WH Management, Inc., PMR Partners I, Ltd., Sunetics International, L.P., Sunetics\n\nInternational, Inc., and JCMJ Ventures, L.L.C. (collectively, “appellants”) asserting causes of\n\naction for sworn account, breach of contract, and, alternatively, promissory estoppel and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  –2–\n\fquantum meruit, and fraud and fraud in the inducement, 1 based on appellants’ failure to pay\n\nincurred attorneys’ fees pursuant to the retainer agreements. Appellants answered. Appellants\n\nMark Johns, Woodhaven Partners, Ltd., and WH Management counterclaimed against appellee\n\nfor breach of contract, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, violations of the Texas\n\nDeceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), and breach of fiduciary duty, alleging that appellee\n\novercharged appellants for legal services:\n\n               [Appellants] would show that [appellants] and [appellee] entered into an\n       agreement whereby [appellee] agreed to provide legal services to [appellants] at a\n       reasonable rate. Notwithstanding this agreement, [appellee] overcharged\n       [appellants] for the legal services in issue, as the billings [appellants] received\n       from [appellee] were not proper and were not accurate causing damages to\n       [appellants] in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\nAppellants also alleged affirmative defenses of ratification, waiver, fraud, estoppel, laches,\n\nunclean hands, set-off, prior material breach, and the economic loss rule.\n\n       On October 4, 2010, appellee filed a traditional and no-evidence motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment. The summary judgment motion was supported, in part, by an affidavit from\n\nC. Gregory Shamoun, appellee’s president and managing partner. After various pleadings were\n\nsupplemented and amended by the parties, appellants filed their response to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment and objected to Shamoun’s affidavit. Affidavits from Mark Johns and Janet\n\nRandle, one of the attorneys of record for appellants, were included with appellants’ response to\n\nappellee’s summary judgment motion.\n\n       After another round of amended and supplemented pleadings, appellee filed, on April 19,\n\n2011, an amended traditional and no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment. On May\n\n11, 2011, along with their response to the amended motion for partial summary judgment,\n\nappellants filed a “Supplement to All Existing Answers,” which purported to be a verified denial\n\n\n       1\n           The claims for fraud and fraudulent inducement were subsequently nonsuited.\n\n\n\n                                                                  –3–\n\fof appellee’s claim for suit on a sworn account. Appellee objected to and moved to strike Mark\n\nJohns’s and Janet Randle’s affidavits.\n\n         On June 2, 2011, the trial court granted, in part, appellee’s amended motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment. The trial court sustained appellee’s objections to Johns’s affidavit and\n\noverruled its objections to Janet Randle’s affidavit.       The court then concluded that, given\n\ndeficiencies in appellee’s pleadings and proof, granting summary judgment against all appellants\n\nwould be reversible error. The trial court thus granted summary judgment as to all of appellee’s\n\nclaims against (1) Sunetics, Inc. for the Sunetics litigation, and all of its affirmative defenses and\n\ncounterclaims; (2) Woodhaven Partners for the Marlin litigation, and all of its affirmative\n\ndefenses and counterclaims; (3) Woodhaven Partners, WH Management, PMR Partners, and\n\nJohns for the Balch Springs litigation, and all of their affirmative defenses and counterclaims;\n\nand (4) Johns, individually, for the Johns custody litigation, and all of his affirmative defenses\n\nand counterclaims. The trial court did not grant summary judgment against Johns for the\n\nSunetics litigation or against WH Management for the Marlin litigation. The trial court also\n\ndeclined to award attorneys’ fees because it could not determine the appropriate amount of fees\n\nto award, given that appellee’s “attorney’s fees affidavit involves fees against certain Defendants\n\nagainst whom Judgment has not been achieved,” and that there was no “adequate segregation of\n\nfees.”\n\n         After supplementing its Fourth Amended Petition on June 30, 2011, appellee filed a\n\nsecond summary judgment motion. The motion sought attorneys’ fees and to hold Johns jointly\n\nand severally liable with Sunetics, Inc. for the Sunetics litigation, and WH Management jointly\n\nand severally with Woodhaven for the Marlin litigation. It was supported by an affidavit filed by\n\nShamoun, along with numerous attached documents. Appellee also provided a segregation of its\n\nattorneys’ fees in the Marlin and Sunetics litigation, supported by a second Shamoun affidavit.\n\n                                                 –4–\n\fIn their response, appellants objected to Shamoun’s first affidavit and moved to strike certain\n\nexhibits that accompanied the affidavit.\n\n          In the final judgment signed on September 29, 2011, the trial court granted appellee’s\n\nsecond motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The court struck one sentence of the\n\nShamoun affidavit, but overruled all of appellants’ other objections. The court’s final judgment\n\nfound, inter alia, (1) against Sunetics, Inc. and Mark Johns, jointly and severally, for $244,732.95\n\nin actual damages based on the Sunetics litigation, and $53,207.17 in attorneys’ fees; (2) against\n\nWoodhaven Partners and WH Management, jointly and severally, for $61,163.46 in actual\n\ndamages attributable to the Marlin litigation, and $18,853.30 in attorneys’ fees; (3) against\n\nWoodhaven Partners, WH Management, PMR Partners, and Mark Johns, jointly and severally,\n\nfor $11,102.38 in actual damages based on the Balch Springs litigation, and $11,546.41 in\n\nattorneys’ fees; and (4) against Mark Johns, individually, for $89,773.89 in actual damages\n\nattributable to the Johns custody litigation, and $23,456.65 in attorneys’ fees. Appellants filed a\n\nmotion for new trial that was overruled by operation of law, followed by the instant notice of\n\nappeal.\n\n                                            DISCUSSION\n\n                                     1. Affidavit of Mark Johns\n\n          In their first issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by striking the affidavit\n\ntestimony of Mark Johns because the testimony “was admissible under governing case law and\n\nthe applicable retainer agreements.”\n\n                                             Background\n\n          After appellee filed its traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment seeking\n\nsummary judgment as to its causes of action and appellants’ counterclaims, appellants’ response\n\nincluded an affidavit from Mark Johns disputing the reasonableness and necessity of the\n\n                                                 –5–\n\fattorneys’ fees that are the subject of this lawsuit. Appellee moved to strike paragraphs 4, 8, 12,\n\nand 16 of the Johns affidavit as it applied to the reasonableness and necessity of the attorneys’\n\nfees and services.\n\n       In each of the challenged paragraphs, Johns began by quoting the following language that\n\nis found in all of the relevant retainer agreements between appellants and appellee:\n\n       For purposes of this Engagement Letter, the Engagement means rendering of\n       reasonable and necessary legal services including, without limitation, conducting\n       a preliminary investigation; drafting documents, correspondence and pleadings;\n       motion practice; conducting and defending discovery; attending mediation and\n       trial; and drafting settlement documents. Reasonable and necessary legal services\n       shall be those which [the client] and [appellee] decide are reasonable and\n       necessary to perform the Engagement. . . [EMPHASIS ADDED].\n\nJohns stated that he did “not agree that the invoices sent in this case to me by [appellee] were all\n\nfor reasonable and necessary legal services that were reasonable and necessary to perform the\n\nEngagement.” He then noted that appellee “agreed that ‘Reasonable and necessary legal services\n\nshall be those which Client and [appellee] decide are reasonable and necessary,’” and added that\n\nhe did “not agree that the services provided by [appellee] were reasonable and necessary to\n\nperform the Engagement in this matter.” He reviewed individual invoices for various legal\n\nservices, after which he stated that the claims did “not reflect invoices for the legal services I\n\nbelieve were all reasonable and necessary,” and that he did not believe all of the services for\n\nwhich he was billed by appellee “were reasonable and necessary services as reflected above.”\n\n       Appellee’s motion to strike argued that Johns is not an attorney and that his assertions\n\nregarding the reasonableness and necessity of attorneys’ fees are not competent summary\n\njudgment evidence. The trial court sustained appellee’s objections in its order partially granting\n\nsummary judgment, finding:\n\n       Plaintiff’s Objections to the Johns Affidavit are SUSTAINED. Plaintiff is correct\n       that Johns is not a competent or qualified witness to offer an expert opinion as to\n       the reasonableness and necessity of attorney’s fees. In that respect, Plaintiff’s\n       objection is SUSTAINED, and paragraphs 4, 8, 12, and 16 are struck as expert\n                                                –6–\n\f       opinion evidence if being offered by Defendants to prove Plaintiff’s attorneys[’]\n       fees were not reasonable and necessary.\n\n                                        Standard of Review\n\n       Inclusion or exclusion of summary judgment evidence is a matter committed to the trial\n\ncourt’s discretion.

Greenberg Peden, P.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895367\"><a href=\"/opinion/895367/anglo-dutch-petroleum-v-greenberg-peden/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2011), combined with the above-noted\n\nterms of the retainer agreements between appellants and appellee, gave Mark Johns the right to\n\ntestify as to his determination of the reasonableness and necessity of legal services. In particular,\n\nappellants cite this portion of the Anglo-Dutch Petroleum opinion:\n\n       Only reasonable clarity is required, not perfection; not every dispute over the\n       contract’s meaning must be resolved against the lawyer. But the object is that the\n       client be informed, and thus whether the lawyer has been reasonably clear must be\n       determined from the client’s perspective. Accordingly, we agree with the\n       Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers that “[a] tribunal should\n       construe a contract between client and lawyer as a reasonable person in the\n       circumstances of the client would have construed it.”\n\nId. at 451 (quoting RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS, § 18(2)).\n\n                                                –7–\n\f       There are several problems with this argument. To begin with, the issue in Anglo-Dutch\n\nPetroleum was whether the fee agreement letter that the client accepted was with the law firm of\n\nGreenberg Peden, P.C., or with the individual attorney, when the letter was written on firm\n\nletterhead and signed on behalf of the firm. Id. at 446. The dispute, in other words, was whether\n\nthe attorneys’ fee agreement was ambiguous. Id. The concept of viewing the agreement from\n\nthe client’s perspective, as applied, concerned whether the facts and circumstances viewed from\n\nthe client’s perspective indicated he was contracting with the firm and not the individual lawyer.\n\nId. at 449–453. In the present case, neither party below raised an issue of ambiguity that would\n\nrequire the fee agreements to be construed or interpreted by the court. Appellants are arguing,\n\ninstead, that Johns’s lay testimony is admissible in order to contest the reasonableness and\n\nnecessity of the attorneys’ fees in the underlying litigation. No reasonable interpretation of\n\nAnglo-Dutch Petroleum supports such an argument.\n\n       Texas law is clear that “[t]he issue of reasonableness and necessity of attorney’s fees\n\nrequires expert testimony.” Twin City Fire Ins.

Appellee’s Amended Traditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n\n       In their second issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting appellee’s\n\namended traditional motion for partial summary judgment because appellee did not prove it was\n\nentitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, “given the questions of fact raised in Mark\n\nJohns’s affidavit and Janet Randle’s affidavit as to [appellee’s] breach of contract on multiple\n\nretainer agreements.”    Appellee responds that the traditional summary judgment should be\n\naffirmed as to its claims against appellants because it proved there was no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact regarding its cause of action for suit on a sworn account––one of the grounds on\n\nwhich it moved for traditional summary judgment.\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       We review the trial court’s summary judgment de novo.

Shamoun declared that, after “[a]ll just and lawful offsets,\n\npayments and credits” were applied, appellee was owed $244,732.95 on the account for the\n\nSunetics litigation; $61,163.46 for the Marlin litigation; $11,102.38 for the Balch Springs\n\nlitigation; and $89,773.89 for the Johns custody litigation. Shamoun further declared that he had\n\npersonal knowledge of all the facts set forth in the petition and verification, that the facts\n\ncontained “therein and herein” were true and correct, and that the claims asserted were for work\n\n                                              –11–\n\fperformed and were “just and true.” Attached to the affidavit are copies of lengthy billing\n\ninvoices from appellee that are itemized according to the date of each charge, the initials of the\n\nindividual (identified as “Staff”) who performed the service, a brief description of the work\n\nperformed, 2 the hours billed, the billing rate, and the charges.\n\n                                                        Appellants’ Response\n\n           Along with their response to appellee’s amended motion for partial summary judgment,\n\nappellants filed “Defendants’ Supplement to All Existing Answers,” which denied that appellants\n\nare “indebted for the amount alleged in Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Petition pursuant to Rules\n\n93(10) and 185 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.” Appellants quoted rules 93(10) and 185,\n\nafter which they denied “the sworn account made the basis of Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended\n\nPetition pursuant to Rules 93(10) and 185 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.” Appellants\n\nthen quoted rules 93(10) and 185 a second time.

Id. at 268. The court noted that “the purpose of a verified\n\nspecific denial is to point out the manner in which the plaintiff’s allegations within the petition\n\nare not true. Otherwise neither the court nor the opposing party is apprised of the fact issue that\n\nnecessitates further litigation.” Id. at 267. Because the defendant’s answer “fail[ed] to address\n\nthe facts on which he intend[ed] to rebut the plaintiff’s affidavit,” the court concluded it did not\n\ncomply with rules 185 and 93(10), and, therefore, could not defeat summary judgment.

An appellant cannot negate all possible grounds upon which a\n\nsummary judgment could have been granted merely by declaring that the appeal is intended to\n\nchallenge all possible grounds. See Jarvis, 298 S.W.3d at 313 n.8. The appellant “must also\n\nprovide appropriate arguments within that issue negating all possible grounds upon which\n\nsummary judgment could have been granted.” See id. Appellants have not done this. Because\n\nthey failed to challenge appellee’s suit on a sworn account claim on appeal, we could affirm the\n\ntrial court’s traditional summary judgment in appellee’s favor on that basis alone. See Staton,\n\n345 S.W.3d at 733; Jarvis, 298 S.W.3d at 314.\n\n           Nevertheless, we note that appellee’s sworn account affidavit attached to its petition\n\ncontains all of the necessary elements.

The attached account invoices\n\n\n           3\n               In its amended traditional and no-evidence motion for partial summary judgment, appellee argued that because appellants failed to\nfile a sufficient verified denial in compliance with rules 185 and 93(10), and did not sufficiently deny the accounts on which the sworn account\nclaim was filed, there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the suit on a sworn account claim. This motion was actually filed several\nweeks before appellants’ “Supplement to All Existing Answers,” but there is no question that the sufficiency of appellants’ verified denial was\nbefore the trial court. Appellants’ counsel acknowledged during oral argument that appellee challenged the sufficiency of the verified denial in\nthe trial court.\n\n           4\n               The three-volume electronic clerk’s record filed in this case includes over 3,000 pages.\n\n\n\n                                                                        –15–\n\finclude information reflecting the date of each charge, initials of the individual who performed\n\nthe service, a brief description of the work performed, hours billed, the billing rate, and the\n\nspecific charges. Thus, appellee’s verified pleading was prima facie proof of appellants’ debts.\n\nAppellants’ broad, generalized denial, proffered as a “verified denial,” did not constitute a proper\n\ndenial of the sworn account. It was, at most, a verified general denial, which is insufficient to\n\nrebut the evidentiary effect of appellee’s sworn account pleadings and put appellee to its proof.\n\n       Additionally, “even when a defendant verifies its sworn denial to a suit on a sworn\n\naccount, a plaintiff may properly obtain summary judgment on its sworn account by filing ‘legal\n\nand competent summary judgment evidence establishing the validity of its claim as a matter of\n\nlaw.’” Andy’s Sunmart # 352, Inc. v.

Appellee did not move for summary\n\njudgment solely on the pleadings; it also moved for summary judgment on the grounds it had\n\nproven its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law based on the summary judgment evidence.\n\nAs part of its amended partial summary judgment motion, appellee included an affidavit from\n\nShamoun stating that the firm was hired to represent various appellants on several legal matters,\n\n“including a custody dispute, real estate and contract disputes, and a complex patent\n\ninfringement case,” and that Mark Johns was appellee’s “primary contact and the corporate\n\nrepresentative of each of the entity Defendants, with whom [appellee] dealt relative to the\n\nunderlying litigation matters.” Shamoun declared that, exclusive of interest, a total principal\n\nbalance of $244,732.95 was due and payable for legal services furnished “to and for the Sunetics\n\n                                               –16–\n\fDefendants”; $61,163.46 for legal services furnished “to and for the Marlin Defendants”;\n\n$11,102.38 for legal services furnished “to and for the Balch Springs Defendants”; and\n\n$89,773.89 for legal services furnished “to and for Johns.” The affidavit further stated that\n\nappellee provided the “Sunetics Defendants,” “Marlin Defendants, “Balch Springs Defendants”\n\nand Johns with “regular statements of account” that set forth the “time and expenses incurred in\n\nrendering legal services” and that, on several occasions, it made demand on appellants for\n\npayment on the outstanding balances due on these accounts, but appellants “failed and refused to\n\npay.” “All lawful offsets, payments and credits have been applied” to the accounts, and they\n\nremain unpaid. Appended to the affidavit were, according to the affidavit, “original or exact\n\nduplicates of the original” billing invoices. 5\n\n             In their response, apart from proclaiming that their verified denial was sufficient to defeat\n\nappellee’s sworn account claim, appellants cited no competent summary judgment evidence in\n\nresponse to appellee’s summary judgment evidence in support of its sworn account claim.

In particular, appellee cited excerpts\n\nfrom Mark Johns’s deposition to argue that the only evidence of actual damages showed\n\nappellants’ damages were based on attorneys’ fees, court costs, time, and effort spent defending\n\nagainst appellee’s claims:\n\n\n\n\n                                               –18–\n\f       Q.

They also include time spent; is that right?\n\n       A. Yes, sir.\n\nIn their response to the amended motion for partial summary judgment, appellants asserted:\n\n       Defendants argue herein that the motions should be denied on the grounds that\n       Plaintiff has not met its burden of establishing, as a matter of law, that they are\n       entitled to prevail on summary judgment, as questions of material fact as to: (1)\n       which parties were signatories to the contracts in question; and (2) which, if any,\n       party breached the agreement first; and (3) the amount of monies, if any, owed.\n\nThey also argued:\n\n       There are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the Plaintiff breached the\n       agreement by failing to submit invoices to each Defendant timely, whether those\n       invoices reflected the reasonable services decided on by both Defendant and\n       Plaintiff as required by each agreement, whether the Defendants being sued on\n       said agreement were in fact parties to the agreement, and whether the Plaintiff\n       who signed the agreement is in fact the same plaintiff in this action, or has the\n       same rights as the Plaintiff who signed the agreements in question.\n\nAppellants, however, did not address appellee’s contentions regarding damages or attempt to\n\nsubstantiate the “actual damages” elements of their counterclaims, and on appeal they fail to\n\npoint to any damages they suffered as a result of appellee’s conduct––apart from the incurring of\n\nattorneys’ fees and legal expenses.\n\n                         Attorneys’ Fees Not Recoverable as Damages\n\n       Texas law distinguishes between the recovery of attorneys’ fees as actual damages and\n\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees incident to the recovery of other actual damages.

Issues raised on appeal, but not briefed, are waived. See, e.g., Haidar, 239\n\nS.W.3d at 927.\n\n           Furthermore, assuming appellants’ argument was not waived, the summary judgment\n\nevidence in this case shows that the only damages stated by appellants consist of legal fees and\n\nexpenses they incurred in defending against this lawsuit brought by appellee and in prosecuting\n\ntheir counterclaims.              Well-settled law recognizes that attorneys’ fees and expenses are not\n\nrecoverable as damages in and of themselves. See, e.g., Tana, 104 S.W.3d at 82; Haden, 332\n\nS.W.3d at 521.

See Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 240. For these reasons, we conclude the trial court\n\nproperly granted no-evidence summary judgment in appellee’s favor based on the absence of a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding the damages element of appellants’ counterclaims.

Gregory Shamoun\n\n           In their fourth issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by overruling appellants’\n\nobjection to the affidavit of C. Gregory Shamoun and accompanying exhibits, and subsequently\n\nallowing into evidence “hearsay and inadmissible redacted entries of attorney billings from\n\nwhich no evidence of work was able to be determined for purposes of reasonableness of services\n\nto support [appellee’s] traditional summary judgment.” Appellants specifically challenge the\n\n           6\n              The trial court also granted summary judgment for appellee on appellants’ affirmative defenses of ratification, waiver, fraud,\nestoppel, laches, unclean hands, set off, prior material breach, and the economic loss rule. Appellants do not raise any of these issues on appeal.\nAccordingly, we do not address them. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n\n\n                                                                     –24–\n\ffollowing documents attached to Shamoun’s affidavit: (1) redacted invoices for legal services\n\nand (2) information obtained over the internet from the Texas Secretary of State and Nevada\n\nSecretary of State websites.\n\n                                                                Background\n\n           The trial court initially granted appellee’s amended motion for partial summary judgment\n\non all of appellee’s causes of action, and ruled against appellants on their affirmative defenses\n\nand counterclaims. The trial court, however, did not grant summary judgment in its entirety\n\nagainst all appellants, nor did it award attorneys’ fees. Appellee then filed a second motion for\n\npartial summary judgment arguing that Johns should be held individually liable under Texas law\n\nfor the unpaid legal services and costs associated with the Sunetics litigation, and that WH\n\nManagement should be jointly and severally liable as a general partner of Woodhaven, against\n\nwhom summary judgment had already been granted, for the unpaid legal services and costs\n\nassociated with the Marlin litigation. The second summary judgment motion also segregated\n\nappellee’s section 38.001 attorneys’ fees for the current lawsuit.\n\n           Appellee’s second partial summary judgment motion included two additional affidavits\n\nfrom Shamoun––attached to the motion as exhibits “A” and “4.” Only one of these affidavits,\n\nexhibit A, is challenged on appeal. 7 In the exhibit A affidavit, after stating he had “personal\n\nknowledge of all facts set forth herein,” Shamoun attested that he was the firm’s president and\n\nmanaging partner and had care, custody, and control of the documents attached to the affidavit,\n\nwhich he alleged were “the original or exact duplicates of the original.” 8 Those documents\n\n\n           7\n              When they objected to Shamoun’s affidavit in the trial court, appellants did not specify whether they were objecting to the exhibit A\naffidavit, the exhibit 4 affidavit, or both. On appeal, however, appellants limit the discussion in their brief to the exhibit A affidavit and\naccompanying documents. They do not challenge the other Shamoun affidavit, exhibit 4, which is discussed in part six of this opinion.\nConsequently, to the extent appellants are contending they objected in the trial court to the exhibit 4 affidavit, and that the trial court erred by\noverruling those objections, that issue has been waived for inadequate briefing. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n           8\n               Paragraph 2 of the affidavit reads as follows:\n\n\n\n                                                                      –25–\n\fincluded lengthy attorneys’ fee invoices and billing statements for the Sunetics and Marlin\n\nlitigation, attached to the affidavit as exhibits A-2, A-3, A-5, and A-6. Exhibit A-2 contained\n\ntwo revised invoices totaling $244,732.95 in unpaid bills for legal services provided to Sunetics,\n\nInc.––charges that Shamoun stated were attributable to the Sunetics litigation. Exhibit A-5\n\ncontained a revised invoice for $61,163.46 in unpaid charges for legal services provided to\n\nWoodhaven Partners and WH Management––charges that Shamoun attested were attributable to\n\nthe Marlin litigation. Each invoice was itemized according to the date of the charge, a brief\n\ndescription of the charge, the billable hours, the billing rate, and the specific charge. As with the\n\ninvoices that accompanied appellee’s verified petition, the descriptions in these documents of the\n\nwork performed were redacted or “blacked out” save for a few words describing the activity\n\nbeing performed, e.g. “draft and revise,” “review,” “teleconference,” “research,” “copying,”\n\n“filing,” etc., with the specific nature of the work performed being redacted. Exhibits A-3 and\n\nA-6 contained, among other documents, unrevised invoices for the Sunetics and Marlin\n\nlitigation; the descriptions in these documents of the work performed were entirely redacted.\n\n       Also attached to Shamoun’s exhibit A affidavit, as exhibits A-10, A-11, and A-12, were\n\ndocuments obtained over the internet from the websites for the Texas Secretary of State and the\n\nNevada Secretary of State. These documents were offered in support of appellee’s argument that\n\nJohns should be held individually liable under section 171.255 of the Texas Tax Code, which\n\nimposes a corporation’s liability on the corporation’s directors and officers during a period of\n\nforfeiture of corporate privileges and for failing to file franchise reports. See TEX. TAX CODE\n\n\n       I have been and am the president of the managing partner of Shamoun & Norman, LLP f/k/a Shamoun Klatsky Norman\n       (“S&N”), Plaintiff in the above-styled suit. I have care, custody, and control of records concerning the accounts of each of\n       the various Defendants in the above-styled and numbered cause. Attached hereto are 221 pages of records from S&N.\n       These said 221 pages of records are kept by S&N in the regular course of business, and it was the regular course of\n       business of S&N for an employee or representative of S&N, with knowledge of the act, event, condition, opinion, or\n       diagnosis, recorded to make the record or to transmit information thereof to be included in such record; and the record was\n       made at or near the time or reasonably soon thereafter. The records attached hereto are the original or exact duplicates of\n       the original.\n\n\n\n                                                                 –26–\n\fANN. § 171.255. Appellee argued that, based on this statute, Johns should be held individually\n\nliable for the unpaid legal fees and costs associated with the Sunetics litigation. The last two\n\nparagraphs of the affidavit, which discuss the Secretary of State documents, assert that appellee\n\nused public information obtained only and directly from the Texas Secretary of State and Nevada\n\nSecretary of State websites and online record repositories, and that this information was retrieved\n\nby “competent computer operators who followed careful procedures by printing” the images of\n\nthe websites directly to a printer.\n\n                                      Appellants’ Objections\n\n        In their “Objection to Affidavit of C. Gregory Shamoun and Accompanying Exhibits,”\n\npart of appellants’ response to appellee’s second motion for partial summary judgment, they\n\nbrought the following objections:\n\n                Defendants object to the Affidavit of C. Gregory Shamoun because Mr.\n        Shamoun does not establish a foundation for testifying as to the work performed.\n        He merely states that he is the managing partner of the firm in question but has no\n        testimony regarding his work with the client during the period in question. In\n        addition, Plaintiff objects to the legal conclusions regarding “jointly and\n        severally” as there is no such language in the contract, and Mr. Shamoun is\n        testifying as to legal conclusions that are contradicted by the express language of\n        the contract. As such, his affidavit lacks the proper foundation to testify as to the\n        reasonableness and necessity of the work provided, and as to any intent on the\n        part of any defendant to be jointly and severally liable for any work. The\n        contracts at issue speak for themselves, and Plaintiff objects to the “parole”\n        evidence Mr. Shamoun attempts to proffer in his affidavit.\n\nAppellants also objected to exhibits A-2, A-3, A-5, and A-6 and moved to strike them because\n\nthey were “redacted,” thus making the exhibits “void of any content and insufficient to establish\n\nthe reasonableness of any work or time worked.”\n\n        On appeal, appellants contend Shamoun’s affidavit “did not lay a proper foundation for\n\nMr. Shamoun to authenticate the exhibits that were attached.” They argue Shamoun was “an\n\ninterested witness” and that his testimony “was of such a nature that it could not be readily\n\ncontradicted if untrue, given the redacted state of the billing.”        Appellants further argue\n                                               –27–\n\fShamoun’s affidavit was “self-serving” because “[h]is testimony is based upon redacted billing\n\nentries. . . that were impossible for the Court to read much less evaluate.” Appellants also take\n\nissue with Shamoun’s assertion that the billing records attached to the affidavit are “the original\n\nor exact duplicates of the original.” Appellants claim the documents “do not reflect the legal\n\nservices, as they are completely redacted.” 9\n\n           When appellants objected to Shamoun’s affidavit in the trial court, they did not argue he\n\nwas an interested witness. An objection asserting that an affiant is an interested witness is an\n\nobjection to a defect in the form of an affidavit, and must be preserved in the trial court. See\n\nStrother v.

An objection that an affidavit failed to establish the basis for an affiant’s\n\n\n           9\n              The trial court sustained one of appellants’ trial objections, striking “sentence 3 of paragraph 3 as to the ‘jointly and severally’\nlanguage therein.” The sentence read as follows: “S&N rendered legal services to the Sunetics Defendants jointly and severally pursuant to\nS&N’s agreement with the Sunetics Defendants and in full performance of such agreement.” The ruling is not challenged on appeal.\n           Additionally, we note that appellants’ “Objection to Affidavit of C. Gregory Shamoun and Accompanying Exhibits” also objected to\nexhibits A-10, A-11, and A-12, the Secretary of State documents. Because of our conclusion in part five of this opinion reversing and remanding\nthe portion of the trial court’s judgment holding Mark Johns jointly and severally liable for the $244,732.95 in underlying attorneys’ fees and\nexpenses attributable to the Sunetics litigation, the only issue raised on appeal for which the Secretary of State documents have any relevance, we\nwill not address appellants’ objections to those exhibits.

He did not detail his work for the clients during the periods in question. But he stated\n\nthat he was appellee’s managing partner, that appellee was hired by Sunetics, Inc. and Johns to\n\nrepresent them during the Sunetics litigation, and by Woodhaven Partners and WH Management\n\nto represent them during the Marlin litigation, that the legal services were provided pursuant to\n\nthe specific fee agreements, and that appellee provided the legal services reflected in the attached\n\ninvoices.

We\n\noverrule appellants’ fourth issue.\n\n                           5. Mark Johns’s Joint and Several Liability\n\n        In their fifth issue, appellants contend the trial court erred by finding Mark Johns jointly\n\nliable with Sunetics, Inc. for the Sunetics litigation attorneys’ fees and expenses because the\n\nevidence was insufficient to establish Sunetics, Inc.’s violation of any law.\n\n        At issue is the part of the trial court’s final judgment finding Johns, as an individual,\n\njointly and severally liable with Sunetics, Inc. for the $244,732.95 in actual damages attributable\n\nto the Sunetics litigation, together with reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees and costs and\n\npre and post-judgment interest. In its second motion for partial summary judgment, appellee\n\nargued that Johns, as the president and secretary of Sunetics, was jointly and severally liable for\n\nits debts because of Sunetics, Inc.’s forfeiture of corporate privileges (i.e., “Johns is jointly and\n\nseverally liable for the debts of Sunetics, Inc. as a result of Sunetics, Inc.’s forfeiture of corporate\n\nprivileges under Texas Tax Code § 171.255.”).\n\n        Section 171.255 provides:\n\n        (a) If the corporate privileges of a corporation are forfeited for the failure to file a\n        report or pay a tax or penalty, each director or officer of the corporation is liable\n        for each debt of the corporation that is created or incurred in this state after the\n        date on which the report, tax, or penalty is due and before the corporate privileges\n        are revived. The liability includes liability for any tax or penalty imposed by this\n        chapter on the corporation that becomes due and payable after the date of the\n        forfeiture.\n\n        (b) The liability of a director or officer is in the same manner and to the same\n        extent as if the director or officer were a partner and the corporation were a\n        partnership.\n\n        (c) A director or officer is not liable for a debt of the corporation if the director or\n        officer shows that the debt was created or incurred: (1) over the director’s\n        objection; or (2) without the director’s knowledge and that the exercise of\n        reasonable diligence to become acquainted with the affairs of the corporation\n        would not have revealed the intention to create the debt.\n\n                                                 –30–\n\f        (d) If a corporation’s charter or certificate of authority and its corporate\n       privileges are forfeited and revived under this chapter, the liability under this\n       section of a director or officer of the corporation is not affected by the revival of\n       the charter or certificate and the corporate privileges.\n\nTEX.

App.––Dallas 2008, no pet.).\n\n       The problem with appellee’s reliance on this statute is that, as appellee acknowledged in\n\nits second motion for partial summary judgment, Sunetics, Inc. filed its articles of incorporation\n\nin Nevada on March 3, 2005. As part of its summary judgment motion, appellee cited various\n\nprovisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes to argue that Nevada law, like Texas, requires\n\ncorporations to file annual forms that include the names and addresses of officers and directors.\n\nSee NEV. REV. STAT. § 78.150. This “annual list” must be filed “on or before the last day of the\n\nmonth in which the anniversary date of incorporation occurs each year.” Id. § 78.150(2). Failure\n\nto file the annual forms results in revocation of the corporate charter and a forfeiture of its right\n\nto transact business. See id. § 78.175(2). Moreover a document from the Nevada Secretary of\n\nState that is part of appellee’s summary judgment proof––a “Certificate of Existence With Status\n\nof Revocation” for Sunetics, Inc.––shows that Sunetics failed to timely file its annual list or pay\n\nthe required fee, and that it was in “revocation” under Nevada law as of April 1, 2010, for failing\n\nto file the annual list of officers and directors and designated agent for the period March 2009 to\n\nMarch 2010, as required by the Nevada Revised Statutes.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, no pet.), the court concluded that section 171.255 of the\n\nTexas Tax Code did not apply to a corporation whose privileges were suspended in another state\n\nfor nonpayment of taxes in that jurisdiction. Id. at 251–52. The court noted that “[i]t is well-\n\nsettled that section 171.255 must be strictly construed to protect those individuals against whom\n\n\n\n                                               –31–\n\fliability is sought because it is penal in nature and cannot be extended beyond the clear meaning\n\nof its language.” Id. at 251. The court then stated:\n\n              Chapter 171 of the Tax Code, of which section 171.255 is part, governs\n       franchise taxation in Texas. Franchise taxes governed by that chapter are taxes on\n       the privilege of transacting business within Texas. As Texas courts have\n       recognized, section 171.255 is a revenue measure, the purpose of which is to\n       enforce collection of Texas franchise taxes.\n\n               Although not expressly stated in Chapter 171, it is logical that subsection\n       171.255(a) applies only to corporations that have failed to file a report or to pay a\n       tax or penalty as required by Texas law. That is, it follows that subsection 171.\n       255(a) applies when a corporation has its corporate privileges forfeited in Texas,\n       not in California. Here, NCI has not shown that subsection 171.255(a) applies to\n       Tri–State, a California corporation, whose corporate rights and privileges were\n       suspended by California authorities for noncompliance with California tax laws.\n       In addition, NCI has not offered any evidence showing that Tri–State’s corporate\n       privileges have been forfeited by Texas authorities for non-compliance with\n       Texas tax law. Thus, we conclude that NCI did not meet its burden to show that\n       Hollister and Bush are personally liable pursuant to Texas Tax Code subsection\n       171.255(a) for NCI’s claims against Tri–State.\n\nId.

The court\n\nconcluded that section 171.255 of the Tax Code imposes personal liability on directors and\n\nofficers only when there is an actual forfeiture of corporate privileges under the Texas Tax Code.\n\nId. Since the Mississippi corporation in Widner never had any corporate privileges in Texas,\n\nthere was nothing to forfeit and personal liability could not be imposed under section 171.255:\n\n\n\n                                               –32–\n\f       Southwood simply never had corporate privileges in Texas, so we cannot treat it\n       as though it had (and forfeited) corporate privileges. Southwood may have\n       forfeited corporate privileges in its home state of Mississippi, but section 171.255\n       applies only when a corporation has forfeited its privileges in Texas. Id. Because\n       Southwood never had corporate privileges in Texas, Texas Tax Code section\n       171.255 cannot apply to the case at bar.\n\nId.\n\n       In the present case, appellee did not contend Nevada law held Johns personally liable. As\n\nin their brief on appeal, their summary judgment argument in the trial court regarding Johns’s\n\njoint and several liability was premised on section 171.255. But appellee has not shown that\n\nsection 171.255 applies to Sunetics, Inc., a Nevada corporation that was in “revocation” for\n\nnoncompliance with Nevada laws according to the Nevada Secretary of State’s “Certificate of\n\nExistence With Status of Revocation.” In addition, there is no summary judgment evidence of\n\nwhich we are aware showing that Sunetics, Inc.’s corporate privileges were forfeited by Texas\n\nauthorities for non-compliance with Texas law.

One, attached to the motion as exhibit A, discussed,\n\namong other matters, the liability of Johns, individually, for the legal services, expenses and\n\ncosts associated with the Sunetics litigation, and the liability of WH Management for legal\n\nservices, expenses and costs associated with the Marlin litigation. The other affidavit, exhibit 4,\n\nwhich, as we have already noted, is not challenged on appeal, segregated the section 38.001\n\nattorneys’ fees claimed by appellee in the instant case. Paragraph six of this affidavit asserts:\n\n       I have worked on litigation matters in the past that have involved the same or\n       similar issues as those that exist in the case at bar. I have reviewed and am\n       familiar with all of the pleadings in this case. I have reviewed and am familiar\n       with all of the discovery conducted and produced in this case. I have personal\n       knowledge of the activities conducted in this case since its inception. I have also\n       reviewed the applicable billing statements accrued by Plaintiff throughout this\n       suit.\n\nShamoun segregated appellee’s attorneys’ fees for the Sunetics, Balch Springs, Marlin, and\n\nJohns custody litigation as follows: $53,207.17 was attributed to Sunetics, Inc. and Mark Johns\n\nfor the Sunetics litigation; $11,546.41 to Woodhaven Partners, Ltd., WH Management, Inc.,\n\nPMR Partners, and Mark Johns for the Balch Springs litigation; $18,853.30 to Woodhaven\n\nPartners, Ltd. and WH Management, Inc. for the Marlin litigation, and $23,456.65 to Mark Johns\n\nfor the custody litigation. Shamoun concluded with a case-by-case summary of what he believed\n\nwere reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees recoverable in this suit. He alleged that appellee\n\nwould incur an additional $20,000 in reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees in the event of an\n\nappeal to the court of appeals, $10,000 for an unsuccessful petition for review to the Texas\n\nSupreme Court, and $15,000 for full briefing and argument to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n                                                –36–\n\fShamoun asserted that all of these fees were reasonable and necessary and that his opinion on the\n\nreasonableness and necessity of the fees was based on the Arthur Andersen factors, which he lists\n\nin the affidavit.

The reasonableness and\n\nnecessity of attorneys’ fees, as we discussed earlier, requires expert testimony. See, e.g., Twin\n\nCity Fire Ins., 223 S.W.3d at 770–71. Yet Mark Johns, who is not an attorney, could not testify\n\nregarding the reasonableness and necessity of attorneys’ fees, and appellants withdrew their\n\ndesignations of their two expert witnesses “as to testimony regarding the attorneys’ fees in this\n\ncase.” 10 Because appellants failed to raise an issue of fact regarding appellee’s section 38.001\n\nattorneys’ fees, the trial court did not err by awarding the attorneys’ fees sought by appellee.\n\n           But all fee claimants must segregate attorneys’ fees between claims for which they are\n\nrecoverable and claims for which they are not.

The trial court, moreover,\n\nheld Mark Johns jointly and severally liable with Sunetics, Inc. for the $53,207.17 in attorneys’\n\n           10\n              Appellants originally designated their lead attorney, Evan Lane (Van) Shaw, to testify regarding issues of attorneys’ fees in this\ncase. Appellants subsequently designated their other attorney, Janet Randle, to also testify regarding attorneys’ fees. On March 5, 2011, in a\nsupplemental response to appellee’s requests for disclosure, appellants answered “[n]one at this time” regarding their testifying experts. In a\nsubsequent March 29 “De-designation of Expert Witnesses,” appellants stated that they “hereby de-designate Van Shaw and Janet Randle as\nexpert witnesses in this case.” Appellants then proffered the affidavit of Janet Randle and attached materials as testimony in support of their\nresponse to appellee’s amended motion for partial summary judgment (filed May 11, 2011). At the same time, they filed a “First Supplement to\nDefendants’ De-designation of Expert Witnesses” that sought to amend their prior de-designation of expert witnesses as follows: “Defendants\nhereby de-designate Van Shaw and Janet Randle as expert witnesses in this case only as to testimony regarding the attorneys’ fees in this case.”\nAppellee moved to strike appellants’ supplement along with its objections to Janet Randle’s affidavit. In its order granting partial summary\njudgment, the trial court overruled appellee’s objections to the Randle affidavit and denied the motion to strike.\n\n\n                                                                    –37–\n\ffees and costs, and appellee’s summary judgment proof does not segregate those fees as to the\n\ntwo defendants.
