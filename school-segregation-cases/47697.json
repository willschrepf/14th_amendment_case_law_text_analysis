W OODALL\nand N ORMA M CG EE O GLE, JJ., joined.\n\nChelsea Nicholson, Nashville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Rokisha Alderson.\n\nRobert E. Cooper, Jr., Attorney General and Reporter; Benjamin A. Ball, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; Victor S. (Torry) Johnson, III, District Attorney General; and Jeff Preston Burks,\nAssistant District Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                        OPINION\n\n       On March 15, 2007, a Davidson County grand jury charged the then-sixteen-year-old\nPetitioner with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of felony murder, two counts\nof attempted especially aggravated robbery, one count of attempted first degree murder, and\none count of aggravated assault. On January 24, 2008, pursuant to a plea agreement, the\nPetitioner pleaded guilty to two counts of felony murder and one count of attempted first\ndegree murder and received a sentence of life plus fifteen years. The Petitioner turned\neighteen years old on November 23, 2008, and delivered her petition to prison officials\nwithin one year of her eighteenth birthday.\n\f        The petition for post-conviction relief alleged that (1) her guilty plea was involuntarily\nentered, (2) her conviction was based on the use of a coerced confession, (3) her conviction\nwas based on the use of evidence gained pursuant to an unconstitutional search and seizure,\n(4) her conviction was based on the use of evidence obtained pursuant to an unlawful arrest,\n(5) her conviction was based on a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination, and\n(6) she was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The Petitioner contended that the\nstatute of limitations should not bar her claims because she was a minor when she entered\nher plea, because she was given inaccurate information by correction officers that she could\nnot file a petition for post-conviction relief until she turned eighteen, and because her low\nreading level made it difficult to complete the petition. Although the petition was stamped\nfiled on January 11, 2010, the petition was signed by the Petitioner and delivered to prison\nofficials on November 22, 2009.\n\n       On January 27, 2010, the trial court dismissed the petition as time-barred, and the\nPetitioner appealed to this court. This court concluded that the trial court erred in dismissing\nthe petition without conducting a hearing to make determinations similar to those outlined\nin Williams v. State, 44 S.W.3d 464 (Tenn. 2001), reversed the trial court’s judgment, and\nremanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on the timeliness of the petition. Rokisha\nLashia Alderson v. State, No. M2010-00896-CCA-R3-PC (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 30, 2010).\nThe Petitioner filed a motion to reopen her post-conviction petition on November 8, 2011,\nand was appointed counsel on December 13, 2011. On March 2, 2012, the trial court held\nan evidentiary hearing to determine if the statute of limitations had been tolled.\n\n       At the hearing, the Petitioner testified that she pleaded guilty on November 1, 2007.\nShe said she was serving a fifty-six-year sentence at 100% for two counts of felony murder\nand one count of attempted first degree murder. She said that at the time of the evidentiary\nhearing, she was twenty-one years old and had been at the Tennessee Prison for Women\nsince she pleaded guilty. She said that within one year of her pleading guilty, she asked a\ncorrection officer about her legal rights. She said the officer told her that she could not file\na post-conviction petition because she could not associate with the adult offenders who\nwould have to assist with filing the legal paperwork. She said she asked him if that meant\nshe could not file a post-conviction petition. She said she did not remember the guard’s\nname because the guards changed daily.\n\n        The Petitioner testified that she was transferred to adult population when she turned\neighteen. She said that she asked a legal assistant at the prison about filing her post-\nconviction petition within the year and that the legal assistant began gathering the paperwork\nfor the petition. She said she filed her petition on November 22, 2009, one day before her\nnineteenth birthday. She said that she did not know why the petition was not filed in the\nclerk’s office until January 11, 2010, but that she gave the petition to the prison officials\n\n                                               -2-\n\fwithin one year of her eighteenth birthday. She said that she went to school through the tenth\ngrade and that she underwent educational testing when she was eighteen but did not know\nthe results. She said she could read and write but did not know her reading or comprehension\nlevel.\n\n        On cross-examination, the Petitioner testified that she “backed out” of a plea\nagreement on November 1, 2007, and pleaded guilty on January 24, 2008. She agreed that\none year from the day she pleaded guilty was January 24, 2009, and that her eighteenth\nbirthday was November 23, 2008, leaving her time after her eighteenth birthday to file the\npetition within one year of the entry of the judgment. She said that she was told to wait until\nshe was eighteen to begin post-conviction proceedings because she needed help from the\nadult inmates with whom she could not associate until she was eighteen. She said she\nentered the general population at the prison the day after her eighteenth birthday. She said\nthat it was “in the policy” that she could not “mingle” with the adults and that because of the\npolicy, she did not have access to a computer or any resources to help her file her paperwork\nin the required time. On redirect examination, a copy of the policy was entered as an exhibit.\nThe Petitioner agreed that policy part 506.14.2 stated “youthful offenders” were to be\nretained in single cells under protective custody and not to have physical contact with\nsentenced offenders.\n\n        Upon questioning by the trial court, the Petitioner said that Erica East was an inmate\n“law clerk.” She said that Ms. East helped with her petition and wrote a letter to the court.\nThe letter from Ms. East stated that when the Petitioner was a juvenile, the law clerks were\nnot permitted to visit her because she was secluded from the general population. The letter\nstated, though, that the law clerk inmates could correspond with juveniles through the in-\nhouse mail system and could request from the captain or shift commander an in-person\nmeeting in a non-contact visitation room if needed.\n\n        The trial court found that the Petitioner failed to provide sufficient proof to\nsubstantiate her claims. It found that the Petitioner’s “unsubstantiated allegation” that a\ncorrection officer provided erroneous information about her filing a post-conviction petition\nbefore her eighteenth birthday was “questionable at best,” that the only proof offered was the\nPetitioner’s allegation, and that no attempts were made to locate the correction officer. The\ncourt found that contrary to the Petitioner’s testimony, she could have contacted inmate law\nclerks as a juvenile to discuss her petition but failed to do so. The court also found that she\ndid not file the petition during the three months after she turned eighteen and before the\nstatute of limitations expired and that she gave no explanation for the delay. The court\nconcluded that the Petitioner failed to show due process required tolling the statute of\nlimitations and failed to prove she was denied a reasonable opportunity to present her\npetition.\n\n                                              -3-\n\f        The Petitioner contends that the trial court erred by finding that the petition for post-\nconviction relief was barred by the statute of limitations and argues that due process requires\ntolling the statute of limitations. She argues that prison officials and a legal aid inmate gave\nher misinformation, preventing her from timely filing her petition. The State responds that\nthe court properly concluded due process did not require tolling the limitations period. The\nState argues that the Petitioner failed to prove prison authorities misled her to believe her age\nprevented her from filing a post-conviction petition or tolled the statute of limitations period.\n\n        This court reviews a post-conviction court’s “conclusions of law, decisions involving\nmixed questions of law and fact, and its application of law to its factual findings de novo\nwithout a presumption of correctness.” Whitehead v. State, 402 S.W.3d 615, 621 (Tenn.\n2013) (citing Felts v. State, 354 S.W.3d 266, 276 (Tenn. 2011); Calvert v. State, 342 S.W.3d\n477, 485 (Tenn. 2011)). “Issues regarding whether due process required the tolling of the\npost-conviction statute of limitations are mixed questions of law and fact and are, therefore,\nsubject to de novo review.” Id. (citing Smith v. State, 357 S.W.3d 322, 355 (Tenn. 2011)).\nThe post-conviction court’s conclusion that due process did not require tolling the statute of\nlimitations under these circumstances is a question of law. The petitioner bears the burden\nof proving by clear and convincing evidence that the statute of limitations should be tolled\nfor due process. See Reid v. State, 197 S.W.3d 694, 705 (stating that “[i]f the clear and\nconvincing standard is adequate to ensure due process in the tolling context, then we deem\nit proper for purposes of the post-conviction proceeding itself”) (citing State v. Nix, 40\nS.W.3d 459, 463-64 (Tenn. 2001)).\n\n       A petition for post-conviction relief must be filed within one year of the final action\nby the highest state appellate court to which an appeal is made or, if no appeal is taken,\nwithin one year of the trial court’s judgment becoming final. T.C.A. § 40-30-102(a) (2012).\n“As a general rule, a trial court’s judgment becomes final thirty days after its entry unless a\ntimely notice of appeal or a specified post-trial motion is filed.” State v. Pendergrass, 937\nS.W.2d 834, 837 (Tenn. 1996). The Petitioner pleaded guilty January 24, 2008, and the\njudgments became final February 23, 2008. The time in which the Petitioner had to file her\npetition expired on February 23, 2009. We conclude that the petition for relief was untimely.\n\n        Tennessee Code Annotated provides for tolling the post-conviction statute of\nlimitations in three instances not applicable to this appeal. See T.C.A. § 40-30-102(b)(1)-(3).\nIn addition, principles of due process may allow for tolling the statute of limitations in\nlimited circumstances. See Burford v. State, 845 S.W.2d 204, 208 (Tenn. 1992) (“[D]ue\nprocess requires that potential litigants be provided an opportunity for the presentation of\nclaims at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”). In Williams, the supreme court\nwas concerned that “a strict application of the statute” could have the effect of denying the\npetitioner “‘a reasonable opportunity to assert a claim in a meaningful time and manner’”\n\n                                               -4-\n\fbecause the petitioner “might have been denied the opportunity to challenge his conviction\nin a timely manner through no fault of his own but because of the possible misrepresentation\nof his counsel.” Williams, 44 S.W.3d at 468 (quoting Seals v. State, 23 S.W.3d 272,279\n(Tenn. 2000)).\n\n       In remanding this case for an evidentiary hearing, this court concluded that while\nWilliams addressed possible attorney misrepresentation, the same rationale applied to\npossible misrepresentation by prison officials and remanded the case for the trial court to\nmake determinations similar to those in Williams. Rokisha Lashia Alderson, slip op. at 4-5.\nThe court was to determine:\n\n       (1) whether due process tolled the statute of limitations so as to give the\n       [Petitioner] a reasonable opportunity after the expiration of the limitations\n       period to present [her] claim in a meaningful time and manner; and (2) if so,\n       whether the [Petitioner’s] filing of the post-conviction petition [on November\n       22, 2009] was within the reasonable opportunity afforded by the due process\n       tolling.\n\nRokisha Lashia Alderson, slip op. at 5 (quoting Williams, 44 S.W.3d at 471). The trial court\nfound that the Petitioner failed to prove due process required tolling the limitations period\nand did not reach the second question.\n\n        Due process tolls the post-conviction statute of limitations for petitioners who face\ncircumstances beyond their control, such as mental illness and attorney misrepresentations,\nthat preclude them from actively raising their post-conviction claims. Williams, 44 S.W.3d\nat 469; Seals, 23 S.W.3d 272. Regarding the Petitioner, this court also concluded that prison\nofficials’ conduct or misrepresentations that precluded petitioners from actively raising their\npost-conviction claims would toll the statute. Rokisha Lashia Alderson, slip op. at 4.\nRecently, our supreme court has said, “A petitioner is entitled to due process tolling upon a\nshowing (1) that he or she has been pursuing his or her rights diligently, and (2) that some\nextraordinary circumstance stood in his or her way and prevented timely filing. Whitehead,\n402 S.W.3d at 613 (citing Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, ---, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 2562\n(2010)).\n\n        We note, first, that the Petitioner’s being a minor at the time she pleaded guilty is not\nsufficient to make a showing of incompetence to toll the statute of limitations. See Stewart\nv. State, 95 S.W.3d 229, 233 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2002); Rokisha Lashia Alderson, slip op. at\n4. Juveniles who have been transferred to adult courts may toll the limitations period but\nmust make a prima facie showing of incompetence to do so, which requires “specific factual\nallegations that demonstrate the Appellant’s inability to manage his personal affairs or\n\n                                               -5-\n\funderstand his legal rights and abilities.” Stewart, 95 S.W.3d at 233; see Nix, 40 S.W.3d at\n464 (stating that a post-conviction petitioner must make a prima facie showing of\nincompetence in order to avoid summary dismissal of the petition). We note, too, that the\npetition alleged that the Petitioner “has a low educational level,” read on a second grade\nlevel, and was unable to understand how to file a post-conviction petition until she found\nanother inmate to help her complete the paperwork. The Petitioner testified, however, that\nshe went to school through the tenth grade and that she could read and write. She failed to\nestablish incompetency to file her petition within the limitations period.\n\n        Regarding the Petitioner’s claim that the statute of limitations should be tolled because\nprison officials deprived her of a meaningful opportunity to present her claim in a timely\nmanner, the Petitioner testified that she inquired about filing a post-conviction petition but\na guard told her she could not file a petition because she “couldn’t mingle with the adult\noffenders . . . and . . . would have to go through them to file [a petition].” She could not\nidentify the guard whom she claimed made the statement. The court discredited her\ntestimony about the conversation with the guard. Based upon a letter from an inmate who\nhelped the Petitioner with her petition, the court found that the Petitioner could have written\nletters to the legal aid inmates or requested non-contact meetings with them. The Petitioner\ndid not offer any evidence that she was prevented from written communications with inmate\nlaw clerks while she was in juvenile segregation. The Petitioner testified that when she was\nmoved to the general population after her eighteenth birthday, she asked an inmate “law\nclerk” about filing her post-conviction petition within the one-year period and that the inmate\nsaid she would gather the paperwork for the petition. Although she testified that she had to\n“go through” the inmate law clerks to file a petition, she did not testify that she was\nprohibited from having access to them in the three-month period between her eighteenth\nbirthday and the expiration of the statute of limitations, nor did she testify that anyone\nprohibited her from filing her petition in the three-month period.\n\n       Regarding the Petitioner’s argument that the trial court should not have determined\nthree months was “enough time” to file her petition, we note that in Williams, the supreme\ncourt declined to determine what length of time was sufficient to pursue post-conviction\nappellate review for a petitioner who had tolled the statute and concluded that it was a\nquestion of fact for the trial court. In the present case, the trial court determined that three\nmonths remained in the limitations period after the Petitioner was released into the general\npopulation but that she waited until the day before her nineteenth birthday to file her petition.\nThe court concluded that the Petitioner was not denied a reasonable opportunity to present\nher claim. The Petitioner’s testimony established that she was aware of the right to seek\npost-conviction relief during the time she was in juvenile segregation. She has not explained\nhow three months was an insufficient time period to prepare her petition with the assistance\nof an inmate law clerk once she reached the general population.\n\n                                               -6-\n\f       The evidence fails to show that the Petitioner diligently pursued her statutory right to\nseek post-conviction relief and that an extraordinary circumstance prevented her from filing\na timely petition. See Whitehead, 402 S.W.3d at 631. The trial court did not err in denying\npost-conviction relief.\n\n        In consideration of the foregoing and the record as a whole, the judgment of the trial\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           ____________________________________\n                                           JOSEPH M.

She said she could read and write but did not know her reading or comprehension\nlevel.\n\n        On cross-examination, the Petitioner testified that she “backed out” of a plea\nagreement on November 1, 2007, and pleaded guilty on January 24, 2008. She agreed that\none year from the day she pleaded guilty was January 24, 2009, and that her eighteenth\nbirthday was November 23, 2008, leaving her time after her eighteenth birthday to file the\npetition within one year of the entry of the judgment. She said that she was told to wait until\nshe was eighteen to begin post-conviction proceedings because she needed help from the\nadult inmates with whom she could not associate until she was eighteen. She said she\nentered the general population at the prison the day after her eighteenth birthday. She said\nthat it was “in the policy” that she could not “mingle” with the adults and that because of the\npolicy, she did not have access to a computer or any resources to help her file her paperwork\nin the required time. On redirect examination, a copy of the policy was entered as an exhibit.\nThe Petitioner agreed that policy part 506.14.2 stated “youthful offenders” were to be\nretained in single cells under protective custody and not to have physical contact with\nsentenced offenders.\n\n        Upon questioning by the trial court, the Petitioner said that Erica East was an inmate\n“law clerk.” She said that Ms. East helped with her petition and wrote a letter to the court.\nThe letter from Ms. East stated that when the Petitioner was a juvenile, the law clerks were\nnot permitted to visit her because she was secluded from the general population. The letter\nstated, though, that the law clerk inmates could correspond with juveniles through the in-\nhouse mail system and could request from the captain or shift commander an in-person\nmeeting in a non-contact visitation room if needed.\n\n        The trial court found that the Petitioner failed to provide sufficient proof to\nsubstantiate her claims. It found that the Petitioner’s “unsubstantiated allegation” that a\ncorrection officer provided erroneous information about her filing a post-conviction petition\nbefore her eighteenth birthday was “questionable at best,” that the only proof offered was the\nPetitioner’s allegation, and that no attempts were made to locate the correction officer. The\ncourt found that contrary to the Petitioner’s testimony, she could have contacted inmate law\nclerks as a juvenile to discuss her petition but failed to do so. The court also found that she\ndid not file the petition during the three months after she turned eighteen and before the\nstatute of limitations expired and that she gave no explanation for the delay. The court\nconcluded that the Petitioner failed to show due process required tolling the statute of\nlimitations and failed to prove she was denied a reasonable opportunity to present her\npetition.\n\n                                              -3-\n\f        The Petitioner contends that the trial court erred by finding that the petition for post-\nconviction relief was barred by the statute of limitations and argues that due process requires\ntolling the statute of limitations. She argues that prison officials and a legal aid inmate gave\nher misinformation, preventing her from timely filing her petition. The State responds that\nthe court properly concluded due process did not require tolling the limitations period. The\nState argues that the Petitioner failed to prove prison authorities misled her to believe her age\nprevented her from filing a post-conviction petition or tolled the statute of limitations period.\n\n        This court reviews a post-conviction court’s “conclusions of law, decisions involving\nmixed questions of law and fact, and its application of law to its factual findings de novo\nwithout a presumption of correctness.” Whitehead v.

The petitioner bears the burden\nof proving by clear and convincing evidence that the statute of limitations should be tolled\nfor due process. See Reid v.

T.C.A. § 40-30-102(a) (2012).\n“As a general rule, a trial court’s judgment becomes final thirty days after its entry unless a\ntimely notice of appeal or a specified post-trial motion is filed.” State v.

We conclude that the petition for relief was untimely.\n\n        Tennessee Code Annotated provides for tolling the post-conviction statute of\nlimitations in three instances not applicable to this appeal. See T.C.A. § 40-30-102(b)(1)-(3).\nIn addition, principles of due process may allow for tolling the statute of limitations in\nlimited circumstances. See Burford v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429816\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429816/burford-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208 (Tenn. 1992) (“[D]ue\nprocess requires that potential litigants be provided an opportunity for the presentation of\nclaims at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”). In Williams, the supreme court\nwas concerned that “a strict application of the statute” could have the effect of denying the\npetitioner “‘a reasonable opportunity to assert a claim in a meaningful time and manner’”\n\n                                               -4-\n\fbecause the petitioner “might have been denied the opportunity to challenge his conviction\nin a timely manner through no fault of his own but because of the possible misrepresentation\nof his counsel.” Williams, 44 S.W.3d at 468 (quoting Seals v.

Rokisha Lashia Alderson, slip op. at 4-5.\nThe court was to determine:\n\n       (1) whether due process tolled the statute of limitations so as to give the\n       [Petitioner] a reasonable opportunity after the expiration of the limitations\n       period to present [her] claim in a meaningful time and manner; and (2) if so,\n       whether the [Petitioner’s] filing of the post-conviction petition [on November\n       22, 2009] was within the reasonable opportunity afforded by the due process\n       tolling.\n\nRokisha Lashia Alderson, slip op. at 5 (quoting Williams, 44 S.W.3d at 471). The trial court\nfound that the Petitioner failed to prove due process required tolling the limitations period\nand did not reach the second question.\n\n        Due process tolls the post-conviction statute of limitations for petitioners who face\ncircumstances beyond their control, such as mental illness and attorney misrepresentations,\nthat preclude them from actively raising their post-conviction claims. Williams, 44 S.W.3d\nat 469; Seals, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Regarding the Petitioner, this court also concluded that prison\nofficials’ conduct or misrepresentations that precluded petitioners from actively raising their\npost-conviction claims would toll the statute. Rokisha Lashia Alderson, slip op. at 4.\nRecently, our supreme court has said, “A petitioner is entitled to due process tolling upon a\nshowing (1) that he or she has been pursuing his or her rights diligently, and (2) that some\nextraordinary circumstance stood in his or her way and prevented timely filing. Whitehead,\n402 S.W.3d at 613 (citing Holland v. Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148483\"><a href=\"/opinion/148483/holland-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ---, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148483\"><a href=\"/opinion/148483/holland-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2562\n(2010)).\n\n        We note, first, that the Petitioner’s being a minor at the time she pleaded guilty is not\nsufficient to make a showing of incompetence to toll the statute of limitations. See Stewart\nv. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2002); Rokisha Lashia Alderson, slip op. at\n4. Juveniles who have been transferred to adult courts may toll the limitations period but\nmust make a prima facie showing of incompetence to do so, which requires “specific factual\nallegations that demonstrate the Appellant’s inability to manage his personal affairs or\n\n                                               -5-\n\funderstand his legal rights and abilities.” Stewart, 95 S.W.3d at 233; see Nix, 40 S.W.3d at\n464 (stating that a post-conviction petitioner must make a prima facie showing of\nincompetence in order to avoid summary dismissal of the petition). We note, too, that the\npetition alleged that the Petitioner “has a low educational level,” read on a second grade\nlevel, and was unable to understand how to file a post-conviction petition until she found\nanother inmate to help her complete the paperwork. The Petitioner testified, however, that\nshe went to school through the tenth grade and that she could read and write. She failed to\nestablish incompetency to file her petition within the limitations period.\n\n        Regarding the Petitioner’s claim that the statute of limitations should be tolled because\nprison officials deprived her of a meaningful opportunity to present her claim in a timely\nmanner, the Petitioner testified that she inquired about filing a post-conviction petition but\na guard told her she could not file a petition because she “couldn’t mingle with the adult\noffenders . . . and . . . would have to go through them to file [a petition].” She could not\nidentify the guard whom she claimed made the statement. The court discredited her\ntestimony about the conversation with the guard. Based upon a letter from an inmate who\nhelped the Petitioner with her petition, the court found that the Petitioner could have written\nletters to the legal aid inmates or requested non-contact meetings with them. The Petitioner\ndid not offer any evidence that she was prevented from written communications with inmate\nlaw clerks while she was in juvenile segregation. The Petitioner testified that when she was\nmoved to the general population after her eighteenth birthday, she asked an inmate “law\nclerk” about filing her post-conviction petition within the one-year period and that the inmate\nsaid she would gather the paperwork for the petition. Although she testified that she had to\n“go through” the inmate law clerks to file a petition, she did not testify that she was\nprohibited from having access to them in the three-month period between her eighteenth\nbirthday and the expiration of the statute of limitations, nor did she testify that anyone\nprohibited her from filing her petition in the three-month period.\n\n       Regarding the Petitioner’s argument that the trial court should not have determined\nthree months was “enough time” to file her petition, we note that in Williams, the supreme\ncourt declined to determine what length of time was sufficient to pursue post-conviction\nappellate review for a petitioner who had tolled the statute and concluded that it was a\nquestion of fact for the trial court. In the present case, the trial court determined that three\nmonths remained in the limitations period after the Petitioner was released into the general\npopulation but that she waited until the day before her nineteenth birthday to file her petition.\nThe court concluded that the Petitioner was not denied a reasonable opportunity to present\nher claim. The Petitioner’s testimony established that she was aware of the right to seek\npost-conviction relief during the time she was in juvenile segregation. She has not explained\nhow three months was an insufficient time period to prepare her petition with the assistance\nof an inmate law clerk once she reached the general population.\n\n                                               -6-\n\f       The evidence fails to show that the Petitioner diligently pursued her statutory right to\nseek post-conviction relief and that an extraordinary circumstance prevented her from filing\na timely petition. See Whitehead, 402 S.W.3d at 631. The trial court did not err in denying\npost-conviction relief.\n\n        In consideration of the foregoing and the record as a whole, the judgment of the trial\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           ____________________________________\n                                           JOSEPH M.
