After trial to\nthe bench, the court ruled that the two roads had been dedicated as public streets, and that\nplaintiffs, Jaime A. Scher and Jane McAllister, had an implied easement over the roads\nfor access to their property. Defendants,1 all of whom own land along the two roads\nsouth of plaintiffs’ property, appeal from the portion of the judgment burdening their land\nand enjoining them from obstructing vehicular access. The court also found that\nplaintiffs had not established their right to an express, prescriptive, or equitable easement\nfor access along the roads and across defendants’ properties. Plaintiffs appeal from this\npart of the judgment in favor of defendants.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that Civil Code section 1009 bars\nall use of non-coastal private real property, not simply recreational use of such property,\nfrom ever ripening into an implied dedication to the public after the effective date of that\nstatute. Hence, the trial court erred in considering evidence about use of the subject roads\nafter March 4, 1972 to support its finding that the roads were impliedly dedicated to\npublic use.\n       In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we hold that the trial court misapplied\nthe law when it ruled that plaintiffs have an implied easement that arose before 1902,\nwhile the land was still owned by the federal government. We also conclude that the\ncourt erred in ruling that the two roads were dedicated to public use during that time.\nThere is no evidence of the roads’ use before 1972 such as would support a finding that\n\n1\n      Defendants are Gemma Marshall, Richard Erickson and Wendie Malick,\nRichard B. and Andrea D. Schroder, Christina Erteszak, Northern Trust Bank, N.A.,\nBennett Kerns, Trustee of the A.S.A. Trust, dated June 28, 2005 “on behalf of\nJohn Burke & Germaine Burke,” John F. and Germaine Burke.\n\n                                               2\n\fthey were impliedly dedicated as public streets. With respect to plaintiffs’ appeal, we\nconclude that the trial court did not err in ruling that plaintiffs failed to prove they had an\nexpress easement or an easement by prescription, or were entitled to an equitable\neasement.\n       Accordingly, the portion of the judgment against defendants is reversed and the\nportion of the judgment against plaintiffs is affirmed.\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       For simplicity, we will not identify the parties’ predecessors in title. (Cf. Jones v.\nTierney-Sinclair (1945) 71 Cal.App.2d 366, 368 [declining to distinguish acts done by\nthe parties from those committed by predecessors in interest].)\n       1. The land in the area at issue\n       In the late 1700s, the federal government began surveying the western\nUnited States pursuant to the Public Land Survey System.2 The government divided the\nland into “townships,” and split each township into 36 square-mile “sections.” At issue\nhere are Sections 1, 7, and 12, in a township located in the Santa Monica Mountains.\n       The two roads at issue are Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road.3 Henry\nRidge Motorway runs approximately north/south along Henry Ridge, above Topanga\nCanyon, from Alta Drive in Section 1 in the north to near its southern end where it\nconnects with Gold Stone Road in Section 12. The junction between Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road is a hairpin turn where Henry Ridge Motorway\nmeasures about 12 feet wide. Gold Stone Road runs from Henry Ridge Motorway\neasterly into Section 7 where it terminates at Greenleaf Canyon Road, a public street.\n\n\n\n2\n        We grant defendants’ motion filed on July 6, 2012, to take judicial notice of an\narticle from the United States Department of the Interior’s website concerning the Public\nLand Survey System, <http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/a_plss.html>.\n3\n      Gold Stone Road is identified in the record variously as “Goldstone” Road and\n“Gold Stone” Road. For consistency, and following the parties’ lead, we will use the\ntwo-word name.\n\n                                               3\n\fGreenleaf Canyon Road ends in the south at Topanga Canyon Boulevard, which\neventually leads further south to the town center of Topanga.\n       From the north, Henry Ridge Motorway may be reached from Mulholland\nBoulevard via Adamsville Avenue and Alta Drive, both public roads, or Oldfield Ranch\nRoad and Summit to Summit Road. From the south, Henry Ridge Motorway was\naccessible from School Road until the early 1990s when the school district installed\ngates. Now, the only outlet from the southerly part of Henry Ridge Motorway is through\nGold Stone Road to Greenleaf Canyon Road.\n       Plaintiffs’ land is the northernmost of the parties’ properties on Henry Ridge\nMotorway in Section 1; all of defendants’ properties lie to the south of plaintiffs’ land.\nFrom Alta Drive south through plaintiffs’ property, Henry Ridge Motorway is paved.\nImmediately south of plaintiffs’ property lie four successive parcels owned by non-\nparties where Oldfield Ranch Road branches off to the east. At some point, the pavement\nceases and Henry Ridge Motorway is indicated on a local map as a “trail.” Defendant\nMarshall owns the next southerly parcel on the unpaved trail, also in Section 1. Abutting\nMarshall to the south, where Section 12 commences, lie two parcels on Henry Ridge\nMotorway owned by defendants Erickson and Malick. (We will refer to these parcels as\nErickson/Malick north and Erickson/Malick south, respectively.) Henry Ridge\nMotorway divides the Erickson/Malick south parcel to the west from the Schroder\ndefendants’ property to the east. Henry Ridge Motorway turns into Gold Stone Road as it\nbends generally eastward through the Schroder property toward Section 7. There, it cuts\nacross land owned by defendant A.S.A. Trust, Kerns Trustee, and crosses onto the Burke\ndefendants’ property. The Burkes’ driveway opens onto Greenleaf Canyon Road.\n       Plaintiffs also own an undeveloped lot off of Old Topanga Canyon Road in\nSection 12 that does not touch on Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone Road.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n       [[2. The evidence of the roads’ existence\n       a. the 1895 survey plat\n       Soon after California became a state, the federal government surveyed the\nTopanga Canyon area. A survey plat dated 1895 is divided into section squares, like\ngraph paper. In Sections 1 and 12, the 1895 survey plat shows a dotted line lying next to\na solid-line “Road,” located generally in the area of Henry Ridge Motorway wending\nroughly along the ridge line, across the land corresponding to property now owned by\nMarshall, Erickson/Malick, and Schroder. Exactly where the “Road” lay in 1895 cannot\nbe established. At the time, the property belonged to the United States Government.\nThe 1895 survey plat also reflects a dotted-line identified as a “Trail” lying to the east of\nthe “Road,” and located in Section 1 generally where Greenleaf Canyon Road lies now.\nPlaintiffs’ title expert Anya Stanley inferred from the survey plat that in 1895, the “Road”\nalong Henry Ridge was more established than the “Trail.”\n       Viewing a composite map that she compiled from the 1895 survey plat, Stanley\nsurmised, although acknowledging it was difficult to decipher, that while still federal\nland, the “Road” extended along what is now Henry Ridge Motorway, through\nMarshall’s, Erickson/Malicks’, and Schroders’ land, and may “possibly, depending upon\nhow accurate this [composite] map is,” have crossed land now owned by the Burkes.\nStanley acknowledged that her compilation map did not actually show this “Road”\nconnecting to Greenleaf Canyon. By contrast, defendants’ expert surveyor John MacNeil\nexplained that the surveyors’ task in 1895 was to set the section corners, not survey\nroads. MacNeil pointed out that the 1895 survey plat upon which Stanley relied was not\nintended to plot the course of a road, but only to show that it existed.\n       Stanley did not know who built the “Road” along the ridge line or whether the\nfederal government improved the “Road” before 1911. Stanley postulated that early\nnative American traders may have used the “Trail.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       b. the United States Government homestead patents\n       The parties in this case trace their titles to grants issued under the federal\nHomestead Act (Act of May 20, 1862, ch. 75, §§ 1-8, 12 Stat. 392; Act of Mar. 3, 1855,\nch. 207, 10 Stat. 701; Act of Apr. 24, 1820, ch. 51, 3 Stat. 566; Murphy v. Burch (2009)\n46 Cal.4th 157, 168, citing Granite Beach Holdings v. State (Wash.App. 2000) 11 P.3d\n847, 854) (the Homestead Act). The Homestead Act required those seeking to own land\nto occupy and cultivate or mine up to 160 acres for at least five years and then file an\napplication to the United States Government for a patent. A patent is the official\ndocument reflecting the federal grant conferring fee simple title to public land.\n(Murphy v. Burch, supra, at p. 162 & fn. 1 (Murphy).)\n       Records from the Federal Bureau of Land Management and the Los Angeles\nCounty Recorder’s Office show that the United States issued a patent for the\nErickson/Malick north property in 1902. The patent covering the Erickson/Malick south\nproperty and the Schroder property was issued in 1903. The patent for plaintiffs’ land is\ndated 1907. The predecessors of Marshall and of the Burkes each obtained their patents\nin 1911. The parties own only portions of the properties originally patented to their\npredecessors. Over the past century and a half, all of the homesteaded land has been\nsubdivided into smaller parcels. The patents in this case specifically reserved to the\nUnited States previously vested and accrued water rights, previously granted mineral\nrights, and rights-of-way for ditches and canals.\n       c. the 1908 map\n       A map of Topanga in 1908, derived by MacNeil from earlier maps, labeled the\n“Road” from the 1895 survey plat as the “Ridge Trail,” while the 1895 “Trail” became\n“Greenleaf Road.” The 1908 map does not clarify the locations of the 1895 “Road” or\nthe 1908 “Ridge Trail.” Stanley testified the route of the “Ridge Trail” has changed since\nthe 19th century. For example, the 1908 “Ridge Trail” is not identical to what is now\nHenry Ridge Motorway because the modern road extends farther north than in 1895, and\nwas reconfigured in the south to follow a straighter path into what is now School Road.\nMacNeil created the 1908 map from the 1895 survey plat, never intending it to constitute\n\n                                               6\n\fa survey of the location of Henry Ridge, and so he testified it was “never established that\nit was [Henry Ridge] Motorway all the way to [Greenleaf Canyon Road].” The 1895\nsurvey plat and the 1908 map do not identify the roads’ actual locations a century ago,\nand there is no other evidence to indicate whether today’s Henry Ridge Motorway exists\nin the same location as “Ridge Trial” did on the 1908 map, or in 1902 when the first\npatent was issued in this case.\n       d. maps from the 1930s\n       No road or trail is identified in that area on the “Early subdivisions and points of\ninterest map of Topanga Canyon in the 1930s.” What was identified as the “Trail” in the\n1895 survey plat and “Greenleaf Road” in 1908, became “Greenleaf Canyon Road” on\nthe 1930s map.\n       “Henry Ridge Motorway” first appears by that name in CSB maps from the 1930s.\nCSB maps are County of Los Angeles surveys that define alignments of proposed as well\nas existing roads. The CSB maps from 1935 and 1937 depict “Henry Ridge Motorway”\nas extending north all the way to Mulholland Drive, which was a “major public street”\nthen. In the 1930s, Cal-Trans considered a “motorway” to be a banked road that either\nwas or would be graded to accommodate motor vehicles, as opposed to a horse-drawn\ncarriages or stage coaches. More recently, the County defined “Motorway” as “[a] truck\ntrail or trail through mountainous terrain, usually for fire equipment usage or service\naccess; e.g., power lines, Nike sites, etc. Not for public use.”4 (Italics added.) In the late\n\n\n\n4\n       We grant defendants’ request to take judicial notice of the Street Name Policy of\nthe County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works as of June 28, 1999, and the\nHouse Numbering and Street Naming Manual of the Los Angeles Department of Public\nWorks, dated April 1999. Plaintiffs oppose the request on the ground this document was\nnot before the trial court. However, the naming of a street is a legislative act (Gov. Code,\n§ 34091.1) and the question of what “Motorway” means is a question of law, which we\nindependently decide, regardless of whether the issue was before the trial court. (Burden\nv. Snowden (1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [“As the matter is a question of law, we are not\nbound by evidence on the question presented below or by the lower court’s\ninterpretation.”].)\n\n                                              7\n\f1930s, the County Fire Department built and graded Henry Ridge Motorway from\nAdamsville Road to School Road in case of brush fire.\n       e. the 1949 Easement – Sections 7 & 12\n       In 1949, a predecessor-in-interest of the Burkes granted to the prior owner of the\nSchroder and Erickson/Malick south properties an “appurtenant” easement “for roadway\npurposes” for “ingress to and egress from the said Greenleaf Canyon Road to the property\nof” the Schroder and Erickson/Malick south parcels in Sections 7 and 12 respectively.\n(The 1949 Easement) The 1949 Easement over Burke’s property ran generally where\nGold Stone Road today crosses the Burke land, and was “just a drive, private driveway”\nthen. The grant further provided that “in the event” the state or county “accept[ed] the\nroadway as a public road,” then the grantor and her successors in interest “consent[ed] to\nthe dedication of the said road.” (Italics added.) The record contains no acceptance by a\npublic entity. The 1949 Easement burdens Burkes’ property and benefits the\nErickson/Malick south and Schroder properties, but does not benefit plaintiffs’ Section 12\nproperty.\n       f. the 1950 maps\n       Witnesses testified that Henry Ridge Motorway’s route has changed over the\nyears. There have been minor changes in the road’s alignment. It was straightened out\nand paved in part. The road previously went over the top of a ridge on plaintiffs’\nproperty. Henry Ridge Motorway was moved to the west as much as 150 feet to a\nlocation down along the side of a hill. Also, the road once came within 40 feet of\nplaintiffs’ house. MacNeil did a comparison of Henry Ridge Motorway in 1952 to the\n1895 survey plat and found that in some places the road had moved four to five hundred\nfeet. The first time “Goldstone Road” was shown on a map, was in a 1952 CSB map.\n       g. the 1960s maps and the Thomas Brothers’ Guide Maps\n       Henry Ridge Motorway was still not much of a road in the 1960s despite its\ndepiction on the 1930s CSB maps. Two government maps from 1967 reflect\n“Henry Ridge” as a nameless, “unimproved dirt” road. Although the phrase\n“HENRY RIDGE” appears in all capital letters on the 1967 maps, all of the roads in the\n\n                                             8\n\farea, including large roads such as Topanga Canyon Boulevard, are identified in lower\ncase letters. One of the 1967 maps indicates an unimproved dirt road in the general\nvicinity of what is now Gold Stone Road.\n       Thomas Brothers’ Guide maps from 1960 and 1966 show a road identified as\n“Henry Ridge Road” and “Henry Ridge Motorway.” Neither shows Gold Stone Road or\na road where Gold Stone Road lies today. The Thomas Brothers’ Guide maps in 1983\nlist Gold Stone Road as a private dirt road. Gold Stone Road was first paved around\n1987. The Thomas Brothers maps in 1996 and 2001 show “Henry Ridge Mtwy” and\n“Gold Stone Road.” Stanley acknowledged that Thomas Brothers Guides sometimes\ncontained errors and showed roads that do not actually exist.\n       h. the 1968 Declaration of Easement – Section 12\n       In 1968, the owner of the property comprised of the Schroder and\nErickson/Malick’s southern parcels in Section 12, decided to subdivide the land into four\nparcels, A through D. To provide the new parcels with access to a public street, i.e.,\nGreenleaf Canyon Road, the grantor recorded a “Declaration and Grant of Easements”\nfor “road purposes and to be appurtenant to all land in said Sec. 12” as depicted on an\nattached map (1968 Declaration).\n       The 1968 Declaration specifies that its easement offer would “tak[e] effect upon”\nthe recording by any Section 12 fee owner of an “acceptance.” Additionally, the 1968\ndeclaration mimics the language of the 1949 Easement as it was also made “with the\nunderstanding that in the event a final tract map or parcel map [were recorded] over any\nportion of this division dedicating . . . to public use streets . . . which are accepted by the\nCounty,” the easement “shall no longer be of any force or effect.” (Italics added.)\nNeither an acceptance of the easement by the fee owner, nor a final tract or parcel map\nwas ever recorded. The easement’s route as depicted on the map attached to the 1968\nDeclaration differs considerably from the route of Gold Stone Road today. Also, as there\nis no evidence of any consent to change the easement’s route to conform to the current\nroad, there are portions of southerly Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road over\nwhich the 1968 Declaration does not appear to grant an easement.\n\n                                               9\n\f       i. the 1970 Easement Declarations – Sections 1 & 12\n       On July 16, 1970, the owner of land now held by Marshall, the previous owner of\nErickson/Malick’s northern parcel, and the predecessor of McCoy who is not a party to\nthis lawsuit, executed identical instruments, all signed by the same person and recorded\non the same day, entitled “Declaration and Grant of Easements” (the 1970 Declarations).\nUsing almost the same language as the 1968 Declaration, the three 1970 Declarations\nwere designed to facilitate a proposed division of the relevant land in Sections 1 and 12\ninto smaller parcels. Accordingly, the 1970 Declarations created strips of land shown on\nattached maps to be “easements for road purposes and to be appurtenant to all land” in\nthe respective sections, namely Section 1 for the Marshall property, and Section 12 for\nthe Erickson/Malick north property, “the vesting of title to said easements to take effect\nupon recording . . . by any fee owner of a portion of said Sec. . . . of an acceptance of\nsaid easements.” (Italics added.) The record contains no acceptance. There is\nconflicting evidence about the route of the easements and dedicated road created by the\n1970 Declarations.\n       The 1970 Declarations also state: “OWNER makes this declaration with the\nunderstanding that in the event a final tract map or parcel map is caused to be filed with\nthe County Recorder over any portion of this division, dedicating or deeding to public use\nstreets and highways for said map which are accepted by the County of Los Angeles, this\ndeclaration insofar as said lands are affected by said final tract map or parcel map, shall\nno longer be of any force or effect.” (Italics added.) The legends on two of the maps\nattached to the three 1970 Declarations indicate a solid line representing “Dedicated\nroads, per attached declaration . . . .” No acceptance of any of the 1970 Declarations was\nrecorded. Neither the Marshall nor the Ericson/Malick north properties was subdivided\naccording to the 1970 Declarations.]]\n                               [[End nonpublished portion]]\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       3. The irrevocable offers to dedicate trail easements\n       a. Marshall’s hiking and equestrian trail dedication on Henry Ridge Motorway\n       To develop her land in Section 1, Marshall was required to obtain a permit from\nthe California Coastal Commission. As a condition to granting the permit, the Coastal\nCommission required Marshal to “record” an instrument “irrevocably offering to\ndedicate . . . an easement for a hiking and equestrian trail for public use” of the\nTopanga-Henry Ridge Trail, which crosses part of Henry Ridge Motorway on her land.\nMarshall’s 1989 irrevocable offer “dedicate[d] to the People of California an easement in\nperpetuity for the purposes of hiking and equestrian trail . . . .” (Italics added.)\n       The attached Coastal Commission Staff Report and Recommendations found and\ndeclared that “The Topanga-Henry Ridge Trail traverses the private access road\n(Henry Ridge Motorway) . . . .” (Italics added.) Continuing, the report states, “these\nprivately maintained roads have become commonly used recreational links between\ngrowing centers of development in the mountains. While currently unimproved, these\nroads . . . functioned as public thru-ways and have historically been open to unobstructed\nvehicular and pedestrian traffic. It is likely that demand for this particular trail will\nincrease as the immediate area is built out.” (Italics added.) “Henry Ridge Motorway is\ncommonly used by equestrians, hikers, and joggers. Formal dedication may not be\nnecessary to continue the use of this trail, because as in the case of other commonly used\ntrails in the mountains, there is strong likelihood that prescriptive rights have been\nestablished.” (Italics added.)\n       b. trail dedication on Henry Ridge Motorway by predecessors of the Schroders\nand Erickson/Malicks\n       In 1992, prior owners of the Schroder and Erickson/Malick south properties in\nSection 12 recorded an “Irrevocable Offer to Dedicate Trail Easement and Declaration of\nRestrictions,” the purpose of which was to “allow[] public pedestrian and equestrian\ningress and egress and for public recreational purposes.” (Italics added.) The Dedication\naffected a 20-foot wide strip of property that was contiguous with, and over the portion of\nTopanga-Henry Ridge Trail that lies within the owner’s parcel, and specifically limited\n\n                                              11\n\fthe “right of public use of the easement” “to daylight hours, from one hour before sunrise\nto one hour after sunset.” The offer did not involve Gold Stone Road.\n       As reflected in the document, this trail dedication was a condition of a Coastal\nCommission development permit. The Dedication states that “the Property is a parcel\ntraversed by a trail used for public recreation and access . . . .” The declaration contained\nthe condition that the grantors would not interfere “with [the] present public use of this\nroad.” (Italics added.) The restriction provides that the offer of dedication shall not be\n“construed to allow anyone, prior to acceptance of the Offer, to interfere with any rights\nof public access acquired through use which may exist on the Property.” (Italics added.)\n       The attached staff report reflects the Coastal Commission’s mounting concern\nabout the effects of increased development in the area on recreational use. The report\nnotes that Henry Ridge Trail provides access and helps to connect areas with the\n“remainder of the trail system.” These trails “have become important and commonly\nused recreational assets and a means of providing access to and links between natural,\nscenic, and recreational areas in the mountains.” However, “[r]esearch has shown that a\nmajor deterrent to public use of recreational trails and similar public recreation areas and\nfacilities is a perception by the public that the areas involved are private.” The report\nobserves that “development tends to preempt public access, partly due to the ‘feeling of\ntrespass’ engendered by the predominance of private development” and notes the\nnecessity of placing conditions on development “to formalize the public’s right to\ncontinued use of these trails.”5 (Italics added.)\n       4. Use of Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road by plaintiffs and others\n       Much of this lawsuit concerns whether and in what manner Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road were used by the public.\n\n\n\n5\n        Plaintiffs introduced into evidence numerous other documents and instruments in\ndefendants’ various chains of title. We will not include these exhibits here because they\nare not cited by the trial court and the evidence does not show that these instruments\naffect the result here.\n\n                                             12\n\f                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n        [[a. Pre-1972\n        Unable to locate eyewitnesses from the 1800s through the early 1900s, plaintiffs\nrelied on inferences from photographs, lot books, the parties’ chains of title, historical-\nsociety documents, and the above-described maps and instruments. The 1908 map\nreflects some development in the Topanga Canyon area, such as houses, a tavern, a post\noffice, inns, campsites, a general store, and a school. A tavern with cabins operated in\n1908 on Chaney’s Road, east of Greenleaf Road. Automobiles were photographed at the\nTopanga General Store in the 1920s. Photographs show the evolution of the area’s\ndevelopment starting with mail delivery in 1880, although plaintiffs’ expert Stanley\nadmitted “it [the photography] doesn’t prove anything.” No development is depicted\nalong the “Ridge Trail” in 1908. Instead, all of the development is accessible from other\nroads, including the “Topanga to Calabasas Road,” now called Old Topanga Canyon\nRoad.\n        Pauline Stewart conveyed her Section 1 property to plaintiffs in 1998.6 She\ntestified that Henry Ridge Motorway was both public and private. She stated that the\nroads at issue “have been used for fifty years” and “there wasn’t any question” that\n“those roads had been public property for so long.” Yet, Stewart admitted she did not\npersonally know of anyone driving Gold Stone Road to Henry Ridge Motorway.]]\n                               [[End nonpublished portion]]\n        b. After March 4, 1972\n        When Pauline Stewart, the “matriarch of Henry Ridge,” moved to Henry Ridge\nMotorway in 1977, it was merely a “fire road.” In 1984, the Los Angeles County Fire\nDepartment notified Stewart that it would no longer maintain the road because the\n“County had designated it as a private road.” (Italics added.) Stewart described Henry\nRidge in a 1988 letter as “a road on private property so it is considered a private road, it\n\n\n6\n       Aged 91 at the time of trial, Stewart was unavailable to testify and so her\ndeposition was read into the record.\n\n                                             13\n\fis not a public thoroughfare, even though it is open to the public for all practical\npurposes.” (Italics added.)\n       Stewart’s own travel on Henry Ridge Motorway was almost exclusively\nnorthbound from plaintiffs’ property and not southerly through defendants’ land. The\nonly roads that were continuously used for access to and from plaintiffs’ property were\nAdamsville and Alta to the north. Stewart used Gold Stone Road twice in 20 years. She\nhad no personal knowledge of anyone using Gold Stone Road to Henry Ridge Motorway;\nshe did not even know whether her husband used Gold Stone Road. Nor did Stewart\nknow whether any property owners on Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone Road\ndedicated those roads to public use. She was unaware of facts that would show that the\ngeneral public had used Henry Ridge Motorway to Gold Stone Road to Greenleaf\nCanyon on a regular basis. She stated, “I don’t know anybody in their right mind that\nwould even try to go that way.” (Italics added.)\n       Plaintiffs called a series of witnesses who described their use of Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road. These witnesses, including plaintiffs, their neighbors,\ndefendants, friends, handymen, tenants, and others in the area, also described who they\nsaw driving along the two roads. None of the witnesses described use of or activity on the\ntwo roads before March 4, 1972.\n       Plaintiffs purchased their Section 1 property in 1998. They have an easement,\nrecorded in 1948, giving them access northerly along “that certain road only, now known\nas a fire road and connected with proposed Mulholland Blvd.” Plaintiffs’ tenants’ leases\nspecify that the tenants may use Henry Ridge Motorway to the north for access but not to\nthe south, except “in case of dire emergency.” Plaintiff Scher testified that since\npurchasing his Section 1 property he intended to establish rights south along Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road.\n       Plaintiffs bought their Section 12 property off of Old Topanga Canyon Road\nin 2007. Undeveloped, plaintiffs’ Section 12 lot measures 1,250 square feet and does not\ntouch Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone Road. Scher testified he bought the\nSection 12 lot “ ‘partially to stick a thorn in my neighbor’s side’ ” and because plaintiffs\n\n                                             14\n\fwanted to claim a right to use the two roads at issue under the Declarations of Easements,\nwhich plaintiffs believed benefitted Section 12 owners, but not plaintiffs’ Section 1\nproperty.\n       Marshall purchased her property in 1987. In 1990, after recording her trail\ndedication and obtaining a Coastal Commission development permit, Marshall began\nconstructing a residence located 24 feet from Henry Ridge Motorway. Marshall posted\nsigns on the northern and southern boundaries of her property declaring “Private Road\npermission to pass subject to control of owner. Penal Code 602 and Section 1008 Civil\nCode.” Marshall hung the signs to prevent people from gaining prescriptive rights on her\nproperty.\n       In 1991, Marshall installed a locked gate across Henry Ridge Motorway on the\nnorthern boundary of her land and later electrified it. Marshall gave gate keys for\nemergencies to the fire department and her neighbors, including Stewart, who passed one\non to plaintiffs when they bought the property. When closed, the gate prevents only\nvehicular access; hikers and equestrians can circumnavigate it.\n       Erickson and Malick, attracted by the quiet and privacy, purchased their north\nparcel in 1996 and their south parcel in 2000. Erickson “religiously” stops drivers on\nGold Stone Road and Henry Ridge Motorway who he does not recognize. Erickson once\nchallenged Scher’s right to use the road on the Erickson/Malick south property. Malick\nhas “often” stopped people on Gold Stone Road because they were following the\nThomas Brothers’ Guide to Henry Ridge Motorway. In 2008, Erickson and Malick\nrecorded two declarations granting consent to use Henry Ridge Motorway on their two\nparcels pursuant to Civil Code section 813.\n       The Schroders have lived on their land since 2005, in part because of the privacy it\nafforded. Their seller and realtor told them there were no ingress and egress easements\non Gold Stone Road. Schroder has been vigilant about keeping drivers off Gold Stone\nRoad. He “always” stops drivers and redirects them unless they are guests of the\nErickson/Malicks. There are two gates across Gold Stone Road.\n\n\n                                              15\n\f       The Burkes bought their Section 7 land in 1993. In 2005, they bought the\nunimproved land now held by the A.S.A. Trust to prevent development and ensure\nprivacy. There is a sign at the intersection of Greenleaf Canyon Road and Gold Stone\nRoad declaring the latter to be “Private.” Another sign reads, “ ‘No access to\nHenry Ridge Road. Locked gates ahead.’ ” On a wooden gate at the junction of\nGold Stone Road, Greenleaf Canyon, and the Burkes’ driveway stands a sign since at\nleast 1993 that forbids trespassing, parking, dumping, and loitering. The Burkes posted\nthe signs pursuant to Civil Code section 1008 so that people would know they were\npermissively driving on Gold Stone Road. Since they moved into their Section 7\nproperty, the Burkes have stopped passersby to re-direct those not entitled to use Gold\nStone Road.\n       5. Alternative routes\n       Plaintiffs calculate that traveling Henry Ridge Motorway south to Gold Stone\nRoad is more convenient because this route to Topanga center takes 7 to 10 minutes.\nThere are numerous roads connecting to Henry Ridge Motorway in the north to Topanga\ncenter, but those routes take plaintiffs 18 to 20 minutes. Plaintiffs claim they are unable\nto use Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road to evacuate to the south in case of\nemergency.\n       In 2005, plaintiffs discovered that the lock on Marshall’s gate was jammed.\nPlaintiffs sent Marshall letters demanding a new key and claiming an express easement to\nuse Henry Ridge Motorway. Plaintiffs also sent letters to Erickson/Malick and discussed\nthe issue of access to the two roads with Schroder. People consulted with their title\ninsurers.\n       6. The litigation\n       Plaintiffs filed their complaint alleging that defendants’ properties are burdened,\nand plaintiffs are benefitted, by express easements for ingress and egress along Henry\nRidge Motorway and Gold Stone Road. The complaint sought to quiet title to the\neasements and sought declarations that: (1) plaintiffs are the beneficial owners of\nexpress, prescriptive, and equitable easements to use Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold\n\n                                             16\n\fStone Road; (2) defendants have acquiesced to the dedication to public use of the entirety\nof Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road across defendants’ properties; and\n(3) plaintiffs are entitled to use Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road as a public\nstreet. The complaint also sought to enjoin defendants from interfering with plaintiffs’\nuse of the two roads. After trial, plaintiffs amended their complaint according to proof to\nadd a cause of action for implied easement.\n                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n       [[The trial court issued a 19-page statement of decision finding: (1) plaintiffs had\nan implied easement for vehicular ingress and egress that arose before the federal\nGovernment conveyed the land by patents in 1902; (2) Henry Ridge Motorway and a\nportion of Gold Stone Road at Greenleaf Canyon Road were dedicated to the public when\nthe land was still owned by the United States Government; (3) the public has vested\nrights to use the roads under the doctrines of implied-in-law and implied-in-fact\ndedication; and (4) plaintiffs failed to prove they had an express, prescriptive, or\nequitable easement.]]\n                               [[End nonpublished portion]]\n       The trial court entered judgment declaring that Henry Ridge Motorway and\nGold Stone Road had been impliedly dedicated as public streets and quieting title to\neasements over the two roads in favor of plaintiffs.

The court also entered judgment\nagainst plaintiffs on their theories of express, prescriptive, and equitable easement.\nDefendants appeal and plaintiffs appeal.\n                                     CONTENTIONS\n       Defendants’ appeals challenge the portions of the judgment against them and\nplaintiffs’ appeal challenges the portion of the judgment against them.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f                                      DISCUSSION\n                                              I\n                                DEFENDANTS’ APPEAL\n                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n                      [[Implied Easement Based On Federal Patents\n       1. The elements of implied easements\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the\nfederal patents created an implied easement over Henry Ridge Motorway because the\ncommon ownership element was lacking.7 The trial court found the evidence “manifest”\nthat Henry Ridge Motorway existed and was used before the first division of title in 1902\nwhen the federal government issued the first patent.\n       The law will imply an intent to create an easement by grant or reservation in the\nabsence of a written document evincing intent. (6 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate\n(3d ed. 2011) § 15:19, p. 15-18.) Easements will be implied if the following conditions\nexist at the time of the conveyance: “1) the owner of property conveys or transfers a\nportion of that property to another; 2) the owner’s prior existing use of the property was\nof a nature that the parties must have intended or believed that the use would continue;\nmeaning that the existing use must either have been known to the grantor and the grantee,\nor have been so obviously and apparently permanent that the parties should have known\nof the use; and 3) the easement is reasonably necessary to the use and benefit of the\nquasi-dominant tenement.” (Tusher v. Gabrielsen (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 131, 141,\n\n\n\n\n7\n        We do not read the judgment as finding an implied easement for access over\nGold Stone Road, plaintiffs’ suggestion to the contrary notwithstanding. To the extent\nthat the statement of decision could be read as having declared an implied easement over\na portion of Gold Stone Road, our holding as it relates to the ruling concerning an\nimplied easement for access on Henry Ridge Motorway likewise applies to Gold Stone\nRoad.\n\n                                             18\n\ffn. omitted (Tusher); see also Civ. Code, § 1104;8 12 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law\n(10th ed. 2005) Real Property § 392, p. 460.)\n       The grantee is said to have a grant of a right of way when an access easement by\nimplication benefits the conveyed parcel. Conversely, the grantor has impliedly reserved\nan access easement across the grantee’s property when the easement by implication is\nretained for the benefit of the grantor’s parcel. (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 163.)\n       “ ‘ “The law does not favor the implication of easements. Such implication can\nonly be made in connection with a conveyance, and in view of the rule that a conveyance\nis to be construed against the grantor . . . . Whether an easement arises by implication on\na conveyance of real estate depends on the intent of the parties, which must clearly\nappear in order to sustain an easement by implication.” ’ ” (Thorstrom v. Thorstrom\n(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1420, italics added (Thorstrom).) “ ‘ “The purpose of the\ndoctrine of implied easements is to give effect to the actual intent of the parties as shown\nby all the facts and circumstances.” [Citation.]’ ” (Ibid.; cf. Moores v. Walsh (1995)\n38 Cal.App.4th 1046, 1049.) Thus, an easement by implication will only be found when\nthere is “clear evidence” that the parties intended it “at the time of the original transfer of\nthe property” by the common grantor. (Tusher, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 143, italics\nadded; Thorstrom, supra, at p. 1420; Fristoe v. Drapeau (1950) 35 Cal.2d 5, 8.)\n       The claimant has the burden of proving each element of the cause of action for an\nimplied easement by a preponderance of the evidence. The trial court’s factual findings\nare binding on the appellate court if supported by substantial evidence. (6 Miller & Starr,\nCal. Real Estate, supra, § 15:19, p. 15-82, citing Tusher, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at\np. 145.) However, whether common ownership may be established by reference to\n\n\n\n8\n        Civil Code section 1104 reads: “A transfer of real property passes all easements\nattached thereto, and creates in favor thereof an easement to use other real property of the\nperson whose estate is transferred in the same manner and to the same extent as such\nproperty was obviously and permanently used by the person whose estate is transferred,\nfor the benefit thereof, at the time when the transfer was agreed upon or completed.”\n\n                                              19\n\ffederal patents presents a legal question which we review de novo. (Kellogg v. Garcia\n(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 796, 802-803.)\n       2. Common ownership is lacking.\n       The first required element is that the dominant and servient tenements were held\nby the same owner at the time of the conveyance giving rise to the implied easement.\n(Tusher, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 141.) The United States Government can be the\ncommon owner of land conveyed by a federal patent. (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at\np. 161.) However, “conveyances involving a sovereign as a common owner typically do\nnot give rise to implied reservations of easements.” (Id. at p. 165.)\n       In Murphy, the plaintiff seeking to establish an implied access easement by\nnecessity argued that the relevant conveyance was the first one in 1929, when the federal\ngovernment deeded the parcel containing the defendants’ servient property, reasoning the\ngovernment impliedly retained ownership of plaintiff’s dominant land and hence\nimpliedly reserved an access easement for itself. (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at pp. 167-\n168.) Conversely, the defendants fighting the easement across their land asserted that\ncommon ownership could not be established because the relevant conveyance was the\nlater 1932 patent deeding the plaintiff’s dominant tenement, by which time the\ngovernment no longer owned the servient property. (Id. at p. 168.) The Supreme Court\nin Murphy stated, “We agree that an easement by necessity cannot arise by implication\nfrom the 1932 conveyance because common ownership was lacking.” (Ibid.) Thus, the\nconveyance giving rise to the reservation of an easement by implication is the one\ntransferring the dominant tenement.\n       Here, just as in Murphy, the relevant conveyance is the patent to plaintiffs’\nSection 1 ancestor because plaintiffs seek to establish their right, as the dominant\ntenement holders, to use Henry Ridge Motorway as it crosses defendants’ servient\nproperties. However, plaintiffs’ property was patented in 1907, by which time the\nnortherly Erickson/Malick property had already been conveyed by patent in 1902 and the\nSchroder and southerly Erickson/Malick property had already been conveyed in 1903.\nThus, no easement can arise by implication because by the time the federal government\n\n                                             20\n\fissued the patent to plaintiffs’ predecessor in 1907, the United States no longer owned\nany of these servient tenements. (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 168.) The common\nownership element is missing.\n       Plaintiffs point out that Murphy concerned an easement by necessity, not at issue\nhere. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court’s holding still applies. Common ownership is an\nelement of both implied easements in general and implied easements by necessity.\n(Compare Tusher, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 141 & Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at\np. 167.) If the Murphy court declined to find an implied easement even though necessity\nmay have justified it, then certainly no easement should be inferred here where necessity\nis not even claimed.\n       We are mindful of the fact that the patent to Marshall’s predecessor in 1911 is\nlater than the patent to plaintiffs’ Section 1 land. Thus, the federal government was the\ncommon owner of Marshall’s and plaintiffs’ land at the time of relevant conveyance.\nHowever, even if plaintiffs might have an implied easement across Marshall’s property,\nthat is the extent of their right. Stated otherwise, plaintiffs’ implied easement for access\nwould end at the boundaries of Marshall’s land, and plaintiffs could travel no farther\nsouth without encroaching on the lands of Erickson/Malick and Schroder. We decline to\notherwise imply an access easement by necessity over Marshall’s property as there is no\nshowing of strict necessity. Plaintiffs’ land is by no means landlocked. (See, e.g.,\nMurphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 164.)\n       3. Plaintiffs produced no evidence that the federal government intended to reserve\nan access easement when it issued its patents.\n       Common ownership aside, the trial court erred in finding an easement by\nimplication across Marshall’s or any other defendant’s parcel because there is no clear\nevidence that the federal government intended to reserve an easement for access. The\nparties dispute whether the record shows the government’s intent to reserve an access\neasement. They focus on the use element of the cause of action. Plaintiffs argue the\nhomesteaders’ use is sufficient evidence; defendants counter that our focus should be on\nthe government’s actions. Again, Murphy controls.\n\n                                             21\n\f       The purpose of the doctrine of implied easements is to give effect to the actual\nintent of the parties based on all of the facts and circumstances. (Thorstrom, supra,\n196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420.) However, courts must be particularly vigilant “when\ncommon ownership is traced back to a federal grant made without an express reservation\nfor access.” (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 161.) “[C]onveyances involving a\nsovereign as the common owner typically do not give rise to implied reservations of\neasements or other property interests in conveyed land. [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 165,\nitalics added.) “[T]he distinctive nature and history of federal land grants and the\ngovernment’s power of eminent domain” have made courts reluctant “to interfere with\nthe certainty and predictability of land titles conferred by a sovereign without any express\nreservation of rights. [Citations.]” (Id. at pp. 161, 165, italics added.) Therefore, our\nSupreme Court instructs that “extreme caution must be exercised in determining whether\nthe circumstances surrounding a government land grant are sufficient to overcome the\ninference prompted by the omission of an express reference to a reserved right of access.\n[Citation.]” (Id. at p. 167, italics added.) “[W]hen a claimant traces common ownership\nback to the federal government and seeks to establish an implied reservation of an access\nright-of-way, the intent of Congress is paramount” and the “easement claimant bears the\nburden of producing evidence on the issues regarding the government’s intent to reserve\nan easement and the government’s lack of power to condemn.” (Ibid., italics added.)\n       The patents here were issued pursuant to the federal Homestead Act. “The\npertinent inquiry . . . is the intent of Congress when it granted land.” (Leo Sheep Co. v.\nUnited States (1979) 440 U.S. 668, 681 [involving Union Pacific Railroad Charter Act\nof 1862, Act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 489].) Plaintiffs have not pointed us to anywhere in\nthe Homestead Act or its legislative history that mentions reservations of access\neasements.\n       The patents likewise are silent about access easements, as plaintiffs acknowledge.\nNormally, federal patents contain no express reservation of easements for access.\n(Leo Sheep Co. v. United States, supra, 440 U.S. at p. 687 [“Generations of land patents\nhave issued without any express reservation of the right” for an access easement].) Here,\n\n                                             22\n\feach patent explicitly “reserve[s] from the lands hereby granted a right of way thereon for\nditches or canals constructed by the authority of the United States.” (Italics added.)\n“Given the existence of such explicit exceptions, this [Supreme] Court has in the past\nrefused to add to this list by divining some ‘implicit’ congressional intent.” (Leo Sheep\nCo. v. United States, at p. 679.) The omission from the patents in this case of a\nreservation of a right-of-way for access compels the conclusion that the federal\ngovernment had no intent to reserve an access easement on any trail or road that existed\nalong Henry Ridge. (See Hash v. U.S. (2005) 403 F.3d 1308, 1314 [no patent mentions\nreserving to U.S. any title, ownership interest, or reversionary right in land underlying\npreviously-granted railroad right-of-way].)\n       Plaintiffs argue that defendants had the burden to show an intent of Congress not\nto reserve a right of way. They quote Horowitz v. Noble (1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 120 that\nan easement will be implied unless the parties have expressed their intention to the\ncontrary. (Id. at pp. 132-133.) Horowitz is inapplicable because the litigants there were\nprivate parties. Where, as here, the common owner is the sovereign whose patents did\nnot expressly reserve access easements, the burden fell on plaintiffs as easement\nclaimants to produce evidence about the government’s intent. (Murphy, supra,\n46 Cal.4th at p. 167.) Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden to adduce any evidence, let\nalone clear evidence, that Congress intended to reserve an access road in these patents.\n       The trial court’s finding of an implied easement over Henry Ridge Motorway\nbased on the federal patents resulted from its misapplication of the law with respect to\ncommon ownership, and plaintiffs adduced no “clear evidence” of Congressional intent\nto reserve an access easement. Thus, the portion of the judgment establishing an implied\neasement must be reversed.\n       We turn to the trial court’s three bases for finding the roads were dedicated to\npublic use: (1) the patent theory, and (2) implied in law and (3) implied in fact\ndedication.]]\n                               [[End nonpublished portion]]\n\n\n                                              23\n\f                                 Dedication To Public Use\n       Defendants challenge the trial court’s interpretation and application of Civil Code\nsection 1009 in ruling that the two roads were dedicated to public use.\n       1. The law of public dedication\n       A dedication is the voluntary application of land “ ‘for some public use, made by\nthe fee owner, and accepted by the public. By virtue of this offer which the fee owner\nhas made, he is precluded from reasserting an exclusive right over the land now used for\npublic purposes.’ ” (Friends of the Trails v. Blasius (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 810, 820-821\n(Blasius); 10 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate, supra, § 26:1, pp. 26-3 to 26-4.)\n“Dedications may occur pursuant to statute or the common law. [Citation.]” (Blasius, at\np. 820.)\n       Common law dedications are either express or implied. Express dedication occurs\nwhen the landowner’s intent to dedicate is manifested by overt acts, such as by an\ninstrument. Implied dedication arises when, in the absence of overt acts, the evidence of\nthe landowner’s conduct or acquiescence supports the attribution of intent to dedicate.\n(Blasius, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 821.)\n       Dedications can be implied in law and implied in fact. A dedication is implied in\nlaw when the public’s use is adverse and exceeds the period for prescription. (Blasius,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 821; Cherokee Valley Farms, Inc. v. Summerville Elementary\nSch. Dist. (1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 579, 585 (Cherokee).) A dedication is implied in fact\n“when the period of public use is less than the period for prescription and the acts or\nomissions of the owner afford an implication of actual consent or acquiescence to\ndedication.” (Blasius, at p. 821, citing Union Transp. Co. v. Sacramento County (1954)\n42 Cal.2d 235, 241.)\n       In addition to an offer to dedicate, the record must show an acceptance by the\npublic. (10 Miller & Starr, supra, § 26:1, p. 26-5; Baldwin v. City of Los Angeles (1999)\n70 Cal.App.4th 819, 837.) Acceptance may also be express or implied. (Baldwin,\nsupra.) An express acceptance is a formal acceptance by the proper authorities. Implied\nacceptance occurs when “ ‘the public has made use of the property for a period of time\n\n                                              24\n\fwhich demonstrates an intention to accept dedication [citation] or where actions by the\nresponsible public officials indicate[ ] an assumption of control over the property.’\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.) Courts require an “unconditional and unqualified acceptance of the\noffer” to dedicate. (10 Miller & Starr, supra, § 26:1, p. 26-5.)\n       The evidence required for finding that a road was impliedly dedicated to public\nuse was delineated in Gion v. City of Santa Cruz (1970) 2 Cal.3d 29 (Gion). Under Gion,\n“[w]hat must be shown is that persons used the property believing the public had a right\nto such use. This public use may not be ‘adverse’ to the interests of the owner in the\nsense that the word is used in adverse possession cases. If a trial court finds that the\npublic has used land without objection or interference for more than five years, it need\nnot make a separate finding of ‘adversity’ to support a decision of implied dedication.”\n(Id. at p. 39.)\n       As for the type of use, those advocating implied public dedication must\ndemonstrate that people have “used the land as they would have used public land.”\n(Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 39.) Proponents of implied public dedication must show that\n“various groups” of people “have used the land,” not merely “a limited and definable\nnumber of persons.” (Ibid.) “ ‘[T]he thing of significance is that whoever wanted to use\n[the land] did so . . . when they wished to do so without asking permission and without\nprotest from the land owners.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 40.) Therefore, the use must be\n“substantial, diverse, and sufficient, considering all the circumstances, to convey to the\nowner notice that the public is using the passage as if it had a right so to do.” (Blasius,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 826, fn. 7.)\n       Whether there has been a dedication for public use is a factual question.\n(10 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate, supra, § 26:4, p. 26-11; Cherokee, supra,\n30 Cal.App.3d at p. 585.) Whether express or implied, “the fundamental requirement for\ndedication is the clear and unequivocal intent by the property owner to dedicate his or\nher property [for] public use” (10 Miller & Starr, supra, at p. 26-9) and the unconditional\nand unqualified acceptance of that offer. (Id., § 26:1, p. 26-5.)\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       2. Civil Code section 1009 prevents all public use after 1972, not just recreational\nuse, from ripening into an implied dedication to public use, and thus the trial court’s\ninterpretation and application of that statute was legal error.\n       On the heels of Gion, the Legislature enacted Civil Code section 1009, effective\nMarch 4, 1972 to prospectively abrogate that decision. (Blasius, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 822-823.)9 Subdivision (a) of section 1009 is a statement of the Legislature’s\nfindings that “[i]t is in the best interests of the state to encourage owners of private real\nproperty to continue to make their lands available for public recreational use;” that\nlandowners face the “threat of loss of rights in their property if they allow . . . the public\nto use, enjoy or pass over their property for recreational purposes;” and that the “stability\nand marketability of record titles is clouded by such public use, thereby compelling the\nowner to exclude the public from his property.” (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (a).)\n       Subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1009 declares that, notwithstanding lack of\nCivil Code sections 813 and 1008 notices [that use is permissive] by “a private owner of\nreal property,” “no use of such property by the public after the effective date of this\nsection shall ever ripen to confer upon the public or any governmental body or unit a\nvested right to continue to make such use permanently, in the absence of an express\nwritten irrevocable offer of dedication of such property to such use, made by the owner\nthereof in the manner prescribed in subdivision (c) of this section, which has been\naccepted by the county, city, or other public body to which the offer of dedication was\nmade . . . .” (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (b), italics added.)10\n\n\n9\n      The Legislature also amended Civil Code section 813. (Blasius, supra, 78\nCal.App.4th at p. 822.) That statute now provides that a recorded notice of the\nlandowner’s consent to public use for a described purpose constitutes conclusive\nevidence that subsequent use of the land is permissive. (See Blasius, at pp. 822-823.)\n10\n         Civil Code section 1009 reads in relevant part, “(a) The Legislature finds that: [¶]\n(1) It is in the best interests of the state to encourage owners of private real property to\ncontinue to make their lands available for public recreational use to supplement\nopportunities available on tax-supported publicly owned facilities. [¶] (2) Owners of\nprivate real property are confronted with the threat of loss of rights in their property if\n                                              26\n\f       Subdivision (e) exempts coastal property, not at issue here, from subdivision (b).\nSubdivision (f) sets forth the steps that a coastal landowner may take to prevent the\npublic use of coastal property from being used as evidence to support an implied\n\nthey allow or continue to allow members of the public to use, enjoy or pass over their\nproperty for recreational purposes. [¶] (3) The stability and marketability of record titles\nis clouded by such public use, thereby compelling the owner to exclude the public from\nhis property.\n        “(b) Regardless of whether or not a private owner of real property has recorded a\nnotice of consent to use of any particular property pursuant to Section 813 of the Civil\nCode or has posted signs on such property pursuant to Section 1008 of the Civil Code,\nexcept as otherwise provided in subdivision (d), no use of such property by the public\nafter the effective date of this section shall ever ripen to confer upon the public or any\ngovernmental body or unit a vested right to continue to make such use permanently, in\nthe absence of an express written irrevocable offer of dedication of such property to such\nuse, made by the owner thereof in the manner prescribed in subdivision (c) of this\nsection, which has been accepted by the county, city, or other public body to which the\noffer of dedication was made, in the manner set forth in subdivision (c). [¶] . . . [¶]\n        “(e) Subdivision (b) shall not apply to any coastal property which lies within 1,000\nyards inland of the mean high tide line of the Pacific Ocean, and harbors, estuaries, bays\nand inlets thereof, but not including any property lying inland of the Carquinez Straits\nbridge, or between the mean high tide line and the nearest public road or highway,\nwhichever distance is less.\n        “(f) No use, subsequent to the effective date of this section, by the public of\nproperty described in subdivision (e) shall constitute evidence or be admissible as\nevidence that the public or any governmental body or unit has any right in such property\nby implied dedication if the owner does any of the following actions: [¶] (1) Posts signs,\nas provided in Section 1008, and renews the same, if they are removed, at least once a\nyear, or publishes annually . . . in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or\ncounties in which the land is located, a statement describing the property and reading\nsubstantially as follows: ‘Right to pass by permission and subject to control of owner:\nSection 1008, Civil Code.’ [¶] (2) Records a notice as provided in Section 813. [¶]\n(3) Enters into a written agreement with any federal, state, or local agency providing for\nthe public use of such land. [¶] After taking any of the actions set forth in paragraph\n(1), (2), or (3), and during the time such action is effective, the owner shall not prevent\nany public use which is appropriate under the permission granted pursuant to such\nparagraphs by physical obstruction, notice, or otherwise.\n        “(g) The permission for public use of real property referred to in subdivision (f)\nmay be conditioned upon reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of such\npublic use, and no use in violation of such restrictions shall be considered public use for\npurposes of a finding of implied dedication.”\n\n                                            27\n\fdedication to the public, such as posting signs, recording Civil Code section 813 notices,\nor entering into an agreement with a governmental agency providing for the public use of\nthe land. (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (f)(1)-(3).)\n       Here, the trial court ruled that Civil Code section 1009 prevents only recreational\nuse of property from developing into a permanent vested right. Based on its statutory\ninterpretation, the court relied on evidence of public vehicular ingress and egress after\nMarch 4, 1972 to find that Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road were impliedly\ndedicated as public streets. Defendants contend that the trial court erred as a matter of\nlaw. They read Civil Code section 1009, subdivision (b) to preclude all use, not simply\nrecreational use, of private property from ever ripening into public dedications by\nimplication after the statute’s enactment.\n       What Civil Code section 1009 precludes is an issue of statutory construction.\n“Statutory construction is a question of law that courts review de novo. [Citation.] The\njudicial task in construing a statute is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent . . . .\n[Citations.] The words of the statute are given their ordinary and usual meaning and are\nconstrued in the context of the statute as a whole and the entire system of law of which it\nis a part. [Citations.] A court must harmonize a statute with other laws so as to give\neffect to all and avoid anomalies, if possible. [Citations.]” (Bostick v. Flex\nEquipment Co., Inc. (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 80, 108 (concurring opn. of Croskey, J.).)\n       “If the language of a statute is unambiguous, the plain meaning governs and it is\nunnecessary to resort to extrinsic sources to determine the legislative . . . intent.\n[Citation.] If the statutory language does not yield a plain meaning, a court may consider\nextrinsic indicia of intent, including the legislative history of a statute enacted by the\nLegislature . . . and the historical circumstances of the statute’s enactment. [Citations.]\n‘Finally, the court may consider the impact of an interpretation on public policy, for\n“[w]here uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will\nflow from a particular interpretation.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Bostick v. Flex\nEquipment Co., Inc., supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 108 (concurring opn. of Croskey, J.).)\n\n\n                                                28\n\f       Looking to the words of the statute, we conclude Civil Code section 1009 is not\nambiguous. Subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1009 bars all public use, not just\nrecreational use, from developing into an implied public dedication. Subdivision (b)\nbroadly declares that “no use” – not “no recreational use” – shall “ever” ripen into a\nvested right in the public, absent a written offer. “ ‘[W]hen one part of a statute contains\na term or provision, the omission of that term or provision from another part of the statute\nindicates the Legislature intended to convey a different meaning.’ [Citations.]” (Klein v.\nUnited States of America (2010) 50 Cal.4th 68, 80.) The absence of the word\n“recreational” from the phrase “no use” in subdivision (b) indicates that the Legislature’s\naim was to comprehensively preclude implied public dedications from arising from any\nkind of public use of private real property.\n       Pulido v. Pereira (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1246, concluded otherwise. Pulido\nstated that “use of such property” in subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1009 “refers\nback to subdivision (a)(1), which explains that the subject of the statute is the public\nrecreational use of private real property.” However, subdivision (b) of Civil Code section\n1009 defines the property to which it refers. The first clause of subdivision (b) reads\n“Regardless of whether or not a private owner of real property has recorded a notice of\nconsent to use of any particular property pursuant to Section 813 of the Civil Code or has\nposted signs on such property pursuant to Section 1008 of the Civil Code . . . .” (Italics\nadded.) The second clause of the same sentence declares, “no use of such\nproperty . . . shall ever ripen to confer” a vested right in the public by implication.\n(Italics added.) Reference back to subdivision (a) to define the type of property discussed\nin subdivision (b) is unnecessary because the operative sentence of subdivision (b)\ncontains its own definition, namely “any particular” private property.\n       Indeed, nowhere in the operative provisions of the statute is the word\n“recreational” found; “recreational” is only employed in the legislative findings in\nsubdivision (a) of Civil Code section 1009. “Legislative findings and statements of\npurpose in a statute’s preamble can be illuminating if a statute is ambiguous. [Citation.]\nBut a preamble is not binding in the interpretation of the statute.” (Yeager v. Blue Cross\n\n                                               29\n\fof California (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103, fn. omitted.) As noted, no ambiguity\nexists in the statute and so it is unnecessary to import the word “recreational” from the\nlegislative findings into the operative portions of the statute when the Legislature has\ndeclined to do so. The Legislature clearly intended Civil Code section 1009 to have\nbroader application than solely to recreational use.11\n       Viewing the statute as a whole (Bostick v. Flex Equipment Co., Inc., supra,\n147 Cal.App.4th at p. 107 (conc. opn. of Croskey, J.)), reinforces our conclusion.\nSubdivisions (e) and (f) of Civil Code section 1009 treat coastal property differently than\nnon-coastal land by exempting coastal property from the subdivision (b) comprehensive\nban on implied dedication. Coastal land remains subject to the implied dedication\ndoctrine. To prevent evidence of public use of coastal land from supporting a finding of\nimplied public dedication, an owner must affirmatively act by taking one of the three\nsteps listed in subdivision (f). “[C]ourts must strive to give meaning to every word in a\nstatute and to avoid constructions that render words, phrases, or clauses superfluous.\n[Citations.]” (Klein v. United States of America, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 80.) A\nconstruction of subdivision (b) to ban only recreational use from ripening into a\npermanent vested public right would eliminate the statute’s disparate treatment of coastal\nand non-coastal land.\n\n\n\n\n11\n        We disagree with the dicta to the contrary in Bustillos v. Murphy (2002)\n96 Cal.App.4th 1277. After reciting the legislative intent to encourage recreational use in\nCivil Code section 1009, subdivision (a), Bustillos stated, “The statute effectuates this\npurpose by providing that no recreational use of private property ‘shall ever ripen to\nconfer upon the public . . . a vested right to continue to make such use permanently’\nunless the property owner dedicates the land to public use and the dedication of property\nis accepted by the government. (Id., subd. (b).)” (Bustillos v. Murphy, at pp. 1280-1281,\nitalics added.) Bustillos inserted the word “recreational” into its reading of\nsubdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1009 where that word does not actually exist in\ncontravention of the rule that “[w]e may not make a silent statute speak by inserting\nlanguage the Legislature did not put in the legislation. [Citation.]” (Yeager v. Blue Cross\nof California, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p. 1103.)\n\n                                             30\n\f       Although we conclude that subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1009 clearly\napplies to all uses of private property, we recognize that other cases have interpreted that\nsection to apply only to recreational uses. (Pulido v. Pereira, supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1252 [statute is arguably ambiguous]; Bustillos v. Murphy, supra, 96 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1280-1281 [statute’s aim is clear]; Hanshaw v. Long Valley Road Assn. (2004) 116\nCal.App.4th 471.) Looking then to the Legislature’s intent, it reinforces our construction.\nThe Supreme Court in Gion clarified well-settled principles of implied dedication to the\npublic for recreational purposes in a coastal area. (County of Los Angeles v. Berk (1980)\n26 Cal.3d 201, 213.) With the passage of section 1009, the Legislature adjusted the\neffect of Gion on land along the coast, and precluded all post-1972 public use of\nnon-coastal private property from ripening into public dedication by implication. (See\nCiv. Code, § 1009, subds. (b) & (e).) The Legislature expressly designed Civil Code\nsection 1009 to “treat the effect of implied dedication differently in the coastal zone than\nin the remainder of the state.” (Assem. Com. on Planning and Land Use, Analysis of\nProposed Amendments to Sen. Bill No. 504, (1971 Reg. Sess.) July 20, 1971, p. 1, italics\nadded.)12 With passage of section 1009, “[t]he doctrine of implied dedication would be\ndeleted prospectively except for the ‘coastal zone’ . . . .” (Ibid., italics added.) More\nimportant, the statute was written to “[p]rohibit[] any use of private land, except specified\nocean frontage land, after [the] effective date of [the] act from conferring a vested right in\n[the] public . . . in [the] absence of [an] express written irrevocable offer [to dedicate\nmade] by owner of [the] property accepted by specified public agenc[ies]. With regard to\n\n12\n       We grant the July 6, 2012 request of Erickson/Malick, joined by Burke and\nMarshall, to take judicial notice of the legislative history of Civil Code section 1009.\nPlaintiffs oppose the request on the ground these documents were not before the trial\ncourt. However, the construction of a statute presents a purely legal question that we\nreview independently. (Audio Visual Services Group, Inc. v. Superior Court (2015)\n233 Cal.App.4th 481, 489; see Peart v. Ferro (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 60, 81, citing\nEvid. Code, §§ 452 & 459 [taking judicial notice of legislative history notwithstanding\nrespondents’ opposition on ground it was not introduced in trial court].)\n       Defendants’ request, filed on July 6, 2012, to take judicial notice of exhibits I\nand J is denied.\n\n                                              31\n\fspecified ocean frontage property, [section 1009] makes use by public inadmissible to\nprove implied dedication if specified actions are taken by owner.” (Legis. Counsel’s\nDig., Sen. Bill. No. 504 (1971 Reg. Sess. & 1971 1st Ex. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 136,\nitalics added; accord, Enrolled Bill Memorandum to Governor for Sen. Bill. No. 504\n(1971 Reg. Sess.) Oct. 7, 1971, p.1; Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008)\n42 Cal.4th 1158, 1169-1170 [Legislative Counsel’ summary are entitled to great weight].)\nAs shown, the express legislative purpose of Civil Code section 1009 is to encourage\nrecreational use of private property by preventing implied dedication of coastal property\nbased on public use if the landowner takes one of the specified steps in subdivision (f),\nwhile eliminating all implied dedication of non-coastal property to public use after March\n1972.\n        A contrary construction of Civil Code section 1009 undermines the Legislature’s\nfindings and purpose, namely “to encourage owners of private real property to continue\nto make their lands available for public recreational use” by enabling property owners to\nallow recreational use of their land without fear of risking a cloud on their title. (Civ.\nCode, § 1009, subd. (a).) To read subdivision (b) to apply only to recreational use would\ndiscourage non-coastal landowners, unable to distinguish between recreational and\nnonrecreational users, from allowing any entry on their inland property for fear that “non-\nrecreational” use would become permanent. Such a result would improperly thwart the\nstatute’s declared purpose and return the law to the state it was under Gion, thus defeating\nthe Legislature’s motive for enacting the statute.\n        The trial court followed Hanshaw v. Long Valley Road Assn., supra,\n116 Cal.App.4th 471, to find that Civil Code section 1009 only precluded common law\ndedications to public recreational use, but not to other uses such as vehicular ingress and\negress. Hanshaw rejected the landowner’s argument that Civil Code section 1009\nprevented application of a common law public dedication theory after 1972 in a case\ninvolving implied public dedication of an access road. Relying on the phrase “for\nrecreational purposes” in the subdivision (a)(2) legislative findings, the Hanshaw court\nheld that the statute applies only to preclude the ripening of recreational use into a public\n\n                                              32\n\fdedication. (Hanshaw, at pp. 484-485.) We decline to follow Hanshaw because it\nignored the interplay of all of the statute’s subdivisions and limited subdivision (b)’s\nbroad prohibition that “no use” “shall ever ripen to confer upon the public” a vested right\nto continue the use. (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (b), italics added; Jessen v. Mentor Corp.\n(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1489, fn. 10 [we are not bound by the contrary decision by\nanother appellate court; “ ‘there is no “horizontal stare decisis” within the Court of\nAppeal’ ”].)\n       For the foregoing reasons, Civil Code section 1009, subdivision (b) bars all use of\nprivate real property after March 1972, not just recreational use, from ripening into a\npublic dedication absent an express, written, irrevocable offer of such property to such\nuse, made according to subdivision (c).13\n       Here, to find implied dedication of the two roads to public use for vehicular\naccess, the trial court relied on witness testimony and recent photographs. Under Civil\nCode section 1009, subdivision (b), none of the testimony is admissible as all of it\nconcerned vehicular use of Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road between the\nlate 1970s and the first decade of the 21st century. No witness testified about using or\nseeing anyone else use these roads for vehicular access before March 1972. Even the\nMatriarch of Henry Ridge, Stewart, only moved to Henry Ridge Motorway in 1977.\nAlthough Stewart testified that the roads “have been used for fifty years,” this testimony\ndoes not begin to describe the number and variety of use that Gion and Blasius require to\nfind an implied dedication to public use. (Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at pp. 39-40; Blasius,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.4th at pp. 825-826, fn. 7.) Also, Stewart admitted that she had no\npersonal knowledge of anyone driving Gold Stone Road to Henry Ridge Motorway.\n\n\n\n13\n       The Los Angeles County Fire Department’s maintenance of the road until 1984 is\nnot admissible evidence of acceptance by the County of a dedication to public use. (Civ.\nCode, § 1009, subd. (b).) Not only does the record lack evidence of an express, written,\nirrevocable offer to the County, but the County ceased maintaining Henry Ridge\nMotorway because it was a private road.\n\n                                             33\n\f       The trial court additionally cited the express irrevocable offers to dedicate trail\neasements, which were executed after 1972, as evidence that Marshall, and the\npredecessors of the Schroders and Erickson/Malicks impliedly devoted these two roads to\nthe public as vehicular thoroughfares. An exception to the ban on post-1972 implied\ndedications occurs when the landowner records an express, written, and irrevocable offer\nto dedicate that is accepted by a governmental entity. (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (b).) We\nindependently construe these instruments which were executed after 1972. (City of\nManhattan Beach v. Superior Court (1996) 13 Cal.4th 232, 238.)\n       The landowners’ express dedication in these documents was for a “hiking and\nequestrian trail” a “trail easement,” and a “public access trails easement . . . limited to\nhiking and equestrian uses only.” (Italics added.) The latter dedication was also limited\nto daylight hours. Nothing could be more manifest: Marshall and the predecessors of the\nSchroders and Erickson/Malicks made irrevocable offers to dedicate easements for trail\npurposes only; there is nothing in the trail dedications indicating the intent to devote the\nportions of the trail on their property that coincides with Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold\nStone Road as public streets. The express dedication of property for public use for horses\nand pedestrians alone does not result in implied dedications of the same land as a street\nfor cars. (California etc. Co. v. Union etc. Co. (1899) 126 Cal. 433, 437 [express\ndedication of land for highway does not establish dedication of property for landing and\nwharves]; 26 Cal.Jur.3d (2008) Dedication, § 23, p. 46.) Thus, these instruments do not\ndedicate public roads for the unlimited vehicular access at anytime of the day and night\nthat plaintiffs seek.\n       Nor is the witness testimony about vehicular ingress and egress for general\npurposes after 1972 admissible to transform the express offer of a trail for public use into\na dedication of the roads as public streets. (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (b).) The Coastal\nCommission reports attached to the trail dedications require no more than public access\nfor recreational purposes. The reports cite Public Resources Code sections 30210\nthrough 30212, which concern access to the sea for recreational purposes and the findings\nare replete with references to public access to the Topanga-Henry Ridge Trail. More\n\n                                             34\n\fimportant, the reports reflect a concern about the “perception by the public that the areas\ninvolved are private” and a “ ‘feeling of trespass,’ ” contradicting the requirement of\nGion that people must use the roads “believing the public had a right to such use.”\n(Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 39.)\n       Finally, the trial court ruled that defendants’ acts of erecting gates and posting\nsigns were in response to the “continued heavy use of Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold\nStone Road by the public.” While that may be, no use of private inland property may\nripen into a permanent, vested, public right after 1972 “[r]egardless of whether or not a\nprivate owner of real property has recorded a notice of consent . . . pursuant to Section\n813 of the Civil Code or has posted signs on such property pursuant to Section 1008 of\nthe Civil Code.” (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (b).)\n       The trial court erred in relying on post-1972 evidence of public use, and the record\ncontains no express, written, irrevocable offer to dedicate the subject roads as public\nthoroughfares.\n                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n       [[Turning to pre-1972 use, as explained, the photographs that predate 1972 show\nthat the Topanga area was developing, but none shows development along Henry Ridge\nMotorway. Rather, all of the sites depicted on the maps from before 1972 are connected\nto roads other than Henry Ridge Motorway. Thus, these photographs do not give rise to a\nreasonable inference that the road was used during those years.\n       The trial court also cited the 1949 Easement, as well as the 1968 and 1970\nDeclarations as constituting offers to “dedicate these streets or other areas for public use”\nbecause these instruments used the word “dedicate” or evinced an intent to dedicate. The\ncourt quoted from Hays v. Vanek (1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 271, that “ ‘Dedicate’ is a term\nof art with a particularized legal meaning. [Citation.] It is highly unlikely [the grantor]\nwould have used the word in the . . . deed had he not intended the road to be a public\nroad.” (Id. at p. 282.)\n       However, resolution of this issue requires construction of the documents, and the\ninterpretation of deeds and other instruments is solely a judicial function unless the\n\n                                             35\n\finterpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence. (City of Manhattan Beach v.\nSuperior Court, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 238.) Upon inspection, none of the instruments\ncited by the trial court effectuated a dedication of Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone\nRoad to the public, their use of the word “dedication” in the titles notwithstanding.\nAlthough the grantors desired to subdivide and to provide the new parcels with access to\na public street, each of the documents explicitly declared “appurtenant” “easements for\nroad purposes” with the proviso that if final tract maps were recorded dedicating public\nstreets, or in the case of the 1949 Easement the state or county accepted it as a public\nroad, then the easements would no longer be effective. When a dedication is conditional,\nthe conditions precedent must occur or the offer is inoperative. (Cal. Water & Tel. Co. v.\nPublic Util. Com. (1959) 51 Cal.2d 478, 495.) The conditions in these instruments were\nnever satisfied: the “said map[s]” attached to the 1968 and 1970 Declarations are not\nfinal tract maps;14 no acceptance was recorded for any of these instruments; and no\ntestimony was introduced about public use before 1972 such as would constitute implied\nacceptance. Thus, neither the 1949 Easement, the 1968 Declaration, nor the 1970\nDeclarations constitutes a dedication of Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road to\nuse as public streets.\n       The trial court also found that the quad maps showed the two subject roads\nexisting in the same place they do today, and ruled that the roads’ very existence evinced\nan intent to dedicate them to the public. However, “the mere fact that a public map\nshows land to be laid out as a street is not evidence, in itself, of the owner’s dedication of\nthe land.” (26 Cal.Jur.3d, supra, § 73, p. 307.) The simple placement on a map cannot\nconstitute a dedication as a public road or there would be no private roads. Thus, if\npublic dedication is claimed based on recorded maps, the evidence must show the\n\n\n14\n       The trial court was influenced by the legend on the maps attached to two of the\n1970 Declarations which identified a line as indicating “Dedicated roads per attached\ndeclaration.” Such a legend does not create a dedication to public use where the express\nconditions for the dedication were never satisfied. (Cal. Water & Tel. Co. v. Public Util.\nCom., supra, 51 Cal.2d at p. 495.)\n\n                                              36\n\flandowner’s clear and unequivocal intent to so dedicate. (Ibid.) We are mindful that “it\nis not a trivial thing to hold that private property has been dedicated to public use.\n[Citations.]” (Hays v. Vanek, supra, 217 Cal.App.3d at p. 281.) There is no evidence\nthat the roads identified on the quad maps were actually adversely used by, or accepted\nby, the public according to Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at page 39. Under the circumstances,\nnone of the instruments or maps cited by the trial court constitutes “clear and unequivocal\nproof” of an implied in law dedication of Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone Road to\nthe public.\n       3. There is no evidence to support the trial court’s dedication theory based on the\npatents.\n       The trial court ruled that Henry Ridge Motorway and the portion of Gold Stone\nRoad that lies on the Burkes’ property where it connects with Greenleaf Canyon Road\nwere dedicated to public use before 1902, the date of the first patent, while the land was\nstill held by the federal government. For this finding, the court relied on section 2477,\nUnited States Revised Statutes, title 43 United States Code former section 932 (July 26,\n1866), 14 Stat. 2521, repealed by Pub.L. No. 94-579 (Oct. 21, 1976), 90 Stat. 2793\n(RS 2477). Defendants contend this finding was error.\n       Enacted in 1866, RS 2477 read, “ ‘The right of way for the construction of\nhighways over public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted.’ ” (Ball v.\nStephens (1945) 68 Cal.App.2d 843, 846 (Ball).) “ ‘The object of the grant was to enable\nthe citizens . . . to build and construct such highways across the public domain as the\nexigencies of their localities might require, without making themselves liable as\ntrespassers.’ [Citation.]” (Western Aggregates, Inc. v. County of Yuba (2002)\n101 Cal.App.4th 278, 295 (Western Aggregates).) Under RS 2477, if a public road\nexisted on the date the homesteader took title, the patented land was taken subject to that\nroad. (See Ball, supra, at p. 850.)\n       To determine whether an existing road was public, RS 2477 referred to applicable\nstate law governing dedications. (Western Aggregates, supra, 101 Cal.App.4th at p. 296;\ncf. Ball, supra, 68 Cal.App.2d at p. 846 [describing the law of RS 2477 as requiring\n\n                                              37\n\f“evidence of public use of the described route as a roadway”].) In California between\n1883 and 1935, a road was deemed public if built by the government or “dedicated or\nabandoned to the public . . . .” (Ball, at p. 846, quoting from Pol. Code, former § 2618.)\n       RS 2477 constituted the offer of dedication in California. (Western Aggregates,\nsupra, 101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 296, 298.) Acceptance could be implied by the conduct of\nthe public according to California’s law of dedication. (Ibid., citing Ball, supra,\n68 Cal.App.2d at p. 846.) As explained, proof of public use sufficient to constitute\nacceptance for purposes of RS 2477 involves a substantial, diverse use of the land as\npublic land would be used, by “various groups” of people for five years. (Gion, supra,\n2 Cal.3d at pp. 39-40; Blasius, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 826, fn. 7.) The period of\nacceptance by use ended when the homesteader entered the land. (Knapp v.\nAlexander Co. (1915) 237 U.S. 162, 167; United States v. Clarke (9th Cir. 1976)\n529 F.2d 984, 986.)15\n       In Ball, cited by the trial court here, the evidence was that “the road was well\ndefined and had been made so by public use.” Witnesses testified about the transition of\nthe route from a trail to a road suitable for automobiles and trucks. (Ball, supra,\n68 Cal.App.2d at pp. 847-848.) There was also evidence that “many people used the road\n\n15\n         Ball stated that the period of acceptance by use ended when the patent was issued,\ni.e., five years after the homesteader’s entry. (Ball, supra, 68 Cal.App.2d at pp. 847-\n848.) However, defendants convincingly argue that acceptance by use ended when a\nhomesteader entered the land. Once a homesteader entered the land under the\nHomestead Act, the land was no longer public because “entry for purposes of\nhomesteading . . . separated the land from the public domain.” (United States v. Clarke,\nsupra, 529 F.2d at p. 986.) The United States Supreme Court explained that upon entry,\nthe homesteader had a “preferential” or inchoate right to the land and once he fulfilled the\nconditions of the Homestead Act, “and receive[d] a patent vesting in him the complete\nlegal title, this title relates back to the date of the initiatory act, so as to cut off intervening\nclaimants.” (Knapp v. Alexander Co., supra, 237 U.S. at p. 167.) Thus, the period of\nacceptance of an RS 2477 offer to dedicate ended upon the homesteader’s entry and not,\nas Ball stated, “when the patent was issued.” (Ball, supra, 68 Cal.App.2d at pp. 847-\n848.) Plaintiffs unpersuasively reject this limitations argument derived from United\nStates Supreme Court authority, by noting that Ball, a state appellate court decision,\nstates otherwise. Even under Ball’s limitations period, the result here is the same.\n\n                                                38\n\ffor different purposes” such as “hunters, miners and vacationists. About 1905 numerous\nmining claims were located above the land defendant homesteaded and the locality\nattracted the attention of oil operators. A derrick was erected and work was done on a\nwell which was located more than a mile from the land in question . . . . Materials and\nsupplies were hauled to the well by a route which followed another canyon, but the trail\nleading down from the vicinity of the well toward defendant’s land was made into a road\nover which a two-horse wagon could pass.” This “[t]ravel was not merely occasional.”\n(Id. at pp. 848-849.) The evidence was sufficient to affirm the finding that the road was\npublic. (Id. at p. 845.)16\n       Here, the relevant evidence is that which shows public use of Henry Ridge\nMotorway, and that portion of Gold Stone Road which connects with Greenleaf Canyon\nRoad, for five years before 1897 when the homesteader must have entered the\nErickson/Malick north land. The record is devoid of any such evidence.\n       The trial court first cited the 1895 survey plat as evidence of public use. That\nsurvey depicts a “Road.” The trial court “inferred that it would not have been designated\nas a road where the current location of Henry Ridge Motorway exists absent use.” This is\nnot a legally permissible inference: The mere existence of a road on a map does not\nshow its use was public. “Whether it also became a public street did not depend upon the\nfact alone that the land appears on these maps as a public street, but whether the proof\nshowed that it had been offered for dedication, and accepted as such by user or\notherwise.” (Whelan v. Boyd (1892) 93 Cal. 500, 501; accord, Hays v. Vanek, supra,\n217 Cal.App.3d 271, 281 [declining to infer public use from mere designation of road as\n“ ‘first class’ ” on map; “such use is just as consistent with private easements by\nprescription or necessity or with implied private licenses as with public dedication”].)\nIf mere existence on a map were sufficient evidence of intent to dedicate a road to the\n\n16\n       Plaintiffs are wrong when they argue that the description of use in Ball was meant\nto show the evolution of the subject road. Ball distinguished the evidence predating the\npatent from the post-patent evidence, noting that only evidence of the former was\nrelevant to a dedication finding. (Ball, supra, 68 Cal.App.2d at pp. 848-850.)\n\n                                             39\n\fpublic, then all roads depicted on all maps would be impliedly dedicated to public use\nrendering the “use” requirement a nullity. The 1895 survey plat is not evidence of use.\n       The trial court inferred public use from the fact that patentees “and others” used\nthe “Road” for five years to meet the requirements of the Homestead Act. Yet, there is\nno evidence of “others.” Plaintiffs’ expert Stanley acknowledged that the only evidence\nof use was an inference from the fact of the homesteaders’ patents that those\nhomesteaders “used this road to get access.” Homesteaders alone do not constitute a\n“various group” or “diverse” use by the public as required by Gion and Blasius, and do\nnot amount to the same assortment of users cited as sufficient in Ball. Also, the record\ncontains evidence of fewer than a dozen patentees along Henry Ridge Motorway, which\nis a “limited and definable number of persons” and hence an insufficient amount.\n(Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 39.) Moreover, a private homesteader’s use for the purposes\nof obtaining fee title to the land by patent cannot also constitute public use that would\ndivest the same homesteader of his rights to that same land. (See, e.g., United States v.\nClarke, supra, 529 F.2d at p. 986.) For these reasons, the patentees are not evidence of\npublic use.\n       There is also insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that the part\nof Gold Stone Road at the Burkes’ driveway and Greenleaf Canyon Road was part of the\n“Road” in 1895 that later became Henry Ridge Motorway. “[W]e uphold the findings if\nsupported by substantial evidence. [Citations.]” (Thorstrom, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1417.) However, “[a] decision supported by a mere scintilla of evidence need not be\naffirmed on appeal. [Citation.] Furthermore, ‘[w]hile substantial evidence may consist\nof inferences, such inferences must be “a product of logic and reason . . . ; inferences that\nare the result of mere speculation or conjecture cannot support a finding\n[citations].’ [Citation.]” (In re Savannah M. (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1387, 1393-1394.)\n       The trial court here relied on two maps, neither of which supports the court’s\nfinding that before 1902, Henry Ridge Motorway was connected to what is now\nGold Stone Road. The first map was a composite created by Stanley who admitted her\ncreation did not show the 1895 “Road” connecting to Greenleaf Canyon Road, and who\n\n                                             40\n\ftestified only that “depending on how accurate this map is, [it shows a road] possibly also\ngoing over a portion of the land owned by Burke.” (Italics added.) This is rank\nspeculation. The second map the court cited was created by MacNeil, who testified he\nderived it from 1930s CSB maps which reflect potential as well as existing road\nalignments. More important, he testified that it was “never established that it was\n[Henry Ridge] Motorway all the way to [Greenleaf Canyon Road].” Thus, the court had\nno solid evidence on which to find that the Burkes’ portion of Gold Stone Road was once\npart of the 1895 “Road.”\n        Finally, none of the other evidence relied on by the trial court is substantial, and\nall of it postdates 1902. For instance, the 1908 map depicts a post office, two taverns,\nand a house. The map is too recent, and all of the sites listed thereon are located on roads\nother than Henry Ridge Motorway. Similarly, none of Stanley’s photographs shows use\non Henry Ridge Motorway. Indeed, the 1895 survey plat and Stanley’s testimony only\nconfirm that the 1895 “Road” did not connect to any destination-point, while there were\nother roads leading to the Section 1 and Section 7 patents. Considering all of the\nevidence adduced here, it amounts to the mere fact that a road existed on the 1895 survey\nplat and may have been used by a handful of homesteaders whose entry cut off public\nuse. These facts are insufficient as a matter of law to constitute a public acceptance of\nthe RS 2477 offer.17 Therefore, the trial court erred in ruling that Henry Ridge Motorway\nand a portion of Gold Stone Road were impliedly dedicated to the public based on RS\n2477.\n        The portion of the judgment declaring Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone\nRoad dedicated to public use must be reversed.18\n\n17\n      The Los Angeles County Fire Department’s maintenance of the road is not\nevidence of acceptance by the County of a dedication to public use. The County\nmaintained the road after 1902.\n18\n      As the result of our conclusion here that the portion of the judgment finding\nimplied easement and implied dedication to public use must be reversed, we need not\naddress defendants’ additional contentions on appeal.\n\n                                              41\n\f                                              II\n                                  PLAINTIFFS’ APPEAL\n       1. No express easement\n       Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that\nplaintiffs had failed to establish they had an express easement based on the 1968 and\n1970 Declarations.\n       Quoting from the express language of the 1968 and 1970 Declarations, these\ninstruments state that the grantors “hereby grant said easements to all owners, their heirs,\nsuccessors and assigns in [Sections 12 and 1, respectively] as said owners’ fee interest\nappear of record, the vesting of title to said easements to take effect upon recording in the\noffice of the County Recorder by any fee owner of a portion of said Sec. [12 and 1,\nrespectively] of an acceptance of said easements.” (Italics added.) There is no evidence\nthat acceptances were ever recorded.\n       Notwithstanding these instruments’ clear requirement of a recorded acceptance,\nplaintiffs contend the law does not require an acceptance and so that requirement is\n“repugnant to the grant itself.” Citing Stanley’s opinion testimony, plaintiffs also argue\nsuch “language was immaterial to the express grant of easement rights.”\n       Interpretation of these instruments is solely a judicial function unless it turns on\ncredibility of extrinsic evidence. (City of Manhattan Beach v. Superior Court, supra,\n13 Cal.4th at p. 238.) “Opinion testimony is inadmissible and irrelevant to adjudging\nquestions of law. [Citations.]” (Adams v. City of Fremont (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 243,\n266.) The instruments’ requirement of a recorded acceptance is clear and unassailable\nand so Stanley’s opinion is irrelevant. We cannot idly dismiss the acceptance language.\nFuture owners rely on the express language of the grants for certainty. It is undisputed\nthat no such acceptance of the easements in the 1968 and 1970 Declarations was\nrecorded. Therefore, the trial court did not err in ruling that plaintiffs had not proven\ntheir right to an access easement by express grant.\n\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\f       2. No easement by prescription\n       Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in ruling they did not establish an easement\nfor ingress and egress across Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road by\nprescription. The prescriptive period is an uninterrupted five years. (Warsaw v. Chicago\nMetallic Ceilings, Inc. (1984) 35 Cal.3d 564, 570-571.) “[A] party seeking to establish a\nprescriptive easement has the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Grant v. Ratliff (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1304, 1310.) The court ruled, “As\nto the Prescriptive Easement, the Court’s concern is that it could not determine the exact\n5 year period necessary to meet the elements.”\n       The evidence is disputed. Scher testified he used the roads 1,400 times between\n1998 and 2005. Plaintiff McAllister testified she used the road 6-14 times per week\nduring this same period. In contrast, a witness who lived on the Schroders’ property\nbetween 1993 and 2005 did not believe these claims “for a moment.” Another resident\non the Schroders’ property testified that the claimed use of “200 times per year” was\nimpossible given that that resident watched the property carefully beginning in 1991 and\nturned people back. The Schroders never saw Scher or McAllister drive along\nGold Stone Road. Erickson saw Scher “twice in the 20 years that I’ve been there” and\nsimply did not think it was possible that McAllister used the road as often as she claimed.\nMalick never saw either plaintiff use the subject roads. Marshall and the Burkes\nacknowledged only that they saw “people” on the roads.\n       Plaintiffs argue the record contains adequate evidence of their use for the\nprescriptive period because the trial court found earlier in its statement of\ndecision: “Here, until 2006, the continuous, unobstructed and unimpeded use of\nHenry Ridge Motorway and [Gold Stone] Road by Plaintiffs, other residents, the\nDefendants themselves, strangers, delivery drivers, workers, motorcyclists, lookie-loos,\nand teenagers, among others, constitutes sufficient public use to accept the implied\ndedication of the roads.” (Italics added.) This statement is irrelevant because it was\nmade in conjunction with the trial court’s finding of an implied dedication to use by the\npublic, which requires a diverse collection of users. The statement does not segregate\n\n                                             43\n\fplaintiffs’ use. By contrast, in declining to find a prescriptive easement, the trial court\nfound that plaintiffs’ use was not continuous for five years.\n       Plaintiffs filed no objections to the statement of decision and so the doctrine of\nimplied findings applies. “The doctrine of implied findings requires the appellate court to\ninfer the trial court made all factual findings necessary to support the judgment.\n[Citation.]” (Fladeboe v. American Isuzu Motors Inc. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 42, 58.)\nParties must “point out deficiencies in the trial court’s statement of decision as a\ncondition of avoiding [the doctrine of] implied findings.” (In re Marriage of Arceneaux\n(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1130, 1134.) Under the doctrine of implied findings, where the\nevidence is in dispute, we must infer that the court did not believe plaintiffs’ assertion\nthat their own use was continuous for five years, or at the very least, that plaintiffs failed\nto demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence which continuous five years they used\nthe roads.\n       3. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to declare an equitable\neasement.\n       Plaintiffs challenge the trial court’s finding that they failed to provide sufficient\nevidence to support their claim for equitable easement.\n       “Through the doctrine of ‘balancing conveniences’ or ‘relative hardship,’ the trial\ncourt may create an easement by refusing to enjoin an encroachment or nuisance.”\n(Linthicum v. Butterfield (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 259, 265 (Linthicum).)\n       “In appropriate cases in which the requirements for traditional easements are not\npresent, California courts have exercised their equity powers to fashion protective\ninterests in land belonging to another, sometimes referring to such an interest as an\n‘equitable easement.’ [Citations.]” (Tashakori v. Lakis (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1003,\n1008 (Tashakori).) Three factors must be present to create an equitable\neasement: “(1) [the trespasser’s] trespass was ‘ “innocent” ’ rather than ‘ “willful or\nnegligent,” ’ (2) the public or the property owner will not be ‘ “ ‘irreparabl[y]\ninjur[ed]’ ” ’ by the easement, and (3) the hardship to the trespasser from having to cease\nthe trespass is ‘ “ ‘greatly disproportionate to the hardship caused [the owner] by the\n\n                                              44\n\fcontinuance of the encroachment.’ ” ’ [Citations.]” (Shoen v. Zacarias (2015)\n237 Cal.App.4th 16, 19.)\n       “When reviewing a trial court’s exercise of its equity powers to fashion an\nequitable easement, we will overturn the decision only if we find that the court abused its\ndiscretion. [Citation.]” (Tashakori, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1008.)\n       In Linthicum, the trial court found that the contested roadway “is the only access to\nthe Butterfields’ parcels” and that the Butterfields would suffer “catastrophic loss” were\nthe easement not created. By contrast, the roadway did not affect Linthicum’s right to\nfully develop his parcel. (Linthicum, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p. 266, italics added.)\nSimilarly, the Tashakori court applied the relative hardship test and found that the\ndefendants would suffer virtually no harm from the plaintiffs’ use of the shared driveway,\nwhereas the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed because the easement was the sole\nmeans of accessing the property. (Tashakori, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1010.)\n       Here, plaintiffs contend they will be irreparably harmed, not because Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road is the only means of reaching their Section 1 property,\nas there are several other routes plaintiffs can use to travel from their Section 1 property\nto Topanga. Rather, plaintiffs argue Henry Ridge Motorway to Gold Stone Road “is the\nquickest and most convenient route.” (Italics added.) Convenience is not sufficient\nunder Linthicum or Tashakori, certainly not when compared to the irreparable harm to\ndefendants by making their private, secluded land open to plaintiffs’ convenience.\nPlaintiffs contend they will suffer irreparable harm if they cannot use Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road in case of emergency. However, we accept the\nrepresentation of the Erickson/Malicks and Schroders that they would allow plaintiffs to\nuse these roads in emergencies. As for plaintiffs’ Section 12 lot, Henry Ridge Motorway\nand Gold Stone Road do not even touch it, with the result there are no equities in\nplaintiffs’ favor with respect to that land.\n       Finally, considering the parties’ conduct to determine who is responsible for the\ndispute, plaintiffs are not innocent. (Tashakori, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1009;\nLinthicum, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at pp. 266-267.)

After trial to\nthe bench, the court ruled that the two roads had been dedicated as public streets, and that\nplaintiffs, Jaime A. Scher and Jane McAllister, had an implied easement over the roads\nfor access to their property. Defendants,1 all of whom own land along the two roads\nsouth of plaintiffs’ property, appeal from the portion of the judgment burdening their land\nand enjoining them from obstructing vehicular access. The court also found that\nplaintiffs had not established their right to an express, prescriptive, or equitable easement\nfor access along the roads and across defendants’ properties. Plaintiffs appeal from this\npart of the judgment in favor of defendants.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that Civil Code section 1009 bars\nall use of non-coastal private real property, not simply recreational use of such property,\nfrom ever ripening into an implied dedication to the public after the effective date of that\nstatute. Hence, the trial court erred in considering evidence about use of the subject roads\nafter March 4, 1972 to support its finding that the roads were impliedly dedicated to\npublic use.\n       In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we hold that the trial court misapplied\nthe law when it ruled that plaintiffs have an implied easement that arose before 1902,\nwhile the land was still owned by the federal government. We also conclude that the\ncourt erred in ruling that the two roads were dedicated to public use during that time.\nThere is no evidence of the roads’ use before 1972 such as would support a finding that\n\n1\n      Defendants are Gemma Marshall, Richard Erickson and Wendie Malick,\nRichard B. and Andrea D. Schroder, Christina Erteszak, Northern Trust Bank, N.A.,\nBennett Kerns, Trustee of the A.S.A. Trust, dated June 28, 2005 “on behalf of\nJohn Burke & Germaine Burke,” John F. and Germaine Burke.\n\n                                               2\n\fthey were impliedly dedicated as public streets. With respect to plaintiffs’ appeal, we\nconclude that the trial court did not err in ruling that plaintiffs failed to prove they had an\nexpress easement or an easement by prescription, or were entitled to an equitable\neasement.\n       Accordingly, the portion of the judgment against defendants is reversed and the\nportion of the judgment against plaintiffs is affirmed.\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       For simplicity, we will not identify the parties’ predecessors in title. (Cf. Jones v.\nTierney-Sinclair (1945) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1136589\"><a href=\"/opinion/1136589/jones-v-tierney-sinclair/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The land in the area at issue\n       In the late 1700s, the federal government began surveying the western\nUnited States pursuant to the Public Land Survey System.2 The government divided the\nland into “townships,” and split each township into 36 square-mile “sections.” At issue\nhere are Sections 1, 7, and 12, in a township located in the Santa Monica Mountains.\n       The two roads at issue are Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road.3 Henry\nRidge Motorway runs approximately north/south along Henry Ridge, above Topanga\nCanyon, from Alta Drive in Section 1 in the north to near its southern end where it\nconnects with Gold Stone Road in Section 12. The junction between Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road is a hairpin turn where Henry Ridge Motorway\nmeasures about 12 feet wide. Gold Stone Road runs from Henry Ridge Motorway\neasterly into Section 7 where it terminates at Greenleaf Canyon Road, a public street.\n\n\n\n2\n        We grant defendants’ motion filed on July 6, 2012, to take judicial notice of an\narticle from the United States Department of the Interior’s website concerning the Public\nLand Survey System, <http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/a_plss.html>.\n3\n      Gold Stone Road is identified in the record variously as “Goldstone” Road and\n“Gold Stone” Road. For consistency, and following the parties’ lead, we will use the\ntwo-word name.\n\n                                               3\n\fGreenleaf Canyon Road ends in the south at Topanga Canyon Boulevard, which\neventually leads further south to the town center of Topanga.\n       From the north, Henry Ridge Motorway may be reached from Mulholland\nBoulevard via Adamsville Avenue and Alta Drive, both public roads, or Oldfield Ranch\nRoad and Summit to Summit Road. From the south, Henry Ridge Motorway was\naccessible from School Road until the early 1990s when the school district installed\ngates. Now, the only outlet from the southerly part of Henry Ridge Motorway is through\nGold Stone Road to Greenleaf Canyon Road.\n       Plaintiffs’ land is the northernmost of the parties’ properties on Henry Ridge\nMotorway in Section 1; all of defendants’ properties lie to the south of plaintiffs’ land.\nFrom Alta Drive south through plaintiffs’ property, Henry Ridge Motorway is paved.\nImmediately south of plaintiffs’ property lie four successive parcels owned by non-\nparties where Oldfield Ranch Road branches off to the east. At some point, the pavement\nceases and Henry Ridge Motorway is indicated on a local map as a “trail.” Defendant\nMarshall owns the next southerly parcel on the unpaved trail, also in Section 1. Abutting\nMarshall to the south, where Section 12 commences, lie two parcels on Henry Ridge\nMotorway owned by defendants Erickson and Malick. (We will refer to these parcels as\nErickson/Malick north and Erickson/Malick south, respectively.) Henry Ridge\nMotorway divides the Erickson/Malick south parcel to the west from the Schroder\ndefendants’ property to the east. Henry Ridge Motorway turns into Gold Stone Road as it\nbends generally eastward through the Schroder property toward Section 7. There, it cuts\nacross land owned by defendant A.S.A. Trust, Kerns Trustee, and crosses onto the Burke\ndefendants’ property. The Burkes’ driveway opens onto Greenleaf Canyon Road.\n       Plaintiffs also own an undeveloped lot off of Old Topanga Canyon Road in\nSection 12 that does not touch on Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone Road.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n       [[2. The evidence of the roads’ existence\n       a. the 1895 survey plat\n       Soon after California became a state, the federal government surveyed the\nTopanga Canyon area. A survey plat dated 1895 is divided into section squares, like\ngraph paper. In Sections 1 and 12, the 1895 survey plat shows a dotted line lying next to\na solid-line “Road,” located generally in the area of Henry Ridge Motorway wending\nroughly along the ridge line, across the land corresponding to property now owned by\nMarshall, Erickson/Malick, and Schroder. Exactly where the “Road” lay in 1895 cannot\nbe established. At the time, the property belonged to the United States Government.\nThe 1895 survey plat also reflects a dotted-line identified as a “Trail” lying to the east of\nthe “Road,” and located in Section 1 generally where Greenleaf Canyon Road lies now.\nPlaintiffs’ title expert Anya Stanley inferred from the survey plat that in 1895, the “Road”\nalong Henry Ridge was more established than the “Trail.”\n       Viewing a composite map that she compiled from the 1895 survey plat, Stanley\nsurmised, although acknowledging it was difficult to decipher, that while still federal\nland, the “Road” extended along what is now Henry Ridge Motorway, through\nMarshall’s, Erickson/Malicks’, and Schroders’ land, and may “possibly, depending upon\nhow accurate this [composite] map is,” have crossed land now owned by the Burkes.\nStanley acknowledged that her compilation map did not actually show this “Road”\nconnecting to Greenleaf Canyon. By contrast, defendants’ expert surveyor John MacNeil\nexplained that the surveyors’ task in 1895 was to set the section corners, not survey\nroads. MacNeil pointed out that the 1895 survey plat upon which Stanley relied was not\nintended to plot the course of a road, but only to show that it existed.\n       Stanley did not know who built the “Road” along the ridge line or whether the\nfederal government improved the “Road” before 1911. Stanley postulated that early\nnative American traders may have used the “Trail.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       b. the United States Government homestead patents\n       The parties in this case trace their titles to grants issued under the federal\nHomestead Act (Act of May 20, 1862, ch. 75, §§ 1-8, 12 Stat. 392; Act of Mar. 3, 1855,\nch. 207, 10 Stat. 701; Act of Apr. 24, 1820, ch. 51, 3 Stat. 566; Murphy v.

The Homestead Act required those seeking to own land\nto occupy and cultivate or mine up to 160 acres for at least five years and then file an\napplication to the United States Government for a patent. A patent is the official\ndocument reflecting the federal grant conferring fee simple title to public land.\n(Murphy v. Burch, supra, at p. 162 & fn. 1 (Murphy).)\n       Records from the Federal Bureau of Land Management and the Los Angeles\nCounty Recorder’s Office show that the United States issued a patent for the\nErickson/Malick north property in 1902. The patent covering the Erickson/Malick south\nproperty and the Schroder property was issued in 1903. The patent for plaintiffs’ land is\ndated 1907. The predecessors of Marshall and of the Burkes each obtained their patents\nin 1911. The parties own only portions of the properties originally patented to their\npredecessors. Over the past century and a half, all of the homesteaded land has been\nsubdivided into smaller parcels. The patents in this case specifically reserved to the\nUnited States previously vested and accrued water rights, previously granted mineral\nrights, and rights-of-way for ditches and canals.\n       c. the 1908 map\n       A map of Topanga in 1908, derived by MacNeil from earlier maps, labeled the\n“Road” from the 1895 survey plat as the “Ridge Trail,” while the 1895 “Trail” became\n“Greenleaf Road.” The 1908 map does not clarify the locations of the 1895 “Road” or\nthe 1908 “Ridge Trail.” Stanley testified the route of the “Ridge Trail” has changed since\nthe 19th century. For example, the 1908 “Ridge Trail” is not identical to what is now\nHenry Ridge Motorway because the modern road extends farther north than in 1895, and\nwas reconfigured in the south to follow a straighter path into what is now School Road.\nMacNeil created the 1908 map from the 1895 survey plat, never intending it to constitute\n\n                                               6\n\fa survey of the location of Henry Ridge, and so he testified it was “never established that\nit was [Henry Ridge] Motorway all the way to [Greenleaf Canyon Road].” The 1895\nsurvey plat and the 1908 map do not identify the roads’ actual locations a century ago,\nand there is no other evidence to indicate whether today’s Henry Ridge Motorway exists\nin the same location as “Ridge Trial” did on the 1908 map, or in 1902 when the first\npatent was issued in this case.\n       d. maps from the 1930s\n       No road or trail is identified in that area on the “Early subdivisions and points of\ninterest map of Topanga Canyon in the 1930s.” What was identified as the “Trail” in the\n1895 survey plat and “Greenleaf Road” in 1908, became “Greenleaf Canyon Road” on\nthe 1930s map.\n       “Henry Ridge Motorway” first appears by that name in CSB maps from the 1930s.\nCSB maps are County of Los Angeles surveys that define alignments of proposed as well\nas existing roads. The CSB maps from 1935 and 1937 depict “Henry Ridge Motorway”\nas extending north all the way to Mulholland Drive, which was a “major public street”\nthen. In the 1930s, Cal-Trans considered a “motorway” to be a banked road that either\nwas or would be graded to accommodate motor vehicles, as opposed to a horse-drawn\ncarriages or stage coaches. More recently, the County defined “Motorway” as “[a] truck\ntrail or trail through mountainous terrain, usually for fire equipment usage or service\naccess; e.g., power lines, Nike sites, etc. Not for public use.”4 (Italics added.) In the late\n\n\n\n4\n       We grant defendants’ request to take judicial notice of the Street Name Policy of\nthe County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works as of June 28, 1999, and the\nHouse Numbering and Street Naming Manual of the Los Angeles Department of Public\nWorks, dated April 1999. Plaintiffs oppose the request on the ground this document was\nnot before the trial court. However, the naming of a street is a legislative act (Gov. Code,\n§ 34091.1) and the question of what “Motorway” means is a question of law, which we\nindependently decide, regardless of whether the issue was before the trial court. (Burden\nv. Snowden (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1171417\"><a href=\"/opinion/1171417/burden-v-snowden/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 [“As the matter is a question of law, we are not\nbound by evidence on the question presented below or by the lower court’s\ninterpretation.”].)\n\n                                              7\n\f1930s, the County Fire Department built and graded Henry Ridge Motorway from\nAdamsville Road to School Road in case of brush fire.\n       e. the 1949 Easement – Sections 7 & 12\n       In 1949, a predecessor-in-interest of the Burkes granted to the prior owner of the\nSchroder and Erickson/Malick south properties an “appurtenant” easement “for roadway\npurposes” for “ingress to and egress from the said Greenleaf Canyon Road to the property\nof” the Schroder and Erickson/Malick south parcels in Sections 7 and 12 respectively.\n(The 1949 Easement) The 1949 Easement over Burke’s property ran generally where\nGold Stone Road today crosses the Burke land, and was “just a drive, private driveway”\nthen. The grant further provided that “in the event” the state or county “accept[ed] the\nroadway as a public road,” then the grantor and her successors in interest “consent[ed] to\nthe dedication of the said road.” (Italics added.) The record contains no acceptance by a\npublic entity. The 1949 Easement burdens Burkes’ property and benefits the\nErickson/Malick south and Schroder properties, but does not benefit plaintiffs’ Section 12\nproperty.\n       f. the 1950 maps\n       Witnesses testified that Henry Ridge Motorway’s route has changed over the\nyears. There have been minor changes in the road’s alignment. It was straightened out\nand paved in part. The road previously went over the top of a ridge on plaintiffs’\nproperty. Henry Ridge Motorway was moved to the west as much as 150 feet to a\nlocation down along the side of a hill. Also, the road once came within 40 feet of\nplaintiffs’ house. MacNeil did a comparison of Henry Ridge Motorway in 1952 to the\n1895 survey plat and found that in some places the road had moved four to five hundred\nfeet. The first time “Goldstone Road” was shown on a map, was in a 1952 CSB map.\n       g. the 1960s maps and the Thomas Brothers’ Guide Maps\n       Henry Ridge Motorway was still not much of a road in the 1960s despite its\ndepiction on the 1930s CSB maps. Two government maps from 1967 reflect\n“Henry Ridge” as a nameless, “unimproved dirt” road. Although the phrase\n“HENRY RIDGE” appears in all capital letters on the 1967 maps, all of the roads in the\n\n                                             8\n\farea, including large roads such as Topanga Canyon Boulevard, are identified in lower\ncase letters. One of the 1967 maps indicates an unimproved dirt road in the general\nvicinity of what is now Gold Stone Road.\n       Thomas Brothers’ Guide maps from 1960 and 1966 show a road identified as\n“Henry Ridge Road” and “Henry Ridge Motorway.” Neither shows Gold Stone Road or\na road where Gold Stone Road lies today. The Thomas Brothers’ Guide maps in 1983\nlist Gold Stone Road as a private dirt road. Gold Stone Road was first paved around\n1987. The Thomas Brothers maps in 1996 and 2001 show “Henry Ridge Mtwy” and\n“Gold Stone Road.” Stanley acknowledged that Thomas Brothers Guides sometimes\ncontained errors and showed roads that do not actually exist.\n       h. the 1968 Declaration of Easement – Section 12\n       In 1968, the owner of the property comprised of the Schroder and\nErickson/Malick’s southern parcels in Section 12, decided to subdivide the land into four\nparcels, A through D. To provide the new parcels with access to a public street, i.e.,\nGreenleaf Canyon Road, the grantor recorded a “Declaration and Grant of Easements”\nfor “road purposes and to be appurtenant to all land in said Sec. 12” as depicted on an\nattached map (1968 Declaration).\n       The 1968 Declaration specifies that its easement offer would “tak[e] effect upon”\nthe recording by any Section 12 fee owner of an “acceptance.” Additionally, the 1968\ndeclaration mimics the language of the 1949 Easement as it was also made “with the\nunderstanding that in the event a final tract map or parcel map [were recorded] over any\nportion of this division dedicating . . . to public use streets . . . which are accepted by the\nCounty,” the easement “shall no longer be of any force or effect.” (Italics added.)\nNeither an acceptance of the easement by the fee owner, nor a final tract or parcel map\nwas ever recorded. The easement’s route as depicted on the map attached to the 1968\nDeclaration differs considerably from the route of Gold Stone Road today. Also, as there\nis no evidence of any consent to change the easement’s route to conform to the current\nroad, there are portions of southerly Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road over\nwhich the 1968 Declaration does not appear to grant an easement.\n\n                                               9\n\f       i. the 1970 Easement Declarations – Sections 1 & 12\n       On July 16, 1970, the owner of land now held by Marshall, the previous owner of\nErickson/Malick’s northern parcel, and the predecessor of McCoy who is not a party to\nthis lawsuit, executed identical instruments, all signed by the same person and recorded\non the same day, entitled “Declaration and Grant of Easements” (the 1970 Declarations).\nUsing almost the same language as the 1968 Declaration, the three 1970 Declarations\nwere designed to facilitate a proposed division of the relevant land in Sections 1 and 12\ninto smaller parcels. Accordingly, the 1970 Declarations created strips of land shown on\nattached maps to be “easements for road purposes and to be appurtenant to all land” in\nthe respective sections, namely Section 1 for the Marshall property, and Section 12 for\nthe Erickson/Malick north property, “the vesting of title to said easements to take effect\nupon recording . . . by any fee owner of a portion of said Sec. . . . of an acceptance of\nsaid easements.” (Italics added.) The record contains no acceptance. There is\nconflicting evidence about the route of the easements and dedicated road created by the\n1970 Declarations.\n       The 1970 Declarations also state: “OWNER makes this declaration with the\nunderstanding that in the event a final tract map or parcel map is caused to be filed with\nthe County Recorder over any portion of this division, dedicating or deeding to public use\nstreets and highways for said map which are accepted by the County of Los Angeles, this\ndeclaration insofar as said lands are affected by said final tract map or parcel map, shall\nno longer be of any force or effect.” (Italics added.) The legends on two of the maps\nattached to the three 1970 Declarations indicate a solid line representing “Dedicated\nroads, per attached declaration . . . .” No acceptance of any of the 1970 Declarations was\nrecorded. Neither the Marshall nor the Ericson/Malick north properties was subdivided\naccording to the 1970 Declarations.]]\n                               [[End nonpublished portion]]\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       3.

As a condition to granting the permit, the Coastal\nCommission required Marshal to “record” an instrument “irrevocably offering to\ndedicate . . . an easement for a hiking and equestrian trail for public use” of the\nTopanga-Henry Ridge Trail, which crosses part of Henry Ridge Motorway on her land.\nMarshall’s 1989 irrevocable offer “dedicate[d] to the People of California an easement in\nperpetuity for the purposes of hiking and equestrian trail . . . .” (Italics added.)\n       The attached Coastal Commission Staff Report and Recommendations found and\ndeclared that “The Topanga-Henry Ridge Trail traverses the private access road\n(Henry Ridge Motorway) . . . .” (Italics added.) Continuing, the report states, “these\nprivately maintained roads have become commonly used recreational links between\ngrowing centers of development in the mountains. While currently unimproved, these\nroads . . . functioned as public thru-ways and have historically been open to unobstructed\nvehicular and pedestrian traffic. It is likely that demand for this particular trail will\nincrease as the immediate area is built out.” (Italics added.) “Henry Ridge Motorway is\ncommonly used by equestrians, hikers, and joggers. Formal dedication may not be\nnecessary to continue the use of this trail, because as in the case of other commonly used\ntrails in the mountains, there is strong likelihood that prescriptive rights have been\nestablished.” (Italics added.)\n       b. trail dedication on Henry Ridge Motorway by predecessors of the Schroders\nand Erickson/Malicks\n       In 1992, prior owners of the Schroder and Erickson/Malick south properties in\nSection 12 recorded an “Irrevocable Offer to Dedicate Trail Easement and Declaration of\nRestrictions,” the purpose of which was to “allow[] public pedestrian and equestrian\ningress and egress and for public recreational purposes.” (Italics added.) The Dedication\naffected a 20-foot wide strip of property that was contiguous with, and over the portion of\nTopanga-Henry Ridge Trail that lies within the owner’s parcel, and specifically limited\n\n                                              11\n\fthe “right of public use of the easement” “to daylight hours, from one hour before sunrise\nto one hour after sunset.” The offer did not involve Gold Stone Road.\n       As reflected in the document, this trail dedication was a condition of a Coastal\nCommission development permit. The Dedication states that “the Property is a parcel\ntraversed by a trail used for public recreation and access . . . .” The declaration contained\nthe condition that the grantors would not interfere “with [the] present public use of this\nroad.” (Italics added.) The restriction provides that the offer of dedication shall not be\n“construed to allow anyone, prior to acceptance of the Offer, to interfere with any rights\nof public access acquired through use which may exist on the Property.” (Italics added.)\n       The attached staff report reflects the Coastal Commission’s mounting concern\nabout the effects of increased development in the area on recreational use. The report\nnotes that Henry Ridge Trail provides access and helps to connect areas with the\n“remainder of the trail system.” These trails “have become important and commonly\nused recreational assets and a means of providing access to and links between natural,\nscenic, and recreational areas in the mountains.” However, “[r]esearch has shown that a\nmajor deterrent to public use of recreational trails and similar public recreation areas and\nfacilities is a perception by the public that the areas involved are private.” The report\nobserves that “development tends to preempt public access, partly due to the ‘feeling of\ntrespass’ engendered by the predominance of private development” and notes the\nnecessity of placing conditions on development “to formalize the public’s right to\ncontinued use of these trails.”5 (Italics added.)\n       4. Use of Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road by plaintiffs and others\n       Much of this lawsuit concerns whether and in what manner Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road were used by the public.\n\n\n\n5\n        Plaintiffs introduced into evidence numerous other documents and instruments in\ndefendants’ various chains of title. We will not include these exhibits here because they\nare not cited by the trial court and the evidence does not show that these instruments\naffect the result here.\n\n                                             12\n\f                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n        [[a. Pre-1972\n        Unable to locate eyewitnesses from the 1800s through the early 1900s, plaintiffs\nrelied on inferences from photographs, lot books, the parties’ chains of title, historical-\nsociety documents, and the above-described maps and instruments. The 1908 map\nreflects some development in the Topanga Canyon area, such as houses, a tavern, a post\noffice, inns, campsites, a general store, and a school. A tavern with cabins operated in\n1908 on Chaney’s Road, east of Greenleaf Road. Automobiles were photographed at the\nTopanga General Store in the 1920s. Photographs show the evolution of the area’s\ndevelopment starting with mail delivery in 1880, although plaintiffs’ expert Stanley\nadmitted “it [the photography] doesn’t prove anything.” No development is depicted\nalong the “Ridge Trail” in 1908. Instead, all of the development is accessible from other\nroads, including the “Topanga to Calabasas Road,” now called Old Topanga Canyon\nRoad.\n        Pauline Stewart conveyed her Section 1 property to plaintiffs in 1998.6 She\ntestified that Henry Ridge Motorway was both public and private. She stated that the\nroads at issue “have been used for fifty years” and “there wasn’t any question” that\n“those roads had been public property for so long.” Yet, Stewart admitted she did not\npersonally know of anyone driving Gold Stone Road to Henry Ridge Motorway.]]\n                               [[End nonpublished portion]]\n        b. After March 4, 1972\n        When Pauline Stewart, the “matriarch of Henry Ridge,” moved to Henry Ridge\nMotorway in 1977, it was merely a “fire road.” In 1984, the Los Angeles County Fire\nDepartment notified Stewart that it would no longer maintain the road because the\n“County had designated it as a private road.” (Italics added.) Stewart described Henry\nRidge in a 1988 letter as “a road on private property so it is considered a private road, it\n\n\n6\n       Aged 91 at the time of trial, Stewart was unavailable to testify and so her\ndeposition was read into the record.\n\n                                             13\n\fis not a public thoroughfare, even though it is open to the public for all practical\npurposes.” (Italics added.)\n       Stewart’s own travel on Henry Ridge Motorway was almost exclusively\nnorthbound from plaintiffs’ property and not southerly through defendants’ land. The\nonly roads that were continuously used for access to and from plaintiffs’ property were\nAdamsville and Alta to the north. Stewart used Gold Stone Road twice in 20 years. She\nhad no personal knowledge of anyone using Gold Stone Road to Henry Ridge Motorway;\nshe did not even know whether her husband used Gold Stone Road. Nor did Stewart\nknow whether any property owners on Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone Road\ndedicated those roads to public use. She was unaware of facts that would show that the\ngeneral public had used Henry Ridge Motorway to Gold Stone Road to Greenleaf\nCanyon on a regular basis. She stated, “I don’t know anybody in their right mind that\nwould even try to go that way.” (Italics added.)\n       Plaintiffs called a series of witnesses who described their use of Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road. These witnesses, including plaintiffs, their neighbors,\ndefendants, friends, handymen, tenants, and others in the area, also described who they\nsaw driving along the two roads. None of the witnesses described use of or activity on the\ntwo roads before March 4, 1972.\n       Plaintiffs purchased their Section 1 property in 1998. They have an easement,\nrecorded in 1948, giving them access northerly along “that certain road only, now known\nas a fire road and connected with proposed Mulholland Blvd.” Plaintiffs’ tenants’ leases\nspecify that the tenants may use Henry Ridge Motorway to the north for access but not to\nthe south, except “in case of dire emergency.” Plaintiff Scher testified that since\npurchasing his Section 1 property he intended to establish rights south along Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road.\n       Plaintiffs bought their Section 12 property off of Old Topanga Canyon Road\nin 2007. Undeveloped, plaintiffs’ Section 12 lot measures 1,250 square feet and does not\ntouch Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone Road. Scher testified he bought the\nSection 12 lot “ ‘partially to stick a thorn in my neighbor’s side’ ” and because plaintiffs\n\n                                             14\n\fwanted to claim a right to use the two roads at issue under the Declarations of Easements,\nwhich plaintiffs believed benefitted Section 12 owners, but not plaintiffs’ Section 1\nproperty.\n       Marshall purchased her property in 1987. In 1990, after recording her trail\ndedication and obtaining a Coastal Commission development permit, Marshall began\nconstructing a residence located 24 feet from Henry Ridge Motorway. Marshall posted\nsigns on the northern and southern boundaries of her property declaring “Private Road\npermission to pass subject to control of owner. Penal Code 602 and Section 1008 Civil\nCode.” Marshall hung the signs to prevent people from gaining prescriptive rights on her\nproperty.\n       In 1991, Marshall installed a locked gate across Henry Ridge Motorway on the\nnorthern boundary of her land and later electrified it. Marshall gave gate keys for\nemergencies to the fire department and her neighbors, including Stewart, who passed one\non to plaintiffs when they bought the property. When closed, the gate prevents only\nvehicular access; hikers and equestrians can circumnavigate it.\n       Erickson and Malick, attracted by the quiet and privacy, purchased their north\nparcel in 1996 and their south parcel in 2000. Erickson “religiously” stops drivers on\nGold Stone Road and Henry Ridge Motorway who he does not recognize. Erickson once\nchallenged Scher’s right to use the road on the Erickson/Malick south property. Malick\nhas “often” stopped people on Gold Stone Road because they were following the\nThomas Brothers’ Guide to Henry Ridge Motorway. In 2008, Erickson and Malick\nrecorded two declarations granting consent to use Henry Ridge Motorway on their two\nparcels pursuant to Civil Code section 813.\n       The Schroders have lived on their land since 2005, in part because of the privacy it\nafforded. Their seller and realtor told them there were no ingress and egress easements\non Gold Stone Road. Schroder has been vigilant about keeping drivers off Gold Stone\nRoad. He “always” stops drivers and redirects them unless they are guests of the\nErickson/Malicks. There are two gates across Gold Stone Road.\n\n\n                                              15\n\f       The Burkes bought their Section 7 land in 1993. In 2005, they bought the\nunimproved land now held by the A.S.A. Trust to prevent development and ensure\nprivacy. There is a sign at the intersection of Greenleaf Canyon Road and Gold Stone\nRoad declaring the latter to be “Private.” Another sign reads, “ ‘No access to\nHenry Ridge Road. Locked gates ahead.’ ” On a wooden gate at the junction of\nGold Stone Road, Greenleaf Canyon, and the Burkes’ driveway stands a sign since at\nleast 1993 that forbids trespassing, parking, dumping, and loitering. The Burkes posted\nthe signs pursuant to Civil Code section 1008 so that people would know they were\npermissively driving on Gold Stone Road. Since they moved into their Section 7\nproperty, the Burkes have stopped passersby to re-direct those not entitled to use Gold\nStone Road.\n       5. Alternative routes\n       Plaintiffs calculate that traveling Henry Ridge Motorway south to Gold Stone\nRoad is more convenient because this route to Topanga center takes 7 to 10 minutes.\nThere are numerous roads connecting to Henry Ridge Motorway in the north to Topanga\ncenter, but those routes take plaintiffs 18 to 20 minutes. Plaintiffs claim they are unable\nto use Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road to evacuate to the south in case of\nemergency.\n       In 2005, plaintiffs discovered that the lock on Marshall’s gate was jammed.\nPlaintiffs sent Marshall letters demanding a new key and claiming an express easement to\nuse Henry Ridge Motorway. Plaintiffs also sent letters to Erickson/Malick and discussed\nthe issue of access to the two roads with Schroder. People consulted with their title\ninsurers.\n       6. The litigation\n       Plaintiffs filed their complaint alleging that defendants’ properties are burdened,\nand plaintiffs are benefitted, by express easements for ingress and egress along Henry\nRidge Motorway and Gold Stone Road. The complaint sought to quiet title to the\neasements and sought declarations that: (1) plaintiffs are the beneficial owners of\nexpress, prescriptive, and equitable easements to use Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold\n\n                                             16\n\fStone Road; (2) defendants have acquiesced to the dedication to public use of the entirety\nof Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road across defendants’ properties; and\n(3) plaintiffs are entitled to use Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road as a public\nstreet. The complaint also sought to enjoin defendants from interfering with plaintiffs’\nuse of the two roads. After trial, plaintiffs amended their complaint according to proof to\nadd a cause of action for implied easement.\n                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n       [[The trial court issued a 19-page statement of decision finding: (1) plaintiffs had\nan implied easement for vehicular ingress and egress that arose before the federal\nGovernment conveyed the land by patents in 1902; (2) Henry Ridge Motorway and a\nportion of Gold Stone Road at Greenleaf Canyon Road were dedicated to the public when\nthe land was still owned by the United States Government; (3) the public has vested\nrights to use the roads under the doctrines of implied-in-law and implied-in-fact\ndedication; and (4) plaintiffs failed to prove they had an express, prescriptive, or\nequitable easement.]]\n                               [[End nonpublished portion]]\n       The trial court entered judgment declaring that Henry Ridge Motorway and\nGold Stone Road had been impliedly dedicated as public streets and quieting title to\neasements over the two roads in favor of plaintiffs.

The court also entered judgment\nagainst plaintiffs on their theories of express, prescriptive, and equitable easement.\nDefendants appeal and plaintiffs appeal.\n                                     CONTENTIONS\n       Defendants’ appeals challenge the portions of the judgment against them and\nplaintiffs’ appeal challenges the portion of the judgment against them.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f                                      DISCUSSION\n                                              I\n                                DEFENDANTS’ APPEAL\n                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n                      [[Implied Easement Based On Federal Patents\n       1. The elements of implied easements\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the\nfederal patents created an implied easement over Henry Ridge Motorway because the\ncommon ownership element was lacking.7 The trial court found the evidence “manifest”\nthat Henry Ridge Motorway existed and was used before the first division of title in 1902\nwhen the federal government issued the first patent.\n       The law will imply an intent to create an easement by grant or reservation in the\nabsence of a written document evincing intent. (6 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate\n(3d ed. 2011) § 15:19, p. 15-18.) Easements will be implied if the following conditions\nexist at the time of the conveyance: “1) the owner of property conveys or transfers a\nportion of that property to another; 2) the owner’s prior existing use of the property was\nof a nature that the parties must have intended or believed that the use would continue;\nmeaning that the existing use must either have been known to the grantor and the grantee,\nor have been so obviously and apparently permanent that the parties should have known\nof the use; and 3) the easement is reasonably necessary to the use and benefit of the\nquasi-dominant tenement.” (Tusher v.

To the extent\nthat the statement of decision could be read as having declared an implied easement over\na portion of Gold Stone Road, our holding as it relates to the ruling concerning an\nimplied easement for access on Henry Ridge Motorway likewise applies to Gold Stone\nRoad.\n\n                                             18\n\ffn. omitted (Tusher); see also Civ. Code, § 1104;8 12 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law\n(10th ed. 2005) Real Property § 392, p. 460.)\n       The grantee is said to have a grant of a right of way when an access easement by\nimplication benefits the conveyed parcel. Conversely, the grantor has impliedly reserved\nan access easement across the grantee’s property when the easement by implication is\nretained for the benefit of the grantor’s parcel. (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 163.)\n       “ ‘ “The law does not favor the implication of easements. Such implication can\nonly be made in connection with a conveyance, and in view of the rule that a conveyance\nis to be construed against the grantor . . . .

Thus, an easement by implication will only be found when\nthere is “clear evidence” that the parties intended it “at the time of the original transfer of\nthe property” by the common grantor. (Tusher, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 143, italics\nadded; Thorstrom, supra, at p. 1420; Fristoe v.

The trial court’s factual findings\nare binding on the appellate court if supported by substantial evidence. (6 Miller & Starr,\nCal. Real Estate, supra, § 15:19, p. 15-82, citing Tusher, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at\np. 145.) However, whether common ownership may be established by reference to\n\n\n\n8\n        Civil Code section 1104 reads: “A transfer of real property passes all easements\nattached thereto, and creates in favor thereof an easement to use other real property of the\nperson whose estate is transferred in the same manner and to the same extent as such\nproperty was obviously and permanently used by the person whose estate is transferred,\nfor the benefit thereof, at the time when the transfer was agreed upon or completed.”\n\n                                              19\n\ffederal patents presents a legal question which we review de novo. (Kellogg v. Garcia\n(2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2246196\"><a href=\"/opinion/2246196/kellogg-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802-803.)\n       2. Common ownership is lacking.\n       The first required element is that the dominant and servient tenements were held\nby the same owner at the time of the conveyance giving rise to the implied easement.\n(Tusher, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 141.) The United States Government can be the\ncommon owner of land conveyed by a federal patent. (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at\np. 161.) However, “conveyances involving a sovereign as a common owner typically do\nnot give rise to implied reservations of easements.” (Id. at p. 165.)\n       In Murphy, the plaintiff seeking to establish an implied access easement by\nnecessity argued that the relevant conveyance was the first one in 1929, when the federal\ngovernment deeded the parcel containing the defendants’ servient property, reasoning the\ngovernment impliedly retained ownership of plaintiff’s dominant land and hence\nimpliedly reserved an access easement for itself. (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at pp. 167-\n168.) Conversely, the defendants fighting the easement across their land asserted that\ncommon ownership could not be established because the relevant conveyance was the\nlater 1932 patent deeding the plaintiff’s dominant tenement, by which time the\ngovernment no longer owned the servient property. (Id. at p. 168.) The Supreme Court\nin Murphy stated, “We agree that an easement by necessity cannot arise by implication\nfrom the 1932 conveyance because common ownership was lacking.” (Ibid.) Thus, the\nconveyance giving rise to the reservation of an easement by implication is the one\ntransferring the dominant tenement.\n       Here, just as in Murphy, the relevant conveyance is the patent to plaintiffs’\nSection 1 ancestor because plaintiffs seek to establish their right, as the dominant\ntenement holders, to use Henry Ridge Motorway as it crosses defendants’ servient\nproperties. However, plaintiffs’ property was patented in 1907, by which time the\nnortherly Erickson/Malick property had already been conveyed by patent in 1902 and the\nSchroder and southerly Erickson/Malick property had already been conveyed in 1903.\nThus, no easement can arise by implication because by the time the federal government\n\n                                             20\n\fissued the patent to plaintiffs’ predecessor in 1907, the United States no longer owned\nany of these servient tenements. (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 168.) The common\nownership element is missing.\n       Plaintiffs point out that Murphy concerned an easement by necessity, not at issue\nhere. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court’s holding still applies. Common ownership is an\nelement of both implied easements in general and implied easements by necessity.\n(Compare Tusher, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 141 & Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at\np. 167.) If the Murphy court declined to find an implied easement even though necessity\nmay have justified it, then certainly no easement should be inferred here where necessity\nis not even claimed.\n       We are mindful of the fact that the patent to Marshall’s predecessor in 1911 is\nlater than the patent to plaintiffs’ Section 1 land. Thus, the federal government was the\ncommon owner of Marshall’s and plaintiffs’ land at the time of relevant conveyance.\nHowever, even if plaintiffs might have an implied easement across Marshall’s property,\nthat is the extent of their right. Stated otherwise, plaintiffs’ implied easement for access\nwould end at the boundaries of Marshall’s land, and plaintiffs could travel no farther\nsouth without encroaching on the lands of Erickson/Malick and Schroder. We decline to\notherwise imply an access easement by necessity over Marshall’s property as there is no\nshowing of strict necessity. Plaintiffs’ land is by no means landlocked. (See, e.g.,\nMurphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 164.)\n       3. Plaintiffs produced no evidence that the federal government intended to reserve\nan access easement when it issued its patents.\n       Common ownership aside, the trial court erred in finding an easement by\nimplication across Marshall’s or any other defendant’s parcel because there is no clear\nevidence that the federal government intended to reserve an easement for access. The\nparties dispute whether the record shows the government’s intent to reserve an access\neasement. They focus on the use element of the cause of action. Plaintiffs argue the\nhomesteaders’ use is sufficient evidence; defendants counter that our focus should be on\nthe government’s actions. Again, Murphy controls.\n\n                                             21\n\f       The purpose of the doctrine of implied easements is to give effect to the actual\nintent of the parties based on all of the facts and circumstances. (Thorstrom, supra,\n196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420.) However, courts must be particularly vigilant “when\ncommon ownership is traced back to a federal grant made without an express reservation\nfor access.” (Murphy, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 161.) “[C]onveyances involving a\nsovereign as the common owner typically do not give rise to implied reservations of\neasements or other property interests in conveyed land. [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 165,\nitalics added.) “[T]he distinctive nature and history of federal land grants and the\ngovernment’s power of eminent domain” have made courts reluctant “to interfere with\nthe certainty and predictability of land titles conferred by a sovereign without any express\nreservation of rights. [Citations.]” (Id. at pp. 161, 165, italics added.) Therefore, our\nSupreme Court instructs that “extreme caution must be exercised in determining whether\nthe circumstances surrounding a government land grant are sufficient to overcome the\ninference prompted by the omission of an express reference to a reserved right of access.\n[Citation.]” (Id. at p. 167, italics added.) “[W]hen a claimant traces common ownership\nback to the federal government and seeks to establish an implied reservation of an access\nright-of-way, the intent of Congress is paramount” and the “easement claimant bears the\nburden of producing evidence on the issues regarding the government’s intent to reserve\nan easement and the government’s lack of power to condemn.” (Ibid., italics added.)\n       The patents here were issued pursuant to the federal Homestead Act. “The\npertinent inquiry . . . is the intent of Congress when it granted land.” (Leo Sheep Co. v.\nUnited States (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110046\"><a href=\"/opinion/110046/leo-sheep-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681 [involving Union Pacific Railroad Charter Act\nof 1862, Act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 489].) Plaintiffs have not pointed us to anywhere in\nthe Homestead Act or its legislative history that mentions reservations of access\neasements.\n       The patents likewise are silent about access easements, as plaintiffs acknowledge.\nNormally, federal patents contain no express reservation of easements for access.\n(Leo Sheep Co. v. United States, supra, 440 U.S. at p. 687 [“Generations of land patents\nhave issued without any express reservation of the right” for an access easement].) Here,\n\n                                             22\n\feach patent explicitly “reserve[s] from the lands hereby granted a right of way thereon for\nditches or canals constructed by the authority of the United States.” (Italics added.)\n“Given the existence of such explicit exceptions, this [Supreme] Court has in the past\nrefused to add to this list by divining some ‘implicit’ congressional intent.” (Leo Sheep\nCo. v. United States, at p. 679.) The omission from the patents in this case of a\nreservation of a right-of-way for access compels the conclusion that the federal\ngovernment had no intent to reserve an access easement on any trail or road that existed\nalong Henry Ridge.

(Id. at pp. 132-133.) Horowitz is inapplicable because the litigants there were\nprivate parties. Where, as here, the common owner is the sovereign whose patents did\nnot expressly reserve access easements, the burden fell on plaintiffs as easement\nclaimants to produce evidence about the government’s intent. (Murphy, supra,\n46 Cal.4th at p. 167.) Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden to adduce any evidence, let\nalone clear evidence, that Congress intended to reserve an access road in these patents.\n       The trial court’s finding of an implied easement over Henry Ridge Motorway\nbased on the federal patents resulted from its misapplication of the law with respect to\ncommon ownership, and plaintiffs adduced no “clear evidence” of Congressional intent\nto reserve an access easement. Thus, the portion of the judgment establishing an implied\neasement must be reversed.\n       We turn to the trial court’s three bases for finding the roads were dedicated to\npublic use: (1) the patent theory, and (2) implied in law and (3) implied in fact\ndedication.]]\n                               [[End nonpublished portion]]\n\n\n                                              23\n\f                                 Dedication To Public Use\n       Defendants challenge the trial court’s interpretation and application of Civil Code\nsection 1009 in ruling that the two roads were dedicated to public use.\n       1. The law of public dedication\n       A dedication is the voluntary application of land “ ‘for some public use, made by\nthe fee owner, and accepted by the public. By virtue of this offer which the fee owner\nhas made, he is precluded from reasserting an exclusive right over the land now used for\npublic purposes.’ ” (Friends of the Trails v. Blasius (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274332/friends-of-the-trails-v-blasius/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

[Citation.]” (Blasius, at\np. 820.)\n       Common law dedications are either express or implied. Express dedication occurs\nwhen the landowner’s intent to dedicate is manifested by overt acts, such as by an\ninstrument. Implied dedication arises when, in the absence of overt acts, the evidence of\nthe landowner’s conduct or acquiescence supports the attribution of intent to dedicate.\n(Blasius, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 821.)\n       Dedications can be implied in law and implied in fact. A dedication is implied in\nlaw when the public’s use is adverse and exceeds the period for prescription. (Blasius,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 821; Cherokee Valley Farms, Inc. v. Summerville Elementary\nSch. Dist.

A dedication is implied in fact\n“when the period of public use is less than the period for prescription and the acts or\nomissions of the owner afford an implication of actual consent or acquiescence to\ndedication.” (Blasius, at p. 821, citing Union Transp. Co. v. Sacramento County (1954)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 241.)\n       In addition to an offer to dedicate, the record must show an acceptance by the\npublic. (10 Miller & Starr, supra, § 26:1, p. 26-5; Baldwin v. City of Los Angeles (1999)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

An express acceptance is a formal acceptance by the proper authorities. Implied\nacceptance occurs when “ ‘the public has made use of the property for a period of time\n\n                                              24\n\fwhich demonstrates an intention to accept dedication [citation] or where actions by the\nresponsible public officials indicate[ ] an assumption of control over the property.’\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.) Courts require an “unconditional and unqualified acceptance of the\noffer” to dedicate. (10 Miller & Starr, supra, § 26:1, p. 26-5.)\n       The evidence required for finding that a road was impliedly dedicated to public\nuse was delineated in Gion v. City of Santa Cruz (1970) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1176119\"><a href=\"/opinion/1176119/gion-v-city-of-santa-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Gion). Under Gion,\n“[w]hat must be shown is that persons used the property believing the public had a right\nto such use. This public use may not be ‘adverse’ to the interests of the owner in the\nsense that the word is used in adverse possession cases. If a trial court finds that the\npublic has used land without objection or interference for more than five years, it need\nnot make a separate finding of ‘adversity’ to support a decision of implied dedication.”\n(Id. at p. 39.)\n       As for the type of use, those advocating implied public dedication must\ndemonstrate that people have “used the land as they would have used public land.”\n(Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 39.) Proponents of implied public dedication must show that\n“various groups” of people “have used the land,” not merely “a limited and definable\nnumber of persons.” (Ibid.) “ ‘[T]he thing of significance is that whoever wanted to use\n[the land] did so . . . when they wished to do so without asking permission and without\nprotest from the land owners.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 40.) Therefore, the use must be\n“substantial, diverse, and sufficient, considering all the circumstances, to convey to the\nowner notice that the public is using the passage as if it had a right so to do.” (Blasius,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 826, fn. 7.)\n       Whether there has been a dedication for public use is a factual question.\n(10 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate, supra, § 26:4, p. 26-11; Cherokee, supra,\n30 Cal.App.3d at p. 585.) Whether express or implied, “the fundamental requirement for\ndedication is the clear and unequivocal intent by the property owner to dedicate his or\nher property [for] public use” (10 Miller & Starr, supra, at p. 26-9) and the unconditional\nand unqualified acceptance of that offer. (Id., § 26:1, p. 26-5.)\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       2. Civil Code section 1009 prevents all public use after 1972, not just recreational\nuse, from ripening into an implied dedication to public use, and thus the trial court’s\ninterpretation and application of that statute was legal error.\n       On the heels of Gion, the Legislature enacted Civil Code section 1009, effective\nMarch 4, 1972 to prospectively abrogate that decision. (Blasius, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 822-823.)9 Subdivision (a) of section 1009 is a statement of the Legislature’s\nfindings that “[i]t is in the best interests of the state to encourage owners of private real\nproperty to continue to make their lands available for public recreational use;” that\nlandowners face the “threat of loss of rights in their property if they allow . . . the public\nto use, enjoy or pass over their property for recreational purposes;” and that the “stability\nand marketability of record titles is clouded by such public use, thereby compelling the\nowner to exclude the public from his property.” (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (a).)\n       Subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1009 declares that, notwithstanding lack of\nCivil Code sections 813 and 1008 notices [that use is permissive] by “a private owner of\nreal property,” “no use of such property by the public after the effective date of this\nsection shall ever ripen to confer upon the public or any governmental body or unit a\nvested right to continue to make such use permanently, in the absence of an express\nwritten irrevocable offer of dedication of such property to such use, made by the owner\nthereof in the manner prescribed in subdivision (c) of this section, which has been\naccepted by the county, city, or other public body to which the offer of dedication was\nmade . . . .” (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (b), italics added.)10\n\n\n9\n      The Legislature also amended Civil Code section 813. (Blasius, supra, 78\nCal.App.4th at p. 822.) That statute now provides that a recorded notice of the\nlandowner’s consent to public use for a described purpose constitutes conclusive\nevidence that subsequent use of the land is permissive. (See Blasius, at pp. 822-823.)\n10\n         Civil Code section 1009 reads in relevant part, “(a) The Legislature finds that: [¶]\n(1) It is in the best interests of the state to encourage owners of private real property to\ncontinue to make their lands available for public recreational use to supplement\nopportunities available on tax-supported publicly owned facilities. [¶] (2) Owners of\nprivate real property are confronted with the threat of loss of rights in their property if\n                                              26\n\f       Subdivision (e) exempts coastal property, not at issue here, from subdivision (b).\nSubdivision (f) sets forth the steps that a coastal landowner may take to prevent the\npublic use of coastal property from being used as evidence to support an implied\n\nthey allow or continue to allow members of the public to use, enjoy or pass over their\nproperty for recreational purposes. [¶] (3) The stability and marketability of record titles\nis clouded by such public use, thereby compelling the owner to exclude the public from\nhis property.\n        “(b) Regardless of whether or not a private owner of real property has recorded a\nnotice of consent to use of any particular property pursuant to Section 813 of the Civil\nCode or has posted signs on such property pursuant to Section 1008 of the Civil Code,\nexcept as otherwise provided in subdivision (d), no use of such property by the public\nafter the effective date of this section shall ever ripen to confer upon the public or any\ngovernmental body or unit a vested right to continue to make such use permanently, in\nthe absence of an express written irrevocable offer of dedication of such property to such\nuse, made by the owner thereof in the manner prescribed in subdivision (c) of this\nsection, which has been accepted by the county, city, or other public body to which the\noffer of dedication was made, in the manner set forth in subdivision (c). [¶] . . . [¶]\n        “(e) Subdivision (b) shall not apply to any coastal property which lies within 1,000\nyards inland of the mean high tide line of the Pacific Ocean, and harbors, estuaries, bays\nand inlets thereof, but not including any property lying inland of the Carquinez Straits\nbridge, or between the mean high tide line and the nearest public road or highway,\nwhichever distance is less.\n        “(f) No use, subsequent to the effective date of this section, by the public of\nproperty described in subdivision (e) shall constitute evidence or be admissible as\nevidence that the public or any governmental body or unit has any right in such property\nby implied dedication if the owner does any of the following actions: [¶] (1) Posts signs,\nas provided in Section 1008, and renews the same, if they are removed, at least once a\nyear, or publishes annually . . . in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or\ncounties in which the land is located, a statement describing the property and reading\nsubstantially as follows: ‘Right to pass by permission and subject to control of owner:\nSection 1008, Civil Code.’ [¶] (2) Records a notice as provided in Section 813. [¶]\n(3) Enters into a written agreement with any federal, state, or local agency providing for\nthe public use of such land. [¶] After taking any of the actions set forth in paragraph\n(1), (2), or (3), and during the time such action is effective, the owner shall not prevent\nany public use which is appropriate under the permission granted pursuant to such\nparagraphs by physical obstruction, notice, or otherwise.\n        “(g) The permission for public use of real property referred to in subdivision (f)\nmay be conditioned upon reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of such\npublic use, and no use in violation of such restrictions shall be considered public use for\npurposes of a finding of implied dedication.”\n\n                                            27\n\fdedication to the public, such as posting signs, recording Civil Code section 813 notices,\nor entering into an agreement with a governmental agency providing for the public use of\nthe land. (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (f)(1)-(3).)\n       Here, the trial court ruled that Civil Code section 1009 prevents only recreational\nuse of property from developing into a permanent vested right. Based on its statutory\ninterpretation, the court relied on evidence of public vehicular ingress and egress after\nMarch 4, 1972 to find that Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road were impliedly\ndedicated as public streets. Defendants contend that the trial court erred as a matter of\nlaw. They read Civil Code section 1009, subdivision (b) to preclude all use, not simply\nrecreational use, of private property from ever ripening into public dedications by\nimplication after the statute’s enactment.\n       What Civil Code section 1009 precludes is an issue of statutory construction.\n“Statutory construction is a question of law that courts review de novo. [Citation.] The\njudicial task in construing a statute is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent . . . .\n[Citations.] The words of the statute are given their ordinary and usual meaning and are\nconstrued in the context of the statute as a whole and the entire system of law of which it\nis a part.

Subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1009 bars all public use, not just\nrecreational use, from developing into an implied public dedication. Subdivision (b)\nbroadly declares that “no use” – not “no recreational use” – shall “ever” ripen into a\nvested right in the public, absent a written offer. “ ‘[W]hen one part of a statute contains\na term or provision, the omission of that term or provision from another part of the statute\nindicates the Legislature intended to convey a different meaning.’ [Citations.]” (Klein v.\nUnited States of America (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630961\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630961/klein-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80.) The absence of the word\n“recreational” from the phrase “no use” in subdivision (b) indicates that the Legislature’s\naim was to comprehensively preclude implied public dedications from arising from any\nkind of public use of private real property.\n       Pulido v. Pereira (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, concluded otherwise. Pulido\nstated that “use of such property” in subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1009 “refers\nback to subdivision (a)(1), which explains that the subject of the statute is the public\nrecreational use of private real property.” However, subdivision (b) of Civil Code section\n1009 defines the property to which it refers. The first clause of subdivision (b) reads\n“Regardless of whether or not a private owner of real property has recorded a notice of\nconsent to use of any particular property pursuant to Section 813 of the Civil Code or has\nposted signs on such property pursuant to Section 1008 of the Civil Code . . . .” (Italics\nadded.) The second clause of the same sentence declares, “no use of such\nproperty . . . shall ever ripen to confer” a vested right in the public by implication.\n(Italics added.) Reference back to subdivision (a) to define the type of property discussed\nin subdivision (b) is unnecessary because the operative sentence of subdivision (b)\ncontains its own definition, namely “any particular” private property.\n       Indeed, nowhere in the operative provisions of the statute is the word\n“recreational” found; “recreational” is only employed in the legislative findings in\nsubdivision (a) of Civil Code section 1009. “Legislative findings and statements of\npurpose in a statute’s preamble can be illuminating if a statute is ambiguous. [Citation.]\nBut a preamble is not binding in the interpretation of the statute.” (Yeager v. Blue Cross\n\n                                               29\n\fof California (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2245979\"><a href=\"/opinion/2245979/yeager-v-blue-cross-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1103, fn. omitted.) As noted, no ambiguity\nexists in the statute and so it is unnecessary to import the word “recreational” from the\nlegislative findings into the operative portions of the statute when the Legislature has\ndeclined to do so. The Legislature clearly intended Civil Code section 1009 to have\nbroader application than solely to recreational use.11\n       Viewing the statute as a whole (Bostick v. Flex Equipment Co., Inc., supra,\n147 Cal.App.4th at p. 107 (conc. opn. of Croskey, J.)), reinforces our conclusion.\nSubdivisions (e) and (f) of Civil Code section 1009 treat coastal property differently than\nnon-coastal land by exempting coastal property from the subdivision (b) comprehensive\nban on implied dedication. Coastal land remains subject to the implied dedication\ndoctrine. To prevent evidence of public use of coastal land from supporting a finding of\nimplied public dedication, an owner must affirmatively act by taking one of the three\nsteps listed in subdivision (f). “[C]ourts must strive to give meaning to every word in a\nstatute and to avoid constructions that render words, phrases, or clauses superfluous.\n[Citations.]” (Klein v. United States of America, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 80.) A\nconstruction of subdivision (b) to ban only recreational use from ripening into a\npermanent vested public right would eliminate the statute’s disparate treatment of coastal\nand non-coastal land.\n\n\n\n\n11\n        We disagree with the dicta to the contrary in Bustillos v. Murphy (2002)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2246984\"><a href=\"/opinion/2246984/bustillos-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

After reciting the legislative intent to encourage recreational use in\nCivil Code section 1009, subdivision (a), Bustillos stated, “The statute effectuates this\npurpose by providing that no recreational use of private property ‘shall ever ripen to\nconfer upon the public . . . a vested right to continue to make such use permanently’\nunless the property owner dedicates the land to public use and the dedication of property\nis accepted by the government. (Id., subd. (b).)” (Bustillos v. Murphy, at pp. 1280-1281,\nitalics added.) Bustillos inserted the word “recreational” into its reading of\nsubdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1009 where that word does not actually exist in\ncontravention of the rule that “[w]e may not make a silent statute speak by inserting\nlanguage the Legislature did not put in the legislation.

Looking then to the Legislature’s intent, it reinforces our construction.\nThe Supreme Court in Gion clarified well-settled principles of implied dedication to the\npublic for recreational purposes in a coastal area.

With the passage of section 1009, the Legislature adjusted the\neffect of Gion on land along the coast, and precluded all post-1972 public use of\nnon-coastal private property from ripening into public dedication by implication. (See\nCiv. Code, § 1009, subds. (b) & (e).) The Legislature expressly designed Civil Code\nsection 1009 to “treat the effect of implied dedication differently in the coastal zone than\nin the remainder of the state.” (Assem. Com. on Planning and Land Use, Analysis of\nProposed Amendments to Sen. Bill No. 504, (1971 Reg. Sess.) July 20, 1971, p. 1, italics\nadded.)12 With passage of section 1009, “[t]he doctrine of implied dedication would be\ndeleted prospectively except for the ‘coastal zone’ . . . .” (Ibid., italics added.) More\nimportant, the statute was written to “[p]rohibit[] any use of private land, except specified\nocean frontage land, after [the] effective date of [the] act from conferring a vested right in\n[the] public . . . in [the] absence of [an] express written irrevocable offer [to dedicate\nmade] by owner of [the] property accepted by specified public agenc[ies].

(Civ.\nCode, § 1009, subd. (a).) To read subdivision (b) to apply only to recreational use would\ndiscourage non-coastal landowners, unable to distinguish between recreational and\nnonrecreational users, from allowing any entry on their inland property for fear that “non-\nrecreational” use would become permanent. Such a result would improperly thwart the\nstatute’s declared purpose and return the law to the state it was under Gion, thus defeating\nthe Legislature’s motive for enacting the statute.\n        The trial court followed Hanshaw v.

Hanshaw rejected the landowner’s argument that Civil Code section 1009\nprevented application of a common law public dedication theory after 1972 in a case\ninvolving implied public dedication of an access road. Relying on the phrase “for\nrecreational purposes” in the subdivision (a)(2) legislative findings, the Hanshaw court\nheld that the statute applies only to preclude the ripening of recreational use into a public\n\n                                              32\n\fdedication. (Hanshaw, at pp. 484-485.) We decline to follow Hanshaw because it\nignored the interplay of all of the statute’s subdivisions and limited subdivision (b)’s\nbroad prohibition that “no use” “shall ever ripen to confer upon the public” a vested right\nto continue the use.

Under Civil\nCode section 1009, subdivision (b), none of the testimony is admissible as all of it\nconcerned vehicular use of Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road between the\nlate 1970s and the first decade of the 21st century. No witness testified about using or\nseeing anyone else use these roads for vehicular access before March 1972. Even the\nMatriarch of Henry Ridge, Stewart, only moved to Henry Ridge Motorway in 1977.\nAlthough Stewart testified that the roads “have been used for fifty years,” this testimony\ndoes not begin to describe the number and variety of use that Gion and Blasius require to\nfind an implied dedication to public use. (Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at pp. 39-40; Blasius,\nsupra, 78 Cal.App.4th at pp. 825-826, fn. 7.) Also, Stewart admitted that she had no\npersonal knowledge of anyone driving Gold Stone Road to Henry Ridge Motorway.\n\n\n\n13\n       The Los Angeles County Fire Department’s maintenance of the road until 1984 is\nnot admissible evidence of acceptance by the County of a dedication to public use. (Civ.\nCode, § 1009, subd. (b).) Not only does the record lack evidence of an express, written,\nirrevocable offer to the County, but the County ceased maintaining Henry Ridge\nMotorway because it was a private road.\n\n                                             33\n\f       The trial court additionally cited the express irrevocable offers to dedicate trail\neasements, which were executed after 1972, as evidence that Marshall, and the\npredecessors of the Schroders and Erickson/Malicks impliedly devoted these two roads to\nthe public as vehicular thoroughfares. An exception to the ban on post-1972 implied\ndedications occurs when the landowner records an express, written, and irrevocable offer\nto dedicate that is accepted by a governmental entity. (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (b).) We\nindependently construe these instruments which were executed after 1972. (City of\nManhattan Beach v.

The latter dedication was also limited\nto daylight hours. Nothing could be more manifest: Marshall and the predecessors of the\nSchroders and Erickson/Malicks made irrevocable offers to dedicate easements for trail\npurposes only; there is nothing in the trail dedications indicating the intent to devote the\nportions of the trail on their property that coincides with Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold\nStone Road as public streets. The express dedication of property for public use for horses\nand pedestrians alone does not result in implied dedications of the same land as a street\nfor cars. (California etc. Co. v.

Thus, these instruments do not\ndedicate public roads for the unlimited vehicular access at anytime of the day and night\nthat plaintiffs seek.\n       Nor is the witness testimony about vehicular ingress and egress for general\npurposes after 1972 admissible to transform the express offer of a trail for public use into\na dedication of the roads as public streets. (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (b).) The Coastal\nCommission reports attached to the trail dedications require no more than public access\nfor recreational purposes. The reports cite Public Resources Code sections 30210\nthrough 30212, which concern access to the sea for recreational purposes and the findings\nare replete with references to public access to the Topanga-Henry Ridge Trail. More\n\n                                             34\n\fimportant, the reports reflect a concern about the “perception by the public that the areas\ninvolved are private” and a “ ‘feeling of trespass,’ ” contradicting the requirement of\nGion that people must use the roads “believing the public had a right to such use.”\n(Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 39.)\n       Finally, the trial court ruled that defendants’ acts of erecting gates and posting\nsigns were in response to the “continued heavy use of Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold\nStone Road by the public.” While that may be, no use of private inland property may\nripen into a permanent, vested, public right after 1972 “[r]egardless of whether or not a\nprivate owner of real property has recorded a notice of consent . . . pursuant to Section\n813 of the Civil Code or has posted signs on such property pursuant to Section 1008 of\nthe Civil Code.” (Civ. Code, § 1009, subd. (b).)\n       The trial court erred in relying on post-1972 evidence of public use, and the record\ncontains no express, written, irrevocable offer to dedicate the subject roads as public\nthoroughfares.\n                              [[Begin nonpublished portion]]\n       [[Turning to pre-1972 use, as explained, the photographs that predate 1972 show\nthat the Topanga area was developing, but none shows development along Henry Ridge\nMotorway. Rather, all of the sites depicted on the maps from before 1972 are connected\nto roads other than Henry Ridge Motorway. Thus, these photographs do not give rise to a\nreasonable inference that the road was used during those years.\n       The trial court also cited the 1949 Easement, as well as the 1968 and 1970\nDeclarations as constituting offers to “dedicate these streets or other areas for public use”\nbecause these instruments used the word “dedicate” or evinced an intent to dedicate.

[Citation.] It is highly unlikely [the grantor]\nwould have used the word in the . . . deed had he not intended the road to be a public\nroad.” (Id. at p. 282.)\n       However, resolution of this issue requires construction of the documents, and the\ninterpretation of deeds and other instruments is solely a judicial function unless the\n\n                                             35\n\finterpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence. (City of Manhattan Beach v.\nSuperior Court, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 238.) Upon inspection, none of the instruments\ncited by the trial court effectuated a dedication of Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone\nRoad to the public, their use of the word “dedication” in the titles notwithstanding.\nAlthough the grantors desired to subdivide and to provide the new parcels with access to\na public street, each of the documents explicitly declared “appurtenant” “easements for\nroad purposes” with the proviso that if final tract maps were recorded dedicating public\nstreets, or in the case of the 1949 Easement the state or county accepted it as a public\nroad, then the easements would no longer be effective. When a dedication is conditional,\nthe conditions precedent must occur or the offer is inoperative. (Cal. Water & Tel. Co. v.\nPublic Util. Com. (1959) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377006\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377006/cal-water-tel-co-v-public-util-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495.) The conditions in these instruments were\nnever satisfied: the “said map[s]” attached to the 1968 and 1970 Declarations are not\nfinal tract maps;14 no acceptance was recorded for any of these instruments; and no\ntestimony was introduced about public use before 1972 such as would constitute implied\nacceptance. Thus, neither the 1949 Easement, the 1968 Declaration, nor the 1970\nDeclarations constitutes a dedication of Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road to\nuse as public streets.\n       The trial court also found that the quad maps showed the two subject roads\nexisting in the same place they do today, and ruled that the roads’ very existence evinced\nan intent to dedicate them to the public. However, “the mere fact that a public map\nshows land to be laid out as a street is not evidence, in itself, of the owner’s dedication of\nthe land.” (26 Cal.Jur.3d, supra, § 73, p. 307.) The simple placement on a map cannot\nconstitute a dedication as a public road or there would be no private roads. Thus, if\npublic dedication is claimed based on recorded maps, the evidence must show the\n\n\n14\n       The trial court was influenced by the legend on the maps attached to two of the\n1970 Declarations which identified a line as indicating “Dedicated roads per attached\ndeclaration.” Such a legend does not create a dedication to public use where the express\nconditions for the dedication were never satisfied. (Cal. Water & Tel. Co. v. Public Util.\nCom., supra, 51 Cal.2d at p. 495.)\n\n                                              36\n\flandowner’s clear and unequivocal intent to so dedicate. (Ibid.) We are mindful that “it\nis not a trivial thing to hold that private property has been dedicated to public use.\n[Citations.]” (Hays v. Vanek, supra, 217 Cal.App.3d at p. 281.) There is no evidence\nthat the roads identified on the quad maps were actually adversely used by, or accepted\nby, the public according to Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at page 39. Under the circumstances,\nnone of the instruments or maps cited by the trial court constitutes “clear and unequivocal\nproof” of an implied in law dedication of Henry Ridge Motorway or Gold Stone Road to\nthe public.\n       3. There is no evidence to support the trial court’s dedication theory based on the\npatents.\n       The trial court ruled that Henry Ridge Motorway and the portion of Gold Stone\nRoad that lies on the Burkes’ property where it connects with Greenleaf Canyon Road\nwere dedicated to public use before 1902, the date of the first patent, while the land was\nstill held by the federal government. For this finding, the court relied on section 2477,\nUnited States Revised Statutes, title 43 United States Code former section 932 (July 26,\n1866), 14 Stat. 2521, repealed by Pub.L. No. 94-579 (Oct. 21, 1976), 90 Stat. 2793\n(RS 2477). Defendants contend this finding was error.\n       Enacted in 1866, RS 2477 read, “ ‘The right of way for the construction of\nhighways over public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted.’ ” (Ball v.\nStephens (1945) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2609502\"><a href=\"/opinion/2609502/ball-v-stephens/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

County of Yuba (2002)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260464\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260464/western-aggregates-inc-v-county-of-yuba/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Under RS 2477, if a public road\nexisted on the date the homesteader took title, the patented land was taken subject to that\nroad. (See Ball, supra, at p. 850.)\n       To determine whether an existing road was public, RS 2477 referred to applicable\nstate law governing dedications. (Western Aggregates, supra, 101 Cal.App.4th at p. 296;\ncf. Ball, supra, 68 Cal.App.2d at p. 846 [describing the law of RS 2477 as requiring\n\n                                              37\n\f“evidence of public use of the described route as a roadway”].) In California between\n1883 and 1935, a road was deemed public if built by the government or “dedicated or\nabandoned to the public . . . .” (Ball, at p. 846, quoting from Pol. Code, former § 2618.)\n       RS 2477 constituted the offer of dedication in California. (Western Aggregates,\nsupra, 101 Cal.App.4th at pp. 296, 298.) Acceptance could be implied by the conduct of\nthe public according to California’s law of dedication. (Ibid., citing Ball, supra,\n68 Cal.App.2d at p. 846.) As explained, proof of public use sufficient to constitute\nacceptance for purposes of RS 2477 involves a substantial, diverse use of the land as\npublic land would be used, by “various groups” of people for five years. (Gion, supra,\n2 Cal.3d at pp. 39-40; Blasius, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 826, fn. 7.) The period of\nacceptance by use ended when the homesteader entered the land. (Knapp v.\nAlexander Co. (1915) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167; United States v.

(Ball, supra,\n68 Cal.App.2d at pp. 847-848.) There was also evidence that “many people used the road\n\n15\n         Ball stated that the period of acceptance by use ended when the patent was issued,\ni.e., five years after the homesteader’s entry. (Ball, supra, 68 Cal.App.2d at pp. 847-\n848.) However, defendants convincingly argue that acceptance by use ended when a\nhomesteader entered the land. Once a homesteader entered the land under the\nHomestead Act, the land was no longer public because “entry for purposes of\nhomesteading . . . separated the land from the public domain.” (United States v. Clarke,\nsupra, 529 F.2d at p. 986.) The United States Supreme Court explained that upon entry,\nthe homesteader had a “preferential” or inchoate right to the land and once he fulfilled the\nconditions of the Homestead Act, “and receive[d] a patent vesting in him the complete\nlegal title, this title relates back to the date of the initiatory act, so as to cut off intervening\nclaimants.” (Knapp v. Alexander Co., supra, 237 U.S. at p. 167.) Thus, the period of\nacceptance of an RS 2477 offer to dedicate ended upon the homesteader’s entry and not,\nas Ball stated, “when the patent was issued.” (Ball, supra, 68 Cal.App.2d at pp. 847-\n848.) Plaintiffs unpersuasively reject this limitations argument derived from United\nStates Supreme Court authority, by noting that Ball, a state appellate court decision,\nstates otherwise. Even under Ball’s limitations period, the result here is the same.\n\n                                                38\n\ffor different purposes” such as “hunters, miners and vacationists. About 1905 numerous\nmining claims were located above the land defendant homesteaded and the locality\nattracted the attention of oil operators. A derrick was erected and work was done on a\nwell which was located more than a mile from the land in question . . . . Materials and\nsupplies were hauled to the well by a route which followed another canyon, but the trail\nleading down from the vicinity of the well toward defendant’s land was made into a road\nover which a two-horse wagon could pass.” This “[t]ravel was not merely occasional.”\n(Id. at pp. 848-849.) The evidence was sufficient to affirm the finding that the road was\npublic. (Id. at p. 845.)16\n       Here, the relevant evidence is that which shows public use of Henry Ridge\nMotorway, and that portion of Gold Stone Road which connects with Greenleaf Canyon\nRoad, for five years before 1897 when the homesteader must have entered the\nErickson/Malick north land. The record is devoid of any such evidence.\n       The trial court first cited the 1895 survey plat as evidence of public use. That\nsurvey depicts a “Road.” The trial court “inferred that it would not have been designated\nas a road where the current location of Henry Ridge Motorway exists absent use.” This is\nnot a legally permissible inference: The mere existence of a road on a map does not\nshow its use was public. “Whether it also became a public street did not depend upon the\nfact alone that the land appears on these maps as a public street, but whether the proof\nshowed that it had been offered for dedication, and accepted as such by user or\notherwise.” (Whelan v. Boyd (1892) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501; accord, Hays v.

Ball distinguished the evidence predating the\npatent from the post-patent evidence, noting that only evidence of the former was\nrelevant to a dedication finding. (Ball, supra, 68 Cal.App.2d at pp. 848-850.)\n\n                                             39\n\fpublic, then all roads depicted on all maps would be impliedly dedicated to public use\nrendering the “use” requirement a nullity. The 1895 survey plat is not evidence of use.\n       The trial court inferred public use from the fact that patentees “and others” used\nthe “Road” for five years to meet the requirements of the Homestead Act. Yet, there is\nno evidence of “others.” Plaintiffs’ expert Stanley acknowledged that the only evidence\nof use was an inference from the fact of the homesteaders’ patents that those\nhomesteaders “used this road to get access.” Homesteaders alone do not constitute a\n“various group” or “diverse” use by the public as required by Gion and Blasius, and do\nnot amount to the same assortment of users cited as sufficient in Ball. Also, the record\ncontains evidence of fewer than a dozen patentees along Henry Ridge Motorway, which\nis a “limited and definable number of persons” and hence an insufficient amount.\n(Gion, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 39.) Moreover, a private homesteader’s use for the purposes\nof obtaining fee title to the land by patent cannot also constitute public use that would\ndivest the same homesteader of his rights to that same land. (See, e.g., United States v.\nClarke, supra, 529 F.2d at p. 986.) For these reasons, the patentees are not evidence of\npublic use.\n       There is also insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that the part\nof Gold Stone Road at the Burkes’ driveway and Greenleaf Canyon Road was part of the\n“Road” in 1895 that later became Henry Ridge Motorway. “[W]e uphold the findings if\nsupported by substantial evidence. [Citations.]” (Thorstrom, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1417.) However, “[a] decision supported by a mere scintilla of evidence need not be\naffirmed on appeal.

The first map was a composite created by Stanley who admitted her\ncreation did not show the 1895 “Road” connecting to Greenleaf Canyon Road, and who\n\n                                             40\n\ftestified only that “depending on how accurate this map is, [it shows a road] possibly also\ngoing over a portion of the land owned by Burke.” (Italics added.) This is rank\nspeculation. The second map the court cited was created by MacNeil, who testified he\nderived it from 1930s CSB maps which reflect potential as well as existing road\nalignments. More important, he testified that it was “never established that it was\n[Henry Ridge] Motorway all the way to [Greenleaf Canyon Road].” Thus, the court had\nno solid evidence on which to find that the Burkes’ portion of Gold Stone Road was once\npart of the 1895 “Road.”\n        Finally, none of the other evidence relied on by the trial court is substantial, and\nall of it postdates 1902. For instance, the 1908 map depicts a post office, two taverns,\nand a house. The map is too recent, and all of the sites listed thereon are located on roads\nother than Henry Ridge Motorway. Similarly, none of Stanley’s photographs shows use\non Henry Ridge Motorway. Indeed, the 1895 survey plat and Stanley’s testimony only\nconfirm that the 1895 “Road” did not connect to any destination-point, while there were\nother roads leading to the Section 1 and Section 7 patents. Considering all of the\nevidence adduced here, it amounts to the mere fact that a road existed on the 1895 survey\nplat and may have been used by a handful of homesteaders whose entry cut off public\nuse. These facts are insufficient as a matter of law to constitute a public acceptance of\nthe RS 2477 offer.17 Therefore, the trial court erred in ruling that Henry Ridge Motorway\nand a portion of Gold Stone Road were impliedly dedicated to the public based on RS\n2477.\n        The portion of the judgment declaring Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone\nRoad dedicated to public use must be reversed.18\n\n17\n      The Los Angeles County Fire Department’s maintenance of the road is not\nevidence of acceptance by the County of a dedication to public use. The County\nmaintained the road after 1902.\n18\n      As the result of our conclusion here that the portion of the judgment finding\nimplied easement and implied dedication to public use must be reversed, we need not\naddress defendants’ additional contentions on appeal.\n\n                                              41\n\f                                              II\n                                  PLAINTIFFS’ APPEAL\n       1. No express easement\n       Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that\nplaintiffs had failed to establish they had an express easement based on the 1968 and\n1970 Declarations.\n       Quoting from the express language of the 1968 and 1970 Declarations, these\ninstruments state that the grantors “hereby grant said easements to all owners, their heirs,\nsuccessors and assigns in [Sections 12 and 1, respectively] as said owners’ fee interest\nappear of record, the vesting of title to said easements to take effect upon recording in the\noffice of the County Recorder by any fee owner of a portion of said Sec. [12 and 1,\nrespectively] of an acceptance of said easements.” (Italics added.) There is no evidence\nthat acceptances were ever recorded.\n       Notwithstanding these instruments’ clear requirement of a recorded acceptance,\nplaintiffs contend the law does not require an acceptance and so that requirement is\n“repugnant to the grant itself.” Citing Stanley’s opinion testimony, plaintiffs also argue\nsuch “language was immaterial to the express grant of easement rights.”\n       Interpretation of these instruments is solely a judicial function unless it turns on\ncredibility of extrinsic evidence. (City of Manhattan Beach v. Superior Court, supra,\n13 Cal.4th at p. 238.) “Opinion testimony is inadmissible and irrelevant to adjudging\nquestions of law. [Citations.]” (Adams v. City of Fremont (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2277616\"><a href=\"/opinion/2277616/adams-v-city-of-fremont/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n266.) The instruments’ requirement of a recorded acceptance is clear and unassailable\nand so Stanley’s opinion is irrelevant. We cannot idly dismiss the acceptance language.\nFuture owners rely on the express language of the grants for certainty. It is undisputed\nthat no such acceptance of the easements in the 1968 and 1970 Declarations was\nrecorded. Therefore, the trial court did not err in ruling that plaintiffs had not proven\ntheir right to an access easement by express grant.\n\n\n\n\n                                              42\n\f       2. No easement by prescription\n       Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in ruling they did not establish an easement\nfor ingress and egress across Henry Ridge Motorway and Gold Stone Road by\nprescription. The prescriptive period is an uninterrupted five years. (Warsaw v. Chicago\nMetallic Ceilings, Inc. (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1317119\"><a href=\"/opinion/1317119/warsaw-v-chicago-metallic-ceilings-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 570-571.) “[A] party seeking to establish a\nprescriptive easement has the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Grant v. Ratliff (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1304</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1310.) The court ruled, “As\nto the Prescriptive Easement, the Court’s concern is that it could not determine the exact\n5 year period necessary to meet the elements.”\n       The evidence is disputed. Scher testified he used the roads 1,400 times between\n1998 and 2005. Plaintiff McAllister testified she used the road 6-14 times per week\nduring this same period. In contrast, a witness who lived on the Schroders’ property\nbetween 1993 and 2005 did not believe these claims “for a moment.” Another resident\non the Schroders’ property testified that the claimed use of “200 times per year” was\nimpossible given that that resident watched the property carefully beginning in 1991 and\nturned people back. The Schroders never saw Scher or McAllister drive along\nGold Stone Road. Erickson saw Scher “twice in the 20 years that I’ve been there” and\nsimply did not think it was possible that McAllister used the road as often as she claimed.\nMalick never saw either plaintiff use the subject roads. Marshall and the Burkes\nacknowledged only that they saw “people” on the roads.\n       Plaintiffs argue the record contains adequate evidence of their use for the\nprescriptive period because the trial court found earlier in its statement of\ndecision: “Here, until 2006, the continuous, unobstructed and unimpeded use of\nHenry Ridge Motorway and [Gold Stone] Road by Plaintiffs, other residents, the\nDefendants themselves, strangers, delivery drivers, workers, motorcyclists, lookie-loos,\nand teenagers, among others, constitutes sufficient public use to accept the implied\ndedication of the roads.” (Italics added.) This statement is irrelevant because it was\nmade in conjunction with the trial court’s finding of an implied dedication to use by the\npublic, which requires a diverse collection of users. The statement does not segregate\n\n                                             43\n\fplaintiffs’ use. By contrast, in declining to find a prescriptive easement, the trial court\nfound that plaintiffs’ use was not continuous for five years.\n       Plaintiffs filed no objections to the statement of decision and so the doctrine of\nimplied findings applies. “The doctrine of implied findings requires the appellate court to\ninfer the trial court made all factual findings necessary to support the judgment.\n[Citation.]” (Fladeboe v. American Isuzu Motors Inc. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2254900\"><a href=\"/opinion/2254900/fladeboe-v-american-isuzu-motors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58.)\nParties must “point out deficiencies in the trial court’s statement of decision as a\ncondition of avoiding [the doctrine of] implied findings.” (In re Marriage of Arceneaux\n(1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612381\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612381/in-re-marriage-of-arceneaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1134.) Under the doctrine of implied findings, where the\nevidence is in dispute, we must infer that the court did not believe plaintiffs’ assertion\nthat their own use was continuous for five years, or at the very least, that plaintiffs failed\nto demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence which continuous five years they used\nthe roads.\n       3. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to declare an equitable\neasement.\n       Plaintiffs challenge the trial court’s finding that they failed to provide sufficient\nevidence to support their claim for equitable easement.\n       “Through the doctrine of ‘balancing conveniences’ or ‘relative hardship,’ the trial\ncourt may create an easement by refusing to enjoin an encroachment or nuisance.”\n(Linthicum v. Butterfield (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 265 (Linthicum).)\n       “In appropriate cases in which the requirements for traditional easements are not\npresent, California courts have exercised their equity powers to fashion protective\ninterests in land belonging to another, sometimes referring to such an interest as an\n‘equitable easement.’ [Citations.]” (Tashakori v. Lakis (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1008 (Tashakori).) Three factors must be present to create an equitable\neasement: “(1) [the trespasser’s] trespass was ‘ “innocent” ’ rather than ‘ “willful or\nnegligent,” ’ (2) the public or the property owner will not be ‘ “ ‘irreparabl[y]\ninjur[ed]’ ” ’ by the easement, and (3) the hardship to the trespasser from having to cease\nthe trespass is ‘ “ ‘greatly disproportionate to the hardship caused [the owner] by the\n\n                                              44\n\fcontinuance of the encroachment.’ ” ’ [Citations.]” (Shoen v. Zacarias (2015)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19.)\n       “When reviewing a trial court’s exercise of its equity powers to fashion an\nequitable easement, we will overturn the decision only if we find that the court abused its\ndiscretion. [Citation.]” (Tashakori, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1008.)\n       In Linthicum, the trial court found that the contested roadway “is the only access to\nthe Butterfields’ parcels” and that the Butterfields would suffer “catastrophic loss” were\nthe easement not created. By contrast, the roadway did not affect Linthicum’s right to\nfully develop his parcel. (Linthicum, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p. 266, italics added.)\nSimilarly, the Tashakori court applied the relative hardship test and found that the\ndefendants would suffer virtually no harm from the plaintiffs’ use of the shared driveway,\nwhereas the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed because the easement was the sole\nmeans of accessing the property. (Tashakori, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1010.)\n       Here, plaintiffs contend they will be irreparably harmed, not because Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road is the only means of reaching their Section 1 property,\nas there are several other routes plaintiffs can use to travel from their Section 1 property\nto Topanga. Rather, plaintiffs argue Henry Ridge Motorway to Gold Stone Road “is the\nquickest and most convenient route.” (Italics added.) Convenience is not sufficient\nunder Linthicum or Tashakori, certainly not when compared to the irreparable harm to\ndefendants by making their private, secluded land open to plaintiffs’ convenience.\nPlaintiffs contend they will suffer irreparable harm if they cannot use Henry Ridge\nMotorway and Gold Stone Road in case of emergency. However, we accept the\nrepresentation of the Erickson/Malicks and Schroders that they would allow plaintiffs to\nuse these roads in emergencies. As for plaintiffs’ Section 12 lot, Henry Ridge Motorway\nand Gold Stone Road do not even touch it, with the result there are no equities in\nplaintiffs’ favor with respect to that land.\n       Finally, considering the parties’ conduct to determine who is responsible for the\ndispute, plaintiffs are not innocent. (Tashakori, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1009;\nLinthicum, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at pp. 266-267.) Scher testified that since buying his\n\n                                               45\n\fSection 1 property in 1998, he intended to establish rights across Henry Ridge Motorway\nand Gold Stone Road and he purchased his Section 12 property “ ‘partially to stick a\nthorn in my neighbor’s side.’ ” The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to\ncreate an equitable easement.]]\n                               [[End nonpublished portion]]\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiffs’ causes of action for declarations\nof express, prescriptive, and equitable easements is affirmed.
