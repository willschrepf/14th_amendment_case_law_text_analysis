See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n\n                             OPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n  Plaintiffs are actual and potential investors in TutorNet.com, Inc.\n(\"TutorNet\"), a company created to provide online tutoring services.\n\f               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS                     5\nThey sued the principals and certain employees of TutorNet (the \"Tu-\ntorNet defendants\"), as well as Primus Telecommunications Group,\nInc. and other related entities (collectively, \"Primus\" or the \"Primus\ndefendants\"), alleging that they were induced to invest in TutorNet by\nfraudulent misrepresentations concerning TutorNet’s business opera-\ntions and future prospects. At the close of Plaintiffs’ case, the district\ncourt granted judgment as a matter of law to Primus, concluding that\nPrimus could not be held responsible, either directly or vicariously,\nfor Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   Euburn Forde founded TutorNet in 1997 while working as a con-\nsultant for Primus. Forde served as President and Chief Executive\nOfficer of TutorNet, and Rajiv Dalal served as Vice-president and\nChief Financial Officer. Although Forde left Primus to work full-time\non his new venture, he maintained a relationship with Primus execu-\ntives. In late 1998, Forde and Dalal met with Neil Hazard, Chief\nFinancial Officer of Primus, to solicit an investment from Primus in\nTutorNet. According to Hazard, Primus followed a standard protocol\nbefore investing in another company: (1) negotiate a nonbinding term\nsheet outlining the parties’ respective commitments, (2) conduct due\ndiligence on the company seeking the investment, and (3) upon satis-\nfactory responses to due diligence inquiries, consummate the invest-\nment by exchanging funds for stock.\n\n   In January 1999, Forde and Hazard signed a \"Summary of Terms\"\nthat outlined a potential business relationship between the two compa-\nnies. According to the Summary of Terms, TutorNet would form a\nnew company into which it would invest all of its existing assets, and\nPrimus would contribute $400,000 to the new company in return for\n19.9% of its stock. Primus would be entitled to appoint one member\nof the new company’s board of directors and would have certain vot-\ning rights. The Summary of Terms explicitly stated that it was not a\nbinding agreement and that consummation of the transactions outlined\nin the document was contingent on execution of definitive formal\ndocuments. Having agreed on this Summary of Terms, Hazard pre-\nsented Forde with a due diligence checklist.\n\f6               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n   About a week after the Summary of Terms was signed, Forde\napproached Hazard to ask for help in funding and administering\nTutorNet’s payroll. Hazard agreed, and Primus incorporated a subsid-\niary, TutorNet.com Services, Inc. (\"Services\"), to provide administra-\ntive payroll services for TutorNet.1 For a period of about four months\n— from January to April 1999 — Primus deposited funds into a Ser-\nvices account to cover the payroll for certain TutorNet employees.\nPrimus withheld taxes and prepared W-2 forms for these employees,\nand it offered them certain benefits available to Primus employees.\nBy April 1999, TutorNet had enough money of its own to cover the\npayroll. TutorNet began depositing funds into the Services account\nfor that purpose, and all the deposited funds were paid out to Tutor-\nNet employees. Several months later, TutorNet began paying its\nemployees from an account separate from the Services account.\n\n   Primus supported TutorNet’s operations in several other ways dur-\ning the due diligence period. In addition to administering the payroll\n(through Services), Primus provided office space for TutorNet\nemployees; offered health insurance for TutorNet employees; allowed\nTutorNet to use its Federal Express account number; and made an\ninstallment payment for software that TutorNet had acquired. In all,\nPrimus provided financial and administrative support valued at just\nover $300,000.\n\n   When TutorNet did not satisfy its due diligence obligations — par-\nticularly when it failed to provide Primus a list of other investors —\nPrimus informed TutorNet that it did not intend to consummate the\ninvestment outlined in the Summary of Terms. The parties never exe-\ncuted the definitive documents called for by the Summary of Terms,\nso Primus never became a shareholder of the new company. Hazard\nasked Forde to repay Primus for the assistance it had provided — just\nover $300,000 — and Forde agreed to pay back that sum when he had\nthe money. This specific agreement was never reduced to writing, and\nin the end, Primus never got its money back.\n\n   In April 2000, TutorNet completed a \"reverse merger\" with a pub-\nlicly traded shell corporation, resulting in the creation of TutorNet\n    1\n   Hazard testified that he thought it wise to set up a new entity to ensure\nthat TutorNet activities were segregated from other Primus activities.\n\f               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS                     7\nGroup, Inc. (\"TGI\"). Although Forde had promised many TutorNet\ninvestors that they would become shareholders in a publicly traded\ncompany, Plaintiffs’ shares were not converted into TGI shares. Left\nwith nothing to replace their now-worthless TutorNet shares, Plain-\ntiffs filed this lawsuit, alleging that the TutorNet defendants and the\nPrimus defendants fraudulently induced them to invest in TutorNet.\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged the following misrepresentations: (1)\nTutorNet had already entered into contracts with AOL, Prentice-Hall,\nand other companies, (2) TutorNet would go public within a few\nmonths, and (3) after TutorNet went public, investors would be free\nto sell their shares at any time. Some plaintiffs testified that they were\ntold Primus actually owned 19.9% of the company.\n\n   After removing certain claims from the case, the district court tried\na \"test case\" involving 15 of the 138 plaintiffs. (The parties agreed\nthat the remaining plaintiffs would be bound by collateral estoppel\nwith respect to common issues.) The jury returned verdicts for Plain-\ntiffs against the TutorNet defendants totaling approximately $176 mil-\nlion.\n\n   The claims against Primus never went to the jury. At the close of\nPlaintiffs’ case, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law\nto the Primus defendants on Counts IX and X of the complaint, which\nalleged aiding and abetting and conspiracy to commit common-law\nfraud. (Plaintiffs have not challenged this order.) Ten days later, but\nbefore trial resumed, the district court granted judgment as a matter\nof law to the Primus defendants on the remaining counts against them\n— Count III (violation of the Securities and Exchange Act and Rule\n10b-5), Count IV (piercing the corporate veil), Count V (control per-\nson liability), and Count XI (vicarious liability for securities fraud and\ncommon-law fraud). Finding it \"undisputed and undisputable\" that no\nPrimus official ever made a misrepresentation to Plaintiffs, the district\ncourt concluded that Plaintiffs could not prevail on any theory of\ndirect liability against Primus. The district court further concluded\nthat Plaintiffs could not prevail on their vicarious liability theories\neither, because (1) Primus lacked the requisite power to control Tutor-\nNet and so was not the employer of the TutorNet defendants, (2) Pri-\nmus was not a \"control person\" for purposes of federal securities\nlaws, and (3) Primus had not agreed to share profits and losses with\n\f8               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS\nTutorNet such that it could be considered a joint venturer with Tutor-\nNet.\n\n   Several Plaintiffs appeal the district court’s order entering judg-\nment as a matter of law in favor of Primus.2 Plaintiffs do not chal-\nlenge the district court’s ruling that Primus could not be liable directly\nfor making any misrepresentations. Rather, this appeal involves only\nthe district court’s rejection of Plaintiffs’ vicarious liability claims.3\n\n                                     II.\n\n   We review de novo the district court’s order granting judgment as\na matter of law. Sales v. Grant, 158 F.3d 768, 775 (4th Cir. 1998).\nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, judgment as a matter of law is appropriate\nonly where \"a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no\nlegally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for\nthat party on that issue.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a). In deciding a Rule 50\nmotion, the district court should review all the evidence in the record.\n    2\n     In a footnote to their reply brief, Plaintiffs assert that \"[t]his appeal\nwas intended to apply to all plaintiffs bound by the district court’s order\ndismissing Primus.\" Primus moved to strike this footnote, and we grant\nthe motion. Fed. R. App. P. 3(c) requires that a notice of appeal \"specify\nthe party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption\nor body of the notice.\" Even if a party is not specifically named, a court\nof appeals may exercise jurisdiction over that party if its \"intent to appeal\nis otherwise clear from the notice.\" Fed. R. App. P. 3(c). The notice of\nappeal filed in this case specifically identifies twelve Plaintiffs as the\nparties taking the appeal; it does not make any reference to other parties\nwho are bound by the district court’s order. Those other parties are not\nproperly before us.\n   3\n     Plaintiffs also challenge the district court’s denial of their motion to\nunseal certain documents submitted by Genesis Insurance Company, lia-\nbility insurer for two individual Primus defendants, in connection with\nits motion to intervene in the case. The district court specifically\napproved the submission of the documents under seal and ultimately\ndetermined that the documents were subject to the attorney/client privi-\nlege and the work-product doctrine and had \"no connection to the issues\nin this litigation.\" We review the district court’s ruling for an abuse of\ndiscretion, see Under Seal v. Under Seal, 326 F.3d 479, 485 (4th Cir.\n2003), and upon our own review of the documents, we find none.\n\f                ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS                      9\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150\n(2000). \"In doing so, however, the court must draw all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make cred-\nibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\" Id. In other words, the\ncourt must \"disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that\nthe jury is not required to believe.\" Reeves, 530 U.S. at 151.4\n\n                                    A.\n\n   The district court granted judgment as a matter of law to Primus\non Plaintiffs’ respondeat superior and \"control person\" claims based\non its conclusion that Primus did not control, or have the power to\ncontrol, the activities of the TutorNet defendants. Under Virginia law,\nthe \"power to control\" is the determinative factor in deciding whether\na master-servant relationship exists. McDonald v. Hampton Training\nSch. for Nurses, 486 S.E.2d 299, 301 (Va. 1997).5 Similarly, in order\nto establish \"control person\" liability under federal law, a plaintiff\nmust prove both an underlying violation of the securities laws and the\ndefendant’s control over the primary violator. Maher v. Durango Met-\nals, Inc., 144 F.3d 1302, 1305 (10th Cir. 1998); Brown v. Enstar\nGroup, Inc., 84 F.3d 393, 396-97 (11th Cir. 1996).6\n  4\n     Plaintiffs argue that the testimony of Forde and Dalal cannot be used\nto support Primus’s motion for judgment as a matter of law because they\nare interested witnesses. For this proposition, Plaintiffs rely upon the\nstatement in Reeves that \"the court should give credence to the evidence\nfavoring the nonmovant as well as that evidence supporting the moving\nparty that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at least to the extent that\nthe evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.\" 530 U.S. at 151. We\ndo not read Reeves so broadly as to preclude consideration of uncontra-\ndicted testimony simply because it comes from a party to the lawsuit. See\nTraylor v. Brown, 295 F.3d 783, 791 (7th Cir. 2002).\n   5\n     This element of control is also necessary to warrant imputation of a\nwholly-owned subsidiary’s liabilities to its parent corporation. Eure v.\nNorfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp., Inc., 561 S.E.2d 663, 664 (Va.\n2002).\n   6\n     By regulation, \"control\" is defined as \"the possession, direct or indi-\nrect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and\npolicies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities,\nby contract or otherwise.\" 17 C.F.R. § 230.405.\n\f10              ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n   The district court properly concluded that Plaintiffs failed to\nadduce evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Pri-\nmus controlled, or had the power to control, the TutorNet defendants.\nIt is undisputed that there was never a formal business relationship\nbetween Primus and TutorNet that gave Primus authority over Tutor-\nNet’s business affairs. Nor was there evidence of Primus’s actually\nasserting such authority. To the contrary, Forde and Dalal both testi-\nfied that Forde controlled the activities of TutorNet and no one con-\ntrolled Forde. This testimony was consistent with the testimony of\nseveral plaintiffs (former TutorNet employees) who stated that they\nworked at the direction of Forde, not any Primus official. Mary\nMcMartin testified, for instance, that her work assignments came\nfrom Forde and Dalal, not from any Primus official.\n\n   Nevertheless, Plaintiffs argue that the jury could have found that\nPrimus controlled TutorNet because (1) Primus’s investment was nec-\nessary for the continuing viability of TutorNet, (2) Hazard (a Primus\nofficer) sent an e-mail to Dalal (a TutorNet officer) stating a need to\nfinalize an investment agreement and \"get the day to day operations\nsorted out,\" and (3) Forde (a TutorNet officer) sent an e-mail to Haz-\nard (a Primus officer) concerning a potential TutorNet investor. This\nevidence is not sufficient to prove Primus’s control of TutorNet.\n\n   First, proof of the size of Primus’s anticipated investment is not\nproof of control. Under Plaintiffs’ theory, any large-scale investor is\nliable for the acts of the company in which it invests because the com-\npany might fail if the investor walked away. The facts of this case\nshow that Primus’s anticipated investment was only about 20 percent\nof the stock of the new company, and a 20 percent share hardly\namounts to control of the new company. Second, to the extent that\nPlaintiffs point to Primus’s providing payroll services, office space,\na fax machine, and a FedEx account for use by TutorNet, we note that\nPrimus’s assistance was merely temporary and that TutorNet had\nobtained much more funding from other investors than Primus was\nproviding. Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that Primus controlled, or\nhad the power to control, the TutorNet defendants merely by proof of\nPrimus’s offering assistance to TutorNet to protect its anticipated invest-\nment.7\n  7\n   Plaintiffs’ reliance upon Farlow v. Wachovia Bank of N.C., 259 F.3d\n309 (4th Cir. 2001), is misplaced. Farlow does not purport to apply Vir-\n\f               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS                   11\n   Nor does the March 1, 1999, e-mail from Hazard to Dalal establish\nPrimus’s control over the TutorNet defendants. This e-mail shows an\nexercise of due diligence in anticipation of an investment, not a set-\ntled master-servant relationship:\n\n    Rajiv — We also need to finalize our investment agreement\n    and get the day to day operations sorted out. Specifically, [a\n    Primus executive] has asked that you give us the asset list-\n    ing as of January and the liabilities for the software so that\n    we have an opening balance sheet of the new company. You\n    also need to give us the list of customers and set up the\n    monthly billing procedures.\n\nThis e-mail was written in March 1999 — more than a month after\nPrimus incorporated Services — and it sought information to be used\nin preparation for the operation of a new company. The contemplated\ninvestment agreement had not yet been worked out, there was no\nagreement concerning day-to-day operations of the new company,\nand Primus needed information so that it could set up a balance sheet\nfor that company. In other words, none of the things mentioned in the\ne-mail had been accomplished. For that reason alone, this e-mail can-\nnot be read to evidence Primus’s control over TutorNet. The addi-\ntional fact that Primus never received from TutorNet the information\nit requested in this e-mail likewise undermines Plaintiffs’ argument\nthat Primus had the power to control TutorNet and was ordering its\ndaily activities.\n\nginia law, as we must in this case, and Virginia law specifically distin-\nguishes the payment of compensation from the power to control.\nMcDonald v. Hampton Training Sch. for Nurses, 486 S.E.2d 299, 301\n(Va. 1997). Under Virginia law, the facts that Services paid compensa-\ntion, withheld taxes, and prepared tax documents for TutorNet employ-\nees do not establish that a master-servant relationship existed between\nServices (or Primus) and the TutorNet defendants. See Metro Mach.\nCorp. v. Mizenko, 419 S.E.2d 632, 635 (Va. 1992) (holding that the tort-\nfeasor was the servant of the company that exercised complete control\nover his work and working conditions, not the company that paid his sal-\nary and worker’s compensation benefits).\n\f12             ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n   Plaintiffs also point to a February 23, 1999, e-mail from Dalal to\nHazard, wherein Dalal made Hazard aware of discussions he was hav-\ning with another potential investor. According to Plaintiffs, this e-\nmail \"demonstrates how Forde and Dalal looked to Primus for direc-\ntion on financial matters.\" Actually, all the e-mail shows is one party\nto a future business endeavor keeping another party to that endeavor\ninformed of developments concerning their common interest. There\nis nothing in this e-mail that suggests TutorNet’s submission to Pri-\nmus’s authority or control.\n\n   Plaintiffs’ assertions that Primus controlled TutorNet are not sup-\nported by the evidence presented at trial. Accordingly, the district\ncourt properly entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of Primus\non Plaintiffs’ respondeat superior and \"control person\" theories of\nliability.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   The district court also granted judgment as a matter of law to Pri-\nmus on Plaintiffs’ joint-venture theory of liability. Under Virginia\nlaw, \"[a] joint venture exists where two or more parties enter into a\nspecial combination for the purpose of a specific business undertak-\ning, jointly seeking a profit, gain, or other benefit, without any actual\npartnership or corporate designation.\" PGI, Inc. v. Rathe Prods., Inc.,\n576 S.E.2d 438, 441 (Va. 2003) (quoting Roark v. Hicks, 362 S.E.2d\n711, 714 (Va. 1987)). It is essential to a joint venture that the partici-\npants agree, expressly or impliedly, \"that they are to share in the prof-\nits or losses of the enterprise, and that each is to have a voice in its\ncontrol and management.\" Id. (quoting Smith v. Grenadier, 127\nS.E.2d 107, 110 (Va. 1962)). See also Flip Mortgage Corp. v. McEl-\nhone, 841 F.2d 531, 539-40 (4th Cir. 1988) (dismissing a fiduciary\nduty claim where the parties’ contract showed no agreement to share\nprofits or losses).\n\n   Plaintiffs produced no evidence in this case showing that Primus\nagreed to share profits or losses with TutorNet. Instead, Plaintiffs rely\nupon a letter from Primus to a third party indicating that Primus \"had\npartnered with\" TutorNet. The district court properly ruled that this\nsingle statement could not support a finding that there was a legal\npartnership or joint venture. More specifically, this single statement\n\f                ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS                     13\ndoes not demonstrate that any agreement had been made to share\nprofits or losses. Moreover, for the reasons discussed above, Primus\ndid not share in the control or management of TutorNet. Thus, the dis-\ntrict court properly concluded that there was no joint venture between\nPrimus and TutorNet.8\n\n                                    III.\n\n   Plaintiffs failed to adduce evidence at trial establishing that Primus\ncontrolled, or had the power to control, the activities of the TutorNet\ndefendants. Judgment as a matter of law was therefore appropriate on\nPlaintiffs’ respondeat superior and \"control person\" claims. Judgment\nas a matter of law was appropriate on Plaintiffs’ joint venture claim\nbecause there was no evidence suggesting an agreement to share prof-\nits and losses. For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is\nin all respects\n\n                                                              AFFIRMED.\n  8\n   To the extent that the district court relied upon the absence of a formal\ncontract to hold that there was no joint venture, that was error. The ques-\ntion is whether the parties expressly or impliedly agreed to undertake a\njoint venture, not whether they executed a document to that effect. PGI,\n576 S.E.2d at 340. For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the\nparties’ conduct did not evidence a joint venture under Virginia law.\n\f",

See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n\n                             OPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n  Plaintiffs are actual and potential investors in TutorNet.com, Inc.\n(\"TutorNet\"), a company created to provide online tutoring services.\n\f               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS                     5\nThey sued the principals and certain employees of TutorNet (the \"Tu-\ntorNet defendants\"), as well as Primus Telecommunications Group,\nInc. and other related entities (collectively, \"Primus\" or the \"Primus\ndefendants\"), alleging that they were induced to invest in TutorNet by\nfraudulent misrepresentations concerning TutorNet’s business opera-\ntions and future prospects. At the close of Plaintiffs’ case, the district\ncourt granted judgment as a matter of law to Primus, concluding that\nPrimus could not be held responsible, either directly or vicariously,\nfor Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   Euburn Forde founded TutorNet in 1997 while working as a con-\nsultant for Primus. Forde served as President and Chief Executive\nOfficer of TutorNet, and Rajiv Dalal served as Vice-president and\nChief Financial Officer. Although Forde left Primus to work full-time\non his new venture, he maintained a relationship with Primus execu-\ntives. In late 1998, Forde and Dalal met with Neil Hazard, Chief\nFinancial Officer of Primus, to solicit an investment from Primus in\nTutorNet. According to Hazard, Primus followed a standard protocol\nbefore investing in another company: (1) negotiate a nonbinding term\nsheet outlining the parties’ respective commitments, (2) conduct due\ndiligence on the company seeking the investment, and (3) upon satis-\nfactory responses to due diligence inquiries, consummate the invest-\nment by exchanging funds for stock.\n\n   In January 1999, Forde and Hazard signed a \"Summary of Terms\"\nthat outlined a potential business relationship between the two compa-\nnies. According to the Summary of Terms, TutorNet would form a\nnew company into which it would invest all of its existing assets, and\nPrimus would contribute $400,000 to the new company in return for\n19.9% of its stock. Primus would be entitled to appoint one member\nof the new company’s board of directors and would have certain vot-\ning rights. The Summary of Terms explicitly stated that it was not a\nbinding agreement and that consummation of the transactions outlined\nin the document was contingent on execution of definitive formal\ndocuments. Having agreed on this Summary of Terms, Hazard pre-\nsented Forde with a due diligence checklist.\n\f6               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n   About a week after the Summary of Terms was signed, Forde\napproached Hazard to ask for help in funding and administering\nTutorNet’s payroll. Hazard agreed, and Primus incorporated a subsid-\niary, TutorNet.com Services, Inc. (\"Services\"), to provide administra-\ntive payroll services for TutorNet.1 For a period of about four months\n— from January to April 1999 — Primus deposited funds into a Ser-\nvices account to cover the payroll for certain TutorNet employees.\nPrimus withheld taxes and prepared W-2 forms for these employees,\nand it offered them certain benefits available to Primus employees.\nBy April 1999, TutorNet had enough money of its own to cover the\npayroll. TutorNet began depositing funds into the Services account\nfor that purpose, and all the deposited funds were paid out to Tutor-\nNet employees. Several months later, TutorNet began paying its\nemployees from an account separate from the Services account.\n\n   Primus supported TutorNet’s operations in several other ways dur-\ning the due diligence period. In addition to administering the payroll\n(through Services), Primus provided office space for TutorNet\nemployees; offered health insurance for TutorNet employees; allowed\nTutorNet to use its Federal Express account number; and made an\ninstallment payment for software that TutorNet had acquired. In all,\nPrimus provided financial and administrative support valued at just\nover $300,000.\n\n   When TutorNet did not satisfy its due diligence obligations — par-\nticularly when it failed to provide Primus a list of other investors —\nPrimus informed TutorNet that it did not intend to consummate the\ninvestment outlined in the Summary of Terms. The parties never exe-\ncuted the definitive documents called for by the Summary of Terms,\nso Primus never became a shareholder of the new company. Hazard\nasked Forde to repay Primus for the assistance it had provided — just\nover $300,000 — and Forde agreed to pay back that sum when he had\nthe money. This specific agreement was never reduced to writing, and\nin the end, Primus never got its money back.\n\n   In April 2000, TutorNet completed a \"reverse merger\" with a pub-\nlicly traded shell corporation, resulting in the creation of TutorNet\n    1\n   Hazard testified that he thought it wise to set up a new entity to ensure\nthat TutorNet activities were segregated from other Primus activities.\n\f               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS                     7\nGroup, Inc. (\"TGI\"). Although Forde had promised many TutorNet\ninvestors that they would become shareholders in a publicly traded\ncompany, Plaintiffs’ shares were not converted into TGI shares. Left\nwith nothing to replace their now-worthless TutorNet shares, Plain-\ntiffs filed this lawsuit, alleging that the TutorNet defendants and the\nPrimus defendants fraudulently induced them to invest in TutorNet.\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged the following misrepresentations: (1)\nTutorNet had already entered into contracts with AOL, Prentice-Hall,\nand other companies, (2) TutorNet would go public within a few\nmonths, and (3) after TutorNet went public, investors would be free\nto sell their shares at any time. Some plaintiffs testified that they were\ntold Primus actually owned 19.9% of the company.\n\n   After removing certain claims from the case, the district court tried\na \"test case\" involving 15 of the 138 plaintiffs. (The parties agreed\nthat the remaining plaintiffs would be bound by collateral estoppel\nwith respect to common issues.) The jury returned verdicts for Plain-\ntiffs against the TutorNet defendants totaling approximately $176 mil-\nlion.\n\n   The claims against Primus never went to the jury. At the close of\nPlaintiffs’ case, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law\nto the Primus defendants on Counts IX and X of the complaint, which\nalleged aiding and abetting and conspiracy to commit common-law\nfraud. (Plaintiffs have not challenged this order.) Ten days later, but\nbefore trial resumed, the district court granted judgment as a matter\nof law to the Primus defendants on the remaining counts against them\n— Count III (violation of the Securities and Exchange Act and Rule\n10b-5), Count IV (piercing the corporate veil), Count V (control per-\nson liability), and Count XI (vicarious liability for securities fraud and\ncommon-law fraud). Finding it \"undisputed and undisputable\" that no\nPrimus official ever made a misrepresentation to Plaintiffs, the district\ncourt concluded that Plaintiffs could not prevail on any theory of\ndirect liability against Primus. The district court further concluded\nthat Plaintiffs could not prevail on their vicarious liability theories\neither, because (1) Primus lacked the requisite power to control Tutor-\nNet and so was not the employer of the TutorNet defendants, (2) Pri-\nmus was not a \"control person\" for purposes of federal securities\nlaws, and (3) Primus had not agreed to share profits and losses with\n\f8               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS\nTutorNet such that it could be considered a joint venturer with Tutor-\nNet.\n\n   Several Plaintiffs appeal the district court’s order entering judg-\nment as a matter of law in favor of Primus.2 Plaintiffs do not chal-\nlenge the district court’s ruling that Primus could not be liable directly\nfor making any misrepresentations. Rather, this appeal involves only\nthe district court’s rejection of Plaintiffs’ vicarious liability claims.3\n\n                                     II.\n\n   We review de novo the district court’s order granting judgment as\na matter of law.

R. Civ. P. 50(a). In deciding a Rule 50\nmotion, the district court should review all the evidence in the record.\n    2\n     In a footnote to their reply brief, Plaintiffs assert that \"[t]his appeal\nwas intended to apply to all plaintiffs bound by the district court’s order\ndismissing Primus.\" Primus moved to strike this footnote, and we grant\nthe motion. Fed. R. App. P. 3(c) requires that a notice of appeal \"specify\nthe party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption\nor body of the notice.\" Even if a party is not specifically named, a court\nof appeals may exercise jurisdiction over that party if its \"intent to appeal\nis otherwise clear from the notice.\" Fed. R. App. P. 3(c). The notice of\nappeal filed in this case specifically identifies twelve Plaintiffs as the\nparties taking the appeal; it does not make any reference to other parties\nwho are bound by the district court’s order. Those other parties are not\nproperly before us.\n   3\n     Plaintiffs also challenge the district court’s denial of their motion to\nunseal certain documents submitted by Genesis Insurance Company, lia-\nbility insurer for two individual Primus defendants, in connection with\nits motion to intervene in the case. The district court specifically\napproved the submission of the documents under seal and ultimately\ndetermined that the documents were subject to the attorney/client privi-\nlege and the work-product doctrine and had \"no connection to the issues\nin this litigation.\" We review the district court’s ruling for an abuse of\ndiscretion, see Under Seal v.

PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n   The district court properly concluded that Plaintiffs failed to\nadduce evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Pri-\nmus controlled, or had the power to control, the TutorNet defendants.\nIt is undisputed that there was never a formal business relationship\nbetween Primus and TutorNet that gave Primus authority over Tutor-\nNet’s business affairs. Nor was there evidence of Primus’s actually\nasserting such authority. To the contrary, Forde and Dalal both testi-\nfied that Forde controlled the activities of TutorNet and no one con-\ntrolled Forde. This testimony was consistent with the testimony of\nseveral plaintiffs (former TutorNet employees) who stated that they\nworked at the direction of Forde, not any Primus official. Mary\nMcMartin testified, for instance, that her work assignments came\nfrom Forde and Dalal, not from any Primus official.\n\n   Nevertheless, Plaintiffs argue that the jury could have found that\nPrimus controlled TutorNet because (1) Primus’s investment was nec-\nessary for the continuing viability of TutorNet, (2) Hazard (a Primus\nofficer) sent an e-mail to Dalal (a TutorNet officer) stating a need to\nfinalize an investment agreement and \"get the day to day operations\nsorted out,\" and (3) Forde (a TutorNet officer) sent an e-mail to Haz-\nard (a Primus officer) concerning a potential TutorNet investor. This\nevidence is not sufficient to prove Primus’s control of TutorNet.\n\n   First, proof of the size of Primus’s anticipated investment is not\nproof of control. Under Plaintiffs’ theory, any large-scale investor is\nliable for the acts of the company in which it invests because the com-\npany might fail if the investor walked away. The facts of this case\nshow that Primus’s anticipated investment was only about 20 percent\nof the stock of the new company, and a 20 percent share hardly\namounts to control of the new company. Second, to the extent that\nPlaintiffs point to Primus’s providing payroll services, office space,\na fax machine, and a FedEx account for use by TutorNet, we note that\nPrimus’s assistance was merely temporary and that TutorNet had\nobtained much more funding from other investors than Primus was\nproviding. Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that Primus controlled, or\nhad the power to control, the TutorNet defendants merely by proof of\nPrimus’s offering assistance to TutorNet to protect its anticipated invest-\nment.7\n  7\n   Plaintiffs’ reliance upon Farlow v. Wachovia Bank of N.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774287\"><a href=\"/opinion/774287/jewel-a-farlowplaintiff-appellant-v-wachovia-bank-of-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2001), is misplaced. Farlow does not purport to apply Vir-\n\f               ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS                   11\n   Nor does the March 1, 1999, e-mail from Hazard to Dalal establish\nPrimus’s control over the TutorNet defendants. This e-mail shows an\nexercise of due diligence in anticipation of an investment, not a set-\ntled master-servant relationship:\n\n    Rajiv — We also need to finalize our investment agreement\n    and get the day to day operations sorted out. Specifically, [a\n    Primus executive] has asked that you give us the asset list-\n    ing as of January and the liabilities for the software so that\n    we have an opening balance sheet of the new company. You\n    also need to give us the list of customers and set up the\n    monthly billing procedures.\n\nThis e-mail was written in March 1999 — more than a month after\nPrimus incorporated Services — and it sought information to be used\nin preparation for the operation of a new company. The contemplated\ninvestment agreement had not yet been worked out, there was no\nagreement concerning day-to-day operations of the new company,\nand Primus needed information so that it could set up a balance sheet\nfor that company. In other words, none of the things mentioned in the\ne-mail had been accomplished. For that reason alone, this e-mail can-\nnot be read to evidence Primus’s control over TutorNet. The addi-\ntional fact that Primus never received from TutorNet the information\nit requested in this e-mail likewise undermines Plaintiffs’ argument\nthat Primus had the power to control TutorNet and was ordering its\ndaily activities.\n\nginia law, as we must in this case, and Virginia law specifically distin-\nguishes the payment of compensation from the power to control.\nMcDonald v. Hampton Training Sch. for Nurses, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060038\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060038/mcdonald-v-hampton-training-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301\n(Va. 1997). Under Virginia law, the facts that Services paid compensa-\ntion, withheld taxes, and prepared tax documents for TutorNet employ-\nees do not establish that a master-servant relationship existed between\nServices (or Primus) and the TutorNet defendants.

Mizenko, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1338730\"><a href=\"/opinion/1338730/metro-mach-corp-v-mizenko/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635 (Va. 1992) (holding that the tort-\nfeasor was the servant of the company that exercised complete control\nover his work and working conditions, not the company that paid his sal-\nary and worker’s compensation benefits).\n\f12             ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n   Plaintiffs also point to a February 23, 1999, e-mail from Dalal to\nHazard, wherein Dalal made Hazard aware of discussions he was hav-\ning with another potential investor. According to Plaintiffs, this e-\nmail \"demonstrates how Forde and Dalal looked to Primus for direc-\ntion on financial matters.\" Actually, all the e-mail shows is one party\nto a future business endeavor keeping another party to that endeavor\ninformed of developments concerning their common interest. There\nis nothing in this e-mail that suggests TutorNet’s submission to Pri-\nmus’s authority or control.\n\n   Plaintiffs’ assertions that Primus controlled TutorNet are not sup-\nported by the evidence presented at trial. Accordingly, the district\ncourt properly entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of Primus\non Plaintiffs’ respondeat superior and \"control person\" theories of\nliability.\n\n                                   B.\n\n   The district court also granted judgment as a matter of law to Pri-\nmus on Plaintiffs’ joint-venture theory of liability. Under Virginia\nlaw, \"[a] joint venture exists where two or more parties enter into a\nspecial combination for the purpose of a specific business undertak-\ning, jointly seeking a profit, gain, or other benefit, without any actual\npartnership or corporate designation.\" PGI, Inc. v. Rathe Prods., Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1059244\"><a href=\"/opinion/1059244/pgi-inc-v-rathe-productions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441 (Va. 2003) (quoting Roark v.

It is essential to a joint venture that the partici-\npants agree, expressly or impliedly, \"that they are to share in the prof-\nits or losses of the enterprise, and that each is to have a voice in its\ncontrol and management.\" Id.

Instead, Plaintiffs rely\nupon a letter from Primus to a third party indicating that Primus \"had\npartnered with\" TutorNet. The district court properly ruled that this\nsingle statement could not support a finding that there was a legal\npartnership or joint venture. More specifically, this single statement\n\f                ANDREWS v. PRIMUS TELECOMMUNICATIONS                     13\ndoes not demonstrate that any agreement had been made to share\nprofits or losses. Moreover, for the reasons discussed above, Primus\ndid not share in the control or management of TutorNet. Thus, the dis-\ntrict court properly concluded that there was no joint venture between\nPrimus and TutorNet.8\n\n                                    III.\n\n   Plaintiffs failed to adduce evidence at trial establishing that Primus\ncontrolled, or had the power to control, the activities of the TutorNet\ndefendants. Judgment as a matter of law was therefore appropriate on\nPlaintiffs’ respondeat superior and \"control person\" claims. Judgment\nas a matter of law was appropriate on Plaintiffs’ joint venture claim\nbecause there was no evidence suggesting an agreement to share prof-\nits and losses. For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is\nin all respects\n\n                                                              AFFIRMED.\n  8\n   To the extent that the district court relied upon the absence of a formal\ncontract to hold that there was no joint venture, that was error. The ques-\ntion is whether the parties expressly or impliedly agreed to undertake a\njoint venture, not whether they executed a document to that effect. PGI,\n576 S.E.2d at 340. For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the\nparties’ conduct did not evidence a joint venture under Virginia law.\n\f</pre>",
