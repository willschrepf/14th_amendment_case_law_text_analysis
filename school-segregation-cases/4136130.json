INTRODUCTION\n         In case No. SS132528A, defendant Pete Calderon Valdez, Sr., pleaded no contest\nto possession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a))\nand misdemeanor inflicting corporal injury on a spouse (Pen. Code, § 273.5, subd. (a)).1\nIn case No. SS140906A, defendant pleaded no contest to possession of a controlled\nsubstance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)) and misdemeanor violating a\nprotective order (§ 166, subd. (c)(1)). The trial court suspended imposition of sentence in\neach case and placed defendant on probation.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\f       While defendant was on probation, section 1170.18 was enacted by the voters as\npart of Proposition 47, which reclassified certain offenses as misdemeanors. Defendant\nfiled a petition in each case for recall of sentence and resentencing to a misdemeanor\nunder section 1170.18 with respect to his felony drug convictions. The trial court\nimplicitly determined that defendant, as a probationer, was not serving a sentence within\nthe meaning of section 1170.18. However, in order to sentence the drug convictions as\nmisdemeanors, the court proceeded to terminate probation in both cases, sentence\ndefendant to 16-month jail terms for his felony drug convictions, and then immediately\nrecall the sentences and resentence defendant to misdemeanors.\n       On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to automatically\ndesignate his felony drug convictions as misdemeanors. Defendant argues that the\nprovisions of Proposition 47 in reclassifying certain offenses as misdemeanors applied\nretroactively to him, and that the trial court erred in terminating probation and sentencing\nhim to felony jail terms before resentencing his drug offenses as misdemeanors.\n       For reasons that we will explain, we will order the vacation of the orders\nterminating probation and imposing felony sentences, and affirm the orders as so\nmodified.\n                 II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In February 2014, in case No. SS132528A, defendant was charged by information\nwith possession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a);\ncount 1), misdemeanor inflicting corporal injury on a spouse (§ 273.5, subd. (a); count 2),\nand misdemeanor child endangerment (§ 273a, subd. (b); count 3). In March 2014,\ndefendant pleaded no contest to counts 1 and 2.\n       In April 2014, in case No. SS140906A, defendant was charged by complaint with\npossession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a);\ncount 1), and misdemeanor violating a protective order (§ 166, subd. (c)(1); count 2).\nDefendant pleaded no contest to both counts.\n\n                                             2\n\f       At a combined sentencing hearing in May 2014, the trial court suspended\nimposition of sentence in each case and placed defendant on probation for three years\nwith various terms and conditions. The remaining count against defendant in case\nNo. SS132528A was dismissed.\n       Defendant thereafter filed an application in case No. SS140906A to have his\nfelony drug conviction designated as a misdemeanor under section 1170.18. Defendant\nlater withdrew the petition before the court ruled on it.\n       In the meantime, on October 15, 2014, defendant admitted violating probation in\nboth cases. On December 10, 2014, the trial court reinstated probation in both cases on\nmodified terms and conditions.\n       In mid-December 2014, defendant filed a petition in each case for recall of\nsentence and resentencing under section 1170.18. In the petitions, defendant stated\nthat he had been convicted of felony violations of former Health and Safety Code\nsections 11377 and those offenses had since been reclassified as misdemeanors.\nDefendant contended that he was “sentenced to” probation in each case, and that he\nwas “currently serving the . . . sentence” in each case. He requested that he be\nresentenced to misdemeanors.\n       In case No. SS140906A, the prosecutor filed a written response indicating that\ndefendant was not eligible for the requested relief because he was “on probation and\ntherefore no[t] serving a sentence.” In case No. SS132528A, a different prosecutor filed\na written response indicating that the prosecution had “no objection” to defendant’s\npetition and that defendant was “entitled to the requested relief.”\n       A hearing was held on the petitions on April 24, 2015. The trial court stated its\nunderstanding that the prosecution’s “objection was that [defendant] hadn’t been\nsentenced.” The court, in apparent agreement with the prosecution that defendant was\nnot serving a sentence within the meaning of section 1170.18, stated, “Typically I\nsentence to [the] lower term, recall the sentence and resentence as a misdemeanor.”\n\n                                              3\n\fDefense counsel responded, “Okay. That’s fine. If the Court wants to 17(b) it, I can also\nrequest that. But if the Court wants to do it the other way, I would just list my objections\nfor the record and submit it.” The court stated, “[D]oing it that way instead of the 17(b)\nhe could still be placed on parole for a year.” Defense counsel responded, “Correct.”\nDefense counsel later stated, “I’ll submit it to the Court with my objections.” The\nprosecution stated, “The Court correctly understands and stated the People’s position.”\n       The trial court proceeded to revoke and terminate probation in each case and\nsentence defendant to the lower term of 16 months in jail for his felony convictions under\nformer Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a). The court immediately\nrecalled the sentences and resentenced defendant to misdemeanors for the convictions.\nIn each case, the court denied probation and ordered defendant to serve 365 days in\ncounty jail with credit for time served of 365 days. Further, in case No. SS140906A,\nthe court placed defendant on parole for one year. In case No. SS132528A, the court\nreleased defendant from parole.\n       Defendant filed a notice of appeal from the April 24, 2015 order in each case.\n                                     III. DISCUSSION\n       A. Legal Background: Proposition 47\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act (the Act). (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\neff. Nov. 5, 2014.) Proposition 47 reclassified certain drug and theft related offenses as\nmisdemeanors instead of felonies or alternative felony misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (a); People v. Shabazz (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303, 308.) The statutes amended\nby Proposition 47 include Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a), the\nformer version of which provided the basis for defendant’s felony conviction in each\ncase. Prior to Proposition 47, possession of a controlled substance in violation of Health\nand Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a) was a wobbler. (People v. Lynall (2015)\n233 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1108.) As a result of Proposition 47, Health and Safety Code\n\n                                             4\n\fsection 11377, subdivision (a) now provides that possession of specified controlled\nsubstances is punishable as a misdemeanor unless the defendant has certain disqualifying\nprior convictions.2\n       Proposition 47 also enacted a new statutory provision, section 1170.18, which sets\nforth two different procedures for defendants seeking to have a felony conviction\nresentenced or designated as a misdemeanor.\n       The first procedure under section 1170.18 applies to a defendant who is “currently\nserving a sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been guilty of a\nmisdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the offense.\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (a), italics added.) Such a defendant may petition for a recall of his or\nher sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the amended statute that\nreclassified the defendant’s offense as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) If the petitioner meets the\nrequisite statutory criteria, “the petitioner’s felony sentence shall be recalled and the\npetitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (Id., subd. (b); see id., subd. (c).) Section 1170.18 sets forth various factors that\na court may consider in exercising its discretion. (Id., subd. (b)(1)-(3).) A defendant is\nnot eligible for resentencing if he or she has suffered a specified prior conviction. (Id.,\nsubd. (i).) Generally, a defendant who is resentenced pursuant to section 1170.18 is\nsubject to a one-year period of parole, unless the court as part of its resentencing order\n\n\n\n       2\n         Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a) provides for the following\npunishment: “imprisonment in a county jail for a period of not more than one year,\nexcept that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of\nSection 1170 of the Penal Code if that person has one or more prior convictions for an\noffense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e)\nof Section 667 of the Penal Code or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to\nsubdivision (c) of Section 290 of the Penal Code.”\n\n\n                                              5\n\freleases the defendant from parole, and the defendant continues to be subject to the ban\non firearms possession that is applicable to felons. (Id., subds. (d) & (k).)\n       The second procedure under section 1170.18 applies to a defendant who has\n“completed his or her sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been guilty\nof a misdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the offense.\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (f), italics added.) Such a person may file an application to have the\nfelony conviction designated a misdemeanor, and the trial court must make the\nmisdemeanor designation if the defendant meets the requisite criteria and has not suffered\na specified prior conviction. (Id., subds. (f), (g) & (i).)\n       On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by revoking his probation\nand imposing 16-month jail sentences in order to make him eligible for resentencing as a\nmisdemeanor under section 1170.18, subdivisions (a) and (b). Defendant argues that the\ntrial court should have instead retroactively applied Proposition 47’s reclassification of\nhis felony offenses as misdemeanors and automatically designated his felony convictions\nas misdemeanors. Defendant also contends that, as a probationer, he was not “currently\nserving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a). Defendant\nrequests that his probation revocations, parole requirement, and firearm bans be\n“stri[cken].”\n       The Attorney General contends that defendant was not entitled to an automatic\nreduction of his felonies to misdemeanors. The Attorney General also contends that the\ntrial court erred in determining that defendant, as probationer, was not currently serving a\nsentence within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a). The Attorney General\nargues that the court nevertheless granted defendant the relief he sought, that is,\nresentencing of the felony convictions to misdemeanors, and that the judgments should\ntherefore be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f       We will first consider the issue of retroactivity before turning to the question of\nwhether the procedure set forth in section 1170.18, subdivision (a) was applicable to\ndefendant in order to be resentenced to misdemeanors.\n       B. Retroactivity\n                                   1. Legal background\n       Section 3 specifies that no part of the Penal Code is retroactive, “unless expressly\nso declared.” Section 3 “provides the default rule” regarding retroactivity, “codifying\n‘the time-honored principle . . . that in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a\nstatute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that\nthe Legislature [or electorate] . . . must have intended a retroactive application.’\n[Citations.]” (People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319 (Brown).)\n       A “qualification” to the prospective-only presumption regarding statutory\namendments was set forth in In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 (Estrada). (Brown,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 323.) That qualification is: “When the Legislature [or electorate]\nhas amended a statute to reduce the punishment for a particular criminal offense, we will\nassume, absent evidence to the contrary, that the Legislature [or electorate] intended the\namended statute to apply to all defendants whose judgments are not yet final on the\nstatute’s operative date. [Citation.]” (Ibid., fn. omitted.) As the Estrada court explained:\n“When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment[,] it has obviously\nexpressly determined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment\nis proper as punishment for the commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable\ninference that the Legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new\nlighter penalty now deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\nconstitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be\napplied constitutionally to acts committed before its passage provided the judgment\nconvicting the defendant of the act is not final.” (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       In In re May (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 165 (May), the appellate court addressed the\napplication of Estrada and the issue of when a judgment is final for a defendant placed\non probation. In May, the “proceedings in the case were suspended and [the defendant]\nwas placed on probation” for a drug offense. (Id. at p. 167.) A statutory amendment\nsubsequently reduced the offense from a felony to a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) In the\ndefendant’s case, however, the trial court continued to treat the offense as a felony when\nthe defendant was later found in violation of probation. (Id. at pp. 167-168.) The\nappellate court determined that, “[s]ince the proceedings were suspended, no final\njudgment was entered for the purposes of this case. [Citations.] Thus, the rationale of\nEstrada applies to this case because the amendatory statute became effective after the\ncommission of the act but before the judgment of conviction was final.” (Id. at p. 169.)\nThe appellate court therefore concluded that the defendant’s offense should be designated\nand treated as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.)\n       “The rule in Estrada, of course, is not implicated where the Legislature clearly\nsignals its intent to make the amendment prospective, by the inclusion of either an\nexpress saving clause or its equivalent.” (People v. Nasalga (1996) 12 Cal.4th 784, 793,\nfn. omitted (Nasalga) (plur. opn. of Werdegar, J.); see Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 747\n[“where there is an express or implied saving clause,” the prior statute “should continue\nto operate as to past acts”].) If there is no express saving clause, one will be implied if\nthe Legislature or electorate has “demonstrate[d] its intention with sufficient clarity that a\nreviewing court can discern and effectuate it.” (In re Pedro T. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1041,\n1049 (Pedro T.).)\n       For example, the “functional equivalent of a saving clause” was included in\nProposition 36, the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the Reform Act). (People v.\nYearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 172 (Yearwood).) The Reform Act “change[d]\nthe requirements for sentencing a third strike offender” by authorizing life sentences only\nin certain cases. (Yearwood, supra, at p. 167.) The Reform Act also enacted a new\n\n                                              8\n\fstatute, section 1170.126, which “created a postconviction release proceeding whereby\n[an eligible] prisoner . . . may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a\nsecond strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. [Citation.]” (Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.)\n       The Yearwood defendant was sentenced as a third strike offender prior to the\nReform Act. (Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 167.) Had he been sentenced after\nthe Reform Act, he would not have been sentenced to an indeterminate life term.\n(Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.) The appellate court considered whether it could issue an\norder that he be resentenced, or whether his remedy was “limited to filing a petition for a\nrecall of his sentence in compliance with section 1170.126.” (Ibid.)\n       The Yearwood defendant argued that the Reform Act should apply retroactively,\nbased on Estrada, because the Reform Act reduced the punishment for his offense. The\nYearwood court disagreed, finding that “[t]he Estrada rule does not apply to the [Reform]\nAct because section 1170.126 operates as the functional equivalent of a saving clause.”\n(Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 172.) The court examined the language of\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (b), which provides, “Any person serving an indeterminate\nterm of life imprisonment” imposed for a third strike conviction “may file a petition for a\nrecall of sentence.” The court found this phrase was “not ambiguous” and that\nsection 1170.126 “is correctly interpreted to apply to all prisoners serving an\nindeterminate life sentence imposed under the former three strikes law.” (Yearwood,\nsupra, at p. 175.)\n       On June 30, 2016, the California Supreme Court similarly held that third strike\ndefendants who were sentenced prior to the effective date of the Reform Act, but whose\njudgments were not yet final as of that date, “are not entitled to automatic resentencing,\nbut instead may seek resentencing by petitioning for recall of sentence under\nsection 1170.126.” (People v. Conley (2016) 63 Cal.4th 646, 652 (Conley).) Among the\ncourt’s reasons in reaching this conclusion was the fact that “the Reform Act is not silent\n\n                                             9\n\fon the question of retroactivity.” (Id. at p. 657.) Rather, “[s]ection 1170.126 creates a\nspecial mechanism that entitles all persons ‘presently serving’ indeterminate life terms\nimposed under the prior law to seek resentencing under the new law. By its terms, the\nprovision draws no distinction between persons serving final sentences and those serving\nnonfinal sentences, entitling both categories of prisoners to petition courts for recall of\nsentence under the Act.” (Ibid.; see § 1170.126, subd. (a).)\n       The California Supreme Court further explained that “[t]he recall procedures in\nPenal Code section 1170.126 were designed to strike a balance between [the] objectives\nof mitigating punishment and protecting public safety by creating a resentencing\nmechanism for persons serving indeterminate life terms under the former Three Strikes\nlaw, but making resentencing subject to the trial court’s evaluation of whether, based on\ntheir criminal history, their record of incarceration, and other relevant considerations,\ntheir early release would pose an ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.’\n[Citation.]” (Conley, supra, 63 Cal.4th at p. 658.) The California Supreme Court\n“[could] discern no basis to conclude that the electorate would have intended for courts to\nbypass the public safety inquiry altogether in the case of defendants serving sentences\nthat are not yet final.” (Id. at p. 659.) Lastly, the court reasoned that the Reform Act did\nnot address certain procedural complexities, regarding the pleading and proof of new\ndisqualifying factors, which would arise if the Reform Act automatically applied to\npreviously sentenced defendants, because voters intended for such defendants to instead\nfollow the petition process which did not implicate those procedural complexities. (Id. at\npp. 659-661.)\n                                        2. Analysis\n       Defendant contends that he was automatically entitled to relief under\nProposition 47 and the resulting statutory amendment that changed his drug offenses\nfrom felonies to misdemeanors.\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       The question of whether retroactive application of Proposition 47’s reduced\npenalty provisions is required under Estrada requires a determination of the intent of the\nelectorate (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 744), which may be signaled by the inclusion\nof “either an express saving clause or its equivalent” (Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at\np. 793; see Estrada, supra, at p. 747).\n       We determine that although Proposition 47 does not have an express saving\nclause, it did create section 1170.18, which is functionally equivalent to a saving clause.\n(See Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 793; Pedro T., supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 1049; Estrada,\nsupra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 747.) In enacting Proposition 47, the electorate drew distinctions\nbetween three categories of defendants—those who had not yet been sentenced, those\nwho were “currently serving” sentences (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), and those who had\ncompleted their sentences (id., subd. (f))—and it provided procedures for those latter two\ncategories of defendants who sought to benefit from the ameliorative provisions provided\nby Proposition 47. In particular, under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a defendant who\nis “currently serving a sentence for a conviction” may petition for a recall of sentence and\nresentencing. Like the resentencing petition process created by the Reform Act, the\nresentencing petition process contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (a) expressly\napplies to defendants who are “currently serving a sentence” for a crime that would have\nbeen a misdemeanor after the passage of Proposition 47. (Cf. § 1170.126, subds. (a) &\n(b); see Conley, supra, 63 Cal.4th at pp. 657-658; Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at\np. 173.) Further, like the resentencing process created by the Reform Act, the\nresentencing process contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (b) makes resentencing\nsubject to the trial court’s evaluation of whether resentencing the defendant “would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Cf. § 1170.126, subd. (f); see Conley,\nsupra, at pp. 658-659; Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 176.) By setting forth a\nspecific procedure for those defendants who were “currently serving a sentence” at the\ntime the initiative took effect and in view of the nature of that procedure (§ 1170.18,\n\n                                             11\n\fsubd. (a); see id., subd. (b)), the electorate effectively and clearly “demonstrate[d] its\nintention” that such defendants follow those procedures set forth in section 1170.18\nbefore being resentenced (Pedro T., supra, at p. 1049).3\n       We therefore turn to the question of whether defendant is “currently serving a\nsentence” (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), such that the recall and resentencing procedure set forth\nin section 1170.18 applies to him. (See, e.g., id., subds. (a) - (d).)\n       C. “Currently Serving a Sentence”\n       Defendant contends that, because the imposition of his sentence was suspended in\neach case and he was placed on probation (see § 1203, subd. (a)), he was not “currently\nserving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a). The Attorney\nGeneral contends that defendant, as a probationer, was “currently serving a sentence”\nwithin the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n       “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, [1] “we turn first to the language of the statute,\ngiving the words their ordinary meaning.” [Citation.] [2] The statutory language must\nalso be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme\n[in light of the electorate’s intent]. [Citation.] [3] When the language is ambiguous,\n“we refer to other indicia of the voters’ intent, particularly the analyses and arguments\ncontained in the official ballot pamphlet.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.] [¶] In other words,\nour ‘task is simply to interpret and apply the initiative’s language so as to effectuate the\n\n\n\n       3\n         In People v. Davis (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 127 (Davis), review granted July 13,\n2016, S234324, the appellate court similarly concluded that, for defendants who were\ncurrently serving a sentence or who had completed a sentence for a felony covered by\nProposition 47, “the electorate made clear its intent as to the nature and extent of the\nretroactive application of the amendments. For those persons, there is no need, and no\nplace, for inferences about retroactive application, and therefore no basis for invoking\nEstrada.” (Davis, supra, at p. 137.)\n\n\n                                              12\n\felectorate’s intent.’ [Citation.]” (Robert L. v. Superior Court (2003) 30 Cal.4th 894,\n900-901.)\n       In People v. Garcia (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 555 (Garcia), we determined that the\nphrase “currently serving a sentence” in section 1170.18, subdivision (a), “appl[ies] to all\nthose with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who otherwise meet\nthe conditions specified in the statutory scheme.” (Garcia, supra, at p. 559.)4 In Garcia,\nas in the instant case, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed the\ndefendant on probation for felony possession of a controlled substance (former Health &\nSaf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)). (Garcia, supra, at p. 557.)\n       We agreed with the parties in Garcia that interpreting the statutory language to\nnot include probationers would lead to absurd consequences. We observed that “there is\nnothing in either the ballot materials or the statutory language that appears to limit the\nphrase ‘currently serving a sentence for a conviction’ to those serving a term of\nimprisonment.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at p. 558.) Moreover, “granting\nprobation is in some contexts a ‘sentencing choice’ (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 4.405(6) [‘ “Sentence choice” means the selection of any disposition of the case\nthat does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial.’]). (Cf. People v.\nHoward (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1081, 1084 [referring to court’s authority ‘at time of\nsentencing’ either to suspend imposition of sentence or impose sentence and suspend its\nexecution]; In re DeLong (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 562, 571 [‘an order granting probation\nand suspending imposition of sentence is a form of sentencing’].)” (Ibid.) Indeed, “the\nlanguage of another voter initiative, Proposition 36, the Substance Abuse and Crime\nPrevention Act of 2000, used the language ‘sentenced to probation.’ (See People v.\n\n\n       4\n        In Davis, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at pages 132 and 143, review granted, the\nappellate court similarly concluded that probationers fall within the meaning of section\n1170.18, subdivision (a).\n\n\n                                             13\n\fMendoza (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1034 [quoting ballot pamphlet to distinguish\nconviction from sentence and referring to ‘sentence of probation’].)” (Ibid.)\n       We explained in Garcia that “[t]he ballot materials for Proposition 47 likewise\nindicate that the voters regarded probation as one of the options within a sentencing\nprocedure; the legislative analysis refers to offenders who are ‘sentenced’ to supervision\nby a county probation officer while indicating that both jail time for eligible offenders\nand the caseloads of probation officers would be reduced by including felony probation\nas a disposition eligible for resentencing under section 1170.18. (See People v. Shabazz\n(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303, 310 [discussing Prop. 47 mechanism for resentencing after\nbeing ‘sentenced or placed on probation’].) The Legislative Analyst discussed these\noptions under the heading of ‘Misdemeanor Sentencing’ and generally noted the fiscal\nconsequences of ‘the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies\nthat are changed to misdemeanors.’ (Italics added.) Nothing in the text of the initiative,\nthe legislative analysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to\ndistinguish between a prison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of\nprobation after suspending imposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but\nsuspending its execution. The statute itself allows the recall of a ‘felony sentence’ and\nallows the petitioner to request ‘resentencing’ in Health and Safety Code section 11377\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) . . . Proposition 47 was intended to reach those with\n‘nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,’ which would encompass many\nwho were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide, [Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014)]\ntext of Prop. 47, § 3, p. 70.) To deprive those defendants of the benefit of the reduced\npenalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either\nanticipated or approved.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559, fns. omitted.)\n       Defendant fails to persuade us that Garcia is distinguishable from his case or that\nwe should otherwise not follow Garcia.\n\n                                              14\n\f       Defendant argues that, because section 1170.18, subdivision (a) authorizes a\npetition for recall of sentence from the trial court that entered the “judgment of\nconviction,” subdivision (a) does not apply to a probationer whose imposition of sentence\nhas been suspended because no such judgment has been entered. However, section 1237,\nsubdivision (a), which governs criminal appeals, provides that a “final judgment of\nconviction” includes an order granting probation.\n       Defendant also argues that applying the procedures set forth in section 1170.18 to\nprobationers “is inconsistent with the voters’ intent in passing Proposition 47.” For\nexample, according to defendant, probation is only granted to those defendants who pose\nminimal risk to public safety, so requiring a trial court to assess those defendants’ risk to\npublic safety under section 1170.18, subdivisions (b) and (c) is “redundant” and\nsubjecting those defendants to a parole requirement undermines the purpose of\nProposition 47 “by diminishing the financial resources.”\n       We are not persuaded by defendant’s arguments. Some of the provisions in\nsection 1170.18 may be more appropriately applied to one defendant over another\ndefendant, whether those two defendants are both in prison, both on probation, or one in\nprison and one on probation. The provisions of section 1170.18 are not inconsistent with\nan intent by the electorate to include probationers within the recall/resentencing\nprocedures. For example, that a court may be more likely to have public safety concerns\nwhen a recall petition is brought by a defendant in prison as compared to a petition\nbrought by a probationer, does not suggest that the electorate intended to allow a recall\npetition by a prisoner only and not by a probationer.\n       D. Summary\n       Defendant, who was on probation, sought to have his felony drug convictions\ndesignated misdemeanors. The trial court apparently determined that defendant had\nnot yet been sentenced, and that therefore none of the procedures provided by\nsection 1170.18 was available to defendant while he was on probation. The court\n\n                                             15\n\fconsequently revoked and terminated defendant’s probation, sentenced him to 16 months\nin jail in each case, immediately recalled the sentences, and resentenced defendant to\nmisdemeanors for the drug convictions.\n       However, as we explained in Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th 555, which was filed\nafter the hearing on defendant’s petitions for resentencing in this case, defendant was\n“currently serving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a) at\nthe time he was on probation. Therefore, the trial court could have properly considered\ndefendant’s petition for recall and resentencing under subdivision (a) without terminating\nhis probation and imposing a felony sentence in each case.\n       Although defendant ultimately obtained the relief to which he was entitled under\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (b), that is, resentencing to a misdemeanor for each of his\neligible felony convictions, he contends his claims on appeal are not moot and that there\nmay be collateral consequences as a result of the trial court’s procedure in revoking\nprobation and imposing felony sentences. At oral argument, defendant and the Attorney\nGeneral agreed that the proper remedy would be to strike the trial court’s orders revoking\nprobation and imposing felony sentences. Accordingly, we will vacate the trial court’s\norders in these respects and affirm the orders as so modified.\n                                   IV. DISPOSITION\n       In case No. SS132528A, the order of April 24, 2015 is ordered modified by\nvacating: (1) the order revoking and terminating probation, and (2) the order imposing a\n16-month felony sentence.

INTRODUCTION\n         In case No. SS132528A, defendant Pete Calderon Valdez, Sr., pleaded no contest\nto possession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a))\nand misdemeanor inflicting corporal injury on a spouse (Pen. Code, § 273.5, subd. (a)).1\nIn case No. SS140906A, defendant pleaded no contest to possession of a controlled\nsubstance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)) and misdemeanor violating a\nprotective order (§ 166, subd. (c)(1)). The trial court suspended imposition of sentence in\neach case and placed defendant on probation.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\f       While defendant was on probation, section 1170.18 was enacted by the voters as\npart of Proposition 47, which reclassified certain offenses as misdemeanors. Defendant\nfiled a petition in each case for recall of sentence and resentencing to a misdemeanor\nunder section 1170.18 with respect to his felony drug convictions. The trial court\nimplicitly determined that defendant, as a probationer, was not serving a sentence within\nthe meaning of section 1170.18. However, in order to sentence the drug convictions as\nmisdemeanors, the court proceeded to terminate probation in both cases, sentence\ndefendant to 16-month jail terms for his felony drug convictions, and then immediately\nrecall the sentences and resentence defendant to misdemeanors.\n       On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to automatically\ndesignate his felony drug convictions as misdemeanors. Defendant argues that the\nprovisions of Proposition 47 in reclassifying certain offenses as misdemeanors applied\nretroactively to him, and that the trial court erred in terminating probation and sentencing\nhim to felony jail terms before resentencing his drug offenses as misdemeanors.\n       For reasons that we will explain, we will order the vacation of the orders\nterminating probation and imposing felony sentences, and affirm the orders as so\nmodified.\n                 II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       In February 2014, in case No. SS132528A, defendant was charged by information\nwith possession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a);\ncount 1), misdemeanor inflicting corporal injury on a spouse (§ 273.5, subd. (a); count 2),\nand misdemeanor child endangerment (§ 273a, subd. (b); count 3). In March 2014,\ndefendant pleaded no contest to counts 1 and 2.\n       In April 2014, in case No. SS140906A, defendant was charged by complaint with\npossession of a controlled substance (former Health & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a);\ncount 1), and misdemeanor violating a protective order (§ 166, subd. (c)(1); count 2).\nDefendant pleaded no contest to both counts.\n\n                                             2\n\f       At a combined sentencing hearing in May 2014, the trial court suspended\nimposition of sentence in each case and placed defendant on probation for three years\nwith various terms and conditions. The remaining count against defendant in case\nNo. SS132528A was dismissed.\n       Defendant thereafter filed an application in case No. SS140906A to have his\nfelony drug conviction designated as a misdemeanor under section 1170.18. Defendant\nlater withdrew the petition before the court ruled on it.\n       In the meantime, on October 15, 2014, defendant admitted violating probation in\nboth cases. On December 10, 2014, the trial court reinstated probation in both cases on\nmodified terms and conditions.\n       In mid-December 2014, defendant filed a petition in each case for recall of\nsentence and resentencing under section 1170.18. In the petitions, defendant stated\nthat he had been convicted of felony violations of former Health and Safety Code\nsections 11377 and those offenses had since been reclassified as misdemeanors.\nDefendant contended that he was “sentenced to” probation in each case, and that he\nwas “currently serving the . . . sentence” in each case. He requested that he be\nresentenced to misdemeanors.\n       In case No. SS140906A, the prosecutor filed a written response indicating that\ndefendant was not eligible for the requested relief because he was “on probation and\ntherefore no[t] serving a sentence.” In case No. SS132528A, a different prosecutor filed\na written response indicating that the prosecution had “no objection” to defendant’s\npetition and that defendant was “entitled to the requested relief.”\n       A hearing was held on the petitions on April 24, 2015. The trial court stated its\nunderstanding that the prosecution’s “objection was that [defendant] hadn’t been\nsentenced.” The court, in apparent agreement with the prosecution that defendant was\nnot serving a sentence within the meaning of section 1170.18, stated, “Typically I\nsentence to [the] lower term, recall the sentence and resentence as a misdemeanor.”\n\n                                              3\n\fDefense counsel responded, “Okay. That’s fine. If the Court wants to 17(b) it, I can also\nrequest that. But if the Court wants to do it the other way, I would just list my objections\nfor the record and submit it.” The court stated, “[D]oing it that way instead of the 17(b)\nhe could still be placed on parole for a year.” Defense counsel responded, “Correct.”\nDefense counsel later stated, “I’ll submit it to the Court with my objections.” The\nprosecution stated, “The Court correctly understands and stated the People’s position.”\n       The trial court proceeded to revoke and terminate probation in each case and\nsentence defendant to the lower term of 16 months in jail for his felony convictions under\nformer Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a). The court immediately\nrecalled the sentences and resentenced defendant to misdemeanors for the convictions.\nIn each case, the court denied probation and ordered defendant to serve 365 days in\ncounty jail with credit for time served of 365 days. Further, in case No. SS140906A,\nthe court placed defendant on parole for one year. In case No. SS132528A, the court\nreleased defendant from parole.\n       Defendant filed a notice of appeal from the April 24, 2015 order in each case.\n                                     III. DISCUSSION\n       A. Legal Background: Proposition 47\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act (the Act). (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\neff. Nov. 5, 2014.) Proposition 47 reclassified certain drug and theft related offenses as\nmisdemeanors instead of felonies or alternative felony misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (a); People v. Shabazz (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308.) The statutes amended\nby Proposition 47 include Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a), the\nformer version of which provided the basis for defendant’s felony conviction in each\ncase. Prior to Proposition 47, possession of a controlled substance in violation of Health\nand Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a) was a wobbler. (People v. Lynall (2015)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1108.) As a result of Proposition 47, Health and Safety Code\n\n                                             4\n\fsection 11377, subdivision (a) now provides that possession of specified controlled\nsubstances is punishable as a misdemeanor unless the defendant has certain disqualifying\nprior convictions.2\n       Proposition 47 also enacted a new statutory provision, section 1170.18, which sets\nforth two different procedures for defendants seeking to have a felony conviction\nresentenced or designated as a misdemeanor.\n       The first procedure under section 1170.18 applies to a defendant who is “currently\nserving a sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been guilty of a\nmisdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the offense.\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (a), italics added.) Such a defendant may petition for a recall of his or\nher sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the amended statute that\nreclassified the defendant’s offense as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) If the petitioner meets the\nrequisite statutory criteria, “the petitioner’s felony sentence shall be recalled and the\npetitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (Id., subd. (b); see id., subd. (c).) Section 1170.18 sets forth various factors that\na court may consider in exercising its discretion. (Id., subd. (b)(1)-(3).) A defendant is\nnot eligible for resentencing if he or she has suffered a specified prior conviction. (Id.,\nsubd. (i).) Generally, a defendant who is resentenced pursuant to section 1170.18 is\nsubject to a one-year period of parole, unless the court as part of its resentencing order\n\n\n\n       2\n         Health and Safety Code section 11377, subdivision (a) provides for the following\npunishment: “imprisonment in a county jail for a period of not more than one year,\nexcept that such person may instead be punished pursuant to subdivision (h) of\nSection 1170 of the Penal Code if that person has one or more prior convictions for an\noffense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e)\nof Section 667 of the Penal Code or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to\nsubdivision (c) of Section 290 of the Penal Code.”\n\n\n                                              5\n\freleases the defendant from parole, and the defendant continues to be subject to the ban\non firearms possession that is applicable to felons. (Id., subds. (d) & (k).)\n       The second procedure under section 1170.18 applies to a defendant who has\n“completed his or her sentence” for a felony conviction and who would have been guilty\nof a misdemeanor under the Act if the Act had been in effect at the time of the offense.\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (f), italics added.) Such a person may file an application to have the\nfelony conviction designated a misdemeanor, and the trial court must make the\nmisdemeanor designation if the defendant meets the requisite criteria and has not suffered\na specified prior conviction. (Id., subds. (f), (g) & (i).)\n       On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by revoking his probation\nand imposing 16-month jail sentences in order to make him eligible for resentencing as a\nmisdemeanor under section 1170.18, subdivisions (a) and (b). Defendant argues that the\ntrial court should have instead retroactively applied Proposition 47’s reclassification of\nhis felony offenses as misdemeanors and automatically designated his felony convictions\nas misdemeanors. Defendant also contends that, as a probationer, he was not “currently\nserving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a). Defendant\nrequests that his probation revocations, parole requirement, and firearm bans be\n“stri[cken].”\n       The Attorney General contends that defendant was not entitled to an automatic\nreduction of his felonies to misdemeanors. The Attorney General also contends that the\ntrial court erred in determining that defendant, as probationer, was not currently serving a\nsentence within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a). The Attorney General\nargues that the court nevertheless granted defendant the relief he sought, that is,\nresentencing of the felony convictions to misdemeanors, and that the judgments should\ntherefore be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f       We will first consider the issue of retroactivity before turning to the question of\nwhether the procedure set forth in section 1170.18, subdivision (a) was applicable to\ndefendant in order to be resentenced to misdemeanors.\n       B. Retroactivity\n                                   1. Legal background\n       Section 3 specifies that no part of the Penal Code is retroactive, “unless expressly\nso declared.” Section 3 “provides the default rule” regarding retroactivity, “codifying\n‘the time-honored principle . . . that in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a\nstatute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that\nthe Legislature [or electorate] . . . must have intended a retroactive application.’\n[Citations.]” (People v.

(Brown,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 323.) That qualification is: “When the Legislature [or electorate]\nhas amended a statute to reduce the punishment for a particular criminal offense, we will\nassume, absent evidence to the contrary, that the Legislature [or electorate] intended the\namended statute to apply to all defendants whose judgments are not yet final on the\nstatute’s operative date. [Citation.]” (Ibid., fn. omitted.) As the Estrada court explained:\n“When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment[,] it has obviously\nexpressly determined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment\nis proper as punishment for the commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable\ninference that the Legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new\nlighter penalty now deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\nconstitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be\napplied constitutionally to acts committed before its passage provided the judgment\nconvicting the defendant of the act is not final.” (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       In In re May (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106564\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106564/in-re-may/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (May), the appellate court addressed the\napplication of Estrada and the issue of when a judgment is final for a defendant placed\non probation. In May, the “proceedings in the case were suspended and [the defendant]\nwas placed on probation” for a drug offense. (Id. at p. 167.) A statutory amendment\nsubsequently reduced the offense from a felony to a misdemeanor. (Ibid.) In the\ndefendant’s case, however, the trial court continued to treat the offense as a felony when\nthe defendant was later found in violation of probation. (Id. at pp. 167-168.) The\nappellate court determined that, “[s]ince the proceedings were suspended, no final\njudgment was entered for the purposes of this case. [Citations.] Thus, the rationale of\nEstrada applies to this case because the amendatory statute became effective after the\ncommission of the act but before the judgment of conviction was final.” (Id. at p. 169.)\nThe appellate court therefore concluded that the defendant’s offense should be designated\nand treated as a misdemeanor. (Ibid.)\n       “The rule in Estrada, of course, is not implicated where the Legislature clearly\nsignals its intent to make the amendment prospective, by the inclusion of either an\nexpress saving clause or its equivalent.” (People v.

If there is no express saving clause, one will be implied if\nthe Legislature or electorate has “demonstrate[d] its intention with sufficient clarity that a\nreviewing court can discern and effectuate it.” (In re Pedro T.

(People v.\nYearwood (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172 (Yearwood).) The Reform Act “change[d]\nthe requirements for sentencing a third strike offender” by authorizing life sentences only\nin certain cases. (Yearwood, supra, at p. 167.) The Reform Act also enacted a new\n\n                                              8\n\fstatute, section 1170.126, which “created a postconviction release proceeding whereby\n[an eligible] prisoner . . . may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a\nsecond strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. [Citation.]” (Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.)\n       The Yearwood defendant was sentenced as a third strike offender prior to the\nReform Act. (Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 167.) Had he been sentenced after\nthe Reform Act, he would not have been sentenced to an indeterminate life term.\n(Yearwood, supra, at p. 168.) The appellate court considered whether it could issue an\norder that he be resentenced, or whether his remedy was “limited to filing a petition for a\nrecall of his sentence in compliance with section 1170.126.” (Ibid.)\n       The Yearwood defendant argued that the Reform Act should apply retroactively,\nbased on Estrada, because the Reform Act reduced the punishment for his offense. The\nYearwood court disagreed, finding that “[t]he Estrada rule does not apply to the [Reform]\nAct because section 1170.126 operates as the functional equivalent of a saving clause.”\n(Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 172.) The court examined the language of\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (b), which provides, “Any person serving an indeterminate\nterm of life imprisonment” imposed for a third strike conviction “may file a petition for a\nrecall of sentence.” The court found this phrase was “not ambiguous” and that\nsection 1170.126 “is correctly interpreted to apply to all prisoners serving an\nindeterminate life sentence imposed under the former three strikes law.” (Yearwood,\nsupra, at p. 175.)\n       On June 30, 2016, the California Supreme Court similarly held that third strike\ndefendants who were sentenced prior to the effective date of the Reform Act, but whose\njudgments were not yet final as of that date, “are not entitled to automatic resentencing,\nbut instead may seek resentencing by petitioning for recall of sentence under\nsection 1170.126.” (People v. Conley (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 652 (Conley).) Among the\ncourt’s reasons in reaching this conclusion was the fact that “the Reform Act is not silent\n\n                                             9\n\fon the question of retroactivity.” (Id. at p. 657.) Rather, “[s]ection 1170.126 creates a\nspecial mechanism that entitles all persons ‘presently serving’ indeterminate life terms\nimposed under the prior law to seek resentencing under the new law. By its terms, the\nprovision draws no distinction between persons serving final sentences and those serving\nnonfinal sentences, entitling both categories of prisoners to petition courts for recall of\nsentence under the Act.” (Ibid.; see § 1170.126, subd. (a).)\n       The California Supreme Court further explained that “[t]he recall procedures in\nPenal Code section 1170.126 were designed to strike a balance between [the] objectives\nof mitigating punishment and protecting public safety by creating a resentencing\nmechanism for persons serving indeterminate life terms under the former Three Strikes\nlaw, but making resentencing subject to the trial court’s evaluation of whether, based on\ntheir criminal history, their record of incarceration, and other relevant considerations,\ntheir early release would pose an ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.’\n[Citation.]” (Conley, supra, 63 Cal.4th at p. 658.) The California Supreme Court\n“[could] discern no basis to conclude that the electorate would have intended for courts to\nbypass the public safety inquiry altogether in the case of defendants serving sentences\nthat are not yet final.” (Id. at p. 659.) Lastly, the court reasoned that the Reform Act did\nnot address certain procedural complexities, regarding the pleading and proof of new\ndisqualifying factors, which would arise if the Reform Act automatically applied to\npreviously sentenced defendants, because voters intended for such defendants to instead\nfollow the petition process which did not implicate those procedural complexities. (Id. at\npp. 659-661.)\n                                        2. Analysis\n       Defendant contends that he was automatically entitled to relief under\nProposition 47 and the resulting statutory amendment that changed his drug offenses\nfrom felonies to misdemeanors.\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       The question of whether retroactive application of Proposition 47’s reduced\npenalty provisions is required under Estrada requires a determination of the intent of the\nelectorate (Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 744), which may be signaled by the inclusion\nof “either an express saving clause or its equivalent” (Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at\np. 793; see Estrada, supra, at p. 747).\n       We determine that although Proposition 47 does not have an express saving\nclause, it did create section 1170.18, which is functionally equivalent to a saving clause.\n(See Nasalga, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 793; Pedro T., supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 1049; Estrada,\nsupra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 747.) In enacting Proposition 47, the electorate drew distinctions\nbetween three categories of defendants—those who had not yet been sentenced, those\nwho were “currently serving” sentences (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), and those who had\ncompleted their sentences (id., subd. (f))—and it provided procedures for those latter two\ncategories of defendants who sought to benefit from the ameliorative provisions provided\nby Proposition 47. In particular, under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a defendant who\nis “currently serving a sentence for a conviction” may petition for a recall of sentence and\nresentencing. Like the resentencing petition process created by the Reform Act, the\nresentencing petition process contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (a) expressly\napplies to defendants who are “currently serving a sentence” for a crime that would have\nbeen a misdemeanor after the passage of Proposition 47. (Cf. § 1170.126, subds. (a) &\n(b); see Conley, supra, 63 Cal.4th at pp. 657-658; Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at\np. 173.) Further, like the resentencing process created by the Reform Act, the\nresentencing process contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (b) makes resentencing\nsubject to the trial court’s evaluation of whether resentencing the defendant “would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Cf. § 1170.126, subd. (f); see Conley,\nsupra, at pp. 658-659; Yearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 176.) By setting forth a\nspecific procedure for those defendants who were “currently serving a sentence” at the\ntime the initiative took effect and in view of the nature of that procedure (§ 1170.18,\n\n                                             11\n\fsubd. (a); see id., subd. (b)), the electorate effectively and clearly “demonstrate[d] its\nintention” that such defendants follow those procedures set forth in section 1170.18\nbefore being resentenced (Pedro T., supra, at p. 1049).3\n       We therefore turn to the question of whether defendant is “currently serving a\nsentence” (§ 1170.18, subd. (a)), such that the recall and resentencing procedure set forth\nin section 1170.18 applies to him. (See, e.g., id., subds. (a) - (d).)\n       C. “Currently Serving a Sentence”\n       Defendant contends that, because the imposition of his sentence was suspended in\neach case and he was placed on probation (see § 1203, subd. (a)), he was not “currently\nserving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a). The Attorney\nGeneral contends that defendant, as a probationer, was “currently serving a sentence”\nwithin the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a).\n       “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction.

Moreover, “granting\nprobation is in some contexts a ‘sentencing choice’ (see, e.g., Cal.

(See People v. Shabazz\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The Legislative Analyst discussed these\noptions under the heading of ‘Misdemeanor Sentencing’ and generally noted the fiscal\nconsequences of ‘the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies\nthat are changed to misdemeanors.’ (Italics added.) Nothing in the text of the initiative,\nthe legislative analysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to\ndistinguish between a prison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of\nprobation after suspending imposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but\nsuspending its execution. The statute itself allows the recall of a ‘felony sentence’ and\nallows the petitioner to request ‘resentencing’ in Health and Safety Code section 11377\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) . . . Proposition 47 was intended to reach those with\n‘nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,’ which would encompass many\nwho were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide, [Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014)]\ntext of Prop. 47, § 3, p. 70.) To deprive those defendants of the benefit of the reduced\npenalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters would not have either\nanticipated or approved.” (Garcia, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at pp. 558-559, fns. omitted.)\n       Defendant fails to persuade us that Garcia is distinguishable from his case or that\nwe should otherwise not follow Garcia.\n\n                                              14\n\f       Defendant argues that, because section 1170.18, subdivision (a) authorizes a\npetition for recall of sentence from the trial court that entered the “judgment of\nconviction,” subdivision (a) does not apply to a probationer whose imposition of sentence\nhas been suspended because no such judgment has been entered. However, section 1237,\nsubdivision (a), which governs criminal appeals, provides that a “final judgment of\nconviction” includes an order granting probation.\n       Defendant also argues that applying the procedures set forth in section 1170.18 to\nprobationers “is inconsistent with the voters’ intent in passing Proposition 47.” For\nexample, according to defendant, probation is only granted to those defendants who pose\nminimal risk to public safety, so requiring a trial court to assess those defendants’ risk to\npublic safety under section 1170.18, subdivisions (b) and (c) is “redundant” and\nsubjecting those defendants to a parole requirement undermines the purpose of\nProposition 47 “by diminishing the financial resources.”\n       We are not persuaded by defendant’s arguments. Some of the provisions in\nsection 1170.18 may be more appropriately applied to one defendant over another\ndefendant, whether those two defendants are both in prison, both on probation, or one in\nprison and one on probation. The provisions of section 1170.18 are not inconsistent with\nan intent by the electorate to include probationers within the recall/resentencing\nprocedures. For example, that a court may be more likely to have public safety concerns\nwhen a recall petition is brought by a defendant in prison as compared to a petition\nbrought by a probationer, does not suggest that the electorate intended to allow a recall\npetition by a prisoner only and not by a probationer.\n       D. Summary\n       Defendant, who was on probation, sought to have his felony drug convictions\ndesignated misdemeanors. The trial court apparently determined that defendant had\nnot yet been sentenced, and that therefore none of the procedures provided by\nsection 1170.18 was available to defendant while he was on probation. The court\n\n                                             15\n\fconsequently revoked and terminated defendant’s probation, sentenced him to 16 months\nin jail in each case, immediately recalled the sentences, and resentenced defendant to\nmisdemeanors for the drug convictions.\n       However, as we explained in Garcia, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which was filed\nafter the hearing on defendant’s petitions for resentencing in this case, defendant was\n“currently serving a sentence” within the meaning of section 1170.18, subdivision (a) at\nthe time he was on probation. Therefore, the trial court could have properly considered\ndefendant’s petition for recall and resentencing under subdivision (a) without terminating\nhis probation and imposing a felony sentence in each case.\n       Although defendant ultimately obtained the relief to which he was entitled under\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (b), that is, resentencing to a misdemeanor for each of his\neligible felony convictions, he contends his claims on appeal are not moot and that there\nmay be collateral consequences as a result of the trial court’s procedure in revoking\nprobation and imposing felony sentences. At oral argument, defendant and the Attorney\nGeneral agreed that the proper remedy would be to strike the trial court’s orders revoking\nprobation and imposing felony sentences.
