JONES, Circuit Judge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the school board of Quitman County, Mississippi, voted unanimously to close its only remaining public school with a significant white student population, both black and white parents of students at the school complained.  Their school, Crowder Elementary and Junior High, was the most academically proficient and racially balanced school in the district at that time.  It was also by far the smallest school in a district chafing from serious financial problems.  The district court refused to enjoin Crowder from being closed.  The question before us is whether the district court abused its discretion in holding that the school board could choose to close Crowder consistent with its duty under a federal desegregation order.  Unpalatable as that choice seems from an educational standpoint, this court sits not to review the wisdom of a school board's actions, but their constitutionality.  We affirm the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The public schools of Quitman County have been operating under a federal court desegregation order since 1969.  A 1986 court order permitted the school district to close three of its four formerly all-white schools, Lambert, Marks, and Sledge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Crowder, the fourth, remained open.  The district continues to operate three other combined elementary and junior high schools, Southside, Westside, and Falcon, as well as Quitman County High School.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No doubt a major reason schools were closing is that the county's total population fell from 15,888 in 1970 to 10,490 in 1990.  The racial mix remained relatively stable.  Of those aged 17 and under in 1970, 33% were white and 67% were black.  In 1990, the proportions were 29% and 71%, respectively.  But because disproportionately white private schools sprang up after the 1969 desegregation order, by 1990, whites comprised a bare 10% of the district's 2,164 students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Crowder, whites remained a majority of the student population.  In March, 1991, when the school board voted to close the school, it had 110 white students (73%) and 40 black students (27%).  By contrast, the other three elementary and junior high schools in the district had much larger and overwhelmingly black student populations.  At Southside there were 523 black students (90%) and 58 white students (10%);  at Westside, 434 black (94%), 28 white (6%);  and at Falcon, 436 black (98%), 9 white (2%).  At Quitman County High School, 509 students were black (97%) and 17 were white (3%).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowder's enrollment was declining steadily, from 238 students in 1986 to 150 students by 1991.  At the district court's hearing on whether to close Crowder, parents attributed this decline in part to uncertainty over whether the district would keep the school open.  The school board had first publicly considered closing Crowder after receiving a consultant's recommendation in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowder's academic record is unmatched in Quitman County schools.  Its students have fared better than all other students in the district on standardized tests.  Its black students also scored significantly higher by standardized measures than other black students in the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1990, faced with dire fiscal straits, the Quitman County School Board proposed closing Crowder and sending its students who chose to remain in the public schools elsewhere in the district.  Ms. Sandra Biffle, the district's secretary, testified at the hearing below that closing Crowder would save the district $325,860.00, including savings in teachers' salaries, maintenance, insurance and repairs.  Certain ambiguities and possible omissions from these calculations render uncertain the total amount saved.  Nevertheless, the school district argued that its finances would be jeopardized unless it closed Crowder, and the district court agreed with this assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the district's savings from closing Crowder come from the expected loss of students who officials anticipated would choose to go to private school or would move to an adjoining public school district rather than transfer to one of the other public schools in Quitman County.  Biffle stated that the district expected that Crowder's forty black students would transfer to one of the other three elementary or junior high schools, and nearly all of the 110 white students would drop out of Quitman County schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school board failed explicitly to consider the effect of its decision to close Crowder upon the district court's longstanding desegregation order.  Superintendent Wright testified that the district considered only the potential financial benefit of closing Crowder, not its effect on desegregation.  It has never been asserted, however, that the board, three of whose five members are black, decided to close Crowder for the purpose of hindering desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants, plaintiff-intervenor families of black children attending Crowder, challenged the school district's decision in federal court, seeking a preliminary injunction barring closure of Crowder.  On July 18, 1991, the district court denied the preliminary injunction.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before a preliminary injunction may issue, the plaintiffs must show that (1) there is a substantial likelihood they will prevail ultimately on the merits, (2) there is a substantial danger they will suffer irreparable injury if an injunction does not issue, (3) the threatened injury outweighs any harm to the defendant resulting from the injunction, and (4) the injunction will not harm the public interest.  Roho, Inc. v. Marquis, 902 F.2d 356, 358 (5th Cir.1990).  The district court concluded that the appellants failed to meet any of these requirements.  Whether the injunction was properly denied is tested under an abuse of discretion standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the plaintiff-intervenors failed to state a relevant constitutional claim.  One black parent who testified at the hearing stated that he wanted his child to continue attending school with white children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Other plaintiff parents stated only that they preferred their children to attend Crowder because it was closer to home and a good school.  The court construed these parents' position most generously as a request that it impose a duty on the school board to maintain a system that (a) reflects the racial population of Quitman County in each school and (b) discourages white flight from the schools that remain open.  The district court correctly held that the first noted duty does not exist in desegregation law.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 24, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1280, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).  We agree that the second duty, which might also be characterized as a duty not to perpetuate or re-establish a dual system, was not violated on the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has stated that as long as a school district remains under the superintendence of a federal desegregation order, it has a duty \"to take all steps necessary to eliminate the vestiges of the unconstitutional de jure system.\"  Freeman v. Pitts, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1443, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992).  Eliminating unconstitutional separate student attendance patterns has been a keystone of this remedy.  Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1445.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>    The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that federal court injunctive power \"may be exercised only on the basis of a constitutional violation,\" and that the \"nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S.Ct. at 1276.   Consequently, a district court may at some point decline to order \"further remedies in the area of student assignments where racial imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to constitutional violations.\"  Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1446.   The Court also observed that \"with the passage of time the degree to which racial imbalances continue to represent vestiges of a constitutional violation may diminish, ...\"  Id.  Freeman placed the burden of proof on the school district to show that a \"current imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way,\" to the prior constitutional violation.  --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1447.  Freeman urged an intensely practical, fact-specific approach to these decisions, and it rejected the notion that \"awkward,\" \"inconvenient,\" or \"even bizarre\" measures must be employed to achieve racially balanced school assignments \"in the late phases of carrying out a decree, when the imbalance is attributable neither to the prior de jure system nor to a later violation by the school district but rather to independent demographic forces.\"  --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1447.  Freeman reinforced the Court's decision a year earlier to permit a district court to relinquish supervision under a desegregation decree if \"the vestiges of discrimination [have] been eliminated to the extent practicable.\"  Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 249, 111 S.Ct. 630, 638, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freeman and Dowell might be technically distinguished from the case before us on the ground that those cases considered the circumstances under which federal court control of a school district may finally be relinquished.  This appeal does not present exactly that issue, for Quitman County has not sought to terminate its desegregation case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This court used to evaluate termination of desegregation decrees under the global inquiry whether the school district had achieved \"unitary\" status.  See, e.g., Monteilh, 848 F.2d at 629 and n. 7 (citing cases).  Freeman and Dowell make clear, however, that there is no longer magic in the phrase unitary status, which had spawned much uncertainty and a conflict among the circuits.  See Comment, 2 Seton Hall Const. L.J. 337 (1991).  Following Freeman, the lower courts have discretion to terminate a desegregation case if a school board has consistently complied with a court decree in good faith and has eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent \"practicable.\"  Freeman created a framework in which equitable decrees will not remain in effect perpetually and school districts can be returned to local control.  We believe the same considerations--good faith compliance, practicability of further desegregation, and local control--are also pertinent to determining whether a particular school board action, in a district that has long lived with a desegregation decree but failed to seek dismissal of the case, sufficiently comports with the goals of the decree.  The tests of practicability and good faith should inform, as they did here, a district court's exercise of its equitable powers where a desegregation decree has been in effect for some years.  Indeed, it would be peculiar if a school district such as Quitman County's could qualify for termination of its desegregation decree under Freeman and Dowell but, allegedly bowing to older precedents, could not adjust school boundaries to remedy a financial crisis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if we rely upon caselaw that emphasized the duty to desegregate, there has been no hard and fast rule preventing legitimate school closings.  The decision to open or close schools, like the reordering of student assignments in Freeman or Dowell, is often undertaken because of changing school populations.  Facing this demographic problem in the context of school construction or consolidation decisions, our court has counselled that such decisions may not be used to perpetuate or reestablish the dual system, Monteilh, 848 F.2d at 631, quoting Swann, supra, 402 U.S. at 21, 91 S.Ct. at 1278;  Davis v. East Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 721 F.2d 1425, 1435 (5th Cir.1983).  On the other hand, there is no constitutional duty to achieve maximum desegregation or to achieve an ideal racial balance in the schools.  Monteilh, 848 F.2d at 632.   This court has also recognized limits imposed upon desegregation efforts by population changes and the reality of white flight, holding that \"school officials who have taken effective action have no affirmative fourteenth-amendment duty to respond to the private actions of those who vote with their feet.\"  Ross v. Houston Independent Sch. District, 699 F.2d 218, 288 (5th Cir.1983), citing Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these principles, the Quitman County School Board had no duty to keep Crowder open in order to maintain one partially integrated school housing fewer than 7% of the district's students.  Crowder's racial mix was a statistical fluke:  even if the entire white school-age population of Quitman County had attended public school, they still made up only 29% of that population in 1990.  No party has asserted that any of the Quitman County schools or their attendance zones were affected by deliberately discriminatory line-drawing at any time since the advent of the desegregation decree.  No one has asserted either that the board ever violated the desegregation decree in any other way or that it was motivated by an intent to resegregate when it unanimously decided to close Crowder.  Finally, appellants have not demonstrated that the district court's finding of financial necessity to close Crowder was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is whether the board had the duty to close another elementary-junior high school or to seek another remedy for its financial problems in such a way as to maximize the impact on the schools' desegregation.  While the duty to avoid actions that would deliberately reinvigorate segregation remains constant, a school board need not create financially impossible situations or engage in \"heroic measures\" to comply with that duty.  See Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1447.   Although the plaintiff-intervenors assert that the board could have moved more black children to Crowder, increasing its cost-effectiveness, they did not effectively challenge the board's emphatic denial that it could operate four elementary schools.  Yet to keep Crowder open would require either that result or a closure of one of the other three schools, which would precipitate massive student relocations.  Crowder's enrollment had been declining steadily for five years before the court's hearing on closure.  The school board would have been striking in the dark, at best, to order one of the other three, much larger schools closed and to transfer hundreds of children around the county in the hope that white children would continue to attend an expanded Crowder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quitman County does not offer the prospect of alternative methods for desegregation that we have discussed in connection with approving the unitary status of school districts such as those in Houston and Fort Worth or in declaring dissatisfaction with the progress of desegregation in Baton Rouge.  See, Ross, supra;  Flax v. Potts, 915 F.2d 155 (5th Cir.1990);  Davis v. East Baton Rouge, supra.   The possibility of creating magnet schools, the existence of a more racially balanced overall population, a stable or growing population, a large tax base--none of those factors is present in Quitman County.  White school-age pupils had declined to less than 10% of the Quitman County school population at the time of the district court hearing.  If the 110 white children all left the public system after Crowder's closing fewer than 5% white students would remain.  The possible reduction from a 10% to 5% white student population, while regrettable, imposes no significant detriment to the pre-existing potential for desegregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Conversely, taking costly steps to try to retain the additional 5% of white students at Crowder could achieve only a pyrrhic victory in a virtually all-black school system.  Further desegregation of the district is not practicable at this time, while closing Crowder had but a minor impact on the racial balance of the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that plaintiff-intervenors did not establish a substantial likelihood that they could prevail on the merits of their case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although their failure on this point is sufficient ground to affirm the district court's denial of injunctive relief, we also rely upon the court's assessment of the balance of hardships and the public interest.  The court was not clearly erroneous in finding that closing Crowder would enable the district to conserve its scarce financial resources, while leaving the school open would jeopardize the district and thus penalize all of the non-Crowder students.  The testimony underlying this finding was earlier noted and, although challenged on some points by plaintiff-intervenors, was not significantly rebutted.  Quitman County could not afford to keep open a marginal population school.  Doing so would come at the expense of over 90% of the district's students who did not attend Crowder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case closely resembles the recent decision of the Eleventh Circuit that permitted closure of a marginally populated school and its consolidation with another school in the district over the objections that this action violated a desegregation decree.  Harris v. Crenshaw County Bd. of Educ., 968 F.2d 1090 (11th Cir.1992).  Neither there nor here was the board's decision made in defiance of the decree, and in each case it was not economically or educationally sensible to keep a tiny school open.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court denying preliminary injunctive relief is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JUSTICE, District Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enforcement of school desegregation orders has proven among the most nettlesome controversies faced by the federal judiciary.  On the one hand, comprehensive and systemic relief has been necessary to remedy school systems subject to generations of de jure segregation, and to bring the unlawful dual school systems into alignment with the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Yet, on the other hand, independent local control of school systems by school boards, responsive to parent and community needs, is a hallmark of our public education system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  Any unnecessary intrusion by the judiciary can only enervate the local school board decision-making process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's majority, while apparently attempting to vindicate the integrity of local school board autonomy, has, notwithstanding, done so at the expense of the federal judiciary's preeminent role:  enforcement of constitutional guarantees.  Even though the Quitman County School Board's decision to close Crowder Elementary and Junior High School was manifestly at odds with its duty under a 1969 federal desegregation order, neither the school board, nor the district court below, nor the majority's opinion, has purported to reconcile such actions with the 1969 order.  For these reasons, and because the district court failed to make mandatory findings of fact and conclusions of law, thereby preventing the appellate court from ascertaining the legal and factual bases for the district court's decision to deny a motion for preliminary injunction, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Summary of the Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 1969, after a finding that Quitman County local school authorities were operating an unconstitutional de jure segregated school system, the Honorable William C. Keady, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Mississippi, entered a desegregation order (the \"desegregation order\"), which has never been set aside.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  Thus, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi (the \"district court\") retains jurisdiction to this day to enforce the terms of, and supervise the Quitman County School Board's compliance with, the desegregation order, including, inter alia, actions relating to student school assignments.  Green v. New Kent County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1693-94, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968);  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 26, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1281, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971);  Davis v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Board, 721 F.2d 1425, 1435 (5th Cir.1983);  Harris v. Crenshaw County Board of Education, 968 F.2d 1090, 1094-95 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with the obligation imposed on it by the terms of the desegregation order, the Quitman County School Board (the \"school board\") \"petitioned\" the district court to close Crowder Elementary and Junior High School (\"Crowder\"), on March 27, 1991.  When appellants, plaintiff-intervenor families of African-American school children attending Crowder, sought to enjoin the school board from closing it, the district court denied them relief, finding that they failed to state a constitutional claim, and that the school board's felt economic pressures were adequate justification for abandoning Crowder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1991, when the school board voted to close Crowder, the racial composition of the student body was seventy-three percent Caucasian, and twenty-seven percent African-American.  Crowder was, by all standards, the most academically successful and racially balanced school in the district.  A 1986 court order had already permitted the school district to close three of its four formerly all-white schools, leaving Crowder, the fourth, as the only remaining school with a significant white population.  In contrast, African-American students made up greater than ninety-four percent of the student body at each of the three remaining schools in Quitman County, schools whose academic standing and racial balance fell far short of Crowder's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school board admitted that its decision to close Crowder was based on purely economic factors.  Sandra Biffle, the school district's secretary, testified at the hearing below that closing Crowder would save the school district $325,860.00.  School Superintendent Wright testified that continued operation of Crowder would financially jeopardize the entire school system.  As the majority's opinion notes, however, \"certain ambiguities and possible omissions from these calculations render uncertain the total amount saved.\"  (Maj. opinion at p. 1452).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biffle also testified below that if Crowder were closed, nearly all of the 110 Caucasian students attending Crowder would leave the public school system, and that their parents, though remaining in the school district, would enroll them in private schools, rather than send them to one of the other public schools in Quitman County.  According to Biffle, the remaining forty African-American students would transfer to one of the three remaining public schools in Quitman County.  Moreover, the school board claimed that it had no constitutional obligation to remedy the evident racial imbalance, caused by a depleted white student population, since it was caused by independent demographic forces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>II.

The majority's opinion, moreover, only compounds the errors below when it recites, with approval, the factors which the district court considered dispositive in denying to appellants preliminary injunctive relief.  In this respect, the district court held that appellants never proved that the school board had an intent to discriminate against African-Americans in closing Crowder, that economic hardship alone could justify closing Crowder, and that racial imbalance and depletion of white students in the school district were caused by independent demographic forces which the school board had no duty to remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It bears emphasis that this appeal does not present the issue of a school district seeking to terminate a desegregation order.  Rather, this appeal concerns a school board's proposal to close a school in a school district which is currently under a desegregation order.   Although the majority's opinion recognizes the posture of this case (Maj. opinion at pp. 1453-54), it inexplicably adopts the legal analysis governing whether a district court should be permitted to relinquish supervision of a desegregation order.  See, e.g., Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 249-50, 111 S.Ct. 630, 637-38, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991) (Factors a district court must consider before dissolving a desegregation order are:  \"whether the board had complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated to the extent practicable.\");  Freeman v. Pitts, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a>  The majority's extension of the legal standard governing termination of a desegregation order to this action, involving a school board's petition to close a school while the desegregation order is still extant, lacking, as it does, any foundation or support in precedent, amounts to an unwarranted ipse dixit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The School Board</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's opinion mistakenly stresses that appellants proffered no evidence that the Board (three of whose five members were black (Maj. opinion at pp. 1453, 1456)), intended to discriminate in its decision to close Crowder or that it acted in bad faith under the desegregation order:  \"No party has asserted that any of the Quitman County schools or their attendance zones were affected by deliberately discriminatory line-drawing at any time since the advent of the desegregation decree ... [or] that the board ever violated the desegregation decree or that it was motivated by an intent to resegregate when it unanimously decided to close Crowder.\"  (Maj. opinion at p. 1455).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intent to discriminate is not a sine qua non for a district court's determination that a school board violated a desegregation order in deciding to close a school.  See Swann, 402 U.S. at 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1281;  Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, 88 S.Ct. at 1693-94;  Davis, 721 F.2d at 1435.   The indispensable determination, rather, is whether the school board's proposed actions will perpetuate or recreate a segregated school system.  Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1455 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (original emphasis) (\"it is the operation of a racially segregated school system that must be remedied, not discriminatory policy in some discrete subpart of that system.\").  See also Fordice, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2738 (remanding for consideration of effect on desegregation of admission's standards, program duplication, institutional mission assignment, and continued operation of all eight public universities (five white, three black), \"even though such policies may be race-neutral on their face.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's opinion cites a purportedly comparable Eleventh Circuit decision, in which the court affirmed closure of a marginally populated school and its consolidation with another school in the district, over the objections that the school board's action violated a desegregation order.  See Harris v. Crenshaw County Board of Education, 968 F.2d 1090 (11th Cir.1992).  Drawing an inapt analogy, the majority's opinion asserts that, \"[n]either there nor here was the board's decision made in defiance of the [desegregation] decree, and in each case it was not economically or educationally sensible to keep a tiny school open.\"  (Maj. opinion at p. 1456).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Harris case is inapposite on several levels.  First, the facts are dissimilar.  In Harris, African-Americans made up seventy percent of the student body at the school which the Crenshaw County School Board sought to close.  The student body at Crowder, in contrast, was seventy-three percent white.  Whether the school board had a discriminatory intent is a necessary inquiry in cases where the school being closed is composed of a predominantly minority student body, as in Harris, but not when the school consists of a predominantly white population, as in the case of Crowder.  See Harris, 968 F.2d at 1095;  Arvizu v. Waco Indep.  School Dist., 495 F.2d 499, 505 (5th Cir.1974) (school board seeking to close school with predominantly minority population must \"adduce evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that [its] actions were not in fact motivated by racial reasons.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, in Harris, the school board made an exhaustive inquiry regarding the potential ramifications of closure.  The school board, in concluding that the school should be closed and consolidated with another school in the county, explicitly considered the following factors, as required by the outstanding desegregation order in the school district:  (1) educational opportunities at both schools;  (2) economics;  (3) size of student enrollment;  (4) the effect of the closure and consolidation on the outstanding federal desegregation order;  (5) transportation;  and (6) alternatives to closure.  Harris, 968 F.2d at 1093.   The Eleventh Circuit emphasized that consolidation of the schools would actually produce further desegregation.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, closure of Crowder was premised purely on economic savings.  The school board admitted that it never considered the impact of closure on the desegregation order.  (Maj. opinion at p. 1453).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a>  The school board, as well, did not attempt to balance the constitutional importance of Crowder's academic prestige and racially balanced student body, nor did it consider any alternatives to closure.  Finally, Sandra Biffle, school district secretary, testified below that closure would exacerbate segregation, a per se violation of its affirmative duty under the desegregation order.  See Swann, 402 U.S. at 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1281;  Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, 88 S.Ct. at 1693-94;  Davis, 721 F.2d at 1435.

The District Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More to the point, the district court erred in failing to scrutinize all school board actions, to determine whether the school district was fulfilling its \"affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch,\" a duty which, to reiterate, remains enforceable without a finding of a further constitutional violation.  Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, 88 S.Ct. at 1693-94;  Swann, 402 U.S. at 20-21, 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1278-79;  Davis, 721 F.2d at 1435;  Harris, 968 F.2d at 1094-95;  Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1456 (Blackmun, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also erred in failing to establish whether the current racial imbalance was attributable to prior de jure segregation in Quitman County, or even to later violations by the school board.  While the school board has no affirmative obligation to remedy a racial imbalance caused by independent demographic forces, i.e., people \"voting with their feet,\" the district court and school board unquestionably do have a constitutionally imposed duty to make a threshold determination of whether the school board played a role in encouraging residential segregation.  See Keyes, 413 U.S. at 211, 93 S.Ct. at 2699;  Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1457 (Blackmun, J., concurring);  id. --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1454 (Souter, J., concurring);  Swann, 402 U.S. at 20-21, 91 S.Ct. at 1278-79.   Without a determinate answer to these inquiries, it is at best premature, and at worst disingenuous, to conclude that the racial imbalance in the Quitman County school district was caused solely by independent demographic forces, and thus that the appellants failed to state a constitutionally cognizable claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Integrated schools are no less desirable because they are burdensome to achieve;  and integrated schools remain a constitutional requirement, even though Brown 's thirty-nine year old mandate is still to be fulfilled.

To the majority of this court, granting appellants injunctive relief to keep Crowder open would be a \"pyrrhic victory,\" a victory gained at too great a financial cost.  (Maj. opinion at p. 1456).  But closing Crowder, the most academically successful and racially balanced school in an otherwise predominantly African-American school system, would, in my opinion, be a much greater loss--a stripping away of the constitutionally protected rights of African-American school children, a grievous injury which would convey a message of \"inferiority as to the status [of African-American school children] in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to be undone.\"  Brown, 347 U.S. at 494, 74 S.Ct. at 691.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court denying preliminary injunctive relief should be reversed, and this civil action remanded to the district court, in order that it may, in accordance with the proper legal and factual inquiry set forth above:  (1) require the school board to consider the impact of closing Crowder on the outstanding desegregation order;  (2) determine whether closure would violate the outstanding federal desegregation order by recreating and perpetuating one-race schools;  and (3) ascertain whether the residential segregation and predicted \"white flight\" are influenced by prior de jure segregation and the accompanying attitudes and patterns of thought accompanying this system.

JONES, Circuit Judge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the school board of Quitman County, Mississippi, voted unanimously to close its only remaining public school with a significant white student population, both black and white parents of students at the school complained.  Their school, Crowder Elementary and Junior High, was the most academically proficient and racially balanced school in the district at that time.  It was also by far the smallest school in a district chafing from serious financial problems.  The district court refused to enjoin Crowder from being closed.  The question before us is whether the district court abused its discretion in holding that the school board could choose to close Crowder consistent with its duty under a federal desegregation order.  Unpalatable as that choice seems from an educational standpoint, this court sits not to review the wisdom of a school board's actions, but their constitutionality.  We affirm the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The public schools of Quitman County have been operating under a federal court desegregation order since 1969.  A 1986 court order permitted the school district to close three of its four formerly all-white schools, Lambert, Marks, and Sledge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Crowder, the fourth, remained open.  The district continues to operate three other combined elementary and junior high schools, Southside, Westside, and Falcon, as well as Quitman County High School.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No doubt a major reason schools were closing is that the county's total population fell from 15,888 in 1970 to 10,490 in 1990.  The racial mix remained relatively stable.  Of those aged 17 and under in 1970, 33% were white and 67% were black.  In 1990, the proportions were 29% and 71%, respectively.  But because disproportionately white private schools sprang up after the 1969 desegregation order, by 1990, whites comprised a bare 10% of the district's 2,164 students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Crowder, whites remained a majority of the student population.  In March, 1991, when the school board voted to close the school, it had 110 white students (73%) and 40 black students (27%).  By contrast, the other three elementary and junior high schools in the district had much larger and overwhelmingly black student populations.  At Southside there were 523 black students (90%) and 58 white students (10%);  at Westside, 434 black (94%), 28 white (6%);  and at Falcon, 436 black (98%), 9 white (2%).  At Quitman County High School, 509 students were black (97%) and 17 were white (3%).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowder's enrollment was declining steadily, from 238 students in 1986 to 150 students by 1991.  At the district court's hearing on whether to close Crowder, parents attributed this decline in part to uncertainty over whether the district would keep the school open.  The school board had first publicly considered closing Crowder after receiving a consultant's recommendation in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowder's academic record is unmatched in Quitman County schools.  Its students have fared better than all other students in the district on standardized tests.  Its black students also scored significantly higher by standardized measures than other black students in the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1990, faced with dire fiscal straits, the Quitman County School Board proposed closing Crowder and sending its students who chose to remain in the public schools elsewhere in the district.  Ms. Sandra Biffle, the district's secretary, testified at the hearing below that closing Crowder would save the district $325,860.00, including savings in teachers' salaries, maintenance, insurance and repairs.  Certain ambiguities and possible omissions from these calculations render uncertain the total amount saved.  Nevertheless, the school district argued that its finances would be jeopardized unless it closed Crowder, and the district court agreed with this assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the district's savings from closing Crowder come from the expected loss of students who officials anticipated would choose to go to private school or would move to an adjoining public school district rather than transfer to one of the other public schools in Quitman County.  Biffle stated that the district expected that Crowder's forty black students would transfer to one of the other three elementary or junior high schools, and nearly all of the 110 white students would drop out of Quitman County schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school board failed explicitly to consider the effect of its decision to close Crowder upon the district court's longstanding desegregation order.  Superintendent Wright testified that the district considered only the potential financial benefit of closing Crowder, not its effect on desegregation.  It has never been asserted, however, that the board, three of whose five members are black, decided to close Crowder for the purpose of hindering desegregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants, plaintiff-intervenor families of black children attending Crowder, challenged the school district's decision in federal court, seeking a preliminary injunction barring closure of Crowder.  On July 18, 1991, the district court denied the preliminary injunction.

The court construed these parents' position most generously as a request that it impose a duty on the school board to maintain a system that (a) reflects the racial population of Quitman County in each school and (b) discourages white flight from the schools that remain open.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S.Ct. at 1276.   Consequently, a district court may at some point decline to order \"further remedies in the area of student assignments where racial imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to constitutional violations.\"  Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1446.

This appeal does not present exactly that issue, for Quitman County has not sought to terminate its desegregation case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This court used to evaluate termination of desegregation decrees under the global inquiry whether the school district had achieved \"unitary\" status.  See, e.g., Monteilh, 848 F.2d at 629 and n. 7 (citing cases).  Freeman and Dowell make clear, however, that there is no longer magic in the phrase unitary status, which had spawned much uncertainty and a conflict among the circuits.  See Comment, 2 Seton Hall Const. L.J. 337 (1991).  Following Freeman, the lower courts have discretion to terminate a desegregation case if a school board has consistently complied with a court decree in good faith and has eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent \"practicable.\"  Freeman created a framework in which equitable decrees will not remain in effect perpetually and school districts can be returned to local control.  We believe the same considerations--good faith compliance, practicability of further desegregation, and local control--are also pertinent to determining whether a particular school board action, in a district that has long lived with a desegregation decree but failed to seek dismissal of the case, sufficiently comports with the goals of the decree.  The tests of practicability and good faith should inform, as they did here, a district court's exercise of its equitable powers where a desegregation decree has been in effect for some years.  Indeed, it would be peculiar if a school district such as Quitman County's could qualify for termination of its desegregation decree under Freeman and Dowell but, allegedly bowing to older precedents, could not adjust school boundaries to remedy a financial crisis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if we rely upon caselaw that emphasized the duty to desegregate, there has been no hard and fast rule preventing legitimate school closings.  The decision to open or close schools, like the reordering of student assignments in Freeman or Dowell, is often undertaken because of changing school populations.  Facing this demographic problem in the context of school construction or consolidation decisions, our court has counselled that such decisions may not be used to perpetuate or reestablish the dual system, Monteilh, 848 F.2d at 631, quoting Swann, supra, 402 U.S. at 21, 91 S.Ct. at 1278;  Davis v.

On the other hand, there is no constitutional duty to achieve maximum desegregation or to achieve an ideal racial balance in the schools.  Monteilh, 848 F.2d at 632.   This court has also recognized limits imposed upon desegregation efforts by population changes and the reality of white flight, holding that \"school officials who have taken effective action have no affirmative fourteenth-amendment duty to respond to the private actions of those who vote with their feet.\"  Ross v.

Crowder's racial mix was a statistical fluke:  even if the entire white school-age population of Quitman County had attended public school, they still made up only 29% of that population in 1990.  No party has asserted that any of the Quitman County schools or their attendance zones were affected by deliberately discriminatory line-drawing at any time since the advent of the desegregation decree.  No one has asserted either that the board ever violated the desegregation decree in any other way or that it was motivated by an intent to resegregate when it unanimously decided to close Crowder.  Finally, appellants have not demonstrated that the district court's finding of financial necessity to close Crowder was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is whether the board had the duty to close another elementary-junior high school or to seek another remedy for its financial problems in such a way as to maximize the impact on the schools' desegregation.  While the duty to avoid actions that would deliberately reinvigorate segregation remains constant, a school board need not create financially impossible situations or engage in \"heroic measures\" to comply with that duty.  See Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1447.   Although the plaintiff-intervenors assert that the board could have moved more black children to Crowder, increasing its cost-effectiveness, they did not effectively challenge the board's emphatic denial that it could operate four elementary schools.  Yet to keep Crowder open would require either that result or a closure of one of the other three schools, which would precipitate massive student relocations.  Crowder's enrollment had been declining steadily for five years before the court's hearing on closure.  The school board would have been striking in the dark, at best, to order one of the other three, much larger schools closed and to transfer hundreds of children around the county in the hope that white children would continue to attend an expanded Crowder.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quitman County does not offer the prospect of alternative methods for desegregation that we have discussed in connection with approving the unitary status of school districts such as those in Houston and Fort Worth or in declaring dissatisfaction with the progress of desegregation in Baton Rouge.  See, Ross, supra;  Flax v. Potts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548703\"><a href=\"/opinion/548703/arlene-flax-etc-v-ws-potts-fort-worth-independent-school-district-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1990);  Davis v. East Baton Rouge, supra.   The possibility of creating magnet schools, the existence of a more racially balanced overall population, a stable or growing population, a large tax base--none of those factors is present in Quitman County.  White school-age pupils had declined to less than 10% of the Quitman County school population at the time of the district court hearing.  If the 110 white children all left the public system after Crowder's closing fewer than 5% white students would remain.  The possible reduction from a 10% to 5% white student population, while regrettable, imposes no significant detriment to the pre-existing potential for desegregation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Conversely, taking costly steps to try to retain the additional 5% of white students at Crowder could achieve only a pyrrhic victory in a virtually all-black school system.  Further desegregation of the district is not practicable at this time, while closing Crowder had but a minor impact on the racial balance of the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that plaintiff-intervenors did not establish a substantial likelihood that they could prevail on the merits of their case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although their failure on this point is sufficient ground to affirm the district court's denial of injunctive relief, we also rely upon the court's assessment of the balance of hardships and the public interest.  The court was not clearly erroneous in finding that closing Crowder would enable the district to conserve its scarce financial resources, while leaving the school open would jeopardize the district and thus penalize all of the non-Crowder students.  The testimony underlying this finding was earlier noted and, although challenged on some points by plaintiff-intervenors, was not significantly rebutted.  Quitman County could not afford to keep open a marginal population school.  Doing so would come at the expense of over 90% of the district's students who did not attend Crowder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case closely resembles the recent decision of the Eleventh Circuit that permitted closure of a marginally populated school and its consolidation with another school in the district over the objections that this action violated a desegregation decree.

On the one hand, comprehensive and systemic relief has been necessary to remedy school systems subject to generations of de jure segregation, and to bring the unlawful dual school systems into alignment with the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Yet, on the other hand, independent local control of school systems by school boards, responsive to parent and community needs, is a hallmark of our public education system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  Any unnecessary intrusion by the judiciary can only enervate the local school board decision-making process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's majority, while apparently attempting to vindicate the integrity of local school board autonomy, has, notwithstanding, done so at the expense of the federal judiciary's preeminent role:  enforcement of constitutional guarantees.  Even though the Quitman County School Board's decision to close Crowder Elementary and Junior High School was manifestly at odds with its duty under a 1969 federal desegregation order, neither the school board, nor the district court below, nor the majority's opinion, has purported to reconcile such actions with the 1969 order.  For these reasons, and because the district court failed to make mandatory findings of fact and conclusions of law, thereby preventing the appellate court from ascertaining the legal and factual bases for the district court's decision to deny a motion for preliminary injunction, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Summary of the Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 1969, after a finding that Quitman County local school authorities were operating an unconstitutional de jure segregated school system, the Honorable William C.

When appellants, plaintiff-intervenor families of African-American school children attending Crowder, sought to enjoin the school board from closing it, the district court denied them relief, finding that they failed to state a constitutional claim, and that the school board's felt economic pressures were adequate justification for abandoning Crowder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1991, when the school board voted to close Crowder, the racial composition of the student body was seventy-three percent Caucasian, and twenty-seven percent African-American.  Crowder was, by all standards, the most academically successful and racially balanced school in the district.  A 1986 court order had already permitted the school district to close three of its four formerly all-white schools, leaving Crowder, the fourth, as the only remaining school with a significant white population.  In contrast, African-American students made up greater than ninety-four percent of the student body at each of the three remaining schools in Quitman County, schools whose academic standing and racial balance fell far short of Crowder's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school board admitted that its decision to close Crowder was based on purely economic factors.  Sandra Biffle, the school district's secretary, testified at the hearing below that closing Crowder would save the school district $325,860.00.  School Superintendent Wright testified that continued operation of Crowder would financially jeopardize the entire school system.  As the majority's opinion notes, however, \"certain ambiguities and possible omissions from these calculations render uncertain the total amount saved.\"  (Maj. opinion at p. 1452).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biffle also testified below that if Crowder were closed, nearly all of the 110 Caucasian students attending Crowder would leave the public school system, and that their parents, though remaining in the school district, would enroll them in private schools, rather than send them to one of the other public schools in Quitman County.  According to Biffle, the remaining forty African-American students would transfer to one of the three remaining public schools in Quitman County.  Moreover, the school board claimed that it had no constitutional obligation to remedy the evident racial imbalance, caused by a depleted white student population, since it was caused by independent demographic forces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>II.

The majority's opinion, moreover, only compounds the errors below when it recites, with approval, the factors which the district court considered dispositive in denying to appellants preliminary injunctive relief.  In this respect, the district court held that appellants never proved that the school board had an intent to discriminate against African-Americans in closing Crowder, that economic hardship alone could justify closing Crowder, and that racial imbalance and depletion of white students in the school district were caused by independent demographic forces which the school board had no duty to remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It bears emphasis that this appeal does not present the issue of a school district seeking to terminate a desegregation order.  Rather, this appeal concerns a school board's proposal to close a school in a school district which is currently under a desegregation order.   Although the majority's opinion recognizes the posture of this case (Maj. opinion at pp. 1453-54), it inexplicably adopts the legal analysis governing whether a district court should be permitted to relinquish supervision of a desegregation order.

The School Board</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's opinion mistakenly stresses that appellants proffered no evidence that the Board (three of whose five members were black (Maj. opinion at pp. 1453, 1456)), intended to discriminate in its decision to close Crowder or that it acted in bad faith under the desegregation order:  \"No party has asserted that any of the Quitman County schools or their attendance zones were affected by deliberately discriminatory line-drawing at any time since the advent of the desegregation decree ...

The indispensable determination, rather, is whether the school board's proposed actions will perpetuate or recreate a segregated school system.  Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1455 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (original emphasis) (\"it is the operation of a racially segregated school system that must be remedied, not discriminatory policy in some discrete subpart of that system.\").  See also Fordice, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2738 (remanding for consideration of effect on desegregation of admission's standards, program duplication, institutional mission assignment, and continued operation of all eight public universities (five white, three black), \"even though such policies may be race-neutral on their face.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's opinion cites a purportedly comparable Eleventh Circuit decision, in which the court affirmed closure of a marginally populated school and its consolidation with another school in the district, over the objections that the school board's action violated a desegregation order.  See Harris v. Crenshaw County Board of Education, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586431\"><a href=\"/opinion/586431/annie-yvonne-harris-a-minor-by-her-father-and-next-friend-collins-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1992).  Drawing an inapt analogy, the majority's opinion asserts that, \"[n]either there nor here was the board's decision made in defiance of the [desegregation] decree, and in each case it was not economically or educationally sensible to keep a tiny school open.\"  (Maj. opinion at p. 1456).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Harris case is inapposite on several levels.  First, the facts are dissimilar.  In Harris, African-Americans made up seventy percent of the student body at the school which the Crenshaw County School Board sought to close.  The student body at Crowder, in contrast, was seventy-three percent white.  Whether the school board had a discriminatory intent is a necessary inquiry in cases where the school being closed is composed of a predominantly minority student body, as in Harris, but not when the school consists of a predominantly white population, as in the case of Crowder.  See Harris, 968 F.2d at 1095;  Arvizu v. Waco Indep.  School Dist., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"318521\"><a href=\"/opinion/318521/pete-d-arvizu-v-waco-independent-school-district-patricia-ann-baisey-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 505 (5th Cir.1974) (school board seeking to close school with predominantly minority population must \"adduce evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that [its] actions were not in fact motivated by racial reasons.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, in Harris, the school board made an exhaustive inquiry regarding the potential ramifications of closure.  The school board, in concluding that the school should be closed and consolidated with another school in the county, explicitly considered the following factors, as required by the outstanding desegregation order in the school district:  (1) educational opportunities at both schools;  (2) economics;  (3) size of student enrollment;  (4) the effect of the closure and consolidation on the outstanding federal desegregation order;  (5) transportation;  and (6) alternatives to closure.  Harris, 968 F.2d at 1093.   The Eleventh Circuit emphasized that consolidation of the schools would actually produce further desegregation.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, closure of Crowder was premised purely on economic savings.  The school board admitted that it never considered the impact of closure on the desegregation order.  (Maj. opinion at p. 1453).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a>  The school board, as well, did not attempt to balance the constitutional importance of Crowder's academic prestige and racially balanced student body, nor did it consider any alternatives to closure.  Finally, Sandra Biffle, school district secretary, testified below that closure would exacerbate segregation, a per se violation of its affirmative duty under the desegregation order.  See Swann, 402 U.S. at 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1281;  Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, 88 S.Ct. at 1693-94;  Davis, 721 F.2d at 1435.

The District Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More to the point, the district court erred in failing to scrutinize all school board actions, to determine whether the school district was fulfilling its \"affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch,\" a duty which, to reiterate, remains enforceable without a finding of a further constitutional violation.  Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, 88 S.Ct. at 1693-94;  Swann, 402 U.S. at 20-21, 26, 91 S.Ct. at 1278-79;  Davis, 721 F.2d at 1435;  Harris, 968 F.2d at 1094-95;  Freeman, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 1456 (Blackmun, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also erred in failing to establish whether the current racial imbalance was attributable to prior de jure segregation in Quitman County, or even to later violations by the school board.  While the school board has no affirmative obligation to remedy a racial imbalance caused by independent demographic forces, i.e., people \"voting with their feet,\" the district court and school board unquestionably do have a constitutionally imposed duty to make a threshold determination of whether the school board played a role in encouraging residential segregation.

To the majority of this court, granting appellants injunctive relief to keep Crowder open would be a \"pyrrhic victory,\" a victory gained at too great a financial cost.  (Maj. opinion at p. 1456).  But closing Crowder, the most academically successful and racially balanced school in an otherwise predominantly African-American school system, would, in my opinion, be a much greater loss--a stripping away of the constitutionally protected rights of African-American school children, a grievous injury which would convey a message of \"inferiority as to the status [of African-American school children] in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to be undone.\"  Brown, 347 U.S. at 494, 74 S.Ct. at 691.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court denying preliminary injunctive relief should be reversed, and this civil action remanded to the district court, in order that it may, in accordance with the proper legal and factual inquiry set forth above:  (1) require the school board to consider the impact of closing Crowder on the outstanding desegregation order;  (2) determine whether closure would violate the outstanding federal desegregation order by recreating and perpetuating one-race schools;  and (3) ascertain whether the residential segregation and predicted \"white flight\" are influenced by prior de jure segregation and the accompanying attitudes and patterns of thought accompanying this system.
