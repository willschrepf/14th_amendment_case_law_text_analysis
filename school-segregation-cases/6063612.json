The\n\nsole issue on appeal is whether the circuit court erred in its determination of the amount of\n\nreimbursable attorney fees and costs it awarded to Ms. Kemp.\n\n\n¶2        Ms. Kemp challenges the award on several grounds. For clarity sake we address Ms.\n\nKemp’s arguments as follows: (1) whether the circuit court applied the wrong methodology in\n\ncalculating the amount of reimbursable attorney fees; (2) whether the circuit court erred when it;\n\n(a) reduced the amount of costs requested by Ms. Kemp, (b) denied her request for attorney fees\n\nincurred for the fee petition proceeding, and (c) arbitrarily reduced her attorney fees request; and\n\n(3) whether the circuit court erred when it failed to award fees for the appellate proceedings.\n\n\n¶3                                      BACKGROUND\n\n\n¶4                                      I. Litigation History\n\n\n¶5        This court’s prior opinions as well as the opinion of our supreme court provide a detailed\n\nfactual background to this litigation. See Robinson v. Toyota Motor Credit Corp., 201 Ill. 2d 403\n\n(2002) (Robinson II); Robinson v. Toyota Motor Credit Corp., 2012 IL App (1st) 111889\n\n(Robinson III); Robinson v. Toyota Motor Credit Corp., 315 Ill. App. 3d 1086 (2000) (Robinson\n\nI). We will confine our recitation of the facts to those pertinent to the issues raised in the present\n\nappeal.\n\n\n¶6        Beginning with their original complaint filed in 1995, the plaintiffs, Ms. Kemp and\n\nEmma J. Robinson (Ms. Robinson or collectively, the plaintiffs), sought damages and attorney\n\nfees and costs for violations of federal and state law related to the motor vehicle leasing\n                                                   2\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nagreements they entered into with the defendants, Point One Toyota, Evanston, Toyota Motor\n\nCredit Corporation, and River Oaks Toyota. In their complaint and amended complaints, the\n\nplaintiffs alleged that various provisions of the motor vehicle leases violated the CLA, the\n\nIllinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (Consumer Fraud Act) (815 ILCS\n\n505/1 et seq. (West 1992)) and the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (815 ILCS 510/1et\n\nseq. (West 1992)). The plaintiffs also sought certification as a class action. In addition to her\n\njoint CLA claims with Ms. Robinson, in the first amended complaint, Ms. Kemp alleged an\n\nindividual claim under the CLA based on the failure to disclose the actual amount of the sales tax\n\nowed under her vehicle lease.\n\n\n¶7     By 2011, all that remained of their lawsuit were the plaintiffs’ joint CLA claims and Ms.\n\nKemp’s individual CLA claim. Following the filing of a third amended complaint and a hearing\n\non the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court granted summary\n\njudgment to the plaintiffs on their CLA lease termination and itemization of other charges claims\n\nand Ms. Kemp’s CLA individual claim. The court granted summary judgment to the defendants,\n\nTMCC and River Oaks Toyota (collectively TMCC) 1 on the plaintiffs’ default penalties claim.\n\nRobinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889, ¶ 11. Following an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court\n\ndenied the plaintiffs’ request for actual damages on their joint CLA claims but granted actual\n\ndamages to Ms. Kemp on her individual CLA claim. The court awarded Ms. Robinson statutory\n\ndamages of $1,000, and Ms. Kemp $1,596, in statutory and actual damages based on the failure\n\nto disclose. Ms. Kemp’s award reflected a reduction of the $500 set-off she received from\n\n\n       1\n           Point One Toyota, Evanston was not a party in Robinson III and it is not a party in this appeal.\n                                                           3\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114 \n\n\ndefendant Point One Toyota, Evanston. Robinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889, ¶ 12. The\n\n\ncircuit court awarded the plaintiffs $113,280 in attorney fees and costs of $420. Robinson III, \n\n\n2012 IL App (1st) 111889, ¶ 13. The plaintiffs appealed, and the defendants cross-appealed.\n\n\n\n¶8     On review, this court held that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on all \n\n\nof the plaintiffs’ joint claims under the CLA. We vacated the damages and attorney fees and \n\n\ncosts awarded to the plaintiffs on their joint CLA claims. We affirmed the actual and statutory\n\n\ndamages award to Ms. Kemp on her individual CLA claim. The case was remanded to the circuit\n\n\ncourt for a hearing on attorney fees and costs but only as to Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim.\n\n\nRobinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889, ¶ 84.\n\n\n\n¶9                             II. Proceedings on Remand to the Circuit Court\n\n\n\n¶ 10                                   A. The Fee Petition\n\n\n\n¶ 11   Ms. Kemp sought an award of attorney fees in the amount of $1,074,163 based on 2719.4 \n\n\nhours and at a rate of $395 per hour and an award of costs in the amount of $11,328.74. In \n\n\nresponse, TMCC maintained that the attorney fee award should be based on a rate of $300 per\n\n\nhour for the10.5 hours that could reasonably be said to have been spent on Ms. Kemp’s single\n\n\nsuccessful CLA claim.\n\n\n\n¶ 12                                   B. The Circuit Court’s Ruling\n\n\n\n¶ 13   On June 19, 2015, the circuit court issued its memorandum opinion and order. After\n\n\nreviewing the history of the litigation, the court noted that despite the small amount of her \n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nrecovery, Ms. Kemp was entitled to “reasonable” attorney fees under the CLA. 15 U.S.C. §1640\n\n(1994).\n\n\n¶ 14      The circuit court observed that such amount was determined by “ ‘the number of hours\n\nreasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonably hourly rate,’ ” or the lodestar\n\nfigure. 2 While the Supreme Court in Hensley recommended applying the 12 factors set forth in\n\nJohnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974) abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 92–93, 96, 109 S.Ct. 939, 103 L.Ed.2d 67\n\n(1989)., the circuit court noted that its more recent decision in Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U.S. 542\n\n(2010), had questioned the usefulness of the Johnson factors. See Perdue, 559 U.S. 553 (the\n\nCourt held that the lodestar figure included most if not all the relevant factors for determining a\n\nreasonable attorney fee).\n\n\n¶ 15      The circuit court recognized that losing on certain claims did not prevent a party from\n\nbeing a prevailing party and entitled to attorney fees. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434. The court\n\ndistinguished the failed joint CLA claims from Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim, finding that it\n\nfit what the Court in Hensley described as a “distinctly different claim.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n\n434. The circuit court determined that to allow fees to be recovered for Ms. Robinson’s claims\n\nonly because of the success of Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim, which was not even at issue,\n\nwas “not only illogical, but clearly against Congress’s intent in limiting attorney’s fee awards to\n\nsuccessful claims.” In light of the total lack of success, the court ruled that no time after June\n\n2011 would be compensated.\n\n          2\n              See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)).\n                                                           5\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n¶ 16   The circuit court awarded the 10.5 hours, which TMCC identified as work on Ms.\n\nKemp’s claim. The court determined that between 1995 and 1996, 7.6 hours were specifically\n\ndevoted to her claim. The circuit court determined that Ms. Kemp was entitled to be\n\ncompensated for time expended in the circuit court in 1998 contesting the dismissal motion,\n\nwhich included her sales tax claim and in the first appeal since the appeal was “a necessary step”\n\ntoward preserving her claim, but not the appeal to the supreme court since the plaintiffs’ appeal\n\nwas solely based on the unsuccessful claims. Since the sales tax issue was a minor one in view of\n\nthe complex issues involved in this case, the court found 25 hours compensable.\n\n\n¶ 17   The circuit court determined that TMCC’s 16-year delay in stipulating as to the validity\n\nof Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim required compensation for some but not all the hours\n\nsought. To compensate for the effort to prompt the situation and the summary judgment on Ms.\n\nKemp’s claim, the court awarded 10% of the hours requested or 33.3 hours, between 2008 and\n\nthe 2011 appeal (Robinson III). The circuit court found a total of 76.4 hours was reasonably\n\nnecessary for Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim.\n\n\n¶ 18   The circuit court calculated the attorney fees at the $395 per hour rate requested by Ms.\n\nKemp’s attorney, noting that it had already removed the unsuccessful and unreasonable hours.\n\nThe court stated that the hourly rate included overhead, which was “standard.” The court refused\n\nto order reimbursement of costs incurred for faxing, mailing, photocopying, binding “or other\n\nexpenses in bringing this case.” The court further refused to order any reimbursement for costs\n\nincurred since the appeal of the June 10, 2011, order since the appeal was completely\n\nunsuccessful.\n                                                6\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114 \n\n\n¶ 19   The circuit court summarized its findings as follows:\n\n\n\n               “Having reviewed Plaintiffs’ fee petitions, all briefs and documents filed by both\n\n       sides for the fee petition, the record of this case, and having taken into account, among\n\n       other things, the nature of this case, the expertise of legal counsel, the amount involved,\n\n       and the results obtained, the court finds the amount of time spent by Plaintiffs’ counsel\n\n       vastly exceeds what is reasonable. Further, even that amount awarded in the previous\n\n       hearing would now be unreasonable given Plaintiffs’ continued losses. The court thus\n\n       rejects the inclusion of any compensable time since the last appeal, due to Plaintiffs’\n\n       astonishing lack of success there. The time spent between 1995 and 2008 attempting to\n\n       certify a class of two-time opt-outs is similarly rejected as unreasonable expense. All\n\n       work for the joint claims that were lost on the most recent appeal is considered both\n\n       severable and severed from the successful claim and therefore is not compensated. This\n\n       includes the appeal to the supreme court; despite the fact that the plaintiffs ‘won’ there, it\n\n       was only on reversing the dismissal of the unsuccessful claims, the last of which\n\n       ultimately failed on the second appeal.\n\n\n               What is compensable is 10% of the time involved with the first appeal in which\n\n       the dismissal of [Ms. Kemp’s] successful tax claim was reversed and 10% of the time\n\n       since this case was transferred to the municipal district as well as all work considered to\n\n       be put distinctly towards the tax issue. In total, the court awards $30,178 in attorney’s\n\n       fees for 76.4 hours worked at $395 per hour. The court also awards all Cook County\n\n       filing fees that are unrelated to the failed appeals as well as the costs of service of\n                                                  7\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n       process. This amounts to nearly nineteen times the recovery of [Ms. Kemp], clearly\n\n       disproportionate to the amount in controversy, but also ‘roughly proportional’ to what\n\n       vindication of [Ms. Kemp’s] rights could be considered as reasonably worth and enough\n\n       to encourage skilled attorneys to take cases for consumer rights without rewarding undue\n\n       delay.”\n\n\n¶ 20   On July 20, 2015, Ms. Kemp filed a timely notice of appeal from the court’s June 19,\n\n2015, order\n\n\n¶ 21                                  ANALYSIS\n\n\n¶ 22   Under section 1640, Ms. Kemp was entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees. 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1640 (1994); see 15 USC § 1667(d) (1980). Where an action is based solely on a\n\nfederal statute, it must be determined in accordance with federal law. Cress v. Recreation\n\nServices, Inc., 341 Ill. App. 3d 149, 190 (2003).\n\n\n¶ 23                           I. Applicable Standards of Review\n\n\n¶ 24   An award of attorney fees pursuant to a fee-shifting statute is reviewed for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Jaffee v. Redmond, 142 F.3d 409, 412 (7th Cir. 1998). This deferential standard of\n\nreview “ ‘is appropriate in view of the district court’s superior understanding of the litigation and\n\nthe desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.’ ”\n\nJaffee, 142 F.3d at 412 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437). An abuse of discretion occurs “\n\n‘when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored, when an improper factor is relied\n\nupon, or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed, but the court makes a serious\n                                                    8\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nmistake in weighing them.’ ” Coutin v. Young & Rubicam Puerto Rico, Inc. 124 F.2d 331, 336\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Foster v. Mydas Associates, Inc., 943 F.2d 139, 143 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(internal quotations and citations omitted)).\n\n\n¶ 25   A court’s discretion is not without limits. Perdue, 559 U.S. at 558 (2010). “It is essential\n\nthat the judge provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of a fee determination.”\n\nPerdue, 559 U.S. at 558. While the explanation need not be painstaking, “the order awarding\n\nfees, read against the backdrop of the record as a whole, must expose the district court’s thought\n\nprocess and show the method and manner underlying its decisional calculus.” Coutin, 124 F.3d\n\nat 337. This principle is especially important in cases where the court substantially reduced the\n\ndocumented time. Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337. Otherwise, the reviewing court will be unable to\n\nconduct an adequate review and remand for further findings will be required. Coutin, 124 F.3d at\n\n337.\n\n\n¶ 26   Ms. Kemp asserts that the circuit court’s methodology in calculating attorney fee awards\n\nis reviewed de novo. See Jaffee, 142 F.3d at 412 (an alleged legal error in denying attorney fees\n\nis reviewed de novo). To the extent that the circuit court’s methodology presents a question of\n\nlaw, we agree. Jaffe, 142 F.3d at 412 (questions of law are reviewed de novo).\n\n\n¶ 27                                    II. Discussion\n\n\n¶ 28            A. Calculation of the Reasonable Amount of Attorney Fees\n\n\n                                         (Issues II and III)\n\n\n                                                 9\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n¶ 29                        1. Reliance on the Johnson Factors\n\n\n¶ 30   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred when it disregarded the lodestar and relied\n\non the factors in Johnson in its determination of a reasonable attorney fee amount. Those factors\n\nare as follows: “(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions;\n\n(3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by\n\nthe attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or\n\ncontingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount\n\ninvolved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10)\n\nthe ‘undesirability” of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with\n\nthe client; and (12) awards in similar cases.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 429-30 n.3.\n\n\n¶ 31   The lodestar method is the preferred method for determining a reasonable fee. Coutin,\n\n124 F.3d at 337. The lodestar method contemplates judicial assessment of “ ‘the number of hours\n\nreasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate’ as the starting point\n\nfor construing a fee award.” Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433). In\n\nPerdue the Supreme Court held that in determining a reasonable attorney fee, the lodestar\n\nmethod was preferred over the Johnson factors as a more objective test, permitting meaningful\n\njudicial review and producing reasonably predictable results. Perdue, 559 U.S. at 551-52.\n\nHowever, Perdue did not hold that any consideration of the Johnson factors was error. Instead,\n\n“to the extent that any of [the Johnson factors] has already been incorporated into the lodestar\n\nanalysis, we do not consider [those factors] a second time. McFee v. Boczar, 738 F.3d 81, 89\n\n\n\n                                                 10 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n(4th Cir. 2013) (quoting E. Associated Coal Corp. v. Director, OWCP, 724 F.3d 561, 570 (4th\n\nCir. 2013) (citing Perdue, 130 S. Ct. at 1673)\n\n\n¶ 32    In the present case, the circuit court’s memorandum opinion and order reflects that the\n\ncourt clearly understood the limited use of the Johnson factors, and utilized the lodestar in its\n\ncalculation of a reasonable attorney fee amount.\n\n\n¶ 33                            2. Adjustment of the Lodestar\n\n\n¶ 34    Ms. Kemp contends that the lodestar figure of $1,074,163 was the reasonable amount of\n\nattorney fees to be awarded in this case. There is a strong presumption that the lodestar figure is\n\nreasonable. Perdue, 559 U.S. at 553-54. Ms. Kemp asserts that the reasonableness of the lodestar\n\nfigure in this case is supported by the presumption and by the seven affidavits from other\n\nattorneys attesting to the reasonableness of her attorney’s hours and hourly rate. Having\n\nestablished the reasonableness of the lodestar figure, Ms. Kemp maintains that the burden of\n\nproof then shifted to MCC to prove that the lodestar figure was unreasonable. She maintains that\n\nthe circuit court failed to require TMCC to meet its burden of proof that the lodestar figure was\n\nunreasonable.\n\n\n¶ 35    The affidavits from other attorneys were filed in support of Ms. Kemp’s petition for\n\nattorney fees prior to the appeal in Robinson III, in which the plaintiffs lost all of their joint\n\nclaims. Those affidavits did not address the reasonableness of the hours spent on Ms. Kemp’s\n\nindividual CLA claim as opposed to the reasonableness of the hours spent on all of the CLA\n\n\n\n                                                   11 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nclaims raised in the plaintiffs’ lawsuit. Moreover, Ms. Kemp overlooks the circuit court’s ability\n\nto modify the initial lodestar figure.\n\n\n¶ 36   While still adhering to the time-and-rate based method in the initial lodestar calculation,\n\nthe court can “segregate time spent on unsuccessful claims, [citation], and eliminate excessive or\n\nunproductive hours,” resulting in a lodestar that differs substantially from the fee requested by\n\nthe prevailing party. Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337; see Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435. As the Court in\n\nHensley explained:\n\n\n                “The product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate does not end the inquiry.\n\n       There remain other considerations that may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward\n\n       or downward, including the important factor of the ‘results obtained.’ This factor is\n\n       particularly crucial where a plaintiff is deemed ‘prevailing’ even though he succeeded on\n\n       only some of his claims for relief. In this situation two questions must be addressed. First,\n\n       did the plaintiff fail to prevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he\n\n       succeeded? Second, did the plaintiff achieve a level of success that makes the hours\n\n       reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award?” Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n\n       434.\n\n\n¶ 37    The Court in Hensley disapproved of awarding attorney fees for unsuccessful claims that\n\nwere unrelated to the successful claims. Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1279\n\n(7th Cir. 1983). While there was no certain method of determining whether or not claims are\n\nrelated, “the starting point for separating an unrelated, unsuccessful claim from a related,\n\n\n                                                 12 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nunsuccessful claim is to determine whether a particular unsuccessful claim shares a ‘common\n\ncore of facts’ with the successful claim or is based on a ‘related legal theory.’ ” (Emphasis in\n\noriginal.) Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1279 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437 n 12). In making\n\nthat determination, the court in Mary Beth G. found it useful to focus on whether the claims\n\nsought relief for essentially the same course of conduct. Applying this analysis, the court found\n\nthat:\n\n\n        “an unsuccessful claim will be un related to a successful claim when the relief sought on\n\n        the unsuccessful claim is intended to remedy a course of conduct entirely distinct and\n\n        separate from the course of conduct that gave rise to the injury on which the relief\n\n        granted is premised.” (Emphasis in original.) Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1279.\n\n\n¶ 38    Ms. Kemp maintains that the circuit court conceded that all of the claims raised in this\n\ncase arose out of a common core of facts, but nonetheless concluded erroneously that her\n\nindividual CLA claim was unrelated to the other federal and state claims raised in the complaints\n\nfiled in this case. She further maintains that she raised only one claim which was divided into\n\nthree parts, one of which was her CLA sales tax amount. Ms. Kemp’s argument is based on a\n\nmisreading of the circuit court’s opinion in this case. The circuit court made no such concession\n\nbut merely noted this court’s reference to “the core operative facts,” in Robinson I. Robinson I,\n\n315 Ill. App. 3d at 1092 (“The core operative facts for plaintiffs’ causes of action in Ramirez\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n[Ramirez v. Toyota Motor Credit Corp., No. 752044-8] 3 and in the present case are identical-\n\nfederal [CLA] violations arising from the plaintiffs’ 1993 leases with [TMCC]”).\n\n\n¶ 39   Moreover, the plaintiffs’ joint state and federal claims were based on the failure of the\n\nmotor vehicle leases to disclose or to disclose in a meaningful sequence the penalties for early\n\ntermination of the leases. They sought to certify a class on these claims. In Robinson I, this court\n\nrecognized that Ms. Kemp’s individual claim was distinct from the other claims, finding that her\n\nclaim “was an individual claim, not common to the class.” Robinson I, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 1093.\n\nWe noted that the plaintiffs’ other CLA claims “do not involve individual claims but, rather,\n\ninvolve common issues regarding defendants’ leases.” Robinson I, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 1093. We\n\nfurther noted that those claims had the “same core of operative facts” as did the claims in\n\nRamirez. Robinson I, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 1093. Thus, as early as this court’s 2000 decision in\n\nRobinson I, there was a recognition that Ms. Kemp’s CLA sales tax claim was unrelated to the\n\nclaims for which the plaintiffs sought to certify the class. The supreme court reversed this court’s\n\ndetermination that the plaintiffs’ joint CLA claims were res judicata but declined to rule on the\n\nsubstantive sufficiency of those claims. Robinson II, 201 Ill. 2d at 416. This court’s\n\ndetermination that Ms. Kemp’s individual claim was not barred by res judicata was noted by the\n\nsupreme court, but it was not at issue in the appeal. See Robinson II, 201 Ill. 2d at 411.\n\n\n¶ 40   Ms. Kemp further argues that her CLA sales tax claim was related to the unsuccessful\n\nclaims since it was part of the failure to disclose claim. The sales tax amount was disclosed in\n\nher lease but in the wrong amount. The course of conduct aimed to be remedied in the present\n\n       3\n           The class action suit in California.\n                                                  14 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ncase was to require the authors of motor vehicle leases to make the disclosures clear and\n\nconspicuous, not to improve their arithmetic skills. Ms. Kemp’s claim was a “distinctly\n\ndifferent” claim from the plaintiffs’ joint claims. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434. Therefore, Ms.\n\nKemp’s individual claim was not related to the failure to disclose claims which were\n\nunsuccessfully litigated.\n\n\n¶ 41   Ms. Kemp agrees that in determining the reasonableness of the attorney fees, the most\n\nimportant factor is success. Ms. Kemp maintains that she achieved complete success on her\n\nindividual CLA claim in that it resulted in the enforcement of a congressional right benefiting the\n\npublic, and she received the maximum amount in damages. Relying on Hensley, she argues that\n\nthe circuit court erred by not awarding attorney fees as calculated by the lodestar.\n\n\n¶ 42   Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, a fee award should not be reduced simply\n\nbecause the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit. Hensley, 461 U.S.\n\nat 435. However, where the plaintiff achieved only partial or limited success, the product of\n\nhours spent on the litigation as a whole multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate may be an\n\nexcessive amount. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436. As the Court in Hensley observed, “Congress has\n\nnot authorized an award of fees whenever it is reasonable for a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit or\n\nwhenever conscientious counsel tried the case with skill and devotion and skill. Again, the most\n\ncritical factor is the degree of success obtained.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436 (had the plaintiffs in a\n\ncivil rights case prevailed on only one of their six general claims, a fee award based on the\n\nclaimed hours clearly would have been excessive). In other words, “where the plaintiff has\n\n\n\n                                                 15 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nachieved only limited success, the [court] “should award only that amount of fees that is\n\nreasonable in relation to the results obtained.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440.\n\n\n¶ 43    This is not a case in which Ms. Kemp, in good faith, raised alternative arguments and\n\nsucceeded on her claim even though some of those arguments were rejected. At the end of 20\n\nyears of litigation, only Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim was upheld. Her individual claim\n\nwas unrelated to the joint federal and state claims. It was those unrelated claims and ultimately\n\ncompletely unsuccessful claims that occupied the vast majority of time since the commencement\n\nof this litigation. In such a case, “the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded\n\nin considering the amount of a reasonable fee.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440. In accord with the\n\nanalysis in Hensley, Ms. Kemp’s success on her individual CLA claim did not support the award\n\nof fees initially calculated by the lodestar.\n\n\n¶ 44    Ms. Kemp’s reliance on United States Football League v. National Football League, 887\n\nF.2d 408 (2d Cir. 1989), is misplaced. In that case, the United States Football League (USNL)\n\nsucceeded on only one of its antitrust violation claims against the defendant, and the jury\n\nawarded $1 in damages. The district court trebled the damage award to $3 and awarded attorney\n\nfees of $5.5 million. On review, the court of appeals observed that the USFL claims involved a\n\ncommon core of facts. United States Football League, 887 F.2d at 414. In affirming the district\n\ncourt’s determination of a reasonable amount of attorney fees, the court noted that the USFL had\n\n“exercised billing judgment and in recognition of its limited success, the USFL had already\n\nreduced the basic lodestar by 20%.” United States Football League, 887 F.2d at 415. In\n\naddition, the USFL had used historic billing rates rather than current ones and understated the\n                                                16 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ntime actually spent on the litigation. United States Football League, 887 F.2d at 415. The district\n\ncourt reduced the lodestar amount by an additional 30%—10% for vague entries and 20% for the\n\nUSFL for its limited success. United States Football League, 887 F.2d at 415. The court of\n\nappeals found no abuse of discretion where the district court did not exclude specific hours spent\n\non matters not fully compensable, instead choosing to reduce the lodestar. United States Football\n\nLeague, 887 F.2d at 414; see Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37 (the reviewing court may attempt to\n\nidentify specific hours that should be eliminated or simply reduce the award to account for\n\nlimited success).\n\n\n¶ 45   Unlike United States Football League, the present case does not involve related claims.\n\nThe circuit court found that Ms. Kemp’s counsel made no effort to cull time from his billing\n\nrecords. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434 (the prevailing party’s counsel should make a good-faith\n\neffort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive redundant or otherwise\n\nunnecessary). Moreover, contrary to her own argument, United States Football League supports\n\nthe use of reducing the size of the award by a percentage amount to achieve a reasonable amount\n\nof attorney fees.\n\n\n¶ 46   Next, Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred when it failed to consider the\n\namount of attorney fees incurred by TMCC in determining the reasonableness of the fees. The\n\nfederal courts disagree over the relevance of opposing counsel’s billing records in the\n\ndetermination of a reasonable attorney fee award. Some courts have found them relevant and\n\nprobative, while other have found them either irrelevant or of little relevance. See Marks\n\nConstruction Co. v. Huntington National Bank, No. 1-05 CV 73 (N.D. W.V. 2010) (collecting\n                                                17 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ncases); see also Diecher v. City of Evansville, Wisconsin, 545 F.3d 537 (7th Cir. 2010) (in dicta,\n\nthe reviewing court found such records relevant); Schlacher v. Law Offices of Phillip J. Roche &\n\nAssociates, P.C., 574 F.3d 852 (7th Cir. 2009) (no abuse of discretion in denying motion to\n\nproduce billing records where case was resolved quickly); Farfaras v. Citizens Bank & Trust Co.\n\nof Chicago, 433 F.3d 558 (7th Cir. 2006) (records were relevant, but the district court was able to\n\ndetermine a reasonable fee without them); Quinones v. City of Evanston, No. 91 C 3291 (N.D.\n\nIll. 1995) (relevant, but both parties were seeking attorney fees).\n\n\n¶ 47   The amount of attorney fees spent by a defendant may be relevant in a fee-shifting case.\n\nNonetheless, it was of little relevancy here. According to Ms. Kemp, the circuit court\n\nacknowledged that TMCC probably spent over $1 million but ignored that factor in determining\n\nwhether her attorney fees of in excess of $1 million was reasonable. However, the attorney fee\n\naward was limited to the attorney fees incurred in Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim. Therefore,\n\nthe fact that TMCC spent $1 million in defending against the plaintiffs’ lawsuit was not relevant\n\nto what a reasonable amount of attorney fees in litigating Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim.\n\n\n¶ 48   Ms. Kemp complains that the circuit court ignored the difficulty in litigating consumer\n\ncases and reduced her attorney fees because it considered the issue in her case as having a lower\n\ndifficulty and novelty factor and required less skill. In its opinion and order, the circuit court\n\nnoted that compared to other cases involving police use of excessive force, involuntarily\n\ncommitted patients, Ms. Kemp’s case which involved the wrong amount of sales tax, was “much\n\nmore mundane.” However, the court agreed it was not its place to draw a distinction between\n\ncivil rights and consumer rights. In the end, what matters was that the attorney fee be reasonable.\n                                                  18 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nThe circuit court’s award of attorney fees was reasonable in light of Ms. Kemp’s one successful\n\nclaim.\n\n\n¶ 49     Finally, Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court disregarded the admonishment in\n\nPerdue and erroneously applied a Johnson factor, i.e., the attorney’s ability and reputation, in\n\ndetermining the reasonableness of the fee amount. She points to the circuit court’s references to\n\nother cases in which her attorney’s performance on behalf of other clients was criticized and that\n\nthe court ignored the seven uncontested affidavits in determining a reasonable fee.\n\n\n¶ 50     In Perdue, the Supreme Court stated that “the quality of an attorney’s performance\n\ngenerally should not be used to adjust the lodestar ‘[b]ecause considerations concerning the\n\nquality of a prevailing party’s counsel’s representation normally are reflected in the reasonable\n\nhourly rate.’ ” Perdue, 559 U.S. at 553 (quoting Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizen’s\n\nCouncil for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 565, 566 (1986)). The circuit court correctly noted in its\n\nmemorandum and order that the Johnson factor of an attorney’s ability and reputation is\n\nconsidered in the lodestar calculation. In any event, notwithstanding the negative references, the\n\ncircuit court granted Ms. Kemp’s request that her attorney’s hourly rate be set at $395.\n\n\n¶ 51     It is clear from the circuit court’s memorandum opinion that it used the lodestar in\n\ncalculating a reasonable attorney fee award in this case. The court’s reference to the factors in\n\nJohnson were clearly in line with the limited use of those factors as expressed by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Perdue. Accordingly, no error of law occurred in the circuit court’s application of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nlodestar, and we find no abuse of discretion in the court’s determination of the amount of\n\nreasonable attorney fees due Ms. Kemp in this case.\n\n\n¶ 52            B. Costs, Fee Petition Proceedings, and Arbitrary Fee Reduction\n\n\n                                              (Issue I)\n\n\n¶ 53                                           1. Costs\n\n\n¶ 54   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred by refusing to reimburse her for such costs\n\nas photocopying, mailing, and binding of materials. She maintains that federal law requires that\n\nshe be reimbursed for these costs. See 15 U.S.C. § 1640(a)(3) (2010) (a creditor is liable for “in\n\nthe case of any successful action to enforce liability *** the costs of the action, together with a\n\nreasonable attorney’s fee as determined by the court”). In reviewing an award of costs, the court\n\ndetermines, first, whether the costs are recoverable, and second whether the costs are reasonable,\n\nboth in amount and necessity. Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1282.\n\n\n¶ 55   Ms. Kemp relies on several cases which she argues establish that the costs disallowed by\n\nthe circuit court were in fact recoverable in this case. In Abrams v. Lightolier, Inc., 50 F.3d 1204\n\n(3d Cir. 1995), the district court limited the amount of costs to be reimbursed finding that\n\nplaintiff had been adequately compensated by the generous attorney fee awards. Abrams, 50\n\nF.3d at 1222-23. On review, the court of appeals reversed finding that the district court had\n\napplied the wrong standard. On remand, the district court was ordered to determine which\n\nexpenses were considered “overhead” and thus included in an award of attorney fees and which\n\nexpenses were considered the cost of litigation and recoverable as costs. Abrams, 50 F.3d at\n                                                 20 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n1224-26. Unlike the district court in Abrams, in the present case, the circuit court refused to\n\nreimburse Ms. Kemp for items which it found were part of the overhead and included in the\n\nattorney’s hourly rate.\n\n\n¶ 56   In Miller v. Alamo, 983 F.2d 856 (8th Cir. 1993), the court construed a different federal\n\ncosts statute. The court of appeals found that costs such as traveling, mailing and photocopying\n\nwere recoverable under 26 U.S.C § 7340 (20__), which allowed as costs out-of-pocket expenses\n\nwhich for lawyers normally billed their clients separately. Miller, 983 F.2d. at 862.\n\n\n¶ 57   In Burda v. M. Ecker Co., 2 F.3d 769 (7th Cir. 1993), the court of appeals held that the\n\n$505.74 in costs for photocopying, postage, telephone and delivery charges, and computerized\n\nlegal research were fully documented and properly recoverable by a prevailing party under\n\nsection 28 U.S.C § 1920. The court found no basis for disturbing the district court’s award of\n\ncosts. Burda, 2 F.3d at 778.\n\n\n¶ 58   Even when costs are statutorily recoverable, the reviewing court applies the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard to whether the costs were reasonable and necessary. Cengr v. Flusibond\n\nPiping Systems, Inc., 135 F.3d 445, 454 (7th Cir. 1998). In light of this highly deferential\n\nstandard, we must credit the circuit court with a familiarity with this case that eclipses our own.\n\nThe circuit court was in the best place to determine the reasonableness and necessity for the\n\nexpenses for which Ms. Kemp sought reimbursement. This is not a case where the court applied\n\nthe wrong standard or failed to explain for the benefit of the reviewing court the denial of an\n\naward of costs. Instead, the circuit court set forth its reasoning in detail for declining to award\n\n\n                                                  21 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ncertain costs to Ms. Kemp. Just as the court in Burda upheld the district court’s ruling awarding\n\ncosts, we find no basis for disturbing the circuit court’s refusal to reimburse Ms. Kemp for the\n\nadditional costs she sought.\n\n\n¶ 59                           2. Denial of Fees for Fee Petition Proceeding\n\n\n¶ 60   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred when it denied her attorney fees for the\n\nfee petition proceeding. Ms. Kemp devotes one paragraph to her contention and limits her\n\nargument to stating that “[t]he lower court denied compensation for the fee petition proceeding,”\n\nand suggesting that this court “might decide to remand.” She relies on three federal cases which\n\nstand for the general proposition that the time spent on establishing the right and amount of the\n\nfee is compensable but are otherwise distinguishable from the case before us. See Camacho v.\n\nBridgeport Financial, Inc., 523 F.3d 973, 981 (9th Cir. 2008) (remand for a redetermination of\n\nthe fees on fees employing the proper standard where the district court used the lodestar and a\n\nflat amount; Bond v. Stanton, 630 F.2d 1231 (7th Cir. 1980) ( a fee on fee award could not\n\ndefeated by the fact that the defendants’ argument contesting the fee award had merit); Prandini\n\nv. National Tea Co., 585 F.2d 47, 54 (3d Cir. 1978) (appellant attorneys were entitled to be\n\ncompensated “to the extent that time was reasonably necessary to obtaining a reasonable fee\n\naward).\n\n\n¶ 61   None of the above fact situations are present in the case before us. In the present case, the\n\ntrial court did not deny Ms. Kemp an award for the time spent establishing the right to an\n\nattorney fee award because it believed that time spent to procure an attorney fees award was not\n\n\n                                                22 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ncompensatory, or because TMCC had a “good-faith” argument to oppose an award of attorney\n\nfees, or because the trial court’s methodology in determining a fee on fee award was\n\ninconsistent.\n\n\n¶ 62   Moreover, those cases address the specific denial for compensation for time spent in\n\nestablishing the right to an award of fees. The trial court awarded Ms. Kemp attorney fees and\n\ncosts for her successful individual CLA claim. The court denied any fees or costs incurred after\n\nJune 10, 2011, in light of the unsuccessful appeal in Robinson III. In Bond, the court recognized\n\nthat the award of attorney fees would be subject to potential dilution unless the efforts of\n\nsuccessful plaintiffs to obtain fees are includable in a fee award. Bond, 630 F.2d at 1236. Since\n\nnone of the fees and costs incurred after June 10, 2011, were awarded on the basis of the lack of\n\nsuccess, Ms. Kemp fails to persuade us that she is entitled to compensation for preparing a fee\n\npetition for work for which the trial court denied compensation.\n\n\n¶ 63                           3. Arbitrary Denial of Attorney Fees\n\n\n¶ 64   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred when it cut 97% of the attorney fees she\n\nrequested without referring to specific time entries. She cites several cases for the proposition\n\nthat a court must not cut attorney fees by applying an arbitrary percentage. In Heiar v. Crawford\n\nCounty, Wisconsin, 746 F.2d 1190 (7th Cir. 1984), the district court determined that the attorney\n\nfee amount sought was excessive and cut the fees by 50%. The court of appeals held that such a\n\nmethod might be appropriate where the fee amount was small. However, where the amount\n\nrequested was in excess of $50,000,\n\n\n                                                 23 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n        “the judge must do more than eyeball the request and if it seems excessive cut it down\n\n        by an arbitrary percentage. He has to make a judgment — considering the nature of the\n\n        case and the details of the request, taking evidence if need be, and defending his\n\n        judgment in a reasoned (though brief) opinion – on what the case should have cost the\n\n        party who submitted the request.” Heiar, 746 F.2d at 1204.\n\n\n¶ 65    Nonetheless, where a party has achieved only limited success, the court may attempt to\n\nidentify specific hours that should be eliminated or it may simply reduce the award to account for\n\nthe limited success. Hensley, 461 U.S. 436-37. While the circuit court did not specify each entry\n\nit determined was excessive, the court detailed its reasoning for eliminating work which was\n\nunrelated to Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim or was otherwise not compensable. See Hensley,\n\n461 U.S. at 437 (when adjusting the amount of attorney fees on the basis of the limited nature of\n\nthe relief, the court should make clear that it considered the relationship between the amount of\n\nthe fees awarded and the results obtained). That the circuit court did so in this case is amply\n\ndemonstrated by its memorandum opinion and order.\n\n\n¶ 66    In sum, we find no error or abuse of discretion in the circuit court’s award of costs, its\n\ndenial of fees for the fee petition proceedings, and we find that the circuit court did not act\n\narbitrarily in its reduction of the attorney fees in this case.\n\n\n¶ 67                             D. Denial of Fees for Appellate Work\n\n\n                                               (Issue IV)\n\n\n\n                                                   24 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n¶ 68   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred in denying her attorney fees for any of the\n\nappellate work this case. Ms. Kemp argues that the circuit court’s denial of the fees was based on\n\nthe lack of success instead of whether it was reasonable for her to pursue an appeal. People Who\n\nCare v. Rockford Board of Education, School District No. 205, 90 F.3d 1307, 1314 (7th Cir.\n\n1996) (the court’s focus should be on the reasonableness of the attorney’s actions rather than the\n\nsuccess or failure of the actions).\n\n\n¶ 69   We need not determine the reasonableness of the plaintiffs’ decision to appeal from the\n\ncircuit court’s June 10, 2011, order. In Robinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889, this court’s\n\nremand was limited to a determination of an award of attorney fees and costs on Ms. Kemp’s\n\nindividual CLA claim. Robinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889 ¶ 84. Ms. Kemp’s assertion that\n\nas a result of the appeal in Robinson III, she won her individual claim and an award of attorney\n\nfees and costs on that claim is belied by the record. Her individual claim was not at issue, and it\n\nwas necessary to remand for an award of fees because the fee award we vacated included fees for\n\nthe joint claims that had been reversed. Robinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889 ¶ 84.\n\n\n¶ 70   As to the first appeal in this case (Robinson I), Ms. Kemp argues that the circuit court\n\nerred in refusing to compensate her for the time her attorney spent to protect her claim between\n\n1995 and 2008. In Cabrales v. County of Los Angeles, 935 F.2d 1050 (9th Cir. 1991), the court\n\nof appeals held that plaintiffs should be compensated for attorney fees incurred for services that\n\ncontribute to the ultimate victory in the lawsuit. Cabrales, 935 F.2d at 1052. “[E]ven if a specific\n\nclaim failed, the time spent on that claim may be compensable, in full or in part, if it contributes\n\nto the success of the other claims.” Cabrales, 935 F.2d at 1052 (citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435).\n                                                 25 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n¶ 71   Contrary to Ms. Kemp’s argument, the circuit court found that time spent in 1998\n\ndefending against the dismissal of her individual claim in the circuit court and the appeal\n\n(Robinson I) where the dismissal of her individual claim was reversed was compensable. The\n\ncourt found that the time spent on the appeal to the supreme court was not compensable. We\n\nagree since only the joint claims were at issue in that appeal. See Robinson II, 201 Ill. 2d at 405\n\n(the issues before the court were whether the joint claims were barred by res judicata and\n\nwhether the plaintiffs had stated a cause of action under the Consumer Fraud Act); see also\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35 (prevailing party was not entitled to compensation for attorney fees\n\nexpended on ultimately unsuccessful claims).\n\n\n¶ 72    Ms. Kemp argues that she is entitled to attorney fees for the appeal to supreme court\n\nbecause the plaintiffs achieved a benefit for Illinois consumers in that the supreme court reduced\n\nthe number of factors consumers must prove in order to succeed on an unfair practices claim\n\nunder the Consumer Fraud Act. See Robinson II, 201 Ill. 2d at 418. However, the CFA claims\n\nwere joint, and the supreme court’s ruling did not benefit Ms. Kemp’s individual claim.\n\n\n¶ 73   The circuit court considered that Ms. Kemp’s individual claim was an extremely minor\n\none compared with issues on the plaintiffs’ joint claims raised in Robinson I, and awarded 25\n\nhours, or 10% of the total hours claimed. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37 (trial court has the\n\ndiscretion to eliminate specific hours or simply reduce the award to account for the limited\n\nsuccess).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n¶ 74   In sum, we find no abuse of discretion by the circuit court in its determination of the\n\ncompensable time with regard to the appellate proceedings in this case.\n\n\n¶ 75                                  CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n¶ 76   For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n¶ 77   Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                27 \n\n\f",

The\n\nsole issue on appeal is whether the circuit court erred in its determination of the amount of\n\nreimbursable attorney fees and costs it awarded to Ms. Kemp.\n\n\n¶2        Ms. Kemp challenges the award on several grounds. For clarity sake we address Ms.\n\nKemp’s arguments as follows: (1) whether the circuit court applied the wrong methodology in\n\ncalculating the amount of reimbursable attorney fees; (2) whether the circuit court erred when it;\n\n(a) reduced the amount of costs requested by Ms. Kemp, (b) denied her request for attorney fees\n\nincurred for the fee petition proceeding, and (c) arbitrarily reduced her attorney fees request; and\n\n(3) whether the circuit court erred when it failed to award fees for the appellate proceedings.\n\n\n¶3                                      BACKGROUND\n\n\n¶4                                      I.

We will confine our recitation of the facts to those pertinent to the issues raised in the present\n\nappeal.\n\n\n¶6        Beginning with their original complaint filed in 1995, the plaintiffs, Ms. Kemp and\n\nEmma J. Robinson (Ms. Robinson or collectively, the plaintiffs), sought damages and attorney\n\nfees and costs for violations of federal and state law related to the motor vehicle leasing\n                                                   2\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nagreements they entered into with the defendants, Point One Toyota, Evanston, Toyota Motor\n\nCredit Corporation, and River Oaks Toyota. In their complaint and amended complaints, the\n\nplaintiffs alleged that various provisions of the motor vehicle leases violated the CLA, the\n\nIllinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (Consumer Fraud Act) (815 ILCS\n\n505/1 et seq. (West 1992)) and the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (815 ILCS 510/1et\n\nseq. (West 1992)). The plaintiffs also sought certification as a class action. In addition to her\n\njoint CLA claims with Ms. Robinson, in the first amended complaint, Ms. Kemp alleged an\n\nindividual claim under the CLA based on the failure to disclose the actual amount of the sales tax\n\nowed under her vehicle lease.\n\n\n¶7     By 2011, all that remained of their lawsuit were the plaintiffs’ joint CLA claims and Ms.\n\nKemp’s individual CLA claim. Following the filing of a third amended complaint and a hearing\n\non the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court granted summary\n\njudgment to the plaintiffs on their CLA lease termination and itemization of other charges claims\n\nand Ms. Kemp’s CLA individual claim. The court granted summary judgment to the defendants,\n\nTMCC and River Oaks Toyota (collectively TMCC) 1 on the plaintiffs’ default penalties claim.\n\nRobinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889, ¶ 11. Following an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court\n\ndenied the plaintiffs’ request for actual damages on their joint CLA claims but granted actual\n\ndamages to Ms. Kemp on her individual CLA claim. The court awarded Ms. Robinson statutory\n\ndamages of $1,000, and Ms. Kemp $1,596, in statutory and actual damages based on the failure\n\nto disclose. Ms. Kemp’s award reflected a reduction of the $500 set-off she received from\n\n\n       1\n           Point One Toyota, Evanston was not a party in Robinson III and it is not a party in this appeal.\n                                                           3\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114 \n\n\ndefendant Point One Toyota, Evanston. Robinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889, ¶ 12. The\n\n\ncircuit court awarded the plaintiffs $113,280 in attorney fees and costs of $420. Robinson III, \n\n\n2012 IL App (1st) 111889, ¶ 13. The plaintiffs appealed, and the defendants cross-appealed.\n\n\n\n¶8     On review, this court held that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on all \n\n\nof the plaintiffs’ joint claims under the CLA. We vacated the damages and attorney fees and \n\n\ncosts awarded to the plaintiffs on their joint CLA claims. We affirmed the actual and statutory\n\n\ndamages award to Ms. Kemp on her individual CLA claim. The case was remanded to the circuit\n\n\ncourt for a hearing on attorney fees and costs but only as to Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim.\n\n\nRobinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889, ¶ 84.\n\n\n\n¶9                             II. Proceedings on Remand to the Circuit Court\n\n\n\n¶ 10                                   A. The Fee Petition\n\n\n\n¶ 11   Ms. Kemp sought an award of attorney fees in the amount of $1,074,163 based on 2719.4 \n\n\nhours and at a rate of $395 per hour and an award of costs in the amount of $11,328.74. In \n\n\nresponse, TMCC maintained that the attorney fee award should be based on a rate of $300 per\n\n\nhour for the10.5 hours that could reasonably be said to have been spent on Ms. Kemp’s single\n\n\nsuccessful CLA claim.\n\n\n\n¶ 12                                   B. The Circuit Court’s Ruling\n\n\n\n¶ 13   On June 19, 2015, the circuit court issued its memorandum opinion and order. After\n\n\nreviewing the history of the litigation, the court noted that despite the small amount of her \n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nrecovery, Ms. Kemp was entitled to “reasonable” attorney fees under the CLA. 15 U.S.C. §1640\n\n(1994).\n\n\n¶ 14      The circuit court observed that such amount was determined by “ ‘the number of hours\n\nreasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonably hourly rate,’ ” or the lodestar\n\nfigure. 2 While the Supreme Court in Hensley recommended applying the 12 factors set forth in\n\nJohnson v.

Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434. The court\n\ndistinguished the failed joint CLA claims from Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim, finding that it\n\nfit what the Court in Hensley described as a “distinctly different claim.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n\n434. The circuit court determined that to allow fees to be recovered for Ms. Robinson’s claims\n\nonly because of the success of Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim, which was not even at issue,\n\nwas “not only illogical, but clearly against Congress’s intent in limiting attorney’s fee awards to\n\nsuccessful claims.” In light of the total lack of success, the court ruled that no time after June\n\n2011 would be compensated.\n\n          2\n              See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (1983)).\n                                                           5\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n¶ 16   The circuit court awarded the 10.5 hours, which TMCC identified as work on Ms.\n\nKemp’s claim. The court determined that between 1995 and 1996, 7.6 hours were specifically\n\ndevoted to her claim. The circuit court determined that Ms. Kemp was entitled to be\n\ncompensated for time expended in the circuit court in 1998 contesting the dismissal motion,\n\nwhich included her sales tax claim and in the first appeal since the appeal was “a necessary step”\n\ntoward preserving her claim, but not the appeal to the supreme court since the plaintiffs’ appeal\n\nwas solely based on the unsuccessful claims. Since the sales tax issue was a minor one in view of\n\nthe complex issues involved in this case, the court found 25 hours compensable.\n\n\n¶ 17   The circuit court determined that TMCC’s 16-year delay in stipulating as to the validity\n\nof Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim required compensation for some but not all the hours\n\nsought. To compensate for the effort to prompt the situation and the summary judgment on Ms.\n\nKemp’s claim, the court awarded 10% of the hours requested or 33.3 hours, between 2008 and\n\nthe 2011 appeal (Robinson III). The circuit court found a total of 76.4 hours was reasonably\n\nnecessary for Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim.\n\n\n¶ 18   The circuit court calculated the attorney fees at the $395 per hour rate requested by Ms.\n\nKemp’s attorney, noting that it had already removed the unsuccessful and unreasonable hours.\n\nThe court stated that the hourly rate included overhead, which was “standard.” The court refused\n\nto order reimbursement of costs incurred for faxing, mailing, photocopying, binding “or other\n\nexpenses in bringing this case.” The court further refused to order any reimbursement for costs\n\nincurred since the appeal of the June 10, 2011, order since the appeal was completely\n\nunsuccessful.\n                                                6\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114 \n\n\n¶ 19   The circuit court summarized its findings as follows:\n\n\n\n               “Having reviewed Plaintiffs’ fee petitions, all briefs and documents filed by both\n\n       sides for the fee petition, the record of this case, and having taken into account, among\n\n       other things, the nature of this case, the expertise of legal counsel, the amount involved,\n\n       and the results obtained, the court finds the amount of time spent by Plaintiffs’ counsel\n\n       vastly exceeds what is reasonable. Further, even that amount awarded in the previous\n\n       hearing would now be unreasonable given Plaintiffs’ continued losses. The court thus\n\n       rejects the inclusion of any compensable time since the last appeal, due to Plaintiffs’\n\n       astonishing lack of success there. The time spent between 1995 and 2008 attempting to\n\n       certify a class of two-time opt-outs is similarly rejected as unreasonable expense. All\n\n       work for the joint claims that were lost on the most recent appeal is considered both\n\n       severable and severed from the successful claim and therefore is not compensated. This\n\n       includes the appeal to the supreme court; despite the fact that the plaintiffs ‘won’ there, it\n\n       was only on reversing the dismissal of the unsuccessful claims, the last of which\n\n       ultimately failed on the second appeal.\n\n\n               What is compensable is 10% of the time involved with the first appeal in which\n\n       the dismissal of [Ms. Kemp’s] successful tax claim was reversed and 10% of the time\n\n       since this case was transferred to the municipal district as well as all work considered to\n\n       be put distinctly towards the tax issue. In total, the court awards $30,178 in attorney’s\n\n       fees for 76.4 hours worked at $395 per hour. The court also awards all Cook County\n\n       filing fees that are unrelated to the failed appeals as well as the costs of service of\n                                                  7\n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n       process. This amounts to nearly nineteen times the recovery of [Ms. Kemp], clearly\n\n       disproportionate to the amount in controversy, but also ‘roughly proportional’ to what\n\n       vindication of [Ms. Kemp’s] rights could be considered as reasonably worth and enough\n\n       to encourage skilled attorneys to take cases for consumer rights without rewarding undue\n\n       delay.”\n\n\n¶ 20   On July 20, 2015, Ms. Kemp filed a timely notice of appeal from the court’s June 19,\n\n2015, order\n\n\n¶ 21                                  ANALYSIS\n\n\n¶ 22   Under section 1640, Ms. Kemp was entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees. 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1640 (1994); see 15 USC § 1667(d) (1980).

While the explanation need not be painstaking, “the order awarding\n\nfees, read against the backdrop of the record as a whole, must expose the district court’s thought\n\nprocess and show the method and manner underlying its decisional calculus.” Coutin, 124 F.3d\n\nat 337. This principle is especially important in cases where the court substantially reduced the\n\ndocumented time. Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337. Otherwise, the reviewing court will be unable to\n\nconduct an adequate review and remand for further findings will be required. Coutin, 124 F.3d at\n\n337.\n\n\n¶ 26   Ms. Kemp asserts that the circuit court’s methodology in calculating attorney fee awards\n\nis reviewed de novo. See Jaffee, 142 F.3d at 412 (an alleged legal error in denying attorney fees\n\nis reviewed de novo). To the extent that the circuit court’s methodology presents a question of\n\nlaw, we agree.

Reliance on the Johnson Factors\n\n\n¶ 30   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred when it disregarded the lodestar and relied\n\non the factors in Johnson in its determination of a reasonable attorney fee amount. Those factors\n\nare as follows: “(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions;\n\n(3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by\n\nthe attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or\n\ncontingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount\n\ninvolved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10)\n\nthe ‘undesirability” of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with\n\nthe client; and (12) awards in similar cases.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 429-30 n.3.\n\n\n¶ 31   The lodestar method is the preferred method for determining a reasonable fee. Coutin,\n\n124 F.3d at 337. The lodestar method contemplates judicial assessment of “ ‘the number of hours\n\nreasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate’ as the starting point\n\nfor construing a fee award.” Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433). In\n\nPerdue the Supreme Court held that in determining a reasonable attorney fee, the lodestar\n\nmethod was preferred over the Johnson factors as a more objective test, permitting meaningful\n\njudicial review and producing reasonably predictable results. Perdue, 559 U.S. at 551-52.\n\nHowever, Perdue did not hold that any consideration of the Johnson factors was error. Instead,\n\n“to the extent that any of [the Johnson factors] has already been incorporated into the lodestar\n\nanalysis, we do not consider [those factors] a second time. McFee v.

Ct. at 1673)\n\n\n¶ 32    In the present case, the circuit court’s memorandum opinion and order reflects that the\n\ncourt clearly understood the limited use of the Johnson factors, and utilized the lodestar in its\n\ncalculation of a reasonable attorney fee amount.\n\n\n¶ 33                            2. Adjustment of the Lodestar\n\n\n¶ 34    Ms. Kemp contends that the lodestar figure of $1,074,163 was the reasonable amount of\n\nattorney fees to be awarded in this case. There is a strong presumption that the lodestar figure is\n\nreasonable. Perdue, 559 U.S. at 553-54. Ms. Kemp asserts that the reasonableness of the lodestar\n\nfigure in this case is supported by the presumption and by the seven affidavits from other\n\nattorneys attesting to the reasonableness of her attorney’s hours and hourly rate. Having\n\nestablished the reasonableness of the lodestar figure, Ms. Kemp maintains that the burden of\n\nproof then shifted to MCC to prove that the lodestar figure was unreasonable. She maintains that\n\nthe circuit court failed to require TMCC to meet its burden of proof that the lodestar figure was\n\nunreasonable.\n\n\n¶ 35    The affidavits from other attorneys were filed in support of Ms. Kemp’s petition for\n\nattorney fees prior to the appeal in Robinson III, in which the plaintiffs lost all of their joint\n\nclaims. Those affidavits did not address the reasonableness of the hours spent on Ms. Kemp’s\n\nindividual CLA claim as opposed to the reasonableness of the hours spent on all of the CLA\n\n\n\n                                                   11 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nclaims raised in the plaintiffs’ lawsuit. Moreover, Ms. Kemp overlooks the circuit court’s ability\n\nto modify the initial lodestar figure.\n\n\n¶ 36   While still adhering to the time-and-rate based method in the initial lodestar calculation,\n\nthe court can “segregate time spent on unsuccessful claims, [citation], and eliminate excessive or\n\nunproductive hours,” resulting in a lodestar that differs substantially from the fee requested by\n\nthe prevailing party. Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337; see Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435. As the Court in\n\nHensley explained:\n\n\n                “The product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate does not end the inquiry.\n\n       There remain other considerations that may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward\n\n       or downward, including the important factor of the ‘results obtained.’ This factor is\n\n       particularly crucial where a plaintiff is deemed ‘prevailing’ even though he succeeded on\n\n       only some of his claims for relief. In this situation two questions must be addressed. First,\n\n       did the plaintiff fail to prevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he\n\n       succeeded? Second, did the plaintiff achieve a level of success that makes the hours\n\n       reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award?” Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n\n       434.\n\n\n¶ 37    The Court in Hensley disapproved of awarding attorney fees for unsuccessful claims that\n\nwere unrelated to the successful claims. Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1279\n\n(7th Cir. 1983). While there was no certain method of determining whether or not claims are\n\nrelated, “the starting point for separating an unrelated, unsuccessful claim from a related,\n\n\n                                                 12 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nunsuccessful claim is to determine whether a particular unsuccessful claim shares a ‘common\n\ncore of facts’ with the successful claim or is based on a ‘related legal theory.’ ” (Emphasis in\n\noriginal.) Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1279 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437 n 12). In making\n\nthat determination, the court in Mary Beth G. found it useful to focus on whether the claims\n\nsought relief for essentially the same course of conduct. Applying this analysis, the court found\n\nthat:\n\n\n        “an unsuccessful claim will be un related to a successful claim when the relief sought on\n\n        the unsuccessful claim is intended to remedy a course of conduct entirely distinct and\n\n        separate from the course of conduct that gave rise to the injury on which the relief\n\n        granted is premised.” (Emphasis in original.) Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1279.\n\n\n¶ 38    Ms. Kemp maintains that the circuit court conceded that all of the claims raised in this\n\ncase arose out of a common core of facts, but nonetheless concluded erroneously that her\n\nindividual CLA claim was unrelated to the other federal and state claims raised in the complaints\n\nfiled in this case. She further maintains that she raised only one claim which was divided into\n\nthree parts, one of which was her CLA sales tax amount. Ms. Kemp’s argument is based on a\n\nmisreading of the circuit court’s opinion in this case. The circuit court made no such concession\n\nbut merely noted this court’s reference to “the core operative facts,” in Robinson I. Robinson I,\n\n315 Ill. App. 3d at 1092 (“The core operative facts for plaintiffs’ causes of action in Ramirez\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n[Ramirez v. Toyota Motor Credit Corp., No. 752044-8] 3 and in the present case are identical-\n\nfederal [CLA] violations arising from the plaintiffs’ 1993 leases with [TMCC]”).\n\n\n¶ 39   Moreover, the plaintiffs’ joint state and federal claims were based on the failure of the\n\nmotor vehicle leases to disclose or to disclose in a meaningful sequence the penalties for early\n\ntermination of the leases. They sought to certify a class on these claims. In Robinson I, this court\n\nrecognized that Ms. Kemp’s individual claim was distinct from the other claims, finding that her\n\nclaim “was an individual claim, not common to the class.” Robinson I, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 1093.\n\nWe noted that the plaintiffs’ other CLA claims “do not involve individual claims but, rather,\n\ninvolve common issues regarding defendants’ leases.” Robinson I, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 1093. We\n\nfurther noted that those claims had the “same core of operative facts” as did the claims in\n\nRamirez. Robinson I, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 1093. Thus, as early as this court’s 2000 decision in\n\nRobinson I, there was a recognition that Ms. Kemp’s CLA sales tax claim was unrelated to the\n\nclaims for which the plaintiffs sought to certify the class. The supreme court reversed this court’s\n\ndetermination that the plaintiffs’ joint CLA claims were res judicata but declined to rule on the\n\nsubstantive sufficiency of those claims. Robinson II, 201 Ill. 2d at 416. This court’s\n\ndetermination that Ms. Kemp’s individual claim was not barred by res judicata was noted by the\n\nsupreme court, but it was not at issue in the appeal. See Robinson II, 201 Ill. 2d at 411.\n\n\n¶ 40   Ms. Kemp further argues that her CLA sales tax claim was related to the unsuccessful\n\nclaims since it was part of the failure to disclose claim. The sales tax amount was disclosed in\n\nher lease but in the wrong amount. The course of conduct aimed to be remedied in the present\n\n       3\n           The class action suit in California.\n                                                  14 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ncase was to require the authors of motor vehicle leases to make the disclosures clear and\n\nconspicuous, not to improve their arithmetic skills. Ms. Kemp’s claim was a “distinctly\n\ndifferent” claim from the plaintiffs’ joint claims. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434. Therefore, Ms.\n\nKemp’s individual claim was not related to the failure to disclose claims which were\n\nunsuccessfully litigated.\n\n\n¶ 41   Ms. Kemp agrees that in determining the reasonableness of the attorney fees, the most\n\nimportant factor is success. Ms. Kemp maintains that she achieved complete success on her\n\nindividual CLA claim in that it resulted in the enforcement of a congressional right benefiting the\n\npublic, and she received the maximum amount in damages. Relying on Hensley, she argues that\n\nthe circuit court erred by not awarding attorney fees as calculated by the lodestar.\n\n\n¶ 42   Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, a fee award should not be reduced simply\n\nbecause the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit. Hensley, 461 U.S.\n\nat 435. However, where the plaintiff achieved only partial or limited success, the product of\n\nhours spent on the litigation as a whole multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate may be an\n\nexcessive amount. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436. As the Court in Hensley observed, “Congress has\n\nnot authorized an award of fees whenever it is reasonable for a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit or\n\nwhenever conscientious counsel tried the case with skill and devotion and skill. Again, the most\n\ncritical factor is the degree of success obtained.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436 (had the plaintiffs in a\n\ncivil rights case prevailed on only one of their six general claims, a fee award based on the\n\nclaimed hours clearly would have been excessive). In other words, “where the plaintiff has\n\n\n\n                                                 15 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nachieved only limited success, the [court] “should award only that amount of fees that is\n\nreasonable in relation to the results obtained.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440.\n\n\n¶ 43    This is not a case in which Ms. Kemp, in good faith, raised alternative arguments and\n\nsucceeded on her claim even though some of those arguments were rejected. At the end of 20\n\nyears of litigation, only Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim was upheld. Her individual claim\n\nwas unrelated to the joint federal and state claims. It was those unrelated claims and ultimately\n\ncompletely unsuccessful claims that occupied the vast majority of time since the commencement\n\nof this litigation. In such a case, “the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded\n\nin considering the amount of a reasonable fee.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440. In accord with the\n\nanalysis in Hensley, Ms. Kemp’s success on her individual CLA claim did not support the award\n\nof fees initially calculated by the lodestar.\n\n\n¶ 44    Ms. Kemp’s reliance on United States Football League v. National Football League, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530543\"><a href=\"/opinion/530543/united-states-football-league-arizona-outlaws-baltimore-stars-football/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1989), is misplaced. In that case, the United States Football League (USNL)\n\nsucceeded on only one of its antitrust violation claims against the defendant, and the jury\n\nawarded $1 in damages. The district court trebled the damage award to $3 and awarded attorney\n\nfees of $5.5 million. On review, the court of appeals observed that the USFL claims involved a\n\ncommon core of facts. United States Football League, 887 F.2d at 414. In affirming the district\n\ncourt’s determination of a reasonable amount of attorney fees, the court noted that the USFL had\n\n“exercised billing judgment and in recognition of its limited success, the USFL had already\n\nreduced the basic lodestar by 20%.” United States Football League, 887 F.2d at 415. In\n\naddition, the USFL had used historic billing rates rather than current ones and understated the\n                                                16 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ntime actually spent on the litigation. United States Football League, 887 F.2d at 415. The district\n\ncourt reduced the lodestar amount by an additional 30%—10% for vague entries and 20% for the\n\nUSFL for its limited success. United States Football League, 887 F.2d at 415. The court of\n\nappeals found no abuse of discretion where the district court did not exclude specific hours spent\n\non matters not fully compensable, instead choosing to reduce the lodestar. United States Football\n\nLeague, 887 F.2d at 414; see Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37 (the reviewing court may attempt to\n\nidentify specific hours that should be eliminated or simply reduce the award to account for\n\nlimited success).\n\n\n¶ 45   Unlike United States Football League, the present case does not involve related claims.\n\nThe circuit court found that Ms. Kemp’s counsel made no effort to cull time from his billing\n\nrecords. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434 (the prevailing party’s counsel should make a good-faith\n\neffort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive redundant or otherwise\n\nunnecessary). Moreover, contrary to her own argument, United States Football League supports\n\nthe use of reducing the size of the award by a percentage amount to achieve a reasonable amount\n\nof attorney fees.\n\n\n¶ 46   Next, Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred when it failed to consider the\n\namount of attorney fees incurred by TMCC in determining the reasonableness of the fees. The\n\nfederal courts disagree over the relevance of opposing counsel’s billing records in the\n\ndetermination of a reasonable attorney fee award. Some courts have found them relevant and\n\nprobative, while other have found them either irrelevant or of little relevance. See Marks\n\nConstruction Co. v. Huntington National Bank, No. 1-05 CV 73 (N.D. W.V. 2010) (collecting\n                                                17 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ncases); see also Diecher v.

City of Evanston, No. 91 C 3291 (N.D.\n\nIll. 1995) (relevant, but both parties were seeking attorney fees).\n\n\n¶ 47   The amount of attorney fees spent by a defendant may be relevant in a fee-shifting case.\n\nNonetheless, it was of little relevancy here. According to Ms. Kemp, the circuit court\n\nacknowledged that TMCC probably spent over $1 million but ignored that factor in determining\n\nwhether her attorney fees of in excess of $1 million was reasonable. However, the attorney fee\n\naward was limited to the attorney fees incurred in Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim. Therefore,\n\nthe fact that TMCC spent $1 million in defending against the plaintiffs’ lawsuit was not relevant\n\nto what a reasonable amount of attorney fees in litigating Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim.\n\n\n¶ 48   Ms. Kemp complains that the circuit court ignored the difficulty in litigating consumer\n\ncases and reduced her attorney fees because it considered the issue in her case as having a lower\n\ndifficulty and novelty factor and required less skill. In its opinion and order, the circuit court\n\nnoted that compared to other cases involving police use of excessive force, involuntarily\n\ncommitted patients, Ms. Kemp’s case which involved the wrong amount of sales tax, was “much\n\nmore mundane.” However, the court agreed it was not its place to draw a distinction between\n\ncivil rights and consumer rights. In the end, what matters was that the attorney fee be reasonable.\n                                                  18 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nThe circuit court’s award of attorney fees was reasonable in light of Ms. Kemp’s one successful\n\nclaim.\n\n\n¶ 49     Finally, Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court disregarded the admonishment in\n\nPerdue and erroneously applied a Johnson factor, i.e., the attorney’s ability and reputation, in\n\ndetermining the reasonableness of the fee amount. She points to the circuit court’s references to\n\nother cases in which her attorney’s performance on behalf of other clients was criticized and that\n\nthe court ignored the seven uncontested affidavits in determining a reasonable fee.\n\n\n¶ 50     In Perdue, the Supreme Court stated that “the quality of an attorney’s performance\n\ngenerally should not be used to adjust the lodestar ‘[b]ecause considerations concerning the\n\nquality of a prevailing party’s counsel’s representation normally are reflected in the reasonable\n\nhourly rate.’ ” Perdue, 559 U.S. at 553 (quoting Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizen’s\n\nCouncil for Clean Air, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566 (1986)). The circuit court correctly noted in its\n\nmemorandum and order that the Johnson factor of an attorney’s ability and reputation is\n\nconsidered in the lodestar calculation. In any event, notwithstanding the negative references, the\n\ncircuit court granted Ms. Kemp’s request that her attorney’s hourly rate be set at $395.\n\n\n¶ 51     It is clear from the circuit court’s memorandum opinion that it used the lodestar in\n\ncalculating a reasonable attorney fee award in this case. The court’s reference to the factors in\n\nJohnson were clearly in line with the limited use of those factors as expressed by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Perdue. Accordingly, no error of law occurred in the circuit court’s application of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\nlodestar, and we find no abuse of discretion in the court’s determination of the amount of\n\nreasonable attorney fees due Ms. Kemp in this case.\n\n\n¶ 52            B. Costs, Fee Petition Proceedings, and Arbitrary Fee Reduction\n\n\n                                              (Issue I)\n\n\n¶ 53                                           1. Costs\n\n\n¶ 54   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred by refusing to reimburse her for such costs\n\nas photocopying, mailing, and binding of materials. She maintains that federal law requires that\n\nshe be reimbursed for these costs. See 15 U.S.C. § 1640(a)(3) (2010) (a creditor is liable for “in\n\nthe case of any successful action to enforce liability *** the costs of the action, together with a\n\nreasonable attorney’s fee as determined by the court”). In reviewing an award of costs, the court\n\ndetermines, first, whether the costs are recoverable, and second whether the costs are reasonable,\n\nboth in amount and necessity. Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1282.\n\n\n¶ 55   Ms. Kemp relies on several cases which she argues establish that the costs disallowed by\n\nthe circuit court were in fact recoverable in this case. In Abrams v. Lightolier, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692284\"><a href=\"/opinion/692284/bernard-abrams-v-lightolier-inc-coastal-fast-freight-inc-the-genlyte/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(3d Cir. 1995), the district court limited the amount of costs to be reimbursed finding that\n\nplaintiff had been adequately compensated by the generous attorney fee awards. Abrams, 50\n\nF.3d at 1222-23. On review, the court of appeals reversed finding that the district court had\n\napplied the wrong standard. On remand, the district court was ordered to determine which\n\nexpenses were considered “overhead” and thus included in an award of attorney fees and which\n\nexpenses were considered the cost of litigation and recoverable as costs. Abrams, 50 F.3d at\n                                                 20 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n1224-26. Unlike the district court in Abrams, in the present case, the circuit court refused to\n\nreimburse Ms. Kemp for items which it found were part of the overhead and included in the\n\nattorney’s hourly rate.\n\n\n¶ 56   In Miller v. Alamo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597870\"><a href=\"/opinion/597870/robert-a-miller-kody-miller-by-robert-a-miller-robert-miller-by-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1993), the court construed a different federal\n\ncosts statute. The court of appeals found that costs such as traveling, mailing and photocopying\n\nwere recoverable under 26 U.S.C § 7340 (20__), which allowed as costs out-of-pocket expenses\n\nwhich for lawyers normally billed their clients separately. Miller, 983 F.2d. at 862.\n\n\n¶ 57   In Burda v. M. Ecker Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628284\"><a href=\"/opinion/628284/matthew-burda-v-m-ecker-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">769</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1993), the court of appeals held that the\n\n$505.74 in costs for photocopying, postage, telephone and delivery charges, and computerized\n\nlegal research were fully documented and properly recoverable by a prevailing party under\n\nsection 28 U.S.C § 1920. The court found no basis for disturbing the district court’s award of\n\ncosts. Burda, 2 F.3d at 778.\n\n\n¶ 58   Even when costs are statutorily recoverable, the reviewing court applies the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard to whether the costs were reasonable and necessary. Cengr v. Flusibond\n\nPiping Systems, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751368\"><a href=\"/opinion/751368/robert-cengr-v-fusibond-piping-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454 (7th Cir. 1998). In light of this highly deferential\n\nstandard, we must credit the circuit court with a familiarity with this case that eclipses our own.\n\nThe circuit court was in the best place to determine the reasonableness and necessity for the\n\nexpenses for which Ms. Kemp sought reimbursement. This is not a case where the court applied\n\nthe wrong standard or failed to explain for the benefit of the reviewing court the denial of an\n\naward of costs. Instead, the circuit court set forth its reasoning in detail for declining to award\n\n\n                                                  21 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ncertain costs to Ms. Kemp. Just as the court in Burda upheld the district court’s ruling awarding\n\ncosts, we find no basis for disturbing the circuit court’s refusal to reimburse Ms. Kemp for the\n\nadditional costs she sought.\n\n\n¶ 59                           2. Denial of Fees for Fee Petition Proceeding\n\n\n¶ 60   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred when it denied her attorney fees for the\n\nfee petition proceeding. Ms. Kemp devotes one paragraph to her contention and limits her\n\nargument to stating that “[t]he lower court denied compensation for the fee petition proceeding,”\n\nand suggesting that this court “might decide to remand.” She relies on three federal cases which\n\nstand for the general proposition that the time spent on establishing the right and amount of the\n\nfee is compensable but are otherwise distinguishable from the case before us. See Camacho v.\n\nBridgeport Financial, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1443982\"><a href=\"/opinion/1443982/camacho-v-bridgeport-financial-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 981 (9th Cir. 2008) (remand for a redetermination of\n\nthe fees on fees employing the proper standard where the district court used the lodestar and a\n\nflat amount; Bond v.

In the present case, the\n\ntrial court did not deny Ms. Kemp an award for the time spent establishing the right to an\n\nattorney fee award because it believed that time spent to procure an attorney fees award was not\n\n\n                                                22 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\ncompensatory, or because TMCC had a “good-faith” argument to oppose an award of attorney\n\nfees, or because the trial court’s methodology in determining a fee on fee award was\n\ninconsistent.\n\n\n¶ 62   Moreover, those cases address the specific denial for compensation for time spent in\n\nestablishing the right to an award of fees. The trial court awarded Ms. Kemp attorney fees and\n\ncosts for her successful individual CLA claim. The court denied any fees or costs incurred after\n\nJune 10, 2011, in light of the unsuccessful appeal in Robinson III. In Bond, the court recognized\n\nthat the award of attorney fees would be subject to potential dilution unless the efforts of\n\nsuccessful plaintiffs to obtain fees are includable in a fee award. Bond, 630 F.2d at 1236. Since\n\nnone of the fees and costs incurred after June 10, 2011, were awarded on the basis of the lack of\n\nsuccess, Ms. Kemp fails to persuade us that she is entitled to compensation for preparing a fee\n\npetition for work for which the trial court denied compensation.\n\n\n¶ 63                           3. Arbitrary Denial of Attorney Fees\n\n\n¶ 64   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred when it cut 97% of the attorney fees she\n\nrequested without referring to specific time entries. She cites several cases for the proposition\n\nthat a court must not cut attorney fees by applying an arbitrary percentage. In Heiar v. Crawford\n\nCounty, Wisconsin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443255\"><a href=\"/opinion/443255/35-fair-emplpraccas-1458-36-fair-emplpraccas-112-35-empl-prac/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1984), the district court determined that the attorney\n\nfee amount sought was excessive and cut the fees by 50%. The court of appeals held that such a\n\nmethod might be appropriate where the fee amount was small. However, where the amount\n\nrequested was in excess of $50,000,\n\n\n                                                 23 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n        “the judge must do more than eyeball the request and if it seems excessive cut it down\n\n        by an arbitrary percentage. He has to make a judgment — considering the nature of the\n\n        case and the details of the request, taking evidence if need be, and defending his\n\n        judgment in a reasoned (though brief) opinion – on what the case should have cost the\n\n        party who submitted the request.” Heiar, 746 F.2d at 1204.\n\n\n¶ 65    Nonetheless, where a party has achieved only limited success, the court may attempt to\n\nidentify specific hours that should be eliminated or it may simply reduce the award to account for\n\nthe limited success. Hensley, 461 U.S. 436-37. While the circuit court did not specify each entry\n\nit determined was excessive, the court detailed its reasoning for eliminating work which was\n\nunrelated to Ms. Kemp’s individual CLA claim or was otherwise not compensable. See Hensley,\n\n461 U.S. at 437 (when adjusting the amount of attorney fees on the basis of the limited nature of\n\nthe relief, the court should make clear that it considered the relationship between the amount of\n\nthe fees awarded and the results obtained). That the circuit court did so in this case is amply\n\ndemonstrated by its memorandum opinion and order.\n\n\n¶ 66    In sum, we find no error or abuse of discretion in the circuit court’s award of costs, its\n\ndenial of fees for the fee petition proceedings, and we find that the circuit court did not act\n\narbitrarily in its reduction of the attorney fees in this case.\n\n\n¶ 67                             D. Denial of Fees for Appellate Work\n\n\n                                               (Issue IV)\n\n\n\n                                                   24 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n¶ 68   Ms. Kemp contends that the circuit court erred in denying her attorney fees for any of the\n\nappellate work this case. Ms. Kemp argues that the circuit court’s denial of the fees was based on\n\nthe lack of success instead of whether it was reasonable for her to pursue an appeal. People Who\n\nCare v. Rockford Board of Education, School District No. 205, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722581\"><a href=\"/opinion/722581/people-who-care-an-unincorporated-association-larry-hoarde-chasty/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1314 (7th Cir.\n\n1996) (the court’s focus should be on the reasonableness of the attorney’s actions rather than the\n\nsuccess or failure of the actions).\n\n\n¶ 69   We need not determine the reasonableness of the plaintiffs’ decision to appeal from the\n\ncircuit court’s June 10, 2011, order. In Robinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889, this court’s\n\nremand was limited to a determination of an award of attorney fees and costs on Ms. Kemp’s\n\nindividual CLA claim. Robinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889 ¶ 84. Ms. Kemp’s assertion that\n\nas a result of the appeal in Robinson III, she won her individual claim and an award of attorney\n\nfees and costs on that claim is belied by the record. Her individual claim was not at issue, and it\n\nwas necessary to remand for an award of fees because the fee award we vacated included fees for\n\nthe joint claims that had been reversed. Robinson III, 2012 IL App (1st) 111889 ¶ 84.\n\n\n¶ 70   As to the first appeal in this case (Robinson I), Ms. Kemp argues that the circuit court\n\nerred in refusing to compensate her for the time her attorney spent to protect her claim between\n\n1995 and 2008. In Cabrales v. County of Los Angeles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562702\"><a href=\"/opinion/562702/josefina-cabrales-v-county-of-los-angeles-ronald-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1991), the court\n\nof appeals held that plaintiffs should be compensated for attorney fees incurred for services that\n\ncontribute to the ultimate victory in the lawsuit. Cabrales, 935 F.2d at 1052. “[E]ven if a specific\n\nclaim failed, the time spent on that claim may be compensable, in full or in part, if it contributes\n\nto the success of the other claims.” Cabrales, 935 F.2d at 1052 (citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435).\n                                                 25 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n¶ 71   Contrary to Ms. Kemp’s argument, the circuit court found that time spent in 1998\n\ndefending against the dismissal of her individual claim in the circuit court and the appeal\n\n(Robinson I) where the dismissal of her individual claim was reversed was compensable. The\n\ncourt found that the time spent on the appeal to the supreme court was not compensable. We\n\nagree since only the joint claims were at issue in that appeal. See Robinson II, 201 Ill. 2d at 405\n\n(the issues before the court were whether the joint claims were barred by res judicata and\n\nwhether the plaintiffs had stated a cause of action under the Consumer Fraud Act); see also\n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 434-35 (prevailing party was not entitled to compensation for attorney fees\n\nexpended on ultimately unsuccessful claims).\n\n\n¶ 72    Ms. Kemp argues that she is entitled to attorney fees for the appeal to supreme court\n\nbecause the plaintiffs achieved a benefit for Illinois consumers in that the supreme court reduced\n\nthe number of factors consumers must prove in order to succeed on an unfair practices claim\n\nunder the Consumer Fraud Act. See Robinson II, 201 Ill. 2d at 418. However, the CFA claims\n\nwere joint, and the supreme court’s ruling did not benefit Ms. Kemp’s individual claim.\n\n\n¶ 73   The circuit court considered that Ms. Kemp’s individual claim was an extremely minor\n\none compared with issues on the plaintiffs’ joint claims raised in Robinson I, and awarded 25\n\nhours, or 10% of the total hours claimed. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37 (trial court has the\n\ndiscretion to eliminate specific hours or simply reduce the award to account for the limited\n\nsuccess).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26 \n\n\fNo. 1-15-2114\n\n¶ 74   In sum, we find no abuse of discretion by the circuit court in its determination of the\n\ncompensable time with regard to the appellate proceedings in this case.\n\n\n¶ 75                                  CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n¶ 76   For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n¶ 77   Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                27 \n\n\f</pre>",
