Stanger (Argued)\n       Campbell, Durrant & Beatty\n       555 Grant Street, Suite 120\n       Pittsburgh, PA 15219\n\n       Attorneys for Appellees\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nPOLLAK, District Judge.\n\nIn this case, plaintiff-appellant Delores Armour claims\nthat her First Amendment rights were violated when she\nwas fired from her position as secretary to defendant-\nappellee Bea Schulte, then a County Commissioner of\ndefendant-appellee Beaver County, Pennsylvania (\"the\nCounty\"). Armour contends that she was terminated\nbecause of her political beliefs, and hence that her\ntermination contravened the general rule against political\npatronage dismissals established in Elrod v. Burns, 427\nU.S. 347 (1976) and Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980).\nThe District Court granted summary judgment in favor of\nthe County and Schulte, on the ground that the County\nand Schulte had satisfied the burden of establishing that\npolitical affiliation was an appropriate requirement for the\nsecretarial position. Additionally, the District Court found,\nsua sponte, that appellant had failed to adduce sufficient\nevidence to enable a fact-finder to infer that her termination\nwas politically motivated--i.e., to infer that, as Armour\ncontended, Schulte decided to terminate her based on the\nperception that Armour was supporting a candidate other\nthan the one backed by Schulte in a campaign for a local\njudgeship.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we reverse.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural Overview\n\nArmour and Schulte met when Armour volunteered to\nwork on Schulte's 1995 campaign as a Democratic\ncandidate for the office of County Commissioner. Armour\nwas one of a number of people working on Schulte's\ncampaign. As part of her involvement in the campaign,\n\n                                 2\n\fArmour attended campaign committee meetings, traveled\nwith Schulte to polling locations and political functions,\nattended fund-raising events, and placed Schulte's signs\nthroughout the voting district. After winning the election,\nSchulte offered to hire Armour as her secretary. Armour\naccepted and began her employment as Schulte's secretary\nin January 1996. According to Armour's deposition\ntestimony, once hired, she relinquished her political role\nand turned her attention to the clerical tasks of the job, at\nleast during work hours. Armour testified that she spent\napproximately half of her time working for Schulte and\nthat, in the balance of her time, Armour--like the other\ncommissioners' secretaries--performed clerical tasks under\nthe supervision of the Chief Clerk of the County. Armour\ntestified that in January, 1999, Joseph Askar, a Democrat\nseeking election to a local judgeship, approached her with\nlogistical questions about running a campaign; she\nanswered Askar's questions but took no other action on his\nbehalf. The parties agree that in early February Schulte\nlearned of Armour's contact with Askar--who was running\nagainst the Democratic candidate supported by Schulte and\nthe local party establishment--and questioned Armour\nabout her involvement with Askar's campaign.\n\nAt about the same time, Armour proposed that the\nCounty create a human service coordinator position and\nhire her for the position. Schulte testified that she raised\nthe possibility with the other commissioners and that they\ndecided against creating the position. Instead, in late\nFebruary, 1999, Schulte offered Armour a part-time clerical\nposition at a geriatric center earning a lower salary and\nasked Armour to go home and think about the offer. 1 The\nnext day Armour took a personal day off. The testimony of\nSchulte and Armour indicates that, on February 26, when\nArmour was next in the office, Schulte asked Armour\nwhether she had made a decision about taking the geriatric\ncenter position. Schulte testified that \"[Armour] told me\nthat I would have to speak to her attorney.\" Armour\ntestified that she told Schulte that \"if [Schulte] had some\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Schulte testified that she did not know at the time that the position\nwas part-time; however, Armour testified that she, Armour, was aware\nthat the position was part-time when it was offered.\n\n                               3\n\fwork for me to do I'd be more than happy to go back to her\noffice, but if it was about the job offer, I was requesting she\nwait until my attorney was present to discuss it.\" App. at\n77 (Armour Dep. at 101). The parties are in agreement that\nSchulte then advised Armour that she was terminated.\n\nArmour filed suit under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 in the United\nStates District Court for the Western District of\nPennsylvania against the County and also against Schulte\nin her individual capacity. The County and Schulte moved\nfor summary judgment on the ground that political\naffiliation was an appropriate job requirement for the\nposition of secretary to a Beaver County Commissioner. In\ntheir summary judgment motion, appellees acknowledged\nthat the question whether Armour was fired based on her\npolitical affiliation \"involve[s] disputes over issues of\nmaterial fact best left for trial.\" The District Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Schulte and the County\nbased both on the appropriateness of a political-affiliation\njob requirement and on the lack of evidence that Armour's\npolitical affiliation was the cause of her termination.\n\nII Standard of Review\n\nWe exercise plenary review of the District Court's decision\nto grant summary judgment. See Assaf v. Fields , 178 F.3d\n170, 171 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 951 (1999). In\ndoing so, we must apply the same test that the district\ncourt must apply. See Chipollini v. Spencer Gifts, Inc., 814\nF.2d 893, 896 (3d Cir.)(en banc), cert. denied , 483 U.S.\n1052 (1987). Reviewing the record as a whole, we will \"draw\nall reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party\"\nand will not weigh the evidence or make credibility\ndeterminations. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products,\nInc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000). If it appears that \"there is\nno genuine issue as to any material fact\" and the movant\nis entitled to judgment at a matter of law, we will affirm a\ngrant of summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Of\ncourse, we will give credence to \" `evidence supporting the\nmoving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at\nleast to the extent that evidence comes from disinterested\nwitnesses.' \" Reeves, 530 U.S. at 151 (quoting Anderson v.\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 300 (1986)).\n\n                               4\n\fIn lawsuits such as the present one, in which the plaintiff\nis a government employee raising a First Amendment\npolitical discharge claim, the usual standard of review for\ngrants of summary judgment is modified in that it is up to\nthe defendant government employer to prove that political\naffiliation is an appropriate requirement for the job. \"Since\n. . . it is the government's burden to demonstrate an\noverriding interest in order to validate an encroachment on\nprotected interests, the burden of establishing this\njustification\" rests with the government employer. Elrod,\n427 U.S. at 368. Moreover, in Zold v. Township of Mantua,\n935 F.2d 633 (3d Cir. 1991), we invoked the principle that,\nwhen the First Amendment is implicated, appellate courts\nhave a special responsibility to undertake an exacting\nreview of the whole record with a particularly close focus on\nfacts that are determinative of a constitutional right. Id. at\n636 (citing New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254,\n285 (1964) and New Jersey Citizen Action v. Edison\nTownship, 797 F.2d 1250, 1259 (3d Cir. 1986)).\n\nIII Review of the Record\n\nBefore undertaking an analysis of the legal issues\npresented on this appeal, we will set forth (1) the principal\nrecord evidence regarding the nature of Armour's secretarial\nposition, (2) the principal record evidence regarding the\nreason or reasons for Armour's termination, and (3) the\nDistrict Court's rationale for granting summary judgment in\nfavor of appellees.\n\nA. The Nature of the Secretarial Position\n\nNone of the parties contends that Armour was a policy-\nmaker in her position as secretary to Schulte. But the\nparties disagree as to the level of confidentiality,\nloyalty, and political trust required in the position. There\nare three Beaver County Commissioners. At the time in\nquestion, there were two Democrats--Commissioner\nSchulte and Commissioner Dan Donatella--and one\nRepublican--Commissioner Nancy Loxley. Joann Clarke\nwas Donatella's secretary and Jo Johnson was Loxley's\nsecretary.2 According to the testimony of Donatella,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Clarke and Johnson were both hired by previous commissioners and\nthen retained by Donatella and Loxley, respectively.\n\n                               5\n\falthough as a formal matter all three commissioners had\njoint authority over personnel decisions regarding the\ncommissioners' secretaries, it was understood among the\ncommissioners that each commissioner had the power to\nhire and fire his or her own secretary.\n\nThe three secretaries shared the same office space and,\ndepending on availability, they would perform routine tasks\nfor any one of the commissioners. Armour testified that she\ndevoted fifty to sixty percent of her time to performing work\nfor the Chief Clerk. Clarke testified that tasks assigned to\nher by the Chief Clerk filled approximately sixty percent of\nher working hours. In working for the Chief Clerk and in\nworking for the commissioners, the secretaries spent the\nbulk of their time performing such clerical tasks as typing\ncorrespondence, resolutions and motions; answering\nphones; greeting and directing visitors to the office;\nhandling paperwork; opening mail; making photocopies;\nmaking travel arrangements; scheduling meetings; filing\ndocuments; directing checks to the proper departments;\nand obtaining signatures. Armour also scheduled the board\nmeetings which required the presence of the entire board,\nmade photocopies of all mail received that was relevant to\nthe entire board, and took minutes at public board\nmeetings when Johnson was not available to do so.\nAdditionally, she attended monthly meetings of the\nAliquippa Family Preservation Network (\"AFPN\") in\nSchulte's stead. At these meetings she took notes and voted\nas Schulte's proxy. In testimony, Armour described her role\nat those meetings as follows:\n\n       [I]t was not a real important board, they didn't really\n       deal with a lot of issues other than trying to get\n       themselves established and there were things that\n       would have to be voted on, like paying the bills, this\n       person going to conference or whatever. I didn't sit in\n       on the executive board and have privy to the decision\n       making, but the regular minutes, if it called for a vote,\n       yes.\n\nApp. at 69 (Armour Dep. at 48). As to Armour's\nparticipation in the AFPN meetings, Schulte testified: \"[A]t\nthe time I didn't realize that she had the power to vote, but\nI found out later that she was, indeed, voting in my stead.\"\n\n                               6\n\fApp. at 54 (Schulte Dep. at 21). Armour maintained in her\ndeposition testimony that, although she did not end her\nown political involvement, she stopped accompanying\nSchulte to political functions at the close of the 1995\ncampaign. Also, Armour testified that none of the\nsecretaries was privy to personnel matters or files; the\ntestimony of Clarke and Johnson is not to the contrary.3\n\nIn 1996, Armour suggested that a position of office\nmanager for the commissioners be created and that she be\nappointed to the position. Schulte testified that she\nproposed this to the other commissioners but that they\nwere not in favor of the idea. App. at 56 (Schulte Dep. at\n31)(\"I'm sure they did not want to have their secretaries\nsubject to my secretary.\"). In 1997, the commissioners\ndecided to create an executive administrative position\ndirectly under the commissioners and on par with the Chief\nClerk. In her testimony, Schulte emphasized that the\nperson in the executive administrative position, as that\nposition was envisioned, would have performed \"strictly\nexecutive administrative-type duties and . . . represent the\ncommissioners.\" The position was created and funded but\nnever filled because, according to Schulte's testimony, the\ncommissioners could not decide on who should be hired.\nMoreover, it seems that Armour was not seriously\nconsidered for this position because the commissioners had\ndecided that a college degree--which Armour did not\nhave--was a requirement for the job. Schulte testified:\n\n       Delores' husband called me and wanted to know why\n       we had included a requirement for a college degree for\n       that position, because that eliminated Delores from\n       consideration. . . . I told him that I included--had\n       included that requirement, because this person would,\n       indeed, be representing the three commissioners, and\n       we felt that was a necessary--all the commissioners\n       had agreed that would be a necessary requirement.\n\nApp. at 56 (Schulte Dep. at 32).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. However, when enumerating his secretary's duties in deposition\ntestimony, Donatella mentioned that his secretary had some involvement\nin payroll.\n\n                               7\n\fOn March 11, 1998, Armour completed a document\nentitled \"Class Specification Review & Comment\".\nDirections for completing the form stated, in pertinent part:\n\n       Please review the attached classification specification\n       to make sure it accurately describes the body of work\n       you perform. Please note that in many cases, it will not\n       identify every task that you specifically perform. When\n       you see the words: May perform other duties, including\n       work in other functional areas this means that within\n       the list of duties you should find the essential duties\n       that you regularly perform.\n\n       If you believe some essential duties have been\n       omitted, or a part of the specification is inaccurate;\n       please indicate this below.\n\nApp. at 93 (emphasis in original).\n\nAppellant typed the following response on the space\nprovided:\n\n       Although this job may appear secretarial in nature, a\n       large portion of the duties fall more towards\n       administrative assistant. The high level of\n       confidentiality and responsibility reaches far beyond\n       the desk, often into our personal lives. A broad\n       background in County government is essential for even\n       the entry level of this position.\n\nId.\n\nThe form was signed by Armour and initialed by Schulte.\nIn deposition testimony, Armour explained this statement\nby saying: \"[T]he concept I was trying to get across was\nwhat I thought the job should be more so than what the job\nactually is.\" Asked whether she viewed her position as a\nconfidential position, Armour testified: \"I viewed it as a\nsecretary. Of course all secretaries have some confidence to\ntheir boss, regardless of their position.\" App. at 69 (Armour\nDep. at 49). Asked if she would describe the position as\nrequiring a high degree of confidentiality, Armour\nresponded, \"I would say normal.\" Id.\n\nArmour's description of the position in her deposition\ntestimony stands in some tension with the statements of\n\n                               8\n\fother witnesses. Schulte testified that Armour was privy to\nconfidential material through her access to lists of\nresolutions and motions from commissioners' meetings,\ncorrespondence among commissioners, Schulte's telephone\ncalls, and her personal calendar. Schulte also testified that\nArmour \"would often talk to department heads setting up\nmeetings and explaining the purpose of the meeting. That\nwas a very important part of her function. If she didn't\nunderstand the purpose of the meeting, then she couldn't\nexplain it, and often the meetings were involving\nconfidential matters.\" App. at 54 (Schulte Dep. at 21-22).\n\nWhen asked to describe the secretarial position,\nDonatella testified as follows:\n\n       The secretary obviously in that capacity works very\n       close with the county commissioner whom she's\n       affiliated with because of the fact that you need a good\n       close relationship. As a matter of fact, I do believe that\n       they were classified as confidential secretaries and not\n       come under the realm of the union, because each\n       commissioner was at liberty to select that particular\n       employee because of the relationship that they needed\n       to maintain.\n\nApp. at 44 (Donatella Dep. at 6).\n\nDonatella also testified, with respect to the duties that\nhis secretary performed:\n\n       She does everything from answering the telephone for\n       me to doing confidential letters, even sometimes\n       arranging meetings. Doing not only my clerical work,\n       but frankly, operating as my eyes and ears, both\n       political and otherwise. She helps me even on the\n       political end of it, arranging for different political\n       functions and so forth.\n\nId. (Donatella Dep. at 6-7). There may, however, be room for\nmore than one interpretation of Donatella's testimony\nregarding the nature of the secretarial position. For\nexample, Donatella testified:\n\n       [B]asically, they do everything that any other\n       confidential secretary would do as far as even running\n       the office side is concerned. They do resolutions, they\n\n                               9\n\f       get signatures, payroll, act as receptionist, they do\n       typing and all the other secretarial skills that's\n       required.\n\nId.\n\nAsked to explain what he meant when he said the\nsecretaries \"do resolutions,\" Donatella clarified his\ntestimony by stating that the resolutions are prepared by\nthe law department and the secretaries' responsibilities are\nlimited to (a) ensuring that the commissioners sign the\ncompleted resolutions and (b) mailing the resolutions to the\nproper places.\n\nWhen Donatella was asked whether political affiliation\nwas required for a commissioner's secretary, he testified:\n\n       Well, I don't know if it's a requirement, no; but mainly,\n       it is associated with that because on the campaign\n       trail, usually those people are directly or indirectly\n       involved in the campaign, helping that individual to be\n       elected. But I have seen where sometimes someone is\n       selected that is not involved in the campaign. . . . It's\n       whomever that commissioner feels comfortable with I\n       think is the bottom line. They have to be capable of\n       doing the job at hand, and it always helps to be\n       politically astute, obviously.\n\nId. at 45 (Donatella Dep. at 9). Amplifying the connection\nbetween politics and the secretarial position, Donatella\nexplained:\n\n       [G]enerally, if a Republican is a commissioner, they are\n       going to hire a Republican secretary and the other way\n       around. I don't know of any case where it was other\n       than that. I do [not] remember a Democrat hiring a\n       Republican or vice versa, at least to my knowledge in\n       the 35 years I was there. They are generally the same\n       party, if that's the question.\n\nId. (Donatella Dep. at 10).\n\nThe testimony of Johnson, secretary to Commissioner\nLoxley, reinforces appellees' argument that Armour's\nposition required a significant level of confidentiality: \"The\nwork that I do for Nancy [Loxley] I would consider to be of\n\n                                10\n\fa confidential nature, not so much the general work that I\ndo for [the Chief Clerk] . . .\" App. at 85 (Johnson Dep. at\n36). With respect to her work for Loxley, Johnson testified:\n\"[I]t's a political atmosphere here, and Nancy would often\ntimes talk to me in confidence about political issues, party\nissues that I would have to keep to myself and not be able\nto share with anybody else.\" Id. However, portions of\nJohnson's testimony indicate some question as to the\nsubstance behind her more general assertions regarding\nthe nature of the job. Asked whether there were any other\nsources of confidential information beyond the above\nreferenced conversations with Loxley, such as letters or\nphone calls, Johnson testified: \"No. Her correspondence\nthat she got in typically, unless it was something political\nin nature, if it was county related, all three commissioners\nwould get the same correspondence.\" Id. Additionally,\nJohnson testified that she had not been questioned about\nher political affiliation during her interview for the position,\nthat she did not consider herself a political adviser, and\nthat her political affiliation did not play any role in her\nability to keep information confidential. Johnson also\nprovided an affidavit in which she stated that Armour used\nto identify herself as Schulte's \"confidential secretary\" when\nshe answered the phone. However, Armour denied having\nso identified herself.\n\nClarke, Donatella's secretary, testified that \"my\nresponsibility, of course, is to represent [Donatella] and to\nkeep all confidentiality\". App. at 89 (Clarke Dep. at 9).\nClarke's testimony brings into focus the seeming ambiguity\nof the term \"represent\" as used by the parties and\nwitnesses. Asked about her participation in active\ncampaigning, Clarke testified that she served as Donatella's\ncampaign treasurer (usually performing these tasks during\nevening and weekend hours) and would assist Donatella\nwith his campaign at his request: \"I represent\nCommissioner Donatella mainly when I am anywhere\npolitically. I'm there basically to assist him, if that's--you\nknow, if I am to represent him at a function or if I am to be\nthere just to be, you know, part of the event.\" App. at 91\n(Clarke Dep. at 34).

The Reason for Armour's Termination\n\nWe now turn to the evidence in the record regarding the\nreason for Armour's termination.\n\nArmour contends that rumors of her involvement with\nJoseph Askar's campaign for District Justice in Centre\nTownship motivated Schulte to fire her. It is undisputed\nthat Schulte was aware of such rumors. According to\nArmour's testimony, in January 1999, while Armour was\nstill employed as Schulte's secretary, Askar, a Democrat,\napproached Armour with questions about the mechanics of\nconducting his campaign. Armour contends, and appellees\ndo not dispute, that she merely answered Askar's questions\non topics such as how many signs were required to cover\na certain voting district. It appears to be undisputed that\nSchulte was told in early February, 1999 that Armour\nintended to support Askar instead of Joseph Zupsic, the\nDemocratic candidate supported by Schulte. Donatella\n\n                               12\n\ftestified that he and Schulte were present at a rally when\nsomeone told Donatella \"that I'd better find Bea Schulte\nbecause Joe Schaffer, the town chair, was extremely upset\nbecause allegedly Dee [Armour] was working for Joe Askar.\"\nApp. at 47 (Donatella Dep. at 20). Donatella testified\nfurther:\n\n       So I went and found Bea and I said, \"Bea, there's a\n       problem, I think you better go talk to Mr. Schaffer\n       because he is saying that your employee is working for\n       Joe Askar.\" So I escorted her over to Mr. Schaffer and\n       Mr. Zupsic, who was the other candidate, and they\n       confronted her with and accused her that Dee\n       [Armour], her employee, was working for Mr. Zupsic's\n       opposition. Bea's comment in my presence was that\n       she would find out about what was going on, she was\n       not aware of that but she would talk to Dee.\n\nId. It is undisputed that on one occasion early in February\nof 1999, Schulte did question Armour about her\ninvolvement in Askar's campaign. Armour testified that\nSchulte called her into Schulte's office and said:\"I'm getting\nflak over you supporting Joe Askar.\" App. at 70 (Armour\nDep. at 53). According to Armour, Schulte asked a number\nof questions about Armour's involvement with Askar's\ncampaign. For example, Armour testified that Schulte\nasked her whether she was holding \"coffee klatches\"--small\ngrass-roots meetings to introduce a candidate to voters--for\nAskar, and that in reply she had explained that she was\nnot involved in Askar's campaign but had answered some\nsimple questions. Later that day, Armour approached\nSchulte and told her that she was upset about being\nquestioned about what she did in her personal time. Some\ntwo to three weeks later, on February 26, 1999, Schulte\ndischarged Armour.\n\nDespite his acknowledgment that there was concern\nregarding Armour's possible involvement with Askar's\ncampaign, Donatella testified that he was not under the\nimpression that Armour's termination was related to her\nperceived support of Askar, nor had he heard rumors that\nArmour lost her job for that reason. Rather, Donatella\ntestified that he attributed Armour's termination to a\ndeterioration of the relationship between Armour and\n\n                                13\n\fSchulte that, according to Donatella, had begun\napproximately six months prior to Armour's termination.\n\nC. The District Court's Opinion\n\nWith the foregoing synopsis of the record in view, we turn\nto the District Court's ruling granting summary judgment\nin favor of Schulte and the County. The District Court\nmade the following assessment of Armour's testimony about\nthe nature of her position:\n\n       Plaintiff completed [the March 11, 1998] job description\n       [in which she described the position as entailing a\n       \"high level of confidentiality\"] before any alleged\n       problems between herself and Schulte. We thus\n       consider her deposition testimony [in which she\n       described the position as entailing a \"normal\" level of\n       confidentiality] as contradictory and her unbiased\n       statement regarding her job duties as provided in\n       March 1998 as more significant. See, e.g., Martin v.\n       Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 851 F.2d 703, 705-\n       06 (3d Cir. 1988)(permissible for district court to\n       disregard subsequent contradictory affidavit for\n       purposes of determining whether there was a material\n       dispute of fact).\n\nMem. Op. at 10.\n\nThe District Court proceeded to hold that appellees had\ncarried their burden of establishing that political affiliation\nwas properly required for the secretarial position:\n\n       We find that plaintiff's party affiliation was an\n       appropriate requirement for the effective performance of\n       the job. See [Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517, 521 (3d\n       Cir. 1981)]; [Brown v. Trench, 787 F.2d 167, 170 (3d\n       Cir. 1986)]; Waskovich v. Morgano, 2 F.3d 1292, 1303\n       (3d Cir. 1993); Roseman v. County of Cambria, 862\n       F.Supp. 19, 21 (W.D. Pa. 1993); see also Williams v.\n       City of River Rouge, 909 F.2d 151, 153 n.4 (6th Cir.\n       1990)(political affiliation is more than party politics, it\n       is about trust, confidence, and sharing a common\n       viewpoint with those to whom authority is delegated).\n       Plaintiff acted as liaison between department heads and\n       Schulte, which required knowledge of confidential\n\n                                  14\n\fmatters. She also had access to correspondence\ncontaining party issues and confidential material.\nCommissioner Donatella noted the importance of\nloyalty and the necessity of a close relationship between\nthe commissioner and secretary. Johnson described the\noffice as a political atmosphere, and Clarke\nacknowledged that she \"represents\" Commissioner\nDonatella at political events.\n\nPlaintiff testified that she responded to constituent\ncalls and handled the matter before involving Schulte.\nEach time plaintiff responded to a concern of a\nconstituent, she was representing Schulte in a political\nnature. See, e.g., Brown, 787 F.2d at 170 (while some\nof [plaintiff's] duties were only technical or clerical in\nnature, her principal duty was to act as spokesman for\nthe Commissioners). It is likely that Democratic\nconstituents who seek redress from their Democratic\ncommissioner, or simply express concerns of a political\nnature, expect that the commissioners' secretary shares\ntheir political ideology. In other words, Democratic\nconstituents should find comfort in expressing their\nconcerns to the commissioner's secretary, whom the\nvoters felt would express or relay the issues accurately\nand compassionately to the commissioner. In essence,\nplaintiff was a conduit between the Democratic\nconstituents and Commissioner Schulte, their elected\nrepresentative. See Waskovich, 2 F.3d at 1299-1300,\nquoting Hall v. Ford, 856 F.2d 255, 263 (D.C. Cir.\n1988)(\"high level officials must be permitted to\naccomplish their organizational objectives through key\ndeputies who are loyal, cooperative, willing to carry out\ntheir superior's policies, and perceived by the public as\nsharing their superiors' aims\").\n\nPlaintiff attended meetings on behalf of Schulte, voted\nin her stead, and attended political functions with the\nCommissioner. Her own job description elevated the\nposition to one of \"administrative assistant.\" Based on\nthe evidence of record, we find that an absence of\npolitical cohesion would undermine the working\nrelationship between plaintiff and Schulte. Cf. Burns v.\nCounty of Cambria, Pennsylvania, 971 F.2d 1015,\n\n                        15\n\f       1022-23 (3d Cir. 1992). We find that defendants have\n       established that political affiliation is an appropriate job\n       requirement for plaintiff's position.\n\nMem. Op. at 10-12.4\n\nAdditionally, the District Court held that Armour did not\nestablish the causation elements of the test set forth in\nRobertson v. Fiore, 62 F.3d 596, 599 (3d Cir. 1995)(plaintiff\nmust prove \"that the employee maintained an affiliation\nwith a party\" and \"that the employee's political affiliation\nwas a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse\nemployment decision\"). First, the District Court held that\nArmour's actual political affiliation with Askar was\ninsufficient to meet the Robertson test because that\nconnection \"was minor.\" Mem. Op. at 13. Second, the\nDistrict Court held that Armour's argument that her\n\" `perceived' political affiliation with Askar's campaign was a\nsubstantial or motivating factor in Schulte's decision to\nterminate her\" was \"without merit\" because Schulte\nquestioned Armour about her involvement with Askar's\ncampaign on only one occasion. Id. Finally, the District\nCourt credited testimony of Donatella and Schulte that\nindicated that Armour was fired because her relationship\nwith Schulte had deteriorated independently of any\ntensions that were caused by Armour's perceived\nconnection with Joseph Askar.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nFirst, we will consider whether, as the District Court\nheld, the record on appellees' motion for summary\njudgment mandated a finding that political affiliation was\nan appropriate requirement for Armour's job. Second, we\nwill consider whether, as the District Court held sua\nsponte, appellees were entitled to summary judgment on\nthe alternate ground that Armour had failed to present any\nsignificant evidence that her firing was attributable to\npolitical affiliation.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Armour testified that she did not accompany Schulte to political\nfunctions once she was hired as Schulte's secretary.\n\n                               16\n\fA. Armour's Job\n\nAt least at one time--namely, during Schulte's 1995\ncampaign--Delores Armour's relationship with Bea Schulte\ncould have been characterized as political in nature. It is\nless clear that Armour's position as secretary to Schulte\nrequired a shared political purpose. The question before\nthis court is whether defendants have established, beyond\nfactual dispute, that political agreement was an appropriate\nrequirement for the position of secretary to a Beaver County\nCommissioner.\n\nAdverse employment actions against government\nemployees that are based on political affiliation are, as a\ngeneral rule, prohibited. See O'Hare Truck Service, Inc. v.\nCity of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712 (1996); Rutan v. Republican\nParty of Illinois, 497 U.S. 62 (1990); Branti v. Finkel, 445\nU.S. 507 (1980); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976). In\nElrod, a plurality of the Court first announced this rule\nbased on the recognition that political patronage dismissals\nrun counter to the First Amendment rights of free speech\nand political association. See Elrod, 427 U.S. at 359. At the\nsame time, the Court delineated a narrowly drawn\nexception for particular positions for which political\naffiliation is found to be an appropriate requirement.\nApplying the intermediate \"exacting\" level of scrutiny, the\nCourt explained: \"The interest advanced must be\nparamount, one of vital importance, and the burden is on\nthe government to show the existence of such an interest.\"\nId. at 362; see Boyle v. County of Allegheny Pennsylvania,\n139 F.3d 386, 395 (3d Cir. 1998). The notion of what\nconstitutes a position for which political affiliation may\nacceptably be required has developed over time. In Elrod,\nthe Court adopted an approach that distinguished between\npolicymaking and non-policymaking positions. Reiterating\nthe rule in his concurrence, Justice Stewart advised that\npolitical affiliation could not provide a basis for adverse\nactions taken against a \"nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential\ngovernment employee\". Id. at 375 (Stewart, J., concurring).\nThe Court described the inquiry into the nature of the\nresponsibilities and the function of a given position as\nparticularly fact-specific. Id. at 367-68.\n\n                               17\n\fIn Branti, the Court revised the Elrod test to lessen the\nemphasis on determinations of whether a position entails\npolicymaking and confidentiality: \"the ultimate inquiry is\nnot whether the label `policymaker' or `confidential' fits a\nparticular position; rather, the question is whether the\nhiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an\nappropriate requirement for the effective performance of the\npublic office involved.\" Branti, 445 U.S. at 518. Justice\nStevens, speaking for the Court, stated: \"Under some\ncircumstances, a position may be appropriately considered\npolitical even though it is neither confidential nor\npolicymaking in character.\" Id. at 518 (providing an\nexample of a scenario in which \"a State's election laws\nrequire that precincts be supervised by two election judges\nof different parties\"). He continued: \"It is equally clear that\nparty affiliation is not necessarily relevant to every\npolicymaking or confidential position.\" Id. (giving the\nexample of a football coach for a state university).\n\n       On the other hand, it is equally clear that the Governor\n       of a State may appropriately believe that the official\n       duties of various assistants who help him write\n       speeches, explain his views to the press, or\n       communicate with the legislature cannot be performed\n       effectively unless those persons share his political\n       beliefs and party commitments.\n\nId. The Branti Court also reiterated that in order for a\npatronage dismissal to pass constitutional muster, it must\nforward a governmental purpose:\n\n       The plurality [in Elrod] emphasized that patronage\n       dismissals could be justified only if they advanced a\n       governmental, rather than a partisan, interest. 427\n       U.S., at 362. That standard clearly was not met to the\n       extent that employees were expected to perform\n       extracurricular activities for the party, or were being\n       rewarded for past services to the party. Government\n       funds, which are collected from taxpayers of all parties\n       on a nonpolitical basis, cannot be expended for the\n       benefit of one political party simply because that party\n       has control of the government.\n\nBranti, 445 U.S. at 517 n.12. The requirement of a\ngovernmental purpose to support political patronage\n\n                                18\n\freflects the core holding of Elrod and Branti that a long\ntradition of political patronage cannot, in itself, immunize\npolitically motivated dismissals from scrutiny.\n\nWe have had numerous occasions to apply these\nprinciples. In Boyle v. County of Allegheny Pennsylvania,\n139 F.3d 386 (3d Cir. 1998), we charted the development of\nThird Circuit case law interpreting the Elrod /Branti test.\nThe Boyle court canvassed Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517,\n521 (3d Cir. 1981)(adopting a \"functional analysis\" under\nwhich a dismissal was permissible where a difference in\nparty affiliation would \"be highly likely to cause an official\nto be ineffective in carrying out the duties and\nresponsibilities of the office\"), Brown v. Trench, 787 F.2d\n167, 168 (3d Cir. 1986)(refining the Elrod/ Branti test by\nfocusing the inquiry on \"whether the employee has\nmeaningful input into decision making concerning the\nnature and scope of a major [governmental]\nprogram\")(internal quotation marks omitted), and Zold, 935\nF.2d at 636 (synthesizing prior decisions and holding that\nappellate courts are obligated to \"make an independent\nexamination of the whole record\" with \"special scrutiny\").\n\nWe noted in Boyle, 139 F.3d at 396, that because the\nElrod/Branti test is flexible and entails an extremely fact-\nintensive inquiry, cases such as the case at bar resist easy\ngeneralizations. In the case at bar, we must determine\nwhether the District Court's grant of summary judgment\nwas correct as to the appellant--a nonpolicymaking,\nsecretary-clerk serving in roughly equal parts an elective\ncounty executive (County Commissioner) and a non-elective\ncounty administrator (Chief Clerk). Unsurprisingly, none of\nour prior cases carries us effortlessly to a resolution;\nhowever, we find particular guidance in Brown and Zold.\n\nBrown arose from the dismissal of a county assistant\ndirector of public information. In that case, we discussed\nthe difficulty of determining the appropriateness of political-\naffiliation requirements for jobs that entail clerical tasks:\n\n       While Branti provides us with a \"test\" the Supreme\n       Court has not specified the particular factors which\n       indicate that a position falls within the Branti test.\n       Factors suggested by other courts include whether the\n\n                               19\n\f       employee's duties are simply clerical or related to law\n       enforcement, nondiscretionary or technical. Courts\n       have also considered whether the employee participates\n       in Council discussions or other meetings, whether the\n       employee prepares budgets, or has authority to hire or\n       fire employees, the salary of the employee, and the\n       employee's power to control others and to speak in the\n       name of policymakers. In Crisp [v. Bond, 536 F.Supp.\n       137, 139 (W.D. Mo. 1982)], the Court held that the\n       Assistant Director of the Division of Motor Vehicle and\n       Drivers Licensing could not be fired because he had no\n       confidential duties even though he supervised\n       employees, prepared the budget, was liaison with the\n       public, attended conferences, and analyzed\n       administrative procedures and work standards. The\n       key factor seems to be not whether the employee was\n       a supervisor or had a great deal of responsibility but\n       whether the employee has \"meaningful input into\n       decision making concerning the nature and scope of a\n       major township program.\"\n\nBrown, 787 F.2d at 169-70 (citations omitted). In Brown,\nwe concluded: \"While some of [Brown's] duties were only\ntechnical or clerical in nature, her principal duty was to act\nas spokesman for the Commissioners and help promote\ncounty projects. Brown could, therefore, be dismissed\nbecause of her political affiliation without any violation of\nher first amendment rights.\" Id. at 170.\n\nIn Zold, a deputy township clerk challenged her politically\nmotivated dismissal. We reversed the district court's grant\nof summary judgment in favor of the township and\nremanded the case for further proceedings. We observed\nthat the district court appeared to rely on three job\nfunctions in finding that political affiliation was a proper\njob requirement for the deputy clerk position: (1) secretary\nof the Township Committee, in which capacity the deputy\nclerk could have access to confidential information during\nclosed sessions; (2) liaison officer between government\nofficials and taxpayers and between the executive and the\ngeneral body of municipal personnel; and (3) public\nrelations figure. See Zold, 935 F.2d at 637. We\ndistinguished the public relations work performed by Zold\n\n                               20\n\ffrom that conducted by the appellant in Brown based on\nthe fact that Zold was not responsible for writing press\nreleases and speeches of elected officials, or for promoting\ncounty projects, or for acting as spokesperson for the\ncounty commissioners before the press and public. See id.\nat 638. Instead, we reasoned:\n\n       Her contact with the press is generally limited to\n       informing reporters about the agenda of upcoming\n       meetings, and her contact with the public is, as the\n       district court put it, \"receiving inquiries and complaints\n       from the electorate and responding in kind,\" 737\n       F.Supp. at 317, rather than promoting policies.\n       Therefore, Brown does not provide a basis to conclude\n       that the deputy clerk's political affiliation is a job\n       requirement.\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\nAdditionally, we found that the deputy clerk's access to\nconfidential material did not justify a political affiliation job\nrequirement; however this holding was narrowly tailored to\nthe circumstances of Zold:\n\n       Arguably, even though there is no evidence that the\n       clerk or the deputy clerk acts as anything other than a\n       functionary during the closed Committee meetings, the\n       access to confidential information which may be\n       discussed on these occasions might signify that\n       political affiliation, translated in this case into loyalty\n       to the majority party, is a job requirement. Nor do we\n       deny that there is some sensitivity and discretion\n       which must be exercised when the deputy clerk is\n       acting as a liaison or as a spokesman. However, these\n       factors cannot serve to demonstrate the need for party\n       affiliation because virtually all of these functions are\n       duties that the deputy assumes from the clerk. State\n       law makes clear that political affiliation is not a factor\n       in the municipal clerk's position.\n\nId. at 638. Hence, we stated that \"we cannot conclude that\nduties fulfilled by a tenured, nonpolitical appointee\nsuddenly become confidential or political on those\noccasions when the deputy clerk is called to substitute for\nhim.\" Id.\n\n                               21\n\fFinally, we observed:\n\n       The defendants have expressed concern that an\n       employee whose tasks include contact with the public\n       could deliberately harm the government's (and thereby\n       the dominant party's) image in the public eye; one who\n       must provide information to government officials\n       perhaps could deliberately undermine policy decisions\n       or administrative efficacy. However, any government\n       employee, including those with the most routine\n       clerical tasks, could injure the employer's efficiency or\n       public image. A receptionist could put callers on hold\n       and neglect to answer or forward their inquiries; an\n       office clerk could misfile forms, deliberately delay their\n       processing, and treat visitors rudely. The obvious\n       response is that employees who engage in such\n       behavior can be discharged on the basis of their poor\n       job performance. The potential that an employee may\n       cause havoc is in itself no basis for holding the\n       employee can be hired or discharged because of his or\n       her political affiliation.\n\nId. at 639.\n\nIn the present case, the District Court found, at the close\nof discovery, that there were no remaining material issues\nof fact as to whether political affiliation was an appropriate\nrequirement for Armour's position. As we explain in the\nparagraphs which follow, our review of the record yields a\ndifferent conclusion.\n\nWe highlight certain factual disputes that we find\nunsusceptible to resolution at the summary judgment\nstage. First, we note that the District Court undertook to\nweigh the credibility and relative significance of Armour's\nMarch 11, 1998 written comments about her job\ndescription and her subsequent deposition testimony on\nthe subject. Specifically, the District Court characterized\nArmour's deposition testimony as \"contradictory and her\nunbiased statement regarding her job duties as provided in\nMarch 1998 as more significant.\" We think such weighing\nshould have been reserved for the fact-finder.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The District Court relied on Martin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,\nInc., 851 F.2d 703 (3d Cir. 1988) as support for its authority to assess\n\n                               22\n\fIn the same vein, we do not agree with the District Court\nthat Clarke's testimony that she \"represented\" Donatella\nsupports summary judgment. The theme of representation\nwas addressed in the testimony of a number of witnesses;\nhowever, the content of the testimony on the concept of\nrepresentation of the commissioners is less than clear.\nWhereas Clarke testified that she \"represented\" Donatella at\npolitical events, a reasonable fact-finder might conclude\nthat the representation of which she spoke entailed little\nmore than her presence at certain events rather than active\nparticipation as a spokesperson (\"I go just to represent him,\nbe present\"). For her part, Armour testified that it was not\npart of her job to represent Schulte at political events.\nArmour's role at the AFPN meetings--she attended in\nSchulte's stead but Schulte only became aware that\nArmour voted at the meetings after the fact--might also be\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nthe credibility of the later deposition testimony. We find the District\nCourt's reliance on Martin to be misplaced. In Videon Chevrolet, Inc. v.\nGeneral Motors Corporation, 992 F.2d 482 (3d Cir. 1993), we\ndistinguished a situation in which a party gave ambiguous deposition\ntestimony from the situation in Martin and emphasized that the Martin\ncourt had articulated a rule applicable only in extreme circumstances:\n\n       In Martin, the mother of a child born with birth defects made eight\n       sworn factual statements tending to negate liability on the part of\n       the defendant drug manufacturer. Later, facing an almost certain\n       loss on summary judgment, she submitted a flatly contradictory\n       affidavit which contained no explanation for her change in\nposition.\n       We held that on those clear and extreme facts the district court\n       could properly ignore the later affidavit.\n\nVideon Chevrolet, Inc., 992 F.2d at 488. See also Farrell v. Planters\nLifesavers Company, 206 F.3d 271 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nUnlike Martin, in the present case appellant did provide what a fact-\nfinder might regard as a plausible explanation for the differences\nbetween her 1998 written comments about the nature of the secretarial\nposition and her subsequent deposition testimony about the degree of\npolitical involvement, confidentiality, and responsibility required\n(\"[T]he\nconcept I was trying to get across was what I thought the job should be\nmore so than what the job actually is.\"). A fact-finder might not only\nhave accepted the explanation but gone on to credit the deposition\ntestimony of appellant that the District Court declined to give equivalent\nweight to.\n\n                               23\n\finterpreted to support more than one inference regarding\nthe level of representation inherent in the position.\n\nFurther, Armour contends that the fact that the\ncommissioners created a new administrative position above\nthe secretaries, though they never filled that position,\nwould lend support to a finding that the secretarial\npositions did not entail the level of confidentiality or require\nthe type of representation of the commissioners that would\nmake political affiliation a proper job requirement.\nSpecifically, Schulte testified that the never-filled executive\nadministrator position required a college degree because\nthe person in that position \"would, indeed, be representing\nthe three commissioners.\" Of course, the fact that the\nadministrative position was created would not compel a\nfact-finder to conclude that the work of the secretaries and\nthe work of the potential administrator would not have\noverlapped in any respect. However, the creation of the\nadministrative position and the adoption of more\ndemanding requirements for it than for a secretarial\nposition might lead a fact-finder to doubt that a secretarial\nposition was one for which political affiliation was a proper\ningredient.\n\nFinally, we note that the secretaries' contact with\nconstituents, relied on by the District Court in its summary\njudgment ruling, also fails to bear the weight of the\ngovernment's burden on the appropriateness of a political-\naffiliation requirement. It is undisputed that Armour and\nthe other secretaries responded to constituent calls\nand, when possible, handled constituents' requests\nwithout involving the commissioners. We are, however,\nunpersuaded that the fact that the secretaries would\nattempt to handle constituents' requests on their own\nineluctably leads to the conclusion that political affiliation\nwas an appropriate requirement for the job. See Zold, 935\nF.2d at 638 (employee's contact with the public limited to\nreceiving and responding to inquiries and complaints rather\nthan promoting policies did not support a political-\naffiliation requirement).\n\nNeither the County nor Schulte contends that this case\nimplicates the central question in most political patronage\ncases--whether an employee had \"meaningful input into\n\n                               24\n\fdecision making.\" Brown, 787 F.2d at 170. Instead,\nappellees rely on evidence that Armour was entrusted with\naccess to confidential information as part of her job and\nthat a lack of political loyalty would interfere with the\nperformance of her duties. We have, indeed, acknowledged\nthat access to confidential information may support a\npolitical-affiliation job requirement even in the absence of a\ndecision-making function. See Zold, 935 F.2d at 638-39.\nHowever, we have also cautioned against an over reliance\non the factors of confidentiality and loyalty: \"Although\nloyalty and confidentiality of sheriff's deputies are desirable\nattributes, those traits are needed for many working\nrelationships. It has never been suggested that the need for\nloyalty and confidentiality alone supports politically\nmotivated dismissals independent of the tasks which the\nemployee must perform.\" Burns v. County of Cambria, 971\nF.2d 1015, 1023 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1081\n(1993). Here we are faced with the question whether being\nthe personal secretary to a county commissioner is, without\nmore, sufficient evidence to establish as a matter of law\nthat political affiliation is an appropriate job requirement.\nThere is case law that points in this direction. For example,\nin Faughender v. City of North Olmsted, 927 F.2d 909, 914\n(6th Cir. 1991), the Sixth Circuit stated: \"Viewed in its\nfunctional aspect, a mayor's secretary is clearly the type of\nposition that involves access to confidential and political\nmaterial, and political loyalty, whether partisan or personal,\nis an essential attribute of the job.\" But the fact-specific\napproach embraced by this court in Brown and Zold and\nother cases is not in harmony with such a categorical rule.\n\nArmour's \"access to confidential information . . . might\nsignify that political affiliation . . . is a job requirement.\"\nZold, 935 F.2d at 638. However, on the record before us, we\nare unable to so conclude without weighing the evidence--a\ntask that we leave for the fact-finder. If a jury were to credit\nArmour's testimony, and indeed a good deal of the\ntestimony of Donatella and Johnson, it could find that the\njob duties of the commissioner's secretary were more\nanalogous to \"the most routine clerical tasks,\" id. at 639,\nthan to tasks involving a high level of confidentiality.\n\nThus, based on our review of the record, we conclude\n\n                               25\n\fthat, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), genuine disputes\nregarding the nature of Armour's position remain. This\nconclusion is strengthened in that, as mentioned above, the\n\"substantial\" burden of proving that political affiliation is\nan appropriate job requirement remains at all times on the\ngovernmental entity or official seeking to justify the adverse\nemployment action. See Burns, 971 F.2d at 1022.6\n\nB. The Sua Sponte Ruling That Armo ur Was Not Fired\nfor Political Reasons\n\nWe turn now to the District Court's alternative basis for\ngranting summary judgment--namely, that Armour failed\nto come forward with evidence linking her termination to\nher perceived political affiliation.\n\nIn order to prevail on a First Amendment claim of\ndiscrimination, a public employee must prove \"that the\nemployee's political affiliation was a substantial or\nmotivating factor in the adverse employment decision.\"\nRobertson v. Fiore, 62 F.3d 596, 599 (3d Cir. 1995). In this\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Our dissenting colleague observes that \"[w]e have previously declared\nsummary judgment appropriate in political dismissal cases, depending,\nof course, on the facts. Boyle, 139 F.3d at 397; Ness, 660 F.2d at 522.\nThis is such a case.\"\n\nNess is authority for the proposition that\"[w]here, as a matter of law,\na person is determined to have occupied a policymaking position, that\nperson's claims to protection from patronage dismissal under Elrod and\nBranti are disposable on a motion for summary judgment.\" Id. What was\nsaid in Ness must, of course, be read in the context of the Supreme\nCourt's recital in Branti \"that party affiliation is not necessarily\nrelevant\nto every policymaking or confidential position.\" 445 U.S. at 518. We do\nnot understand the dissent to contend that Armour's position could\nproperly be characterized as \"policymaking.\" On the other hand, there is\ncertainly evidence of record that some of Armour's responsibilities were\n\"confidential.\" However, the record does not compel the inference that, as\na matter of law, the totality, or even the bulk, of Armour's\nresponsibilities were \"confidential.\" Accordingly, determining whether the\ndefendants, on whom the burden rests, have been able to establish that\nArmour's job falls outside the protections of Elrod and Branti is a matter\nfor the factfinder, not for the District Court on summary judgment. As\nwe noted in Boyle, \"at the summary judgment stage, a court may not\nweigh the evidence or make credibility determinations; these tasks are\nleft to the factfinder.\" 139 F.3d at 393.\n\n                               26\n\fcase, appellees had submitted a summary judgment motion\nto the District Court that was directed at the\nappropriateness of requiring political affiliation in the\nsecretarial position. In that summary judgment motion\nappellees acknowledged that the issue of whether Armour's\nfiring was politically motivated \"involve[s] disputes over\nissues of material fact best left for trial.\" Nevertheless, when\nruling on the parties' motions, the District Court sua sponte\naddressed the issue of why Armour was fired.\n\nWe need not reach the merits of the District Court's sua\nsponte disposition of the causation issue because the\nDistrict Court did not, prior to its ruling, notify the parties\nthat the issue would be addressed. Our holding in Otis\nElevator Co. v. George Washington Hotel Corp., 27 F.3d 903\n(3d Cir. 1994), is controlling. In Otis Elevator Co., \"[t]he\ndistrict court not only denied [defendant's] motion for\nsummary judgment with respect to count IV, it granted\nsummary judgment for [plaintiff] with respect to that count,\nsua sponte.\" Id. at 909. We noted that even though the\ndistrict court's decision was \"understandable given the\nstate of the record,\" \"it nonetheless constituted error under\nRule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\" and,\naccordingly, we vacated the order. Id. at 910.\n\nThus, we cannot sustain the District Court's sua sponte\nruling that appellant failed to adduce facts that would\nsupport an inference that she was fired on the basis of her\npolitical affiliation.\n\nIII Conclusion\n\nBecause we conclude that there are material issues of\nfact for the fact-finder and because the District Court did\nnot provide notice to the parties that it would reach the\nquestion of causation on summary judgment, the order of\nthe District Court granting summary judgment in favor of\nappellees is reversed. The case is remanded to the District\nCourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                               27\n\fSCIRICA, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\nThroughout most of Pennsylvania's counties, the county\ncommissioners constitute both the executive and the\nlegislative branch of government, \"generally regulating the\naffairs of the county.\" 16 Pa. Cons. Stat. S 509(a) (1955).1\nAs such, the commissioners are the chief political and\ngovernmental authorities, exercising all the corporate\npowers of the county. Id. S 512. With respect to county\naffairs, commissioners have long been vested with vast\ndiscretionary powers. Kistler v. Carbon County , 35 A.2d\n733, 739 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1944).\n\nDespite their many governmental duties, Beaver County\nCommissioners employ only one secretary apiece. Because\nof the manifold demands placed on County Commissioner\nBea Schulte, her secretary, Dolores Armour, performed\nmany tasks requiring confidentiality and high levels of\nresponsibility. With significant political and administrative\nduties, Armour functioned as more than a clerical\nsecretary. Armour was an integral component of the\ncommissioner's office, helping Schulte to serve her\nconstituents effectively.\n\nIn Elrod v. Burns, the Supreme Court held a political\nemployee who \"acts as an advisor or formulates plans for\nthe implementation of broad goals\" may be dismissed\nbecause of her political beliefs without violating the First\nAmendment. 427 U.S. 347, 368 (1976) (Brennan, J.,\nplurality opinion). The Court also noted that \"[n]o clear line\ncan be drawn between policymaking and nonpolicymaking\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. This is true in counties of the Third to Eighth Classes, comprising\nsixty-two of Pennsylvania's sixty-seven counties. Philadelphia is\nPennsylvania's only First Class county, with more than 1,500,000\ninhabitants (1,585,577 in the last census). Allegheny is a Second Class\ncounty, with a population between 800,000 and 1,500,000 inhabitants\n(1,336,449). There are three Second Class A counties, with populations\nranging from 500,000 to 800,000 inhabitants: Montgomery (678,111),\nDelaware (547,651), and Bucks (541,174). Beaver is a Fourth Class\ncounty, with a population between 150,000 and 225,000 inhabitants\n(186,093). In counties from the Third to Eighth Classes, excepting home-\nrule counties, the executive and legislative officers are the county\ncommissioners.\n\n                               28\n\fpositions\" and that \"[t]he nature of the[employee's]\nresponsibilities is critical.\" Id. at 367. Four years later, in\nBranti v. Finkel, the Supreme Court stated the ultimate\n\"question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate\nthat party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the\nperformance of the public office involved,\" taking into\naccount the \"vital interest in maintaining governmental\neffectiveness and efficiency.\" 445 U.S. 507, 517-18 (1980).\n\nRecent cases have clarified how courts should determine\nwhether the dismissal of political-patronage employees, like\nDolores Armour, pass constitutional muster. This\n\"functional analysis\" may turn, for example, on whether a\ndifference in political affiliation between employer and\nemployee will be \"highly likely to cause an official to be\nineffective in carrying out\" the official's duties. Ness v.\nMarshall, 660 F.2d 517, 521 (3d Cir. 1981) (finding city\nsolicitors' party affiliations relevant to the performance of\ntheir responsibilities). If so, the employee's dismissal does\nnot violate the First Amendment.2 Of course, as the District\nCourt here observed, \"the constitutional limitations on\npolitical patronage extend to intraparty political disputes as\nwell as interparty political disputes.\" Opinion at 3 (citing\nRobertson v. Fiore, 62 F.3d 596, 601-02 (3d Cir. 1995)).\n\nAs the majority acknowledges, \"access to confidential\ninformation may support a political-affiliation job\nrequirement even in the absence of a decision-making\nfunction.\" Supra at 25 (citing Zold v. Township of Mantua,\n935 F.2d 633, 638-39 (3d Cir. 1991)). Given the sensitive\ncorrespondence, resolutions, telephone messages, and\npartisan material arriving in the commissioner's office each\nday, Commissioner Schulte needed a loyal lieutenant. If\nArmour's political loyalties diverged from her employer's, it\nwould appear that she should not be constitutionally\nprotected against dismissal from her confidential post.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. See, e.g., Boyle v. County of Allegheny Pa., 139 F.3d 386, 396 (3d Cir.\n1998); Wetzel v. Tucker, 139 F.3d 380, 384 (3d Cir. 1998); Waskovich v.\nMorgano, 2 F.3d 1292, 1297 (3d Cir. 1993). A similar test was employed\nby the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in a case the majority cites\nfor support of a \"categorical rule,\" Faughender v. City of North Olmstead,\n927 F.2d 909, 914 (6th Cir. 1991). Faughender was also an appeal from\nsummary judgment.\n\n                               29\n\fThe majority properly refuses to \"overrel[y]\" on Armour's\naccess to confidential information. But the testimony\nunmistakably demonstrated more than Armour's access to\nconfidential information. It also proved that Armour\nperformed administrative and political tasks requiring\ndiscretion and judgment. Armour served as Schulte's\nprivate secretary and administrative assistant from January\n1996 through February 1999. During that period, she\nattended meetings of the Aliquippa Family Preservation\nNetwork on Schulte's behalf, sometimes voting her proxy.\nWhenever possible, Armour answered constituents'\nrequests herself. Armour also attended political functions\nand fundraisers with Schulte, testifying these events were\ndesigned \"to get [Schulte's] name out.\" Furthermore,\nArmour acted as the liaison between Schulte and\ndepartment heads. Admitting that her duties required\npolitical acumen, Armour testified \"[t]he high level of\nconfidentiality and responsibility reaches far beyond the\ndesk, often into our personal lives.\" Armour also conceded\nthat political affiliation was an appropriate requirement for\nher position and that she would never have been hired had\nshe not actively supported Schulte's 1996 successful\ncampaign for office.3 As the District Court noted:\n\n       Each time [Armour] responded to a concern of a\n       constituent, she was representing Schulte in a political\n       nature. It is likely that Democratic constituents who\n       seek redress from their Democratic commissioner, or\n       simply express concerns of a political nature, expect\n       that the commissioner's secretary shares their political\n       ideology. In other words, Democratic constituents\n       should find comfort in expressing their concerns to the\n       commissioner's secretary, whom the voters felt would\n       express or relay the issues accurately and\n       compassionately to the commissioner.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Armour became involved in Schulte's campaign for county\ncommissioner when Schulte's husband, a Pennsylvania district justice,\nasked Armour to assist his wife. Armour testified she did \"[w]hatever was\nasked\" in the campaign, including attending organizational meetings and\nfunctions, driving Schulte to the polling places, and posting Schulte's\nsigns throughout the county. After Schulte's election, the commissioner-\nelect asked Armour to serve as her secretary, which Armour immediately\naccepted. Armour began working the day Schulte took her oath of office.\n\n                               30\n\fOpinion at 11-12.\n\nIn addition to this evidence, the District Court considered\ntestimony from others regarding the role of commissioners'\nsecretaries. Beaver County Commissioner Dan Donatella\ndeclared his secretary \"operates as his eyes and ears, both\npolitically and otherwise.\" Jo Johnson, secretary to Beaver\nCounty Commissioner Nancy Loxley, testified her position\nrequired political loyalty because Loxley discussed in\nconfidence political as well as party issues. Both Johnson\nand Joan Clarke, secretary to Commissioner Donatella,\ndescribed their jobs as \"political.\" Clarke testified that she\nrepresented Commissioner Donatella \"when I am anywhere\npolitically.\"\n\nIn light of their duties, the Beaver County\nCommissioners' secretaries functioned as political and\ngovernmental assistants. Cf. Branti, 445 U.S. at 517. Other\nCourts of Appeals have repeatedly concluded policymakers'\nassistants' jobs are not protected by the First Amendment.4\nThe District Court correctly reached the same result in this\ncase.\n\nArmour's duties were constitutionally indistinguishable\nfrom those of a mayor's secretary. As the Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit held, \"Viewed in its functional aspect,\na mayor's secretary is clearly the type of position that\ninvolves access to confidential and political material, and\npolitical loyalty . . . is an essential attribute of the job.\"\nFaughender, 927 F.2d at 914. It is difficult to imagine that\nthe Mayor of Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, or the President of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. E.g., Baker v. Hadley, 167 F.3d 1014, 1019 (6th Cir. 1999) (upholding\ndismissal of employees in county auditor's office where the auditor\nintended the positions to be \"confidential, policymaking jobs for which\npolitical affiliation was an appropriate requirement\"); Soderstrum v. Town\nof Grand Isle, 925 F.2d 135, 140-41 (5th Cir. 1991) (finding a police\nchief's secretary was a \"confidential employee,\" based in part on a\n\"realistic understanding of the confidential relationship between\nsecretaries and their bosses\"); Savage v. Gorski, 850 F.2d 64, 68 (2d Cir.\n1988) (noting political affiliation is \"an appropriate requirement when\nthere is a rational connection between shared ideology and job\nperformance\"); Santiago-Correa v. Hernandez-Colon, 835 F.2d 395, 397\n(1st Cir. 1987) (observing political officials may fire \"'confidential'\nemployees, like personal secretaries\" because of\"political affiliation\").\n\n                               31\n\ftheir City Councils, would be unable to employ a secretary\nwho was not politically loyal.5 County commissioners in\nFourth Class counties, representing the executive and\nlegislative branches of government, must have at least as\nmuch right as mayors to employ secretaries who further the\ncommissioners' political and governmental agendas.\n\nNevertheless, the majority finds summary judgment\ninappropriate because of conflicting evidence whether a\ncommissioner's secretary is \"clerical\" in nature. Supra at\n25. As we noted in Zold, \"When the issue on appeal turns\non a constitutional fact . . . appellate courts have the\nobligation to give such facts special scrutiny. . . . An\nappellate court in such instances may draw its own\ninference from facts in the record.\" 935 F.2d at 636. I see\nno outstanding issues that require factual resolution. That\nthe District Court must apply a functional, case-specific\ntest does not render summary judgment inapplicable. We\nhave previously declared summary judgment appropriate in\npolitical-dismissal cases, depending, of course, on the facts.\nBoyle, 139 F.3d at 397; Ness, 660 F.2d at 522. This is such\na case.\n\nApplying the same test as the District Court, I find no\n\"genuine issue of material fact,\" FED . R. CIV. P. 56(c), after\naffording the non-moving party all \"reasonable inferences,\"\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., 530 U.S. 133,\n150 (2000). Nor do I find \"reasonable\" an inference that\nArmour's duties were primarily clerical. An officeholder's\n\"clerical\" employees do not vote her proxies, resolve\nconstituents' requests, or have access to the office's most\nsensitive and confidential political and governmental\ninformation, as did Armour. The District Court held,\"In\nessence, plaintiff was a conduit between the Democratic\nconstituents and Commissioner Schulte, their elected\nrepresentative.\" Opinion at 12.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. As noted in Faughender, \"A mayor's secretary must undertake those\nfunctions in relation to the flow of information, whether by writing,\nspeech, or personal visit, to and from the mayor's office, that the mayor\nwants the secretary to perform. A particular secretary's duties may be\ncircumscribed, but the function of the office is constant.\" 927 F.2d at\n913-14.\n\n                                32\n\f6. I would also affirm the District Court's alternative holding -- that\nArmour did not demonstrate her support of Joseph Askar for a local\njudgeship was a \"substantial or motivating factor\" in her termination.\nOpinion at 12-14. The evidence demonstrated Schulte only questioned\nArmour once about her involvement with Askar, and Armour denied any\n\"direct\" involvement with Askar's campaign. With no other evidentiary\nsupport, Armour did not meet her burden of proving that her political\naffiliations led to her dismissal.\nThe majority frames the issue as whether summary\njudgment was appropriate, given Armour was a\n\"nonpolicymaking, secretary-clerk serving in roughly equal\nparts an elective county executive (County Commissioner)\nand a non-elective county administrator (Chief Clerk).\"\nSupra at 19. I do not read the court's opinion as an attempt\nto segregate Armour's duties between the \"political\" and the\n\"nonpolitical.\" Of course, were that the standard, \"political\"\nemployees in state or municipal government would be\nvirtually nonexistent. Necessity demands the staffs of\nelected officials perform several tasks -- governmental,\npolitical, administrative, and clerical. Clerical duties, even if\nthey are \"roughly equal\" to more specialized obligations, do\nnot render those employees \"nonpolitical.\"\n\nThe District Court found that an \"absence of political\ncohesion\" between Armour and Schulte would potentially\ndamage the commissioner's work, rendering Armour an\nemployee subject to dismissal on political grounds. Opinion\nat 12, quoted supra at 14-16. Having reviewed the record,\nI would agree.6\n\nBecause I would affirm the judgment of the District\nCourt, I respectfully dissent.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               33\n\f",

Additionally, the District Court found,\nsua sponte, that appellant had failed to adduce sufficient\nevidence to enable a fact-finder to infer that her termination\nwas politically motivated--i.e., to infer that, as Armour\ncontended, Schulte decided to terminate her based on the\nperception that Armour was supporting a candidate other\nthan the one backed by Schulte in a campaign for a local\njudgeship.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we reverse.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural Overview\n\nArmour and Schulte met when Armour volunteered to\nwork on Schulte's 1995 campaign as a Democratic\ncandidate for the office of County Commissioner. Armour\nwas one of a number of people working on Schulte's\ncampaign. As part of her involvement in the campaign,\n\n                                 2\n\fArmour attended campaign committee meetings, traveled\nwith Schulte to polling locations and political functions,\nattended fund-raising events, and placed Schulte's signs\nthroughout the voting district. After winning the election,\nSchulte offered to hire Armour as her secretary. Armour\naccepted and began her employment as Schulte's secretary\nin January 1996. According to Armour's deposition\ntestimony, once hired, she relinquished her political role\nand turned her attention to the clerical tasks of the job, at\nleast during work hours. Armour testified that she spent\napproximately half of her time working for Schulte and\nthat, in the balance of her time, Armour--like the other\ncommissioners' secretaries--performed clerical tasks under\nthe supervision of the Chief Clerk of the County. Armour\ntestified that in January, 1999, Joseph Askar, a Democrat\nseeking election to a local judgeship, approached her with\nlogistical questions about running a campaign; she\nanswered Askar's questions but took no other action on his\nbehalf. The parties agree that in early February Schulte\nlearned of Armour's contact with Askar--who was running\nagainst the Democratic candidate supported by Schulte and\nthe local party establishment--and questioned Armour\nabout her involvement with Askar's campaign.\n\nAt about the same time, Armour proposed that the\nCounty create a human service coordinator position and\nhire her for the position. Schulte testified that she raised\nthe possibility with the other commissioners and that they\ndecided against creating the position. Instead, in late\nFebruary, 1999, Schulte offered Armour a part-time clerical\nposition at a geriatric center earning a lower salary and\nasked Armour to go home and think about the offer. 1 The\nnext day Armour took a personal day off. The testimony of\nSchulte and Armour indicates that, on February 26, when\nArmour was next in the office, Schulte asked Armour\nwhether she had made a decision about taking the geriatric\ncenter position. Schulte testified that \"[Armour] told me\nthat I would have to speak to her attorney.\" Armour\ntestified that she told Schulte that \"if [Schulte] had some\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Schulte testified that she did not know at the time that the position\nwas part-time; however, Armour testified that she, Armour, was aware\nthat the position was part-time when it was offered.\n\n                               3\n\fwork for me to do I'd be more than happy to go back to her\noffice, but if it was about the job offer, I was requesting she\nwait until my attorney was present to discuss it.\" App. at\n77 (Armour Dep. at 101). The parties are in agreement that\nSchulte then advised Armour that she was terminated.\n\nArmour filed suit under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 in the United\nStates District Court for the Western District of\nPennsylvania against the County and also against Schulte\nin her individual capacity. The County and Schulte moved\nfor summary judgment on the ground that political\naffiliation was an appropriate job requirement for the\nposition of secretary to a Beaver County Commissioner. In\ntheir summary judgment motion, appellees acknowledged\nthat the question whether Armour was fired based on her\npolitical affiliation \"involve[s] disputes over issues of\nmaterial fact best left for trial.\" The District Court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Schulte and the County\nbased both on the appropriateness of a political-affiliation\njob requirement and on the lack of evidence that Armour's\npolitical affiliation was the cause of her termination.\n\nII Standard of Review\n\nWe exercise plenary review of the District Court's decision\nto grant summary judgment.

The Nature of the Secretarial Position\n\nNone of the parties contends that Armour was a policy-\nmaker in her position as secretary to Schulte. But the\nparties disagree as to the level of confidentiality,\nloyalty, and political trust required in the position. There\nare three Beaver County Commissioners. At the time in\nquestion, there were two Democrats--Commissioner\nSchulte and Commissioner Dan Donatella--and one\nRepublican--Commissioner Nancy Loxley. Joann Clarke\nwas Donatella's secretary and Jo Johnson was Loxley's\nsecretary.2 According to the testimony of Donatella,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Clarke and Johnson were both hired by previous commissioners and\nthen retained by Donatella and Loxley, respectively.\n\n                               5\n\falthough as a formal matter all three commissioners had\njoint authority over personnel decisions regarding the\ncommissioners' secretaries, it was understood among the\ncommissioners that each commissioner had the power to\nhire and fire his or her own secretary.\n\nThe three secretaries shared the same office space and,\ndepending on availability, they would perform routine tasks\nfor any one of the commissioners. Armour testified that she\ndevoted fifty to sixty percent of her time to performing work\nfor the Chief Clerk. Clarke testified that tasks assigned to\nher by the Chief Clerk filled approximately sixty percent of\nher working hours. In working for the Chief Clerk and in\nworking for the commissioners, the secretaries spent the\nbulk of their time performing such clerical tasks as typing\ncorrespondence, resolutions and motions; answering\nphones; greeting and directing visitors to the office;\nhandling paperwork; opening mail; making photocopies;\nmaking travel arrangements; scheduling meetings; filing\ndocuments; directing checks to the proper departments;\nand obtaining signatures. Armour also scheduled the board\nmeetings which required the presence of the entire board,\nmade photocopies of all mail received that was relevant to\nthe entire board, and took minutes at public board\nmeetings when Johnson was not available to do so.\nAdditionally, she attended monthly meetings of the\nAliquippa Family Preservation Network (\"AFPN\") in\nSchulte's stead. At these meetings she took notes and voted\nas Schulte's proxy. In testimony, Armour described her role\nat those meetings as follows:\n\n       [I]t was not a real important board, they didn't really\n       deal with a lot of issues other than trying to get\n       themselves established and there were things that\n       would have to be voted on, like paying the bills, this\n       person going to conference or whatever. I didn't sit in\n       on the executive board and have privy to the decision\n       making, but the regular minutes, if it called for a vote,\n       yes.\n\nApp. at 69 (Armour Dep. at 48). As to Armour's\nparticipation in the AFPN meetings, Schulte testified: \"[A]t\nthe time I didn't realize that she had the power to vote, but\nI found out later that she was, indeed, voting in my stead.\"\n\n                               6\n\fApp. at 54 (Schulte Dep. at 21). Armour maintained in her\ndeposition testimony that, although she did not end her\nown political involvement, she stopped accompanying\nSchulte to political functions at the close of the 1995\ncampaign. Also, Armour testified that none of the\nsecretaries was privy to personnel matters or files; the\ntestimony of Clarke and Johnson is not to the contrary.3\n\nIn 1996, Armour suggested that a position of office\nmanager for the commissioners be created and that she be\nappointed to the position. Schulte testified that she\nproposed this to the other commissioners but that they\nwere not in favor of the idea. App. at 56 (Schulte Dep. at\n31)(\"I'm sure they did not want to have their secretaries\nsubject to my secretary.\"). In 1997, the commissioners\ndecided to create an executive administrative position\ndirectly under the commissioners and on par with the Chief\nClerk. In her testimony, Schulte emphasized that the\nperson in the executive administrative position, as that\nposition was envisioned, would have performed \"strictly\nexecutive administrative-type duties and . . . represent the\ncommissioners.\" The position was created and funded but\nnever filled because, according to Schulte's testimony, the\ncommissioners could not decide on who should be hired.\nMoreover, it seems that Armour was not seriously\nconsidered for this position because the commissioners had\ndecided that a college degree--which Armour did not\nhave--was a requirement for the job. Schulte testified:\n\n       Delores' husband called me and wanted to know why\n       we had included a requirement for a college degree for\n       that position, because that eliminated Delores from\n       consideration. . . . I told him that I included--had\n       included that requirement, because this person would,\n       indeed, be representing the three commissioners, and\n       we felt that was a necessary--all the commissioners\n       had agreed that would be a necessary requirement.\n\nApp. at 56 (Schulte Dep. at 32).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. However, when enumerating his secretary's duties in deposition\ntestimony, Donatella mentioned that his secretary had some involvement\nin payroll.\n\n                               7\n\fOn March 11, 1998, Armour completed a document\nentitled \"Class Specification Review & Comment\".\nDirections for completing the form stated, in pertinent part:\n\n       Please review the attached classification specification\n       to make sure it accurately describes the body of work\n       you perform. Please note that in many cases, it will not\n       identify every task that you specifically perform. When\n       you see the words: May perform other duties, including\n       work in other functional areas this means that within\n       the list of duties you should find the essential duties\n       that you regularly perform.\n\n       If you believe some essential duties have been\n       omitted, or a part of the specification is inaccurate;\n       please indicate this below.\n\nApp. at 93 (emphasis in original).\n\nAppellant typed the following response on the space\nprovided:\n\n       Although this job may appear secretarial in nature, a\n       large portion of the duties fall more towards\n       administrative assistant. The high level of\n       confidentiality and responsibility reaches far beyond\n       the desk, often into our personal lives. A broad\n       background in County government is essential for even\n       the entry level of this position.\n\nId.\n\nThe form was signed by Armour and initialed by Schulte.\nIn deposition testimony, Armour explained this statement\nby saying: \"[T]he concept I was trying to get across was\nwhat I thought the job should be more so than what the job\nactually is.\" Asked whether she viewed her position as a\nconfidential position, Armour testified: \"I viewed it as a\nsecretary. Of course all secretaries have some confidence to\ntheir boss, regardless of their position.\" App. at 69 (Armour\nDep. at 49). Asked if she would describe the position as\nrequiring a high degree of confidentiality, Armour\nresponded, \"I would say normal.\" Id.\n\nArmour's description of the position in her deposition\ntestimony stands in some tension with the statements of\n\n                               8\n\fother witnesses. Schulte testified that Armour was privy to\nconfidential material through her access to lists of\nresolutions and motions from commissioners' meetings,\ncorrespondence among commissioners, Schulte's telephone\ncalls, and her personal calendar. Schulte also testified that\nArmour \"would often talk to department heads setting up\nmeetings and explaining the purpose of the meeting. That\nwas a very important part of her function. If she didn't\nunderstand the purpose of the meeting, then she couldn't\nexplain it, and often the meetings were involving\nconfidential matters.\" App. at 54 (Schulte Dep. at 21-22).\n\nWhen asked to describe the secretarial position,\nDonatella testified as follows:\n\n       The secretary obviously in that capacity works very\n       close with the county commissioner whom she's\n       affiliated with because of the fact that you need a good\n       close relationship. As a matter of fact, I do believe that\n       they were classified as confidential secretaries and not\n       come under the realm of the union, because each\n       commissioner was at liberty to select that particular\n       employee because of the relationship that they needed\n       to maintain.\n\nApp. at 44 (Donatella Dep. at 6).\n\nDonatella also testified, with respect to the duties that\nhis secretary performed:\n\n       She does everything from answering the telephone for\n       me to doing confidential letters, even sometimes\n       arranging meetings. Doing not only my clerical work,\n       but frankly, operating as my eyes and ears, both\n       political and otherwise. She helps me even on the\n       political end of it, arranging for different political\n       functions and so forth.\n\nId. (Donatella Dep. at 6-7). There may, however, be room for\nmore than one interpretation of Donatella's testimony\nregarding the nature of the secretarial position. For\nexample, Donatella testified:\n\n       [B]asically, they do everything that any other\n       confidential secretary would do as far as even running\n       the office side is concerned. They do resolutions, they\n\n                               9\n\f       get signatures, payroll, act as receptionist, they do\n       typing and all the other secretarial skills that's\n       required.\n\nId.\n\nAsked to explain what he meant when he said the\nsecretaries \"do resolutions,\" Donatella clarified his\ntestimony by stating that the resolutions are prepared by\nthe law department and the secretaries' responsibilities are\nlimited to (a) ensuring that the commissioners sign the\ncompleted resolutions and (b) mailing the resolutions to the\nproper places.\n\nWhen Donatella was asked whether political affiliation\nwas required for a commissioner's secretary, he testified:\n\n       Well, I don't know if it's a requirement, no; but mainly,\n       it is associated with that because on the campaign\n       trail, usually those people are directly or indirectly\n       involved in the campaign, helping that individual to be\n       elected. But I have seen where sometimes someone is\n       selected that is not involved in the campaign. . . . It's\n       whomever that commissioner feels comfortable with I\n       think is the bottom line. They have to be capable of\n       doing the job at hand, and it always helps to be\n       politically astute, obviously.\n\nId. at 45 (Donatella Dep. at 9). Amplifying the connection\nbetween politics and the secretarial position, Donatella\nexplained:\n\n       [G]enerally, if a Republican is a commissioner, they are\n       going to hire a Republican secretary and the other way\n       around. I don't know of any case where it was other\n       than that. I do [not] remember a Democrat hiring a\n       Republican or vice versa, at least to my knowledge in\n       the 35 years I was there. They are generally the same\n       party, if that's the question.\n\nId. (Donatella Dep. at 10).\n\nThe testimony of Johnson, secretary to Commissioner\nLoxley, reinforces appellees' argument that Armour's\nposition required a significant level of confidentiality: \"The\nwork that I do for Nancy [Loxley] I would consider to be of\n\n                                10\n\fa confidential nature, not so much the general work that I\ndo for [the Chief Clerk] . . .\" App. at 85 (Johnson Dep. at\n36). With respect to her work for Loxley, Johnson testified:\n\"[I]t's a political atmosphere here, and Nancy would often\ntimes talk to me in confidence about political issues, party\nissues that I would have to keep to myself and not be able\nto share with anybody else.\" Id. However, portions of\nJohnson's testimony indicate some question as to the\nsubstance behind her more general assertions regarding\nthe nature of the job. Asked whether there were any other\nsources of confidential information beyond the above\nreferenced conversations with Loxley, such as letters or\nphone calls, Johnson testified: \"No. Her correspondence\nthat she got in typically, unless it was something political\nin nature, if it was county related, all three commissioners\nwould get the same correspondence.\" Id. Additionally,\nJohnson testified that she had not been questioned about\nher political affiliation during her interview for the position,\nthat she did not consider herself a political adviser, and\nthat her political affiliation did not play any role in her\nability to keep information confidential. Johnson also\nprovided an affidavit in which she stated that Armour used\nto identify herself as Schulte's \"confidential secretary\" when\nshe answered the phone. However, Armour denied having\nso identified herself.\n\nClarke, Donatella's secretary, testified that \"my\nresponsibility, of course, is to represent [Donatella] and to\nkeep all confidentiality\". App. at 89 (Clarke Dep. at 9).\nClarke's testimony brings into focus the seeming ambiguity\nof the term \"represent\" as used by the parties and\nwitnesses. Asked about her participation in active\ncampaigning, Clarke testified that she served as Donatella's\ncampaign treasurer (usually performing these tasks during\nevening and weekend hours) and would assist Donatella\nwith his campaign at his request: \"I represent\nCommissioner Donatella mainly when I am anywhere\npolitically. I'm there basically to assist him, if that's--you\nknow, if I am to represent him at a function or if I am to be\nthere just to be, you know, part of the event.\" App. at 91\n(Clarke Dep. at 34). Additional questions on this topic\nresulted in the following exchange:\n\n                               11\n\f       Q: Do you consider yourself to be a political advisor to\n       [Donatella]?\n\n       A: Inform him of happenings or go in his behalf? I\n       don't understand.\n\n       Q: Do you advise him on policies for the county?\n\n       A: No.\n\n       Q: But you occasionally go to functions on his behalf?\n\n       A: Not for him. Basically, I will go part of.\n\n       Q: Do you go to tell him what happened at the\n       functions, or what do you mean?\n\n       A: No, I don't, I go just to represent him, be present,\n       that if -- there may be five or six events going on\n       in one evening, and so he's represented.\n\n       . . .\n\n       Q: Okay. Do you give speeches or anything of that\n       nature at those kinds of functions?\n\n       A: No.\n\nId. (Clarke Dep. at 34-35).\n\nB. The Reason for Armour's Termination\n\nWe now turn to the evidence in the record regarding the\nreason for Armour's termination.\n\nArmour contends that rumors of her involvement with\nJoseph Askar's campaign for District Justice in Centre\nTownship motivated Schulte to fire her. It is undisputed\nthat Schulte was aware of such rumors. According to\nArmour's testimony, in January 1999, while Armour was\nstill employed as Schulte's secretary, Askar, a Democrat,\napproached Armour with questions about the mechanics of\nconducting his campaign. Armour contends, and appellees\ndo not dispute, that she merely answered Askar's questions\non topics such as how many signs were required to cover\na certain voting district. It appears to be undisputed that\nSchulte was told in early February, 1999 that Armour\nintended to support Askar instead of Joseph Zupsic, the\nDemocratic candidate supported by Schulte. Donatella\n\n                               12\n\ftestified that he and Schulte were present at a rally when\nsomeone told Donatella \"that I'd better find Bea Schulte\nbecause Joe Schaffer, the town chair, was extremely upset\nbecause allegedly Dee [Armour] was working for Joe Askar.\"\nApp. at 47 (Donatella Dep. at 20). Donatella testified\nfurther:\n\n       So I went and found Bea and I said, \"Bea, there's a\n       problem, I think you better go talk to Mr. Schaffer\n       because he is saying that your employee is working for\n       Joe Askar.\" So I escorted her over to Mr. Schaffer and\n       Mr. Zupsic, who was the other candidate, and they\n       confronted her with and accused her that Dee\n       [Armour], her employee, was working for Mr. Zupsic's\n       opposition. Bea's comment in my presence was that\n       she would find out about what was going on, she was\n       not aware of that but she would talk to Dee.\n\nId. It is undisputed that on one occasion early in February\nof 1999, Schulte did question Armour about her\ninvolvement in Askar's campaign. Armour testified that\nSchulte called her into Schulte's office and said:\"I'm getting\nflak over you supporting Joe Askar.\" App. at 70 (Armour\nDep. at 53). According to Armour, Schulte asked a number\nof questions about Armour's involvement with Askar's\ncampaign. For example, Armour testified that Schulte\nasked her whether she was holding \"coffee klatches\"--small\ngrass-roots meetings to introduce a candidate to voters--for\nAskar, and that in reply she had explained that she was\nnot involved in Askar's campaign but had answered some\nsimple questions. Later that day, Armour approached\nSchulte and told her that she was upset about being\nquestioned about what she did in her personal time. Some\ntwo to three weeks later, on February 26, 1999, Schulte\ndischarged Armour.\n\nDespite his acknowledgment that there was concern\nregarding Armour's possible involvement with Askar's\ncampaign, Donatella testified that he was not under the\nimpression that Armour's termination was related to her\nperceived support of Askar, nor had he heard rumors that\nArmour lost her job for that reason. Rather, Donatella\ntestified that he attributed Armour's termination to a\ndeterioration of the relationship between Armour and\n\n                                13\n\fSchulte that, according to Donatella, had begun\napproximately six months prior to Armour's termination.\n\nC. The District Court's Opinion\n\nWith the foregoing synopsis of the record in view, we turn\nto the District Court's ruling granting summary judgment\nin favor of Schulte and the County. The District Court\nmade the following assessment of Armour's testimony about\nthe nature of her position:\n\n       Plaintiff completed [the March 11, 1998] job description\n       [in which she described the position as entailing a\n       \"high level of confidentiality\"] before any alleged\n       problems between herself and Schulte. We thus\n       consider her deposition testimony [in which she\n       described the position as entailing a \"normal\" level of\n       confidentiality] as contradictory and her unbiased\n       statement regarding her job duties as provided in\n       March 1998 as more significant.

See, e.g., Brown, 787 F.2d at 170 (while some\nof [plaintiff's] duties were only technical or clerical in\nnature, her principal duty was to act as spokesman for\nthe Commissioners). It is likely that Democratic\nconstituents who seek redress from their Democratic\ncommissioner, or simply express concerns of a political\nnature, expect that the commissioners' secretary shares\ntheir political ideology. In other words, Democratic\nconstituents should find comfort in expressing their\nconcerns to the commissioner's secretary, whom the\nvoters felt would express or relay the issues accurately\nand compassionately to the commissioner.

Second, the\nDistrict Court held that Armour's argument that her\n\" `perceived' political affiliation with Askar's campaign was a\nsubstantial or motivating factor in Schulte's decision to\nterminate her\" was \"without merit\" because Schulte\nquestioned Armour about her involvement with Askar's\ncampaign on only one occasion.

Finally, the District\nCourt credited testimony of Donatella and Schulte that\nindicated that Armour was fired because her relationship\nwith Schulte had deteriorated independently of any\ntensions that were caused by Armour's perceived\nconnection with Joseph Askar.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nFirst, we will consider whether, as the District Court\nheld, the record on appellees' motion for summary\njudgment mandated a finding that political affiliation was\nan appropriate requirement for Armour's job. Second, we\nwill consider whether, as the District Court held sua\nsponte, appellees were entitled to summary judgment on\nthe alternate ground that Armour had failed to present any\nsignificant evidence that her firing was attributable to\npolitical affiliation.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4.

Armour's Job\n\nAt least at one time--namely, during Schulte's 1995\ncampaign--Delores Armour's relationship with Bea Schulte\ncould have been characterized as political in nature. It is\nless clear that Armour's position as secretary to Schulte\nrequired a shared political purpose. The question before\nthis court is whether defendants have established, beyond\nfactual dispute, that political agreement was an appropriate\nrequirement for the position of secretary to a Beaver County\nCommissioner.\n\nAdverse employment actions against government\nemployees that are based on political affiliation are, as a\ngeneral rule, prohibited.

In\nElrod, a plurality of the Court first announced this rule\nbased on the recognition that political patronage dismissals\nrun counter to the First Amendment rights of free speech\nand political association. See Elrod, 427 U.S. at 359. At the\nsame time, the Court delineated a narrowly drawn\nexception for particular positions for which political\naffiliation is found to be an appropriate requirement.\nApplying the intermediate \"exacting\" level of scrutiny, the\nCourt explained: \"The interest advanced must be\nparamount, one of vital importance, and the burden is on\nthe government to show the existence of such an interest.\"\nId. at 362; see Boyle v. County of Allegheny Pennsylvania,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752434\"><a href=\"/opinion/752434/patrick-j-boyle-v-county-of-allegheny-pennsylvania-larry-dunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395 (3d Cir. 1998). The notion of what\nconstitutes a position for which political affiliation may\nacceptably be required has developed over time. In Elrod,\nthe Court adopted an approach that distinguished between\npolicymaking and non-policymaking positions. Reiterating\nthe rule in his concurrence, Justice Stewart advised that\npolitical affiliation could not provide a basis for adverse\nactions taken against a \"nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential\ngovernment employee\". Id. at 375 (Stewart, J., concurring).\nThe Court described the inquiry into the nature of the\nresponsibilities and the function of a given position as\nparticularly fact-specific. Id. at 367-68.\n\n                               17\n\fIn Branti, the Court revised the Elrod test to lessen the\nemphasis on determinations of whether a position entails\npolicymaking and confidentiality: \"the ultimate inquiry is\nnot whether the label `policymaker' or `confidential' fits a\nparticular position; rather, the question is whether the\nhiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an\nappropriate requirement for the effective performance of the\npublic office involved.\" Branti, 445 U.S. at 518. Justice\nStevens, speaking for the Court, stated: \"Under some\ncircumstances, a position may be appropriately considered\npolitical even though it is neither confidential nor\npolicymaking in character.\" Id. at 518 (providing an\nexample of a scenario in which \"a State's election laws\nrequire that precincts be supervised by two election judges\nof different parties\"). He continued: \"It is equally clear that\nparty affiliation is not necessarily relevant to every\npolicymaking or confidential position.\" Id. (giving the\nexample of a football coach for a state university).\n\n       On the other hand, it is equally clear that the Governor\n       of a State may appropriately believe that the official\n       duties of various assistants who help him write\n       speeches, explain his views to the press, or\n       communicate with the legislature cannot be performed\n       effectively unless those persons share his political\n       beliefs and party commitments.\n\nId. The Branti Court also reiterated that in order for a\npatronage dismissal to pass constitutional muster, it must\nforward a governmental purpose:\n\n       The plurality [in Elrod] emphasized that patronage\n       dismissals could be justified only if they advanced a\n       governmental, rather than a partisan, interest. 427\n       U.S., at 362. That standard clearly was not met to the\n       extent that employees were expected to perform\n       extracurricular activities for the party, or were being\n       rewarded for past services to the party. Government\n       funds, which are collected from taxpayers of all parties\n       on a nonpolitical basis, cannot be expended for the\n       benefit of one political party simply because that party\n       has control of the government.\n\nBranti, 445 U.S. at 517 n.12. The requirement of a\ngovernmental purpose to support political patronage\n\n                                18\n\freflects the core holding of Elrod and Branti that a long\ntradition of political patronage cannot, in itself, immunize\npolitically motivated dismissals from scrutiny.\n\nWe have had numerous occasions to apply these\nprinciples. In Boyle v. County of Allegheny Pennsylvania,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752434\"><a href=\"/opinion/752434/patrick-j-boyle-v-county-of-allegheny-pennsylvania-larry-dunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1998), we charted the development of\nThird Circuit case law interpreting the Elrod /Branti test.\nThe Boyle court canvassed Ness v.

In the case at bar, we must determine\nwhether the District Court's grant of summary judgment\nwas correct as to the appellant--a nonpolicymaking,\nsecretary-clerk serving in roughly equal parts an elective\ncounty executive (County Commissioner) and a non-elective\ncounty administrator (Chief Clerk). Unsurprisingly, none of\nour prior cases carries us effortlessly to a resolution;\nhowever, we find particular guidance in Brown and Zold.\n\nBrown arose from the dismissal of a county assistant\ndirector of public information. In that case, we discussed\nthe difficulty of determining the appropriateness of political-\naffiliation requirements for jobs that entail clerical tasks:\n\n       While Branti provides us with a \"test\" the Supreme\n       Court has not specified the particular factors which\n       indicate that a position falls within the Branti test.\n       Factors suggested by other courts include whether the\n\n                               19\n\f       employee's duties are simply clerical or related to law\n       enforcement, nondiscretionary or technical. Courts\n       have also considered whether the employee participates\n       in Council discussions or other meetings, whether the\n       employee prepares budgets, or has authority to hire or\n       fire employees, the salary of the employee, and the\n       employee's power to control others and to speak in the\n       name of policymakers. In Crisp [v. Bond, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2010047\"><a href=\"/opinion/2010047/crisp-v-bond/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n       <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139 (W.D. Mo. 1982)], the Court held that the\n       Assistant Director of the Division of Motor Vehicle and\n       Drivers Licensing could not be fired because he had no\n       confidential duties even though he supervised\n       employees, prepared the budget, was liaison with the\n       public, attended conferences, and analyzed\n       administrative procedures and work standards. The\n       key factor seems to be not whether the employee was\n       a supervisor or had a great deal of responsibility but\n       whether the employee has \"meaningful input into\n       decision making concerning the nature and scope of a\n       major township program.\"\n\nBrown, 787 F.2d at 169-70 (citations omitted). In Brown,\nwe concluded: \"While some of [Brown's] duties were only\ntechnical or clerical in nature, her principal duty was to act\nas spokesman for the Commissioners and help promote\ncounty projects. Brown could, therefore, be dismissed\nbecause of her political affiliation without any violation of\nher first amendment rights.\" Id. at 170.\n\nIn Zold, a deputy township clerk challenged her politically\nmotivated dismissal. We reversed the district court's grant\nof summary judgment in favor of the township and\nremanded the case for further proceedings. We observed\nthat the district court appeared to rely on three job\nfunctions in finding that political affiliation was a proper\njob requirement for the deputy clerk position: (1) secretary\nof the Township Committee, in which capacity the deputy\nclerk could have access to confidential information during\nclosed sessions; (2) liaison officer between government\nofficials and taxpayers and between the executive and the\ngeneral body of municipal personnel; and (3) public\nrelations figure. See Zold, 935 F.2d at 637. We\ndistinguished the public relations work performed by Zold\n\n                               20\n\ffrom that conducted by the appellant in Brown based on\nthe fact that Zold was not responsible for writing press\nreleases and speeches of elected officials, or for promoting\ncounty projects, or for acting as spokesperson for the\ncounty commissioners before the press and public. See id.\nat 638. Instead, we reasoned:\n\n       Her contact with the press is generally limited to\n       informing reporters about the agenda of upcoming\n       meetings, and her contact with the public is, as the\n       district court put it, \"receiving inquiries and complaints\n       from the electorate and responding in kind,\" 737\n       F.Supp. at 317, rather than promoting policies.\n       Therefore, Brown does not provide a basis to conclude\n       that the deputy clerk's political affiliation is a job\n       requirement.\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\nAdditionally, we found that the deputy clerk's access to\nconfidential material did not justify a political affiliation job\nrequirement; however this holding was narrowly tailored to\nthe circumstances of Zold:\n\n       Arguably, even though there is no evidence that the\n       clerk or the deputy clerk acts as anything other than a\n       functionary during the closed Committee meetings, the\n       access to confidential information which may be\n       discussed on these occasions might signify that\n       political affiliation, translated in this case into loyalty\n       to the majority party, is a job requirement. Nor do we\n       deny that there is some sensitivity and discretion\n       which must be exercised when the deputy clerk is\n       acting as a liaison or as a spokesman. However, these\n       factors cannot serve to demonstrate the need for party\n       affiliation because virtually all of these functions are\n       duties that the deputy assumes from the clerk. State\n       law makes clear that political affiliation is not a factor\n       in the municipal clerk's position.\n\nId. at 638. Hence, we stated that \"we cannot conclude that\nduties fulfilled by a tenured, nonpolitical appointee\nsuddenly become confidential or political on those\noccasions when the deputy clerk is called to substitute for\nhim.\" Id.\n\n                               21\n\fFinally, we observed:\n\n       The defendants have expressed concern that an\n       employee whose tasks include contact with the public\n       could deliberately harm the government's (and thereby\n       the dominant party's) image in the public eye; one who\n       must provide information to government officials\n       perhaps could deliberately undermine policy decisions\n       or administrative efficacy. However, any government\n       employee, including those with the most routine\n       clerical tasks, could injure the employer's efficiency or\n       public image. A receptionist could put callers on hold\n       and neglect to answer or forward their inquiries; an\n       office clerk could misfile forms, deliberately delay their\n       processing, and treat visitors rudely. The obvious\n       response is that employees who engage in such\n       behavior can be discharged on the basis of their poor\n       job performance. The potential that an employee may\n       cause havoc is in itself no basis for holding the\n       employee can be hired or discharged because of his or\n       her political affiliation.\n\nId. at 639.\n\nIn the present case, the District Court found, at the close\nof discovery, that there were no remaining material issues\nof fact as to whether political affiliation was an appropriate\nrequirement for Armour's position. As we explain in the\nparagraphs which follow, our review of the record yields a\ndifferent conclusion.\n\nWe highlight certain factual disputes that we find\nunsusceptible to resolution at the summary judgment\nstage. First, we note that the District Court undertook to\nweigh the credibility and relative significance of Armour's\nMarch 11, 1998 written comments about her job\ndescription and her subsequent deposition testimony on\nthe subject. Specifically, the District Court characterized\nArmour's deposition testimony as \"contradictory and her\nunbiased statement regarding her job duties as provided in\nMarch 1998 as more significant.\" We think such weighing\nshould have been reserved for the fact-finder.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The District Court relied on Martin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508744\"><a href=\"/opinion/508744/theodora-hope-martin-an-individual-william-martin-an-individual-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1988) as support for its authority to assess\n\n                               22\n\fIn the same vein, we do not agree with the District Court\nthat Clarke's testimony that she \"represented\" Donatella\nsupports summary judgment. The theme of representation\nwas addressed in the testimony of a number of witnesses;\nhowever, the content of the testimony on the concept of\nrepresentation of the commissioners is less than clear.\nWhereas Clarke testified that she \"represented\" Donatella at\npolitical events, a reasonable fact-finder might conclude\nthat the representation of which she spoke entailed little\nmore than her presence at certain events rather than active\nparticipation as a spokesperson (\"I go just to represent him,\nbe present\"). For her part, Armour testified that it was not\npart of her job to represent Schulte at political events.\nArmour's role at the AFPN meetings--she attended in\nSchulte's stead but Schulte only became aware that\nArmour voted at the meetings after the fact--might also be\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nthe credibility of the later deposition testimony.

Later, facing an almost certain\n       loss on summary judgment, she submitted a flatly contradictory\n       affidavit which contained no explanation for her change in\nposition.\n       We held that on those clear and extreme facts the district court\n       could properly ignore the later affidavit.\n\nVideon Chevrolet, Inc., 992 F.2d at 488.

A fact-finder might not only\nhave accepted the explanation but gone on to credit the deposition\ntestimony of appellant that the District Court declined to give equivalent\nweight to.\n\n                               23\n\finterpreted to support more than one inference regarding\nthe level of representation inherent in the position.\n\nFurther, Armour contends that the fact that the\ncommissioners created a new administrative position above\nthe secretaries, though they never filled that position,\nwould lend support to a finding that the secretarial\npositions did not entail the level of confidentiality or require\nthe type of representation of the commissioners that would\nmake political affiliation a proper job requirement.\nSpecifically, Schulte testified that the never-filled executive\nadministrator position required a college degree because\nthe person in that position \"would, indeed, be representing\nthe three commissioners.\" Of course, the fact that the\nadministrative position was created would not compel a\nfact-finder to conclude that the work of the secretaries and\nthe work of the potential administrator would not have\noverlapped in any respect. However, the creation of the\nadministrative position and the adoption of more\ndemanding requirements for it than for a secretarial\nposition might lead a fact-finder to doubt that a secretarial\nposition was one for which political affiliation was a proper\ningredient.\n\nFinally, we note that the secretaries' contact with\nconstituents, relied on by the District Court in its summary\njudgment ruling, also fails to bear the weight of the\ngovernment's burden on the appropriateness of a political-\naffiliation requirement. It is undisputed that Armour and\nthe other secretaries responded to constituent calls\nand, when possible, handled constituents' requests\nwithout involving the commissioners. We are, however,\nunpersuaded that the fact that the secretaries would\nattempt to handle constituents' requests on their own\nineluctably leads to the conclusion that political affiliation\nwas an appropriate requirement for the job. See Zold, 935\nF.2d at 638 (employee's contact with the public limited to\nreceiving and responding to inquiries and complaints rather\nthan promoting policies did not support a political-\naffiliation requirement).\n\nNeither the County nor Schulte contends that this case\nimplicates the central question in most political patronage\ncases--whether an employee had \"meaningful input into\n\n                               24\n\fdecision making.\" Brown, 787 F.2d at 170. Instead,\nappellees rely on evidence that Armour was entrusted with\naccess to confidential information as part of her job and\nthat a lack of political loyalty would interfere with the\nperformance of her duties. We have, indeed, acknowledged\nthat access to confidential information may support a\npolitical-affiliation job requirement even in the absence of a\ndecision-making function. See Zold, 935 F.2d at 638-39.\nHowever, we have also cautioned against an over reliance\non the factors of confidentiality and loyalty: \"Although\nloyalty and confidentiality of sheriff's deputies are desirable\nattributes, those traits are needed for many working\nrelationships. It has never been suggested that the need for\nloyalty and confidentiality alone supports politically\nmotivated dismissals independent of the tasks which the\nemployee must perform.\" Burns v.

Here we are faced with the question whether being\nthe personal secretary to a county commissioner is, without\nmore, sufficient evidence to establish as a matter of law\nthat political affiliation is an appropriate job requirement.\nThere is case law that points in this direction. For example,\nin Faughender v. City of North Olmsted, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557236\"><a href=\"/opinion/557236/barbara-faughender-v-city-of-north-olmsted-ohio-and-m-yvonne-petragic/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 914\n(6th Cir. 1991), the Sixth Circuit stated: \"Viewed in its\nfunctional aspect, a mayor's secretary is clearly the type of\nposition that involves access to confidential and political\nmaterial, and political loyalty, whether partisan or personal,\nis an essential attribute of the job.\" But the fact-specific\napproach embraced by this court in Brown and Zold and\nother cases is not in harmony with such a categorical rule.\n\nArmour's \"access to confidential information . . . might\nsignify that political affiliation . . . is a job requirement.\"\nZold, 935 F.2d at 638. However, on the record before us, we\nare unable to so conclude without weighing the evidence--a\ntask that we leave for the fact-finder. If a jury were to credit\nArmour's testimony, and indeed a good deal of the\ntestimony of Donatella and Johnson, it could find that the\njob duties of the commissioner's secretary were more\nanalogous to \"the most routine clerical tasks,\" id. at 639,\nthan to tasks involving a high level of confidentiality.\n\nThus, based on our review of the record, we conclude\n\n                               25\n\fthat, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), genuine disputes\nregarding the nature of Armour's position remain. This\nconclusion is strengthened in that, as mentioned above, the\n\"substantial\" burden of proving that political affiliation is\nan appropriate job requirement remains at all times on the\ngovernmental entity or official seeking to justify the adverse\nemployment action. See Burns, 971 F.2d at 1022.6\n\nB. The Sua Sponte Ruling That Armo ur Was Not Fired\nfor Political Reasons\n\nWe turn now to the District Court's alternative basis for\ngranting summary judgment--namely, that Armour failed\nto come forward with evidence linking her termination to\nher perceived political affiliation.\n\nIn order to prevail on a First Amendment claim of\ndiscrimination, a public employee must prove \"that the\nemployee's political affiliation was a substantial or\nmotivating factor in the adverse employment decision.\"\nRobertson v.

Boyle, 139 F.3d at 397; Ness, 660 F.2d at 522.\nThis is such a case.\"\n\nNess is authority for the proposition that\"[w]here, as a matter of law,\na person is determined to have occupied a policymaking position, that\nperson's claims to protection from patronage dismissal under Elrod and\nBranti are disposable on a motion for summary judgment.\" Id. What was\nsaid in Ness must, of course, be read in the context of the Supreme\nCourt's recital in Branti \"that party affiliation is not necessarily\nrelevant\nto every policymaking or confidential position.\" 445 U.S. at 518. We do\nnot understand the dissent to contend that Armour's position could\nproperly be characterized as \"policymaking.\" On the other hand, there is\ncertainly evidence of record that some of Armour's responsibilities were\n\"confidential.\" However, the record does not compel the inference that, as\na matter of law, the totality, or even the bulk, of Armour's\nresponsibilities were \"confidential.\" Accordingly, determining whether the\ndefendants, on whom the burden rests, have been able to establish that\nArmour's job falls outside the protections of Elrod and Branti is a matter\nfor the factfinder, not for the District Court on summary judgment. As\nwe noted in Boyle, \"at the summary judgment stage, a court may not\nweigh the evidence or make credibility determinations; these tasks are\nleft to the factfinder.\" 139 F.3d at 393.\n\n                               26\n\fcase, appellees had submitted a summary judgment motion\nto the District Court that was directed at the\nappropriateness of requiring political affiliation in the\nsecretarial position. In that summary judgment motion\nappellees acknowledged that the issue of whether Armour's\nfiring was politically motivated \"involve[s] disputes over\nissues of material fact best left for trial.\" Nevertheless, when\nruling on the parties' motions, the District Court sua sponte\naddressed the issue of why Armour was fired.\n\nWe need not reach the merits of the District Court's sua\nsponte disposition of the causation issue because the\nDistrict Court did not, prior to its ruling, notify the parties\nthat the issue would be addressed.

But the testimony\nunmistakably demonstrated more than Armour's access to\nconfidential information. It also proved that Armour\nperformed administrative and political tasks requiring\ndiscretion and judgment. Armour served as Schulte's\nprivate secretary and administrative assistant from January\n1996 through February 1999. During that period, she\nattended meetings of the Aliquippa Family Preservation\nNetwork on Schulte's behalf, sometimes voting her proxy.\nWhenever possible, Armour answered constituents'\nrequests herself. Armour also attended political functions\nand fundraisers with Schulte, testifying these events were\ndesigned \"to get [Schulte's] name out.\" Furthermore,\nArmour acted as the liaison between Schulte and\ndepartment heads. Admitting that her duties required\npolitical acumen, Armour testified \"[t]he high level of\nconfidentiality and responsibility reaches far beyond the\ndesk, often into our personal lives.\" Armour also conceded\nthat political affiliation was an appropriate requirement for\nher position and that she would never have been hired had\nshe not actively supported Schulte's 1996 successful\ncampaign for office.3 As the District Court noted:\n\n       Each time [Armour] responded to a concern of a\n       constituent, she was representing Schulte in a political\n       nature. It is likely that Democratic constituents who\n       seek redress from their Democratic commissioner, or\n       simply express concerns of a political nature, expect\n       that the commissioner's secretary shares their political\n       ideology. In other words, Democratic constituents\n       should find comfort in expressing their concerns to the\n       commissioner's secretary, whom the voters felt would\n       express or relay the issues accurately and\n       compassionately to the commissioner.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Armour became involved in Schulte's campaign for county\ncommissioner when Schulte's husband, a Pennsylvania district justice,\nasked Armour to assist his wife. Armour testified she did \"[w]hatever was\nasked\" in the campaign, including attending organizational meetings and\nfunctions, driving Schulte to the polling places, and posting Schulte's\nsigns throughout the county. After Schulte's election, the commissioner-\nelect asked Armour to serve as her secretary, which Armour immediately\naccepted. Armour began working the day Schulte took her oath of office.\n\n                               30\n\fOpinion at 11-12.\n\nIn addition to this evidence, the District Court considered\ntestimony from others regarding the role of commissioners'\nsecretaries. Beaver County Commissioner Dan Donatella\ndeclared his secretary \"operates as his eyes and ears, both\npolitically and otherwise.\" Jo Johnson, secretary to Beaver\nCounty Commissioner Nancy Loxley, testified her position\nrequired political loyalty because Loxley discussed in\nconfidence political as well as party issues. Both Johnson\nand Joan Clarke, secretary to Commissioner Donatella,\ndescribed their jobs as \"political.\" Clarke testified that she\nrepresented Commissioner Donatella \"when I am anywhere\npolitically.\"\n\nIn light of their duties, the Beaver County\nCommissioners' secretaries functioned as political and\ngovernmental assistants. Cf. Branti, 445 U.S. at 517. Other\nCourts of Appeals have repeatedly concluded policymakers'\nassistants' jobs are not protected by the First Amendment.4\nThe District Court correctly reached the same result in this\ncase.\n\nArmour's duties were constitutionally indistinguishable\nfrom those of a mayor's secretary. As the Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit held, \"Viewed in its functional aspect,\na mayor's secretary is clearly the type of position that\ninvolves access to confidential and political material, and\npolitical loyalty . . . is an essential attribute of the job.\"\nFaughender, 927 F.2d at 914.

Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n150 (2000). Nor do I find \"reasonable\" an inference that\nArmour's duties were primarily clerical. An officeholder's\n\"clerical\" employees do not vote her proxies, resolve\nconstituents' requests, or have access to the office's most\nsensitive and confidential political and governmental\ninformation, as did Armour. The District Court held,\"In\nessence, plaintiff was a conduit between the Democratic\nconstituents and Commissioner Schulte, their elected\nrepresentative.\" Opinion at 12.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. As noted in Faughender, \"A mayor's secretary must undertake those\nfunctions in relation to the flow of information, whether by writing,\nspeech, or personal visit, to and from the mayor's office, that the mayor\nwants the secretary to perform. A particular secretary's duties may be\ncircumscribed, but the function of the office is constant.\" 927 F.2d at\n913-14.\n\n                                32\n\f6. I would also affirm the District Court's alternative holding -- that\nArmour did not demonstrate her support of Joseph Askar for a local\njudgeship was a \"substantial or motivating factor\" in her termination.\nOpinion at 12-14. The evidence demonstrated Schulte only questioned\nArmour once about her involvement with Askar, and Armour denied any\n\"direct\" involvement with Askar's campaign. With no other evidentiary\nsupport, Armour did not meet her burden of proving that her political\naffiliations led to her dismissal.\nThe majority frames the issue as whether summary\njudgment was appropriate, given Armour was a\n\"nonpolicymaking, secretary-clerk serving in roughly equal\nparts an elective county executive (County Commissioner)\nand a non-elective county administrator (Chief Clerk).\"\nSupra at 19. I do not read the court's opinion as an attempt\nto segregate Armour's duties between the \"political\" and the\n\"nonpolitical.\" Of course, were that the standard, \"political\"\nemployees in state or municipal government would be\nvirtually nonexistent. Necessity demands the staffs of\nelected officials perform several tasks -- governmental,\npolitical, administrative, and clerical. Clerical duties, even if\nthey are \"roughly equal\" to more specialized obligations, do\nnot render those employees \"nonpolitical.\"\n\nThe District Court found that an \"absence of political\ncohesion\" between Armour and Schulte would potentially\ndamage the commissioner's work, rendering Armour an\nemployee subject to dismissal on political grounds. Opinion\nat 12, quoted supra at 14-16. Having reviewed the record,\nI would agree.6\n\nBecause I would affirm the judgment of the District\nCourt, I respectfully dissent.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               33\n\f</pre>",
