Bailey and Kenneth D. Carden. For the reasons set out\nbelow, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n        *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f   Case: 11-10830   Document: 00511886383     Page: 2   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                 No. 11-10830\n\n           I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      Plaintiff–Appellant Leslie Greer sued Defendant–Appellee Richardson\nIndependent School District (“RISD”), alleging violations of Title II of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794 and 794a. Greer’s claims related to\nRISD’s Berkner B stadium, located at Berkner High School in Richardson,\nTexas. Greer, who uses a wheelchair because of a spinal cord injury she\nsuffered, attended her son’s junior varsity football game at the Berkner B\nstadium on October 4, 2007. She was unable to sit in the bleachers because they\ncould only be reached by climbing a flight of stairs. Consequently, she watched\nthe game from a paved area adjacent to the bleachers, where she estimated she\ncould only observe roughly 15% of the game because her view was obstructed.\nGreer’s initial complaint focused exclusively on her exclusion from the stadium’s\nbleacher seating.\n      The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in December 2008.\nAt a motion hearing on March 4, 2009, the district court granted leave for RISD\nto amend its answer to assert the affirmative defense that making accessibility\nmodifications to the Berkner B stadium would impose an undue financial and\nadministrative burden. The court also reopened discovery as to RISD’s newly\nasserted defense. On July 9, 2009, the district court granted Greer leave to file\na Second Amended Complaint, in which Greer added accessibility allegations\nrelated to the restrooms in Berkner B stadium, curb cuts, ramp access to a public\nright of way, and access to the track surrounding the football field. RISD filed\nits Third Amended Answer on July 17, 2009.\n      On August 3, 2009, both parties again filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment. Greer also filed a motion to extend discovery and to allow subsequent\nbriefing on RISD’s undue burden defense, and the district court granted this\nmotion. On February 1, 2010, the parties filed their third cross-motions for\n\n                                       2\n\f   Case: 11-10830    Document: 00511886383      Page: 3   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-10830\n\nsummary judgment. Greer subsequently filed a Motion to Strike Undue Burden\nDefense and for Sanctions, asserting that RISD had asserted the undue burden\ndefense in bad faith and that RISD did not have the requisite factual basis for\nthe defense under 28 C.F.R. § 350.150(a)(3).\n      On August 2, 2010, the district court granted RISD’s motion for summary\njudgment in part, holding that Greer did not present a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination under Section II of the ADA. Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch.\nDist., 752 F. Supp. 2d 746, 754–56 (N.D. Tex. 2010). The district court also\ngranted summary judgment in part to Greer based on her allegation that a ramp\ninstalled at the stadium did not comply with ADA Accessibility Guidelines for\nBuildings and Facilities (“ADAAG”) requirements and denied Greer’s Motion to\nStrike Undue Burden Defense and for Sanctions. Id. at 758.\n      On August 20, 2010, Greer filed a Motion for Findings of Fact on Plaintiff’s\nMotion to Strike Undue Burden Defense and for Sanctions, requesting that the\ndistrict court explain its denial of her motion. The district court issued an order\non August 27, 2010, concluding, inter alia, that “Defendant’s undue burden\ndefense was not asserted in bad faith” and stating that the court allowed RISD\nto amend its answer to assert the defense “in light of the scattershot allegations\nPlaintiff pled in her Complaint.” The court further noted that “it would waste\njudicial resources for the Court to further evaluate the moot defense of undue\nburden.”\n      On November 12, 2010, the district court disposed of all pending motions\nand claims in favor of RISD. Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist., 752 F. Supp.\n2d 759, 762–63 (N.D. Tex. 2010). On December 7, 2010, the district court taxed\ncosts in the amount of $5,254.25 against Greer under 28 U.S.C. § 1920. Greer\nfiled a Motion to Deny Costs on December 14, 2010, seeking to deny the costs of\ndepositions allegedly taken in connection with RISD’s undue burden defense.\nOn April 12, 2011, the district court denied Greer’s motion.\n\n                                        3\n\f   Case: 11-10830      Document: 00511886383         Page: 4     Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-10830\n\n       On November 24, 2010, RISD moved for attorneys’ fees pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 and 28 U.S.C. § 1927, and it filed an\nAmended Motion for Attorney Fees on February 17, 2011. RISD sought the\nrecovery of fees incurred as a result of the alleged vexatious and unreasonable\nconduct by Plaintiff’s counsel in its Third Motion for Summary Judgment,\nResponse to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Motion to Strike\nUndue Burden Defense and for Sanctions, Request for Findings of Fact on\nUndue Burden Defense, and Motion to Deny Costs. RISD also sought recovery\nof attorneys’ fees incurred in preparing and filing its Motion for Attorney Fees.\nThe magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant RISD’s motion\nand award attorneys’ fees under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 in the amount of $34,958, and\nparalegal fees in the amount of $5,572.50, payable jointly and severally by\nGreer’s counsel, Palmer D. Bailey and Kenneth D. Carden. On August 11, 2011,\nthe district court awarded RISD $25,723 in attorneys’ fees and $2,162.50 in\nparalegal fees, accepting the findings and conclusions of the magistrate judge in\npart, but declining to award fees related to Greer’s Request for Findings of Fact\non Undue Burden Defense and RISD’s Motion for Attorney Fees. Greer timely\nappealed.1\n                                   II. DISCUSSION\n       Under 28 U.S.C. § 1927, an “attorney . . . who so multiplies the\nproceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the\ncourt to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees\nreasonably incurred because of such conduct.” For an attorney’s conduct to be\nconsidered unreasonable and vexatious, “there be evidence of bad faith, improper\n\n\n\n       1\n        Greer separately appealed the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of\nRISD and its denial of her motion for sanctions, and this court affirmed the district court’s\njudgment. Greer v. Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 10–11254, 2012 WL 833367, at *1 (5th\nCir. Mar. 14, 2012).\n\n                                             4\n\f   Case: 11-10830       Document: 00511886383         Page: 5     Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-10830\n\nmotive, or reckless disregard of the duty owed to the court.” Edwards v. Gen.\nMotors Corp., 153 F.3d 242, 246 (5th Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). “We have\ncharacterized awards under § 1927 as penal in nature.” Browning v. Kramer,\n931 F.2d 340, 344 (5th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). “[I]n order not to dampen\nthe legitimate zeal of an attorney in representing his client, § 1927 is strictly\nconstrued.” Travelers Ins. Co. v. St. Jude Hosp. of Kenner, La., Inc., 38 F.3d\n1414, 1416 (5th Cir. 1994).\n       Despite our strict construction of § 1927, we review the district court’s\nimposition of attorneys’ fees for abuse of discretion. See id. at 1417. “A district\ncourt abuses its discretion if it awards sanctions based on an erroneous view of\nthe law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Walker v. City of\nBogalusa, 168 F.3d 237, 240 (5th Cir. 1999) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). “[I]n reviewing the imposition of sanctions, we do not substitute\nour judgment for that of the district court in enforcing acceptable standards of\nconduct.” Travelers Ins. Co., 38 F.3d at 1417 (citation omitted). “The district\ncourt is in the best position to assess the propriety of a party’s conduct.”\nMeadowbriar Home for Children, Inc. v. Gunn, 81 F.3d 521, 535 (5th Cir. 1996)\n(citation omitted).       Nonetheless, the district “court must announce the\nsanctionable conduct giving rise to its order.” Topalian v. Ehrman, 3 F.3d 931,\n937 (5th Cir. 1993). “Specific findings permit effective appellate review of the\nvalidity and amount of fees.” Procter & Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., 280 F.3d\n519, 526 (5th Cir. 2002).\n       Greer’s attorneys contend that there was never a finding of bad faith,\nimproper motive, or reckless disregard of the duty owed to the court.2 Her\n\n\n       2\n        Greer’s counsel also complains that the district court did not hold a hearing prior to\nimposing sanctions. However, the magistrate judge noted that neither party requested a\nhearing and found that a hearing was not needed to clarify the § 1927 issues. We have upheld\nthe imposition of sanctions imposed without a hearing under similar circumstances. See\nTravelers Ins. Co., 38 F.3d at 1418.\n\n                                              5\n\f   Case: 11-10830          Document: 00511886383      Page: 6     Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                           No. 11-10830\n\ncounsel asserts that it “was, in effect, sanctioned for the manner in which it\nargued its summary judgment briefs and the language and arguments it made.”\nGreer’s attorneys stress that, in recommending that the district court award\nattorneys’ fees to RISD, the magistrate judge highlighted statements the district\ncourt made regarding the “paucity of citations” in Greer’s lengthy summary\njudgment briefing, the “use of informal language that seesaws between flippancy\nand condescension,” and the court’s observation that the brief was “obviously not\nproofread.”3 According to Greer’s counsel, such statements cannot be the basis\nfor imposing sanctions under § 1927 because “sanctions may not be imposed for\nmere negligence on the part of counsel.”4 Baulch v. Johns, 70 F.3d 813, 817 (5th\nCir. 1995). However, the magistrate judge in this case found that the manner\nin which Greer’s counsel asserted its arguments reflected a reckless disregard\nfor its duty to the court. Further, “[w]e have in the past upheld awards based\nin part on ‘the irresponsible manner in which the litigation was conducted\n[which] further multiplied the[] . . . proceedings.’” Browning, 931 F.2d at 345\n(first alteration in original) (quoting Lewis v. Brown & Root, Inc., 711 F.2d 1287,\n1292 (5th Cir. 1983)).\n\n\n\n\n       3\n           In full, the district court stated:\n\n       The Court observes the paucity of citations to the law in the fifty pages of\n       Plaintiff’s summary judgment brief, and further notes with disapproval the use\n       of informal language that seesaws between flippancy and condescension.\n       Sentences such as “Did you see that?” and “Think about it” are neither an\n       acceptable nor appropriate way to address the Court. See Plaintiff’s Brief in\n       Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at 9, 14. It is also highly\n       inappropriate for Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Carden, to have filed\n       a brief that was obviously not proofread and thus contains internal notations\n       to counsel such as “Cite case here.” Id. at 48.\n       4\n        In its briefing on appeal, Greer’s counsel similarly contends that it “is now being\nsanctioned under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 for being justly outraged at [RISD’s] conduct and for merely\nholding RISD’s conduct up for light-hearted ridicule.”\n\n                                                 6\n\f   Case: 11-10830    Document: 00511886383      Page: 7   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-10830\n\n      Moreover, Greer’s counsel fails to give weight to significant portions of the\nmagistrate judge’s findings and conclusions. The magistrate judge noted that\nthe district court had “thoroughly documented a number of the problems with\nPlaintiff’s counsel[’]s[] conduct in this case” and set out in detail additional\nconduct that it found to be unreasonable and vexatious, including the\nmischaracterization of witness testimony, the failure to cite the record\naccurately, and the persistent assertion of baseless arguments. These findings\nare examined below.\n      With regard to Greer’s Third Motion for Summary Judgment, the\nmagistrate judge detailed Greer’s counsel’s mischaracterization of witness\ntestimony, as well as the assertion of baseless arguments regarding the standard\nfor accessibility and unsupportable accusations against RISD and its counsel.\nIn particular, Greer’s counsel repeatedly argued that RISD’s expert witness,\nMichael Longanecker, testified that the Berkner B stadium was not accessible.\nHowever, the district court found that “[t]his characterization is misleading at\nworst; at best, it consistently confuses the different standards that apply to\nnew/altered and existing facilities.” The district court further noted that its\nreview of Greer’s Third Motion for Summary Judgment “as to the newly\nrenovated portions [of the Berkner B stadium] was severely hampered by Greer’s\nrepeated failures to accurately cite the record.” In recommending an award of\nattorneys’ fees, the magistrate judge found that “Defendant was required to\nexpend extensive attorney and paralegal time clarifying the record for the\nDistrict Court.”\n      The magistrate judge also concluded that the arguments Greer’s counsel\nasserted and reiterated regarding accessibility standards were baseless. Under\nTitle II of the ADA, “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of\nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\n\n                                        7\n\f   Case: 11-10830    Document: 00511886383       Page: 8   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-10830\n\ndiscrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. The accessibility\nrequirements for existing facilities, such as the Berkner B stadium, are more\nrelaxed under the ADA than those for new structures. See Tennessee v. Lane,\n541 U.S. 509, 531–32 (2004). “When considering ADA compliance for such\nexisting structures, the touchstone is . . . not the facility’s technical compliance\nwith the ADAAG, but is instead ‘program accessibility.’” Greer v. Richardson\nIndep. Sch. Dist., No. 10–11254, 2012 WL 833367, at *4 (5th Cir. Mar. 14, 2012).\nIn the case of existing facilities, a public entity must “operate each service,\nprogram, or activity so that the service, program, or activity, when viewed in its\nentirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.” 28\nC.F.R. § 35.150(a). Nonetheless, Greer “insist[ed] throughout the litigation to\napply a strict, technical definition of ‘accessible’ as defined in the ADAAG to\nmean compliance with the ADAAG standards.” Greer, 2012 WL 833367, at *5\nn.5. However, as this court found, Greer improperly “conflate[d] . . . facility\ndeviations from ADAAG standards, which are applicable to newly constructed\nor modified facilities, with RISD’s obligation to provide program access at an\nexisting facility” and, in effect, “attempt[ed] to completely nullify the ‘program\naccess’ standard.” Id. at *5. The magistrate judge in this case found that\nGreer’s argument regarding the standard for accessibility was “[w]ithout legal\nor factual justification.”\n      Not only did Greer’s counsel misstate the applicable legal standards for\naccessibility, it accused RISD of fabricating a new standard for accessibility and\nmisleading the court by using a definition of accessible that differed from that\nin the ADAAG. The district court, however, found that RISD had advanced the\ncorrect legal standard for assessing the accessibility of existing facilities, and in\nrecommending sanctions against Greer’s counsel, the magistrate judge\ncharacterized Greer’s accusations as “attempt[s] to misdirect the Court.”\nMoreover, Greer’s counsel’s arguments took a form that the magistrate judge\n\n                                         8\n\f   Case: 11-10830       Document: 00511886383         Page: 9     Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-10830\n\ncharacterized as “wrongful accusation[s]” and “attack[s],” including allegations\nthat RISD’s counsel had “misled th[e] court” and “wast[ed] literally hundreds\nand hundreds of hours of [Plaintiff’s counsel’s] legal time briefing this case in\norder to expose this complete fabrication about what [Defendant] means by\n‘accessible.’”\n       With regard to Greer’s Response to Defendant’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment, the magistrate judge found that Greer’s counsel continued to\nmischaracterize Longanecker’s testimony and to assert the baseless accusations\nagainst RISD regarding the proper standard for assessing accessibility. The\nmagistrate judge further noted that Greer’s counsel made additional\n“unprofessional and untrue claims” and mischaracterized the testimony of\nRISD’s employees regarding the planned expenditures of bond funds.\n       Regarding Greer’s Motion to Strike Undue Burden Defense and for\nSanctions, the magistrate judge concluded that this motion was both “frivolous\nand unwarranted.” Greer’s counsel had argued that RISD asserted its undue\nburden defense in bad faith and failed to produce any evidence supporting the\ndefense despite repeated discovery requests. However, as this court noted,\n“RISD provided substantial discovery materials related to the analyses the\nschool district performed when evaluating what modifications would be made to\nfacilities in the district and how budgetary funds would be allocated, by priority,\nto modification projects.” Greer, 2012 WL 833367, at *10. Moreover, both this\ncourt and the district court concluded that RISD had an evidentiary basis for its\nundue burden defense.5 See id.\n       After the district court explicitly found that RISD asserted its undue\nburden defense in good faith, Greer reiterated the argument that RISD was\n\n\n       5\n         Much of Greer’s counsel’s briefing on appeal merely reiterates the position that RISD\nhad no basis for asserting its undue burden defense—an argument repeatedly rejected by the\ndistrict court and rejected by this court as well.\n\n                                              9\n\f  Case: 11-10830    Document: 00511886383       Page: 10   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-10830\n\nasserting the defense in bad faith in her Motion to Deny Costs. In denying\nGreer’s motion, the district court noted its consistent rejection of Greer’s\narguments regarding RISD’s undue burden defense and stated that “Plaintiff\nhas not only failed to show good cause for the Court to deny costs . . . but she has\nalso brought a frivolous motion . . . [and] unreasonably multiplied the\nproceedings.”\n      In light of the magistrate judge’s findings described above and adopted by\nthe district court, as well as our review of the record and relevant pleadings, we\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding\nattorneys’ fees to RISD under § 1927. Greer’s counsel challenges the amount of\nthe fees awarded and contends that the district court did not properly limit the\naward to those fees caused by any vexatious and unreasonable conduct. The\nmagistrate judge found that RISD had incurred a total of $206,004.25 in\nattorneys’ fees and $29,355.00 in paralegal fees in defending against Greer’s\nclaims, amounts well in excess of those awarded. In addition, the magistrate\njudge expressly found that the fees sought by RISD were only the portion\nattributable the unreasonable and vexatious conduct of Greer’s counsel. We\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to\nsegregate fees further.\n                               III. CONCLUSION\n      For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district\ncourt. Costs shall be borne by Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\f",

R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f   Case: 11-10830   Document: 00511886383     Page: 2   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                 No. 11-10830\n\n           I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      Plaintiff–Appellant Leslie Greer sued Defendant–Appellee Richardson\nIndependent School District (“RISD”), alleging violations of Title II of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794 and 794a. Greer’s claims related to\nRISD’s Berkner B stadium, located at Berkner High School in Richardson,\nTexas. Greer, who uses a wheelchair because of a spinal cord injury she\nsuffered, attended her son’s junior varsity football game at the Berkner B\nstadium on October 4, 2007. She was unable to sit in the bleachers because they\ncould only be reached by climbing a flight of stairs. Consequently, she watched\nthe game from a paved area adjacent to the bleachers, where she estimated she\ncould only observe roughly 15% of the game because her view was obstructed.\nGreer’s initial complaint focused exclusively on her exclusion from the stadium’s\nbleacher seating.\n      The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in December 2008.\nAt a motion hearing on March 4, 2009, the district court granted leave for RISD\nto amend its answer to assert the affirmative defense that making accessibility\nmodifications to the Berkner B stadium would impose an undue financial and\nadministrative burden. The court also reopened discovery as to RISD’s newly\nasserted defense. On July 9, 2009, the district court granted Greer leave to file\na Second Amended Complaint, in which Greer added accessibility allegations\nrelated to the restrooms in Berkner B stadium, curb cuts, ramp access to a public\nright of way, and access to the track surrounding the football field. RISD filed\nits Third Amended Answer on July 17, 2009.\n      On August 3, 2009, both parties again filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment. Greer also filed a motion to extend discovery and to allow subsequent\nbriefing on RISD’s undue burden defense, and the district court granted this\nmotion. On February 1, 2010, the parties filed their third cross-motions for\n\n                                       2\n\f   Case: 11-10830    Document: 00511886383      Page: 3   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-10830\n\nsummary judgment. Greer subsequently filed a Motion to Strike Undue Burden\nDefense and for Sanctions, asserting that RISD had asserted the undue burden\ndefense in bad faith and that RISD did not have the requisite factual basis for\nthe defense under 28 C.F.R. § 350.150(a)(3).\n      On August 2, 2010, the district court granted RISD’s motion for summary\njudgment in part, holding that Greer did not present a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination under Section II of the ADA.

The district court also\ngranted summary judgment in part to Greer based on her allegation that a ramp\ninstalled at the stadium did not comply with ADA Accessibility Guidelines for\nBuildings and Facilities (“ADAAG”) requirements and denied Greer’s Motion to\nStrike Undue Burden Defense and for Sanctions. Id. at 758.\n      On August 20, 2010, Greer filed a Motion for Findings of Fact on Plaintiff’s\nMotion to Strike Undue Burden Defense and for Sanctions, requesting that the\ndistrict court explain its denial of her motion. The district court issued an order\non August 27, 2010, concluding, inter alia, that “Defendant’s undue burden\ndefense was not asserted in bad faith” and stating that the court allowed RISD\nto amend its answer to assert the defense “in light of the scattershot allegations\nPlaintiff pled in her Complaint.” The court further noted that “it would waste\njudicial resources for the Court to further evaluate the moot defense of undue\nburden.”\n      On November 12, 2010, the district court disposed of all pending motions\nand claims in favor of RISD.

On December 7, 2010, the district court taxed\ncosts in the amount of $5,254.25 against Greer under 28 U.S.C. § 1920. Greer\nfiled a Motion to Deny Costs on December 14, 2010, seeking to deny the costs of\ndepositions allegedly taken in connection with RISD’s undue burden defense.\nOn April 12, 2011, the district court denied Greer’s motion.\n\n                                        3\n\f   Case: 11-10830      Document: 00511886383         Page: 4     Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                      No. 11-10830\n\n       On November 24, 2010, RISD moved for attorneys’ fees pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 and 28 U.S.C. § 1927, and it filed an\nAmended Motion for Attorney Fees on February 17, 2011. RISD sought the\nrecovery of fees incurred as a result of the alleged vexatious and unreasonable\nconduct by Plaintiff’s counsel in its Third Motion for Summary Judgment,\nResponse to Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Motion to Strike\nUndue Burden Defense and for Sanctions, Request for Findings of Fact on\nUndue Burden Defense, and Motion to Deny Costs. RISD also sought recovery\nof attorneys’ fees incurred in preparing and filing its Motion for Attorney Fees.\nThe magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant RISD’s motion\nand award attorneys’ fees under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 in the amount of $34,958, and\nparalegal fees in the amount of $5,572.50, payable jointly and severally by\nGreer’s counsel, Palmer D. Bailey and Kenneth D. Carden. On August 11, 2011,\nthe district court awarded RISD $25,723 in attorneys’ fees and $2,162.50 in\nparalegal fees, accepting the findings and conclusions of the magistrate judge in\npart, but declining to award fees related to Greer’s Request for Findings of Fact\non Undue Burden Defense and RISD’s Motion for Attorney Fees.

See Plaintiff’s Brief in\n       Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at 9, 14. It is also highly\n       inappropriate for Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Carden, to have filed\n       a brief that was obviously not proofread and thus contains internal notations\n       to counsel such as “Cite case here.” Id. at 48.\n       4\n        In its briefing on appeal, Greer’s counsel similarly contends that it “is now being\nsanctioned under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 for being justly outraged at [RISD’s] conduct and for merely\nholding RISD’s conduct up for light-hearted ridicule.”\n\n                                                 6\n\f   Case: 11-10830    Document: 00511886383      Page: 7   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-10830\n\n      Moreover, Greer’s counsel fails to give weight to significant portions of the\nmagistrate judge’s findings and conclusions. The magistrate judge noted that\nthe district court had “thoroughly documented a number of the problems with\nPlaintiff’s counsel[’]s[] conduct in this case” and set out in detail additional\nconduct that it found to be unreasonable and vexatious, including the\nmischaracterization of witness testimony, the failure to cite the record\naccurately, and the persistent assertion of baseless arguments. These findings\nare examined below.\n      With regard to Greer’s Third Motion for Summary Judgment, the\nmagistrate judge detailed Greer’s counsel’s mischaracterization of witness\ntestimony, as well as the assertion of baseless arguments regarding the standard\nfor accessibility and unsupportable accusations against RISD and its counsel.\nIn particular, Greer’s counsel repeatedly argued that RISD’s expert witness,\nMichael Longanecker, testified that the Berkner B stadium was not accessible.\nHowever, the district court found that “[t]his characterization is misleading at\nworst; at best, it consistently confuses the different standards that apply to\nnew/altered and existing facilities.” The district court further noted that its\nreview of Greer’s Third Motion for Summary Judgment “as to the newly\nrenovated portions [of the Berkner B stadium] was severely hampered by Greer’s\nrepeated failures to accurately cite the record.” In recommending an award of\nattorneys’ fees, the magistrate judge found that “Defendant was required to\nexpend extensive attorney and paralegal time clarifying the record for the\nDistrict Court.”\n      The magistrate judge also concluded that the arguments Greer’s counsel\nasserted and reiterated regarding accessibility standards were baseless. Under\nTitle II of the ADA, “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of\nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\n\n                                        7\n\f   Case: 11-10830    Document: 00511886383       Page: 8   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                   No. 11-10830\n\ndiscrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. The accessibility\nrequirements for existing facilities, such as the Berkner B stadium, are more\nrelaxed under the ADA than those for new structures. See Tennessee v.

However, as this court found, Greer improperly “conflate[d] . . . facility\ndeviations from ADAAG standards, which are applicable to newly constructed\nor modified facilities, with RISD’s obligation to provide program access at an\nexisting facility” and, in effect, “attempt[ed] to completely nullify the ‘program\naccess’ standard.” Id. at *5. The magistrate judge in this case found that\nGreer’s argument regarding the standard for accessibility was “[w]ithout legal\nor factual justification.”\n      Not only did Greer’s counsel misstate the applicable legal standards for\naccessibility, it accused RISD of fabricating a new standard for accessibility and\nmisleading the court by using a definition of accessible that differed from that\nin the ADAAG. The district court, however, found that RISD had advanced the\ncorrect legal standard for assessing the accessibility of existing facilities, and in\nrecommending sanctions against Greer’s counsel, the magistrate judge\ncharacterized Greer’s accusations as “attempt[s] to misdirect the Court.”\nMoreover, Greer’s counsel’s arguments took a form that the magistrate judge\n\n                                         8\n\f   Case: 11-10830       Document: 00511886383         Page: 9     Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                       No. 11-10830\n\ncharacterized as “wrongful accusation[s]” and “attack[s],” including allegations\nthat RISD’s counsel had “misled th[e] court” and “wast[ed] literally hundreds\nand hundreds of hours of [Plaintiff’s counsel’s] legal time briefing this case in\norder to expose this complete fabrication about what [Defendant] means by\n‘accessible.’”\n       With regard to Greer’s Response to Defendant’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment, the magistrate judge found that Greer’s counsel continued to\nmischaracterize Longanecker’s testimony and to assert the baseless accusations\nagainst RISD regarding the proper standard for assessing accessibility. The\nmagistrate judge further noted that Greer’s counsel made additional\n“unprofessional and untrue claims” and mischaracterized the testimony of\nRISD’s employees regarding the planned expenditures of bond funds.\n       Regarding Greer’s Motion to Strike Undue Burden Defense and for\nSanctions, the magistrate judge concluded that this motion was both “frivolous\nand unwarranted.” Greer’s counsel had argued that RISD asserted its undue\nburden defense in bad faith and failed to produce any evidence supporting the\ndefense despite repeated discovery requests. However, as this court noted,\n“RISD provided substantial discovery materials related to the analyses the\nschool district performed when evaluating what modifications would be made to\nfacilities in the district and how budgetary funds would be allocated, by priority,\nto modification projects.” Greer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">833367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10. Moreover, both this\ncourt and the district court concluded that RISD had an evidentiary basis for its\nundue burden defense.5 See id.\n       After the district court explicitly found that RISD asserted its undue\nburden defense in good faith, Greer reiterated the argument that RISD was\n\n\n       5\n         Much of Greer’s counsel’s briefing on appeal merely reiterates the position that RISD\nhad no basis for asserting its undue burden defense—an argument repeatedly rejected by the\ndistrict court and rejected by this court as well.\n\n                                              9\n\f  Case: 11-10830    Document: 00511886383       Page: 10   Date Filed: 06/13/2012\n\n\n\n                                  No. 11-10830\n\nasserting the defense in bad faith in her Motion to Deny Costs. In denying\nGreer’s motion, the district court noted its consistent rejection of Greer’s\narguments regarding RISD’s undue burden defense and stated that “Plaintiff\nhas not only failed to show good cause for the Court to deny costs . . . but she has\nalso brought a frivolous motion . . . [and] unreasonably multiplied the\nproceedings.”\n      In light of the magistrate judge’s findings described above and adopted by\nthe district court, as well as our review of the record and relevant pleadings, we\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding\nattorneys’ fees to RISD under § 1927. Greer’s counsel challenges the amount of\nthe fees awarded and contends that the district court did not properly limit the\naward to those fees caused by any vexatious and unreasonable conduct. The\nmagistrate judge found that RISD had incurred a total of $206,004.25 in\nattorneys’ fees and $29,355.00 in paralegal fees in defending against Greer’s\nclaims, amounts well in excess of those awarded. In addition, the magistrate\njudge expressly found that the fees sought by RISD were only the portion\nattributable the unreasonable and vexatious conduct of Greer’s counsel. We\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to\nsegregate fees further.\n                               III. CONCLUSION\n      For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district\ncourt. Costs shall be borne by Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\f</pre>",
