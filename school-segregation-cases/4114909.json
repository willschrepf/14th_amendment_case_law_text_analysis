Grubbs appeals from the September 29, 2015\n\nJudgment Entry of Prison Sentence of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas.\n\nAppellee is the state of Ohio.\n\n                        FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       {¶2} “Jane Doe” was 9 years old at the time of the crimes described herein and\n\n10 years old at the time of trial. “Mary Doe” was 5 years old. The girls have a 4-year-old\n\nbrother, “John Doe.” The children’s relatives other than appellant will be referred to as\n\n“Mother” and “Grandmother” to preserve the anonymity of the child victims. Appellant is\n\nMother’s uncle and Grandmother is the children’s maternal great-grandmother.\n\n       {¶3} The three children were frequently left in the care of relatives while Mother\n\nworked. Appellant would watch all three children at Grandmother’s house because he\n\nlived in a small apartment and Grandmother had more room to play. The children also\n\nhad their own rooms and duplicate toys at Grandmother’s house.\n\n       {¶4} Appellant was often the only adult with the children because Grandmother\n\nwas at work during the day.      Appellant would shuttle the children between school,\n\npreschool, and daycare as needed. Appellant would take the children to their favorite\n\nrestaurants including Taco Bell and Burger King and sometimes bought toys for them.\n\nAppellant bought Jane Doe a Monster High doll she was particularly fond of.\n\n       {¶5} On Monday, December 29, 2014, the children were on Christmas break\n\nfrom school. Mother and Grandmother worked during the day so appellant watched all\n\nthree children at Grandmother’s house. Mother picked up Mary Doe and John Doe\n\naround 12:30, but appellant asked if he could keep Jane Doe for the afternoon so they\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     3\n\n\ncould spend time together before Jane Doe returned to school. Appellant returned Jane\n\nDoe to Mother’s home around 5:30 p.m.\n\n           {¶6} The next day, Tuesday, December 30, 2014, appellant again volunteered\n\nto watch the children while Mother and Grandmother worked. This time, Mother picked\n\nup Jane Doe and John Doe around 12:30 p.m. and appellant asked to spend the\n\nafternoon alone with Mary Doe. Appellant brought Mary Doe home and dropped her off\n\naround 5:30 p.m. The family ate dinner and Mother’s boyfriend, Robert Flores, came\n\nover. The girls were playing upstairs and Jane Doe came down to tell Mother “something\n\nbad was happening” and they needed to talk about it. Jane Doe said Mary Doe was afraid\n\nto tell.\n\n           {¶7} Mother found Mary Doe in her closet, crying and afraid. It took Mother\n\ntwenty minutes to coax Mary Doe from the closet and to ask her what was wrong. Mary\n\nDoe was afraid she would be in trouble. Finally Mary Doe said, “Mommy, don’t make us\n\ngo with Uncle Michael anymore.” She told her mother appellant had been kissing her on\n\nthe lips and putting his hands down her pants, and she was afraid. At trial Mary Doe\n\ntestified appellant touched her on her “private part” under her clothes and indicated her\n\nvagina. She said the last time it happened was the last time she saw appellant, i.e.\n\nDecember 30.\n\n           {¶8} Mother asked Jane Doe if this happened to her as well and Jane Doe said\n\nyes. At trial, Jane Doe testified appellant touched her “boobs,” “pee-pee,” and “butt,” over\n\nher clothes and under her clothes. Jane Doe also testified to digital penetration. Jane\n\nDoe testified appellant told her not to tell anyone and bought her things if she allowed him\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     4\n\n\nto touch her, including the Monster High doll. When Jane Doe learned the same things\n\nwere happening to Mary Doe, she felt it was time to disclose to their mother.\n\n       {¶9} Mary Doe testified the abuse was ongoing until the night she and Jane Doe\n\ntold their mother. She and Jane Doe had never discussed the abuse with each other or\n\nwith anyone else until the night of the disclosure.\n\n       {¶10} That night, Mother told her boyfriend and also her Aunt, appellant’s sister.\n\nAunt is a nurse and told Mother to take the girls to the hospital right away. Mother took\n\nthem to a hospital the next morning.\n\n       {¶11} In the meantime, Aunt, appellant, and their spouses went to Delaware\n\nCounty Children’s Services and reported that the girls were being molested.1\n\n       {¶12} A pediatric SANE nurse examined both children at Nationwide Children’s\n\nHospital and collected rape kits. The nurse testified both exams were “normal” and she\n\ndid not observe any genital trauma to either victim. She testified these findings were\n\nneither unusual nor unexpected in light of the allegations of touching and digital\n\npenetration.\n\n       {¶13} A forensic analyst from B.C.I. testified about examination of the rape kits for\n\nD.N.A. evidence. No semen was found and no foreign D.N.A. was located on either\n\nvictim. The analyst noted a tiny amount of male D.N.A. was found on a swab taken from\n\nJane Doe’s breasts and a tiny amount of male D.N.A. was found on a swab of amylase\n\nfound in Mary Doe’s underwear. The presence of the male chromosome was noted but\n\nthe sample was too miniscule to provide any basis for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n1The relatives named the perpetrator as Mother’s boyfriend Robert Flores, an allegation\nwhich was alluded to at trial.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                   5\n\n\n       {¶14} A forensic interviewer from Nationwide Children’s Hospital spoke to both\n\ngirls and testified at trial. She said Jane Doe reported sexual abuse by appellant at\n\nGrandmother’s house: appellant touched her breasts more than once, rubbed his penis\n\non her vagina with clothes on more than once, and put his finger inside her vagina. Jane\n\nDoe said the last incident occurred the last time she saw appellant, or Monday, December\n\n29, 2014.\n\n       {¶15} Mary Doe also disclosed sexual abuse by appellant to the forensic\n\ninterviewer: appellant touched, rubbed, and hurt her vagina, on top of clothes and with\n\nbare skin, and put his finger inside her vagina. It happened many times but the most\n\nrecent occurrence was the last time she saw appellant, or Tuesday, December 30, 2014.\n\n       {¶16} Detective Daniel Madden of the Delaware City Police Department\n\ninvestigated the allegations which were reported to him via Grady Memorial Hospital.\n\nMadden instructed Mother to take the girls to Nationwide Children’s Hospital and she\n\ncomplied. Madden advised Children’s Services of the allegations and learned appellant\n\nand his family had come to Children’s Services earlier the same day to report the abuse,\n\nalthough they named a different perpetrator.\n\n       {¶17} Madden called appellant and appellant volunteered to come in to speak to\n\nhim. Madden testified appellant said he played a “grandfatherly” role with the girls.\n\nMadden asked why the girls would make up sexual abuse allegations and appellant said\n\nmaybe someone else did it. Madden noted appellant made a strange comment about\n\ntelling “her” that if it was a boy and had a penis, it “leaked.” Madden observed appellant\n\nhad a very dry mouth throughout the interview which the detective interpreted as an\n\nindication appellant was lying. Appellant told Madden he and Aunt went to Children’s\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                    6\n\n\nServices to start an investigation because his sister (Aunt) thinks something else was\n\ngoing on.\n\n       {¶18} When Madden asked directly if he ever touched the girls’ breasts, vaginal\n\nareas, or buttocks, appellant denied the abuse and said if those touches happened they\n\nwere unintentional in the bathtub or when the girls would jump on him. Madden also\n\nconfronted appellant with the specific allegation that he kissed Mary Doe on the lips.\n\nAppellant said Mary Doe always kisses him on the lips; he said he has tried to stop her\n\nfrom doing it but she persisted.\n\n       {¶19} Madden testified he found it strange that although appellant has children of\n\nhis own, the desktop photograph on his cell phone screen was of Jane and Mary Doe.\n\n       {¶20} Appellant testified on his own behalf at trial. He described many photos and\n\nvideos of Jane, Mary, and John Doe on his cell phone; in some of the photos the girls are\n\ndressed up in costumes or makeup, and in some the children are sleeping. Appellant\n\nsaid the children did not ask to have their photos taken but did not object. In one video,\n\nhe described Mary Doe “shaking [her] behind” and said it made him very uncomfortable\n\nand he had to correct the behavior. He said he observed this type of behavior “frequently.”\n\n       {¶21} Several of appellant’s friends and family members testified on his behalf at\n\ntrial, including Aunt and Grandmother, among others. The witnesses testified they did\n\nnot believe appellant had the propensity to molest children and described various\n\ndevelopmental issues with the children and problems with Mother’s parenting. The\n\nwitnesses insinuated that the children’s behavioral problems were consistent with sexual\n\nabuse but that Mother’s boyfriend was the perpetrator instead of appellant.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     7\n\n\n         {¶22} Appellant was charged by indictment as follows: Count I, rape of a child\n\nunder the age of 13 [Jane Doe], a felony of the first degree pursuant to R.C.\n\n2907.02(A)(1)(b); Count II, forcible rape of Jane Doe pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), a\n\nfelony of the first degree; Count III, gross sexual imposition against a child under the age\n\nof 13 [Jane Doe], a felony of the third degree pursuant to R.C. 2907.05(A)(4); Count IV,\n\nforcible gross sexual imposition against Jane Doe, a felony of the fourth degree pursuant\n\nto R.C. 2907.05(A)(1); Count V, rape of a child under the age of 13 [Mary Doe], noting\n\nMary Doe was under the age of 10, a felony of the first degree pursuant to R.C.\n\n2907.02(A)(1)(b), a felony of the first degree; Count VI, forcible rape of Mary Doe pursuant\n\nto R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), a felony of the first degree; Count VII, gross sexual imposition\n\nagainst a child under the age of 13 [Mary Doe], a felony of the third degree pursuant to\n\nR.C. 2907.05(A)(4); and Count VIII, forcible gross sexual imposition against Mary Doe, a\n\nfelony of the fourth degree pursuant to R.C. 2907.05(A)(1).\n\n         {¶23} The indictment states that Counts I through IV arose on or around\n\nDecember 29, 2014, and Counts V through VIII arose on or around December 30, 2014.\n\n         {¶24} Appellant entered pleas of not guilty. He moved to sever trial of the counts\n\nrelative to each of the two victims; appellee responded in opposition. The motion to sever\n\nproceeded to oral argument and was denied by judgment entry dated March 27, 2015.2\n\n         {¶25} On July 23, 2015, appellant moved the trial court to call Robert Flores,\n\nMother’s boyfriend, as a court’s witness pursuant to Evid.R. 614.          Appellee filed a\n\nresponse in opposition.\n\n\n\n\n2   A number of other motions not relevant to this appeal were filed by both parties.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                         8\n\n\n       {¶26} On August 5, 2015, the trial court overruled appellant’s motion to call Robert\n\nFlores as a court’s witness, noting “[t]he defense has no good faith basis to believe Mr.\n\nFlores is involved in any way with molesting the girls except for the allegations coming\n\nforth after he entered their lives” and “[t]he Court does not feel it is necessary * * * to call\n\nMr. Flores because there has been no showing he has any information material to the\n\noffenses.”\n\n       {¶27} Appellee also filed a motion in limine asking the trial court to prohibit\n\nappellant from introducing evidence of Flores’ rape conviction involving a victim described\n\nas an “adult ex-girlfriend.”\n\n       {¶28} The case proceeded to trial by jury. Appellant moved for judgment of\n\nacquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A) at the conclusion of appellee’s evidence and at the\n\nconclusion of all of the evidence; the motions were overruled. On August 31, 2015,\n\nappellant was found not guilty upon Counts I and II [rape of Jane Doe]; guilty upon Counts\n\nIII and IV [gross sexual imposition against Jane Doe]; and guilty of Counts VII and VIII\n\n[gross sexual imposition against Mary Doe]. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous\n\nverdict upon Counts V and VI [rape of Mary Doe].\n\n       {¶29} On September 15, 2015, appellant filed a motion to set aside the verdicts\n\nand enter judgments of acquittal or in the alternative a motion for new trial. Appellee\n\nresponded with a motion in opposition.         On September 25, 2015, appellant filed a\n\n“Defendant’s Proffer of Evidence” excluded at trial.\n\n       {¶30} Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court found Counts IV and VIII to\n\nbe allied offenses of similar import and thus proceeded to sentence appellant upon\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                  9\n\n\nCounts III and VII. The trial court imposed two concurrent terms of 24 months in prison.\n\nAppellant was found to be a Tier II sex offender.\n\n       {¶31} On October 1, 2015, by judgment entry, the trial court sustained appellant’s\n\nmotion for acquittal as to Counts V and VI [rape of Mary Doe] but otherwise overruled the\n\nmotion to set aside the verdict and motion for new trial.\n\n       {¶32} Appellant now appeals from the judgment entry of sentence and from the\n\njudgment entry denying the motion to set aside the verdict and for new trial.\n\n       {¶33} Appellant raises six assignments of error:\n\n                              ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n       {¶34} “I. THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED APPELLANT’S FEDERAL AND STATE\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL, AND CRIM.R. 14, BY REUSING TO\n\nSEVER THE COUNTS RELATING TO SEPARATE VICTIMS.”\n\n       {¶35} “II. THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED APPELLANT’S FEDERAL AND STATE\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL AND TO PRESENT A COMPLETE\n\nDEFENSE BY EXCLUDING EVIDENCE OF ROBERT FLORES’ PRIOR SEX\n\nOFFENSE.”\n\n       {¶36} “III.   THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED APPELLANT’S FEDERAL AND\n\nSTATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL AND TO PRESENT A\n\nCOMPLETE DEFENSE BY EXCLUDING EVIDENCE THAT ROBERT FLORES WAS\n\nABUSING THE GIRLS.”\n\n       {¶37} “IV. APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS RIGHTS TO THE EFFECTIVE\n\nASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL UNDER THE SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS\n\nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND THE OHIO CONSTITUTION,\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                 10\n\n\nARTICLE I, SECTION 10, BY COUNSEL’S FAILURE TO RENEW THE SEVERANCE\n\nARGUMENT.”\n\n       {¶38} “V. APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS RIGHTS TO THE EFFECTIVE\n\nASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL UNDER THE SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS\n\nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND THE OHIO CONSTITUTION,\n\nARTICLE I, SECTION 10, BY COUNSEL’S FAILURE TO TIMELY OFFER RELEVANT\n\nEVIDENCE.”\n\n       {¶39} “VI. APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS\n\nAND A FAIR TRIAL UNDER THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS BY THE\n\nCUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE NUMEROUS ERRORS IN THIS CASE.”\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n                                            I.\n\n       {¶40} In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred in\n\nfailing to sever the counts pertaining to each of the two victims. We disagree.\n\n       {¶41} We examined joinder and severance in the context of sexual assault\n\nallegations in State v. Meeks, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014CA00017, 2015-Ohio-1527, 34\n\nN.E.3d 382, appeal not allowed, 143 Ohio St.3d 1543, 2015-Ohio-4633, 40 N.E.3d 1180,\n\nand a similar analysis is applicable here. In both cases, defendants faced a single trial\n\nupon multiple sexual-assault-related charges against two victims.\n\n       {¶42} Joinder of offenses is governed by Crim. R. 8(A); offenses may be joined if\n\nthey are of the same or similar character, are based on the same act or transaction, or\n\nare based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or part of a common\n\nscheme or course of criminal conduct. Joinder is liberally permitted to conserve judicial\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                       11\n\n\nresources, reduce the chance of incongruous results in successive trials, and diminish\n\ninconvenience to witnesses. See, State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343, 421 N.E.2d\n\n1288 (1981). Joinder is appropriate where the evidence is interlocking and the jury is\n\ncapable of segregating the proof required for each offense. State v. Czajka, 101 Ohio\n\nApp.3d 564, 577–578, 656 N.E.2d 9 (8th Dist.1995).\n\n       {¶43} If similar offenses are properly joined pursuant to Crim. R. 8(A), the accused\n\nmay move to sever the charges pursuant to Crim. R. 14, wherein the burden is on the\n\ndefendant to demonstrate his rights would be prejudiced by joinder. State v. Strobel, 51\n\nOhio App.3d 31, 33, 554 N.E.2d 916 (3rd Dist.1988). Appellant argues the trial court erred\n\nin overruling his motion to sever. To prevail on such a claim, the defendant has the burden\n\nof demonstrating: 1) his rights were actually prejudiced; 2) at the time of the motion to\n\nsever, the defendant provided the trial court with sufficient information so that it could\n\nweigh the considerations favoring joinder against the potential prejudice the defendant's\n\nright to a fair trial; and 3) given the information provided to the court, the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to sever the charges. State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 59, 600\n\nN.E.2d 661 (1992), citing State v. Hamblin, 37 Ohio St.3d 153, 158–159, 524 N.E.2d 476\n\n(1988) and Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d 85 (D.C.Cir.1964). A defendant has not\n\ndemonstrated prejudice where: (1) if the counts were severed, evidence of alleged\n\nmisconduct from each count would be admissible in separate trials, and (2) if such\n\nevidence would not be admissible, the evidence of each count is simple and distinct. Id.\n\n       {¶44} If evidence of the offenses against Jane Doe is admissible at trial of the\n\noffenses against Mary Doe, and vice-versa, appellant has not demonstrated prejudice.\n\n“If the evidence of other crimes would be admissible at separate trials, any ‘prejudice that\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                      12\n\n\nmight result from the jury's hearing the evidence of the other crime in a joint trial would\n\nbe no different from that possible in separate trials,’ and a court need not inquire further.”\n\nSchaim, supra, 65 Ohio St.3d at 59, 600 N.E.2d 661, internal citation omitted.\n\nAccordingly, we must determine the extent to which evidence of each of these crimes\n\nwould be admissible in other trials if the counts were severed. State v. Markwell, 5th Dist.\n\nMuskingum No. CT2011–0056, 2012-Ohio-3096, 2012 WL 2613903, ¶ 46.\n\n       {¶45} The admission of other-acts evidence is limited because of the substantial\n\ndanger a jury will convict the defendant solely because it assumes that the defendant has\n\na propensity to commit criminal acts, or deserves punishment regardless of whether he\n\nor she committed the crime charged in the indictment, and this danger is especially high\n\nin a case “of an inflammatory nature” such as this one. Schaim, supra, 65 Ohio St.3d at\n\n59, 600 N.E.2d 661, citing State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 68, 330 N.E.2d 720 (1975).\n\nHowever, “[a]s long as used for purposes other than proving that the accused acted in\n\nconformity with a particular character trait, Evid.R. 404(B) permits the admission of ‘other\n\nacts' evidence if it is ‘related to and share[s] common features with the crime in question.’\n\n” State v. Markwell, supra, 2012-Ohio-3096, 2012 WL 2613903, at ¶ 45, citing State v.\n\nLowe, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 634 N.E.2d 616 (1994), paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶46} In this case, the other-acts evidence pertaining to each victim is related to\n\nand shares common features with the crimes committed against the other victim.\n\nAppellant has access to both victims because he babysits them; the victims are sisters\n\nand appellant is their great-uncle. Each victim was isolated by appellant and kept by him\n\nfor an afternoon alone when the abuse occurred. The charged acts of abuse occurred\n\nwithin two days of each other, although ongoing continuous abuse was alleged.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                   13\n\n\n          {¶47} Appellee argues the evidence of each offense would have been admissible\n\nat separate trials pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), which states in pertinent part: “Evidence of\n\nother crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order\n\nto show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes,\n\nsuch as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\n\nabsence of mistake or accident. * * * *.” The Rule is in accord with R.C. 2945.59, which\n\nstates:\n\n                      In any criminal case in which the defendant's motive or intent,\n\n                the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's\n\n                scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the\n\n                defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of\n\n                mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant's scheme, plan, or\n\n                system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are\n\n                contemporaneous      with   or   prior   or   subsequent     thereto,\n\n                notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the\n\n                commission of another crime by the defendant.\n\n          {¶48} In State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 330 N.E.2d 720 (1975), the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court held “other acts” testimony, in order to be admissible under the scheme\n\nor plan exception, must: (1) illustrate the immediate background of the crime charged,\n\nsuch that without this testimony it would be virtually impossible to prove that the accused\n\ncommitted the crime; or (2) establish the identity of the perpetrator. The Court has\n\nsubsequently limited its holding in Curry: “Pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), * * * evidence of\n\nother crimes, wrongs, or acts of an accused may be admissible to prove intent or plan,\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                   14\n\n\neven if the identity of an accused or the immediate background of a crime is not at issue.”\n\nState v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 522, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, 1280, ¶\n\n2 (2012).\n\n       {¶49} Williams gives us a framework within which to evaluate the other-acts\n\nevidence:\n\n                     The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence\n\n              is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the\n\n              determination of the action more or less probable than it would be\n\n              without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. The next step is to consider\n\n              whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented\n\n              to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in\n\n              conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented\n\n              for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B). The\n\n              third step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts\n\n              evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\n\n              prejudice. See Evid.R. 403.\n\n                     State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983\n\n              N.E.2d 1278, ¶ 20.\n\n       {¶50} In the instant case, the evidence pertaining to each offense does have the\n\ntendency to prove appellant engaged in a similar plan or method of conduct with both\n\nvictims and to prove his motive, intent, or plan. The nature of the allegations is similar:\n\ntouching over and under the clothing over time. The final incidents occurred within 24\n\nhours of each other, with each victim isolated by appellant and kept alone with him.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     15\n\n\nAppellant took each victim to a favorite restaurant consistent with allegations he groomed\n\nand rewarded the victims for acts of abuse.\n\n       {¶51} Having reviewed the substantial record of this case, we are convinced the\n\nevidence against both victims was not presented to prove appellant’s character in order\n\nto show activity in conformity therewith. Appellant told Madden he may have touched the\n\ngirls accidentally in the bathtub or when they climbed on him to play; the similar\n\ncircumstances of the offenses against both victims defeats this explanation and points to\n\nappellant’s motive and intent. Appellant and his witnesses implied the girls’ behavioral\n\nproblems were consistent with sexual abuse but pointed to a different perpetrator; the\n\nrelated allegations involving two victims point to appellant’s identity as the perpetrator.\n\n       {¶52} From our review of the evidence, we find: 1) the acts were against family\n\nmembers, 2) the acts occurred when the children were isolated with appellant after he\n\nasked to be alone with them and 3) the allegations of touching over and under the clothing\n\nwere similar. State v. Markwell, 5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2011-0056, 2012-Ohio-3096,\n\n¶ 48, citing State v. Ickes, 5th Dist. No.1999AP080052, 2000 WL 874728 (June 13, 2000).\n\n“These facts clearly indicate a ‘scheme, plan or system’ negating any claim of accident.”\n\nId. Further, the acts were consecutive in nature, and each victim testified separately. Id.\n\nThe issues were clearly laid out for the jury, and the jury was instructed that each count\n\nand victim should be considered from its own evidence. Id.\n\n       {¶53} The third step in the Williams analysis is whether the probative value of\n\neach incident is outweighed by the prejudice risked in its admission. Williams, supra, 2-\n\n2012-Ohio-5695 at ¶ 20. Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in\n\nan improper basis for a jury decision. State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                       16\n\n\n6550, 820 N.E.2d 302 ¶ 24. Because fairness is subjective, the determination whether\n\nevidence is unfairly prejudicial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be\n\noverturned only if the discretion is abused. Id., citing State v. Robb, 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 68,\n\n723 N.E.2d 1019 (2000). In light of our conclusions above, we find the probative value of\n\nadmitting the evidence in a single trial outweighs any prejudice to appellant.\n\n       {¶54} Consequently, evidence that appellant molested both sisters under similar\n\ncircumstances was admissible in a single trial. Williams, supra, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-\n\nOhio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, at ¶ 2; see also, State v. Musgrave, 5th Dist. Stark No. 97–\n\nCA–0135, 1998 WL 818067, *3 (Oct. 26, 1998); State v. Markwell, 5th Dist. Muskingum\n\nNo. CT2011–0056, 2012-Ohio-3096, 2012 WL 2613903, supra; State v. Brown, 5th Dist.\n\nDelaware No. 2005CAA010002, 2005-Ohio-5639, 2005 WL 2727129.\n\n       {¶55} We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's\n\nmotion to sever.\n\n       {¶56} We further note evidence of each crime is simple and distinct. The jury was\n\ncapable of separating the proof of multiple charges where, as here, the evidence of each\n\ncrime is uncomplicated. State v. Hamblin, 37 Ohio St.3d 153, 159, 524 N.E.2d 476 (1988).\n\nEach victim testified separately and the prosecution introduced evidence of each distinct\n\ncrime. The jury was evidently able to separate the evidence against each victim upon\n\neach count because appellant was found not guilty of the rape offenses against Jane Doe\n\nand was unable to reach a verdict upon the rape counts against Mary Doe.\n\n       {¶57} We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the\n\nmotion to sever. Appellant's first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n\n                                            II., III.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                    17\n\n\n       {¶58} Appellant’s second and third assignments of error are related and will be\n\nconsidered together. Appellant argues the trial court erred in excluding evidence of\n\nRobert Flores’ prior conviction and in excluding purported “evidence * * * Flores was\n\nabusing the girls.” We disagree.\n\n       {¶59} The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence is a matter left to the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court. Absent an abuse of discretion resulting in material prejudice\n\nto the defendant, a reviewing court should be reluctant to interfere with a trial court’s\n\ndecision in this regard. State v. Hymore, 9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 224 N.E.2d 126 (1967).\n\n       {¶60} Appellant argues the trial court erred in several ways with respect to rulings\n\nregarding Flores and his criminal history. We will address each in turn, but we begin by\n\nnoting there is no evidence in this record Flores committed the offenses appellant was\n\ncharged with. The evidence appellant points to consists of the testimony of his family\n\nmembers which premised upon rumor, supposition, and innuendo. The sole established\n\nfact against Flores is that he has a 2004 conviction for attempted rape against an adult\n\nfemale victim described by appellee as an ex-girlfriend.\n\n       {¶61} First, appellant argues the trial court should have called Flores as a court’s\n\nwitness “so that the defense could impeach Flores with his prior conviction for attempted\n\nrape and status as a registered sex offender.” (Brief, 24). Ohio Evid. R. 614(A) states\n\n“[t]he court may, on its own motion or at the suggestion of a party, call witnesses, and all\n\nparties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called.”\n\n       {¶62} At the hearing on appellant’s motion, appellant presented evidence Flores\n\nwas convicted of attempted rape in 2004 and is a registered sex offender. (Appellee\n\nstated at the hearing that the rape offense involved an adult ex-girlfriend and had no\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     18\n\n\nconnection at all with the instant case.) Defense trial counsel stated he “assumed” Mother\n\nwould have explained Flores’ status as a sex offender to her children and told them to\n\n“mind [ ] themselves” around him. (T. 8/4/2015, 6-7). Counsel argued this assumption is\n\nrelevant as follows:\n\n                              One of the questions the jury is likely to ask themselves\n\n                       is why would girls of this age have knowledge of these\n\n                       subjects but for the fact that they engaged in this behavior.\n\n                              This goes to a source of knowledge, your Honor. That\n\n                       conversation would have provided them information about the\n\n                       importance of telling somebody if somebody—if you’re being\n\n                       touched and what the consequences of that are.\n\n                       T. 8/4/2015, 7.\n\n       {¶63} The trial court questioned counsel whether the true purpose of calling Flores\n\nas a court’s witness was to accuse him of being the perpetrator of the abuse against the\n\ngirls and pointed out that calling Flores as a witness bore no relationship to the girls’\n\n“knowledge of sex abuse.” The following conversation took place:\n\n                              [DEFENSE COUNSEL:] * * * *.\n\n                              We’ll be able to essentially impeach his testimony\n\n              extrinsically just through knowledge of other people, and that goes\n\n              to his believability when I do ask him that ultimate question.\n\n                              Are you the person that did this and he says, no, if he’s\n\n              lied about six other things, Judge, the jury’s going to have the\n\n              opportunity to weigh that.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                    19\n\n\n                            And I think that’s an important factor for them to weigh\n\n              when there’s a man who’s been sleeping in the same house, taking\n\n              care of these girls for at least six weeks, and really longer than that,\n\n              he’s been a part of their lives for 11 months, he was their primary\n\n              caregiver for six weeks.\n\n                            With that much interaction with the girls immediately\n\n              before these allegations, I think that’s an important piece for the jury\n\n              to know.\n\n                            * * * *.\n\n              THE COURT: So do you have any good-faith basis to believe that he\n\n     molested these girls or are you just putting him on the stand as a strawman out\n\n     there?\n\n              [DEFENSE COUNSEL:] He’s not a strawman, sir. But he has—he’s—he\n\n     is the change in the girls’ lives.       That’s my good-faith basis is that almost\n\n     immediately prior to these allegations coming out is when he’s the person that\n\n     starts babysitting them.\n\n              [Appellant] had been part of their life for two years, and then six weeks we\n\n     have this happen.\n\n              I have other—I have other witnesses who will testify to change in their\n\n     behavior during that six weeks.\n\n              Do I have any—do I have a video or a confession or statement that says\n\n     he’s the one that did this? No, sir.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     20\n\n\n              But I have—I have quite a bit of other information that really raises some\n\n       red flags, and I think those are red flags that the jury’s entitled to hear and judge\n\n       for themselves.\n\n              * * * *.\n\n       T. 8/4/2015, 16-18.\n\n       {¶64} The trial court deferred ruling upon the motion to call Flores as a court’s\n\nwitness but later denied the motion. The trial court also provisionally granted appellee’s\n\nmotion in limine prohibiting mention of the attempted rape conviction. (T. I., 19-21.)\n\n       {¶65} Flores’ criminal conviction is not relevant and cross-examination of him in\n\nan attempt to paint him as the perpetrator of the crimes is not within the parameters of\n\nEvid.R. 614(A). “A trial court possesses the authority in the exercise of sound discretion\n\nto call individuals as witnesses of the court.” State v. Arnold, 189 Ohio App.3d 507, 2010-\n\nOhio-5379, 939 N.E.2d 218, ¶ 44 (2nd Dist.), citing State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151,\n\n404 N.E.2d 144 (1980), paragraph four of the syllabus. “[L]imitations on the application\n\nof a rule like Evid.R. 614 reflect a concern that its cross-examination provision not swallow\n\nup the fundamental requirement imposed by Evid.R. 402 that in order to be admissible,\n\nevidence of a court's witness must be relevant; that is, the evidence must have ‘any\n\ntendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination\n\nof the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.’” Id.\n\nat ¶ 47, citing Evid.R. 401.\n\n       {¶66} In this case, the trial court’s decision to disallow Flores as a court’s witness\n\nis not an abuse of discretion. The attenuated reason appellant cited for calling Flores as\n\na witness (that Mother may have spoken to the girls about his past, thereby explaining\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                   21\n\n\nhow the girls are aware of sexual abuse terms) has no “tendency to make the existence\n\nof any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\n\nprobable than it would be without the evidence.” Arnold, supra, 2010-Ohio-5379 at ¶ 47.\n\nThe trial court noted appellant’s underlying purpose was to cast Flores as a “strawman”\n\nalternate suspect, and counsel could cite no reason supporting a good-faith belief that\n\nFlores was a credible alternate suspect. Appellant argues the defense theory was that\n\nthe victims were afraid to go home to Mother’s house because they were alone with Flores\n\nthere and he abused them, “like Mother’s previous boyfriends,” but Mother would not\n\nbelieve them. Thus they made false allegations against appellant to gain Mother’s\n\n“attention, sympathy, and protection.” This theory is not supported by the evidence at\n\ntrial.\n\n         {¶67} Appellant further argues he should have been permitted to introduce\n\n“evidence Flores was abusing the girls.” In support of this unsubstantiated allegation,\n\nappellant points to his proffer of evidence at sentencing which consists of an affidavit of\n\nan adult trial witness stating she was sexually assaulted by Flores; an affidavit by\n\nGrandmother stating Jane Doe told her Flores spanked her and Mother lies; and an\n\naffidavit of Aunt stating she told D.J.F.S. she believed Flores “was the perpetrator\n\nbecause he is a convicted sex offender, another young lady had disclosed a sexual\n\nassault to me in which he was the perpetrator and the children’s behavior around him\n\nappears frightened.”\n\n         {¶68} This “evidence” does not support appellant’s allegation Flores perpetrated\n\nthe acts of abuse appellant was charged with committing, nor is such “evidence”\n\nadmissible at appellant’s trial. We note appellant cites no evidentiary basis upon which\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                      22\n\n\nthe information contained in the affidavits would be admissible. The trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in disallowing any of the cited “evidence” at trial.\n\n       {¶69} Appellant’s second and third assignments of error are overruled.\n\n                                               IV., V.\n\n       {¶70} In his fourth and fifth assignments of error, appellant argues he received\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel. We disagree.\n\n       {¶71} To succeed on a claim of ineffectiveness, a defendant must satisfy a two-\n\nprong test. Initially, a defendant must show that trial counsel acted incompetently. See,\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). In assessing such claims,\n\n“a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide\n\nrange of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the\n\npresumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action ‘might be considered\n\nsound trial strategy.’” Id. at 689, citing Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158\n\n(1955).\n\n       {¶72} “There are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case.\n\nEven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same\n\nway.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. The question is whether counsel acted “outside the\n\nwide range of professionally competent assistance.” Id. at 690.\n\n       {¶73} Even if a defendant shows that counsel was incompetent, the defendant\n\nmust then satisfy the second prong of the Strickland test. Under this “actual prejudice”\n\nprong, the defendant must show that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                    23\n\n\n       {¶74} Appellant argues trial counsel was ineffective in failing to renew the\n\nargument to sever the counts at the close of all of the evidence. Appellant moved to sever\n\nprior to trial but did not renew the motion at the close of the appellee’s case and at the\n\nconclusion of all evidence. Some Ohio courts have held a failure to renew a motion to\n\nsever constitutes a waiver. State v. Musgrave, 5th Dist. Stark No. 97-CA-0135, 1998 WL\n\n818067, *2 (Oct. 26, 1998). However, we generally prefer to address this claim on its\n\nmerits as we have done here. Id. Appellant has thus failed to demonstrate that he was\n\nprejudiced by counsel’s failure to renew the motion. See, State v. Hamblin, 37 Ohio St.3d\n\n153, 524 N.E.2d 476 (1988).\n\n       {¶75} Appellant further argues trial counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the\n\n“evidence” described in the proffer earlier in the trial, particularly the claim that Flores\n\nallegedly sexually assaulted an adult. Appellant offers no explanation how this evidence\n\nwould have been admissible during the adult witness’ testimony. As we discussed supra,\n\nthis “evidence” is not relevant or admissible. We thus fail to see how counsel could have\n\napproached introduction of the claims any differently.\n\n       {¶76} Appellant has not demonstrated ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n\nAssignments of error numbers four and five are overruled.\n\n                                              VI.\n\n       {¶77} In his sixth assignment of error, appellant claims cumulative errors in his\n\ntrial deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree.\n\n       {¶78} In State v. Garner, 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 656 N.E.2d 623 (1995), the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court held pursuant to the cumulative error doctrine “a conviction will be\n\nreversed where the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of the\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                  24\n\n\nconstitutional right to a fair trial even though each of numerous instances of trial court\n\nerror does not individually constitute cause for reversal.”\n\n       {¶79} In the instant case, we do not find multiple instances of harmless error\n\ntriggering the cumulative error doctrine, and appellant's sixth assignment of error is\n\ntherefore overruled. State v. Scott, 5th Dist. Richland No. 11CA80, 2012-Ohio-3482, ¶\n\n76.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n       {¶80} Appellant’s six assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the\n\nDelaware County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\nBy: Delaney, J. and\n\nGwin, P.J.\n\nBaldwin, J., concur.\n\f",

Grubbs appeals from the September 29, 2015\n\nJudgment Entry of Prison Sentence of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas.\n\nAppellee is the state of Ohio.\n\n                        FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       {¶2} “Jane Doe” was 9 years old at the time of the crimes described herein and\n\n10 years old at the time of trial. “Mary Doe” was 5 years old. The girls have a 4-year-old\n\nbrother, “John Doe.” The children’s relatives other than appellant will be referred to as\n\n“Mother” and “Grandmother” to preserve the anonymity of the child victims. Appellant is\n\nMother’s uncle and Grandmother is the children’s maternal great-grandmother.\n\n       {¶3} The three children were frequently left in the care of relatives while Mother\n\nworked. Appellant would watch all three children at Grandmother’s house because he\n\nlived in a small apartment and Grandmother had more room to play. The children also\n\nhad their own rooms and duplicate toys at Grandmother’s house.\n\n       {¶4} Appellant was often the only adult with the children because Grandmother\n\nwas at work during the day.      Appellant would shuttle the children between school,\n\npreschool, and daycare as needed. Appellant would take the children to their favorite\n\nrestaurants including Taco Bell and Burger King and sometimes bought toys for them.\n\nAppellant bought Jane Doe a Monster High doll she was particularly fond of.\n\n       {¶5} On Monday, December 29, 2014, the children were on Christmas break\n\nfrom school. Mother and Grandmother worked during the day so appellant watched all\n\nthree children at Grandmother’s house. Mother picked up Mary Doe and John Doe\n\naround 12:30, but appellant asked if he could keep Jane Doe for the afternoon so they\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     3\n\n\ncould spend time together before Jane Doe returned to school. Appellant returned Jane\n\nDoe to Mother’s home around 5:30 p.m.\n\n           {¶6} The next day, Tuesday, December 30, 2014, appellant again volunteered\n\nto watch the children while Mother and Grandmother worked. This time, Mother picked\n\nup Jane Doe and John Doe around 12:30 p.m. and appellant asked to spend the\n\nafternoon alone with Mary Doe. Appellant brought Mary Doe home and dropped her off\n\naround 5:30 p.m. The family ate dinner and Mother’s boyfriend, Robert Flores, came\n\nover. The girls were playing upstairs and Jane Doe came down to tell Mother “something\n\nbad was happening” and they needed to talk about it. Jane Doe said Mary Doe was afraid\n\nto tell.\n\n           {¶7} Mother found Mary Doe in her closet, crying and afraid. It took Mother\n\ntwenty minutes to coax Mary Doe from the closet and to ask her what was wrong. Mary\n\nDoe was afraid she would be in trouble. Finally Mary Doe said, “Mommy, don’t make us\n\ngo with Uncle Michael anymore.” She told her mother appellant had been kissing her on\n\nthe lips and putting his hands down her pants, and she was afraid. At trial Mary Doe\n\ntestified appellant touched her on her “private part” under her clothes and indicated her\n\nvagina. She said the last time it happened was the last time she saw appellant, i.e.\n\nDecember 30.\n\n           {¶8} Mother asked Jane Doe if this happened to her as well and Jane Doe said\n\nyes. At trial, Jane Doe testified appellant touched her “boobs,” “pee-pee,” and “butt,” over\n\nher clothes and under her clothes. Jane Doe also testified to digital penetration. Jane\n\nDoe testified appellant told her not to tell anyone and bought her things if she allowed him\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     4\n\n\nto touch her, including the Monster High doll. When Jane Doe learned the same things\n\nwere happening to Mary Doe, she felt it was time to disclose to their mother.\n\n       {¶9} Mary Doe testified the abuse was ongoing until the night she and Jane Doe\n\ntold their mother. She and Jane Doe had never discussed the abuse with each other or\n\nwith anyone else until the night of the disclosure.\n\n       {¶10} That night, Mother told her boyfriend and also her Aunt, appellant’s sister.\n\nAunt is a nurse and told Mother to take the girls to the hospital right away. Mother took\n\nthem to a hospital the next morning.\n\n       {¶11} In the meantime, Aunt, appellant, and their spouses went to Delaware\n\nCounty Children’s Services and reported that the girls were being molested.1\n\n       {¶12} A pediatric SANE nurse examined both children at Nationwide Children’s\n\nHospital and collected rape kits. The nurse testified both exams were “normal” and she\n\ndid not observe any genital trauma to either victim. She testified these findings were\n\nneither unusual nor unexpected in light of the allegations of touching and digital\n\npenetration.\n\n       {¶13} A forensic analyst from B.C.I. testified about examination of the rape kits for\n\nD.N.A. evidence. No semen was found and no foreign D.N.A. was located on either\n\nvictim. The analyst noted a tiny amount of male D.N.A. was found on a swab taken from\n\nJane Doe’s breasts and a tiny amount of male D.N.A. was found on a swab of amylase\n\nfound in Mary Doe’s underwear. The presence of the male chromosome was noted but\n\nthe sample was too miniscule to provide any basis for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n1The relatives named the perpetrator as Mother’s boyfriend Robert Flores, an allegation\nwhich was alluded to at trial.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                   5\n\n\n       {¶14} A forensic interviewer from Nationwide Children’s Hospital spoke to both\n\ngirls and testified at trial. She said Jane Doe reported sexual abuse by appellant at\n\nGrandmother’s house: appellant touched her breasts more than once, rubbed his penis\n\non her vagina with clothes on more than once, and put his finger inside her vagina. Jane\n\nDoe said the last incident occurred the last time she saw appellant, or Monday, December\n\n29, 2014.\n\n       {¶15} Mary Doe also disclosed sexual abuse by appellant to the forensic\n\ninterviewer: appellant touched, rubbed, and hurt her vagina, on top of clothes and with\n\nbare skin, and put his finger inside her vagina. It happened many times but the most\n\nrecent occurrence was the last time she saw appellant, or Tuesday, December 30, 2014.\n\n       {¶16} Detective Daniel Madden of the Delaware City Police Department\n\ninvestigated the allegations which were reported to him via Grady Memorial Hospital.\n\nMadden instructed Mother to take the girls to Nationwide Children’s Hospital and she\n\ncomplied. Madden advised Children’s Services of the allegations and learned appellant\n\nand his family had come to Children’s Services earlier the same day to report the abuse,\n\nalthough they named a different perpetrator.\n\n       {¶17} Madden called appellant and appellant volunteered to come in to speak to\n\nhim. Madden testified appellant said he played a “grandfatherly” role with the girls.\n\nMadden asked why the girls would make up sexual abuse allegations and appellant said\n\nmaybe someone else did it. Madden noted appellant made a strange comment about\n\ntelling “her” that if it was a boy and had a penis, it “leaked.” Madden observed appellant\n\nhad a very dry mouth throughout the interview which the detective interpreted as an\n\nindication appellant was lying. Appellant told Madden he and Aunt went to Children’s\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                    6\n\n\nServices to start an investigation because his sister (Aunt) thinks something else was\n\ngoing on.\n\n       {¶18} When Madden asked directly if he ever touched the girls’ breasts, vaginal\n\nareas, or buttocks, appellant denied the abuse and said if those touches happened they\n\nwere unintentional in the bathtub or when the girls would jump on him. Madden also\n\nconfronted appellant with the specific allegation that he kissed Mary Doe on the lips.\n\nAppellant said Mary Doe always kisses him on the lips; he said he has tried to stop her\n\nfrom doing it but she persisted.\n\n       {¶19} Madden testified he found it strange that although appellant has children of\n\nhis own, the desktop photograph on his cell phone screen was of Jane and Mary Doe.\n\n       {¶20} Appellant testified on his own behalf at trial. He described many photos and\n\nvideos of Jane, Mary, and John Doe on his cell phone; in some of the photos the girls are\n\ndressed up in costumes or makeup, and in some the children are sleeping. Appellant\n\nsaid the children did not ask to have their photos taken but did not object. In one video,\n\nhe described Mary Doe “shaking [her] behind” and said it made him very uncomfortable\n\nand he had to correct the behavior. He said he observed this type of behavior “frequently.”\n\n       {¶21} Several of appellant’s friends and family members testified on his behalf at\n\ntrial, including Aunt and Grandmother, among others. The witnesses testified they did\n\nnot believe appellant had the propensity to molest children and described various\n\ndevelopmental issues with the children and problems with Mother’s parenting. The\n\nwitnesses insinuated that the children’s behavioral problems were consistent with sexual\n\nabuse but that Mother’s boyfriend was the perpetrator instead of appellant.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     7\n\n\n         {¶22} Appellant was charged by indictment as follows: Count I, rape of a child\n\nunder the age of 13 [Jane Doe], a felony of the first degree pursuant to R.C.\n\n2907.02(A)(1)(b); Count II, forcible rape of Jane Doe pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), a\n\nfelony of the first degree; Count III, gross sexual imposition against a child under the age\n\nof 13 [Jane Doe], a felony of the third degree pursuant to R.C. 2907.05(A)(4); Count IV,\n\nforcible gross sexual imposition against Jane Doe, a felony of the fourth degree pursuant\n\nto R.C. 2907.05(A)(1); Count V, rape of a child under the age of 13 [Mary Doe], noting\n\nMary Doe was under the age of 10, a felony of the first degree pursuant to R.C.\n\n2907.02(A)(1)(b), a felony of the first degree; Count VI, forcible rape of Mary Doe pursuant\n\nto R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), a felony of the first degree; Count VII, gross sexual imposition\n\nagainst a child under the age of 13 [Mary Doe], a felony of the third degree pursuant to\n\nR.C. 2907.05(A)(4); and Count VIII, forcible gross sexual imposition against Mary Doe, a\n\nfelony of the fourth degree pursuant to R.C. 2907.05(A)(1).\n\n         {¶23} The indictment states that Counts I through IV arose on or around\n\nDecember 29, 2014, and Counts V through VIII arose on or around December 30, 2014.\n\n         {¶24} Appellant entered pleas of not guilty. He moved to sever trial of the counts\n\nrelative to each of the two victims; appellee responded in opposition. The motion to sever\n\nproceeded to oral argument and was denied by judgment entry dated March 27, 2015.2\n\n         {¶25} On July 23, 2015, appellant moved the trial court to call Robert Flores,\n\nMother’s boyfriend, as a court’s witness pursuant to Evid.R. 614.          Appellee filed a\n\nresponse in opposition.\n\n\n\n\n2   A number of other motions not relevant to this appeal were filed by both parties.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                         8\n\n\n       {¶26} On August 5, 2015, the trial court overruled appellant’s motion to call Robert\n\nFlores as a court’s witness, noting “[t]he defense has no good faith basis to believe Mr.\n\nFlores is involved in any way with molesting the girls except for the allegations coming\n\nforth after he entered their lives” and “[t]he Court does not feel it is necessary * * * to call\n\nMr. Flores because there has been no showing he has any information material to the\n\noffenses.”\n\n       {¶27} Appellee also filed a motion in limine asking the trial court to prohibit\n\nappellant from introducing evidence of Flores’ rape conviction involving a victim described\n\nas an “adult ex-girlfriend.”\n\n       {¶28} The case proceeded to trial by jury. Appellant moved for judgment of\n\nacquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A) at the conclusion of appellee’s evidence and at the\n\nconclusion of all of the evidence; the motions were overruled. On August 31, 2015,\n\nappellant was found not guilty upon Counts I and II [rape of Jane Doe]; guilty upon Counts\n\nIII and IV [gross sexual imposition against Jane Doe]; and guilty of Counts VII and VIII\n\n[gross sexual imposition against Mary Doe]. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous\n\nverdict upon Counts V and VI [rape of Mary Doe].\n\n       {¶29} On September 15, 2015, appellant filed a motion to set aside the verdicts\n\nand enter judgments of acquittal or in the alternative a motion for new trial. Appellee\n\nresponded with a motion in opposition.         On September 25, 2015, appellant filed a\n\n“Defendant’s Proffer of Evidence” excluded at trial.\n\n       {¶30} Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court found Counts IV and VIII to\n\nbe allied offenses of similar import and thus proceeded to sentence appellant upon\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                  9\n\n\nCounts III and VII. The trial court imposed two concurrent terms of 24 months in prison.\n\nAppellant was found to be a Tier II sex offender.\n\n       {¶31} On October 1, 2015, by judgment entry, the trial court sustained appellant’s\n\nmotion for acquittal as to Counts V and VI [rape of Mary Doe] but otherwise overruled the\n\nmotion to set aside the verdict and motion for new trial.\n\n       {¶32} Appellant now appeals from the judgment entry of sentence and from the\n\njudgment entry denying the motion to set aside the verdict and for new trial.\n\n       {¶33} Appellant raises six assignments of error:\n\n                              ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n       {¶34} “I. THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED APPELLANT’S FEDERAL AND STATE\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL, AND CRIM.R. 14, BY REUSING TO\n\nSEVER THE COUNTS RELATING TO SEPARATE VICTIMS.”\n\n       {¶35} “II.

Evid.R. 401. The next step is to consider\n\n              whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented\n\n              to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in\n\n              conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented\n\n              for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B). The\n\n              third step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts\n\n              evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\n\n              prejudice. See Evid.R. 403.\n\n                     State v.

The nature of the allegations is similar:\n\ntouching over and under the clothing over time. The final incidents occurred within 24\n\nhours of each other, with each victim isolated by appellant and kept alone with him.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     15\n\n\nAppellant took each victim to a favorite restaurant consistent with allegations he groomed\n\nand rewarded the victims for acts of abuse.\n\n       {¶51} Having reviewed the substantial record of this case, we are convinced the\n\nevidence against both victims was not presented to prove appellant’s character in order\n\nto show activity in conformity therewith. Appellant told Madden he may have touched the\n\ngirls accidentally in the bathtub or when they climbed on him to play; the similar\n\ncircumstances of the offenses against both victims defeats this explanation and points to\n\nappellant’s motive and intent. Appellant and his witnesses implied the girls’ behavioral\n\nproblems were consistent with sexual abuse but pointed to a different perpetrator; the\n\nrelated allegations involving two victims point to appellant’s identity as the perpetrator.\n\n       {¶52} From our review of the evidence, we find: 1) the acts were against family\n\nmembers, 2) the acts occurred when the children were isolated with appellant after he\n\nasked to be alone with them and 3) the allegations of touching over and under the clothing\n\nwere similar.

Id.\n\n       {¶53} The third step in the Williams analysis is whether the probative value of\n\neach incident is outweighed by the prejudice risked in its admission. Williams, supra, 2-\n\n2012-Ohio-5695 at ¶ 20. Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in\n\nan improper basis for a jury decision. State v.

The evidence appellant points to consists of the testimony of his family\n\nmembers which premised upon rumor, supposition, and innuendo. The sole established\n\nfact against Flores is that he has a 2004 conviction for attempted rape against an adult\n\nfemale victim described by appellee as an ex-girlfriend.\n\n       {¶61} First, appellant argues the trial court should have called Flores as a court’s\n\nwitness “so that the defense could impeach Flores with his prior conviction for attempted\n\nrape and status as a registered sex offender.” (Brief, 24). Ohio Evid. R. 614(A) states\n\n“[t]he court may, on its own motion or at the suggestion of a party, call witnesses, and all\n\nparties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called.”\n\n       {¶62} At the hearing on appellant’s motion, appellant presented evidence Flores\n\nwas convicted of attempted rape in 2004 and is a registered sex offender.

Defense trial counsel stated he “assumed” Mother\n\nwould have explained Flores’ status as a sex offender to her children and told them to\n\n“mind [ ] themselves” around him. (T. 8/4/2015, 6-7). Counsel argued this assumption is\n\nrelevant as follows:\n\n                              One of the questions the jury is likely to ask themselves\n\n                       is why would girls of this age have knowledge of these\n\n                       subjects but for the fact that they engaged in this behavior.\n\n                              This goes to a source of knowledge, your Honor. That\n\n                       conversation would have provided them information about the\n\n                       importance of telling somebody if somebody—if you’re being\n\n                       touched and what the consequences of that are.\n\n                       T. 8/4/2015, 7.\n\n       {¶63} The trial court questioned counsel whether the true purpose of calling Flores\n\nas a court’s witness was to accuse him of being the perpetrator of the abuse against the\n\ngirls and pointed out that calling Flores as a witness bore no relationship to the girls’\n\n“knowledge of sex abuse.” The following conversation took place:\n\n                              [DEFENSE COUNSEL:] * * * *.\n\n                              We’ll be able to essentially impeach his testimony\n\n              extrinsically just through knowledge of other people, and that goes\n\n              to his believability when I do ask him that ultimate question.\n\n                              Are you the person that did this and he says, no, if he’s\n\n              lied about six other things, Judge, the jury’s going to have the\n\n              opportunity to weigh that.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                    19\n\n\n                            And I think that’s an important factor for them to weigh\n\n              when there’s a man who’s been sleeping in the same house, taking\n\n              care of these girls for at least six weeks, and really longer than that,\n\n              he’s been a part of their lives for 11 months, he was their primary\n\n              caregiver for six weeks.\n\n                            With that much interaction with the girls immediately\n\n              before these allegations, I think that’s an important piece for the jury\n\n              to know.\n\n                            * * * *.\n\n              THE COURT: So do you have any good-faith basis to believe that he\n\n     molested these girls or are you just putting him on the stand as a strawman out\n\n     there?\n\n              [DEFENSE COUNSEL:] He’s not a strawman, sir. But he has—he’s—he\n\n     is the change in the girls’ lives.       That’s my good-faith basis is that almost\n\n     immediately prior to these allegations coming out is when he’s the person that\n\n     starts babysitting them.\n\n              [Appellant] had been part of their life for two years, and then six weeks we\n\n     have this happen.\n\n              I have other—I have other witnesses who will testify to change in their\n\n     behavior during that six weeks.\n\n              Do I have any—do I have a video or a confession or statement that says\n\n     he’s the one that did this? No, sir.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                     20\n\n\n              But I have—I have quite a bit of other information that really raises some\n\n       red flags, and I think those are red flags that the jury’s entitled to hear and judge\n\n       for themselves.\n\n              * * * *.\n\n       T. 8/4/2015, 16-18.\n\n       {¶64} The trial court deferred ruling upon the motion to call Flores as a court’s\n\nwitness but later denied the motion. The trial court also provisionally granted appellee’s\n\nmotion in limine prohibiting mention of the attempted rape conviction. (T. I., 19-21.)\n\n       {¶65} Flores’ criminal conviction is not relevant and cross-examination of him in\n\nan attempt to paint him as the perpetrator of the crimes is not within the parameters of\n\nEvid.R. 614(A). “A trial court possesses the authority in the exercise of sound discretion\n\nto call individuals as witnesses of the court.” State v.

The attenuated reason appellant cited for calling Flores as\n\na witness (that Mother may have spoken to the girls about his past, thereby explaining\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                   21\n\n\nhow the girls are aware of sexual abuse terms) has no “tendency to make the existence\n\nof any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\n\nprobable than it would be without the evidence.” Arnold, supra, 2010-Ohio-5379 at ¶ 47.\n\nThe trial court noted appellant’s underlying purpose was to cast Flores as a “strawman”\n\nalternate suspect, and counsel could cite no reason supporting a good-faith belief that\n\nFlores was a credible alternate suspect. Appellant argues the defense theory was that\n\nthe victims were afraid to go home to Mother’s house because they were alone with Flores\n\nthere and he abused them, “like Mother’s previous boyfriends,” but Mother would not\n\nbelieve them. Thus they made false allegations against appellant to gain Mother’s\n\n“attention, sympathy, and protection.” This theory is not supported by the evidence at\n\ntrial.\n\n         {¶67} Appellant further argues he should have been permitted to introduce\n\n“evidence Flores was abusing the girls.” In support of this unsubstantiated allegation,\n\nappellant points to his proffer of evidence at sentencing which consists of an affidavit of\n\nan adult trial witness stating she was sexually assaulted by Flores; an affidavit by\n\nGrandmother stating Jane Doe told her Flores spanked her and Mother lies; and an\n\naffidavit of Aunt stating she told D.J.F.S. she believed Flores “was the perpetrator\n\nbecause he is a convicted sex offender, another young lady had disclosed a sexual\n\nassault to me in which he was the perpetrator and the children’s behavior around him\n\nappears frightened.”\n\n         {¶68} This “evidence” does not support appellant’s allegation Flores perpetrated\n\nthe acts of abuse appellant was charged with committing, nor is such “evidence”\n\nadmissible at appellant’s trial. We note appellant cites no evidentiary basis upon which\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                      22\n\n\nthe information contained in the affidavits would be admissible. The trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in disallowing any of the cited “evidence” at trial.\n\n       {¶69} Appellant’s second and third assignments of error are overruled.\n\n                                               IV., V.\n\n       {¶70} In his fourth and fifth assignments of error, appellant argues he received\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel. We disagree.\n\n       {¶71} To succeed on a claim of ineffectiveness, a defendant must satisfy a two-\n\nprong test. Initially, a defendant must show that trial counsel acted incompetently. See,\n\nStrickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). In assessing such claims,\n\n“a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide\n\nrange of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the\n\npresumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action ‘might be considered\n\nsound trial strategy.’” Id. at 689, citing Michel v. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The question is whether counsel acted “outside the\n\nwide range of professionally competent assistance.” Id. at 690.\n\n       {¶73} Even if a defendant shows that counsel was incompetent, the defendant\n\nmust then satisfy the second prong of the Strickland test. Under this “actual prejudice”\n\nprong, the defendant must show that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                    23\n\n\n       {¶74} Appellant argues trial counsel was ineffective in failing to renew the\n\nargument to sever the counts at the close of all of the evidence. Appellant moved to sever\n\nprior to trial but did not renew the motion at the close of the appellee’s case and at the\n\nconclusion of all evidence. Some Ohio courts have held a failure to renew a motion to\n\nsever constitutes a waiver. State v. Musgrave, 5th Dist. Stark No. 97-CA-0135, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">818067</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2 (Oct. 26, 1998). However, we generally prefer to address this claim on its\n\nmerits as we have done here. Id. Appellant has thus failed to demonstrate that he was\n\nprejudiced by counsel’s failure to renew the motion. See, State v. Hamblin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">153</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988).\n\n       {¶75} Appellant further argues trial counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the\n\n“evidence” described in the proffer earlier in the trial, particularly the claim that Flores\n\nallegedly sexually assaulted an adult. Appellant offers no explanation how this evidence\n\nwould have been admissible during the adult witness’ testimony. As we discussed supra,\n\nthis “evidence” is not relevant or admissible. We thus fail to see how counsel could have\n\napproached introduction of the claims any differently.\n\n       {¶76} Appellant has not demonstrated ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n\nAssignments of error numbers four and five are overruled.\n\n                                              VI.\n\n       {¶77} In his sixth assignment of error, appellant claims cumulative errors in his\n\ntrial deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree.\n\n       {¶78} In State v. Garner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court held pursuant to the cumulative error doctrine “a conviction will be\n\nreversed where the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of the\n\fDelaware County, Case No. 15CAA100080                                                  24\n\n\nconstitutional right to a fair trial even though each of numerous instances of trial court\n\nerror does not individually constitute cause for reversal.”\n\n       {¶79} In the instant case, we do not find multiple instances of harmless error\n\ntriggering the cumulative error doctrine, and appellant's sixth assignment of error is\n\ntherefore overruled.
