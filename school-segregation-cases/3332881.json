In 1997, West Feliciana Parish passed a one-mill tax to be divided 60-40, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  \". . . with forty percent (40%) of the tax revenues to be dedicated to the Audubon Regional Library and its branches, jointly with the Parish of St. Helena and the Parish of East Feliciana and sixty percent (60%) of the tax revenues to be dedicated to the West Feliciana Parish branch of the Audubon Regional Library\".</p></blockquote>\n<p>You further advised that from 1997 through April, 2002, the 60% proceeds were forwarded by the Parish Police Jury to the System, which then segregated the 60% proceeds from the tax revenues collected from the other parishes.  The Police Jury has now advised that, despite this history, it never intended that the 60% be under the control and budgetary oversight of the System.</p>\n<p>Your question is: does the 1997 Parish tax proposition require budgetary oversight and approval by the Parish Police Jury and/or by the System, for the expenditure of the 60%?</p>\n<p>The 1997 Parish tax proposition authorizes the levy of a one mill tax by <em>the Parish</em>.  The Parish, not the System, is the entity which levies the tax.  The Parish can only use the proceeds for the purposes set forth in the proposition as the proceeds of a special tax constitutes a trust fund to be used exclusively for the objects and purposes for which the tax was levied. R.S. <cross_reference>39:704</cross_reference>.

The Supplemental Agreement further ratifies, confirms and approves the appointment of a Board of Commissioners as the governing authority to promote, maintain, support and operate the Audubon Regional Library.</p>\n<p>R.S. <cross_reference>25:217</cross_reference> authorizes the governing authority of a parish to submit to the property taxpayers a proposition to vote a special tax for the maintenance and support of such public library and its branches.

In all cases where a public library is jointly established and maintained, each parish concerned shall contribute its pro rata or equitable share of the costs and expenses.  R.S. <cross_reference>25:220</cross_reference>\nprovides:</p>\n<blockquote><p>  \"<strong>The expenses or costs of maintenance of a public</strong> <strong>library</strong> established under this Part, including the salaries of librarian, assistants, and other employees as well as all other incidental expenses, <strong>shall be</strong> <strong>paid monthly by the governing authority establishing</strong> <strong>the library</strong>, <strong>upon the approval of such expenses and</strong> <strong>maintenance costs by the board of control</strong> <strong>of such</strong> <strong>library</strong>, out of the funds specially budgeted from the general fund for library purposes and, in default thereof, out of the special taxes voted, levied and collected by the governing authority for the library's support and maintenance.  <strong>The board of control may</strong> <strong>delegate to the president or one of its members the</strong> <strong>duty of approving such monthly expenses and</strong> <strong>maintenance costs</strong>.\"  (Emphasis added)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Based upon the foregoing, it is the opinion of this office that the expenses or costs of maintenance of the Audubon Regional Library System, specifically the branch located in West Feliciana Parish, including the salaries of librarian, assistants, and other employees as well as all other incidental expenses, may be paid monthly by the West Feliciana Police Jury, upon the approval of such expenses and maintenance costs by the System's Board of Commissioners.
