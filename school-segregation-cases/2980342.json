Ross\n\nMcKnight, Throckmorton Bancshares, Inc. (Throckmorton), Olney Bancshares of\n\nTexas, Inc. (Olney), and the remaining appellees listed above. Lindley contends\n\nthat the trial court erred by denying her motion for summary judgment, granting\n\nappellees‘ motions for summary judgment, making allegedly incorrect rulings on\n\nthe parties‘ objections to summary judgment evidence, and awarding more than\n\n$200,000 in attorney‘s fees to appellees. We affirm.\n\n                               Background Facts\n\n      Throckmorton and Olney are holding companies that purchase and own\n\naffiliated or unaffiliated banks.   McKnight is the chairman of the board and\n\npresident of Throckmorton, and he is the president of Olney. He owns stock in\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fboth corporations. Daws was one of the initial shareholders of Olney (investing\n\n$25,000), which was formed to acquire the First National Bank of Olney and later\n\nacquired seven other banks. She also owned significant stock in Throckmorton,\n\nwhich owns only the First National Bank of Throckmorton. Lindley is Daws‘s\n\nniece.\n\n         McKnight and Daws are distant relatives. Daws‘s husband, Jim Bob, was\n\nonce the chairman of the First National Bank of Throckmorton. McKnight has\n\nlived in the city of Throckmorton his entire life except when he attended college.\n\nHe was raised next door to the Dawses and lived close to them until he went to\n\ncollege. He considered them to be friends.\n\n         In 1996, Throckmorton and Olney considered conversions to S\n\ncorporations.1    In November of that year, McKnight sent a letter to Olney‘s\n\nshareholders stating that to complete the conversion, they needed to all agree to\n\nit through an IRS election form and a shareholders‘ agreement.\n\n         The Throckmorton shareholders‘ agreement, which was revised and\n\napproved by the corporation‘s attorney, Richard Dale Craig, contains the\n\nfollowing provisions, among others:\n\n\n         1\n       See generally 26 U.S.C.A. §§ 1361–1363 (West 2011); see also Thomas\nv. Thomas, 738 S.W.2d 342, 344 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ\ndenied) (explaining that Subchapter S status ―provides an alternate method to tax\nthe corporation‘s income‖). A disclosure memorandum sent by Olney to its\nshareholders in November 1996 explains that a Subchapter S election allows a\ncorporation‘s income to be passed through to shareholders‘ individual income tax\nreturns.\n\n\n                                        4\n\f                  SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT\n\n      THIS AGREEMENT made effective the 1st day of January,\n1997, by and among Throckmorton Bancshares, Inc., a Texas\ncorporation (the ―Corporation‖) and the undersigned shareholders of\nthe Corporation and their respective spouses (the ―Original\nShareholders‖).\n\n      ....\n\n      WHEREAS, the Corporation intends to file an election to be\ntaxed as an S corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended with the consent of the Original Shareholders; and\n\n      WHEREAS, the Original Shareholders, acting for themselves\nand for all persons who subsequently may become shareholders of\nthe Corporation (the ―Shareholders‖), and the Corporation wish to\nkeep the election in force until it is revoked pursuant to this\nAgreement.\n\n     NOW, THEREFORE, the Original Shareholders and the\nCorporation agree as follows:\n\n        Section 1. Voluntary Transfer of Stock. No Shareholder shall\ntransfer stock of the Corporation by sale, gift, assignment, pledge, or\nother voluntary disposition or encumbrance unless he shall have\nprovided the Corporation, at least thirty (30) days prior to the\nproposed transfer, with a written statement (the ―Notice‖) regarding\nthe identity of the proposed transferee sufficient to satisfy the\nCorporation that (a) the proposed transferee is an eligible S\ncorporation shareholder and (b) the proposed transfer will not cause\nthe record number of Shareholders of the Corporation to exceed\nthirty-two (32). Such proposed transfer may be effected by the\nShareholder only if the Corporation approves the transfer in\naccordance with Section 3 below. Any transfer of stock of the\nCorporation that is not described in this Section 1 as a voluntary\ntransfer shall be considered an involuntary transfer subject to the\nprovisions of Section 2 below.\n\n     Section 2. Involuntary Transfer of Stock.       In the event any\nShareholder:\n\n      (a) dies;\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\f            ....\n\n      and, as a result of such event, the stock of the Corporation owned\n      by that Shareholder is subject to being transferred, . . . the\n      Shareholder shall be deemed, when the identity of the proposed\n      transferee is established, to have given Notice, as defined under\n      Section 1 hereof, except that the Corporation shall not be deemed to\n      have received such Notice until the Corporation has actual\n      knowledge of the event and the identity of the proposed transferee.\n\n              Section 3. Approval by the Corporation. Within twenty (20)\n      days of the receipt of a Notice required by Section 1 hereof, the\n      Corporation shall advise the Shareholder who provided the Notice\n      whether the Corporation approves the transfer. The Corporation\n      may, in its sole discretion, approve or disapprove any proposed\n      transfer, except that the Corporation shall withhold its approval of\n      any proposed transfer if (a) it would cause or reasonably could\n      cause the Corporation‘s S status to terminate or (b) it would cause\n      the record number of Shareholders of the Corporation to exceed\n      thirty-two (32).[2]\n\n             Section 4. Effect of Noncompliance. In the event of any\n      purported or attempted transfer of stock that does not comply with\n      the provisions of this agreement, the purported transfer shall be void\n      and the purported transferee shall not be deemed to be a\n      Shareholder of the Corporation and shall not be entitled to receive a\n      new stock certificate or any dividends or other distributions on or\n      with respect to the stock.\n\n             Section 5. Redemption of Shares. If a Shareholder attempts\n      to transfer stock of the Corporation in a manner that does not comply\n      with the provisions of this Agreement, the shares purported to be\n      transferred shall, at the Corporation‘s option, be deemed to be\n      redeemed immediately before the occurrence of the attempted\n      transfer. If the Corporation exercises its option to redeem shares,\n      the amount to be paid therefor shall be their book value . . . as of the\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       The number of shareholders was limited to thirty-two because a state law\nprovision would have included executive officers‘ salaries in the calculation of\nfranchise tax if there were more than thirty-five shareholders.\n\n\n                                         6\n\f      end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the redemption . . . ,\n      which amount shall be payable in cash.[3]\n\n      Daws signed both corporations‘ shareholders‘ agreements.            McKnight\n\nasserted through an affidavit that the goals of the transfer restrictions were to\n\nprotect the corporations‘ anticipated Subchapter S status, minimize franchise\n\ntaxes, promote ownership by shareholders who contributed to the success of the\n\nbanks owned by the corporations ―in some way other than indirect ownership,‖\n\nand comply with various ―federal and state banking requirements, which may\n\nfrom time to time affect bank ownership.‖4\n\n      All of the corporations‘ shareholders had to consent to Subchapter S status\n\nfor the conversions to occur.5 Craig explained that new legislation had been\n\npassed that permitted financial institutions to become S corporations effective in\n\n1997. He also said that a corporation could not qualify for Subchapter S status if\n\n\n\n      3\n        The Olney shareholders‘ agreement contains provisions that are\nsubstantially similar to those in the Throckmorton agreement. The reference in\nsection three of the Throckmorton agreement to the mandated disapproval of a\ntransfer if ―it would cause the record number of Shareholders of the Corporation\nto exceed thirty-two‖ is changed in the Olney agreement to state that disapproval\nmust occur if ―it would be a violation of Section 7.05(b) of the Corporation‘s\nBylaws.‖ That section, as effective on December 1, 1996, states that except on\nthe written consent of the Olney board, the corporation‘s number of shareholders\ncould not exceed fifty.\n      4\n       As Lindley argued in the trial court, the corporations‘ bylaws do not dictate\nthat the corporations‘ shareholders be customers of the corporations‘ banks or\notherwise contribute to them. Nor do the bylaws require shareholders to be\nresidents of the counties in which the corporations or banks are located.\n      5\n       See 26 U.S.C.A. § 1362(a)(2).\n\n\n                                         7\n\fit had more than seventy-five shareholders.6 Craig conceded that federal law\n\ndoes       not   require   S   corporations   to   have   shareholders‘   agreements.\n\nHe explained, however, that such agreements are helpful to protect Subchapter\n\nS status because the agreements may prevent shareholders from exceeding\n\nseventy-five or from transferring stock to an impermissible shareholder, such as\n\nanother corporation. Craig said,\n\n             It‘s extremely easy to have an inadvertent termination of an\n       S election. And one of the reasons that you have a shareholders[‘]\n       agreement is to help put you in the best position to argue with the\n       IRS that there wasn‘t an impermissible transfer, that there are\n       contractual restrictions that prevent that. . . .\n\n              . . . [I]t‘s never a position that one wants to be in to ask for\n       forgiveness from the IRS.\n\n       Daws died on June 25, 2000 (years after signing the shareholders‘\n\nagreements), at which time she owned over 25% of the shares of Throckmorton‘s\n\nstock, making her the corporation‘s largest shareholder. She was a minority\n\nshareholder in Olney. She also had a checking account with the First National\n\nBank of Throckmorton that contained approximately $100,000.               Daws‘s will\n\nnamed Lindley as independent executor and bequeathed all of the residuary\n\nestate (including almost all of the stock) to her.\n\n       In August 2000, Lindley was officially appointed as the independent\n\nexecutor of Daws‘s estate, and a Wichita County court admitted Daws‘s will to\n\n\n       6\n      Today, an S corporation may have up to 100 shareholders.                See id.\n§ 1361(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n                                              8\n\fprobate.   During meetings occurring that same month, McKnight advised the\n\ncorporations‘ boards of directors that the corporations had received a copy of\n\nDaws‘s will on July 26, 2000. The minutes of the Throckmorton meeting state\n\nthat McKnight noted that ―under the terms of the Shareholders[‘] Agreement, Mrs.\n\nDaws‘[s] death constituted an ‗involuntary transfer‘ of her stock in the\n\nCorporation,‖ and the company had the ―sole discretion to approve or\n\ndisapprove‖ the attempted transfer. The minutes then explain that the directors\n\nrecognized\n\n      the benefit to the Corporation and its subsidiary bank of having local\n      ownership and the support which the local shareholders gave to the\n      bank. It was further noted that while the number of the Corporation‘s\n      shareholders was less than the maximum permitted under the\n      Corporation‘s Bylaws, it was still desirable not to increase the\n      number of shareholders.\n\n            . . . It was . . . recommended that the Board of Directors\n      disapprove the transfer to [Lindley], and that the stock be redeemed\n      in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders[‘] Agreement.\n\n      Thus, the Throckmorton board disapproved the transfer of ninety-two\n\nshares of stock to Lindley and voted that those shares be redeemed through a\n\npayment of the book value of the stock as of December 31, 1999.7 The Olney\n\nboard took a similar action as reflected in minutes from its August 2000 meeting;\n\nthe minutes state that corporation redeemed 625 shares of Olney stock that\n\nDaws attempted to transfer to Lindley.\n\n\n      7\n      Lindley still has the original certificate for Daws‘s Throckmorton shares.\nShe says that she ―refused to return it after being notified in October 2000‖ that\nThrockmorton had redeemed the shares.\n\n                                         9\n\f         On August 11, 2000, Bruce Crum, an attorney for the corporations, sent a\n\nletter to Lindley informing her of the disapproved transfer and redemption of the\n\nshares. Crum expressed that he included copies of audited financial statements\n\nfor the corporations and that he also sent the letter to Daws‘s estate‘s counsel.\n\nTen days later, Crum sent a letter to the estate‘s counsel that enclosed the\n\ncorporations‘ bylaws and the minutes of the meetings that had occurred that\n\nmonth.\n\n         Lindley sued McKnight, Throckmorton, Olney, and Throckmorton‘s and\n\nOlney‘s shareholders.8            Lindley asserted that appellees had implemented\n\nunenforceable shareholders‘ agreements. She sought declarations, under the\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA),9 that the agreements were\n\nunreasonable and void and that appellees had failed to comply with them. She\n\nalso alleged that McKnight had breached a fiduciary duty to Daws by failing to\n\ndisclose the legal effect of the agreements upon her estate, that appellees were\n\nliable       for   common   law    fraud   and    statutory fraud   based   on   alleged\n\nmisrepresentations about the necessity and legal effect of the agreements, and\n\n\n         8\n        Lindley referred to McKnight, Throckmorton, and Olney as ―Defendants‖;\nshe referred to the shareholders as ―Respondents.‖ She included some\nappellees in her original petition and added others to the suit at a later time; for\nsimplicity, we will refer to the parties that Lindley sued in December 2000 as\n―appellees,‖ and we will use the term ―appellees‖ to refer to actions taken by\nMcKnight, Throckmorton, and Olney even if the other appellees did not explicitly\njoin the actions.\n         9\n         See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. §§ 37.001–.011 (West 2008).\n\n\n                                             10\n\fthat appellees breached section three of the agreements by failing to reject the\n\nstock transfers to her within twenty days of receiving knowledge that she was the\n\nproposed transferee.10 Lindley sought compensatory damages for the difference\n\nbetween the book value and fair market value of Daws‘s stock and for dividends\n\nand distributions on the stock to which she claimed to be entitled.11 She also\n\nasked for exemplary damages and attorney‘s fees.\n\n      Appellees filed answers that included general denials12 and defenses.\n\nAppellees sought declaratory relief about the validity of the shareholders‘\n\nagreements, asserting that they were reasonably drafted to keep local ownership\n\nand ensure the viability of independent community banks. Appellees also asked\n\nthe trial court to award attorney‘s fees.\n\n      Approximately five years after filing the suit, Lindley filed a motion for\n\npartial summary judgment on her claim that the agreements were void as a\n\n      10\n        Lindley said in an affidavit that Bryan Robertson Key, the secretary of\nThrockmorton and president of the First National Bank of Throckmorton, read\nDaws‘s will. Lindley asserts that the corporations received notice of her identity\nas the proposed transferee of Daws‘s stock when Key read the will and that the\ncorporations improperly rejected the transfer more than twenty days later.\n      11\n       In her pleading, Lindley did not specify the amount of damages that she\nrequested.\n      12\n        In his original answer, McKnight specifically denied that he visited Daws\nin a hospital ―or did anything to cause her to sign the Shareholders[‘]\nAgreements.‖ Lindley testified in a deposition that McKnight visited Daws in\n1996 to obtain Daws‘s signature on ―papers‖; McKnight testified that he visited\nher in December of that year to obtain a proxy so that her Throckmorton shares\ncould be voted, but he did not recall discussing specific terms of the\nshareholders‘ agreements with her at that time.\n\n\n                                            11\n\fmatter of law because they unreasonably restricted the transfer of stock.\n\nAppellees responded to Lindley‘s motion and filed a no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment on Lindley‘s claims. Appellees also filed a traditional motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment on their affirmative defenses. Lindley responded to\n\nboth of appellees‘ motions. With leave of court, appellees filed supplements to\n\ntheir traditional motion for summary judgment; the supplements contended,\n\namong other arguments, that Lindley was estopped from challenging the\n\nshareholders‘ agreements.\n\n      The trial court denied Lindley‘s motion for partial summary judgment and\n\ngranted appellees‘ motions for summary judgment. Lindley brought this appeal.\n\n                         Summary Judgment Standards\n\n      We review a summary judgment de novo. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim,\n\n315 S.W.3d 860, 862 (Tex. 2010). We consider the evidence presented in the\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmovant, crediting evidence favorable to the\n\nnonmovant if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding evidence contrary to the\n\nnonmovant unless reasonable jurors could not. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp\n\nAdvisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009). We indulge every\n\nreasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the nonmovant‘s favor. 20801,\n\nInc. v. Parker, 249 S.W.3d 392, 399 (Tex. 2008). We must consider whether\n\nreasonable and fair-minded jurors could differ in their conclusions in light of all of\n\nthe evidence presented. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Spates, 186 S.W.3d 566,\n\n568 (Tex. 2006); City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822–24 (Tex. 2005).\n\n\n                                         12\n\f      When both parties move for summary judgment and the trial court grants\n\none motion and denies the other, the reviewing court should review both parties‘\n\nsummary judgment evidence and determine all questions presented.            Mann\n\nFrankfort, 289 S.W.3d at 848; see Myrad Props., Inc. v. Lasalle Bank Nat’l Ass’n,\n\n300 S.W.3d 746, 753 (Tex. 2009). When a party moves for both a traditional and\n\na no-evidence summary judgment, we generally first review the trial court‘s\n\nsummary judgment under no-evidence standards.           See Ford Motor Co. v.\n\nRidgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex. 2004); All Am. Tel., Inc. v. USLD\n\nCommc’ns, Inc., 291 S.W.3d 518, 526 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2009, pet.\n\ndenied).   ―When the trial court does not specify the basis for its summary\n\njudgment, the appealing party must show it is error to base it on any ground\n\nasserted in the motion. The appellate court must affirm the summary judgment if\n\nany one of the movant‘s theories has merit.‖ Star-Telegram, Inc. v. Doe, 915\n\nS.W.2d 471, 473 (Tex. 1995) (citations omitted).\n\nTraditional motions for summary judgment for or against claims or\ndefenses\n\n      In a traditional summary judgment case, the issue on appeal is whether the\n\nmovant met the summary judgment burden by establishing that no genuine issue\n\nof material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); Mann Frankfort, 289 S.W.3d at 848. The summary\n\njudgment will be affirmed only if the record establishes that the movant has\n\nconclusively proved all essential elements of the movant‘s cause of action or\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\faffirmative defense. City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d\n\n671, 678 (Tex. 1979); see Chau v. Riddle, 254 S.W.3d 453, 455 (Tex. 2008).\n\nIf uncontroverted evidence is from an interested witness, it does nothing more\n\nthan raise a fact issue unless it is clear, positive and direct, otherwise credible\n\nand free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been readily\n\ncontroverted. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); Morrison v. Christie, 266 S.W.3d 89, 92\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2008, no pet.).\n\nNo-evidence motions for summary judgment\n\n      After an adequate time for discovery, the party without the burden of proof\n\nmay, without presenting evidence, move for summary judgment on the ground\n\nthat there is no evidence to support an essential element of the nonmovant‘s\n\nclaim or defense. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). The motion must specifically state the\n\nelements for which there is no evidence. Id.; Timpte Indus., Inc. v. Gish, 286\n\nS.W.3d 306, 310 (Tex. 2009). The trial court must grant the motion unless the\n\nnonmovant produces summary judgment evidence that raises a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i); Hamilton v. Wilson, 249 S.W.3d 425,\n\n426 (Tex. 2008).    If the nonmovant brings forward more than a scintilla of\n\nprobative evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact, then a no-\n\nevidence summary judgment is not proper. Smith v. O’Donnell, 288 S.W.3d 417,\n\n424 (Tex. 2009); King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex.\n\n2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1030 (2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f            Appellees’ No-Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n      In her third issue, Lindley contends that the trial court erred by granting\n\nappellees‘ no-evidence motion for summary judgment on her claims for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty, fraud, statutory fraud, breach of contract, and declaratory\n\njudgment.    Because we will hold below that one of appellees‘ affirmative\n\ndefenses precludes Lindley‘s recovery on her breach of contract and declaratory\n\njudgment claims as a matter of law, we will examine only whether the trial court\n\ncorrectly granted appellees‘ no-evidence summary judgment motion on the\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and statutory fraud claims.\n\nBreach of fiduciary duty\n\n      Lindley pled that McKnight breached a fiduciary duty to Daws by allegedly\n\ncausing her to sign the shareholders‘ agreements. ―The elements of a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty claim are: (1) a fiduciary relationship between the plaintiff and\n\ndefendant, (2) a breach by the defendant of his fiduciary duty to the plaintiff, and\n\n(3) an injury to the plaintiff or benefit to the defendant as a result of the\n\ndefendant‘s breach.‖    Lundy v. Masson, 260 S.W.3d 482, 501 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied). Appellees moved for summary judgment\n\non the basis that there is no evidence of any of these elements.\n\n      The effect of imposing a fiduciary duty is to require the fiduciary party to\n\nplace someone else‘s interests above its own.        Crim Truck & Tractor Co. v.\n\nNavistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 823 S.W.2d 591, 594 (Tex. 1992), superseded by\n\nstatute on other grounds as stated in Subaru of Am., Inc. v. David McDavid\n\n\n                                         15\n\fNissan, Inc., 84 S.W.3d 212, 225–26 (Tex. 2002) (op. on reh‘g). Thus, Texas\n\ncourts are reluctant to recognize fiduciary relationships.          See Jones v.\n\nThompson, No. 08-08-00245-CV, 2010 WL 3157145, at *8 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\nAug. 11, 2010, pet. denied).\n\n      Generally, ―[a] director‘s fiduciary duty runs only to the corporation, not to\n\nindividual shareholders or even to a majority of the shareholders.” Somers ex\n\nrel. EGL, Inc. v. Crane, 295 S.W.3d 5, 11 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009,\n\npet. denied) (quoting Hoggett v. Brown, 971 S.W.2d 472, 488 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1997, pet. denied)); see Redmon v. Griffith, 202 S.W.3d 225,\n\n233 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2006, pet. denied). As we have explained,\n\n             While corporate officers owe fiduciary duties to the corporation\n      they serve, they do not generally owe fiduciary duties to individual\n      shareholders unless a contract or confidential relationship exists\n      between them in addition to the corporate relationship. Due to its\n      extraordinary nature, the law does not recognize a fiduciary\n      relationship lightly. Therefore, whether such a duty exists depends\n      on the circumstances.\n\n             Fiduciary duties may arise from formal and informal\n      relationships and may be created by contract. An informal fiduciary\n      duty may arise from a moral, social, domestic, or purely personal\n      relationship of trust and confidence, generally called a confidential\n      relationship. A confidential relationship exists where influence has\n      been acquired and abused and confidence has been extended and\n      betrayed. A person is justified in placing confidence in the belief that\n      another party will act in his best interest only where he is\n      accustomed to being guided by the judgment or advice of the other\n      party and there exists a long association in a business relationship\n      as well as personal friendship. Thus, the relationship must exist\n      prior to and apart from the agreement that is the basis of the suit.\n      And, although a confidential relationship is ordinarily a question of\n      fact for the jury, it becomes a question of law when the trial court\n      refuses to submit issues on fiduciary duty based on no evidence.\n\n\n                                        16\n\fCotten v.

Cathey, 167\n\nS.W.3d 327, 329, 331 (Tex. 2005) (declining to recognize a fiduciary relationship\n\nwhen, among other facts, the plaintiff and defendant were friends who ate lunch\n\ntogether every day for four years); Crim Truck & Tractor Co., 823 S.W.2d at 595\n\n(explaining that ―[n]either is the fact that the relationship has been a cordial one,\n\nof long duration, evidence of a confidential relationship‖).\n\n      In the trial court, Lindley asserted that an informal, confidential relationship\n\nexisted between McKnight and Daws because\n\n      McKnight lived next door to [Daws] as a child and teenager; he\n      worked as a young man for [Daws‘s] husband . . . ; he assisted\n      [Daws] in business transactions after her husband died . . . ; [Daws]\n      relied upon [McKnight] to act in her best interest; and [McKnight] was\n      a pallbearer at [Daws‘s] funeral.\n\nIn Lindley‘s affidavit, she said,\n\n             I know that [Daws] had a close personal and confidential\n      relationship with [McKnight]. She often spoke of it. I know of several\n      occasions on which [Daws] sought the advice and counsel of\n      [McKnight] in connection with her financial affairs. I know that he\n      advised her in connection with at least one oil and gas lease that\n      she entered into, and that he assisted her in negotiating her royalty\n      interest in that lease. I also know that [McKnight] would seek\n      [Daws‘s] counsel in connection with the affairs of the First National\n      Bank of Throckmorton because she was the largest single\n\n\n                                         17\n\f      shareholder in that bank. At the time that [McKnight] was seeking to\n      form [Olney] in the late 1980‘s [sic], he approached [Daws] and\n      sought to get a substantial investment from her in that company after\n      he had initially inquired as to whether she would oppose his using\n      [Throckmorton] as the entity that would acquire the various failed\n      banks which ultimately became the banks owned by [Olney]. [Daws]\n      refused to let him use Throckmorton for that purpose, but told him\n      that she would invest with him if he acquired those banks using a\n      different entity . . . .\n\n             I know that [Daws] trusted [McKnight] to do the right thing for\n      her, the banks[,] and their shareholders, since [Daws‘s] husband Jim\n      Bob Daws had been the Chairman of the Throckmorton bank for\n      many years prior to [McKnight‘s] ever becoming involved as an\n      employee or officer or shareholder of that bank.\n\n      Appellees argue that ―[c]onsidering only the competent and admissible\n\nevidence . . . , Lindley falls short of raising a material fact issue on the existence\n\nof a fiduciary relationship.‖ In the trial court, appellees objected to statements in\n\nthe paragraphs quoted above on the grounds that various parts of the\n\nparagraphs were based on hearsay, contained conclusory statements, and\n\nviolated rule 601 of the rules of evidence.13      The trial court sustained these\n\nobjections. In her fourth issue, Lindley challenges the trial court‘s decision to\n\nsustain the objections.\n\n      We review a trial court's evidentiary rulings related to a motion for\n\nsummary judgment for an abuse of discretion. Cantu v. Horany, 195 S.W.3d\n\n867, 871 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no pet.); Reynolds v. Murphy, 188 S.W.3d\n\n      13\n          In lawsuits brought by executors, neither party ―shall be allowed to testify\nagainst the others as to any oral statement by the testator . . . unless that\ntestimony to the oral statement is corroborated or unless the witness is called at\nthe trial to testify thereto by the opposite party.‖ Tex. R. Evid. 601(b).\n\n\n                                         18\n\f252, 259 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1281\n\n(2007).   When a trial court acts ―without regard for any guiding rules or\n\nprinciples,‖ it abuses its discretion. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Malone,\n\n972 S.W.2d 35, 43 (Tex. 1998). We may not conclude that a trial court abused\n\nits discretion merely because we would have ruled differently in the same\n\ncircumstances. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549,\n\n558 (Tex. 1995).\n\n      Lindley bears the burden of bringing forth a record that demonstrates the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion when it sustained appellees‘ objections to the\n\nsummary judgment evidence. See Cantu, 195 S.W.3d at 871. We must uphold\n\nthe trial court‘s evidentiary rulings if there is any legitimate basis in the record for\n\nthe rulings. Reynolds, 188 S.W.3d at 259.\n\n      A summary judgment affidavit must be based on personal knowledge,\n\nshow that the affiant is competent to testify, and contain facts that would be\n\nadmissible in evidence at trial. See Tex. R. App. P. 166a(f); United Blood Servs.\n\nv. Longoria, 938 S.W.2d 29, 30 (Tex. 1997); Souder v. Cannon, 235 S.W.3d 841,\n\n849 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2007, no pet.).           Conclusory statements are not\n\nproper summary judgment proof. See McIntyre v. Ramirez, 109 S.W.3d 741, 749\n\n(Tex. 2003); Ryland Group, Inc. v. Hood, 924 S.W.2d 120, 122 (Tex. 1996)\n\n(―Conclusory affidavits are not enough to raise fact issues. . . . They are not\n\ncredible, nor susceptible to being readily controverted.‖); Brownlee v. Brownlee,\n\n665 S.W.2d 111, 112 (Tex. 1984) (same). A conclusory statement is one that\n\n\n                                          19\n\fdoes not provide the underlying facts to support the conclusion. Souder, 235\n\nS.W.3d at 849; Residential Dynamics, LLC v. Loveless, 186 S.W.3d 192, 198\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2006, no pet.).\n\n      For example, in Seaway Products Pipeline Co. v. Hanley, an affidavit\n\nstated that a defendant ―indicated he was involved . . . in the development of . . .\n\nproperty.‖ 153 S.W.3d 643, 653 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, no pet.). We held\n\nthat the statement was conclusory because it did not ―set[] forth the facts to\n\nsupport what [the defendant] did to ‗indicate‘ that he was involved . . . in\n\ndeveloping the property.‖ Id. at 654; see also Cammack the Cook, L.L.C. v.\n\nEastburn, 296 S.W.3d 884, 895 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2009, pet. denied)\n\n(reasoning that an affidavit was conclusory because it alleged that a plaintiff‘s\n\nattorney‘s fee calculation was unreasonable but did not provide a factual basis to\n\nmake that claim); Haynes v. City of Beaumont, 35 S.W.3d 166, 178 (Tex. App.—\n\nTexarkana 2000, no pet.) (holding that affidavits were conclusory when they\n\nstated that an employee was terminated for ―poor and unacceptable behavior‖\n\nwithout disclosing examples of such behavior).\n\n      Appellees‘ objections to the conclusory nature of Lindley‘s affidavit related\n\n(in part) to the following statements:\n\n      I know that [Daws] had a close personal and confidential relationship\n      with [McKnight]. She often spoke of it. I know of several occasions\n      on which [Daws] sought the advice and counsel of [McKnight] in\n      connection with her financial affairs. . . . I also know that [McKnight]\n      would seek [Daws‘s] counsel in connection with the affairs of First\n      National Bank of Throckmorton because she was the largest single\n      shareholder in that bank. . . .\n\n\n                                         20\n\f             I know that [Daws] trusted [McKnight] to do the right thing for\n      her, the banks and their shareholders, since [Daws‘s] husband Jim\n      Bob Daws had been the Chairman of the Throckmorton bank for\n      many years prior to [McKnight‘s] ever becoming involved as an\n      employee or officer or shareholder of that bank.\n\nAssuming that these general statements are intended to stand independently\n\nfrom the remaining, more specific parts of Lindley‘s affidavit that discuss Daws‘s\n\nrelationship with McKnight, we conclude that the trial court could have\n\nreasonably determined that the statements do not contain sufficient factual detail\n\nto qualify as proper summary judgment proof.        Lindley failed to provide details\n\nabout what Daws said to lead Lindley to believe that a ―close personal and\n\nconfidential relationship‖ existed between Daws and McKnight, what matters\n\nDaws sought McKnight‘s counsel about, how Lindley knew that Daws had sought\n\nhis counsel, what matters McKnight sought Daws‘s counsel about, how Lindley\n\nknew that he had sought Daws‘s counsel, how Lindley knew that Daws trusted\n\nMcKnight to ―do the right thing for her,‖14 or why Daws‘s husband‘s role with the\n\nThrockmorton bank affected whether Daws trusted McKnight. Thus, we hold that\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining appellees‘ objections to at\n\nleast these statements, and we overrule Lindley‘s fourth issue to that extent.\n\nSee Reynolds, 188 S.W.3d at 259.\n\n\n\n\n      14\n         Subjective trust does not transform a business arrangement into a\nfiduciary relationship. Meyer, 167 S.W.3d at 331; Pabich v. Kellar, 71 S.W.3d\n500, 505 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2002, pet. denied) (op. on reh‘g).\n\n\n                                         21\n\f      We do not need to determine whether the trial court erred by sustaining\n\nappellees‘ objections to Lindley‘s remaining statements regarding Daws‘s\n\nrelationship with McKnight because we conclude that those statements, along\n\nwith the other evidence submitted by Lindley, do not raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact to establish a fiduciary duty owed by McKnight. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n47.1; Reynolds, 188 S.W.3d at 259. Specifically, we conclude that the following\n\nfacts do not amount to more than a scintilla of evidence to establish a confidential\n\nrelationship:\n\n      McKnight was Daws‘s distant relative (McKnight hesitantly said that he\n      believed that Daws‘s husband, who died several years before the events\n      relevant to this case, was his third or fourth cousin);\n\n      McKnight gratuitously advised Daws and other women in connection with\n      oil and gas matters that are unrelated to the corporations or the issues\n      involved in this case (his assistance was not special to Daws);15\n\n      McKnight once approached Daws to ask for an investment;16\n\n      McKnight lived close to Daws as a child and once worked for her husband;\n      and\n\n      McKnight was a pallbearer at Daws‘s funeral upon request by a funeral\n      director, and he attended her burial service.\n\n\n\n      15\n        The assistance for the oil and gas matters occurred in the 1990s. In a\ndeposition that Lindley submitted, McKnight said that he helped Daws to ―make\nsure that the oil companies . . . were fair.‖ He explained that he would ―help\nnearly anyone that asked for the help and never charge a fee.‖\n      16\n        Arms-length transactions entered for parties‘ mutual benefit do not\nestablish a basis for imposing a fiduciary relationship. Meyer, 167 S.W.3d at\n331.\n\n\n                                        22\n\fThese facts are common to ordinary friendly and neighborly relationships; they\n\ndo not demonstrate a special relationship of trust and confidence. We conclude,\n\ntherefore, that the facts do not amount to any material evidence that would justify\n\nthe imposition of an extraordinary fiduciary relationship. See Meyer, 167 S.W.3d\n\nat 330–31; Rice, 324 S.W.3d at 679; Cotten, 187 S.W.3d at 698. Thus, we hold\n\nthat the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment against Lindley‘s\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty claim, and we overrule that portion of her third issue.\n\nCommon law and statutory fraud\n\n      Next, Lindley contends that the trial court erred by granting summary\n\njudgment against her fraud and statutory fraud claims.            Lindley pled that\n\nappellees committed fraud and statutory fraud because McKnight knowingly\n\nmisrepresented the necessity and legal effect of the shareholders‘ agreements\n\nwith the intent to obtain Daws‘s signatures on them. A party commits fraud by\n\n(1) making a false, material misrepresentation (2) that the party either knows to\n\nbe false or asserts recklessly without knowledge of its truth (3) with the intent that\n\nthe misrepresentation be acted upon, (4) and the person to whom the\n\nmisrepresentation is made acts in reliance upon it (5) and is injured as a result.\n\nAll Am.

In response, Lindley first contended\n\nthat she did not have a burden to produce evidence of a misrepresentation\n\nbecause of McKnight‘s alleged fiduciary relationship with Daws (which we have\n\nconcluded that Lindley failed to raise a material fact issue on).18          She then\n\nproduced evidence that she claimed proved that (1) ―[t]here was a material\n\nmisrepresentation   made    by    [appellees]   to   [Daws]‖;   (2) ―[t]he    material\n\nrepresentation was false‖; (3) ―the knowledge of falsity and intent by [appellees]\n\nthat [Daws] act on the misrepresentations may be inferred from other evidence‖;\n\nand (4) ―Daws and her estate were injured by the misrepresentations.‖ Appellees\n\nreiterated in their reply to Lindley‘s response that Lindley had not produced\n\ncompetent evidence of reliance.\n\n\n\n      17\n        In a statutory fraud case, the plaintiff may receive exemplary damages if\nit proves the defendant‘s actual awareness of the falsity of a representation.\nTex.

Lindley argues that the alleged misrepresentation about the\n\nnecessity of the shareholders‘ agreements occurred when McKnight sent his\n\nNovember 1996 letter to Olney‘s shareholders. The letter stated in part,\n\n             In order to elect subchapter S treatment, all shareholders and\n      their spouses must agree in writing to the election, and for this\n      purpose we have enclosed . . . a Shareholders’ Agreement which\n      must be signed by all shareholders and their spouses.\n      The Shareholders‘ Agreement is designed to protect the election by\n      restricting transfer of stock to a shareholder who is not qualified to\n      be an S Corporation shareholder under the Internal Revenue Code.\n      The Board of Directors urges all shareholders and their spouses to\n      review carefully and execute the . . . Shareholders‘ Agreement. . . .\n\n             The Board of Directors strongly recommends the S\n      corporation election as being in the best interests of the Corporation\n      and its shareholders. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe italicized part of this letter might establish a genuine factual dispute about\n\nwhether McKnight misrepresented that the shareholders‘ agreements were\n\nrequired to achieve the corporations‘ conversions to Subchapter S entities\n\nbecause the corporations‘ attorney, Craig, said that the agreements were\n\nrecommended but not necessary. But Lindley did not provide evidence showing\n\nthat Daws relied on the letter‘s statement about the necessity of the\n\nshareholders‘ agreements when she signed either of the agreements. Lindley\n\ndid not show that the statement induced Daws to sign the agreements and that\n\nDaws would not have signed them if the letter would have instead stated, for\n\nexample, that the agreements were not required to elect Subchapter S status but\n\nthat, as explained by Craig, they were only recommended. Also, McKnight said\n\n\n                                       25\n\fin his deposition (which Lindley attached to her response) that he told Daws,\n\nwhose percentage of stock owned increased because of a reverse stock split\n\nassociated with the conversions, that the corporations would be allowed to\n\nrestrict stock ownership ―based on what was best‖ for the corporations.19\n\n      In her affidavit, Lindley stated,\n\n      I know that when [McKnight] told [Daws] that she needed to sign the\n      shareholders agreement with all of the terms that they contained in\n      order for the corporations to be able to elect Subchapter S\n      Corporation status that she relied on his word that all of the terms of\n      those agreements [were] necessary in order for Subchapter S\n      Corporation status to be elected.\n\n      Appellees objected to this statement on the grounds that it is conclusory\n\nand does not include predicate or foundation.          The trial court sustained\n\nappellees‘ objection. For reasons similar to those stated above, we hold that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining the objection and excluding\n\n      19\n        McKnight testified in his deposition that he discussed the Olney\nshareholders‘ agreement with Daws in person after she received the letter.\nDuring the conversation, McKnight told Daws that she could not transfer shares\nto a church, and McKnight also talked to Daws about another shareholder who\nwas upset about the reverse stock split. McKnight could not recall any other\nspecific subjects of the conversation. As appellees argue, there is no evidence\nthat McKnight even knew of Daws‘s desire to leave shares to Lindley at the time\nhe sent the letter to Daws or talked to her about the Olney shareholders‘\nagreement, so there is also no evidence that the purpose of the letter or\nconversation was to override the intentions she expressed in her will.\nFurthermore, contrary to Lindley‘s argument, the letter to Olney‘s shareholders\n(as quoted above) does not represent that the boards of directors would ―only\nrefuse to permit the shareholders to transfer their bank stock to persons . . . who\nwere not permitted by federal law to be subchapter S corporation shareholders.‖\n[Emphasis added.] The express terms of the shareholders‘ agreement, which\nwas enclosed with the letter, provided otherwise, and the letter told the\nshareholders to carefully review the agreement.\n\n\n                                          26\n\fthe statement. See Reynolds, 188 S.W.3d at 259. The trial court could have\n\nreasonably determined that the statement is conclusory because it does not\n\ndisclose underlying facts that support Lindley‘s supposed knowledge that Daws\n\nrelied on McKnight‘s statement in his letter.20 See McIntyre, 109 S.W.3d at 749;\n\nRyland Group, Inc., 924 S.W.2d at 122.\n\n      Without the statement expressly related to reliance from Lindley‘s affidavit,\n\nthe remaining evidence produced in response to appellees‘ no-evidence motion\n\ndoes not raise a genuine factual dispute about whether Daws relied on\n\nMcKnight‘s statements when she signed the shareholders‘ agreements, even if\n\nthose statements were false. Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err by\n\ngranting appellees‘ no-evidence motion on Lindley‘s fraud and statutory fraud\n\nclaims, and we overrule that part of Lindley‘s third issue. See Tex. R. Civ. P.\n\n166a(i); Hamilton, 249 S.W.3d at 426; see also Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann.\n\n§ 27.01(a)(1)(B); Grant Thornton LLP v. Prospect High Income Fund, 314\n\nS.W.3d 913, 923 (Tex. 2010) (reiterating that fraud requires ―that the plaintiff\n\nshow actual and justifiable reliance‖).\n\n           Appellees’ Affirmative Defense of Acceptance of Benefits\n\n      Because we have held that the trial court did not err by granting appellees‘\n\nno-evidence motion for summary judgment with respect to Lindley‘s breach of\n\nfiduciary duty, fraud, and statutory fraud claims, we now consider whether the\n\n      20\n        We therefore overrule the part of Lindley‘s fourth issue that challenges\nthe exclusion of this statement from Lindley‘s affidavit.\n\n\n                                          27\n\ftrial court correctly concluded that an affirmative defense raised as part of\n\nappellees‘ traditional motion for summary judgment precludes Lindley‘s breach of\n\ncontract and UDJA claims. As part of her second issue, Lindley contends that\n\nthe trial court erred by granting summary judgment to appellees on the basis of\n\ntheir acceptance of benefits defense.\n\n      In appellees‘ September 2006 supplemental answer to Lindley‘s second\n\namended original petition, they pled that Lindley‘s claims were barred by the\n\nacceptance of benefits defense. Appellees raised only accord and satisfaction\n\nand judicial estoppel in their January 2006 ―First Traditional Motion for Partial\n\nSummary Judgment.‖ However, appellees sought summary judgment on their\n\nacceptance of benefits defense in an October 2006 supplement to their\n\ntraditional motion for summary judgment. In January 2008, with leave of court,\n\nappellees again argued, in another supplement, that Lindley was estopped from\n\nbringing her claims because of acceptance of benefits. Lindley‘s response to\n\nappellees‘ January 2008 supplement recognized that appellees had raised an\n\nestoppel defense based on acceptance of benefits. In March 2009, appellees\n\nfiled a motion that asked the trial court to rule on the estoppel defense. The trial\n\ncourt signed a final judgment in April 2009 that granted summary judgment for\n\nappellees based on their traditional motion for summary judgment and ―additional\n\nmaterials submitted and before the court.‖ Lindley‘s briefing presents substantive\n\narguments related to appellees‘ acceptance of benefits defense; Lindley does not\n\nexpressly argue that the defense was not properly before the trial court or is not\n\n\n                                        28\n\fsubject to our consideration.   We will therefore consider the acceptance of\n\nbenefits defense. See Nguyen v. Woodley, 273 S.W.3d 891, 899 & n.6 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.) (holding that a trial court correctly\n\ngranted summary judgment on a ground contained in a supplement that was filed\n\nwith leave of court); Mowbray v. Avery, 76 S.W.3d 663, 687–88 (Tex. App.—\n\nCorpus Christi 2002, pet. denied) (overruling an appellant‘s issue concerning the\n\ntrial court‘s consideration of a supplemental motion for summary judgment).\n\n      As Lindley has recognized, ―acceptance of benefits‖ is a species of quasi-\n\nestoppel. Lopez v. Muñoz, Hockema & Reed, L.L.P., 22 S.W.3d 857, 864 (Tex.\n\n2000); Duncan Land & Exploration, Inc. v. Littlepage, 984 S.W.2d 318, 330 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 1998, pet. denied). Quasi-estoppel is an affirmative defense\n\nthat precludes a party from asserting, to another‘s disadvantage, a right\n\ninconsistent with a position previously taken. Clark v. Cotten Schmidt, L.L.P.,\n\n327 S.W.3d 765, 770 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2010, no pet.).          The defense\n\napplies when it would be unconscionable to allow a person to maintain a position\n\ninconsistent with one to which he acquiesced or from which he accepted a\n\nbenefit. Id.; Lopez, 22 S.W.3d at 864. Thus, quasi-estoppel forbids a party from\n\naccepting the benefits of a transaction and then subsequently taking an\n\ninconsistent position to avoid corresponding obligations or effects. Clark, 327\n\nS.W.3d at 770.\n\n      For example, in Doe v. Tex. Ass’n of Sch. Bds., Inc., we held that quasi-\n\nestoppel precluded a mother who obtained money under a settlement agreement\n\n\n                                       29\n\ffrom contending that she did not have the authority to provide the consideration\n\nrequired to secure the money. 283 S.W.3d 451, 464 (Tex.

Ryder,\n\nStilwell Inc., the Houston (First District) Court of Appeals held that quasi-estoppel\n\nprevented a property inspection company from claiming that a plaintiff did not\n\nhave standing to sue for a breach of the inspection contract when the company\n\naccepted the benefits of the contract and stated in a report that noncontracting\n\nentities could rely on the inspection report. 176 S.W.3d 80, 81–83, 87–88 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, no pet.); see also Mulvey v. Mobil Producing\n\nTex. & N.M. Inc., 147 S.W.3d 594, 608 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2004, pet.\n\ndenied) (holding that quasi-estoppel barred a party from challenging an\n\nagreement that it accepted benefits under); Twelve Oaks Tower I, Ltd. v. Premier\n\nAllergy, Inc., 938 S.W.2d 102, 111 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no\n\nwrit) (same).\n\n      Lindley‘s UDJA and breach of contract claims challenge either the validity\n\nof the shareholders‘ agreements or the actions that the corporations took under\n\nthe agreements.    But Daws‘s estate accepted benefits that it could not have\n\nreceived if the agreements are not valid and were not complied with. On October\n\n11, 2000, the corporations sent letters to Lindley to explain that under provisions\n\nof the shareholders‘ agreements that were detailed in the letters, they had\n\nrejected Daws‘s stock transfer to her and had redeemed Daws‘s shares.\n\n\n                                         30\n\fThe corporations informed Lindley that they were paying her $358.03 per share\n\nfor Daws‘s 625 shares of Olney stock and $5,543.89 per share for Daws‘s ninety-\n\ntwo shares of Throckmorton stock that the corporations redeemed.       Both letters\n\nstated, ―At the request of the Estate‘s counsel, . . . we have delayed in remitting\n\nto the Estate proceeds of the [stock] sale. However, we do not believe we should\n\ncontinue to delay in making payment.‖ The record contains copies of checks (of\n\n$510,037.88 for the Throckmorton shares and $223,768.75 for the Olney shares)\n\nsent by the corporations to Daws‘s estate and negotiated by Lindley.\n\n      During oral argument, Lindley‘s counsel conceded, ―The banks perfectly\n\ncomplied with their obligations under the shareholders‘ agreements when they\n\ntendered these checks.‖ It is undisputed that Lindley knew (by way of the letters)\n\nthat the corporations had disapproved of the transfers to her when she\n\nnegotiated the checks and that the checks were being issued for the redemption\n\nof the shares. The only reason that Daws‘s estate could have been entitled to\n\nreceive specific payments totaling $733,806.63 is the redemption of the stock\n\nunder section five of the shareholders‘ agreements. When Lindley negotiated the\n\nchecks, she obviously knew of her claims that Key had read Daws‘s will and that\n\nthe corporations had therefore allegedly received notice of Daws‘s intended\n\ntransfer to her because Key allegedly read Daws‘s will months before the checks\n\nwere negotiated. Throughout the course of this litigation, which began in 2000,\n\nLindley never returned the money that the corporations tendered to Daws‘s\n\nestate. We conclude that it would be unconscionable to allow Daws‘s estate to\n\n\n                                        31\n\fretain the benefit it received for the redemption of Daws‘s shares while it\n\nconcurrently challenges the provisions of the shareholders‘ agreements that\n\nmade the redemption possible.21 See Clark, 327 S.W.3d at 770.\n\n      Citing Lopez, Lindley argues that the ―Estate‘s initial acceptance of lesser\n\npayments in October 2000 . . . is not inconsistent with the Estate‘s subsequent\n\nassertion that it was entitled to more.‖ See 22 S.W.3d at 864. In Lopez, a\n\ncontingent fee contract allowed a law firm to collect 45% of the recovery if the\n\ncase was appealed to a higher court rather than 40% if it was not. Id. at 859.\n\nThe law firm charged the Lopezes the additional 5% when the defendant initiated\n\nthe appeal even though the case was settled shortly afterward. Id. Three years\n\nafter the Lopezes received a distribution for 55% of the settlement, it sued the\n\nfirm, and the firm asserted that ―acceptance of benefits‖ precluded the Lopezes‘\n\nfraud, negligence, and deceptive trade practices claims. Id. at 860, 863. In that\n\ncontext, the supreme court held that ―the Lopezes‘ initial acceptance of a lesser\n\nportion of the settlement is not inconsistent with their later assertion that they\n\nwere entitled to more.‖ Id. at 864. Thus, the supreme court concluded that by\n\naccepting 55% of the settlement, which the Lopezes were undisputedly entitled\n\n\n      21\n         Daws‘s estate, through Lindley, also acquiesced to the redemption of the\nshares through the shareholders‘ agreements in another way. After the estate\nreceived a notice of an estate tax deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service\n(IRS) in September 2004, the estate alleged that the IRS had overvalued Daws‘s\ninterest in the corporations‘ shares and asserted that the correct fair market value\nmatched the book value that the estate had received from the corporations in\nOctober 2000.\n\n\n                                        32\n\fto under any scenario, they were not precluded from contending that they were\n\nentitled to 5% more under the same provision of the contingent fee contract.\n\nSee id.\n\n      Here, however, Daws‘s estate could not be entitled to any money under\n\nsection five of the shareholders‘ agreement unless her shares were properly\n\nredeemed. And the shares could not have been properly redeemed if there is\n\nmerit to either of Lindley‘s breach of contract or UDJA claims, which asked the\n\ntrial court to either invalidate the transfer restrictions in the shareholders‘\n\nagreements or find that the corporations violated them. Thus, unlike in Lopez,\n\nLindley‘s claim to be entitled to more money in this case is not based on the\n\nsame part of the contract to which Daws‘s estate already received money; the\n\nclaim is instead premised on challenging the very mechanism from which the\n\n$733,806.63 was paid.\n\n      We recognize that there can be no estoppel from acceptance of benefits\n\nby a person who did not have knowledge of all material facts. Frazier v. Wynn,\n\n472 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1971); Clark, 327 S.W.3d at 770. Lindley contends\n\nthat she did not learn about the ―misrepresentations regarding the consent\n\ntransfer restrictions until the bank boards of directors refused to consent to the\n\ntransfer of [Daws‘s] stock.‖ But Daws‘s estate was the real plaintiff in the trial\n\ncourt, not Lindley.22 The summary judgment evidence shows that Daws knew of\n\n      22\n       As noted above, Lindley filed the lawsuit as Daws‘s estate‘s independent\nexecutor.\n\n\n                                       33\n\fthe transfer restrictions before her death. During McKnight‘s deposition, he said\n\nthat before the corporations received Subchapter S status, he talked to Daws for\n\nabout half an hour about the possible conversions, told her that there would be\n\nlimitations on who could own stock once the conversions occurred, and informed\n\nher that the boards of directors would have the authority to disapprove ―any\n\ntransfer of stock.‖ Furthermore, according to McKnight‘s affidavit, the restrictions\n\nimposed by the shareholders‘ agreements were ―conspicuously noted on all of\n\nthe share certificates of Olney and Throckmorton, including those issued to Nan\n\nDaws.‖ Finally, and most obviously, Daws signed the shareholders‘ agreements\n\nthat contained the restrictions. We must generally charge a party with knowledge\n\nof the contents of a document that the party signed. See EZ Pawn Corp. v.\n\nMancias, 934 S.W.2d 87, 90 (Tex. 1996).\n\n      More importantly, even if there was some point in the past when Daws did\n\nnot know of the transfer restrictions and the corporations‘ potential to refuse her\n\nintended devise of shares to Lindley, Daws‘s estate, through Lindley, accepted\n\nthe benefit in question ($733,806.63) at a time that it knew all facts regarding the\n\ndistribution of that benefit and the actual rejection of the transfer, as is evidenced\n\nby the corporations‘ letters sent to Lindley in August and October 2000. Cf.\n\nFrazier, 472 S.W.2d at 753 (holding that quasi-estoppel did not apply because\n\nthe appellant, who had orally leased land annually, did not have knowledge of a\n\nthree-year lease that was executed by her children at the time that she accepted\n\n$1,225 in rent).\n\n\n                                         34\n\f      For all of these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err by granting\n\nappellees‘ traditional motion for summary judgment against Lindley‘s UDJA and\n\nbreach of contract claims because appellees established their acceptance of\n\nbenefits (quasi-estoppel) defense as a matter of law. See Mann Frankfort, 289\n\nS.W.3d at 848; Clark, 327 S.W.3d at 770. We overrule Lindley‘s second issue to\n\nthat extent.23\n\n                  The Trial Court’s Award of Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In her fifth issue, Lindley argues that the trial court erred by awarding\n\nattorney‘s fees to appellees. In the trial court, appellees filed an affidavit of D.\n\nD‘lyn Davison, who was appellees‘ attorney at the time of the trial court‘s\n\nsummary judgment decision. The affidavit recited Davison‘s specialization in civil\n\ntrial law and detailed the work performed by her and appellees‘ previous counsel\n\nin this litigation. Davison expressed her familiarity with customary fees awarded\n\nby attorneys practicing in Wichita County, stated that the services rendered by\n\nappellees‘ counsel were necessary to properly represent appellees, and averred\n\nthat appellees incurred reasonable attorney‘s fees of over $200,000.\n\n\n\n\n      23\n        Our analysis to this point resolves the trial court‘s decision to grant\nsummary judgment against all of Lindley‘s claims.          Lindley raises other\narguments in her first through fourth issues that are not necessary to the\ndisposition of the claims as set forth herein, so we will not address those\narguments, and we overrule the remainder of Lindley‘s first through fourth issues\nas moot. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1; Hawkins v. Walker, 233 S.W.3d 380, 395\nn.47 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2007, pet. denied).\n\n\n                                        35\n\f      Lindley responded by asserting, among other arguments, that appellees\n\nhad failed to segregate the fees that were incurred in connection with the UDJA\n\nclaim from fees incurred in defending other causes of action. The trial court\n\nfound that Lindley‘s claims were ―intertwined to the point of being inseparable‖\n\nand therefore awarded appellees the ―entire amount of attorney[‘]s fees‖ they had\n\nsought, which was $201,356.76.24\n\n      At the outset, because we have held that the trial court properly granted\n\nsummary judgment against Lindley‘s UDJA claim, we hold that the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by determining that appellees are generally entitled to\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney‘s fees based on that claim.25 See Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009; Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 20–21\n\n(Tex. 1998); Comm’rs Court of Titus County v.

(explaining that the ―equity and justice of the fee\n\naward are left to the trial court‘s discretion‖).\n\n      The majority of Lindley‘s complaint about the trial court‘s award of\n\nattorney‘s fees concerns the court‘s alleged failure to properly segregate the fees\n\nthat the court awarded as to claims that permit the fees from those that do not.\n\n      24\n        The trial court also conditionally awarded attorney‘s fees related to\nLindley‘s appeal of the trial court‘s summary judgment decision.\n      25\n        Apart from the specific contentions discussed below, Lindley does not\nraise challenges on appeal to the general sufficiency of the evidence to prove\nthat appellees‘ attorney‘s fees are reasonable and necessary.\n\n\n                                           36\n\fA party may recover attorney's fees only if provided for by statute or by contract.\n\nGulf States Utilis. Co. v. Low, 79 S.W.3d 561, 567 (Tex. 2002). ―Parties seeking\n\nattorney‘s fees under Texas law ‗have always been required to segregate fees\n\nbetween claims for which they are recoverable and claims for which they are\n\nnot.‘‖ AMX Enters., L.L.P. v.

As the supreme court\n\nexplained,\n\n      [I]f any attorney‘s fees relate solely to a claim for which such fees\n      are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from\n      unrecoverable fees. Intertwined facts do not make tort fees\n      recoverable; it is only when discrete legal services advance both a\n      recoverable and unrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined\n      that they need not be segregated. . . .\n\n             ....\n\n            . . . [W]hen . . . it cannot be denied that at least some of the\n      attorney‘s fees are attributable only to claims for which fees are not\n      recoverable, segregation of fees ought to be required and the jury\n      ought to decide the rest.\n\nChapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313–14; see Potter, 230 S.W.3d at 466 (―An exception to\n\nthe duty to segregate arises when the party‘s claims are so interrelated that their\n\nprosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts.‖).\n\nThus, a trial court is not required to segregate its attorney‘s fee award when\n\ncounsel‘s work performs ―double service‖ to recoverable and unrecoverable\n\nclaims. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313.\n\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f      Lindley asserts that appellees would not normally be entitled to an\n\nattorney‘s fee award for defending any of the claims she brought other than her\n\nUDJA claim.      Appellees do not dispute the general correctness of this\n\nassertion.26 Rather, they contend, in part, that Lindley‘s pleading conflated her\n\ncauses of action to the extent that work performed by appellees‘ attorneys to\n\ndefeat Lindley‘s breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud claims\n\nconcomitantly defeated her UDJA claims. We agree.\n\n      Lindley‘s second amended petition, which was her live pleading during the\n\nsummary judgment proceedings, based Lindley‘s fraud, statutory fraud, and\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty claims on three alleged ―Misrepresentations‖:\n\n(1) McKnight‘s telling Daws that she needed to sign the shareholders‘\n\nagreements for the corporations‘ conversions to Subchapter S status;\n\n(2) McKnight‘s failure to disclose that the corporations could have made the\n\nconversions without the execution of the shareholders‘ agreements; and\n\n(3) McKnight‘s failure to disclose that the terms of the shareholders‘ agreements\n\ncould prevent Daws from performing her estate plan to transfer shares to Lindley.\n\nThe petition based Lindley‘s breach of contract action on appellees‘ alleged\n\nfailure to timely notify her of the rejection of the transfer of Daws‘s stock under\n\n      26\n       We note that an award of attorney‘s fees is generally inappropriate for\ndefending claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary, and fraud.

With regard to Lindley‘s UDJA claim, the petition\n\nstated,\n\n             In the further alternative, [Lindley] is a person interested under\n      the shareholders[‘] agreements and whose rights . . . are affected by\n      same, and is therefore entitled to obtain a declaration from this Court\n      of such rights . . . pursuant to . . . the Texas Civil Practice &\n      Remedies Code. . . . Plaintiff requests the Court to declare that the\n      shareholders[‘] agreements, or various provisions thereof, are void\n      because they were procured by fraud . . . , or because they contain\n      provisions which are unreasonable restraints on alienation of\n      [Daws‘s] stock which are invalid under Texas law. Plaintiff further\n      requests the Court to declare that the Defendants, in any event,\n      failed to comply with the shareholders[‘] agreements in seeking to\n      exercise their purported rights to redeem [Daws‘s] common stock for\n      only the book value price.\n\n      Thus, Lindley‘s petition shows that she predicated her UDJA claim on the\n\nfactual and legal theories that she offered in support of each of her other\n\nclaims.27   In a similar case in which a hospital‘s defense of a UDJA claim\n\ndepended on the same legal theory of its suit to recover on a lien, we held that\n\nthe ―resulting legal fees were so intertwined that they need not be segregated.‖\n\nSpeegle v. Harris Methodist Health Sys., 303 S.W.3d 32, 40 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2009, pet. denied) (op. on reh‘g). Because appellees‘ attorneys‘ legal\n\nservices that responded to each of Lindley‘s claims also necessarily served to\n\ndefend Lindley‘s theory of recovery on her UDJA claim, for which an award of\n\nattorney‘s fees is authorized by statute, we conclude that the trial court was not\n\n\n      27\n        Also, appellees‘ acceptance of benefits defense, which we have held\nprecludes Lindley‘s UDJA and breach of contract claims, provided ―double\nservice.‖ See Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313.\n\n\n                                         39\n\frequired to segregate its award of attorney‘s fees. See Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at\n\n313–14; Cooper v. Cochran, 288 S.W.3d 522, 537 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no\n\npet.) (―When the legal services provided advance both a claim for which\n\nattorney‘s fees are recoverable and a claim for which they are not recoverable,\n\nthe claims are so intertwined that they need not be segregated.‖); cf. A & L Eng’g\n\n& Consulting, Inc. v. Shiloh Apollo Plaza, Inc., 315 S.W.3d 928, 931 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2010, no pet.) (holding that a trial court was required to segregate its\n\naward of attorney‘s fees related to a UDJA claim from fees related to defending a\n\ncounterclaim because defending the counterclaim ―did nothing to advance‖ the\n\nUDJA action).\n\n      Lindley also argues that appellees are not entitled to attorney‘s fees for\n\nservices related to their unsuccessful motions to transfer venue.           Through\n\nmotions filed in 2001, appellees asked the trial court to transfer venue to\n\nThrockmorton County. The trial court overruled the motions in 2003. Lindley\n\nargues that a ―substantial portion‖ of the trial court‘s attorney‘s fee award relates\n\nto these motions and that there is no basis to allow fees in connection with\n\nprosecuting motions to transfer venue.28 But the motions to transfer venue, if\n\ngranted, certainly would have affected appellees‘ defense of Lindley‘s UDJA\n\nclaim along with the remainder of her suit.\n\n\n      28\n       In a document attached to Davison‘s affidavit, she asserted that only\n$3,749.69 of appellees‘ total fee was incurred because of services related to the\nmotions to transfer venue.\n\n\n                                         40\n\f      Moreover, Lindley does not cite authority that establishes that a trial court\n\nmust segregate specific services rendered by an attorney that were successful\n\nfor the attorney‘s client from services that were unsuccessful when awarding\n\nattorney‘s fees to a party that prevailed in the overall litigation of a UDJA claim.\n\nSuch a rule would be incongruous with authority stating that in a UDJA action,\n\n―the trial court may award attorney‘s fees to the prevailing party, may decline to\n\naward attorney‘s fees to either party, or may award attorney’s fees to the\n\nnonprevailing party, regardless of which party sought declaratory judgment.‖\n\nBrookshire Katy Drainage Dist. v. Lily Gardens, LLC, 333 S.W.3d 301, 313 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. filed) (emphasis added); see Indus.\n\nCommc’ns, Inc. v. Ward County Appraisal Dist., 296 S.W.3d 707, 723 (Tex.\n\nApp.—El Paso 2009, pet. denied) (―The granting or denial of attorney‘s fees in a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action . . . is not dependent on a finding that a party\n\nsubstantially prevailed.‖).29\n\n      Here, appellees are the prevailing parties on Lindley‘s UDJA claim.\n\nLindley contends that it is inequitable to require her to pay attorney‘s fees related\n\nto appellees‘ motions to transfer venue that she defeated. But the trial court\n\ncould have reasonably determined that Lindley would not have been required to\n\ndefend those motions apart from bringing her lawsuit, which the trial court\n\n      29\n        We note that federal courts, while attempting to apply Texas law, have\nstated that a party may recover for time spent on unsuccessful motions as long\nas it succeeds in the overall claim. See, e.g., DP Solutions, Inc. v. Rollins, Inc.,\n353 F.3d 421, 434 (5th Cir. 2003).\n\n\n                                         41\n\fultimately found to be unmeritorious.     We conclude that the trial court acted\n\nwithin its sound discretion by awarding attorney‘s fees to appellees for a service\n\nby their attorney that was incidental to their defense of Lindley‘s UDJA claim\n\neven if the service did not directly affect the ultimate resolution of the claim. 30\n\nSee Potter, 230 S.W.3d at 466; see also Templeton v. Dreiss, 961 S.W.2d 645,\n\n671 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied) (upholding an award of\n\nattorney‘s fees in a UDJA case that was based in part on time spent on\n\ndefending a motion for sanctions).\n\n      For all of these reasons, we overrule Lindley‘s fifth issue.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Having overruled all of Lindley‘s issues, we affirm the trial court‘s\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n                                                    TERRIE LIVINGSTON\n                                                    CHIEF JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: LIVINGSTON, C.J.; MCCOY and MEIER, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: July 7, 2011\n\n\n\n\n      30\n       We note that Lindley does not assert that appellees‘ motions to transfer\nvenue were frivolous or brought in bad faith.\n\n\n                                         42\n\f",

Ross\n\nMcKnight, Throckmorton Bancshares, Inc. (Throckmorton), Olney Bancshares of\n\nTexas, Inc. (Olney), and the remaining appellees listed above. Lindley contends\n\nthat the trial court erred by denying her motion for summary judgment, granting\n\nappellees‘ motions for summary judgment, making allegedly incorrect rulings on\n\nthe parties‘ objections to summary judgment evidence, and awarding more than\n\n$200,000 in attorney‘s fees to appellees. We affirm.\n\n                               Background Facts\n\n      Throckmorton and Olney are holding companies that purchase and own\n\naffiliated or unaffiliated banks.   McKnight is the chairman of the board and\n\npresident of Throckmorton, and he is the president of Olney. He owns stock in\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fboth corporations. Daws was one of the initial shareholders of Olney (investing\n\n$25,000), which was formed to acquire the First National Bank of Olney and later\n\nacquired seven other banks. She also owned significant stock in Throckmorton,\n\nwhich owns only the First National Bank of Throckmorton. Lindley is Daws‘s\n\nniece.\n\n         McKnight and Daws are distant relatives. Daws‘s husband, Jim Bob, was\n\nonce the chairman of the First National Bank of Throckmorton. McKnight has\n\nlived in the city of Throckmorton his entire life except when he attended college.\n\nHe was raised next door to the Dawses and lived close to them until he went to\n\ncollege. He considered them to be friends.\n\n         In 1996, Throckmorton and Olney considered conversions to S\n\ncorporations.1    In November of that year, McKnight sent a letter to Olney‘s\n\nshareholders stating that to complete the conversion, they needed to all agree to\n\nit through an IRS election form and a shareholders‘ agreement.\n\n         The Throckmorton shareholders‘ agreement, which was revised and\n\napproved by the corporation‘s attorney, Richard Dale Craig, contains the\n\nfollowing provisions, among others:\n\n\n         1\n       See generally 26 U.S.C.A. §§ 1361–1363 (West 2011); see also Thomas\nv.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ\ndenied) (explaining that Subchapter S status ―provides an alternate method to tax\nthe corporation‘s income‖). A disclosure memorandum sent by Olney to its\nshareholders in November 1996 explains that a Subchapter S election allows a\ncorporation‘s income to be passed through to shareholders‘ individual income tax\nreturns.\n\n\n                                        4\n\f                  SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT\n\n      THIS AGREEMENT made effective the 1st day of January,\n1997, by and among Throckmorton Bancshares, Inc., a Texas\ncorporation (the ―Corporation‖) and the undersigned shareholders of\nthe Corporation and their respective spouses (the ―Original\nShareholders‖).\n\n      ....\n\n      WHEREAS, the Corporation intends to file an election to be\ntaxed as an S corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended with the consent of the Original Shareholders; and\n\n      WHEREAS, the Original Shareholders, acting for themselves\nand for all persons who subsequently may become shareholders of\nthe Corporation (the ―Shareholders‖), and the Corporation wish to\nkeep the election in force until it is revoked pursuant to this\nAgreement.\n\n     NOW, THEREFORE, the Original Shareholders and the\nCorporation agree as follows:\n\n        Section 1. Voluntary Transfer of Stock. No Shareholder shall\ntransfer stock of the Corporation by sale, gift, assignment, pledge, or\nother voluntary disposition or encumbrance unless he shall have\nprovided the Corporation, at least thirty (30) days prior to the\nproposed transfer, with a written statement (the ―Notice‖) regarding\nthe identity of the proposed transferee sufficient to satisfy the\nCorporation that (a) the proposed transferee is an eligible S\ncorporation shareholder and (b) the proposed transfer will not cause\nthe record number of Shareholders of the Corporation to exceed\nthirty-two (32). Such proposed transfer may be effected by the\nShareholder only if the Corporation approves the transfer in\naccordance with Section 3 below. Any transfer of stock of the\nCorporation that is not described in this Section 1 as a voluntary\ntransfer shall be considered an involuntary transfer subject to the\nprovisions of Section 2 below.\n\n     Section 2. Involuntary Transfer of Stock.       In the event any\nShareholder:\n\n      (a) dies;\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\f            ....\n\n      and, as a result of such event, the stock of the Corporation owned\n      by that Shareholder is subject to being transferred, . . . the\n      Shareholder shall be deemed, when the identity of the proposed\n      transferee is established, to have given Notice, as defined under\n      Section 1 hereof, except that the Corporation shall not be deemed to\n      have received such Notice until the Corporation has actual\n      knowledge of the event and the identity of the proposed transferee.\n\n              Section 3. Approval by the Corporation. Within twenty (20)\n      days of the receipt of a Notice required by Section 1 hereof, the\n      Corporation shall advise the Shareholder who provided the Notice\n      whether the Corporation approves the transfer. The Corporation\n      may, in its sole discretion, approve or disapprove any proposed\n      transfer, except that the Corporation shall withhold its approval of\n      any proposed transfer if (a) it would cause or reasonably could\n      cause the Corporation‘s S status to terminate or (b) it would cause\n      the record number of Shareholders of the Corporation to exceed\n      thirty-two (32).[2]\n\n             Section 4. Effect of Noncompliance. In the event of any\n      purported or attempted transfer of stock that does not comply with\n      the provisions of this agreement, the purported transfer shall be void\n      and the purported transferee shall not be deemed to be a\n      Shareholder of the Corporation and shall not be entitled to receive a\n      new stock certificate or any dividends or other distributions on or\n      with respect to the stock.\n\n             Section 5. Redemption of Shares. If a Shareholder attempts\n      to transfer stock of the Corporation in a manner that does not comply\n      with the provisions of this Agreement, the shares purported to be\n      transferred shall, at the Corporation‘s option, be deemed to be\n      redeemed immediately before the occurrence of the attempted\n      transfer. If the Corporation exercises its option to redeem shares,\n      the amount to be paid therefor shall be their book value . . . as of the\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       The number of shareholders was limited to thirty-two because a state law\nprovision would have included executive officers‘ salaries in the calculation of\nfranchise tax if there were more than thirty-five shareholders.\n\n\n                                         6\n\f      end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the redemption . . . ,\n      which amount shall be payable in cash.[3]\n\n      Daws signed both corporations‘ shareholders‘ agreements.            McKnight\n\nasserted through an affidavit that the goals of the transfer restrictions were to\n\nprotect the corporations‘ anticipated Subchapter S status, minimize franchise\n\ntaxes, promote ownership by shareholders who contributed to the success of the\n\nbanks owned by the corporations ―in some way other than indirect ownership,‖\n\nand comply with various ―federal and state banking requirements, which may\n\nfrom time to time affect bank ownership.‖4\n\n      All of the corporations‘ shareholders had to consent to Subchapter S status\n\nfor the conversions to occur.5 Craig explained that new legislation had been\n\npassed that permitted financial institutions to become S corporations effective in\n\n1997. He also said that a corporation could not qualify for Subchapter S status if\n\n\n\n      3\n        The Olney shareholders‘ agreement contains provisions that are\nsubstantially similar to those in the Throckmorton agreement. The reference in\nsection three of the Throckmorton agreement to the mandated disapproval of a\ntransfer if ―it would cause the record number of Shareholders of the Corporation\nto exceed thirty-two‖ is changed in the Olney agreement to state that disapproval\nmust occur if ―it would be a violation of Section 7.05(b) of the Corporation‘s\nBylaws.‖ That section, as effective on December 1, 1996, states that except on\nthe written consent of the Olney board, the corporation‘s number of shareholders\ncould not exceed fifty.\n      4\n       As Lindley argued in the trial court, the corporations‘ bylaws do not dictate\nthat the corporations‘ shareholders be customers of the corporations‘ banks or\notherwise contribute to them. Nor do the bylaws require shareholders to be\nresidents of the counties in which the corporations or banks are located.\n      5\n       See 26 U.S.C.A. § 1362(a)(2).\n\n\n                                         7\n\fit had more than seventy-five shareholders.6 Craig conceded that federal law\n\ndoes       not   require   S   corporations   to   have   shareholders‘   agreements.\n\nHe explained, however, that such agreements are helpful to protect Subchapter\n\nS status because the agreements may prevent shareholders from exceeding\n\nseventy-five or from transferring stock to an impermissible shareholder, such as\n\nanother corporation. Craig said,\n\n             It‘s extremely easy to have an inadvertent termination of an\n       S election. And one of the reasons that you have a shareholders[‘]\n       agreement is to help put you in the best position to argue with the\n       IRS that there wasn‘t an impermissible transfer, that there are\n       contractual restrictions that prevent that. . . .\n\n              . . . [I]t‘s never a position that one wants to be in to ask for\n       forgiveness from the IRS.\n\n       Daws died on June 25, 2000 (years after signing the shareholders‘\n\nagreements), at which time she owned over 25% of the shares of Throckmorton‘s\n\nstock, making her the corporation‘s largest shareholder. She was a minority\n\nshareholder in Olney. She also had a checking account with the First National\n\nBank of Throckmorton that contained approximately $100,000.               Daws‘s will\n\nnamed Lindley as independent executor and bequeathed all of the residuary\n\nestate (including almost all of the stock) to her.\n\n       In August 2000, Lindley was officially appointed as the independent\n\nexecutor of Daws‘s estate, and a Wichita County court admitted Daws‘s will to\n\n\n       6\n      Today, an S corporation may have up to 100 shareholders.                See id.\n§ 1361(b)(1)(A).\n\n\n                                              8\n\fprobate.   During meetings occurring that same month, McKnight advised the\n\ncorporations‘ boards of directors that the corporations had received a copy of\n\nDaws‘s will on July 26, 2000. The minutes of the Throckmorton meeting state\n\nthat McKnight noted that ―under the terms of the Shareholders[‘] Agreement, Mrs.\n\nDaws‘[s] death constituted an ‗involuntary transfer‘ of her stock in the\n\nCorporation,‖ and the company had the ―sole discretion to approve or\n\ndisapprove‖ the attempted transfer. The minutes then explain that the directors\n\nrecognized\n\n      the benefit to the Corporation and its subsidiary bank of having local\n      ownership and the support which the local shareholders gave to the\n      bank. It was further noted that while the number of the Corporation‘s\n      shareholders was less than the maximum permitted under the\n      Corporation‘s Bylaws, it was still desirable not to increase the\n      number of shareholders.\n\n            . . . It was . . . recommended that the Board of Directors\n      disapprove the transfer to [Lindley], and that the stock be redeemed\n      in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders[‘] Agreement.\n\n      Thus, the Throckmorton board disapproved the transfer of ninety-two\n\nshares of stock to Lindley and voted that those shares be redeemed through a\n\npayment of the book value of the stock as of December 31, 1999.7 The Olney\n\nboard took a similar action as reflected in minutes from its August 2000 meeting;\n\nthe minutes state that corporation redeemed 625 shares of Olney stock that\n\nDaws attempted to transfer to Lindley.\n\n\n      7\n      Lindley still has the original certificate for Daws‘s Throckmorton shares.\nShe says that she ―refused to return it after being notified in October 2000‖ that\nThrockmorton had redeemed the shares.\n\n                                         9\n\f         On August 11, 2000, Bruce Crum, an attorney for the corporations, sent a\n\nletter to Lindley informing her of the disapproved transfer and redemption of the\n\nshares. Crum expressed that he included copies of audited financial statements\n\nfor the corporations and that he also sent the letter to Daws‘s estate‘s counsel.\n\nTen days later, Crum sent a letter to the estate‘s counsel that enclosed the\n\ncorporations‘ bylaws and the minutes of the meetings that had occurred that\n\nmonth.\n\n         Lindley sued McKnight, Throckmorton, Olney, and Throckmorton‘s and\n\nOlney‘s shareholders.8            Lindley asserted that appellees had implemented\n\nunenforceable shareholders‘ agreements. She sought declarations, under the\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA),9 that the agreements were\n\nunreasonable and void and that appellees had failed to comply with them. She\n\nalso alleged that McKnight had breached a fiduciary duty to Daws by failing to\n\ndisclose the legal effect of the agreements upon her estate, that appellees were\n\nliable       for   common   law    fraud   and    statutory fraud   based   on   alleged\n\nmisrepresentations about the necessity and legal effect of the agreements, and\n\n\n         8\n        Lindley referred to McKnight, Throckmorton, and Olney as ―Defendants‖;\nshe referred to the shareholders as ―Respondents.‖ She included some\nappellees in her original petition and added others to the suit at a later time; for\nsimplicity, we will refer to the parties that Lindley sued in December 2000 as\n―appellees,‖ and we will use the term ―appellees‖ to refer to actions taken by\nMcKnight, Throckmorton, and Olney even if the other appellees did not explicitly\njoin the actions.\n         9\n         See Tex.

Appellees also asked\n\nthe trial court to award attorney‘s fees.\n\n      Approximately five years after filing the suit, Lindley filed a motion for\n\npartial summary judgment on her claim that the agreements were void as a\n\n      10\n        Lindley said in an affidavit that Bryan Robertson Key, the secretary of\nThrockmorton and president of the First National Bank of Throckmorton, read\nDaws‘s will. Lindley asserts that the corporations received notice of her identity\nas the proposed transferee of Daws‘s stock when Key read the will and that the\ncorporations improperly rejected the transfer more than twenty days later.\n      11\n       In her pleading, Lindley did not specify the amount of damages that she\nrequested.\n      12\n        In his original answer, McKnight specifically denied that he visited Daws\nin a hospital ―or did anything to cause her to sign the Shareholders[‘]\nAgreements.‖ Lindley testified in a deposition that McKnight visited Daws in\n1996 to obtain Daws‘s signature on ―papers‖; McKnight testified that he visited\nher in December of that year to obtain a proxy so that her Throckmorton shares\ncould be voted, but he did not recall discussing specific terms of the\nshareholders‘ agreements with her at that time.\n\n\n                                            11\n\fmatter of law because they unreasonably restricted the transfer of stock.\n\nAppellees responded to Lindley‘s motion and filed a no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment on Lindley‘s claims. Appellees also filed a traditional motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment on their affirmative defenses. Lindley responded to\n\nboth of appellees‘ motions. With leave of court, appellees filed supplements to\n\ntheir traditional motion for summary judgment; the supplements contended,\n\namong other arguments, that Lindley was estopped from challenging the\n\nshareholders‘ agreements.\n\n      The trial court denied Lindley‘s motion for partial summary judgment and\n\ngranted appellees‘ motions for summary judgment. Lindley brought this appeal.\n\n                         Summary Judgment Standards\n\n      We review a summary judgment de novo. Travelers Ins. Co. v.

As we have explained,\n\n             While corporate officers owe fiduciary duties to the corporation\n      they serve, they do not generally owe fiduciary duties to individual\n      shareholders unless a contract or confidential relationship exists\n      between them in addition to the corporate relationship. Due to its\n      extraordinary nature, the law does not recognize a fiduciary\n      relationship lightly. Therefore, whether such a duty exists depends\n      on the circumstances.\n\n             Fiduciary duties may arise from formal and informal\n      relationships and may be created by contract. An informal fiduciary\n      duty may arise from a moral, social, domestic, or purely personal\n      relationship of trust and confidence, generally called a confidential\n      relationship. A confidential relationship exists where influence has\n      been acquired and abused and confidence has been extended and\n      betrayed. A person is justified in placing confidence in the belief that\n      another party will act in his best interest only where he is\n      accustomed to being guided by the judgment or advice of the other\n      party and there exists a long association in a business relationship\n      as well as personal friendship. Thus, the relationship must exist\n      prior to and apart from the agreement that is the basis of the suit.\n      And, although a confidential relationship is ordinarily a question of\n      fact for the jury, it becomes a question of law when the trial court\n      refuses to submit issues on fiduciary duty based on no evidence.\n\n\n                                        16\n\fCotten v.

See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n47.1; Reynolds, 188 S.W.3d at 259. Specifically, we conclude that the following\n\nfacts do not amount to more than a scintilla of evidence to establish a confidential\n\nrelationship:\n\n      McKnight was Daws‘s distant relative (McKnight hesitantly said that he\n      believed that Daws‘s husband, who died several years before the events\n      relevant to this case, was his third or fourth cousin);\n\n      McKnight gratuitously advised Daws and other women in connection with\n      oil and gas matters that are unrelated to the corporations or the issues\n      involved in this case (his assistance was not special to Daws);15\n\n      McKnight once approached Daws to ask for an investment;16\n\n      McKnight lived close to Daws as a child and once worked for her husband;\n      and\n\n      McKnight was a pallbearer at Daws‘s funeral upon request by a funeral\n      director, and he attended her burial service.\n\n\n\n      15\n        The assistance for the oil and gas matters occurred in the 1990s. In a\ndeposition that Lindley submitted, McKnight said that he helped Daws to ―make\nsure that the oil companies . . . were fair.‖ He explained that he would ―help\nnearly anyone that asked for the help and never charge a fee.‖\n      16\n        Arms-length transactions entered for parties‘ mutual benefit do not\nestablish a basis for imposing a fiduciary relationship.

We conclude,\n\ntherefore, that the facts do not amount to any material evidence that would justify\n\nthe imposition of an extraordinary fiduciary relationship.

Lindley pled that\n\nappellees committed fraud and statutory fraud because McKnight knowingly\n\nmisrepresented the necessity and legal effect of the shareholders‘ agreements\n\nwith the intent to obtain Daws‘s signatures on them.

Lindley argues that the alleged misrepresentation about the\n\nnecessity of the shareholders‘ agreements occurred when McKnight sent his\n\nNovember 1996 letter to Olney‘s shareholders. The letter stated in part,\n\n             In order to elect subchapter S treatment, all shareholders and\n      their spouses must agree in writing to the election, and for this\n      purpose we have enclosed . . . a Shareholders’ Agreement which\n      must be signed by all shareholders and their spouses.\n      The Shareholders‘ Agreement is designed to protect the election by\n      restricting transfer of stock to a shareholder who is not qualified to\n      be an S Corporation shareholder under the Internal Revenue Code.\n      The Board of Directors urges all shareholders and their spouses to\n      review carefully and execute the . . . Shareholders‘ Agreement. . . .\n\n             The Board of Directors strongly recommends the S\n      corporation election as being in the best interests of the Corporation\n      and its shareholders. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe italicized part of this letter might establish a genuine factual dispute about\n\nwhether McKnight misrepresented that the shareholders‘ agreements were\n\nrequired to achieve the corporations‘ conversions to Subchapter S entities\n\nbecause the corporations‘ attorney, Craig, said that the agreements were\n\nrecommended but not necessary. But Lindley did not provide evidence showing\n\nthat Daws relied on the letter‘s statement about the necessity of the\n\nshareholders‘ agreements when she signed either of the agreements. Lindley\n\ndid not show that the statement induced Daws to sign the agreements and that\n\nDaws would not have signed them if the letter would have instead stated, for\n\nexample, that the agreements were not required to elect Subchapter S status but\n\nthat, as explained by Craig, they were only recommended. Also, McKnight said\n\n\n                                       25\n\fin his deposition (which Lindley attached to her response) that he told Daws,\n\nwhose percentage of stock owned increased because of a reverse stock split\n\nassociated with the conversions, that the corporations would be allowed to\n\nrestrict stock ownership ―based on what was best‖ for the corporations.19\n\n      In her affidavit, Lindley stated,\n\n      I know that when [McKnight] told [Daws] that she needed to sign the\n      shareholders agreement with all of the terms that they contained in\n      order for the corporations to be able to elect Subchapter S\n      Corporation status that she relied on his word that all of the terms of\n      those agreements [were] necessary in order for Subchapter S\n      Corporation status to be elected.\n\n      Appellees objected to this statement on the grounds that it is conclusory\n\nand does not include predicate or foundation.          The trial court sustained\n\nappellees‘ objection. For reasons similar to those stated above, we hold that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining the objection and excluding\n\n      19\n        McKnight testified in his deposition that he discussed the Olney\nshareholders‘ agreement with Daws in person after she received the letter.\nDuring the conversation, McKnight told Daws that she could not transfer shares\nto a church, and McKnight also talked to Daws about another shareholder who\nwas upset about the reverse stock split. McKnight could not recall any other\nspecific subjects of the conversation. As appellees argue, there is no evidence\nthat McKnight even knew of Daws‘s desire to leave shares to Lindley at the time\nhe sent the letter to Daws or talked to her about the Olney shareholders‘\nagreement, so there is also no evidence that the purpose of the letter or\nconversation was to override the intentions she expressed in her will.\nFurthermore, contrary to Lindley‘s argument, the letter to Olney‘s shareholders\n(as quoted above) does not represent that the boards of directors would ―only\nrefuse to permit the shareholders to transfer their bank stock to persons . . . who\nwere not permitted by federal law to be subchapter S corporation shareholders.‖\n[Emphasis added.] The express terms of the shareholders‘ agreement, which\nwas enclosed with the letter, provided otherwise, and the letter told the\nshareholders to carefully review the agreement.\n\n\n                                          26\n\fthe statement. See Reynolds, 188 S.W.3d at 259. The trial court could have\n\nreasonably determined that the statement is conclusory because it does not\n\ndisclose underlying facts that support Lindley‘s supposed knowledge that Daws\n\nrelied on McKnight‘s statement in his letter.20 See McIntyre, 109 S.W.3d at 749;\n\nRyland Group, Inc., 924 S.W.2d at 122.\n\n      Without the statement expressly related to reliance from Lindley‘s affidavit,\n\nthe remaining evidence produced in response to appellees‘ no-evidence motion\n\ndoes not raise a genuine factual dispute about whether Daws relied on\n\nMcKnight‘s statements when she signed the shareholders‘ agreements, even if\n\nthose statements were false. Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err by\n\ngranting appellees‘ no-evidence motion on Lindley‘s fraud and statutory fraud\n\nclaims, and we overrule that part of Lindley‘s third issue.

In January 2008, with leave of court,\n\nappellees again argued, in another supplement, that Lindley was estopped from\n\nbringing her claims because of acceptance of benefits. Lindley‘s response to\n\nappellees‘ January 2008 supplement recognized that appellees had raised an\n\nestoppel defense based on acceptance of benefits. In March 2009, appellees\n\nfiled a motion that asked the trial court to rule on the estoppel defense. The trial\n\ncourt signed a final judgment in April 2009 that granted summary judgment for\n\nappellees based on their traditional motion for summary judgment and ―additional\n\nmaterials submitted and before the court.‖ Lindley‘s briefing presents substantive\n\narguments related to appellees‘ acceptance of benefits defense; Lindley does not\n\nexpressly argue that the defense was not properly before the trial court or is not\n\n\n                                        28\n\fsubject to our consideration.

But Daws‘s estate accepted benefits that it could not have\n\nreceived if the agreements are not valid and were not complied with. On October\n\n11, 2000, the corporations sent letters to Lindley to explain that under provisions\n\nof the shareholders‘ agreements that were detailed in the letters, they had\n\nrejected Daws‘s stock transfer to her and had redeemed Daws‘s shares.\n\n\n                                         30\n\fThe corporations informed Lindley that they were paying her $358.03 per share\n\nfor Daws‘s 625 shares of Olney stock and $5,543.89 per share for Daws‘s ninety-\n\ntwo shares of Throckmorton stock that the corporations redeemed.       Both letters\n\nstated, ―At the request of the Estate‘s counsel, . . . we have delayed in remitting\n\nto the Estate proceeds of the [stock] sale. However, we do not believe we should\n\ncontinue to delay in making payment.‖ The record contains copies of checks (of\n\n$510,037.88 for the Throckmorton shares and $223,768.75 for the Olney shares)\n\nsent by the corporations to Daws‘s estate and negotiated by Lindley.\n\n      During oral argument, Lindley‘s counsel conceded, ―The banks perfectly\n\ncomplied with their obligations under the shareholders‘ agreements when they\n\ntendered these checks.‖ It is undisputed that Lindley knew (by way of the letters)\n\nthat the corporations had disapproved of the transfers to her when she\n\nnegotiated the checks and that the checks were being issued for the redemption\n\nof the shares. The only reason that Daws‘s estate could have been entitled to\n\nreceive specific payments totaling $733,806.63 is the redemption of the stock\n\nunder section five of the shareholders‘ agreements. When Lindley negotiated the\n\nchecks, she obviously knew of her claims that Key had read Daws‘s will and that\n\nthe corporations had therefore allegedly received notice of Daws‘s intended\n\ntransfer to her because Key allegedly read Daws‘s will months before the checks\n\nwere negotiated. Throughout the course of this litigation, which began in 2000,\n\nLindley never returned the money that the corporations tendered to Daws‘s\n\nestate. We conclude that it would be unconscionable to allow Daws‘s estate to\n\n\n                                        31\n\fretain the benefit it received for the redemption of Daws‘s shares while it\n\nconcurrently challenges the provisions of the shareholders‘ agreements that\n\nmade the redemption possible.21 See Clark, 327 S.W.3d at 770.\n\n      Citing Lopez, Lindley argues that the ―Estate‘s initial acceptance of lesser\n\npayments in October 2000 . . . is not inconsistent with the Estate‘s subsequent\n\nassertion that it was entitled to more.‖ See 22 S.W.3d at 864. In Lopez, a\n\ncontingent fee contract allowed a law firm to collect 45% of the recovery if the\n\ncase was appealed to a higher court rather than 40% if it was not. Id. at 859.\n\nThe law firm charged the Lopezes the additional 5% when the defendant initiated\n\nthe appeal even though the case was settled shortly afterward. Id. Three years\n\nafter the Lopezes received a distribution for 55% of the settlement, it sued the\n\nfirm, and the firm asserted that ―acceptance of benefits‖ precluded the Lopezes‘\n\nfraud, negligence, and deceptive trade practices claims. Id. at 860, 863. In that\n\ncontext, the supreme court held that ―the Lopezes‘ initial acceptance of a lesser\n\nportion of the settlement is not inconsistent with their later assertion that they\n\nwere entitled to more.‖ Id. at 864. Thus, the supreme court concluded that by\n\naccepting 55% of the settlement, which the Lopezes were undisputedly entitled\n\n\n      21\n         Daws‘s estate, through Lindley, also acquiesced to the redemption of the\nshares through the shareholders‘ agreements in another way. After the estate\nreceived a notice of an estate tax deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service\n(IRS) in September 2004, the estate alleged that the IRS had overvalued Daws‘s\ninterest in the corporations‘ shares and asserted that the correct fair market value\nmatched the book value that the estate had received from the corporations in\nOctober 2000.\n\n\n                                        32\n\fto under any scenario, they were not precluded from contending that they were\n\nentitled to 5% more under the same provision of the contingent fee contract.\n\nSee id.\n\n      Here, however, Daws‘s estate could not be entitled to any money under\n\nsection five of the shareholders‘ agreement unless her shares were properly\n\nredeemed. And the shares could not have been properly redeemed if there is\n\nmerit to either of Lindley‘s breach of contract or UDJA claims, which asked the\n\ntrial court to either invalidate the transfer restrictions in the shareholders‘\n\nagreements or find that the corporations violated them. Thus, unlike in Lopez,\n\nLindley‘s claim to be entitled to more money in this case is not based on the\n\nsame part of the contract to which Daws‘s estate already received money; the\n\nclaim is instead premised on challenging the very mechanism from which the\n\n$733,806.63 was paid.\n\n      We recognize that there can be no estoppel from acceptance of benefits\n\nby a person who did not have knowledge of all material facts.

Lindley contends\n\nthat she did not learn about the ―misrepresentations regarding the consent\n\ntransfer restrictions until the bank boards of directors refused to consent to the\n\ntransfer of [Daws‘s] stock.‖ But Daws‘s estate was the real plaintiff in the trial\n\ncourt, not Lindley.22 The summary judgment evidence shows that Daws knew of\n\n      22\n       As noted above, Lindley filed the lawsuit as Daws‘s estate‘s independent\nexecutor.\n\n\n                                       33\n\fthe transfer restrictions before her death. During McKnight‘s deposition, he said\n\nthat before the corporations received Subchapter S status, he talked to Daws for\n\nabout half an hour about the possible conversions, told her that there would be\n\nlimitations on who could own stock once the conversions occurred, and informed\n\nher that the boards of directors would have the authority to disapprove ―any\n\ntransfer of stock.‖ Furthermore, according to McKnight‘s affidavit, the restrictions\n\nimposed by the shareholders‘ agreements were ―conspicuously noted on all of\n\nthe share certificates of Olney and Throckmorton, including those issued to Nan\n\nDaws.‖ Finally, and most obviously, Daws signed the shareholders‘ agreements\n\nthat contained the restrictions. We must generally charge a party with knowledge\n\nof the contents of a document that the party signed.

Cf.\n\nFrazier, 472 S.W.2d at 753 (holding that quasi-estoppel did not apply because\n\nthe appellant, who had orally leased land annually, did not have knowledge of a\n\nthree-year lease that was executed by her children at the time that she accepted\n\n$1,225 in rent).\n\n\n                                         34\n\f      For all of these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err by granting\n\nappellees‘ traditional motion for summary judgment against Lindley‘s UDJA and\n\nbreach of contract claims because appellees established their acceptance of\n\nbenefits (quasi-estoppel) defense as a matter of law. See Mann Frankfort, 289\n\nS.W.3d at 848; Clark, 327 S.W.3d at 770. We overrule Lindley‘s second issue to\n\nthat extent.23\n\n                  The Trial Court’s Award of Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In her fifth issue, Lindley argues that the trial court erred by awarding\n\nattorney‘s fees to appellees. In the trial court, appellees filed an affidavit of D.\n\nD‘lyn Davison, who was appellees‘ attorney at the time of the trial court‘s\n\nsummary judgment decision. The affidavit recited Davison‘s specialization in civil\n\ntrial law and detailed the work performed by her and appellees‘ previous counsel\n\nin this litigation. Davison expressed her familiarity with customary fees awarded\n\nby attorneys practicing in Wichita County, stated that the services rendered by\n\nappellees‘ counsel were necessary to properly represent appellees, and averred\n\nthat appellees incurred reasonable attorney‘s fees of over $200,000.\n\n\n\n\n      23\n        Our analysis to this point resolves the trial court‘s decision to grant\nsummary judgment against all of Lindley‘s claims.          Lindley raises other\narguments in her first through fourth issues that are not necessary to the\ndisposition of the claims as set forth herein, so we will not address those\narguments, and we overrule the remainder of Lindley‘s first through fourth issues\nas moot.

The trial court\n\nfound that Lindley‘s claims were ―intertwined to the point of being inseparable‖\n\nand therefore awarded appellees the ―entire amount of attorney[‘]s fees‖ they had\n\nsought, which was $201,356.76.24\n\n      At the outset, because we have held that the trial court properly granted\n\nsummary judgment against Lindley‘s UDJA claim, we hold that the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by determining that appellees are generally entitled to\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney‘s fees based on that claim.25 See Tex.

(holding that a trial court was required to segregate its\n\naward of attorney‘s fees related to a UDJA claim from fees related to defending a\n\ncounterclaim because defending the counterclaim ―did nothing to advance‖ the\n\nUDJA action).\n\n      Lindley also argues that appellees are not entitled to attorney‘s fees for\n\nservices related to their unsuccessful motions to transfer venue.           Through\n\nmotions filed in 2001, appellees asked the trial court to transfer venue to\n\nThrockmorton County. The trial court overruled the motions in 2003. Lindley\n\nargues that a ―substantial portion‖ of the trial court‘s attorney‘s fee award relates\n\nto these motions and that there is no basis to allow fees in connection with\n\nprosecuting motions to transfer venue.28 But the motions to transfer venue, if\n\ngranted, certainly would have affected appellees‘ defense of Lindley‘s UDJA\n\nclaim along with the remainder of her suit.\n\n\n      28\n       In a document attached to Davison‘s affidavit, she asserted that only\n$3,749.69 of appellees‘ total fee was incurred because of services related to the\nmotions to transfer venue.\n\n\n                                         40\n\f      Moreover, Lindley does not cite authority that establishes that a trial court\n\nmust segregate specific services rendered by an attorney that were successful\n\nfor the attorney‘s client from services that were unsuccessful when awarding\n\nattorney‘s fees to a party that prevailed in the overall litigation of a UDJA claim.\n\nSuch a rule would be incongruous with authority stating that in a UDJA action,\n\n―the trial court may award attorney‘s fees to the prevailing party, may decline to\n\naward attorney‘s fees to either party, or may award attorney’s fees to the\n\nnonprevailing party, regardless of which party sought declaratory judgment.‖\n\nBrookshire Katy Drainage Dist. v.
