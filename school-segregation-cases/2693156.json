Continental\r\nspecifically argues that (1) Fina was not an additional insured and (2) if Fina was an\r\nadditional insured, coverage was excluded for Fina’s claims.  Fina appeals the trial court’s\r\ndetermination that Continental did not waive its right to subrogation.  We reverse the\r\njudgment and render judgment that Fina take nothing.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>BACKGROUND</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>On August 12, 1997, A&amp;B wrote a letter to Fina proposing to perform steel erection\r\nfor three buildings.  The letter stated,</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>A&amp;B Builders, Inc. is pleased to offer our proposal to furnish labor,\r\ntools, material (not furnished by Fina), equipment, insurance and supervision\r\nto complete steel erection for the above referenced buildings. . . . </span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                      </span>. . . .</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>We appreciate the opportunity to quote this work to Fina Oil &amp;\r\nChemical and look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

The certificate contained the following\r\ndisclaimer: “This certificate is issued as a matter of information only and confers no rights\r\nupon the certificate holder.

The reverse side of the purchase orders contained terms and\r\nconditions of the sale.  These terms and conditions made no reference to the provision of\r\ninsurance by the seller to the buyer. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>On August 14, 1997, Larry Wisdom, an employee of A&amp;B, was injured when a load\r\nof steel beams, which was being unloaded on the Fina work site, fell.  Wisdom sued Fina and\r\ntwo other corporations who were involved in the work, alleging negligence.  Specifically,\r\nWisdom alleged that Fina was negligent in (1) failing to supervise properly, (2) issuing a\r\npermit to unload unbanded steel with a forklift, (3) failing to supply a cherry picker for\r\nunloading the unbanded steel, (4) rushing the unloading process, (5) failing to supply a safe\r\nworkplace, and (6) allowing an unsafe activity on its premises.  Wisdom did not sue A&amp;B,\r\nhis employer, through whom he was receiving worker’s compensation benefits.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>A&amp;B was insured by Continental under several policies, including worker’s\r\ncompensation insurance and commercial general liability insurance.  As the insurer,\r\nContinental paid medical expenses and wage benefits to Wisdom.  In August 1999, after\r\nlearning of Wisdom’s lawsuit, Continental filed a petition in intervention, asserting a lien in\r\nthe amount of $107,979.04 on the first monies paid to Wisdom, stating that Wisdom\r\ncontinued to receive medical treatment and wage benefits, and seeking judgment of at least\r\n$107,979.04.  Four days later, counsel for Fina sent a letter to A&amp;B, with a copy to\r\nContinental, demanding a defense and indemnity under the terms of the certificate of\r\ninsurance.  On September 16, 1999, Fina sent a letter by fax to Continental, with a copy to\r\nA&amp;B, reiterating Fina’s demand for a defense and indemnity.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Fina filed a counterclaim to Continental’s petition in intervention, alleging that Fina\r\nwas an additional insured under A&amp;B’s insurance policies and asserting that Continental had\r\nbreached its duties under the policies by refusing to defend and indemnify Fina and by\r\nseeking to enforce a lien against Fina for benefits paid to Wisdom.  Continental generally\r\ndenied Fina’s allegations.  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.  Continental\r\ncontended that Fina was not an additional insured under A&amp;B’s insurance policies and that\r\nContinental did not waive its subrogation rights.  Fina argued that it was an additional\r\ninsured and was entitled to a defense and indemnification and that Continental waived its\r\nsubrogation rights.  The trial court granted both motions in part, declaring that Fina was an\r\nadditional insured under the policy on the date of Wisdom’s accident and that Continental\r\ndid not waive its subrogation rights.  Meanwhile, Fina and the two other defendants in the\r\nunderlying lawsuit settled with Wisdom.  Fina paid $115,000, and the other defendants paid\r\na total of $122,500.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>After the trial court granted the partial summary judgments, the court granted\r\nContinental’s unopposed motion to sever the breach-of-contract issues from the rest of the\r\ncase.  The issue of attorney’s fees relating to the breach-of-contract issues was tried to the\r\ncourt.  The parties stipulated that Fina’s costs of defense, in the amount of $56,484.75,\r\nrelating to Wisdom’s cause of action were reasonable and necessary.  The trial court awarded\r\nFina $166,269.44 as attorney’s fees and expenses for the trial of the breach-of-contract claim,\r\n$115,000 for settlement of Wisdom’s claim, and $56,484.75 for costs of defense of\r\nWisdom’s claim.  The total award to Fina against Continental, including prejudgment\r\ninterest, was $365,751.61.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>DISCUSSION</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>I.<span>        </span>Standard of Review</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Insurance policies are controlled by rules of interpretation and construction applicable\r\nto contracts generally.  <i>Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Indus., Inc.</i>, 907 S.W.2d 517, 520\r\n(Tex. 1995).<i>  </i>The primary concern of a court in construing a written contract is to ascertain\r\nthe true intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument.  <i>Id.  </i>Terms in contracts are given\r\ntheir plain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning unless the contract itself shows that\r\nparticular definitions are used to replace that meaning.  <i>W. Reserve Life Ins. v. Meadows</i>, 261\r\nS.W.2d 554, 557 (Tex. 1953).  If a written contract is so worded that it can be given a\r\ndefinite or certain legal meaning, it is not ambiguous.  <i>Nat’l Union Fire</i>, 907 S.W.2d at 520. \r\nThe interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court.  <i>Perry v.\r\nHouston Indep. Sch. Dist.</i>, 902 S.W.2d 544, 547 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, writ\r\ndism’d w.o.j.).  If an insurance policy is ambiguous, however, it will be interpreted in favor\r\nof the insured.  <i>Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. v. McKee</i>, 943 S.W.2d 455, 458 (Tex. 1997). </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>II.<span>      </span>Continental’s Appeal</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><i><span>           </span>A.<span>       </span>Additional Insured</i></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>In its first issue, Continental contends that Fina was not an additional insured as\r\ndefined by the additional-insured endorsement because there was no written contract or\r\nagreement requiring A&amp;B to add Fina as an additional insured.  Fina responds that its written\r\nbid dated August 12, 1997, which proposed to “furnish . . . insurance,” became the written\r\ncontract when it was accepted by Fina.  Fina argues that a written bid that is orally accepted\r\nand acted upon constitutes an agreement in writing and that, when a contract has been\r\nreduced to writing, is signed by one of the parties, and is ratified and accepted by both\r\nparties, it is treated as a written instrument that is binding on both parties.  Fina cites <i>J.H.\r\nBeall v. Hardwicke-Etter Co.</i>, 460 S.W.2d 516 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1970, writ dism’d\r\nw.o.j.),  <i>Taylor Construction Co. v. Clynch</i>, 196 S.W.2d 700 (Tex. Civ. App.—Amarillo\r\n1946, no writ), and <i>Salisbury v. Taylor</i>, 5 S.W.2d 874 (Tex. Civ. App.—Austin 1928, no\r\nwrit) to support this argument.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>We do not disagree with Fina’s statement of the law; however, that principle does not\r\napply to the present case.  As between Fina and A&amp;B, the parties could form a written\r\ncontract, a parol contract, or a combination of the two.  The issue in this case is not merely\r\nwhether there was a contract between Fina and A&amp;B, but whether that contract complied\r\nwith the contract of insurance between A&amp;B and Continental. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>To be legally binding, a contract must be sufficiently definite in its terms so that a\r\ncourt can understand the parties’ obligations.  <i>T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v. Bank of El Paso</i>, 847\r\nS.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex. 1992).  The parties must agree upon the material terms of the contract\r\nfor it to be enforceable.  <i>Id.</i>  In the present case, a bid to “furnish . . . insurance,” with\r\nnothing more, cannot be said to embody the material terms of a contract to provide that\r\ninsurance.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>The additional-insured endorsement conditioned the amendment of A&amp;B’s policy\r\nregarding who was an insured on (1) a requirement under a written contract to add another\r\nperson or organization as an additional insured and (2) the issuance of a certificate of\r\ninsurance listing that person or organization as an additional insured.  It may be true, as\r\nargued by Fina, that both Fina and A&amp;B understood that Fina would become an additional\r\ninsured under A&amp;B’s policy and that A&amp;B requested the issuance of a certificate of\r\ninsurance on August 12.  However, neither A&amp;B’s proposal nor Fina’s purchase requisitions\r\nor purchase orders specifically require adding Fina as an additional insured,</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> and the\r\ncertificate of insurance was not issued until August 18, 1997.  Accordingly, we hold that Fina\r\nwas not an additional insured under A&amp;B’s policy on August 14, 1997, the date of Wisdom’s\r\ninjury.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>We sustain Continental’s first issue.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span><span><i>B.<span>       </span>Exclusions</i></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>In its second issue, Continental contends that, even if Fina was an additional insured\r\non August 14, 1997, coverage for Wisdom’s injury was excluded under the policy’s\r\nexclusionary language.  Continental argues that the first of two limitations paragraphs\r\nextended coverage to Fina for liability arising out of premises that A&amp;B occupied or for\r\nA&amp;B’s work for Fina, but that the second paragraph withheld coverage from Fina for liability\r\narising out of any act, error, or omission of Fina.  In other words, Continental’s position is\r\nthat the policy excluded coverage for Fina’s own negligence.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>An insurer’s duty to defend is determined under the “eight-corners” rule by looking\r\nto the allegations in the pleadings and the language of the insurance policy.  <i>Nat’l Union Fire\r\nIns. v. Merchants Fast Motor Lines, Inc.</i>, 939 S.W.2d 139, 141 (Tex. 1997).  In applying the\r\neight-corners rule, a court must give the allegations in the petition a liberal interpretation. \r\n<i>Id.</i>  Generally, the insurer has a duty to defend if the petition potentially states a cause of\r\naction within the policy coverage.  <i>Id</i>.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>In this case, the plain language of the exclusion provided that the additional-insured\r\nendorsement “does not apply to . . . any liability arising out of any act, error or omission of\r\nthe additional insured, or any of its employees.”  Wisdom’s petition did not allege any acts\r\nof negligence or any tortious acts or omissions of A&amp;B.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The only allegation that connected\r\nthe alleged negligence of Fina to the premises occupied by A&amp;B or A&amp;B’s work for or on\r\nbehalf of Fina was the allegation that Fina was negligent in “demanding that A&amp;B proceed\r\nto unload unbanded steel without proper equipment.”  Thus, although Fina’s liability arose\r\nout of the premises occupied by A&amp;B, Fina’s liability also arose solely out of the acts, errors,\r\nor omissions of Fina or its employees.  Therefore, even if Fina was an additional insured at\r\nthe time of the accident, coverage under that endorsement did not apply.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>We sustain Continental’s second issue. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Because we have held that Fina was not an additional insured under A&amp;B’s\r\ncommercial general liability policy on August 14, 1997 and have, alternatively, determined\r\nthat, even if Fina was an additional insured, it was not covered by the policy because of the\r\nexclusion for liability arising from the additional insured’s own negligence, we need not\r\nconsider Continental’s remaining two issues regarding whether Continental’s duty to\r\nindemnify was established as a matter of law and whether Fina was required to segregate its\r\nattorney’s fees.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>II.<span>      </span>Fina’s Appeal</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>In its second issue, Fina contends that the trial court erred in rendering partial \r\nsummary judgment that Continental did not waive its right of subrogation against Fina.  Fina\r\nrecognizes that the endorsement that provided for waiver of subrogation rights required that\r\nthe waiver be in writing.  Fina argues that “substantial summary judgment evidence” of an\r\nagreement in writing to waive subrogation was shown by the written bid by A&amp;B to Fina\r\nproposing to furnish insurance, along with A&amp;B’s awareness that Fina required that\r\nsubrogation rights be waived, and that the reference to insurance in the bid was “intended to\r\nreflect” the agreement to waive subrogation. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Fina’s own argument shows that there was no agreement in writing to waive\r\nsubrogation.  A&amp;B’s bid made a single mention of insurance, with no specific details or\r\nterms.  The bid made no reference at all to subrogation or a waiver.  Because there was no\r\nlanguage that created an ambiguity in the bid, the awareness and intention of A&amp;B and Fina\r\nare irrelevant.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Fina also argues that subrogation of an insurer against its insured has been rejected\r\nin Texas, citing <i>Texas Association of Counties County Government Risk Management Pool\r\nv. Matagorda County</i>, 52 S.W.3d 128 (Tex. 2000).  <i>Texas Association of Counties</i> does not\r\napply to this case.  The subrogation sought by Continental is in connection with moneys paid\r\non Wisdom’s worker’s compensation claim.  Fina was specifically excluded from coverage\r\nas an additional insured on A&amp;B’s worker’s compensation insurance policy.  Therefore,\r\nContinental was not seeking subrogation against its insured.  Furthermore, the waiver\r\nendorsement, by its own terms, applied only to commercial general liability insurance and\r\nowners and contractors protective liability insurance.

Continental\r\nspecifically argues that (1) Fina was not an additional insured and (2) if Fina was an\r\nadditional insured, coverage was excluded for Fina’s claims.

The reverse side of the purchase orders contained terms and\r\nconditions of the sale.  These terms and conditions made no reference to the provision of\r\ninsurance by the seller to the buyer. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>On August 14, 1997, Larry Wisdom, an employee of A&amp;B, was injured when a load\r\nof steel beams, which was being unloaded on the Fina work site, fell.  Wisdom sued Fina and\r\ntwo other corporations who were involved in the work, alleging negligence.  Specifically,\r\nWisdom alleged that Fina was negligent in (1) failing to supervise properly, (2) issuing a\r\npermit to unload unbanded steel with a forklift, (3) failing to supply a cherry picker for\r\nunloading the unbanded steel, (4) rushing the unloading process, (5) failing to supply a safe\r\nworkplace, and (6) allowing an unsafe activity on its premises.  Wisdom did not sue A&amp;B,\r\nhis employer, through whom he was receiving worker’s compensation benefits.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>A&amp;B was insured by Continental under several policies, including worker’s\r\ncompensation insurance and commercial general liability insurance.  As the insurer,\r\nContinental paid medical expenses and wage benefits to Wisdom.  In August 1999, after\r\nlearning of Wisdom’s lawsuit, Continental filed a petition in intervention, asserting a lien in\r\nthe amount of $107,979.04 on the first monies paid to Wisdom, stating that Wisdom\r\ncontinued to receive medical treatment and wage benefits, and seeking judgment of at least\r\n$107,979.04.  Four days later, counsel for Fina sent a letter to A&amp;B, with a copy to\r\nContinental, demanding a defense and indemnity under the terms of the certificate of\r\ninsurance.  On September 16, 1999, Fina sent a letter by fax to Continental, with a copy to\r\nA&amp;B, reiterating Fina’s demand for a defense and indemnity.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Fina filed a counterclaim to Continental’s petition in intervention, alleging that Fina\r\nwas an additional insured under A&amp;B’s insurance policies and asserting that Continental had\r\nbreached its duties under the policies by refusing to defend and indemnify Fina and by\r\nseeking to enforce a lien against Fina for benefits paid to Wisdom.  Continental generally\r\ndenied Fina’s allegations.  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.  Continental\r\ncontended that Fina was not an additional insured under A&amp;B’s insurance policies and that\r\nContinental did not waive its subrogation rights.  Fina argued that it was an additional\r\ninsured and was entitled to a defense and indemnification and that Continental waived its\r\nsubrogation rights.  The trial court granted both motions in part, declaring that Fina was an\r\nadditional insured under the policy on the date of Wisdom’s accident and that Continental\r\ndid not waive its subrogation rights.  Meanwhile, Fina and the two other defendants in the\r\nunderlying lawsuit settled with Wisdom.  Fina paid $115,000, and the other defendants paid\r\na total of $122,500.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>After the trial court granted the partial summary judgments, the court granted\r\nContinental’s unopposed motion to sever the breach-of-contract issues from the rest of the\r\ncase.  The issue of attorney’s fees relating to the breach-of-contract issues was tried to the\r\ncourt.  The parties stipulated that Fina’s costs of defense, in the amount of $56,484.75,\r\nrelating to Wisdom’s cause of action were reasonable and necessary.  The trial court awarded\r\nFina $166,269.44 as attorney’s fees and expenses for the trial of the breach-of-contract claim,\r\n$115,000 for settlement of Wisdom’s claim, and $56,484.75 for costs of defense of\r\nWisdom’s claim.  The total award to Fina against Continental, including prejudgment\r\ninterest, was $365,751.61.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>DISCUSSION</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>I.<span>        </span>Standard of Review</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Insurance policies are controlled by rules of interpretation and construction applicable\r\nto contracts generally.  <i>Nat’l Union Fire Ins.

Fina responds that its written\r\nbid dated August 12, 1997, which proposed to “furnish . . . insurance,” became the written\r\ncontract when it was accepted by Fina.  Fina argues that a written bid that is orally accepted\r\nand acted upon constitutes an agreement in writing and that, when a contract has been\r\nreduced to writing, is signed by one of the parties, and is ratified and accepted by both\r\nparties, it is treated as a written instrument that is binding on both parties.  Fina cites <i>J.H.\r\nBeall v.

As between Fina and A&amp;B, the parties could form a written\r\ncontract, a parol contract, or a combination of the two.  The issue in this case is not merely\r\nwhether there was a contract between Fina and A&amp;B, but whether that contract complied\r\nwith the contract of insurance between A&amp;B and Continental. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>To be legally binding, a contract must be sufficiently definite in its terms so that a\r\ncourt can understand the parties’ obligations.  <i>T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v.

The parties must agree upon the material terms of the contract\r\nfor it to be enforceable.  <i>Id.</i>  In the present case, a bid to “furnish . . . insurance,” with\r\nnothing more, cannot be said to embody the material terms of a contract to provide that\r\ninsurance.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>The additional-insured endorsement conditioned the amendment of A&amp;B’s policy\r\nregarding who was an insured on (1) a requirement under a written contract to add another\r\nperson or organization as an additional insured and (2) the issuance of a certificate of\r\ninsurance listing that person or organization as an additional insured.  It may be true, as\r\nargued by Fina, that both Fina and A&amp;B understood that Fina would become an additional\r\ninsured under A&amp;B’s policy and that A&amp;B requested the issuance of a certificate of\r\ninsurance on August 12.  However, neither A&amp;B’s proposal nor Fina’s purchase requisitions\r\nor purchase orders specifically require adding Fina as an additional insured,</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> and the\r\ncertificate of insurance was not issued until August 18, 1997.  Accordingly, we hold that Fina\r\nwas not an additional insured under A&amp;B’s policy on August 14, 1997, the date of Wisdom’s\r\ninjury.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>We sustain Continental’s first issue.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span><span><i>B.<span>       </span>Exclusions</i></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>In its second issue, Continental contends that, even if Fina was an additional insured\r\non August 14, 1997, coverage for Wisdom’s injury was excluded under the policy’s\r\nexclusionary language.  Continental argues that the first of two limitations paragraphs\r\nextended coverage to Fina for liability arising out of premises that A&amp;B occupied or for\r\nA&amp;B’s work for Fina, but that the second paragraph withheld coverage from Fina for liability\r\narising out of any act, error, or omission of Fina.  In other words, Continental’s position is\r\nthat the policy excluded coverage for Fina’s own negligence.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>An insurer’s duty to defend is determined under the “eight-corners” rule by looking\r\nto the allegations in the pleadings and the language of the insurance policy.  <i>Nat’l Union Fire\r\nIns. v. Merchants Fast Motor Lines, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2448540\"><a href=\"/opinion/2448540/nat-union-fire-v-merch-fast-motor-lines/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 141 (Tex. 1997).  In applying the\r\neight-corners rule, a court must give the allegations in the petition a liberal interpretation. \r\n<i>Id.</i>  Generally, the insurer has a duty to defend if the petition potentially states a cause of\r\naction within the policy coverage.  <i>Id</i>.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>In this case, the plain language of the exclusion provided that the additional-insured\r\nendorsement “does not apply to . . . any liability arising out of any act, error or omission of\r\nthe additional insured, or any of its employees.”  Wisdom’s petition did not allege any acts\r\nof negligence or any tortious acts or omissions of A&amp;B.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The only allegation that connected\r\nthe alleged negligence of Fina to the premises occupied by A&amp;B or A&amp;B’s work for or on\r\nbehalf of Fina was the allegation that Fina was negligent in “demanding that A&amp;B proceed\r\nto unload unbanded steel without proper equipment.”  Thus, although Fina’s liability arose\r\nout of the premises occupied by A&amp;B, Fina’s liability also arose solely out of the acts, errors,\r\nor omissions of Fina or its employees.  Therefore, even if Fina was an additional insured at\r\nthe time of the accident, coverage under that endorsement did not apply.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>We sustain Continental’s second issue. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Because we have held that Fina was not an additional insured under A&amp;B’s\r\ncommercial general liability policy on August 14, 1997 and have, alternatively, determined\r\nthat, even if Fina was an additional insured, it was not covered by the policy because of the\r\nexclusion for liability arising from the additional insured’s own negligence, we need not\r\nconsider Continental’s remaining two issues regarding whether Continental’s duty to\r\nindemnify was established as a matter of law and whether Fina was required to segregate its\r\nattorney’s fees.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>II.<span>      </span>Fina’s Appeal</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>In its second issue, Fina contends that the trial court erred in rendering partial \r\nsummary judgment that Continental did not waive its right of subrogation against Fina.  Fina\r\nrecognizes that the endorsement that provided for waiver of subrogation rights required that\r\nthe waiver be in writing.  Fina argues that “substantial summary judgment evidence” of an\r\nagreement in writing to waive subrogation was shown by the written bid by A&amp;B to Fina\r\nproposing to furnish insurance, along with A&amp;B’s awareness that Fina required that\r\nsubrogation rights be waived, and that the reference to insurance in the bid was “intended to\r\nreflect” the agreement to waive subrogation. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Fina’s own argument shows that there was no agreement in writing to waive\r\nsubrogation.  A&amp;B’s bid made a single mention of insurance, with no specific details or\r\nterms.  The bid made no reference at all to subrogation or a waiver.  Because there was no\r\nlanguage that created an ambiguity in the bid, the awareness and intention of A&amp;B and Fina\r\nare irrelevant.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Fina also argues that subrogation of an insurer against its insured has been rejected\r\nin Texas, citing <i>Texas Association of Counties County Government Risk Management Pool\r\nv. Matagorda County</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></span> (Tex. 2000).  <i>Texas Association of Counties</i> does not\r\napply to this case.  The subrogation sought by Continental is in connection with moneys paid\r\non Wisdom’s worker’s compensation claim.  Fina was specifically excluded from coverage\r\nas an additional insured on A&amp;B’s worker’s compensation insurance policy.  Therefore,\r\nContinental was not seeking subrogation against its insured.  Furthermore, the waiver\r\nendorsement, by its own terms, applied only to commercial general liability insurance and\r\nowners and contractors protective liability insurance.  Accordingly, the trial court did not err\r\nin granting Continental’s motion for partial summary judgment on the ground that\r\nContinental did not waive subrogation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>We overrule Fina’s second issue.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>Because we have sustained Continental’s first two issues, we need not reach Fina’s\r\nfirst issue, which challenges the trial court’s denial of Fina’s pre-tender defense costs.  </span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>CONCLUSION</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>           </span>We reverse the judgment and render judgment that Fina take nothing by way of its suit\r\nagainst Continental. </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                                  </span>Sam Nuchia</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                                  </span>Justice</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Panel consists of Justices Hedges, Nuchia, and Keyes.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Justice Keyes concurring.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
