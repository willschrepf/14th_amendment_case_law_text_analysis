Maribel Lebrón and Francisco\n\nPortales, parents of K.F.P.L. (\"the child\"), sued the Commonwealth\n\nof Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico Department of Education (\"DOE\")1\n\nunder       numerous       state     and     federal    statutes    for      alleged\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation against their disabled child.                     The\n\ndistrict court dismissed all the claims against the Commonwealth,\n\nand the parents appeal on various grounds.\n\n                 For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\n\n                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n                 We recite the facts as they are alleged in the complaint.\n\n                 In    2008,   the   child    was    diagnosed   with   Asperger's\n\nSyndrome, a form of autism that neither party disputes is a\n\ndisability.           In anticipation of enrolling the five year old in\n\nschool for the first time, the parents registered him with the DOE\n\nin 2008.\n\n                 Before school started, Lebrón, the child's mother, met\n\nwith       the   DOE's    Special    Education      Supervisor   regarding    school\n\nplacement.            From the beginning, the parents and the DOE butted\n\nheads about how to satisfy the child's educational needs.                     Lebrón\n\ntold the Supervisor in that initial meeting that the child's\n\npsychologist had recommended placement in a group of six or fewer\n\n\n       1\n      We refer to the appellants collectively as \"the parents\" and\nthe appellees collectively as \"the Commonwealth.\"\n     While the parents sued a number of defendants, none of the\nothers are involved in this appeal. We, therefore, address only\nthe Commonwealth defendants in this opinion.\n\n                                             -3-\n\fchildren.    The Supervisor said outright that the DOE would not\n\nfollow that recommendation.    Nor would the DOE provide the child\n\nwith certain vision therapy Lebrón requested.           Despite these\n\ndisagreements, on July 14, 2008, the DOE provided the child his\n\nfirst Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\")--a requirement for\n\nevery disabled public school student.2\n\n            For reasons not specifically pleaded, around September\n\n2008, the parents began to search for a school in a different area\n\nof Puerto Rico.   The DOE recommended the parents consider Colegio\n\nTaller de Inteligencia Emocional (\"Colegio\"), a private school.\n\nLebrón visited Colegio and met with the owner, Marlyn Mendez.\n\nLebrón   explained   to   Mendez   the   child's   medical   diagnoses,\n\ntreatments, and special education needs, including the importance\n\nof his placement with a small group of children.      Mendez indicated\n\nthat she was able to accommodate the child, and the parents decided\n\nto forego public schooling and enroll the child at Colegio.\n\n            The parents were pleased with Colegio until 2010.      That\n\nsummer, the child began a biomedical treatment that required him to\n\neat a special diet. Lebrón requested that when the new school year\n\nstarted, she be permitted to go to the school to give the child his\n\nlunch each day, until he adapted to his new dietary regime.        The\n\n\n     2\n       It is unclear from the complaint when, exactly, the DOE\ncompleted the first IEP; at one point, the parents allege the IEP\nwas in place on July 14, 2008, but on the next page allege that the\nfirst IEP was not done until August 28, 2008. The discrepancy is\nnot material to our outcome.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fschool \"sternly prohibited\" Lebrón from giving the child his lunch\n\nin the cafeteria, where the other children ate, instead requiring\n\nthat she do so in the playroom.             Other problems with the school\n\n(the details of which we need not get into) intensified, and Lebrón\n\nscheduled a meeting with the president of Colegio, Edwin Cano, to\n\ndiscuss what she considered \"discriminatory treatment\" on the part\n\nof Colegio's administration.\n\n            Colegio apparently failed to allay the parents' concerns.\n\nFed   up,   the   parents   brought   their    complaints   to   the   DOE   by\n\nattempting to file an administrative complaint against Colegio.\n\nMaria Melendez, a DOE supervisor, told the parents in a March 8,\n\n2011 meeting that the DOE could not help them because Colegio was\n\na private school.\n\n            Dissatisfied with both Colegio and the DOE, the parents\n\nfiled suit in the Puerto Rico District Court on February 29, 2012,\n\nalleging that the defendants3 violated the Fourteenth Amendment;\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1400 et seq.; and a number of other federal statutes: (1) 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1981; (2) 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (3) 42 U.S.C. § 1988; (4) the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.;\n\n(5) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et\n\nseq.; and (6) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Rehabilitation\n\n\n      3\n       In addition to the Commonwealth, the parents sued Colegio,\nMendez, Cano, and the Cano-Mendez conjugal partnership (\"the\nColegio defendants\"), as well as two unnamed insurance companies.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fAct\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794.             The complaint also sought relief under\n\nnumerous     Puerto    Rico    laws:       Article   2   of    the    Puerto    Rico\n\nConstitution; Articles 1054 and 1802 of the Civil Code of Puerto\n\nRico; and Law 44 of July 2, 1985, as amended, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n1, § 501 et seq.4       The parents asked for $500,000 for each of the\n\nthree plaintiffs for emotional distress; $500,000 for each of the\n\nthree plaintiffs in compensatory damages; $1 million for each of\n\nthe three plaintiffs in punitive damages; $500,000 in fees; and\n\n$10,000    in   reimbursement        for    expenses     incurred     for     private\n\nschooling.\n\n             The Commonwealth moved to dismiss, pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6), all the claims against it on May 4, 2012.                         On\n\nJune 20, 2012, in a brief, one-paragraph decision, the district\n\ncourt dismissed all but the IDEA claim, holding that the \"IDEA bars\n\nall other claims against the Commonwealth\" and the \"IDEA does not\n\nallow claims as to damages against the State.\"                    Concerning the\n\nPuerto Rico state law claims specifically, the court held that\n\nthose causes of action were \"barred under the Eleventh Amendment.\"\n\n             After    what    the    Commonwealth    describes       as   a   harried\n\ndiscovery    process,    on    April       10,   2013,   the   parents      moved   to\n\n\n\n     4\n       The complaint inconsistently cites various Puerto Rico Civil\nCode Article numbers and statutory provisions. Given the nature of\nthe claims in this case, as well as the parents' briefing, we\ndeduce that the parents intended to plead claims for relief under\nArticle 1054 (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3018), and Article 1802\n(P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141), which are negligence statutes.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fvoluntarily    withdraw     their   remaining   IDEA   claim   against   the\n\nCommonwealth.    The court allowed that motion, and the Commonwealth\n\nwas dismissed from the lawsuit.\n\n            On January 16, 2013, the Colegio defendants moved for\n\njudgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).             The\n\ncourt allowed that motion on May 14, 2013.         The parents thereafter\n\nmoved for a reconsideration of the Colegio dismissal.5              In the\n\nmotion to reconsider, the parents also asserted (albeit in one\n\nparagraph of a 30-page motion) that they \"disagree[d] with the\n\nCourt's decision to dismiss the remaining causes of action in favor\n\nof   the   Commonwealth.\"      Addressing   that   lone   contention,    the\n\ndistrict court held that because the parents offered \"no new\n\narguments, revelation of clear error, discovery of important, new\n\nfacts, or compelling jurisprudence,\" it would not reconsider its\n\ndismissal of the claims against the Commonwealth.\n\n            The parents timely appealed, and now here we are.\n\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            We review a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state\n\na claim de novo.    Woods v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 733 F.3d 349,\n\n353 (1st Cir. 2013).         Our well-established standard of review\n\nmandates that we \"[s]et[] aside any statements that are merely\n\n\n\n      5\n       The parents styled the motion as a \"Motion to Amend/Correct\nMemorandum Opinion,\" but given that neither party seems to dispute\nthat the motion sought reconsideration, we follow the district\ncourt's lead in treating the motion as one to reconsider.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fconclusory\" and take a complaint's factual allegations as true to\n\n\"determine if there exists a plausible claim upon which relief may\n\nbe granted.\"6       Id.     We make reasonable inferences, drawn from the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint, in the pleader's favor.                    Ocasio-\n\nHernández v. Fortuño-Burset, 640 F.3d 1, 12-13 (1st Cir. 2011).\n\n                                    III. DISCUSSION\n\n                                 A. The Federal Claims\n\n             To frame our analysis, we first provide some background\n\non a centerpiece of this lawsuit--the IDEA.\n\n             As   we      have    previously    emphasized,    the      IDEA   is   a\n\n\"comprehensive statutory scheme\" intended \"to ensure that all\n\nchildren     with      disabilities      have   available     to   them    a   free\n\nappropriate public education.\"               Frazier v. Fairhaven Sch. Comm.,\n\n276   F.3d    52,      58      (1st   Cir.    2002)   (quoting     20    U.S.C.     §\n\n1400(d)(1)(A)).           To      protect this statutory right, the IDEA\n\nrequires public school systems to guarantee disabled children and\n\ntheir parents certain procedural safeguards, such as a right to an\n\nadministrative hearing if a parent disagrees with the school\n\ndistrict's educational plan for a child.              Id.\n\n             In stride with this comprehensive scheme, the IDEA limits\n\nthe remedies available to those aggrieved by a school district's\n\nfailure to provide a disabled child with a free appropriate public\n\n\n      6\n      We note that the standard of review articulated in Conley v.\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957), which is relied upon in the parents'\nbrief, is no longer good law, and has not been for several years.\n\n                                          -8-\n\feducation.    For instance, the only monetary damages plaintiffs may\n\nrecover for an IDEA claim is reimbursement for expenses they\n\nincurred for private schooling. Díaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico, 451\n\nF.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n             Plaintiffs in the past have tried to get around the\n\nIDEA's limited remedies, as well as its other restrictions, by\n\nsuing under other federal statutes, such as § 1983, the ADA, and\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act.        But our existing jurisprudence is clear\n\nthat \"where the underlying claim is one of violation of the IDEA,\n\nplaintiffs may not use § 1983--or any other federal statute for\n\nthat matter--in an attempt to evade the limited remedial structure\n\nof the IDEA.\"     Id. at 29.\n\n             Still, Congress has clarified that the IDEA does not\n\nrestrict plaintiffs' right to sue under other statutes, so long as\n\ntheir cases do not \"turn[] entirely on the rights created by\n\nstatute in the IDEA.\"     Id.    Specifically, the IDEA provides:\n\n             [n]othing in this chapter shall be construed\n             to restrict or limit the rights, procedures,\n             and remedies available under the Constitution,\n             the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n             title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or\n             other Federal laws protecting the rights of\n             children with disabilities.\n\nM.M.R.-Z. ex rel. Ramírez-Senda v. Puerto Rico, 528 F.3d 9, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l)).      Thus, denying a child a\n\nfree appropriate public education on account of his disability\n\ncould, for instance, be a valid basis for a claim under either the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fRehabilitation Act or the ADA, even if the factual basis for those\n\nclaims might overlap with that of an IDEA claim.               D.B. ex rel.\n\nElizabeth B. v. Esposito, 675 F.3d 26, 40 (1st Cir. 2012).\n\n               Against that backdrop, the parents in the instant case\n\nhave argued that the district court erred in dismissing their non-\n\nIDEA claims because their complaint sufficiently stated disability-\n\nbased       discrimination   and   retaliation   under   the   ADA   and   the\n\nRehabilitation Act, both of which \"prohibit discrimination against\n\nan otherwise qualified individual based on his or her disability.\"7\n\nCalero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).       The Commonwealth disagrees, and urges us to affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal; in the Commonwealth's estimation, the\n\nADA, Rehabilitation Act, and other federal statutes \"cannot be used\n\nto remediate what is essentially a claim seeking remedy under\n\n\n\n\n        7\n       While the parents brought claims under numerous federal\nstatutes, we focus our analysis on the disability-based\ndiscrimination and retaliation claims asserted under the ADA, the\nRehabilitation Act, and § 1983.      The other claims we can more\nquickly dispose of. First, both 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and 42 U.S.C. §\n2000d prohibit race-based discrimination. The complaint provides\nno factual support for such a theory; the only mention of race or\nnational origin in the complaint is the allegation stating that the\nchild \"is of American nationality, of Caucasian race, and suffers\nfrom Asperger's Syndrome.\" We, therefore, affirm the dismissal of\nthese claims for inadequate pleading. Finally, the provision of 42\nU.S.C. § 1988 under which the parents seek relief--subsection (b)--\nis merely a vehicle by which the parents could have collected\nattorney's fees for a successful § 1983 claim. As discussed below,\nwe affirm the dismissal of the § 1983 claim, and therefore, §\n1988(b) can provide the parents no relief.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fIDEA.\"8\n\n          As we explain below, we find that regardless of whether\n\nthe parents' claims overlay completely with their IDEA claim, the\n\nparents have not sufficiently pleaded either discrimination or\n\nretaliation.   Therefore, dismissal of the ADA, Rehabilitation Act,\n\nand § 1983 claims was proper.\n\n          1. The Discrimination and Retaliation Claims\n\n          The only facts in the complaint that even reference the\n\nCommonwealth aver that (1) the DOE created the child's IEP in 2008,\n\nand (2) when the parents sought to file an administrative complaint\n\nagainst Colegio some three years later, the DOE said it \"couldn't\n\ndo anything since [Colegio] was a private school.\"   Neither party\n\ndisputes that the parents, on their own accord, abandoned public\n\nschooling and enrolled the child at the private school in 2008.\n\nAnd neither party disputes that the parents fault Colegio's staff\n\nfor treating the child in a discriminatory manner while he was\n\nenrolled there.\n\n          Given this set of facts, we had trouble even identifying\n\nfrom the complaint the parents' discrimination-based theory of\n\nliability against the Commonwealth.    Searching for guidance, we\n\n\n\n     8\n       As noted above, the district court held only that the \"IDEA\nbars all other claims against the Commonwealth\" and that the \"IDEA\ndoes not allow claims as to damages against the State.\"        The\ndistrict court did not elaborate its reasoning any further, and we\ninterpret the decision to adopt the rationale pressed by the\nCommonwealth on appeal.\n\n                                -11-\n\ftenaciously waded through the sea of scattered, convoluted, and\n\noften irrelevant prose that comprised the parents' 44-page opening\n\nbrief.   The puzzle persisted.\n\n           So, at oral argument we resolved to ask counsel (multiple\n\ntimes) to identify even the \"flavor\" of the parents' asserted\n\ntheory of liability for the non-IDEA claims.       We specifically\n\nasked--\"What did the Commonwealth do that's wrong?\"\n\n           Counsel told us that the non-IDEA claims do not rest on\n\nthe child's unmet educational needs.    Rather, counsel urged, they\n\nturn on the Commonwealth's refusal to allow the parents to file a\n\ncomplaint against Colegio after the parents reported Colegio's\n\ndiscriminatory \"segregation\" of the child and its failure to\n\naccommodate the child's special dietary needs.     The Commonwealth\n\nshould have responded to these complaints, counsel argued, because\n\nthe government is required to supervise organizations that receive\n\npublic grant money.\n\n           Accepting the parents' interpretation of their pleading\n\nat face value, we explore whether these theories sufficiently state\n\na claim for discrimination or retaliation.\n\n           First, we are not convinced by the parents' argument that\n\nthe DOE should have \"supervised\" Colegio simply because Colegio\n\nreceived federal funds.    The parents provide us with no law or\n\nother reasoning to support the legal proposition that a private\n\nschool acts as an agent of a state educational agency solely\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fbecause the school may generally receive public grant money.     \"It\n\nis not our job to put flesh on the bare bones of an underdeveloped\n\nargument.\"     United States v. Mathur, 624 F.3d 498, 508 (1st Cir.\n\n2010) (citation omitted). We consider this argument waived for our\n\npurposes.\n\n             More fatal to the parents' case, the pleaded allegations\n\nconcerning the Commonwealth do not otherwise sufficiently state a\n\nclaim for discrimination or retaliation under the ADA or the\n\nRehabilitation Act.      The parents alleged that the Commonwealth\n\nengaged in \"intentional discrimination\" against the child.        To\n\nstate a claim for intentional discrimination under either statute,\n\nthe parents need have pleaded that the Commonwealth engaged in some\n\nwrongful action because of the child's disability.         Parker v.\n\nUniversidad de Puerto Rico, 225 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000); Lesley\n\nv. Hee Man Chie, 250 F.3d 47, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2001).   The complaint\n\nmisses the mark.    The parents have provided no factual allegations\n\nthat would support any inference, let alone a reasonable one, that\n\nthe Commonwealth or any of its agents intentionally discriminated\n\nagainst the child because he was disabled.      Simply alleging in a\n\nconclusory fashion that the defendants engaged in \"intentional\n\ndiscrimination,\" as does the complaint here, is not enough to\n\nsatisfy the pleading standard.     Ocasio-Hernández, 640 F.3d at 13.\n\n             To establish a prima facie claim for retaliation under\n\nthe ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, the parents would have to show\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fthat they \"engaged in protected conduct,\"9 were \"subjected to an\n\nadverse      action   by    the    defendant,\"     and     \"there    was   a   causal\n\nconnection between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\"\n\nEsposito, 675 F.3d at 41.          The parents provide no facts that would\n\nallow us to plausibly infer that the DOE's refusal to file an\n\nadministrative complaint against Colegio was causally related to\n\nthe    parents'    decision       to    complain   about    Colegio's      allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory behavior, as opposed to the DOE's belief that it\n\ncould not take action against a private school.                    See M.M.R.-Z. ex\n\nrel.       Ramírez-Senda,    528       F.3d   at   15    (noting    that   ADA   and\n\nRehabilitation Act retaliation claims \"rest on improper retaliatory\n\nintent\").      The parents also made no effort in their briefing or at\n\noral argument to illuminate the rationale they expect us to adopt.\n\n              For all of these reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndismissal of the parents' ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. Given\n\nsuch holding, we further affirm dismissal of the § 1983 claim,10 as\n\nthe parents predicated it upon the failed discrimination claims.\n\n                            2. The Reconsideration\n\n              In a last-ditch effort, the parents also argue that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by dismissing their non-IDEA\n\n\n\n       9\n       Protected conduct includes advocating for a student's right\nto be free from disability-based discrimination. Esposito, 675\nF.3d at 41.\n       10\n       Section 1983 is the statutory vehicle by which plaintiffs\nmay sue for violations of their constitutional rights.\n\n                                          -14-\n\fclaims with prejudice, failing to take into account the \"material\n\nfacts\" they brought forth after voluntarily withdrawing their IDEA\n\nclaim.   See Tell v. Trs. of Dartmouth Coll., 145 F.3d 417, 419-20\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).      The parents, however, did not see fit to share\n\nwith us what those material facts actually were.         A district court\n\n\"exceeds its discretion when it fails to consider a significant\n\nfactor in its decisional calculus, if it relies on an improper\n\nfactor in computing that calculus, or if it considers all of the\n\nappropriate factors but makes a serious mistake in weighing such\n\nfactors.\"    Colón Cabrera v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (Puerto Rico),\n\nInc., 723 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir. 2013) (quotations omitted).           Given\n\nthat the parents' brief directs us to nothing, be it fact or law,\n\nthat they brought to the district court's attention, or would\n\notherwise support a finding that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion, we affirm the denial of the reconsideration.\n\n                        B. The State Law Claims\n\n            Finally, the district court also dismissed the Puerto\n\nRico claims, on the ground that the parents were \"barred under the\n\nEleventh Amendment\" from hauling the Commonwealth into federal\n\ncourt.      The   parents   argue,   however,   that   the   Commonwealth's\n\nsovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment is waived because\n\nPuerto Rico accepts federal funds for disabled students.\n\n            Unless a state consents, \"a suit in which the State or\n\none of its agencies or departments is named as the defendant is\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fproscribed by the Eleventh Amendment.\"           Díaz-Fonseca, 451 F.3d at\n\n33 (quotations omitted).       \"The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is\n\ntreated as a state for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nanalysis.\"    Id.   \"The Commonwealth can waive its immunity in three\n\nways: (1) by a clear declaration that it intends to submit itself\n\nto the jurisdiction of a federal court . . . ; (2) by consent to or\n\nparticipation in a federal program for which waiver of immunity is\n\nan express condition; or (3) by affirmative conduct in litigation.\"\n\nId. (quotations omitted).\n\n             As noted in the parents' brief, we previously held that\n\nPuerto Rico does not have Eleventh Amendment immunity against the\n\nfederal IDEA and Rehabilitation Act claims because it accepts\n\nfederal funds for those programs.      Id.       But that holding relied on\n\nparticular statutory language.             See   id.   (citing 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1403(a), which conditions a state's receiving federal IDEA funds on\n\nconsent to suit, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d–7(a)(1), which provides for\n\nsame under the Rehabilitation Act).         This principle does not apply\n\nto Puerto Rico's general negligence statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n31,   §   5141.     Díaz-Fonseca,   451     F.3d    at   33   (\"Although   the\n\nCommonwealth has consented to be sued for damages in actions\n\nbrought under the Commonwealth general negligence statute, such\n\nconsent does not extend to actions filed in any courts but the\n\nCommonwealth's own.\").     Law 104 (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, § 3077),\n\nwhich authorizes certain negligence suits against the Commonwealth\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fin state trial courts, \"does not extend that waiver to suits filed\n\nin federal court.\"11   Díaz-Fonseca, 451 F.3d at 33.   And, as far as\n\nwe can tell, Law 44 (Puerto Rico's version of the ADA) contains no\n\nstatutory waiver of immunity from federal court lawsuits.     All in\n\nall, the parents offer no authority (or reasoning) why sovereign\n\nimmunity would not extend to the Puerto Rico causes of action\n\nbrought in this case under state law.12   Thus, any argument in this\n\nregard is waived for lack of development, and we affirm the\n\ndismissal of the Puerto Rico claims.\n\n                           IV. CONCLUSION\n\n          For all of the reasons discussed above, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n        As we mentioned above, it is not obvious from the complaint\nunder which state statutory provisions the parents intended to\nplead claims for relief. Regardless of what they had in mind, the\nparents have provided no basis for statutory (or other) waiver of\nthe Commonwealth's sovereign immunity under any state cause of\naction.\n     12\n        Given the parents' failure to assert otherwise, we assume,\nas we have in the past, that the \"DOE's Eleventh Amendment immunity\nis coextensive with that of the Commonwealth's.\" Díaz-Fonseca, 451\nF.3d at 34.\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

Maribel Lebrón and Francisco\n\nPortales, parents of K.F.P.L. (\"the child\"), sued the Commonwealth\n\nof Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico Department of Education (\"DOE\")1\n\nunder       numerous       state     and     federal    statutes    for      alleged\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation against their disabled child.                     The\n\ndistrict court dismissed all the claims against the Commonwealth,\n\nand the parents appeal on various grounds.\n\n                 For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\n\n                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n                 We recite the facts as they are alleged in the complaint.\n\n                 In    2008,   the   child    was    diagnosed   with   Asperger's\n\nSyndrome, a form of autism that neither party disputes is a\n\ndisability.           In anticipation of enrolling the five year old in\n\nschool for the first time, the parents registered him with the DOE\n\nin 2008.\n\n                 Before school started, Lebrón, the child's mother, met\n\nwith       the   DOE's    Special    Education      Supervisor   regarding    school\n\nplacement.            From the beginning, the parents and the DOE butted\n\nheads about how to satisfy the child's educational needs.                     Lebrón\n\ntold the Supervisor in that initial meeting that the child's\n\npsychologist had recommended placement in a group of six or fewer\n\n\n       1\n      We refer to the appellants collectively as \"the parents\" and\nthe appellees collectively as \"the Commonwealth.\"\n     While the parents sued a number of defendants, none of the\nothers are involved in this appeal. We, therefore, address only\nthe Commonwealth defendants in this opinion.\n\n                                             -3-\n\fchildren.    The Supervisor said outright that the DOE would not\n\nfollow that recommendation.    Nor would the DOE provide the child\n\nwith certain vision therapy Lebrón requested.           Despite these\n\ndisagreements, on July 14, 2008, the DOE provided the child his\n\nfirst Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\")--a requirement for\n\nevery disabled public school student.2\n\n            For reasons not specifically pleaded, around September\n\n2008, the parents began to search for a school in a different area\n\nof Puerto Rico.   The DOE recommended the parents consider Colegio\n\nTaller de Inteligencia Emocional (\"Colegio\"), a private school.\n\nLebrón visited Colegio and met with the owner, Marlyn Mendez.\n\nLebrón   explained   to   Mendez   the   child's   medical   diagnoses,\n\ntreatments, and special education needs, including the importance\n\nof his placement with a small group of children.      Mendez indicated\n\nthat she was able to accommodate the child, and the parents decided\n\nto forego public schooling and enroll the child at Colegio.\n\n            The parents were pleased with Colegio until 2010.      That\n\nsummer, the child began a biomedical treatment that required him to\n\neat a special diet. Lebrón requested that when the new school year\n\nstarted, she be permitted to go to the school to give the child his\n\nlunch each day, until he adapted to his new dietary regime.        The\n\n\n     2\n       It is unclear from the complaint when, exactly, the DOE\ncompleted the first IEP; at one point, the parents allege the IEP\nwas in place on July 14, 2008, but on the next page allege that the\nfirst IEP was not done until August 28, 2008. The discrepancy is\nnot material to our outcome.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fschool \"sternly prohibited\" Lebrón from giving the child his lunch\n\nin the cafeteria, where the other children ate, instead requiring\n\nthat she do so in the playroom.             Other problems with the school\n\n(the details of which we need not get into) intensified, and Lebrón\n\nscheduled a meeting with the president of Colegio, Edwin Cano, to\n\ndiscuss what she considered \"discriminatory treatment\" on the part\n\nof Colegio's administration.\n\n            Colegio apparently failed to allay the parents' concerns.\n\nFed   up,   the   parents   brought   their    complaints   to   the   DOE   by\n\nattempting to file an administrative complaint against Colegio.\n\nMaria Melendez, a DOE supervisor, told the parents in a March 8,\n\n2011 meeting that the DOE could not help them because Colegio was\n\na private school.\n\n            Dissatisfied with both Colegio and the DOE, the parents\n\nfiled suit in the Puerto Rico District Court on February 29, 2012,\n\nalleging that the defendants3 violated the Fourteenth Amendment;\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1400 et seq.; and a number of other federal statutes: (1) 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1981; (2) 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (3) 42 U.S.C. § 1988; (4) the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.;\n\n(5) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et\n\nseq.; and (6) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Rehabilitation\n\n\n      3\n       In addition to the Commonwealth, the parents sued Colegio,\nMendez, Cano, and the Cano-Mendez conjugal partnership (\"the\nColegio defendants\"), as well as two unnamed insurance companies.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fAct\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794.             The complaint also sought relief under\n\nnumerous     Puerto    Rico    laws:       Article   2   of    the    Puerto    Rico\n\nConstitution; Articles 1054 and 1802 of the Civil Code of Puerto\n\nRico; and Law 44 of July 2, 1985, as amended, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n1, § 501 et seq.4       The parents asked for $500,000 for each of the\n\nthree plaintiffs for emotional distress; $500,000 for each of the\n\nthree plaintiffs in compensatory damages; $1 million for each of\n\nthe three plaintiffs in punitive damages; $500,000 in fees; and\n\n$10,000    in   reimbursement        for    expenses     incurred     for     private\n\nschooling.\n\n             The Commonwealth moved to dismiss, pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6), all the claims against it on May 4, 2012.                         On\n\nJune 20, 2012, in a brief, one-paragraph decision, the district\n\ncourt dismissed all but the IDEA claim, holding that the \"IDEA bars\n\nall other claims against the Commonwealth\" and the \"IDEA does not\n\nallow claims as to damages against the State.\"                    Concerning the\n\nPuerto Rico state law claims specifically, the court held that\n\nthose causes of action were \"barred under the Eleventh Amendment.\"\n\n             After    what    the    Commonwealth    describes       as   a   harried\n\ndiscovery    process,    on    April       10,   2013,   the   parents      moved   to\n\n\n\n     4\n       The complaint inconsistently cites various Puerto Rico Civil\nCode Article numbers and statutory provisions. Given the nature of\nthe claims in this case, as well as the parents' briefing, we\ndeduce that the parents intended to plead claims for relief under\nArticle 1054 (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3018), and Article 1802\n(P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141), which are negligence statutes.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fvoluntarily    withdraw     their   remaining   IDEA   claim   against   the\n\nCommonwealth.    The court allowed that motion, and the Commonwealth\n\nwas dismissed from the lawsuit.\n\n            On January 16, 2013, the Colegio defendants moved for\n\njudgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).             The\n\ncourt allowed that motion on May 14, 2013.         The parents thereafter\n\nmoved for a reconsideration of the Colegio dismissal.5              In the\n\nmotion to reconsider, the parents also asserted (albeit in one\n\nparagraph of a 30-page motion) that they \"disagree[d] with the\n\nCourt's decision to dismiss the remaining causes of action in favor\n\nof   the   Commonwealth.\"      Addressing   that   lone   contention,    the\n\ndistrict court held that because the parents offered \"no new\n\narguments, revelation of clear error, discovery of important, new\n\nfacts, or compelling jurisprudence,\" it would not reconsider its\n\ndismissal of the claims against the Commonwealth.\n\n            The parents timely appealed, and now here we are.\n\n                          II.

DISCUSSION\n\n                                 A. The Federal Claims\n\n             To frame our analysis, we first provide some background\n\non a centerpiece of this lawsuit--the IDEA.\n\n             As   we      have    previously    emphasized,    the      IDEA   is   a\n\n\"comprehensive statutory scheme\" intended \"to ensure that all\n\nchildren     with      disabilities      have   available     to   them    a   free\n\nappropriate public education.\"               Frazier v.

To      protect this statutory right, the IDEA\n\nrequires public school systems to guarantee disabled children and\n\ntheir parents certain procedural safeguards, such as a right to an\n\nadministrative hearing if a parent disagrees with the school\n\ndistrict's educational plan for a child.              Id.\n\n             In stride with this comprehensive scheme, the IDEA limits\n\nthe remedies available to those aggrieved by a school district's\n\nfailure to provide a disabled child with a free appropriate public\n\n\n      6\n      We note that the standard of review articulated in Conley v.\nGibson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1957), which is relied upon in the parents'\nbrief, is no longer good law, and has not been for several years.\n\n                                          -8-\n\feducation.

But our existing jurisprudence is clear\n\nthat \"where the underlying claim is one of violation of the IDEA,\n\nplaintiffs may not use § 1983--or any other federal statute for\n\nthat matter--in an attempt to evade the limited remedial structure\n\nof the IDEA.\"     Id. at 29.\n\n             Still, Congress has clarified that the IDEA does not\n\nrestrict plaintiffs' right to sue under other statutes, so long as\n\ntheir cases do not \"turn[] entirely on the rights created by\n\nstatute in the IDEA.\"     Id.

The Commonwealth disagrees, and urges us to affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal; in the Commonwealth's estimation, the\n\nADA, Rehabilitation Act, and other federal statutes \"cannot be used\n\nto remediate what is essentially a claim seeking remedy under\n\n\n\n\n        7\n       While the parents brought claims under numerous federal\nstatutes, we focus our analysis on the disability-based\ndiscrimination and retaliation claims asserted under the ADA, the\nRehabilitation Act, and § 1983.      The other claims we can more\nquickly dispose of. First, both 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and 42 U.S.C. §\n2000d prohibit race-based discrimination. The complaint provides\nno factual support for such a theory; the only mention of race or\nnational origin in the complaint is the allegation stating that the\nchild \"is of American nationality, of Caucasian race, and suffers\nfrom Asperger's Syndrome.\" We, therefore, affirm the dismissal of\nthese claims for inadequate pleading. Finally, the provision of 42\nU.S.C. § 1988 under which the parents seek relief--subsection (b)--\nis merely a vehicle by which the parents could have collected\nattorney's fees for a successful § 1983 claim. As discussed below,\nwe affirm the dismissal of the § 1983 claim, and therefore, §\n1988(b) can provide the parents no relief.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fIDEA.\"8\n\n          As we explain below, we find that regardless of whether\n\nthe parents' claims overlay completely with their IDEA claim, the\n\nparents have not sufficiently pleaded either discrimination or\n\nretaliation.   Therefore, dismissal of the ADA, Rehabilitation Act,\n\nand § 1983 claims was proper.\n\n          1. The Discrimination and Retaliation Claims\n\n          The only facts in the complaint that even reference the\n\nCommonwealth aver that (1) the DOE created the child's IEP in 2008,\n\nand (2) when the parents sought to file an administrative complaint\n\nagainst Colegio some three years later, the DOE said it \"couldn't\n\ndo anything since [Colegio] was a private school.\"   Neither party\n\ndisputes that the parents, on their own accord, abandoned public\n\nschooling and enrolled the child at the private school in 2008.\n\nAnd neither party disputes that the parents fault Colegio's staff\n\nfor treating the child in a discriminatory manner while he was\n\nenrolled there.\n\n          Given this set of facts, we had trouble even identifying\n\nfrom the complaint the parents' discrimination-based theory of\n\nliability against the Commonwealth.    Searching for guidance, we\n\n\n\n     8\n       As noted above, the district court held only that the \"IDEA\nbars all other claims against the Commonwealth\" and that the \"IDEA\ndoes not allow claims as to damages against the State.\"        The\ndistrict court did not elaborate its reasoning any further, and we\ninterpret the decision to adopt the rationale pressed by the\nCommonwealth on appeal.\n\n                                -11-\n\ftenaciously waded through the sea of scattered, convoluted, and\n\noften irrelevant prose that comprised the parents' 44-page opening\n\nbrief.   The puzzle persisted.\n\n           So, at oral argument we resolved to ask counsel (multiple\n\ntimes) to identify even the \"flavor\" of the parents' asserted\n\ntheory of liability for the non-IDEA claims.       We specifically\n\nasked--\"What did the Commonwealth do that's wrong?\"\n\n           Counsel told us that the non-IDEA claims do not rest on\n\nthe child's unmet educational needs.    Rather, counsel urged, they\n\nturn on the Commonwealth's refusal to allow the parents to file a\n\ncomplaint against Colegio after the parents reported Colegio's\n\ndiscriminatory \"segregation\" of the child and its failure to\n\naccommodate the child's special dietary needs.     The Commonwealth\n\nshould have responded to these complaints, counsel argued, because\n\nthe government is required to supervise organizations that receive\n\npublic grant money.\n\n           Accepting the parents' interpretation of their pleading\n\nat face value, we explore whether these theories sufficiently state\n\na claim for discrimination or retaliation.\n\n           First, we are not convinced by the parents' argument that\n\nthe DOE should have \"supervised\" Colegio simply because Colegio\n\nreceived federal funds.    The parents provide us with no law or\n\nother reasoning to support the legal proposition that a private\n\nschool acts as an agent of a state educational agency solely\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fbecause the school may generally receive public grant money.     \"It\n\nis not our job to put flesh on the bare bones of an underdeveloped\n\nargument.\"     United States v.

We consider this argument waived for our\n\npurposes.\n\n             More fatal to the parents' case, the pleaded allegations\n\nconcerning the Commonwealth do not otherwise sufficiently state a\n\nclaim for discrimination or retaliation under the ADA or the\n\nRehabilitation Act.      The parents alleged that the Commonwealth\n\nengaged in \"intentional discrimination\" against the child.        To\n\nstate a claim for intentional discrimination under either statute,\n\nthe parents need have pleaded that the Commonwealth engaged in some\n\nwrongful action because of the child's disability.

The complaint\n\nmisses the mark.    The parents have provided no factual allegations\n\nthat would support any inference, let alone a reasonable one, that\n\nthe Commonwealth or any of its agents intentionally discriminated\n\nagainst the child because he was disabled.      Simply alleging in a\n\nconclusory fashion that the defendants engaged in \"intentional\n\ndiscrimination,\" as does the complaint here, is not enough to\n\nsatisfy the pleading standard.     Ocasio-Hernández, 640 F.3d at 13.\n\n             To establish a prima facie claim for retaliation under\n\nthe ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, the parents would have to show\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fthat they \"engaged in protected conduct,\"9 were \"subjected to an\n\nadverse      action   by    the    defendant,\"     and     \"there    was   a   causal\n\nconnection between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\"\n\nEsposito, 675 F.3d at 41.          The parents provide no facts that would\n\nallow us to plausibly infer that the DOE's refusal to file an\n\nadministrative complaint against Colegio was causally related to\n\nthe    parents'    decision       to    complain   about    Colegio's      allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory behavior, as opposed to the DOE's belief that it\n\ncould not take action against a private school.                    See M.M.R.-Z. ex\n\nrel.       Ramírez-Senda,    528       F.3d   at   15    (noting    that   ADA   and\n\nRehabilitation Act retaliation claims \"rest on improper retaliatory\n\nintent\").      The parents also made no effort in their briefing or at\n\noral argument to illuminate the rationale they expect us to adopt.\n\n              For all of these reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndismissal of the parents' ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. Given\n\nsuch holding, we further affirm dismissal of the § 1983 claim,10 as\n\nthe parents predicated it upon the failed discrimination claims.\n\n                            2. The Reconsideration\n\n              In a last-ditch effort, the parents also argue that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by dismissing their non-IDEA\n\n\n\n       9\n       Protected conduct includes advocating for a student's right\nto be free from disability-based discrimination.

The parents, however, did not see fit to share\n\nwith us what those material facts actually were.         A district court\n\n\"exceeds its discretion when it fails to consider a significant\n\nfactor in its decisional calculus, if it relies on an improper\n\nfactor in computing that calculus, or if it considers all of the\n\nappropriate factors but makes a serious mistake in weighing such\n\nfactors.\"    Colón Cabrera v.

Given\n\nthat the parents' brief directs us to nothing, be it fact or law,\n\nthat they brought to the district court's attention, or would\n\notherwise support a finding that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion, we affirm the denial of the reconsideration.\n\n                        B. The State Law Claims\n\n            Finally, the district court also dismissed the Puerto\n\nRico claims, on the ground that the parents were \"barred under the\n\nEleventh Amendment\" from hauling the Commonwealth into federal\n\ncourt.      The   parents   argue,   however,   that   the   Commonwealth's\n\nsovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment is waived because\n\nPuerto Rico accepts federal funds for disabled students.\n\n            Unless a state consents, \"a suit in which the State or\n\none of its agencies or departments is named as the defendant is\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fproscribed by the Eleventh Amendment.\"           Díaz-Fonseca, 451 F.3d at\n\n33 (quotations omitted).       \"The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is\n\ntreated as a state for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nanalysis.\"    Id.   \"The Commonwealth can waive its immunity in three\n\nways: (1) by a clear declaration that it intends to submit itself\n\nto the jurisdiction of a federal court . . . ; (2) by consent to or\n\nparticipation in a federal program for which waiver of immunity is\n\nan express condition; or (3) by affirmative conduct in litigation.\"\n\nId. (quotations omitted).\n\n             As noted in the parents' brief, we previously held that\n\nPuerto Rico does not have Eleventh Amendment immunity against the\n\nfederal IDEA and Rehabilitation Act claims because it accepts\n\nfederal funds for those programs.      Id.       But that holding relied on\n\nparticular statutory language.             See   id.   (citing 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1403(a), which conditions a state's receiving federal IDEA funds on\n\nconsent to suit, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d–7(a)(1), which provides for\n\nsame under the Rehabilitation Act).         This principle does not apply\n\nto Puerto Rico's general negligence statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n31,   §   5141.     Díaz-Fonseca,   451     F.3d    at   33   (\"Although   the\n\nCommonwealth has consented to be sued for damages in actions\n\nbrought under the Commonwealth general negligence statute, such\n\nconsent does not extend to actions filed in any courts but the\n\nCommonwealth's own.\").     Law 104 (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, § 3077),\n\nwhich authorizes certain negligence suits against the Commonwealth\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fin state trial courts, \"does not extend that waiver to suits filed\n\nin federal court.\"11   Díaz-Fonseca, 451 F.3d at 33.   And, as far as\n\nwe can tell, Law 44 (Puerto Rico's version of the ADA) contains no\n\nstatutory waiver of immunity from federal court lawsuits.     All in\n\nall, the parents offer no authority (or reasoning) why sovereign\n\nimmunity would not extend to the Puerto Rico causes of action\n\nbrought in this case under state law.12   Thus, any argument in this\n\nregard is waived for lack of development, and we affirm the\n\ndismissal of the Puerto Rico claims.\n\n                           IV. CONCLUSION\n\n          For all of the reasons discussed above, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n        As we mentioned above, it is not obvious from the complaint\nunder which state statutory provisions the parents intended to\nplead claims for relief. Regardless of what they had in mind, the\nparents have provided no basis for statutory (or other) waiver of\nthe Commonwealth's sovereign immunity under any state cause of\naction.\n     12\n        Given the parents' failure to assert otherwise, we assume,\nas we have in the past, that the \"DOE's Eleventh Amendment immunity\nis coextensive with that of the Commonwealth's.\" Díaz-Fonseca, 451\nF.3d at 34.\n\n                                -17-\n\f</pre>",
