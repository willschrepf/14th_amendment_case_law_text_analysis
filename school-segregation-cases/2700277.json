class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>M.H.\r\nwas born in 1996 to Father and Mother and was 12 years old at the time of trial.<span>  </span>M.H.’s grandmother (“Grandmother”) had cared\r\nfor M.H. since M.H. was two years old.<span>  </span>M.H.’s\r\nAunt maintained a household with Grandmother.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>Grandmother\r\nwas named managing conservator of M.H. in 1998.<span> \r\n</span>Father and Mother were named possessory conservators.<span>  </span>In 2001, Grandmother filed a suit to modify the\r\nunderlying SAPCR, and the trial court rendered an order again naming\r\nGrandmother managing conservator of the child and Father and Mother possessory\r\nconservators.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>In\r\n2007, Father sought to modify the 2001 court order providing for\r\nconservatorship of, and child support, for M.H.<span> \r\n</span>Grandmother filed an answer and counter-petition to modify, seeking an\r\nincrease in child support and attorney’s fees.<span> \r\n</span>Grandmother also requested that Father pay for M.H.’s health\r\ninsurance.<span>  </span>Aunt intervened, seeking to\r\nbe named a joint managing conservator with Grandmother, and requested\r\nattorney’s fees.<span>  </span>On the issues of\r\nmanaging and possessory conservatorship and visitation, the parties entered\r\ninto a mediated settlement agreement, the terms of which were incorporated into\r\nthe subsequent modification order.<span>  </span>On\r\nthe issue of conservatorship, Father and Mother were again appointed possessory\r\nconservators of M.H., while Grandmother and Aunt were appointed joint managing\r\nconservators of M.H. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>On\r\nthe issues of child support and attorney’s fees, the parties proceeded to a\r\nbench trial.<span>  </span>Father testified that he\r\nwas employed as a contractor and that his monthly net income was\r\n$2,633.00.<span>  </span>He also testified that he had\r\nreceived a personal injury settlement for injuries sustained in a pipeline\r\nexplosion, totaling approximately $900,000.<span> \r\n</span>Father stated that he had used the settlement proceeds to purchase a\r\nhome for himself and his parents, an automobile, and a boat.<span>  </span>He also stated that he had used the funds to\r\nestablish a college fund for M.H. in the amount of $20,700.00 and to pay back\r\nchild support in an amount of $26,000.00.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>The\r\ntrial court ordered Father to pay to appellees monthly child support in the\r\namount of $1,200.00, to pay Mother’s attorney’s fees in the amount of $7,000, and\r\nto pay Aunt’s attorney’s fees in the amount of $72,433.07. <span> </span>The trial court also entered the following findings\r\nof fact and conclusions of law:<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>(1)<span>            \r\n</span></span></span><span>[Aunt], <span

currently produce income.<span>  </span>The\r\ncourt also considered whether certain property that is not producing income can\r\nbe liquidated without unreasonable financial sacrifice because of cyclical or\r\nother market conditions.<span>  </span>The court also\r\nassigned a reasonable amount of deemed income to income-producing assets that [Father]\r\nmay have voluntarily

class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>M.H.\r\nwas born in 1996 to Father and Mother and was 12 years old at the time of trial.<span>  </span>M.H.’s grandmother (“Grandmother”) had cared\r\nfor M.H. since M.H. was two years old.<span>  </span>M.H.’s\r\nAunt maintained a household with Grandmother.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>Grandmother\r\nwas named managing conservator of M.H. in 1998.<span> \r\n</span>Father and Mother were named possessory conservators.<span>  </span>In 2001, Grandmother filed a suit to modify the\r\nunderlying SAPCR, and the trial court rendered an order again naming\r\nGrandmother managing conservator of the child and Father and Mother possessory\r\nconservators.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>In\r\n2007, Father sought to modify the 2001 court order providing for\r\nconservatorship of, and child support, for M.H.<span> \r\n</span>Grandmother filed an answer and counter-petition to modify, seeking an\r\nincrease in child support and attorney’s fees.<span> \r\n</span>Grandmother also requested that Father pay for M.H.’s health\r\ninsurance.<span>  </span>Aunt intervened, seeking to\r\nbe named a joint managing conservator with Grandmother, and requested\r\nattorney’s fees.<span>  </span>On the issues of\r\nmanaging and possessory conservatorship and visitation, the parties entered\r\ninto a mediated settlement agreement, the terms of which were incorporated into\r\nthe subsequent modification order.<span>  </span>On\r\nthe issue of conservatorship, Father and Mother were again appointed possessory\r\nconservators of M.H., while Grandmother and Aunt were appointed joint managing\r\nconservators of M.H. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>On\r\nthe issues of child support and attorney’s fees, the parties proceeded to a\r\nbench trial.<span>  </span>Father testified that he\r\nwas employed as a contractor and that his monthly net income was\r\n$2,633.00.<span>  </span>He also testified that he had\r\nreceived a personal injury settlement for injuries sustained in a pipeline\r\nexplosion, totaling approximately $900,000.<span> \r\n</span>Father stated that he had used the settlement proceeds to purchase a\r\nhome for himself and his parents, an automobile, and a boat.<span>  </span>He also stated that he had used the funds to\r\nestablish a college fund for M.H. in the amount of $20,700.00 and to pay back\r\nchild support in an amount of $26,000.00.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>The\r\ntrial court ordered Father to pay to appellees monthly child support in the\r\namount of $1,200.00, to pay Mother’s attorney’s fees in the amount of $7,000, and\r\nto pay Aunt’s attorney’s fees in the amount of $72,433.07. <span> </span>The trial court also
