The court\ngenerally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order\nand judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\n\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of\n\nthis appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is\n\ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\n       Plaintiff, a prisoner incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary, filed\n\nthis pro se action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging a myriad of violations of\n\nvarious constitutional rights. The district court adopted the magistrate judge’s\n\nreport and recommendation and dismissed plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Because the legal sufficiency of a complaint is\n\na question of law, we review the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal      de novo . See Sutton v.\n\nUtah State Sch. for the Deaf & Blind     , 173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n       Rule 12(b)(6) permits a court to dismiss a complaint when it fails to state\n\na claim upon which relief can be granted. “The complaint should not be\n\ndismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the\n\nplaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him\n\nto relief.” Hall v. Bellmon , 935 F.2d 1106, 1109 (10th Cir. 1991). In reviewing\n\nthe sufficiency of the complaint, we must presume the truthfulness of plaintiff’s\n\nfactual allegations and construe them in the light most favorable to him.     See id.\n\nIn addition, because plaintiff appears    pro se , we must construe his pleadings\n\nliberally, holding him “to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fby lawyers.” Id. at 1110. Guided by these standards, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal in part and reverse and remand in part.   1\n\n\n\n\n                                    Excessive Force\n\n       Plaintiff claims that defendants violated his Eighth Amendment rights by\n\nusing excessive force against him when he refused to submit to a haircut in\n\naccordance with prison policy. When plaintiff was brought to the penitentiary,\n\nofficials informed him that, pursuant to prison policy, they were going to cut his\n\nhair. Plaintiff objected, stating that he was an ordained minister in the “Church\n\nof Christ Salvation Ministries” and that his naturalist religion prohibited him from\n\ncutting his hair. Prison officials transferred plaintiff to the infirmary, where he\n\nwas locked in a cell while officials conferred. Shortly thereafter, Officer Painter\n\napproached plaintiff’s cell, and plaintiff reiterated his religious objections to the\n\nhaircut. At that point several other officers, outfitted in body armor and carrying\n\nshields and other extraction gear, approached plaintiff’s cell door. Upon seeing\n\n\n\n1\n       We address the issues plaintiff raised in his brief on appeal. To the extent\nplaintiff raised issues in his complaint before the district court but did not argue\nthem on appeal, he has waived those issues.      See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v.\nMhoon , 31 F.3d 979, 984 n.7 (10th Cir. 1994). Specifically, plaintiff devoted a\nsubstantial portion of his complaint to specific grievances he filed and the prison\nofficials’ treatment of those grievances. He does not pursue those complaints in\nhis brief on appeal and, therefore, we do not address them. We note, however,\nthat the district court found he failed to state a claim in regard to those issues and,\nwere we to address the issue, we would agree.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fthe armored officers, plaintiff feared for his safety and agreed, under duress, to\n\nproceed to the induction room for a haircut. In response, Officer Painter\n\ninstructed plaintiff to back up to the cell door, kneel down, and stick his ponytail\n\nthrough the opening in the door. When plaintiff told Officer Painter that he could\n\nnot bend down because of a knee injury and that he would go to the induction\n\nroom for a haircut, Officer Painter ordered plaintiff to get away from the door.\n\nThe armored officers then entered plaintiff’s cell, and plaintiff pushed one of the\n\nofficers’ shields aside because the bolts protruding from the shield were pointing\n\nat plaintiff’s eyes.\n\n       The remaining armored officers entered the cell, tackled plaintiff, and\n\nknocked him onto his back. Plaintiff rolled into a ball in an attempt to protect\n\nhimself from harm. One of the officers cuffed plaintiff’s right hand, and they\n\nrolled plaintiff onto his stomach while pulling on the cuffed wrist. At that point,\n\nplaintiff’s right arm was pinned underneath him and pulled across his chest to his\n\nleft shoulder. Two officers pinned down plaintiff’s legs and one pinned his right\n\nside. Plaintiff alleged that Officer Holloway placed his feet against plaintiff’s\n\nleft hip and shoulder and deliberately and maliciously exerted full strength in\n\npulling on the empty handcuff with the effect of pulling plaintiff’s right hand past\n\nhis left\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fshoulder, causing extreme pain. Plaintiff further alleged that\n\n       [a]t least one other Officer was maliciously, sadistically, wilfully and\n       wantonly kicking [him] in the tail-bone, and groin area, and another\n       was repeatedly kicking [him] in the left hip and kidney area, at which\n       time Sgt. Halter[] in a deliberate, intentional, violent, malicious,\n       sadistic and barbaric manner, without regard for human life and with\n       the intent to cause bodily harm, did a waist-high knee-drop directly\n       landing at the center of the back of [plaintiff’s] neck, which due to\n       his being pinned cause a twisting of [plaintiff’s] complete spine\n       resulting in severe and immediate pain.\n\nR. Vol. 1, tab 1 at 9. Plaintiff stated that “[t]hese actions were not necessary for\n\nany restraint but were rather accomplished by . . . defendants for the specific\n\npurpose of causing pain and injury to [plaintiff].”    Id. at 9-10.\n\n       The officers then dragged plaintiff out of the cell, chained him into\n\na wheelchair, and transported him to the induction room where they cut his hair.\n\nAfter the haircut, plaintiff was wheeled to the maximum security segregation\n\nblock, where he was unchained and thrown into a cell. Plaintiff alleged he was\n\n“then yanked to his knees and Officer Halter slammed his head into the cell wall,\n\nwhile he was ordered to strip.”    Id. at 10-11. Finally, plaintiff alleged that\n\n       [w]hile attempting to comply with the order to strip [plaintiff’s]\n       forehead was maliciously slammed into the wall twice more . . .,\n       without any legitimate justification, but rather these three assaults\n       were accomplished by these defendants for the specific purpose of\n       causing pain and injury to [plaintiff] and have resulted in permanent\n       scarring of his forehead.\n\nId. at 11. In addition to detailing these allegations in the factual summary portion\n\nof his complaint, plaintiff summarizes the incidents in the portion of his\n\n                                             -6-\n\fcomplaint labeled “Claims For Relief” and alleges that the physical force used\n\nby prison officials was deliberate, sadistic, and for the purpose of causing injury.\n\nId. at 36, paragraphs (b)-(g).\n\n       “The use of excessive force by jail officials violates a prisoner’s rights\n\nunder the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause when the\n\nprisoner is subjected to an ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.’”          Miller v.\n\nGlanz , 948 F.2d 1562, 1566 (10th Cir. 1991) (quoting          Whitley v. Albers , 475 U.S.\n\n312, 319 (1986)). In “non-emergency situations or when the State’s responsibility\n\nto the prisoner does not clash with other equally important governmental\n\nresponsibilities, . . . deliberate indifference is the appropriate Eighth Amendment\n\nstandard.” Id. at 1566-67 (quotations and citations omitted). In the case of\n\na prison disturbance or emergency situation, however, the question is “whether\n\nforce was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or\n\nmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm.”          Hudson v. McMillian , 503 U.S. 1, 7\n\n(1992) (adopting inquiry set out in     Whitley ). In finding that plaintiff failed to\n\nstate a claim, the district court applied the     Whitley test to all of plaintiff’s\n\nallegations of excessive force. We agree that the         Whitley inquiry governs at least\n\nthe analysis of plaintiff’s claim of excessive force that occurred in the infirmary\n\ncell. We are unable to determine from the complaint, however, what standard\n\nshould govern the claim that officials used excessive force once plaintiff was in\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fthe segregation block cell after having his hair cut.     See Miller , 948 F.2d at 1567\n\n(stating that the court was unable to determine from the complaint whether\n\nprisoner continued to pose a legitimate threat to the officers and other prisoners\n\nat the time prisoner alleged a second incident of excessive force and, therefore,\n\nthe court was unable to determine whether to apply the        Whitley standard or the\n\ndeliberate indifference standard).\n\n       That does not deter our holding at this stage, however, because plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint, taken as true, sufficiently states a claim under either standard.   2\n\n\n\nPlaintiff’s detailed allegations of force applied maliciously and sadistically by the\n\nvarious prison officials for the purpose of causing harm are sufficient to state\n\na claim under even the heightened        Whitley standard. See id. , 948 F.2d at 1567\n\n(holding that specific allegations of force similar to those plaintiff alleges here\n\nwere sufficient to state a claim under     Whitley standard). On remand, it will be for\n\nthe district court to make a further determination as to which standard applies to\n\nthe claim of excessive force that occurred in the segregation block after plaintiff’s\n\nhair had been cut.   See id. Then, of course, the district court can conduct\n\nsummary judgment proceedings and enter the appropriate findings and order at\n\nthat stage.\n\n\n2\n      The complaint states a claim for excessive force only against those\ndefendants by whom plaintiff alleged personal involvement, namely defendants\nPainter, Holloway, Halter, Smith, and Martinez.\n\n                                              -8-\n\f                                    Religious Freedom\n\n       Plaintiff alleges that defendants violated his First Amendment right to\n\npractice his religion by cutting his hair. He stated in his complaint that he\n\nobjected to the haircut on religious grounds, he informed prison officials it was\n\nagainst his beliefs, and he was an ordained minister in the Church of Christ\n\nSalvation Ministries, a naturalist-based religion. These conclusory allegations\n\njustify the district court’s dismissal for failure to state a claim. “Plaintiff did not\n\naccompany his allegation with any details about his religious faith, nor did he\n\nallege what tenet of his faith required that he refuse the [haircut].”      Dunn v.\n\nWhite , 880 F.2d 1188, 1197 (10th Cir. 1989).       3\n                                                        Neither did he include those\n\n\n\n\n3\n        Plaintiff argues that the deficiencies in his complaint could be cured by\nallowing him to amend and that dismissal with prejudice was, therefore, improper.\nIt is true that dismissal without prejudice is the preferred route where a\n“plaintiff’s factual allegations are close to stating a claim but are missing some\nimportant element” and the district court dismisses claims     sua sponte .\nReynoldson v. Shillinger , 907 F.2d 124, 126 (10th Cir. 1990);     see also Hall ,\n935 F.2d at 1110. The same reasoning does not apply in a situation such as in this\ncase, however, where plaintiff had notice of his deficiencies by way of a motion\nto dismiss, plaintiff’s response to the motion did not cure the deficiencies,\nplaintiff did not cure the deficiency in his objections to the magistrate judge’s\nreport and recommendation, and he made no attempt to amend his complaint\nbefore the district court ruled on the motion to dismiss.    Cf. Hall , 935 F.2d\nat 1109-10 (stating that 12(b)(6) dismissal following a motion to dismiss gives\nplaintiff notice and opportunity to amend his complaint);     Neitzke v. Williams ,\n490 U.S. 319, 329-30 (1989) (same).\n\n                                              -9-\n\fnecessary details in his objections to the magistrate judge’s report and\n\nrecommendation.\n\n\n                                      Due Process\n\n       Plaintiff complains that defendants took certain property from him and that\n\nthe property deprivation violated his right to due process. If an adequate state\n\nremedy exists for the deprivation of the property, plaintiff cannot claim a due\n\nprocess violation.   See Hudson v. Palmer , 468 U.S. 517, 531-33 (1984). Plaintiff\n\nargued in his objections to the magistrate’s report and recommendation that he\n\nhas no adequate state postdeprivation remedy because the Wyoming\n\nGovernmental Claims Act grants immunity to public employees. Although\n\nthe district court did not identify the adequate state remedy in its finding that\n\nplaintiff failed to state a claim of a due process violation because an adequate\n\nstate remedy existed, we note that the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act waives\n\nimmunity in certain instances.    See Wyo. Stat. §§ 1-39-112, 1-39-103(a)(iii), and\n\n7-2-101(a)(iv)(H); see also Hudson , 468 U.S. at 536 n.15. In addition, the prison\n\ngrievance procedure, with which plaintiff is intimately familiar, provides an\n\nadequate state remedy.     See id. ; Cavender v. Uphoff , No. 96-8067, 1997 WL\n\n602418, at **1 (10th Cir. Sept. 26, 1997) (unpublished). The district court was\n\ncorrect in dismissing plaintiff’s claim of a due process violation resulting from\n\ndeprivation of property.\n\n                                          -10-\n\f                      Deliberate Indifference to Medical Needs\n\n       Plaintiff complains that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated by\n\ndefendants’ deliberate indifference to his medical needs. “A medical staff’s\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes a\n\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.”       Green v. Branson , 108 F.3d 1296, 1303\n\n(10th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted). The deliberate indifference standard has\n\ntwo components:\n\n       an objective component requiring that the pain or deprivation be\n       sufficiently serious; and a subjective component requiring that the\n       offending officials act with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.\n       With regard to the subjective component, allegations of inadvertent\n       failure to provide adequate medical care or of a negligent diagnosis\n       simply fail to establish the requisite culpable state of mind.\n\nMiller , 948 F.2d at 1569 (citations and quotations omitted). We agree with the\n\ndistrict court that some of plaintiff’s complaints can be read as allegations that\n\nthe medical provider was negligent in his or her diagnosis or choice of therapy,\n\nand that those complaints are not actionable.     See Green , 108 F.3d at 1303.\n\nAs plaintiff states on appeal, however, not all his allegations of deliberate\n\nindifference can be characterized as claims of negligent diagnosis or choice of\n\ntherapy. In fact, most of his claims focus on the delay in diagnosis or treatment\n\nof his medical needs. Although we have held that “delay in providing medical\n\ncare may constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment,” the circumstances\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f“have frequently involved life-threatening situations and instances in which it is\n\napparent that delay would exacerbate the prisoner’s medical problems,” and\n\ninstances where “the delay results in a lifelong handicap or a permanent loss.”\n\nHunt v. Uphoff , 199 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 1999). Plaintiff’s complaint\n\nalleges specific facts from which we conclude that any delay in medical treatment\n\ndid not result in a violation of plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment rights.\n\n\n                                   Access to Courts\n\n      Plaintiff claims defendants violated his right to access to the courts by\n\ndenying him legal materials while he was in isolation. To state a claim for denial\n\nof a right of access, plaintiff must also establish injury resulting from the denial.\n\nSee Lewis v. Casey , 518 U.S. 343, 351-54 (1996). The magistrate judge found\n\nthat, other than stating he was denied legal materials in isolation, plaintiff did not\n\nindicate how he was injured by defendants’ denying him access to the legal\n\nmaterials. In his objections to the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation,\n\nhowever, plaintiff enumerated seven specific forms of injury that he alleged\n\nresulted from the denial of access to legal materials. R. Vol. I, tab 56 at 8. The\n\ndistrict court, in its order adopting the report and recommendation, made no\n\nmention of the denial of access claim and did not acknowledge the specific\n\nallegations of injury enumerated in plaintiff’s objections to the magistrate judge’s\n\nreport and recommendation. We express no opinion as to whether the injuries\n\n                                          -12-\n\falleged meet the standards of   Lewis , but we are unable to discern whether the\n\ndistrict court considered the specific allegations of injury and rejected them as\n\ninsufficient under Lewis , or whether it consciously chose not to consider the\n\nallegations in the objections to the magistrate’s report and recommendation for\n\nwhatever reason. On remand the district court should address this issue.\n\n\n                                          Threats\n\n      Plaintiff alleged that defendants threatened him against filing grievances\n\nand in connection with denying him access to the courts. The district court was\n\ncorrect that plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n\nTo the extent that plaintiff complains that threats by prison officials violated his\n\nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, because plaintiff has not\n\nalleged the threats instilled in him “terror of instant and unexpected death,”\n\nhe does not state a claim under § 1983.    Northington v. Jackson , 973 F.2d 1518,\n\n1524 (10th Cir. 1992) (citing   Collins v. Cundy , 603 F.2d 825, 827 (10th Cir.\n\n1979)).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\f                               Conditions of Confinement\n\n       Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that the conditions of his confinement\n\nin segregation violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel\n\nand unusual punishment. He alleged that he was housed in segregation for\n\ntwenty-four days and was denied toilet paper for the first four days. He alleged\n\nthat he was forced to lay on the cold concrete floor eighteen hours a day and was\n\ngiven a feces-smeared mattress with holes in it and half of a blanket for the\n\nremaining six hours a day. In addition, he claimed he was denied all personal\n\nhygiene items and that soap and shampoo were provided only every three days\n\nwhen he was allowed to shower. Finally, he alleged deprivation of socks, briefs,\n\ncorrective lenses, eye drops, dentures, toothbrush, and toothpaste.\n\n       The standard by which we measure whether conditions of confinement\n\nviolate a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment rights is deliberate indifference.\n\nSee Mitchell v. Maynard , 80 F.3d 1433, 1442 (10th Cir. 1996). Conditions of\n\nconfinement must be considered as a whole.         See id. A condition of confinement\n\nviolates a prisoner’s constitutional rights if it deprives him “of the minimal\n\ncivilized measure of life’s necessities.”   Id. (quotation omitted).\n\n       In his report and recommendation, the magistrate judge acknowledged only\n\nthe allegation that plaintiff was given a feces-smeared mattress. The magistrate\n\njudge found that plaintiff had not stated a claim that the segregation conditions\n\n                                            -14-\n\fviolated the Eighth Amendment because plaintiff did not allege that he brought\n\nthe condition of his mattress to the attention of prison officials.   See Farmer v.\n\nBrennan , 511 U.S. 825, 836 (1994) (holding that prison official can be found\n\nliable under the Eighth Amendment for denying inmate humane conditions of\n\nconfinement only if official knows of and disregards excessive risk to inmate\n\nsafety). However, plaintiff stated in his complaint that he had filed a grievance\n\nregarding the condition of his segregation confinement and that he had exhausted\n\nall his administrative remedies with respect to all his complaints. In addition, in\n\nhis objections to the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation, plaintiff\n\nstated that he did, in fact, complain about the mattress in his grievance regarding\n\nthe conditions of his segregated confinement. On remand, the district court\n\nshould revisit plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim and address all of the alleged\n\ndeprivations.   4\n\n\n\n\n4\n       We note that the magistrate judge did address the alleged loss of privileges\nwhile in segregation, and we agree that plaintiff did not state a claim for violation\nof due process rights in that regard. See Sandin v. Conner , 515 U.S. 472, 486\n(1995). The magistrate judge did not, however, with the exception of the\nfeces-smeared mattress allegation, acknowledge plaintiff’s other specific\nallegations surrounding his conditions of confinement claim, including the lack\nof toilet paper, personal hygiene items, and clothing.\n\n       Further, we note that, with regard to the alleged deprivation of those items,\nplaintiff asserts this conditions of confinement claim against only defendant\nHalter.\n\n                                             -15-\n\f                                      Conspiracy\n\n      We agree with the district court that plaintiff has failed to state a claim for\n\ncivil conspiracy under § 1983 because he did not “allege specific facts showing\n\nan agreement and concerted action amongst the defendants.”       Tonkovich v. Kansas\n\nBd. of Regents , 159 F.3d 504, 533 (10th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff merely alleged many\n\nunlawful acts by various defendants and stated, without any specific facts\n\nevidencing an agreement among the various defendants, that they conspired\n\nagainst him.\n\n\n                                  State Law Claims\n\n      The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\n\nplaintiff’s state law claims because it dismissed all plaintiff’s § 1983 claims.\n\nBecause we hold that plaintiff’s complaint states a federal claim under § 1983,\n\non remand the district court should revisit whether to exercise jurisdiction over\n\nthe pendant state law claims.   See Miller , 948 F.2d at 1568.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f                                     Conclusion\n\n      We AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal for failure to state a claim\n\nplaintiff’s allegations of: (1) violation of his First Amendment right to religious\n\nfreedom; (2) violation of his due process rights resulting from the deprivation\n\nof property and the conditions of his segregation confinement; (3) violation of\n\nhis Eighth Amendment rights as a result of deliberate indifference to his\n\nmedical needs; (4) violation of constitutional rights as a result of threats; and\n\n(5) conspiracy. We hold that plaintiff stated a claim for violation of his Eighth\n\nAmendment rights resulting from prison officials’ use of excessive force and that\n\nthe district court’s dismissal of this claim under Rule 12(b)(6) was premature.\n\nWe REVERSE the district court’s dismissal of plaintiff’s excessive force claim\n\nand REMAND for further proceedings. We also REVERSE the district court’s\n\nRule 12(b)(6) dismissal of plaintiff’s claims that defendants denied him access to\n\nthe courts and that they violated his Eighth Amendment rights as a result of the\n\nconditions of his segregation confinement. We also REMAND those claims for\n\nfurther consideration consistent with this order and judgment.\n\n\n                                                     Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                                     Stephen H.

In reviewing\n\nthe sufficiency of the complaint, we must presume the truthfulness of plaintiff’s\n\nfactual allegations and construe them in the light most favorable to him.     See id.\n\nIn addition, because plaintiff appears    pro se , we must construe his pleadings\n\nliberally, holding him “to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fby lawyers.” Id. at 1110. Guided by these standards, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal in part and reverse and remand in part.   1\n\n\n\n\n                                    Excessive Force\n\n       Plaintiff claims that defendants violated his Eighth Amendment rights by\n\nusing excessive force against him when he refused to submit to a haircut in\n\naccordance with prison policy. When plaintiff was brought to the penitentiary,\n\nofficials informed him that, pursuant to prison policy, they were going to cut his\n\nhair. Plaintiff objected, stating that he was an ordained minister in the “Church\n\nof Christ Salvation Ministries” and that his naturalist religion prohibited him from\n\ncutting his hair. Prison officials transferred plaintiff to the infirmary, where he\n\nwas locked in a cell while officials conferred. Shortly thereafter, Officer Painter\n\napproached plaintiff’s cell, and plaintiff reiterated his religious objections to the\n\nhaircut. At that point several other officers, outfitted in body armor and carrying\n\nshields and other extraction gear, approached plaintiff’s cell door. Upon seeing\n\n\n\n1\n       We address the issues plaintiff raised in his brief on appeal. To the extent\nplaintiff raised issues in his complaint before the district court but did not argue\nthem on appeal, he has waived those issues.      See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v.\nMhoon , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675840\"><a href=\"/opinion/675840/state-farm-fire-casualty-company-v-robert-ray-mhoon-takura-fujiwara/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984 n.7 (10th Cir. 1994). Specifically, plaintiff devoted a\nsubstantial portion of his complaint to specific grievances he filed and the prison\nofficials’ treatment of those grievances. He does not pursue those complaints in\nhis brief on appeal and, therefore, we do not address them. We note, however,\nthat the district court found he failed to state a claim in regard to those issues and,\nwere we to address the issue, we would agree.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fthe armored officers, plaintiff feared for his safety and agreed, under duress, to\n\nproceed to the induction room for a haircut. In response, Officer Painter\n\ninstructed plaintiff to back up to the cell door, kneel down, and stick his ponytail\n\nthrough the opening in the door. When plaintiff told Officer Painter that he could\n\nnot bend down because of a knee injury and that he would go to the induction\n\nroom for a haircut, Officer Painter ordered plaintiff to get away from the door.\n\nThe armored officers then entered plaintiff’s cell, and plaintiff pushed one of the\n\nofficers’ shields aside because the bolts protruding from the shield were pointing\n\nat plaintiff’s eyes.\n\n       The remaining armored officers entered the cell, tackled plaintiff, and\n\nknocked him onto his back. Plaintiff rolled into a ball in an attempt to protect\n\nhimself from harm. One of the officers cuffed plaintiff’s right hand, and they\n\nrolled plaintiff onto his stomach while pulling on the cuffed wrist. At that point,\n\nplaintiff’s right arm was pinned underneath him and pulled across his chest to his\n\nleft shoulder. Two officers pinned down plaintiff’s legs and one pinned his right\n\nside. Plaintiff alleged that Officer Holloway placed his feet against plaintiff’s\n\nleft hip and shoulder and deliberately and maliciously exerted full strength in\n\npulling on the empty handcuff with the effect of pulling plaintiff’s right hand past\n\nhis left\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fshoulder, causing extreme pain. Plaintiff further alleged that\n\n       [a]t least one other Officer was maliciously, sadistically, wilfully and\n       wantonly kicking [him] in the tail-bone, and groin area, and another\n       was repeatedly kicking [him] in the left hip and kidney area, at which\n       time Sgt. Halter[] in a deliberate, intentional, violent, malicious,\n       sadistic and barbaric manner, without regard for human life and with\n       the intent to cause bodily harm, did a waist-high knee-drop directly\n       landing at the center of the back of [plaintiff’s] neck, which due to\n       his being pinned cause a twisting of [plaintiff’s] complete spine\n       resulting in severe and immediate pain.\n\nR. Vol. 1, tab 1 at 9. Plaintiff stated that “[t]hese actions were not necessary for\n\nany restraint but were rather accomplished by . . . defendants for the specific\n\npurpose of causing pain and injury to [plaintiff].”    Id. at 9-10.\n\n       The officers then dragged plaintiff out of the cell, chained him into\n\na wheelchair, and transported him to the induction room where they cut his hair.\n\nAfter the haircut, plaintiff was wheeled to the maximum security segregation\n\nblock, where he was unchained and thrown into a cell. Plaintiff alleged he was\n\n“then yanked to his knees and Officer Halter slammed his head into the cell wall,\n\nwhile he was ordered to strip.”    Id. at 10-11. Finally, plaintiff alleged that\n\n       [w]hile attempting to comply with the order to strip [plaintiff’s]\n       forehead was maliciously slammed into the wall twice more . . .,\n       without any legitimate justification, but rather these three assaults\n       were accomplished by these defendants for the specific purpose of\n       causing pain and injury to [plaintiff] and have resulted in permanent\n       scarring of his forehead.\n\nId. at 11. In addition to detailing these allegations in the factual summary portion\n\nof his complaint, plaintiff summarizes the incidents in the portion of his\n\n                                             -6-\n\fcomplaint labeled “Claims For Relief” and alleges that the physical force used\n\nby prison officials was deliberate, sadistic, and for the purpose of causing injury.\n\nId. at 36, paragraphs (b)-(g).\n\n       “The use of excessive force by jail officials violates a prisoner’s rights\n\nunder the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause when the\n\nprisoner is subjected to an ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.’”          Miller v.\n\nGlanz , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572159\"><a href=\"/opinion/572159/marcus-r-miller-v-stanley-glanz-sheriff-bob-bates-deputy-sheriff-dan/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1566 (10th Cir. 1991) (quoting          Whitley v.

In finding that plaintiff failed to\n\nstate a claim, the district court applied the     Whitley test to all of plaintiff’s\n\nallegations of excessive force. We agree that the         Whitley inquiry governs at least\n\nthe analysis of plaintiff’s claim of excessive force that occurred in the infirmary\n\ncell. We are unable to determine from the complaint, however, what standard\n\nshould govern the claim that officials used excessive force once plaintiff was in\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fthe segregation block cell after having his hair cut.

See id. , 948 F.2d at 1567\n\n(holding that specific allegations of force similar to those plaintiff alleges here\n\nwere sufficient to state a claim under     Whitley standard). On remand, it will be for\n\nthe district court to make a further determination as to which standard applies to\n\nthe claim of excessive force that occurred in the segregation block after plaintiff’s\n\nhair had been cut.

Then, of course, the district court can conduct\n\nsummary judgment proceedings and enter the appropriate findings and order at\n\nthat stage.\n\n\n2\n      The complaint states a claim for excessive force only against those\ndefendants by whom plaintiff alleged personal involvement, namely defendants\nPainter, Holloway, Halter, Smith, and Martinez.\n\n                                              -8-\n\f                                    Religious Freedom\n\n       Plaintiff alleges that defendants violated his First Amendment right to\n\npractice his religion by cutting his hair.

Plaintiff\n\nargued in his objections to the magistrate’s report and recommendation that he\n\nhas no adequate state postdeprivation remedy because the Wyoming\n\nGovernmental Claims Act grants immunity to public employees. Although\n\nthe district court did not identify the adequate state remedy in its finding that\n\nplaintiff failed to state a claim of a due process violation because an adequate\n\nstate remedy existed, we note that the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act waives\n\nimmunity in certain instances.    See Wyo. Stat. §§ 1-39-112, 1-39-103(a)(iii), and\n\n7-2-101(a)(iv)(H); see also Hudson , 468 U.S. at 536 n.15. In addition, the prison\n\ngrievance procedure, with which plaintiff is intimately familiar, provides an\n\nadequate state remedy.     See id. ; Cavender v.

Sept. 26, 1997) (unpublished). The district court was\n\ncorrect in dismissing plaintiff’s claim of a due process violation resulting from\n\ndeprivation of property.\n\n                                          -10-\n\f                      Deliberate Indifference to Medical Needs\n\n       Plaintiff complains that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated by\n\ndefendants’ deliberate indifference to his medical needs. “A medical staff’s\n\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes a\n\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.”       Green v. Branson , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737513\"><a href=\"/opinion/737513/rickke-l-green-also-known-as-rickke-leon-green-v-charlie-branson/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1303\n\n(10th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted). The deliberate indifference standard has\n\ntwo components:\n\n       an objective component requiring that the pain or deprivation be\n       sufficiently serious; and a subjective component requiring that the\n       offending officials act with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.\n       With regard to the subjective component, allegations of inadvertent\n       failure to provide adequate medical care or of a negligent diagnosis\n       simply fail to establish the requisite culpable state of mind.\n\nMiller , 948 F.2d at 1569 (citations and quotations omitted). We agree with the\n\ndistrict court that some of plaintiff’s complaints can be read as allegations that\n\nthe medical provider was negligent in his or her diagnosis or choice of therapy,\n\nand that those complaints are not actionable.     See Green , 108 F.3d at 1303.\n\nAs plaintiff states on appeal, however, not all his allegations of deliberate\n\nindifference can be characterized as claims of negligent diagnosis or choice of\n\ntherapy. In fact, most of his claims focus on the delay in diagnosis or treatment\n\nof his medical needs. Although we have held that “delay in providing medical\n\ncare may constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment,” the circumstances\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f“have frequently involved life-threatening situations and instances in which it is\n\napparent that delay would exacerbate the prisoner’s medical problems,” and\n\ninstances where “the delay results in a lifelong handicap or a permanent loss.”\n\nHunt v.

Plaintiff’s complaint\n\nalleges specific facts from which we conclude that any delay in medical treatment\n\ndid not result in a violation of plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment rights.\n\n\n                                   Access to Courts\n\n      Plaintiff claims defendants violated his right to access to the courts by\n\ndenying him legal materials while he was in isolation. To state a claim for denial\n\nof a right of access, plaintiff must also establish injury resulting from the denial.\n\nSee Lewis v. Casey , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351-54 (1996). The magistrate judge found\n\nthat, other than stating he was denied legal materials in isolation, plaintiff did not\n\nindicate how he was injured by defendants’ denying him access to the legal\n\nmaterials. In his objections to the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation,\n\nhowever, plaintiff enumerated seven specific forms of injury that he alleged\n\nresulted from the denial of access to legal materials. R. Vol. I, tab 56 at 8. The\n\ndistrict court, in its order adopting the report and recommendation, made no\n\nmention of the denial of access claim and did not acknowledge the specific\n\nallegations of injury enumerated in plaintiff’s objections to the magistrate judge’s\n\nreport and recommendation. We express no opinion as to whether the injuries\n\n                                          -12-\n\falleged meet the standards of   Lewis , but we are unable to discern whether the\n\ndistrict court considered the specific allegations of injury and rejected them as\n\ninsufficient under Lewis , or whether it consciously chose not to consider the\n\nallegations in the objections to the magistrate’s report and recommendation for\n\nwhatever reason. On remand the district court should address this issue.\n\n\n                                          Threats\n\n      Plaintiff alleged that defendants threatened him against filing grievances\n\nand in connection with denying him access to the courts. The district court was\n\ncorrect that plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n\nTo the extent that plaintiff complains that threats by prison officials violated his\n\nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, because plaintiff has not\n\nalleged the threats instilled in him “terror of instant and unexpected death,”\n\nhe does not state a claim under § 1983.

He alleged that he was housed in segregation for\n\ntwenty-four days and was denied toilet paper for the first four days. He alleged\n\nthat he was forced to lay on the cold concrete floor eighteen hours a day and was\n\ngiven a feces-smeared mattress with holes in it and half of a blanket for the\n\nremaining six hours a day. In addition, he claimed he was denied all personal\n\nhygiene items and that soap and shampoo were provided only every three days\n\nwhen he was allowed to shower. Finally, he alleged deprivation of socks, briefs,\n\ncorrective lenses, eye drops, dentures, toothbrush, and toothpaste.\n\n       The standard by which we measure whether conditions of confinement\n\nviolate a prisoner’s Eighth Amendment rights is deliberate indifference.\n\nSee Mitchell v.

Conditions of\n\nconfinement must be considered as a whole.         See id. A condition of confinement\n\nviolates a prisoner’s constitutional rights if it deprives him “of the minimal\n\ncivilized measure of life’s necessities.”   Id. (quotation omitted).\n\n       In his report and recommendation, the magistrate judge acknowledged only\n\nthe allegation that plaintiff was given a feces-smeared mattress. The magistrate\n\njudge found that plaintiff had not stated a claim that the segregation conditions\n\n                                            -14-\n\fviolated the Eighth Amendment because plaintiff did not allege that he brought\n\nthe condition of his mattress to the attention of prison officials.

However, plaintiff stated in his complaint that he had filed a grievance\n\nregarding the condition of his segregation confinement and that he had exhausted\n\nall his administrative remedies with respect to all his complaints. In addition, in\n\nhis objections to the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation, plaintiff\n\nstated that he did, in fact, complain about the mattress in his grievance regarding\n\nthe conditions of his segregated confinement. On remand, the district court\n\nshould revisit plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim and address all of the alleged\n\ndeprivations.   4\n\n\n\n\n4\n       We note that the magistrate judge did address the alleged loss of privileges\nwhile in segregation, and we agree that plaintiff did not state a claim for violation\nof due process rights in that regard. See Sandin v.
