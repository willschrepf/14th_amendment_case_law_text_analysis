If such an\ninmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), he\nor she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.1 (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (f); People v. Yearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168.)\n          After the Act went into effect, Timothy James Rodriguez (defendant), an inmate\nserving a term of 25 years to life in prison following conviction of a felony that was not\nviolent (as defined by § 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)),\nfiled a petition for resentencing under the Act. The trial court found defendant was “not\ndisqualified from resentencing,” but declined to resentence him due to the risk of danger\nto public safety.\n          In the published portion of this opinion, we hold the court did not err by failing to\nappoint an expert on the issue of current dangerousness. In the unpublished portion, we\nconclude the trial court did not use the wrong legal standard, misallocate the burden of\nproof, or abuse its discretion by denying the petition. We also conclude recently enacted\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f). We\naffirm.\n                         FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY*\n          On February 22, 2000, defendant was stopped by a Madera law enforcement\nofficer because he was wearing clothing that matched the description of that worn by an\nattempted robbery suspect officers were trying to locate. Shortly after, defendant was\n\n1         Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n*         See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n\n                                                2.\n\ftaken into custody on unrelated charges. He was found to have five individually wrapped\nplastic bags of heroin in his belongings. While being booked into jail, he spontaneously\nstated he had been making a delivery. After being advised of and waiving his\nconstitutional rights, he explained he was a heroin user who purchased heroin in packages\nto sell to continue supporting his drug habit. On September 8, 2000, defendant pled\nguilty to possession of heroin for sale (Health & Saf. Code, § 11351) and admitted having\ntwo prior strike convictions. On November 9, 2000, he was sentenced to 25 years to life\nin prison.\n       On November 13, 2012, defendant filed a petition to recall his sentence and be\nresentenced pursuant to the Act. He represented he (1) was statutorily eligible for such\nrelief; (2) had a strike record consisting of a 1985 conviction for robbery (in which he\nhanded the clerk a note to complete the crime and which did not involve a weapon) and a\n1992 conviction for first degree burglary; (3) was 59 years old; (4) had not incurred any\ndisciplinary rule infractions since entering the custody of the California Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation in November 2000; (5) had availed himself of academic\nprograms and earned his GED in November 2005; (6) had been actively participating in\nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) since October 2006; and (7) had been actively participating\nin Victim Awareness Offender’s Program (VAOP) since February 2012.2 With respect\nto postrelease plans, defendant stated he had no definite plans for residency, but\nanticipated transitional housing acceptance letters from various programs throughout\nCalifornia. If none were forthcoming, he expected to reside at the Madera Rescue\nMission until he could arrange to relocate to Fresno, where he intended to enroll in a\ntruck driving school. Defendant conceded his criminal history was extensive, but noted\n\n\n\n2     Defendant submitted numerous favorable “chronos” and other documents in\nsupport of his claims.\n\n\n\n                                             3.\n\fhis crimes were primarily property crimes and his criminal history was attributable to his\ndrug use, which he had now addressed.\n       The People opposed the petition. They implicitly conceded defendant was not\ndisqualified from resentencing under the Act, but argued he should not be resentenced\nbecause doing so would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The\nPeople pointed to defendant’s eight felony and 11 misdemeanor convictions dating back\nto 1972; the fact one of his strike priors was a robbery, which by its nature was violent;3\nthe length and number of his prior prison commitments and number of parole violations;\nthe fact that, although the strike offenses were from 1985 and 1992, defendant led a\ncontinuous life of crime before and after those convictions; and the uncertainty of\ndefendant’s parole plans. The People acknowledged defendant’s lack of prison\ndisciplinary record and the fact he had completed numerous vocational/job training,\nsubstance abuse, and academic classes, and agreed he had made commendable gains\nwhile in prison. They argued, however, that his “abysmal” criminal record and over 20\nyears of using drugs and stealing could not be overlooked; moreover, he had never\ndemonstrated an ability to be law abiding or employed. They asserted he was ill\nequipped to return to society, had no real parole plan, would be unable to support himself,\nand was likely to reoffend if released.\n       Defendant responded by writing a letter to the court in which he apologized for his\npast criminal conduct. He again pointed to his lack of in-prison disciplinary record and\nparticipation in self-help groups such as NA. He also detailed steps he intended to take to\nobtain housing and employment, should he be released. In his formal response, he\nargued he did not have a long or consistent history of violence, and pointed to his record\n\n\n\n3       Due to the age of the convictions, the People did not have any information about\nthe circumstances of the prior strike cases.\n\n\n\n                                             4.\n\fof rehabilitation. He asserted there were insufficient facts for the court to find he posed\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n       The petition was heard on August 2, 2013.4 The court invited defense counsel to\nbe heard first. When counsel said everything had been presented in the moving papers\nand he would prefer to respond to whatever the People said unless there was something\nthe court needed to have addressed, the court confirmed it was to consider the original\npetition and exhibits prepared by defendant before counsel was appointed, together with\nthe defense’s response and appended documents. Counsel then argued that although\ndefendant had a lengthy prior record, this was “somewhat natural” for a third strike\noffender, and defendant’s serious and/or violent crimes occurred some time ago. Counsel\nemphasized defendant had been a model prisoner with no disciplinary violations, and had\ndone many things toward rehabilitation. Counsel also noted defendant had been assessed\nby the prison itself as being a low risk to reoffend. Counsel argued defendant had done\neverything he could possibly do, and the People had not presented any evidence to show\nhe was a current risk of danger to the public safety.\n       Asked by the court whether “risk of danger to the public safety” was limited to\nphysical safety, as in violent crimes, or included safety from having other property crimes\nperpetrated against the public, defense counsel argued “dangerousness” and “risk” were\nkey. He analogized the situation to parole cases dealing with life prisoners, and noted\nthose cases involved murderers and so were concerned with whether those prisoners were\ngoing to commit such crimes again. Counsel argued risk of danger and public safety\nmeant more than committing petty theft or second degree burglary, and argued concern\nwith risk of commission of a violent crime would be in line with the Act’s amendments to\nthe three strikes law, because the third strike now had to be a serious or violent felony.\n\n4      The judge who imposed defendant’s third strike sentence was no longer on the\nbench, so the matter was heard by a different judge. (See § 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\f       The prosecutor acknowledged defendant had no disciplinary record while in prison\nand a good record of attendance in rehabilitation programs. He argued there was a\ndifference, however, between one’s behavior in a structured setting such as prison and\nhow one behaves outside of prison. He asserted defendant’s criminal history showed that\ndefendant had been sent to prison many times before, and each time he got out, he\ncommitted new crimes. The prosecutor argued the term “public safety” encompassed the\nsafety of one’s belongings, but in defendant’s case, there was additionally an escalation\nin how property was obtained. The prosecutor argued that between 1972, when\ndefendant was 19 years old, and 2000, defendant was in prison or in jail or violating some\nlaw. The prosecutor also argued defendant’s parole plans (or lack thereof) were relevant,\nand he expressed concern over releasing an individual who had committed crimes over\ndecades, just because he behaved in prison.\n       The court asked defense counsel to address the fact defendant seemed to have a\nproblem complying with the law when not in custody. Counsel responded that the three\nstrikes law was a criminal statute, and if everyone’s petition for resentencing was going\nto be denied because they committed serious and violent crimes, then resentencing should\nnot be included in the law. Thus, the standard was not denial based just on the prior\ncriminal record. Counsel acknowledged the prior record was a relevant factor, but argued\nthe court had to consider the totality of the picture. He emphasized defendant’s good\nbehavior during his time in custody, and argued it was easy to get “written up” for\nsomething in prison, yet defendant had no disciplinary chronos. Counsel argued\ndefendant’s prior record was not evidence defendant was currently a danger. As for\nparole plans, counsel stated he was familiar with Madera Rescue Mission and that, while\nthey would not conclusively accept defendant until he was out of custody and had\ninterviewed with them, defendant would be a suitable candidate for their program.\nCounsel pointed out defendant had also obtained information for workforce programs and\nother agencies, and that he had put time and effort into doing that on his own while still\n\n                                              6.\n\fin prison. The court then confirmed directly with defendant that enrollment in a specific\ntruck driving school was still something he wanted to pursue.\n      This ensued:\n\n             “[THE COURT:] I am directed by the terms of the Prop 36\n      modification to the Three Strikes Law to consider criminal history\n      including the types of crimes, the extent of injuries to the victims, the\n      length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of crimes, and I do\n      have those issues in mind. So I can’t just start with the time when he went\n      into custody and his conduct since then nor can I just limit it to the time\n      before he got into custody.\n\n             “Looking at his in custody time, I don’t think that, on the face of it, I\n      would be asking more of [defendant]. He … has behaved himself, he has\n      followed the rules as far as I can see. I don’t have any reason to believe\n      otherwise. He has done the program, he’s done the Narcotics Anonymous\n      program there, he obtained his GED certificate in 2005, he did go through\n      the Victim Awareness Offenders Program, the VAOP program.\n\n             “And then in the annual review …, it indicates that no serious\n      disciplinary action during his time there. So I think he has done well to the\n      extent that he could do well during his time in custody.\n\n             “He has a history, as I count them of eleven misdemeanors and the\n      eight felonies, and that includes juvenile actions as well. It appears to me\n      that … [defendant] has had difficulty in complying with the rules.\n\n             “[Defense counsel] has indicated that it’s not easy to comply with\n      the rules while in custody, and I understand that and appreciate that.\n\n             “[Defense counsel] also pointed out that in order to reintegrate into\n      society, it’s not easy to do that either. And it appears to me that [defendant]\n      has not been, by his own history here, successful in that regard. I don’t\n      have any appreciable periods of time when he’s been without a criminal\n      conviction.\n\n            “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, … I believe he was free of\n      custody from 1979 to 1984.\n\n             “THE COURT: Was he in custody during that period of time?\n\n             “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, he was out of custody.\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\f             “THE DEFENDANT: I was employed, your Honor. I have a Social\n      Security statement from 2006 which shows I was employed those years, in\n      1979 to early 1984.\n\n             “THE COURT: Okay. So approximately a 5-year period. All right.\n      Then, let me go back there just a moment. I want to look at the records on\n      that. All right. [¶] Any comment in that regard by the People? [¶] … [¶]\n\n             “[PROSECUTOR]: I’ll submit on that, your Honor. I don’t show\n      any record that he was in custody at that time. [¶] … [¶]\n\n             “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I’m sorry, your Honor, the last thing I\n      want to note. Before his last yearly review on his controlled substance, he\n      was classified as a low risk on that.\n\n             “THE COURT: All right. Thank you. And I think you mentioned\n      that .… [¶] And as mentioned by the People, we’ve seen an escalation\n      even without crime during that period 1979 to 1984, the fact that we have\n      the felony first degree burglary in 1992.\n\n              “So I’m not going to find that he does not present a danger to\n      reoffend or to present a danger to society or to safety of the public. I find\n      that there is a reasonable risk of danger if he would be released on that\n      basis.\n\n             “As noted by the People, there has been an escalation in the type of\n      crime .… [¶] … And looking at whether the circumstances of his\n      commitment offenses were considered, I have considered those. And his\n      offenses are of concern because it has escalated.\n\n              “If it was just a crime, not serious or violent, we wouldn’t be here in\n      the first place but he’s got a consistent series of crimes during the time he’s\n      out. The greatest period of which he was without crime was the one that\n      was just mentioned by the defense. So I’m not ordering that he be\n      resentenced.”\n      Defense counsel then sought clarification whether the court interpreted\n“unreasonable risk to the public safety” to mean a risk that defendant commit any crime,\nor serious or violent crimes. The court responded: “My interpretation is that to the\nextent that he’s committing any crime, it’s something that I consider to whether — to the\nissue whether he would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public safety.” When\ncounsel suggested the court was putting a great deal more weight on defendant’s prior\n\n                                            8.\n\frecord than on his in-custody record, the court stated: “Well, I don’t know how you want\nto quantify that, Counsel. I’m considering both his time in custody … and then his\nhistory in crimes committed .… So upon balance, it appears to me that it would be an\nunreasonable risk to the danger to the public safety for the resentencing.” When counsel\nasked whether the court was “not giving any weight to the prison’s evaluation — the\npeople that know [defendant] the best, that they consider him a low risk to reoffend,” the\ncourt responded it had considered that as well.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Defendant says he is entitled to a remand for reconsideration of his petition,\nbecause the sentencing court (1) applied the wrong legal standard; (2) misallocated the\nburden of proof; (3) abused its discretion in considering the evidence, because it engaged\nin unfounded speculation without obtaining an expert evaluation; and (4) abused its\ndiscretion by denying relief based solely on defendant’s remote history of recidivism. In\nconjunction with the last claim, defendant says the court’s ruling is not supported by\nsufficient evidence, because his remote recidivist behavior did not preponderate over the\nextensive evidence of his more recent exemplary behavior and accomplishments. We\ndisagree that remand is required.\n                                              I*\n                                     STANDARD OF PROOF\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.5 (People v. Superior Court (Martinez) (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 979,\n\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n5      “An inmate is eligible for resentencing if: [¶] (1) The inmate is serving an\nindeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c)\n\n\n                                              9.\n\f989.) If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (g).)\n       The plain language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an\nexercise of the sentencing court’s discretion. “‘Discretion is the power to make the\ndecision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367,\n375.) “Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its\nexercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the\ncourt exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that\nresulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nRodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125; see People v. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th\n148, 162 [abuse-of-discretion review asks whether ruling in question falls outside bounds\nof reason under applicable law and relevant facts].)\n\n\nof Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7. [¶] (2) The inmate’s current\nsentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii),\ninclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or\nclauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12. [¶] (3) The inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses\nappearing in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of\nSection 667 or clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (e).)\n\n\n\n                                              10.\n\f              “In reviewing for abuse of discretion, we are guided by two\n       fundamental precepts. First, ‘“[t]he burden is on the party attacking the\n       sentence to clearly show that the sentencing decision was irrational or\n       arbitrary. [Citation.] In the absence of such a showing, the trial court is\n       presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its\n       discretionary determination … will not be set aside on review.”’ [Citation.]\n       Second, a ‘“decision will not be reversed merely because reasonable people\n       might disagree. ‘An appellate tribunal is neither authorized nor warranted\n       in substituting its judgment for the judgment of the trial judge.’”’\n       [Citation.] Taken together, these precepts establish that a trial court does\n       not abuse its discretion unless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that\n       no reasonable person could agree with it.” (People v. Carmony, supra, 33\n       Cal.4th at pp. 376-377.)\n       “Because ‘all discretionary authority is contextual’ [citation], we cannot determine\nwhether a trial court has acted irrationally or arbitrarily … without considering the legal\nprinciples and policies that should have guided the court’s actions.” (People v. Carmony,\nsupra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 377.) “An abuse of discretion is shown when the trial court\napplies the wrong legal standard. [Citation.]” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior\nCourt (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733.)\n       Defendant suggests that because a trial court’s determination whether to\nresentence an eligible inmate under the Act is akin to the determination whether a\nprisoner serving a life term should be released on parole, “perhaps de novo review is\nappropriate.” In such parole cases, the governing statutes and regulations give parole\napplicants “an expectation that they will be granted parole unless the [parole authority]\nfinds, in the exercise of its discretion, that they are unsuitable for parole in light of the\ncircumstances specified by statute and by regulation.’ [Citation.]” (In re Shaputis (2008)\n44 Cal.4th 1241, 1258.) Article V, section 8, subdivision (b) of the California\nConstitution gives the Governor the power to review the parole authority’s decision.\n“Although ‘the Governor’s decision must be based upon the same factors that restrict the\n[parole authority] in rendering its parole decision’ [citation], the Governor undertakes an\nindependent, de novo review of the inmate’s suitability for parole. [Citation.]”\n\n\n\n                                               11.\n\f(Shaputis, supra, at p. 1258.) Appellate review is then limited to “the highly deferential\n‘some evidence’ standard .…” (In re Lawrence (2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181, 1190.)\n“[B]ecause the core statutory determination entrusted to the [parole authority] and the\nGovernor is whether the inmate poses a current threat to public safety, the standard of\nreview properly is characterized as whether ‘some evidence’ supports the conclusion that\nthe inmate is unsuitable for parole because he or she currently is dangerous.” (Id. at\np. 1191.)\n       Defendant fails to convince us a decision whether to resentence under the Act is\nsufficiently similar to a decision by the parole authority so as to mandate our independent\nreview as if we were in a position similar to the Governor. The California Constitution\ngives the state’s executive specific powers of review over parole decisions. (Cal. Const.,\nart. V, § 8, subd. (b).) At the time that constitutional provision was adopted, courts\napplied the “some evidence” test directly to the decisions of the parole authority. (In re\nRosenkrantz (2002) 29 Cal.4th 616, 626.) In light of the “fundamental[] differen[ce]”\nbetween the Governor’s power and that of the parole authority (In re Masoner (2009) 172\nCal.App.4th 1098, 1106, disapproved on another ground in In re Prather (2010) 50\nCal.4th 238, 252-253), even if we viewed a resentencing decision under the Act as being\nsimilar to the parole authority’s determination whether to grant parole, we would not\nview the role of an appellate court as similar to that of the Governor.\n       Anticipating we might so conclude, defendant points to the holding of Division\nThree of the Second District Court of Appeal, that where a court’s discretion under\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f) is concerned, the People bear the burden of proving\n“dangerousness” by a preponderance of the evidence. (People v. Superior Court\n(Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1301-1305 & fn. 25 (Kaulick); see Evid. Code,\n§ 115.) That court determined this is so — and Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S.\n466 (Apprendi) and its progeny do not apply — because “dangerousness is not a factor\nwhich enhances the sentence imposed when a defendant is resentenced under the Act;\n\n                                            12.\n\finstead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to be\nresentenced at all.” (Kaulick, supra, at p. 1303.)\n       Based on the foregoing, defendant appears to reason that because the People bear\nthe burden of proving “dangerousness” by a preponderance of the evidence, we must\nemploy the substantial evidence standard in reviewing a trial court’s denial of a\nresentencing petition. The Attorney General disagrees and argues that under the clear\nlanguage of section 1170.126, we review for abuse of discretion. The Attorney General\nconcludes: “[T]he trial court has discretion to determine an inmate’s risk of danger to\npublic safety based on evidence the court deems relevant. And just like other sentencing\ndecisions, the trial court’s exercise of its discretion in the section 1170.126 context\nshould be supported by stated factors and reviewed for an abuse of discretion.”\n       We agree we review a trial court’s ultimate decision whether to resentence an\ninmate under the Act — its determination whether “resentencing the petitioner would\npose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) — for abuse\nof discretion. If there is no evidence in the record to support the decision, the decision\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion. (See In re Robert L. (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057,\n1066.) As the Attorney General’s reference to the trial court’s determination being based\non evidence and supported by stated factors shows, the questions arise which party must\nproduce such evidence, and to what degree of certainty, and what level of support —\nwhat standard of proof — is required for a trial court to rely on such evidence or factors?\n(See People v. Mower (2002) 28 Cal.4th 457, 476.)\n       We agree with Kaulick that the applicable standard is preponderance of the\nevidence.6 This does not, however, mean the trial court must apply that standard in\n\n6      We have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial determination\nwhether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act. (People v. Blakely (2014)\n225 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1058, 1060-1061; People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020,\n1033, 1039-1040.) Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\n\n\n                                             13.\n\fmaking its ultimate determination whether to resentence a petitioner, or we must review\nthat determination for substantial evidence.7 Nor does it mean evidence of\ndangerousness must preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be\ndenied. Instead, considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126,\nwe conclude it means the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, facts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made.8 Stated another\nway, evidence showing a petitioner poses a risk of danger to public safety must be proven\nby the People by a preponderance. The reasons a trial court finds resentencing would\npose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence showing dangerousness\nversus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s discretion. The ultimate\ndetermination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a\ndiscretionary one. While the determination must be supported by record evidence\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\n\n\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act and a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n7       The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard. (People v. Wong (2010) 186\nCal.App.4th 1433, 1444.) Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n8      We do not interpret the Attorney General’s argument as taking serious issue with\nthe notion that whatever burden exists is allocated to the prosecution. Courts and parties\nhave assumed the burden is on the People (e.g., People v. Flores (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th\n1070, 1075; Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1301, fn. 25), and such allocation is in\nharmony with the language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) that an eligible petitioner\n“shall be resentenced … unless” the court makes the required determination.\n\n\n\n                                            14.\n\fdanger by a preponderance of the evidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence\nstandards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.9 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to Cunningham\nv. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270 (Cunningham), “three terms of imprisonment [were]\nspecified by statute for most offenses. The trial court’s discretion in selecting among\n[those] options [was] limited by section 1170, subdivision (b), which direct[ed] that ‘the\ncourt shall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are circumstances in\naggravation or mitigation of the crime.’” (People v. Black (2007) 41 Cal.4th 799, 808,\nfn. omitted.) Trial courts had “broad discretion” to impose the lower or upper term\ninstead of the middle term of imprisonment (People v. Scott (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 349),\nand generally were required by the statutes and sentencing rules to state reasons for their\ndiscretionary sentencing choices (ibid.). Such reasons had to be “supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence in the record” and reasonably related to the particular\nsentencing determination. (Ibid.; see former Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.420(b).) Even\nafter the DSL was reformed and amended in response to Cunningham, so as to eliminate\njudicial factfinding in selection of the appropriate term when three possible prison terms\nare specified by statute, establishment of facts by a preponderance of the evidence\nremains necessary with respect to certain discretionary sentencing decisions. (See In re\nColey (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 557-558.)10\n\n9      The determination of the appropriate penalty in a capital case “‘is “essentially\nmoral and normative …, and therefore … there is no burden of proof or burden of\npersuasion. [Citation.]” [Citation.]’ [Citations.]” (People v. McKinzie (2012) 54\nCal.4th 1302, 1362.)\n10      After Cunningham concluded the DSL violated a defendant’s Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial (Cunningham, supra, 549 U.S. at p. 281), the Legislature amended\nsection 1170 so that now “(1) the middle term is no longer the presumptive term absent\n\n\n                                            15.\n\f       The Attorney General points to People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 850-\n851, in which the California Supreme Court stated that, in making its discretionary\nsentencing choices post-Cunningham, “the trial court need only ‘state [its] reasons’\n[citation]; it is not required to identify aggravating and mitigating factors, apply a\npreponderance of the evidence standard, or specify the ‘ultimate facts’ that ‘justify[] the\nterm selected.’ [Citations.] Rather, the court must ‘state in simple language the primary\nfactor or factors that support the exercise of discretion.’ [Citation.]” (Italics added.)\n       The trial court’s ultimate determination when considering a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 is analogous to an evaluation of the relative weight\nof mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Such an evaluation “is not equivalent to a\nfactual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It follows, then,\nthat the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in that it\nneed not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “‘more likely than not’”].)\n       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court may base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\n\n\naggravating or mitigating facts found by the trial judge; and (2) a trial judge has the\ndiscretion to impose an upper, middle or lower term based on reasons he or she states.”\n(People v. Wilson (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 988, 992.) Subdivision (b) of section 1170\nstates the court “shall select the term which, in the court’s discretion, best serves the\ninterests of justice.”\n\n\n\n                                              16.\n\fwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself. Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation. Kaulick\nstated, in part: “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly situated to\nhim, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life term to which he was\noriginally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him with an opportunity to be resentenced\nto a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the\nthird strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was originally\nsentenced. As such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\nhis favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and\nsuch factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Id.\nat p. 1303, italics added.) The court further stated: “[I]t is the general rule in California\nthat once a defendant is eligible for an increased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its\ndiscretion to impose that penalty, may rely on factors established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1305, italics added.)\n       To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its\nfinding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within\n“the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Giminez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72.) The facts or evidence upon which the court’s\nfinding of unreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial evidence.\nIf a factor (for example, that the petitioner recently committed a battery, is violent due to\nrepeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a preponderance of the\nevidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk. (See People v. Cluff\n(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998 [trial court abuses its discretion when factual findings\n\n                                               17.\n\fcritical to decision find no support in record]; cf. People v. Read (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d\n685, 689-691 [where trial court erroneously determined defendant was statutorily\nineligible for probation, reviewing court was required to determine whether trial court\ngave sufficient other reasons, supported by facts of case, for probation denial].)\n                                               II*\n                           ALLOCATION OF BURDEN OF PROOF\n       Based on the fact the trial court gave defense counsel the first and last\nopportunities to be heard and the way in which it phrased its ruling, defendant contends\nthe court “appears” to have incorrectly allocated the burden of proof to defendant, to\nprove he did not pose a risk of danger to public safety. This, defendant says, was an\nabuse of discretion.\n       “As a general rule, we presume that the trial court has properly followed\nestablished law. [Citations.] This presumption, however, does not apply ‘where the law\nin question was unclear or uncertain when the lower court acted.’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nDiaz (1992) 3 Cal.4th 495, 567.) Kaulick was decided slightly more than three months\nbefore the hearing on defendant’s petition. We presume the court was aware of that\ndecision. Moreover, the People’s opposition to the petition, which the court clearly had\nreceived, stated the burden of proof as preponderance of the evidence. In his response to\nthe People’s opposition, defendant argued there were “insufficient facts” to allow the\ncourt to find defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and argued\nthe interests of justice would be served by resentencing him based on his rehabilitation\nrecord and “the lack of evidence” he posed an unreasonable risk to public safety. At the\nhearing, defendant argued the People had not presented any evidence to show he was\ncurrently a risk of danger to public safety.\n\n\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n\n                                               18.\n\f       In light of the totality of its comments and the argument before it, we conclude the\ntrial court properly allocated the burden of proof to the People and determined, in an\nexercise of its discretion, that resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.11\n                                             III\n                       FAILURE TO OBTAIN EXPERT EVALUATION\n       Defendant says resentencing him as a second strike offender would have released\nhim on postrelease community supervision (PRCS). (See § 3451; People v. Tubbs (2014)\n230 Cal.App.4th 578, 585-586; People v. Espinoza (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 635, 637-\n638.) Thus, he argues, the court was confronted with a situation similar to the decision\nwhether to grant parole to a life prisoner (see § 3041); in that context, current\npsychological evaluations are generally most relevant to an assessment of current\ndangerousness (see In re Lawrence (2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181, 1223-1224), and the court\nhere erred by failing to enlist, sua sponte, the assistance of an expert. Defendant says the\ncourt abused its discretion by engaging in unfounded speculation concerning, and relying\non its own nonexpert estimation of, defendant’s psychological state with respect to\nwhether defendant was still prone to reoffending outside the custodial setting.\n       Defendant cites Evidence Code section 730 for the proposition an expert may be\nappointed by a court sua sponte for the purpose of obtaining an impartial expert\nopinion.12 (See Mercury Casualty Co. v. Superior Court (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1027,\n\n\n\n11    That the court gave defense counsel the first opportunity to be heard does not\nsuggest otherwise. As defense counsel implicitly acknowledged at the hearing, defendant\nwas the moving party.\n12     Evidence Code section 730 provides, in relevant part: “When it appears to the\ncourt, at any time before or during the trial of an action, that expert evidence is or may be\nrequired by the court …, the court on its own motion … may appoint one or more experts\nto investigate, to render a report as may be ordered by the court, and to testify as an\n\n\n                                             19.\n\f1032.) That statute “does not authorize the appointment of experts after trial in\nconnection with sentencing proceedings.” (People v. Stuckey (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th\n898, 905; id. at p. 913.) Regardless of whether a proceeding under section 1170.126 is\nlikened to a trial or is part of a sentencing proceeding, “a trial court has inherent power,\nindependent of statute, to exercise its discretion and control over all proceedings relating\nto the litigation before it [citation],” including “the power to obtain evidence upon which\nthe judgment of the court may rest [citation].” (Johnson v. Banducci (1963) 212\nCal.App.2d 254, 260; see Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 967.)\nThus, it appears a court could appoint an expert, on its own motion, to conduct an\nevaluation concerning the risk of danger currently posed to public safety by an inmate\nseeking resentencing under the Act.\n       However, “[t]he decision on the need for the appointment of an expert lies within\nthe discretion of the trial court and the trial court’s decision will not be set aside absent an\nabuse of that discretion. [Citations.]” (People v. Gaglione (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1291,\n1304, disapproved on other grounds in People v. Martinez (1995) 11 Cal.4th 434, 452 &\nPeople v. Levesque (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 530, 539; accord, People v. Vatelli (1971) 15\nCal.App.3d 54, 61; see In re Eric A. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1394, fn. 4.) Whatever\nthe similarities between the decisions whether to resentence under the Act and to grant\nparole to an inmate serving a life term, appointment of an expert did not fall outside the\nbounds of reason in this case. The question before the court was whether resentencing\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Given the\ninformation already before the court — all of which the court considered — the court\nreasonably could make the required determination itself, without the input of an expert.\nAs has been stated in the context of a claim the word “unreasonable” is impermissibly\n\n\nexpert at the trial of the action relative to the fact or matter as to which the expert\nevidence is or may be required.”\n\n\n\n                                              20.\n\fvague, “Surely a superior court judge is capable of exercising discretion, justly applying\nthe public safety exception, and determining whether a lesser sentence would pose an\nunreasonable risk of harm to the public safety. [Citation.]” (People v. Flores, supra, 227\nCal.App.4th at p. 1075.)13\n                                            IV*\n                                     DENIAL OF PETITION\n       Next, defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion by denying the\npetition. He says the court denied relief based solely on defendant’s remote history of\nrecidivism and failed to apply the preponderance of the evidence standard, and the order\nis not supported by a preponderance of the evidence because the evidence of defendant’s\nremote recidivist behavior did not preponderate over the “significant and extensive”\nevidence of his exemplary current and recent behavior.\n       As we previously explained, the trial court was not required to apply the\npreponderance of the evidence standard, nor was evidence of risk of danger required to\npreponderate over evidence of rehabilitation in order for resentencing to be denied. The\nPeople met their burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts from which\nthe trial court reasonably could find resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable\n\n13      In re Lawrence, supra, 44 Cal.4th 1181, does not hold to the contrary. In that\ncase, the Governor reversed a parole grant in part based on negative language found in\nearly psychiatric evaluations of the inmate that suggested the inmate’s release would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to the public. (Id. at pp. 1190, 1223.) The California\nSupreme Court rejected the Governor’s conclusion, stating: “[T]he passage of time is\nhighly probative to the determination before us, and reliance upon outdated psychological\nreports — clearly contradicted by [the inmate’s] successful participation in years of\nintensive therapy, a long series of reports declaring [the inmate] to be free of\npsychological problems and no longer a threat to public safety, and [the inmate’s] own\ninsight into her participation in this crime — does not supply some evidence justifying\nthe Governor’s conclusion that [the inmate] continues to pose a threat to public safety.”\n(Id. at p. 1224.)\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n\n                                            21.\n\frisk of danger to public safety. The trial court gave due consideration to all the\ninformation before it, and so determined.14 Defendant’s record, including the fact he\nsuffered numerous convictions over a long period of time and into his late 40’s; his\nextensive number of parole violations for which he was returned to prison; and his\ninability to remain crime- or violation-free for any appreciable period of time;15\n\n14      The trial court correctly framed the pertinent issue as an inquiry into the risk of\nrecidivism in general, rather than the likelihood of future violence. Words and phrases\nused in the Penal Code “must be construed according to the context and the approved\nusage of the language .…” (§ 7, subd. 16.) In interpreting a ballot initiative, we afford\nthe words used their ordinary and usual meaning. (People v. Park (2013) 56 Cal.4th 782,\n796.) “[S]afety” has been variously defined as “the condition of being safe: freedom\nfrom exposure to danger: exemption from hurt, injury or loss” (Webster’s 3d New\nInternat. Dict. (1986) p. 1998) and “[t]he condition of being safe; freedom from danger,\nrisk, or injury” (American Heritage Dict. (2d college ed. 1982) p. 1084). That a crime (or\ncriminal) can constitute a danger to public safety without being violent is too obvious to\ndispute (see, e.g., People v. Hughes (2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 355; People v. Villalobos\n(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 310, 317) and is recognized both by the three strikes law’s\ninclusion as a strike, by reference to section 1192.7, subdivision (c)’s definition of a\n“serious felony,” any first degree burglary, furnishing certain drugs to a minor, and grand\ntheft involving a firearm (§§ 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1), 1192.7,\nsubd. (c)(18), (24) & (26)), and by section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2)’s disqualification\nfrom eligibility for resentencing persons convicted of certain narcotics offenses (see\n§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(i), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(i)). Although the ballot materials\nconcerning Proposition 36 focused on violent criminals, uncodified section 7 of the Act\nprovides: “This act is an exercise of the public power of the people of the State of\nCalifornia for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of\nCalifornia, and shall be liberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Italics\nomitted.) To condition resentencing denials upon the likelihood of future violence would\nrun contrary to the language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) and voters’ intent, and\nwould not effectuate the purposes of the Act.\n15     At the hearing, defendant represented, and the trial court accepted, that defendant\nremained free of custody from 1979 to 1984, during which time he was employed. The\nprobation officer’s report prepared in conjunction with the section 1170.126 hearing\nshowed, however, that defendant was convicted of three misdemeanors, for which he\nreceived some jail time, and an offense for which he received summary probation and\ncommunity service, during that period. Moreover, he committed the robbery that\nconstituted one of his strike priors in late 1984.\n\n\n\n                                             22.\n\freasonably supports the conclusion — even in light of a perfect prison behavior record —\nthat, although defendant thrives in prison, he does the opposite when released.16\nAccordingly, the trial court’s ruling fell within the bounds of reason.\n                                                V*\n                            SECTION 1170.18, SUBDIVISION (C)\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)17\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision at\n\n16    In light of defendant’s demonstrated inability to comply with the terms of parole\nsupervision, the fact he would be subject to mandatory PRCS upon release (see People v.\nTubbs, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th at pp. 585-586; People v. Espinoza, supra, 226\nCal.App.4th at pp. 637-638) does not alter our analysis or conclusion.\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n17    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n\n                                                23.\n\fissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\n\n\n\n\n                                            24.\n\fdefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.18\n       “‘In interpreting a voter initiative …, we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘“The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law.

Among the\nquestions we asked counsel to answer were whether defendant met the criteria for\nresentencing under section 1170.18 and, if so, whether we needed to determine the\napplicability, if any, of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to resentencing proceedings\nunder section 1170.126. We are satisfied it is appropriate for us to reach the issue of\napplicability regardless of whether defendant might obtain resentencing under\nProposition 47.\n\n\n\n                                            25.\n\finternally and with each other, to the extent possible.

On its face, “[a]s used throughout this Code,” as\nemployed in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), clearly and unambiguously refers to the\nPenal Code, not merely section 1170.18 or the other provisions contained in\nProposition 47. (See People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153, 164-165, 166; see\nalso Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1254-\n1255; People v. Vasquez (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 763, 766.)\n       This does not mean, however, that the definition contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) must inexorably be read into section 1170.126, subdivision (f). (Cf.\nMarshall v.

Mohammed (2008) 162\nCal.App.4th 920, 927.) “[I]t is settled that the language of a statute should not be given a\nliteral meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the [voters] did not\nintend” (In re Michele D. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 600, 606), or would “frustrate[] the manifest\npurposes of the legislation as a whole .…” (People v. Williams (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th\n1389, 1393.) “To this extent, therefore, intent prevails over the letter of the law and the\nletter will be read in accordance with the spirit of the enactment. [Citation.]” (In re\nMichele D., supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 606; accord, People v. Ledesma (1997) 16 Cal.4th 90,\n95.)\n\n\n\n                                             26.\n\f       Thus, “‘we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be\nachieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,\ncontemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the\nstatute is a part. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] We also ‘“refer to other indicia of the voters’\nintent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1034.) We\nconsider “the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation” (Dyna-Med,\nInc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1387), as well as “the\nwider historical circumstances” of the statute’s or statutes’ enactment (ibid.). “‘Using\nthese extrinsic aids, we “select the construction that comports most closely with the\napparent intent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather than defeating the\ngeneral purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd\nconsequences.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1034-1035.)\n       Proposition 47 and the Act address related, but not identical, subjects. As we\nexplain, reading them together, and considering section 1170.18, subdivision (c) in the\ncontext of the statutory framework as a whole (see People v. Acosta, supra, 29 Cal.4th at\np. 112; Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 658-659; In re\nCindy B. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 771, 781), we conclude its literal meaning does not\ncomport with the purpose of the Act, and applying it to resentencing proceedings under\nthe Act would frustrate, rather than promote, that purpose and the intent of the electorate\nin enacting both initiative measures (see People v. Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n\n\n                                             27.\n\f       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 823-\n       824.)19\n       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when … a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)\n\n19      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’” (See Historical\nand Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                            28.\n\f       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, as we previously observed, uncodified section 7 of the Act\nprovides: “This act is an exercise of the public power of the people of the State of\nCalifornia for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of\nCalifornia, and shall be liberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110,\noriginal italics omitted, italics added.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at page 1036, “Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\n\n                                             29.\n\fpeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\nstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\n\n                                              30.\n\funreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\nanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n\n\n\n                                            31.\n\f(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\nwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\nProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n2014) Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-\nproposition47-20141106-story.html> [as of Feb. 5, 2015].) Looking at the information\nconveyed to voters, however, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is\nof no import. (Cf. People v. Garcia (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1175-1176, fn. 5; People v.\nBradley (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 64, 83; Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. v.\nPerformance Plastering, Inc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 26, 30.)\n       We are also mindful “it has long been settled that ‘[t]he enacting body is deemed\nto be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\nenacted’ [citation], ‘and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof’ [citation].\n\n                                             32.\n\f‘This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative.

Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition. (People v. Garcia (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 763,\n769-770; People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075.) Because nowhere in the\nballot materials for Proposition 47 was it called to voters’ attention the definition of the\nphrase contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) would apply to resentencing\nproceedings under the Act, we simply cannot conclude voters intended Proposition 47 to\nalter the Act in that respect. Voters are not asked or presumed to be able to discern all\npotential effects of a proposed initiative measure; this is why they are provided with voter\ninformation guides containing not only the actual text of such a measure, but also a\nneutral explanation and analysis by the Legislative Analyst and arguments in support of\nand in opposition to the measure. As we have already observed, none of those materials\nso much as hinted that Proposition 47 could have the slightest effect on resentencing\nunder the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of enactment included information bill would add\ndefinition of particular term to Public Contract Code].)20\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\n\n20     For the same reasons, we reject any suggestion the definition contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) was intended to clarify the true meaning of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). (Cf. Re-Open Rambla, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1995) 39\nCal.App.4th 1499, 1511; In re Connie M. (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1225, 1238.)\n\n\n\n                                             33.\n\fmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that when\nstatutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings. [Citations.]” (People v. Caudillo (1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 585, overruled on\nanother ground in People v. Martinez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 229, 237, fn. 6 &\ndisapproved on another ground in People v. Escobar (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 749-751 &\nfn. 5; see Robbins v. Omnibus R. Co. (1867) 32 Cal. 472, 474.) We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\nsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the\ntwo measures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and\noffenders. In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391).\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\n\n                                            34.\n\fwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v. Foley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 794, 813) —\nconstraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are released\nmanifestly does not, nor does it comport with voters’ intent in enacting either measure.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand so the trial court can redetermine\ndefendant’s entitlement to resentencing under the Act utilizing the definition of\n“‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c).21\n\n\n\n\n21      Recently, the Third District Court of Appeal held section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c)’s definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” does not\napply retroactively to defendants whose petitions for resentencing under the Act were\ndecided before the effective date of Proposition 47. (People v. Chaney (2014) 231\nCal.App.4th 1391, 1395-1396, petn. for review pending, petn. filed Jan. 8, 2015.)\nChaney did not decide whether Proposition 47’s definition applies prospectively to such\npetitions. (Chaney, supra, at p. 1397, fn. 3.) Were we to conclude section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126, subdivision (f), we would agree with Chaney\nthat it does not do so retroactively. We believe, however, that a finding of\nnonretroactivity inexorably leads to the possibility of prospective-only application, and\nthat prospective-only application of Proposition 47’s definition to resentencing petitions\nunder the Act would raise serious, perhaps insurmountable, equal protection issues.\n“Mindful of the serious constitutional questions that might arise were we to accept a\nliteral construction of the statutory language, and of our obligation wherever possible\nboth to carry out the intent of the electorate and to construe statutes so as to preserve their\nconstitutionality [citations]” (People v. Skinner (1985) 39 Cal.3d 765, 769), we rest our\nholding on the reasoning set out in our opinion, ante.\n\n\n\n                                             35.\n\f                                 DISPOSITION\n     The judgment is affirmed.\n                                               _____________________\n                                                         DETJEN, J.\nI CONCUR:\n\n\n_____________________\nLEVY, Acting P.J.\n\n\nI CONCUR IN PART III:\n\n_____________________\nPEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                     36.\n\fPEÑA, J.\n       I respectfully dissent from parts IV and V of the majority opinion. I agree the trial\ncourt could, but was not required to, appoint an expert to evaluate defendant Timothy\nJames Rodriguez on the question of his current dangerousness. I would remand the\nmatter for resentencing, however, because it appears the trial court abused its discretion\nin denying resentencing on grounds unsupported by the evidence. A remand would\npermit the trial court to consider any changed circumstances establishing unreasonable\nrisk of dangerousness since the original hearing date of August 2, 2013. This would\ninclude the recent clarification of the meaning of the phrase “unreasonable risk of\ndangerousness” by Proposition 47’s1 enactment of Penal Code section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) (§ 1170.18(c)).\nANALYSIS\n       On February 22, 2000, defendant was arrested with five bindles of heroin. He\npled guilty to the crime of possession of heroin for sale in September of 2000 and was\nsentenced to 25 years to life on November 9, 2000, based on prior “strike” convictions\nfor robbery in 1984 and a first degree burglary in 1992. (§§ 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12,\nsubds. (a)-(e).) Between the current charge and the 1992 burglary “strike,” he suffered a\nmisdemeanor drug conviction in 1994 and a misdemeanor resisting or delaying arrest in\nviolation of Penal Code section 148 in 1998. He filed his petition for resentencing on\nNovember 13, 2012, and his petition was heard on August 2, 2013, roughly 13 and one-\nhalf years since his heroin possession for sale offense. Since that time, defendant\nsuffered no new convictions, no disciplinary violations in prison, and no “write-ups,” not\none. Instead, defendant obtained his GED and was awarded certificates of completion for\nvarious courses of academic education. He worked in the prison as a porter and a\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014)).\n\fteacher’s aid and was recognized as “an outstanding worker.” He was a member in good\nstanding of the “Lifers Group,” he had outstanding attendance in the 12-step recovery\nprogram of Narcotics Anonymous beginning in 2005, and he completed phases 1 and 2 of\nthe Victim Awareness Offenders Program. He was 59 years old at the time of the\nhearing.\n       The prosecutor agreed defendant was a “model prisoner.” He argued against\nresentencing, however, based on defendant’s “history of petty theft,” which he called a\n“petty theft problem,” and his escalating history of crime, referring to his robbery in 1984\nand his residential burglary in 1992. He repeatedly emphasized this,2 concluding:\n\n       “So our concern isn’t so much how the defendant behaves in prison, our\n       concern is what has consistently happened when released from prison, and\n       not just a safety of property but when it escalates into these actual violent\n       serious crimes as it has in the past.”\n\n\n2“[PROSECUTOR]:   Addressing specifically, if it’s—what exactly the term ‘public safety’\nmeans. There is room, I think, to look at the safety of having your belongings, you know,\nkept secure. But more so, what we see here is an escalation in how property is obtained.\n“We’re just not dealing with a history of petty theft. I think we can see from the record\nwe have a petty theft problem. But then we see that some times it escalates—it’s\nescalated [into] counts of 211 in 1984 and to a 459 first degree in 1992. So it has\nescalated, these property crimes, into crimes in which we do have what’s considered\nviolent and serious felonies.\n“More so too, if you look at the—it extends his entire life from 1972, I believe when he\nwas 19 years old. And then in 1998, we still have a 148 PC, resisting an officer, until the\npresent offense in 2000, and there’s just—either the defendant seems to be in prison or in\njail or he seems to be violating some law. This is a great concern because I think there’s\na difference between cases where you have two strikes and no other record, and I’ve seen\nthose, and cases where you have two strikes and a dozen other offenses.\n“I think when looking at who’s a reasonable danger to society, you have to look and see\nare we dealing with a fundamental issue with the individual where he has shown that all\nmodes of rehabilitation when outside of prison have failed and they escalate. And in this\ncase, they have escalated in both occasions into robberies and then into first degree\nburglaries as well.”\n\n\n\n                                             2.\n\f       The evidence does not, however, support a finding of an escalation in defendant’s\ncommission of crime since his strike convictions. Instead, as noted above, since his 1992\nresidential burglary, defendant’s crimes have deescalated with defendant committing two\nmisdemeanors and a felony possession for sale of heroin in early 2000, resulting in his\nlife sentence.\n       Unfortunately, in denying resentencing, the court adopted the prosecutor’s\nunsupported reasoning of an escalating pattern of criminal conduct:\n\n              “THE COURT: [A]s mentioned by the People, we’ve seen an\n       escalation even without crime during that period 1979 to 1984, the fact that\n       we have the felony first degree burglary in 1992.\n\n               “So I’m not going to find that he does not present a danger to\n       reoffend or to present a danger to society or to safety of the public. I find\n       there is a reasonable risk of danger if he would be released on that basis.\n\n              “As noted by the People, there has been an escalation in the type of\n       crime, so that is my finding, based upon the information provided.\n\n             “I am aware of the Lawrence case and Shaputis. And I think\n       Shaputis was also cited by the People as well. And looking at whether the\n       circumstances of his commitment offenses were considered, I have\n       considered those. And his offenses are of concern because it has escalated.\n\n               “If it was just a crime, not serious or violent, we wouldn’t be here in\n       the first place but he’s got a consistent series of crimes during the time he’s\n       out. The greatest period of which he was without crime was the one that\n       was just mentioned by the defense. So I’m not ordering that he be\n       resentenced.”\n       Setting aside the fact the standard provided by the law requires a finding of\n“unreasonable risk of danger” not “reasonable risk of danger,” which might be attributed\nto the court simply misspeaking, the facts do not support the conclusion. It seems clear\nthe evidence does not support a finding of “an escalation in the type of crime,” which the\ncourt’s statements appeared to show was the critical finding it relied upon to deny\nresentencing. “A trial court abuses its discretion when the factual findings critical to its\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fdecision find no support in the evidence.” (People v. Cluff (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991,\n998.) Consequently, the trial court abused its discretion by denying resentencing on the\ngrounds of “an escalation of crimes.”\n       Defendant has not had “an escalation” of crimes since his last strike—the\nresidential burglary in 1992, which he committed before the three strikes law was\nenacted. Defendant has gone 21 years without an escalation in crime since his residential\nburglary conviction in 1992. Rather, the opposite is true—his crimes since 1992 (two\nmisdemeanors and felony drug possession for sale) signaled a retreat from violent or\nserious felonies. In fact, defendant had no crimes for the previous 13 and one-half years.\nAlthough in custody during that time, defendant has had no violations of any sort during\nthat period.\n       It is true defendant had a history of theft crimes and other violations up until 2000,\nwhen he received his “Three Strikes” sentence. However, this is only one of many\nfactors the trial court may consider in the exercise of its discretion to resentence under\nPenal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (g). More importantly, the trial court may not\nrely on factors unsupported by the evidence that are critical to its decision, as occurred\nhere. (People v. Cluff, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 998; In re Robert L.(1993) 21\nCal.App.4th 1057, 1068 [court’s apparent concern with the possibility grandparents\nmight obstruct reunification was wholly speculative and therefore an abuse of discretion\nbecause it lacked any reasonable basis in the record]; Stack v. Stack (1961) 189\nCal.App.2d 357, 368 [“It would seem obvious that, if there were no evidence to support\nthe decision, there would be an abuse of discretion”].) Therefore, the matter should be\nremanded for resentencing unless the record shows changed circumstances establishing\nunreasonable risk of dangerousness since the hearing date of August 2, 2013.\n       In addition, I would direct the trial court to apply the current definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger” in its resentencing hearing, as provided in section\n1170.18(c). I respectfully disagree with the majority’s analysis that section 1170.18(c)\n\n                                              4.\n\fhas no application to resentencing under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes Reform Act of\n2012 (the Act).\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, and went into effect the next day (Cal. Const., art II, § 10,\nsubd. (a).) Thus, it would apply to a new resentencing hearing under the Act.\n\n               “‘When construing a statute, we must “ascertain the intent of the\n       Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.”’ [Citations.] ‘[W]e\n       begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary\n       meaning.’ [Citation.] ‘If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,\n       then we need go no further.’ [Citation.] If, however, the language supports\n       more than one reasonable construction, we may consider ‘a variety of\n       extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to\n       be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous\n       administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is\n       a part.’ [Citation.] Using these extrinsic aids, we ‘select the construction\n       that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with\n       a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,\n       and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.’\n       [Citation.]” (People v. Sinohui (2002) 28 Cal.4th 205, 211-212.)\n       Where the statutory language is so clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nstatutory construction or to resort to legislative materials or other outside sources.\n(Quarterman v. Kefauver (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371.) Absent ambiguity, it is\npresumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and\nthe courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not\napparent in its language. (People v. ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court (1996) 14 Cal.4th\n294, 301.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              5.\n\f       In determining whether the words enacted here are unambiguous, we do not write\non a blank slate. For example, in Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119\nCal.App.4th 1241, 1255, the court stated there “is nothing ambiguous about the phrase\n‘as used in this code.’” It held the definition of “Emergency, as used in this code”\napplied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter,\narticle, or division of that code. Also, in People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153,\n166, the court held: “The words ‘as in this code provided’ (Penal Code, § 182) refer to\nthe Penal Code.” Thus, the plain meaning rule and stare decisis dictate the conclusion\nthat the definition provided in section 1170.18(c) applies to resentencings under the Act.\n       In a similar vein, the California Supreme Court in People v. Leal (2004) 33\nCal.4th 999, 1007-1008, applied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n               “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n       the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ ([Pen. Code,] §§ 261, subd. (b), 262,\n       subd. (c).) This clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the\n       definitions of ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other\n       sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n              “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n\n\n                                              6.\n\f       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       Because the Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or\ncontradictory to the Act, nor is there a compelling reason not to apply the plain meaning\nrule here. Consequently, this new definition would apply to any resentencing hearings\nunder the Penal Code, including the Act, after November 4, 2014.3\n\n                                                           _________________________\n                                                                             PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n3While  I agree with the majority opinion that section 1170.18(c) has no retroactive\napplication to pending appellate cases, because I conclude a remand for resentencing is\nnecessary here, section 1170.18(c) would apply prospectively to such a resentencing\nhearing if held after November 4, 2014.\n\n\n\n                                            7.\n\f",

(c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)),\nfiled a petition for resentencing under the Act. The trial court found defendant was “not\ndisqualified from resentencing,” but declined to resentence him due to the risk of danger\nto public safety.\n          In the published portion of this opinion, we hold the court did not err by failing to\nappoint an expert on the issue of current dangerousness. In the unpublished portion, we\nconclude the trial court did not use the wrong legal standard, misallocate the burden of\nproof, or abuse its discretion by denying the petition. We also conclude recently enacted\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f). We\naffirm.\n                         FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY*\n          On February 22, 2000, defendant was stopped by a Madera law enforcement\nofficer because he was wearing clothing that matched the description of that worn by an\nattempted robbery suspect officers were trying to locate. Shortly after, defendant was\n\n1         Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n*         See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n\n                                                2.\n\ftaken into custody on unrelated charges. He was found to have five individually wrapped\nplastic bags of heroin in his belongings. While being booked into jail, he spontaneously\nstated he had been making a delivery. After being advised of and waiving his\nconstitutional rights, he explained he was a heroin user who purchased heroin in packages\nto sell to continue supporting his drug habit. On September 8, 2000, defendant pled\nguilty to possession of heroin for sale (Health & Saf. Code, § 11351) and admitted having\ntwo prior strike convictions. On November 9, 2000, he was sentenced to 25 years to life\nin prison.\n       On November 13, 2012, defendant filed a petition to recall his sentence and be\nresentenced pursuant to the Act. He represented he (1) was statutorily eligible for such\nrelief; (2) had a strike record consisting of a 1985 conviction for robbery (in which he\nhanded the clerk a note to complete the crime and which did not involve a weapon) and a\n1992 conviction for first degree burglary; (3) was 59 years old; (4) had not incurred any\ndisciplinary rule infractions since entering the custody of the California Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation in November 2000; (5) had availed himself of academic\nprograms and earned his GED in November 2005; (6) had been actively participating in\nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) since October 2006; and (7) had been actively participating\nin Victim Awareness Offender’s Program (VAOP) since February 2012.2 With respect\nto postrelease plans, defendant stated he had no definite plans for residency, but\nanticipated transitional housing acceptance letters from various programs throughout\nCalifornia. If none were forthcoming, he expected to reside at the Madera Rescue\nMission until he could arrange to relocate to Fresno, where he intended to enroll in a\ntruck driving school. Defendant conceded his criminal history was extensive, but noted\n\n\n\n2     Defendant submitted numerous favorable “chronos” and other documents in\nsupport of his claims.\n\n\n\n                                             3.\n\fhis crimes were primarily property crimes and his criminal history was attributable to his\ndrug use, which he had now addressed.\n       The People opposed the petition. They implicitly conceded defendant was not\ndisqualified from resentencing under the Act, but argued he should not be resentenced\nbecause doing so would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The\nPeople pointed to defendant’s eight felony and 11 misdemeanor convictions dating back\nto 1972; the fact one of his strike priors was a robbery, which by its nature was violent;3\nthe length and number of his prior prison commitments and number of parole violations;\nthe fact that, although the strike offenses were from 1985 and 1992, defendant led a\ncontinuous life of crime before and after those convictions; and the uncertainty of\ndefendant’s parole plans. The People acknowledged defendant’s lack of prison\ndisciplinary record and the fact he had completed numerous vocational/job training,\nsubstance abuse, and academic classes, and agreed he had made commendable gains\nwhile in prison. They argued, however, that his “abysmal” criminal record and over 20\nyears of using drugs and stealing could not be overlooked; moreover, he had never\ndemonstrated an ability to be law abiding or employed. They asserted he was ill\nequipped to return to society, had no real parole plan, would be unable to support himself,\nand was likely to reoffend if released.\n       Defendant responded by writing a letter to the court in which he apologized for his\npast criminal conduct. He again pointed to his lack of in-prison disciplinary record and\nparticipation in self-help groups such as NA. He also detailed steps he intended to take to\nobtain housing and employment, should he be released. In his formal response, he\nargued he did not have a long or consistent history of violence, and pointed to his record\n\n\n\n3       Due to the age of the convictions, the People did not have any information about\nthe circumstances of the prior strike cases.\n\n\n\n                                             4.\n\fof rehabilitation. He asserted there were insufficient facts for the court to find he posed\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n       The petition was heard on August 2, 2013.4 The court invited defense counsel to\nbe heard first. When counsel said everything had been presented in the moving papers\nand he would prefer to respond to whatever the People said unless there was something\nthe court needed to have addressed, the court confirmed it was to consider the original\npetition and exhibits prepared by defendant before counsel was appointed, together with\nthe defense’s response and appended documents. Counsel then argued that although\ndefendant had a lengthy prior record, this was “somewhat natural” for a third strike\noffender, and defendant’s serious and/or violent crimes occurred some time ago. Counsel\nemphasized defendant had been a model prisoner with no disciplinary violations, and had\ndone many things toward rehabilitation. Counsel also noted defendant had been assessed\nby the prison itself as being a low risk to reoffend. Counsel argued defendant had done\neverything he could possibly do, and the People had not presented any evidence to show\nhe was a current risk of danger to the public safety.\n       Asked by the court whether “risk of danger to the public safety” was limited to\nphysical safety, as in violent crimes, or included safety from having other property crimes\nperpetrated against the public, defense counsel argued “dangerousness” and “risk” were\nkey. He analogized the situation to parole cases dealing with life prisoners, and noted\nthose cases involved murderers and so were concerned with whether those prisoners were\ngoing to commit such crimes again. Counsel argued risk of danger and public safety\nmeant more than committing petty theft or second degree burglary, and argued concern\nwith risk of commission of a violent crime would be in line with the Act’s amendments to\nthe three strikes law, because the third strike now had to be a serious or violent felony.\n\n4      The judge who imposed defendant’s third strike sentence was no longer on the\nbench, so the matter was heard by a different judge. (See § 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\f       The prosecutor acknowledged defendant had no disciplinary record while in prison\nand a good record of attendance in rehabilitation programs. He argued there was a\ndifference, however, between one’s behavior in a structured setting such as prison and\nhow one behaves outside of prison. He asserted defendant’s criminal history showed that\ndefendant had been sent to prison many times before, and each time he got out, he\ncommitted new crimes. The prosecutor argued the term “public safety” encompassed the\nsafety of one’s belongings, but in defendant’s case, there was additionally an escalation\nin how property was obtained. The prosecutor argued that between 1972, when\ndefendant was 19 years old, and 2000, defendant was in prison or in jail or violating some\nlaw. The prosecutor also argued defendant’s parole plans (or lack thereof) were relevant,\nand he expressed concern over releasing an individual who had committed crimes over\ndecades, just because he behaved in prison.\n       The court asked defense counsel to address the fact defendant seemed to have a\nproblem complying with the law when not in custody. Counsel responded that the three\nstrikes law was a criminal statute, and if everyone’s petition for resentencing was going\nto be denied because they committed serious and violent crimes, then resentencing should\nnot be included in the law. Thus, the standard was not denial based just on the prior\ncriminal record. Counsel acknowledged the prior record was a relevant factor, but argued\nthe court had to consider the totality of the picture. He emphasized defendant’s good\nbehavior during his time in custody, and argued it was easy to get “written up” for\nsomething in prison, yet defendant had no disciplinary chronos. Counsel argued\ndefendant’s prior record was not evidence defendant was currently a danger. As for\nparole plans, counsel stated he was familiar with Madera Rescue Mission and that, while\nthey would not conclusively accept defendant until he was out of custody and had\ninterviewed with them, defendant would be a suitable candidate for their program.\nCounsel pointed out defendant had also obtained information for workforce programs and\nother agencies, and that he had put time and effort into doing that on his own while still\n\n                                              6.\n\fin prison. The court then confirmed directly with defendant that enrollment in a specific\ntruck driving school was still something he wanted to pursue.\n      This ensued:\n\n             “[THE COURT:] I am directed by the terms of the Prop 36\n      modification to the Three Strikes Law to consider criminal history\n      including the types of crimes, the extent of injuries to the victims, the\n      length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of crimes, and I do\n      have those issues in mind. So I can’t just start with the time when he went\n      into custody and his conduct since then nor can I just limit it to the time\n      before he got into custody.\n\n             “Looking at his in custody time, I don’t think that, on the face of it, I\n      would be asking more of [defendant]. He … has behaved himself, he has\n      followed the rules as far as I can see. I don’t have any reason to believe\n      otherwise. He has done the program, he’s done the Narcotics Anonymous\n      program there, he obtained his GED certificate in 2005, he did go through\n      the Victim Awareness Offenders Program, the VAOP program.\n\n             “And then in the annual review …, it indicates that no serious\n      disciplinary action during his time there. So I think he has done well to the\n      extent that he could do well during his time in custody.\n\n             “He has a history, as I count them of eleven misdemeanors and the\n      eight felonies, and that includes juvenile actions as well. It appears to me\n      that … [defendant] has had difficulty in complying with the rules.\n\n             “[Defense counsel] has indicated that it’s not easy to comply with\n      the rules while in custody, and I understand that and appreciate that.\n\n             “[Defense counsel] also pointed out that in order to reintegrate into\n      society, it’s not easy to do that either. And it appears to me that [defendant]\n      has not been, by his own history here, successful in that regard. I don’t\n      have any appreciable periods of time when he’s been without a criminal\n      conviction.\n\n            “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, … I believe he was free of\n      custody from 1979 to 1984.\n\n             “THE COURT: Was he in custody during that period of time?\n\n             “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, he was out of custody.\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\f             “THE DEFENDANT: I was employed, your Honor. I have a Social\n      Security statement from 2006 which shows I was employed those years, in\n      1979 to early 1984.\n\n             “THE COURT: Okay. So approximately a 5-year period. All right.\n      Then, let me go back there just a moment. I want to look at the records on\n      that. All right. [¶] Any comment in that regard by the People? [¶] … [¶]\n\n             “[PROSECUTOR]: I’ll submit on that, your Honor. I don’t show\n      any record that he was in custody at that time. [¶] … [¶]\n\n             “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I’m sorry, your Honor, the last thing I\n      want to note. Before his last yearly review on his controlled substance, he\n      was classified as a low risk on that.\n\n             “THE COURT: All right. Thank you. And I think you mentioned\n      that .… [¶] And as mentioned by the People, we’ve seen an escalation\n      even without crime during that period 1979 to 1984, the fact that we have\n      the felony first degree burglary in 1992.\n\n              “So I’m not going to find that he does not present a danger to\n      reoffend or to present a danger to society or to safety of the public. I find\n      that there is a reasonable risk of danger if he would be released on that\n      basis.\n\n             “As noted by the People, there has been an escalation in the type of\n      crime .… [¶] … And looking at whether the circumstances of his\n      commitment offenses were considered, I have considered those. And his\n      offenses are of concern because it has escalated.\n\n              “If it was just a crime, not serious or violent, we wouldn’t be here in\n      the first place but he’s got a consistent series of crimes during the time he’s\n      out. The greatest period of which he was without crime was the one that\n      was just mentioned by the defense. So I’m not ordering that he be\n      resentenced.”\n      Defense counsel then sought clarification whether the court interpreted\n“unreasonable risk to the public safety” to mean a risk that defendant commit any crime,\nor serious or violent crimes. The court responded: “My interpretation is that to the\nextent that he’s committing any crime, it’s something that I consider to whether — to the\nissue whether he would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public safety.” When\ncounsel suggested the court was putting a great deal more weight on defendant’s prior\n\n                                            8.\n\frecord than on his in-custody record, the court stated: “Well, I don’t know how you want\nto quantify that, Counsel. I’m considering both his time in custody … and then his\nhistory in crimes committed .… So upon balance, it appears to me that it would be an\nunreasonable risk to the danger to the public safety for the resentencing.” When counsel\nasked whether the court was “not giving any weight to the prison’s evaluation — the\npeople that know [defendant] the best, that they consider him a low risk to reoffend,” the\ncourt responded it had considered that as well.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Defendant says he is entitled to a remand for reconsideration of his petition,\nbecause the sentencing court (1) applied the wrong legal standard; (2) misallocated the\nburden of proof; (3) abused its discretion in considering the evidence, because it engaged\nin unfounded speculation without obtaining an expert evaluation; and (4) abused its\ndiscretion by denying relief based solely on defendant’s remote history of recidivism. In\nconjunction with the last claim, defendant says the court’s ruling is not supported by\nsufficient evidence, because his remote recidivist behavior did not preponderate over the\nextensive evidence of his more recent exemplary behavior and accomplishments. We\ndisagree that remand is required.\n                                              I*\n                                     STANDARD OF PROOF\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.5 (People v.

If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd.

Carmony, supra, 33\n       Cal.4th at pp. 376-377.)\n       “Because ‘all discretionary authority is contextual’ [citation], we cannot determine\nwhether a trial court has acted irrationally or arbitrarily … without considering the legal\nprinciples and policies that should have guided the court’s actions.” (People v. Carmony,\nsupra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 377.) “An abuse of discretion is shown when the trial court\napplies the wrong legal standard. [Citation.]” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v.

Article V, section 8, subdivision (b) of the California\nConstitution gives the Governor the power to review the parole authority’s decision.\n“Although ‘the Governor’s decision must be based upon the same factors that restrict the\n[parole authority] in rendering its parole decision’ [citation], the Governor undertakes an\nindependent, de novo review of the inmate’s suitability for parole.

The California Constitution\ngives the state’s executive specific powers of review over parole decisions. (Cal. Const.,\nart. V, § 8, subd. (b).) At the time that constitutional provision was adopted, courts\napplied the “some evidence” test directly to the decisions of the parole authority.

The Attorney General disagrees and argues that under the clear\nlanguage of section 1170.126, we review for abuse of discretion. The Attorney General\nconcludes: “[T]he trial court has discretion to determine an inmate’s risk of danger to\npublic safety based on evidence the court deems relevant. And just like other sentencing\ndecisions, the trial court’s exercise of its discretion in the section 1170.126 context\nshould be supported by stated factors and reviewed for an abuse of discretion.”\n       We agree we review a trial court’s ultimate decision whether to resentence an\ninmate under the Act — its determination whether “resentencing the petitioner would\npose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) — for abuse\nof discretion. If there is no evidence in the record to support the decision, the decision\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion. (See In re Robert L.

As the Attorney General’s reference to the trial court’s determination being based\non evidence and supported by stated factors shows, the questions arise which party must\nproduce such evidence, and to what degree of certainty, and what level of support —\nwhat standard of proof — is required for a trial court to rely on such evidence or factors?\n(See People v.

Instead, considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126,\nwe conclude it means the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, facts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made.8 Stated another\nway, evidence showing a petitioner poses a risk of danger to public safety must be proven\nby the People by a preponderance. The reasons a trial court finds resentencing would\npose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence showing dangerousness\nversus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s discretion. The ultimate\ndetermination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a\ndiscretionary one. While the determination must be supported by record evidence\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\n\n\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act and a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n7       The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard. (People v. Wong (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2305872\"><a href=\"/opinion/2305872/people-v-wong/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n8      We do not interpret the Attorney General’s argument as taking serious issue with\nthe notion that whatever burden exists is allocated to the prosecution. Courts and parties\nhave assumed the burden is on the People (e.g., People v. Flores (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence\nstandards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.9 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to Cunningham\nv. California (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145761\"><a href=\"/opinion/145761/cunningham-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cunningham), “three terms of imprisonment [were]\nspecified by statute for most offenses. The trial court’s discretion in selecting among\n[those] options [was] limited by section 1170, subdivision (b), which direct[ed] that ‘the\ncourt shall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are circumstances in\naggravation or mitigation of the crime.’” (People v. Black (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599812\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599812/people-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 808,\nfn. omitted.) Trial courts had “broad discretion” to impose the lower or upper term\ninstead of the middle term of imprisonment (People v. Scott (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2614075\"><a href=\"/opinion/2614075/people-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349),\nand generally were required by the statutes and sentencing rules to state reasons for their\ndiscretionary sentencing choices (ibid.). Such reasons had to be “supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence in the record” and reasonably related to the particular\nsentencing determination. (Ibid.; see former Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.420(b).) Even\nafter the DSL was reformed and amended in response to Cunningham, so as to eliminate\njudicial factfinding in selection of the appropriate term when three possible prison terms\nare specified by statute, establishment of facts by a preponderance of the evidence\nremains necessary with respect to certain discretionary sentencing decisions. (See In re\nColey (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557-558.)10\n\n9      The determination of the appropriate penalty in a capital case “‘is “essentially\nmoral and normative …, and therefore … there is no burden of proof or burden of\npersuasion.

Such an evaluation “is not equivalent to a\nfactual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It follows, then,\nthat the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in that it\nneed not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “‘more likely than not’”].)\n       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court may base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\n\n\naggravating or mitigating facts found by the trial judge; and (2) a trial judge has the\ndiscretion to impose an upper, middle or lower term based on reasons he or she states.”\n(People v.

Subdivision (b) of section 1170\nstates the court “shall select the term which, in the court’s discretion, best serves the\ninterests of justice.”\n\n\n\n                                              16.\n\fwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself. Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation. Kaulick\nstated, in part: “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly situated to\nhim, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life term to which he was\noriginally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him with an opportunity to be resentenced\nto a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the\nthird strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was originally\nsentenced. As such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\nhis favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and\nsuch factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Id.\nat p. 1303, italics added.) The court further stated: “[I]t is the general rule in California\nthat once a defendant is eligible for an increased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its\ndiscretion to impose that penalty, may rely on factors established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1305, italics added.)\n       To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its\nfinding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within\n“the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Giminez (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1190257\"><a href=\"/opinion/1190257/people-v-giminez/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72.) The facts or evidence upon which the court’s\nfinding of unreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial evidence.\nIf a factor (for example, that the petitioner recently committed a battery, is violent due to\nrepeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a preponderance of the\nevidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk.

Kaulick was decided slightly more than three months\nbefore the hearing on defendant’s petition. We presume the court was aware of that\ndecision.

In his response to\nthe People’s opposition, defendant argued there were “insufficient facts” to allow the\ncourt to find defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and argued\nthe interests of justice would be served by resentencing him based on his rehabilitation\nrecord and “the lack of evidence” he posed an unreasonable risk to public safety. At the\nhearing, defendant argued the People had not presented any evidence to show he was\ncurrently a risk of danger to public safety.\n\n\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n\n                                               18.\n\f       In light of the totality of its comments and the argument before it, we conclude the\ntrial court properly allocated the burden of proof to the People and determined, in an\nexercise of its discretion, that resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.11\n                                             III\n                       FAILURE TO OBTAIN EXPERT EVALUATION\n       Defendant says resentencing him as a second strike offender would have released\nhim on postrelease community supervision (PRCS).

Thus, he argues, the court was confronted with a situation similar to the decision\nwhether to grant parole to a life prisoner (see § 3041); in that context, current\npsychological evaluations are generally most relevant to an assessment of current\ndangerousness (see In re Lawrence (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1223-1224), and the court\nhere erred by failing to enlist, sua sponte, the assistance of an expert. Defendant says the\ncourt abused its discretion by engaging in unfounded speculation concerning, and relying\non its own nonexpert estimation of, defendant’s psychological state with respect to\nwhether defendant was still prone to reoffending outside the custodial setting.\n       Defendant cites Evidence Code section 730 for the proposition an expert may be\nappointed by a court sua sponte for the purpose of obtaining an impartial expert\nopinion.12 (See Mercury Casualty Co. v.

Regardless of whether a proceeding under section 1170.126 is\nlikened to a trial or is part of a sentencing proceeding, “a trial court has inherent power,\nindependent of statute, to exercise its discretion and control over all proceedings relating\nto the litigation before it [citation],” including “the power to obtain evidence upon which\nthe judgment of the court may rest [citation].” (Johnson v.

In that\ncase, the Governor reversed a parole grant in part based on negative language found in\nearly psychiatric evaluations of the inmate that suggested the inmate’s release would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to the public. (Id. at pp. 1190, 1223.) The California\nSupreme Court rejected the Governor’s conclusion, stating: “[T]he passage of time is\nhighly probative to the determination before us, and reliance upon outdated psychological\nreports — clearly contradicted by [the inmate’s] successful participation in years of\nintensive therapy, a long series of reports declaring [the inmate] to be free of\npsychological problems and no longer a threat to public safety, and [the inmate’s] own\ninsight into her participation in this crime — does not supply some evidence justifying\nthe Governor’s conclusion that [the inmate] continues to pose a threat to public safety.”\n(Id. at p. 1224.)\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n\n                                            21.\n\frisk of danger to public safety. The trial court gave due consideration to all the\ninformation before it, and so determined.14 Defendant’s record, including the fact he\nsuffered numerous convictions over a long period of time and into his late 40’s; his\nextensive number of parole violations for which he was returned to prison; and his\ninability to remain crime- or violation-free for any appreciable period of time;15\n\n14      The trial court correctly framed the pertinent issue as an inquiry into the risk of\nrecidivism in general, rather than the likelihood of future violence. Words and phrases\nused in the Penal Code “must be construed according to the context and the approved\nusage of the language .…” (§ 7, subd. 16.)

(e)(2)(C)(i), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(i)). Although the ballot materials\nconcerning Proposition 36 focused on violent criminals, uncodified section 7 of the Act\nprovides: “This act is an exercise of the public power of the people of the State of\nCalifornia for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of\nCalifornia, and shall be liberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Italics\nomitted.) To condition resentencing denials upon the likelihood of future violence would\nrun contrary to the language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) and voters’ intent, and\nwould not effectuate the purposes of the Act.\n15     At the hearing, defendant represented, and the trial court accepted, that defendant\nremained free of custody from 1979 to 1984, during which time he was employed. The\nprobation officer’s report prepared in conjunction with the section 1170.126 hearing\nshowed, however, that defendant was convicted of three misdemeanors, for which he\nreceived some jail time, and an offense for which he received summary probation and\ncommunity service, during that period. Moreover, he committed the robbery that\nconstituted one of his strike priors in late 1984.\n\n\n\n                                             22.\n\freasonably supports the conclusion — even in light of a perfect prison behavior record —\nthat, although defendant thrives in prison, he does the opposite when released.16\nAccordingly, the trial court’s ruling fell within the bounds of reason.\n                                                V*\n                            SECTION 1170.18, SUBDIVISION (C)\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd.

Espinoza, supra, 226\nCal.App.4th at pp. 637-638) does not alter our analysis or conclusion.\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n17    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors.

Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\n\n\n\n\n                                            24.\n\fdefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense.

Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n\n\n                                             27.\n\f       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247818/people-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)\n\n19      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’” (See Historical\nand Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                            28.\n\f       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, as we previously observed, uncodified section 7 of the Act\nprovides: “This act is an exercise of the public power of the people of the State of\nCalifornia for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of\nCalifornia, and shall be liberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110,\noriginal italics omitted, italics added.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at page 1036, “Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\n\n                                             29.\n\fpeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\nstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\n\n                                              30.\n\funreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\nanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n\n\n\n                                            31.\n\f(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\nwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\nProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n2014) Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-\nproposition47-20141106-story.html> [as of Feb. 5, 2015].) Looking at the information\nconveyed to voters, however, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is\nof no import. (Cf. People v.

Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition.

Because nowhere in the\nballot materials for Proposition 47 was it called to voters’ attention the definition of the\nphrase contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) would apply to resentencing\nproceedings under the Act, we simply cannot conclude voters intended Proposition 47 to\nalter the Act in that respect. Voters are not asked or presumed to be able to discern all\npotential effects of a proposed initiative measure; this is why they are provided with voter\ninformation guides containing not only the actual text of such a measure, but also a\nneutral explanation and analysis by the Legislative Analyst and arguments in support of\nand in opposition to the measure. As we have already observed, none of those materials\nso much as hinted that Proposition 47 could have the slightest effect on resentencing\nunder the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of enactment included information bill would add\ndefinition of particular term to Public Contract Code].)20\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code.

There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony.

We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\nsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict.

In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1381592\"><a href=\"/opinion/1381592/stone-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v.

Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\n\n                                            34.\n\fwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v.

Defendant is not entitled to a remand so the trial court can redetermine\ndefendant’s entitlement to resentencing under the Act utilizing the definition of\n“‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c).21\n\n\n\n\n21      Recently, the Third District Court of Appeal held section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c)’s definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” does not\napply retroactively to defendants whose petitions for resentencing under the Act were\ndecided before the effective date of Proposition 47. (People v. Chaney (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Chaney, supra, at p. 1397, fn. 3.) Were we to conclude section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126, subdivision (f), we would agree with Chaney\nthat it does not do so retroactively. We believe, however, that a finding of\nnonretroactivity inexorably leads to the possibility of prospective-only application, and\nthat prospective-only application of Proposition 47’s definition to resentencing petitions\nunder the Act would raise serious, perhaps insurmountable, equal protection issues.\n“Mindful of the serious constitutional questions that might arise were we to accept a\nliteral construction of the statutory language, and of our obligation wherever possible\nboth to carry out the intent of the electorate and to construe statutes so as to preserve their\nconstitutionality [citations]” (People v.

I agree the trial\ncourt could, but was not required to, appoint an expert to evaluate defendant Timothy\nJames Rodriguez on the question of his current dangerousness. I would remand the\nmatter for resentencing, however, because it appears the trial court abused its discretion\nin denying resentencing on grounds unsupported by the evidence. A remand would\npermit the trial court to consider any changed circumstances establishing unreasonable\nrisk of dangerousness since the original hearing date of August 2, 2013. This would\ninclude the recent clarification of the meaning of the phrase “unreasonable risk of\ndangerousness” by Proposition 47’s1 enactment of Penal Code section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) (§ 1170.18(c)).\nANALYSIS\n       On February 22, 2000, defendant was arrested with five bindles of heroin. He\npled guilty to the crime of possession of heroin for sale in September of 2000 and was\nsentenced to 25 years to life on November 9, 2000, based on prior “strike” convictions\nfor robbery in 1984 and a first degree burglary in 1992. (§§ 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12,\nsubds. (a)-(e).) Between the current charge and the 1992 burglary “strike,” he suffered a\nmisdemeanor drug conviction in 1994 and a misdemeanor resisting or delaying arrest in\nviolation of Penal Code section 148 in 1998. He filed his petition for resentencing on\nNovember 13, 2012, and his petition was heard on August 2, 2013, roughly 13 and one-\nhalf years since his heroin possession for sale offense. Since that time, defendant\nsuffered no new convictions, no disciplinary violations in prison, and no “write-ups,” not\none. Instead, defendant obtained his GED and was awarded certificates of completion for\nvarious courses of academic education. He worked in the prison as a porter and a\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014)).\n\fteacher’s aid and was recognized as “an outstanding worker.” He was a member in good\nstanding of the “Lifers Group,” he had outstanding attendance in the 12-step recovery\nprogram of Narcotics Anonymous beginning in 2005, and he completed phases 1 and 2 of\nthe Victim Awareness Offenders Program. He was 59 years old at the time of the\nhearing.\n       The prosecutor agreed defendant was a “model prisoner.” He argued against\nresentencing, however, based on defendant’s “history of petty theft,” which he called a\n“petty theft problem,” and his escalating history of crime, referring to his robbery in 1984\nand his residential burglary in 1992. He repeatedly emphasized this,2 concluding:\n\n       “So our concern isn’t so much how the defendant behaves in prison, our\n       concern is what has consistently happened when released from prison, and\n       not just a safety of property but when it escalates into these actual violent\n       serious crimes as it has in the past.”\n\n\n2“[PROSECUTOR]:   Addressing specifically, if it’s—what exactly the term ‘public safety’\nmeans. There is room, I think, to look at the safety of having your belongings, you know,\nkept secure. But more so, what we see here is an escalation in how property is obtained.\n“We’re just not dealing with a history of petty theft. I think we can see from the record\nwe have a petty theft problem. But then we see that some times it escalates—it’s\nescalated [into] counts of 211 in 1984 and to a 459 first degree in 1992. So it has\nescalated, these property crimes, into crimes in which we do have what’s considered\nviolent and serious felonies.\n“More so too, if you look at the—it extends his entire life from 1972, I believe when he\nwas 19 years old. And then in 1998, we still have a 148 PC, resisting an officer, until the\npresent offense in 2000, and there’s just—either the defendant seems to be in prison or in\njail or he seems to be violating some law. This is a great concern because I think there’s\na difference between cases where you have two strikes and no other record, and I’ve seen\nthose, and cases where you have two strikes and a dozen other offenses.\n“I think when looking at who’s a reasonable danger to society, you have to look and see\nare we dealing with a fundamental issue with the individual where he has shown that all\nmodes of rehabilitation when outside of prison have failed and they escalate. And in this\ncase, they have escalated in both occasions into robberies and then into first degree\nburglaries as well.”\n\n\n\n                                             2.\n\f       The evidence does not, however, support a finding of an escalation in defendant’s\ncommission of crime since his strike convictions. Instead, as noted above, since his 1992\nresidential burglary, defendant’s crimes have deescalated with defendant committing two\nmisdemeanors and a felony possession for sale of heroin in early 2000, resulting in his\nlife sentence.\n       Unfortunately, in denying resentencing, the court adopted the prosecutor’s\nunsupported reasoning of an escalating pattern of criminal conduct:\n\n              “THE COURT: [A]s mentioned by the People, we’ve seen an\n       escalation even without crime during that period 1979 to 1984, the fact that\n       we have the felony first degree burglary in 1992.\n\n               “So I’m not going to find that he does not present a danger to\n       reoffend or to present a danger to society or to safety of the public. I find\n       there is a reasonable risk of danger if he would be released on that basis.\n\n              “As noted by the People, there has been an escalation in the type of\n       crime, so that is my finding, based upon the information provided.\n\n             “I am aware of the Lawrence case and Shaputis. And I think\n       Shaputis was also cited by the People as well. And looking at whether the\n       circumstances of his commitment offenses were considered, I have\n       considered those. And his offenses are of concern because it has escalated.\n\n               “If it was just a crime, not serious or violent, we wouldn’t be here in\n       the first place but he’s got a consistent series of crimes during the time he’s\n       out. The greatest period of which he was without crime was the one that\n       was just mentioned by the defense. So I’m not ordering that he be\n       resentenced.”\n       Setting aside the fact the standard provided by the law requires a finding of\n“unreasonable risk of danger” not “reasonable risk of danger,” which might be attributed\nto the court simply misspeaking, the facts do not support the conclusion. It seems clear\nthe evidence does not support a finding of “an escalation in the type of crime,” which the\ncourt’s statements appeared to show was the critical finding it relied upon to deny\nresentencing. “A trial court abuses its discretion when the factual findings critical to its\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fdecision find no support in the evidence.” (People v.

Consequently, the trial court abused its discretion by denying resentencing on the\ngrounds of “an escalation of crimes.”\n       Defendant has not had “an escalation” of crimes since his last strike—the\nresidential burglary in 1992, which he committed before the three strikes law was\nenacted. Defendant has gone 21 years without an escalation in crime since his residential\nburglary conviction in 1992. Rather, the opposite is true—his crimes since 1992 (two\nmisdemeanors and felony drug possession for sale) signaled a retreat from violent or\nserious felonies. In fact, defendant had no crimes for the previous 13 and one-half years.\nAlthough in custody during that time, defendant has had no violations of any sort during\nthat period.\n       It is true defendant had a history of theft crimes and other violations up until 2000,\nwhen he received his “Three Strikes” sentence. However, this is only one of many\nfactors the trial court may consider in the exercise of its discretion to resentence under\nPenal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (g). More importantly, the trial court may not\nrely on factors unsupported by the evidence that are critical to its decision, as occurred\nhere. (People v.

Therefore, the matter should be\nremanded for resentencing unless the record shows changed circumstances establishing\nunreasonable risk of dangerousness since the hearing date of August 2, 2013.\n       In addition, I would direct the trial court to apply the current definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger” in its resentencing hearing, as provided in section\n1170.18(c). I respectfully disagree with the majority’s analysis that section 1170.18(c)\n\n                                              4.\n\fhas no application to resentencing under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes Reform Act of\n2012 (the Act).\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, and went into effect the next day (Cal. Const., art II, § 10,\nsubd. (a).) Thus, it would apply to a new resentencing hearing under the Act.\n\n               “‘When construing a statute, we must “ascertain the intent of the\n       Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.”’ [Citations.] ‘[W]e\n       begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary\n       meaning.’ [Citation.] ‘If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,\n       then we need go no further.’ [Citation.] If, however, the language supports\n       more than one reasonable construction, we may consider ‘a variety of\n       extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to\n       be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous\n       administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is\n       a part.’ [Citation.] Using these extrinsic aids, we ‘select the construction\n       that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with\n       a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,\n       and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.’\n       [Citation.]” (People v. Sinohui (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521223\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521223/people-v-sinohui/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 211-212.)\n       Where the statutory language is so clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nstatutory construction or to resort to legislative materials or other outside sources.\n(Quarterman v.

Absent ambiguity, it is\npresumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and\nthe courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not\napparent in its language.

For example, in Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1255, the court stated there “is nothing ambiguous about the phrase\n‘as used in this code.’” It held the definition of “Emergency, as used in this code”\napplied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter,\narticle, or division of that code. Also, in People v. Bucchierre (1943) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n166, the court held: “The words ‘as in this code provided’ (Penal Code, § 182) refer to\nthe Penal Code.” Thus, the plain meaning rule and stare decisis dictate the conclusion\nthat the definition provided in section 1170.18(c) applies to resentencings under the Act.\n       In a similar vein, the California Supreme Court in People v. Leal (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548607\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548607/people-v-leal/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1007-1008, applied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n               “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n       the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ ([Pen. Code,] §§ 261, subd. (b), 262,\n       subd. (c).) This clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the\n       definitions of ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other\n       sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n              “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n\n\n                                              6.\n\f       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       Because the Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or\ncontradictory to the Act, nor is there a compelling reason not to apply the plain meaning\nrule here. Consequently, this new definition would apply to any resentencing hearings\nunder the Penal Code, including the Act, after November 4, 2014.3\n\n                                                           _________________________\n                                                                             PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n3While  I agree with the majority opinion that section 1170.18(c) has no retroactive\napplication to pending appellate cases, because I conclude a remand for resentencing is\nnecessary here, section 1170.18(c) would apply prospectively to such a resentencing\nhearing if held after November 4, 2014.\n\n\n\n                                            7.\n\f</pre>",
