The District Court determined, on defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment, that plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination because he had not\n\nidentified evidence sufficient to support an inference of discrimination. We disagree. Plaintiff’s\n\nevidence included: (1) his supervisor’s statement indicating that men have a propensity to commit\n\nsexual harassment and (2) defendants’ arguable failure to investigate properly the charges of sexual\n\nharassment lodged against plaintiff. This evidence would permit a reasonable jury to infer\n\ndiscrimination based on sex stereotyping.

WALTER, Walter, Thayer & Mishler, P.C., Albany,\n                                             NY, for Plaintiff-Appellant.\n\n                                       KAREN FOLSTER LESPERANCE , McCabe & Mack LLP,\n                                            Poughkeepsie, NY, for Defendants-Appellees.\n\nJOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge:\n\n        In this Title VII action, plaintiff-appellant Carl Thomas Sassaman charges his former employer\n\nand supervisor—defendants-appellees David Gamache, Commissioner of the Dutchess County Board\n\nof Elections, the Dutchess County Board of Elections, and Dutchess County—with sex discrimination.\n\nSassaman alleges that defendants pressured him to resign because of a sex stereotype regarding the\n\npropensity of men to sexually harass their female co-workers. The United States District Court for the\n\nSouthern District of New York (Charles L. Brieant, Judge) granted defendants summary judgment on\n\nthe grounds that Sassaman had not identified evidence sufficient to support an inference of\n\ndiscrimination and therefore had failed to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination. On appeal,\n\nwe consider whether a reasonable jury could infer discrimination based on sex stereotyping in light of\n\nSassaman’s evidence that his supervisor believed that men have a propensity to commit sexual\n\nharassment and defendants’ arguable failure to investigate properly the charges of sexual harassment\n\nlodged against Sassaman. As explained in further detail below, we conclude that this evidence was\n\nsufficient to meet Sassaman’s minimal burden of establishing a prima facie case of sex discrimination in\n\nviolation of Title VII.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n        Unless otherwise indicated, the facts set forth in this section are drawn from the record of the\n\nproceedings before the District Court and are not contested by the parties.\n\n\n                                                    2\n\f       In early 2003, plaintiff-appellant Carl Thomas Sassaman joined the staff of the Dutchess\n\nCounty Board of Elections (the “Board”) as an Elections Administrator, working under defendant-\n\nappellee David Gamache, the Republican Commissioner of the Board. Due to a printing error in\n\nOctober 2004, that year’s election ballots had to be reprinted, and Sassaman was “assigned to oversee[ ]\n\nthe budget issue regarding” this unanticipated expense. J.A. 24, 59-60. After it was determined that\n\nreprinting the ballots would require the allocation of an additional $16,000 to the Board’s budget,\n\nCommissioner Gamache met with state legislators to request the funds. Gamache felt humiliated and\n\nembarrassed by the experience, and he appears to have blamed Sassaman for putting him in the\n\nposition of requesting additional funds from the legislature. After communicating his dissatisfaction to\n\nSassaman, Gamache announced that he was demoting Sassaman to Elections Specialist, effective\n\nJanuary 1, 2005. Gamache filled Sassaman’s position, Elections Administrator, with Michelle Brant,\n\nthen an Elections Specialist. In effect, Sassaman and Brant traded positions at the Board.\n\n       Sassaman suspected that a romantic relationship between Brant and Gamache played a part in\n\nhis demotion and Brant’s promotion. According to Sassaman’s deposition testimony, he confronted\n\nBrant over the telephone on December 19, 2004, and revealed his suspicions. Brant allegedly denied\n\nany romantic involvement with Gamache, and Sassaman claims that he sent Brant a note of apology.\n\n       Prior to their reversal of job positions, Sassaman and Brant enjoyed a friendly working\n\nrelationship, marked by eating lunches and smoking cigarettes together. Their relationship soured in\n\nlate January 2005, almost a month after Sassaman’s demotion and Brant’s promotion had taken effect.\n\nA telephone call placed by Sassaman to Brant on Saturday, January 29, 2008 appears to have been the\n\nturning point in their relationship. In that call, Sassaman asked Brant whether she would like to meet\n\nhim out for a drink. When she declined, he suggested that they meet for coffee instead, but she\n\ndeclined that offer as well. Sassaman contends that Brant revealed intimate aspects of her personal life\n\n\n                                                    3\n\fto him during that telephone conversation and tried to ascertain whether he would be interested in\n\nengaging in a one-time sexual encounter. In light of these alleged revelations, Sassaman testified that he\n\ndecided that “[he] was not going to remain friends with her anymore.” Id. at 134. Shortly thereafter,\n\nBrant, who apparently had a different understanding of their telephone conversation, responded to\n\nSassaman’s changed demeanor by asking him whether he was “going to let [their] friendship go down\n\nthe tubes” because she did not want to have sex with him. Id. at 25, 60-61. The parties dispute\n\nwhether Sassaman responded that he did not have any interest in having sex with Brant.\n\n         In early March 2005, Sassaman noticed, looking over Brant’s shoulder at her computer screen,\n\nthat Brant had typed his name in an e-mail. The following day, Sassaman logged into Brant’s computer,\n\ngained access to her e-mail account, and read the e-mail that he had observed her typing the day\n\nbefore.1 Brant later discovered that her e-mail account had been breached and reported the conduct to\n\nGamache. Gamache and Deputy Commissioner John Kennedy summoned Sassaman to discuss the\n\nincident and Sassaman admitted that he was the one to enter Brant’s e-mail account. The parties\n\ndispute whether Gamache and Kennedy warned Sassaman that such conduct could not continue.\n\n         Within days, Gamache called another meeting with Sassaman to inform him that Brant had\n\ncomplained of Sassaman’s “harassing and stalking her.” Id. at 26, 61. Gamache told Sassaman that\n\nBrant claimed to fear Sassaman and had stayed out of the office for that reason. Sassaman was\n\nsuspended from work with pay. On March 10, 2005, Brant submitted a written complaint describing\n\nSassaman’s conduct, and Gamache referred her complaint to the Dutchess County Sheriff’s Office for\n\ninvestigation. He did not refer the matter for an internal investigation. Officers from the Sheriff’s\n\nOffice interviewed Brant and Sassaman. During his interview, Sassaman denied ever calling Brant at\n\n\n\n         1\n           Sassaman contends that his actions were not unprecedented because he had previously gained access to\nBrant’s e-mail account when she was absent from the office and he was “assigned to her desk.” J.A. 61.\n\n                                                            4\n\fhome or sending her notes. When pressed further, Sassaman admitted that he had both called Brant at\n\nhome and sent her at least one note. Sassaman attributes the discrepancy between his initial responses\n\nand subsequent admissions to his belief that “he was being interviewed about sexual harassment and he\n\nnever called or wrote a note that could reasonably be considered sexually harassing.” Id. at 62-63.\n\nUpon completing its investigation, the Sheriff’s Office concluded, in a report dated March 16, 2005,\n\n“At this time insufficient evidence exists to support any type of criminal charges.” Id. at 51.\n\n        While the matter was being investigated by the Sheriff’s Office, Sassaman met with Gamache\n\ntwice. According to Sassaman, these meeting were brief and held at a local diner. Shortly thereafter,\n\nSassaman retained counsel, who then participated in two more meetings with Gamache.\n\n        On March 21, 2005, Gamache informed Sassaman by telephone that he would be terminated\n\nunless he chose to resign. According to Sassaman’s deposition testimony, Gamache defended his\n\ndecision by explaining, “I really don’t have any choice. Michelle [Brant] knows a lot of attorneys; I’m\n\nafraid she’ll sue me. And besides you probably did what she said you did because you’re male and\n\nnobody would believe you anyway.” J.A. 176. In response, Sassaman resigned effective April 1, 2005.\n\n        After exhausting his administrative remedies, Sassaman brought this action in the District\n\nCourt, alleging that defendant-appellees Gamache, the Dutchess County Board of Elections, and\n\nDutchess County terminated him on the basis of sex stereotyping in violation of Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).2 The parties conducted discovery, and, upon the completion of\n\n\n\n        2\n            Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a),\n\n        It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n        individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n        conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n        origin; or (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would\n        deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status\n        as an employee, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n\n\n                                                             5\n\fdiscovery, defendants moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure. In an oral decision, the District Court granted defendants’ motion, determining that\n\nSassaman failed to identify “evidence which would permit a rational fact finder to find an inference of\n\ndiscrimination based on sex.” Tr. 13. With respect to the statement of Gamache to Sassaman that\n\n“you probably did what she said you did because you’re male,” the District Court “[did not] attach any\n\nreal significance to that statement, assuming it was made.” Id. at 12. The District Court discounted the\n\ncomments attributed to Gamache as “stray” and “ambigu[ous]” and incapable of “demonstrat[ing]\n\nactionable gender stereotyping,” and reasoned that “such a viewpoint, even if held, would [not]\n\nnecessarily taint an employment decision to respond to a harassment complaint.” Id. at 12-13. For\n\nthese reasons, the District Court concluded that Sassaman had failed to establish a prima facie case of sex\n\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII and granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Id. at\n\n13-15.\n\n         This appeal followed.\n\n                                              DISCUSSION\n\n         On appeal, Sassaman challenges the District Court’s determination that he failed to present a\n\nprima facie case of sex discrimination in violation of Title VII. We review de novo the District Court’s\n\ndecision to grant summary judgment in favor of defendants, and, in the course of that review, we draw\n\nall permissible factual inferences in favor of Sassaman, the non-moving party. See, e.g., Holcomb v. Iona\n\nCollege, 521 F.3d 130, 137 (2d Cir. 2008). To establish a prima facie Title VII case, a plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate that “(1) that he belonged to a protected class; (2) that he was qualified for the position he\n\nheld; (3) that he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that the adverse employment action\n\noccurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.” Id. at 138. The\n\nSupreme Court has used the adjective “minimal” to describe the burden of establishing a prima facie case\n\n\n                                                      6\n\fof discrimination in violation of Title VII, St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993), and\n\nwe have likewise held that the “plaintiff’s burden of establishing a prima facie [Title VII] case is de\n\nminimis,” Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 239 F.3d 456, 467 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n        For the purposes of their motion for summary judgment, defendants assume that Sassaman has\n\nestablished the first three elements of a prima facie case, but they dispute whether Sassaman has\n\nestablished the fourth element—namely, that the circumstances gave rise to an inference of\n\ndiscriminatory intent. Under our precedent, an inference of discriminatory intent may be established\n\nby, inter alia, “the employer’s . . . invidious comments about others in the employee’s protected group;\n\nor . . . the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff’s discharge.” Id. at 468 (quoting Chambers v. TRM\n\nCopy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994). Sassaman argues that he met this burden by producing\n\nevidence showing that (1) his supervisor, Gamache, made what could be construed as an invidious\n\ncomment about the propensity of men to harass sexually their female colleagues; and (2) defendants\n\nfailed to investigate properly the charges of sexual harassment lodged against Sassaman—charges that\n\nled directly to his forced resignation. Defendants respond that Gamache’s comment on the propensity\n\nof men to engage in sexual harassment was nothing more than a “mere stray remark,” and their\n\ninvestigation of the allegations against Sassaman was not tainted by any bias. Appellees’ Br. 13, 32.\n\n        Considering first Sassaman’s testimony that Gamache told him, “you probably did what [Brant]\n\nsaid you did because you’re male,” J.A. 176, we agree with Sassaman that a reasonable jury could\n\nconstrue this statement as an invidious sex stereotype. As the Supreme Court explained in Price\n\nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, “we are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming\n\nor insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group.” 490 U.S. 228, 251 (1989)\n\n(superceded by statute on other grounds). In that case, the Supreme Court “discern[ed] sex\n\nstereotyping in a description of an aggressive female employee as requiring ‘a course at charm school,’”\n\n\n                                                       7\n\fand it observed that “if an employee’s flawed ‘interpersonal skills’ can be corrected by a soft-hued suit\n\nor a new shade of lipstick, perhaps it is the employee’s sex and not her interpersonal skills that has\n\ndrawn the criticism.” Id. at 256. Construing the facts at issue in the light most favorable to Sassaman,\n\nas we must under controlling authority, the alleged sex stereotyping is more overt: Gamache appears to\n\nhave defended his decision to credit Brant’s allegations of sexual harassment by pointing to the\n\npropensity of men, as a group, to sexually harass women. When employment decisions are based on\n\ninvidious sex stereotypes, a reasonable jury could infer the existence of discriminatory intent. See, e.g.,\n\nBack v. Hastings on Hudson Union Free Sch. Dist., 365 F.3d 107, 120 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that comments\n\nmade about a woman’s inability to combine work and motherhood constitute sex stereotyping that\n\nprovides evidence of discriminatory intent).\n\n         Defendants dispute Sassaman’s interpretation of Gamache’s remarks. They argue that the\n\nstatement, in context,3 was “something of an aside after the termination decision had been made, and\n\nwas not an expression of the reason for [Sassaman’s] termination, but rather an opinion as to what\n\nothers may think.” Appellees’ Br. 15. Whether Sassaman’s interpretation or that of defendants best\n\ncaptures the meaning of Gamache’s statement is not properly decided by this Court, or by the District\n\nCourt, on a motion for summary judgment. Insofar as the comment might be ambiguous, it is “our\n\nobligation at this stage to interpret ambiguities in the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff.” Tomassi v. Insignia Financial Group, Inc., 478 F.3d 111, 116 (2d Cir. 2007). The choice between\n\nplausible interpretations of Gamache’s remarks is a question of fact to be resolved by a jury. See, e.g.,\n\nCronin v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 46 F.3d 196, 206 (2d Cir. 1995) (“[The defendant’s] characterization [of a\n\nletter] might, if proffered through sworn testimony, raise questions of fact to be resolved at trial. It\n\n\n         3\n          As noted above, the full statement, as Sassaman recalled, was: “I really don’t have any choice. Michelle\n[Brant] knows a lot of attorneys; I’m afraid she’ll sue me. And besides you probably did what she said you did because\nyou’re male and nobody would believe you anyway.” J.A. 176.\n\n                                                             8\n\fdoes not, however, provide a basis for entry of judgment in [the defendant’s] favor as a matter of\n\nlaw.”).\n\n          Defendants also contend that Gamache’s fear of a lawsuit brought by Brant justified his\n\ndecision to pressure Sassaman to resign. They observe that “employers who disregard charges of sex-\n\nrelated misconduct by their employees run a considerable risk of being sanctioned for having tolerated\n\nsexual harassment.” Appellees’ Br. 15. We appreciate that employers who fail to address claims of\n\nsexual harassment expose themselves to civil liability. However, fear of a lawsuit does not justify an\n\nemployer’s reliance on sex stereotypes to resolve allegations of sexual harassment, discriminating\n\nagainst the accused employee in the process. To be sure, Title VII requires employers to take claims of\n\nsexual harassment seriously. See, e.g., Burlington Indus. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 764 (1998) (“Title VII is\n\ndesigned to encourage the creation of . . . effective grievance mechanisms.”). It also requires that, in\n\nthe course of investigating such claims, employers do not presume male employees to be “guilty until\n\nproven innocent” based on invidious sex stereotypes.\n\n          With respect to the District Court’s characterization of Gamache’s comment as “stray,” we\n\nreiterate our observation that “[t]he more a remark evinces a discriminatory state of mind, and the\n\ncloser the remark’s relation to the allegedly discriminatory behavior, the more probative that remark\n\nwill be.” Tomassi, 478 F.3d at 115. Here, it is reasonable to infer a discriminatory state of mind from\n\nGamache’s remark that men have a propensity to sexually harass women. In addition, Gamache made\n\nthis remark during the same telephone call in which he pressured Sassaman to resign—the allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory act. Gamache’s apparent reliance on the alleged propensity of men to engage in sexual\n\nharassment as a justification, in part, for his decision to credit Brant’s allegations of sexual harassment is\n\nquite the opposite of “stray.” Indeed, it tended to “show that the decision-maker was motivated by\n\nassumptions or attitudes relating to the protected class.” Id. at 116. Here, as in Tomassi, “[t]he remarks\n\n\n                                                       9\n\fwere made by the person who decided to terminate [the plaintiff]. They could reasonably be construed,\n\nfurthermore, as explaining why that decision was taken.” Id. From this evidence, a jury could\n\nreasonably construe Gamache’s statement as persuasive evidence that he pressured Sassaman to resign\n\nbecause of his discriminatory assumptions about the propensity of men to sexually harass their female\n\nco-workers.\n\n        The allegation that defendants made minimal—if any—efforts to verify Brant’s accusations\n\ncould be construed by a reasonable jury as further evidence that Sassaman’s forced resignation occurred\n\nunder circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent. Sassaman argues that,\n\nalthough Gamache referred the matter to local authorities for a criminal investigation, “Gamache\n\nconducted no investigation himself about the serious allegations made by Brant; he did not have his\n\nDeputy investigate; and he did not ask [the Equal Employment Opportunity Officer] to investigate.”\n\nAppellant’s Br. 9. Defendants respond that “courts are prohibited from acting as ‘super-personnel’\n\ndepartments [and] from questioning the reasonableness of an employer’s personnel and disciplinary\n\ndecisions [and] the methods by which they arrived at those decisions, in the absence of independent\n\nevidence that the process was tainted by [a] discriminatory motive.” Appellees’ Br. 29-30.\n\n        As a general matter, we agree with defendants that it is not the role of federal courts to review\n\nthe correctness of employment decisions or the processes by which those decisions are made. See, e.g.,\n\nByrnie v. Town of Cromwell Bd. of Educ., 243 F.3d 93, 103 (2d Cir. 2001) (“[A] court must respect [an]\n\nemployer’s unfettered discretion to choose among qualified candidates.” (quoting Fischbach v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia Dept. of Corr., 86 F.3d 1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1996))). Nevertheless, Title VII suits often require\n\na court or jury to consider whether an employer’s response to an allegation of discrimination itself\n\nconstitutes evidence of discrimination or liability for discrimination. When employees complain of\n\nTitle VII violations, for example, employers “can be held liable . . . if [they] d[o] not fulfill [their] duty\n\n\n                                                       10\n\fto take reasonable steps to remedy the [violation].” Torres v. Pisano, 116 F.3d 625, 638 (2d Cir. 1997); see\n\nalso Distasio v. Perkin Elmer Corp., 157 F.3d 55, 65 (2d Cir. 1998) (“An employer that has knowledge of a\n\nhostile work environment has a duty to take reasonable steps to remedy it.”). The failure of an\n\nemployer to conduct an adequate investigation or to undertake an appropriate response can constitute\n\nevidence in support of a Title VII plaintiff’s allegations. For that reason, we have observed that, in the\n\nTitle VII context, “an employer must consider not only the behavior of the alleged offender, but also\n\nthe response, if any, of its managers.” Malik v. Carrier Corp., 202 F.3d 97, 106 (2d Cir. 2000); see also id.\n\n(“[I]t goes without saying that an employer’s obligations in this regard do not cease because the alleged\n\nharasser denies inappropriate conduct.”). Likewise, when an employer considers how to respond to an\n\nemployee’s allegation of discrimination, it may take into account the risk that the complaining employee\n\nmight file an action against the employer. An employer may not, however, rely on its alleged fear of a\n\nlawsuit as a pretext for making an employment decision that violates Title VII.\n\n        Likewise, when an employer considers how to respond to an employee’s allegation of\n\ndiscrimination, it may take into account the risk that the complaining employee might file an action\n\nagainst the employer. Indeed, it is in part the threat of such action that helps ensure the rights Title VII\n\nwas enacted to protect. That said, an employer may not rely on an alleged fear of a lawsuit as a reason\n\nto shortcut its investigation of harassment and to justify an employment decision adverse to the\n\nputative harasser that in itself violates Title VII. Indeed, just as the lack of investigation of a reported\n\nclaim of harassment may factor into the determination of an employer’s liability for discrimination\n\nagainst the complainant, so too may it indicate discrimination by an employer whose adverse\n\ndetermination against the putative harasser otherwise bears indicia of prohibited discrimination.\n\nApplying these principles to the allegations contained in Sassaman’s complaint, a reasonable jury could\n\ninfer from the inadequacy of defendants’ investigation, if proven, that defendants relied solely on a sex\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fstereotype, and clearly not on the outcome of a reasonable investigation undertaken in response to their\n\nfear of a lawsuit, as the basis for the decision to pressure Sassaman to resign.\n\n        We emphasize that we do not hold that an arguably insufficient investigation of a complaint of\n\nsexual harassment leading to an adverse employment action against the accused is, standing alone,\n\nsufficient to support an inference of discriminatory intent. Rather, we hold only that where a plaintiff\n\ncan point to evidence closely tied to the adverse employment action that could reasonably be\n\ninterpreted as indicating that discrimination drove the decision, an arguably insufficient investigation\n\nmay support an inference of discriminatory intent.\n\n                                                   * * *\n\n        Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Sassaman, as we are required to do when\n\nconsidering an appeal from a grant of defendants’ motion for summary judgment, see, e.g., Terry v.\n\nAshcroft, 336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir. 2003), we conclude that this evidence—Gamache’s alleged\n\ncomment on the propensity of men to engage in sexual harassment and defendants’ arguable failure to\n\ninvestigate properly the charges of sexual harassment lodged against Sassaman—was sufficient to\n\npermit a jury to infer discriminatory intent. The District Court erred, therefore, in concluding that\n\nSassaman had failed to set forth a prima facie case of sex discrimination in violation of Title VII. We\n\nnevertheless affirm the dismissal of the complaint with respect to Gamache because “individuals are\n\nnot subject to liability under Title VII.” Patterson v. County of Oneida, 375 F.3d 206, 221 (2d Cir. 2004)\n\n(quoting Wrighten v. Glowski, 232 F.3d 119, 120 (2d Cir. 2000)).\n\n                                             CONCLUSION\n\n        For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court with respect\n\nto defendant-appellee Gamache only, VACATE the judgment with respect to the other defendants,\n\nand REMAND the action for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                                     12\n\f",

The District Court determined, on defendants’ motion for summary\n\njudgment, that plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination because he had not\n\nidentified evidence sufficient to support an inference of discrimination. We disagree. Plaintiff’s\n\nevidence included: (1) his supervisor’s statement indicating that men have a propensity to commit\n\nsexual harassment and (2) defendants’ arguable failure to investigate properly the charges of sexual\n\nharassment lodged against plaintiff. This evidence would permit a reasonable jury to infer\n\ndiscrimination based on sex stereotyping.

CABRANES, Circuit Judge:\n\n        In this Title VII action, plaintiff-appellant Carl Thomas Sassaman charges his former employer\n\nand supervisor—defendants-appellees David Gamache, Commissioner of the Dutchess County Board\n\nof Elections, the Dutchess County Board of Elections, and Dutchess County—with sex discrimination.\n\nSassaman alleges that defendants pressured him to resign because of a sex stereotype regarding the\n\npropensity of men to sexually harass their female co-workers. The United States District Court for the\n\nSouthern District of New York (Charles L. Brieant, Judge) granted defendants summary judgment on\n\nthe grounds that Sassaman had not identified evidence sufficient to support an inference of\n\ndiscrimination and therefore had failed to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination. On appeal,\n\nwe consider whether a reasonable jury could infer discrimination based on sex stereotyping in light of\n\nSassaman’s evidence that his supervisor believed that men have a propensity to commit sexual\n\nharassment and defendants’ arguable failure to investigate properly the charges of sexual harassment\n\nlodged against Sassaman. As explained in further detail below, we conclude that this evidence was\n\nsufficient to meet Sassaman’s minimal burden of establishing a prima facie case of sex discrimination in\n\nviolation of Title VII.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n        Unless otherwise indicated, the facts set forth in this section are drawn from the record of the\n\nproceedings before the District Court and are not contested by the parties.\n\n\n                                                    2\n\f       In early 2003, plaintiff-appellant Carl Thomas Sassaman joined the staff of the Dutchess\n\nCounty Board of Elections (the “Board”) as an Elections Administrator, working under defendant-\n\nappellee David Gamache, the Republican Commissioner of the Board. Due to a printing error in\n\nOctober 2004, that year’s election ballots had to be reprinted, and Sassaman was “assigned to oversee[ ]\n\nthe budget issue regarding” this unanticipated expense. J.A. 24, 59-60. After it was determined that\n\nreprinting the ballots would require the allocation of an additional $16,000 to the Board’s budget,\n\nCommissioner Gamache met with state legislators to request the funds. Gamache felt humiliated and\n\nembarrassed by the experience, and he appears to have blamed Sassaman for putting him in the\n\nposition of requesting additional funds from the legislature. After communicating his dissatisfaction to\n\nSassaman, Gamache announced that he was demoting Sassaman to Elections Specialist, effective\n\nJanuary 1, 2005. Gamache filled Sassaman’s position, Elections Administrator, with Michelle Brant,\n\nthen an Elections Specialist. In effect, Sassaman and Brant traded positions at the Board.\n\n       Sassaman suspected that a romantic relationship between Brant and Gamache played a part in\n\nhis demotion and Brant’s promotion. According to Sassaman’s deposition testimony, he confronted\n\nBrant over the telephone on December 19, 2004, and revealed his suspicions. Brant allegedly denied\n\nany romantic involvement with Gamache, and Sassaman claims that he sent Brant a note of apology.\n\n       Prior to their reversal of job positions, Sassaman and Brant enjoyed a friendly working\n\nrelationship, marked by eating lunches and smoking cigarettes together. Their relationship soured in\n\nlate January 2005, almost a month after Sassaman’s demotion and Brant’s promotion had taken effect.\n\nA telephone call placed by Sassaman to Brant on Saturday, January 29, 2008 appears to have been the\n\nturning point in their relationship. In that call, Sassaman asked Brant whether she would like to meet\n\nhim out for a drink. When she declined, he suggested that they meet for coffee instead, but she\n\ndeclined that offer as well. Sassaman contends that Brant revealed intimate aspects of her personal life\n\n\n                                                    3\n\fto him during that telephone conversation and tried to ascertain whether he would be interested in\n\nengaging in a one-time sexual encounter. In light of these alleged revelations, Sassaman testified that he\n\ndecided that “[he] was not going to remain friends with her anymore.” Id. at 134. Shortly thereafter,\n\nBrant, who apparently had a different understanding of their telephone conversation, responded to\n\nSassaman’s changed demeanor by asking him whether he was “going to let [their] friendship go down\n\nthe tubes” because she did not want to have sex with him. Id. at 25, 60-61. The parties dispute\n\nwhether Sassaman responded that he did not have any interest in having sex with Brant.\n\n         In early March 2005, Sassaman noticed, looking over Brant’s shoulder at her computer screen,\n\nthat Brant had typed his name in an e-mail. The following day, Sassaman logged into Brant’s computer,\n\ngained access to her e-mail account, and read the e-mail that he had observed her typing the day\n\nbefore.1 Brant later discovered that her e-mail account had been breached and reported the conduct to\n\nGamache. Gamache and Deputy Commissioner John Kennedy summoned Sassaman to discuss the\n\nincident and Sassaman admitted that he was the one to enter Brant’s e-mail account. The parties\n\ndispute whether Gamache and Kennedy warned Sassaman that such conduct could not continue.\n\n         Within days, Gamache called another meeting with Sassaman to inform him that Brant had\n\ncomplained of Sassaman’s “harassing and stalking her.” Id. at 26, 61. Gamache told Sassaman that\n\nBrant claimed to fear Sassaman and had stayed out of the office for that reason. Sassaman was\n\nsuspended from work with pay. On March 10, 2005, Brant submitted a written complaint describing\n\nSassaman’s conduct, and Gamache referred her complaint to the Dutchess County Sheriff’s Office for\n\ninvestigation. He did not refer the matter for an internal investigation. Officers from the Sheriff’s\n\nOffice interviewed Brant and Sassaman. During his interview, Sassaman denied ever calling Brant at\n\n\n\n         1\n           Sassaman contends that his actions were not unprecedented because he had previously gained access to\nBrant’s e-mail account when she was absent from the office and he was “assigned to her desk.” J.A. 61.\n\n                                                            4\n\fhome or sending her notes. When pressed further, Sassaman admitted that he had both called Brant at\n\nhome and sent her at least one note. Sassaman attributes the discrepancy between his initial responses\n\nand subsequent admissions to his belief that “he was being interviewed about sexual harassment and he\n\nnever called or wrote a note that could reasonably be considered sexually harassing.” Id. at 62-63.\n\nUpon completing its investigation, the Sheriff’s Office concluded, in a report dated March 16, 2005,\n\n“At this time insufficient evidence exists to support any type of criminal charges.” Id. at 51.\n\n        While the matter was being investigated by the Sheriff’s Office, Sassaman met with Gamache\n\ntwice. According to Sassaman, these meeting were brief and held at a local diner. Shortly thereafter,\n\nSassaman retained counsel, who then participated in two more meetings with Gamache.\n\n        On March 21, 2005, Gamache informed Sassaman by telephone that he would be terminated\n\nunless he chose to resign. According to Sassaman’s deposition testimony, Gamache defended his\n\ndecision by explaining, “I really don’t have any choice. Michelle [Brant] knows a lot of attorneys; I’m\n\nafraid she’ll sue me. And besides you probably did what she said you did because you’re male and\n\nnobody would believe you anyway.” J.A. 176. In response, Sassaman resigned effective April 1, 2005.\n\n        After exhausting his administrative remedies, Sassaman brought this action in the District\n\nCourt, alleging that defendant-appellees Gamache, the Dutchess County Board of Elections, and\n\nDutchess County terminated him on the basis of sex stereotyping in violation of Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).2 The parties conducted discovery, and, upon the completion of\n\n\n\n        2\n            Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a),\n\n        It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\n        individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n        conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n        origin; or (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would\n        deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status\n        as an employee, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n\n\n                                                             5\n\fdiscovery, defendants moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure. In an oral decision, the District Court granted defendants’ motion, determining that\n\nSassaman failed to identify “evidence which would permit a rational fact finder to find an inference of\n\ndiscrimination based on sex.” Tr. 13. With respect to the statement of Gamache to Sassaman that\n\n“you probably did what she said you did because you’re male,” the District Court “[did not] attach any\n\nreal significance to that statement, assuming it was made.” Id. at 12. The District Court discounted the\n\ncomments attributed to Gamache as “stray” and “ambigu[ous]” and incapable of “demonstrat[ing]\n\nactionable gender stereotyping,” and reasoned that “such a viewpoint, even if held, would [not]\n\nnecessarily taint an employment decision to respond to a harassment complaint.” Id. at 12-13. For\n\nthese reasons, the District Court concluded that Sassaman had failed to establish a prima facie case of sex\n\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII and granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Id. at\n\n13-15.\n\n         This appeal followed.\n\n                                              DISCUSSION\n\n         On appeal, Sassaman challenges the District Court’s determination that he failed to present a\n\nprima facie case of sex discrimination in violation of Title VII. We review de novo the District Court’s\n\ndecision to grant summary judgment in favor of defendants, and, in the course of that review, we draw\n\nall permissible factual inferences in favor of Sassaman, the non-moving party. See, e.g., Holcomb v. Iona\n\nCollege, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1302107\"><a href=\"/opinion/1302107/holcomb-v-iona-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 137 (2d Cir. 2008). To establish a prima facie Title VII case, a plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate that “(1) that he belonged to a protected class; (2) that he was qualified for the position he\n\nheld; (3) that he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that the adverse employment action\n\noccurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.” Id. at 138. The\n\nSupreme Court has used the adjective “minimal” to describe the burden of establishing a prima facie case\n\n\n                                                      6\n\fof discrimination in violation of Title VII, St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v.

Delta Air Lines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771985\"><a href=\"/opinion/771985/mark-abdu-brisson-ronald-h-buchner-gordon-burgess-robert-burke-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n        For the purposes of their motion for summary judgment, defendants assume that Sassaman has\n\nestablished the first three elements of a prima facie case, but they dispute whether Sassaman has\n\nestablished the fourth element—namely, that the circumstances gave rise to an inference of\n\ndiscriminatory intent. Under our precedent, an inference of discriminatory intent may be established\n\nby, inter alia, “the employer’s . . . invidious comments about others in the employee’s protected group;\n\nor . . . the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff’s discharge.” Id. at 468 (quoting Chambers v. TRM\n\nCopy Ctrs. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685132\"><a href=\"/opinion/685132/66-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1133-65-empl-prac-dec-p-43404-lorenzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37 (2d Cir. 1994). Sassaman argues that he met this burden by producing\n\nevidence showing that (1) his supervisor, Gamache, made what could be construed as an invidious\n\ncomment about the propensity of men to harass sexually their female colleagues; and (2) defendants\n\nfailed to investigate properly the charges of sexual harassment lodged against Sassaman—charges that\n\nled directly to his forced resignation. Defendants respond that Gamache’s comment on the propensity\n\nof men to engage in sexual harassment was nothing more than a “mere stray remark,” and their\n\ninvestigation of the allegations against Sassaman was not tainted by any bias. Appellees’ Br. 13, 32.\n\n        Considering first Sassaman’s testimony that Gamache told him, “you probably did what [Brant]\n\nsaid you did because you’re male,” J.A. 176, we agree with Sassaman that a reasonable jury could\n\nconstrue this statement as an invidious sex stereotype. As the Supreme Court explained in Price\n\nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, “we are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming\n\nor insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251 (1989)\n\n(superceded by statute on other grounds). In that case, the Supreme Court “discern[ed] sex\n\nstereotyping in a description of an aggressive female employee as requiring ‘a course at charm school,’”\n\n\n                                                       7\n\fand it observed that “if an employee’s flawed ‘interpersonal skills’ can be corrected by a soft-hued suit\n\nor a new shade of lipstick, perhaps it is the employee’s sex and not her interpersonal skills that has\n\ndrawn the criticism.” Id. at 256. Construing the facts at issue in the light most favorable to Sassaman,\n\nas we must under controlling authority, the alleged sex stereotyping is more overt: Gamache appears to\n\nhave defended his decision to credit Brant’s allegations of sexual harassment by pointing to the\n\npropensity of men, as a group, to sexually harass women. When employment decisions are based on\n\ninvidious sex stereotypes, a reasonable jury could infer the existence of discriminatory intent. See, e.g.,\n\nBack v. Hastings on Hudson Union Free Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785851\"><a href=\"/opinion/785851/elana-back-v-hastings-on-hudson-union-free-school-district-john-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 120 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that comments\n\nmade about a woman’s inability to combine work and motherhood constitute sex stereotyping that\n\nprovides evidence of discriminatory intent).\n\n         Defendants dispute Sassaman’s interpretation of Gamache’s remarks. They argue that the\n\nstatement, in context,3 was “something of an aside after the termination decision had been made, and\n\nwas not an expression of the reason for [Sassaman’s] termination, but rather an opinion as to what\n\nothers may think.” Appellees’ Br. 15. Whether Sassaman’s interpretation or that of defendants best\n\ncaptures the meaning of Gamache’s statement is not properly decided by this Court, or by the District\n\nCourt, on a motion for summary judgment. Insofar as the comment might be ambiguous, it is “our\n\nobligation at this stage to interpret ambiguities in the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff.” Tomassi v. Insignia Financial Group, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796950\"><a href=\"/opinion/796950/patricia-mccarthy-tomassi-v-insignia-financial-group-inc-and-insignia/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116 (2d Cir. 2007). The choice between\n\nplausible interpretations of Gamache’s remarks is a question of fact to be resolved by a jury. See, e.g.,\n\nCronin v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687594\"><a href=\"/opinion/687594/james-m-cronin-v-aetna-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206 (2d Cir. 1995) (“[The defendant’s] characterization [of a\n\nletter] might, if proffered through sworn testimony, raise questions of fact to be resolved at trial. It\n\n\n         3\n          As noted above, the full statement, as Sassaman recalled, was: “I really don’t have any choice. Michelle\n[Brant] knows a lot of attorneys; I’m afraid she’ll sue me. And besides you probably did what she said you did because\nyou’re male and nobody would believe you anyway.” J.A. 176.\n\n                                                             8\n\fdoes not, however, provide a basis for entry of judgment in [the defendant’s] favor as a matter of\n\nlaw.”).\n\n          Defendants also contend that Gamache’s fear of a lawsuit brought by Brant justified his\n\ndecision to pressure Sassaman to resign. They observe that “employers who disregard charges of sex-\n\nrelated misconduct by their employees run a considerable risk of being sanctioned for having tolerated\n\nsexual harassment.” Appellees’ Br. 15. We appreciate that employers who fail to address claims of\n\nsexual harassment expose themselves to civil liability. However, fear of a lawsuit does not justify an\n\nemployer’s reliance on sex stereotypes to resolve allegations of sexual harassment, discriminating\n\nagainst the accused employee in the process. To be sure, Title VII requires employers to take claims of\n\nsexual harassment seriously. See, e.g., Burlington Indus. v. Ellerth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118244\"><a href=\"/opinion/118244/burlington-industries-inc-v-ellerth/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (1998) (“Title VII is\n\ndesigned to encourage the creation of . . . effective grievance mechanisms.”). It also requires that, in\n\nthe course of investigating such claims, employers do not presume male employees to be “guilty until\n\nproven innocent” based on invidious sex stereotypes.\n\n          With respect to the District Court’s characterization of Gamache’s comment as “stray,” we\n\nreiterate our observation that “[t]he more a remark evinces a discriminatory state of mind, and the\n\ncloser the remark’s relation to the allegedly discriminatory behavior, the more probative that remark\n\nwill be.” Tomassi, 478 F.3d at 115. Here, it is reasonable to infer a discriminatory state of mind from\n\nGamache’s remark that men have a propensity to sexually harass women. In addition, Gamache made\n\nthis remark during the same telephone call in which he pressured Sassaman to resign—the allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory act. Gamache’s apparent reliance on the alleged propensity of men to engage in sexual\n\nharassment as a justification, in part, for his decision to credit Brant’s allegations of sexual harassment is\n\nquite the opposite of “stray.” Indeed, it tended to “show that the decision-maker was motivated by\n\nassumptions or attitudes relating to the protected class.” Id. at 116. Here, as in Tomassi, “[t]he remarks\n\n\n                                                       9\n\fwere made by the person who decided to terminate [the plaintiff]. They could reasonably be construed,\n\nfurthermore, as explaining why that decision was taken.” Id. From this evidence, a jury could\n\nreasonably construe Gamache’s statement as persuasive evidence that he pressured Sassaman to resign\n\nbecause of his discriminatory assumptions about the propensity of men to sexually harass their female\n\nco-workers.\n\n        The allegation that defendants made minimal—if any—efforts to verify Brant’s accusations\n\ncould be construed by a reasonable jury as further evidence that Sassaman’s forced resignation occurred\n\nunder circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent. Sassaman argues that,\n\nalthough Gamache referred the matter to local authorities for a criminal investigation, “Gamache\n\nconducted no investigation himself about the serious allegations made by Brant; he did not have his\n\nDeputy investigate; and he did not ask [the Equal Employment Opportunity Officer] to investigate.”\n\nAppellant’s Br. 9. Defendants respond that “courts are prohibited from acting as ‘super-personnel’\n\ndepartments [and] from questioning the reasonableness of an employer’s personnel and disciplinary\n\ndecisions [and] the methods by which they arrived at those decisions, in the absence of independent\n\nevidence that the process was tainted by [a] discriminatory motive.” Appellees’ Br. 29-30.\n\n        As a general matter, we agree with defendants that it is not the role of federal courts to review\n\nthe correctness of employment decisions or the processes by which those decisions are made. See, e.g.,\n\nByrnie v. Town of Cromwell Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772432\"><a href=\"/opinion/772432/robert-f-byrnie-v-town-of-cromwell-board-of-education-body-corporate/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (2d Cir. 2001) (“[A] court must respect [an]\n\nemployer’s unfettered discretion to choose among qualified candidates.” (quoting Fischbach v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia Dept. of Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720519\"><a href=\"/opinion/720519/ronald-j-fischbach-v-district-of-columbia-department-of-corrections-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1996))). Nevertheless, Title VII suits often require\n\na court or jury to consider whether an employer’s response to an allegation of discrimination itself\n\nconstitutes evidence of discrimination or liability for discrimination. When employees complain of\n\nTitle VII violations, for example, employers “can be held liable . . . if [they] d[o] not fulfill [their] duty\n\n\n                                                       10\n\fto take reasonable steps to remedy the [violation].” Torres v. Pisano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742597\"><a href=\"/opinion/742597/jenice-torres-v-leonard-pisano-individually-and-as-associate-director-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638 (2d Cir. 1997); see\n\nalso Distasio v. Perkin Elmer Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758319\"><a href=\"/opinion/758319/marianna-distasio-v-perkin-elmer-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (2d Cir. 1998) (“An employer that has knowledge of a\n\nhostile work environment has a duty to take reasonable steps to remedy it.”). The failure of an\n\nemployer to conduct an adequate investigation or to undertake an appropriate response can constitute\n\nevidence in support of a Title VII plaintiff’s allegations. For that reason, we have observed that, in the\n\nTitle VII context, “an employer must consider not only the behavior of the alleged offender, but also\n\nthe response, if any, of its managers.” Malik v. Carrier Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767462\"><a href=\"/opinion/767462/rajiv-malik-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-carrier-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106 (2d Cir. 2000); see also id.\n\n(“[I]t goes without saying that an employer’s obligations in this regard do not cease because the alleged\n\nharasser denies inappropriate conduct.”). Likewise, when an employer considers how to respond to an\n\nemployee’s allegation of discrimination, it may take into account the risk that the complaining employee\n\nmight file an action against the employer. An employer may not, however, rely on its alleged fear of a\n\nlawsuit as a pretext for making an employment decision that violates Title VII.\n\n        Likewise, when an employer considers how to respond to an employee’s allegation of\n\ndiscrimination, it may take into account the risk that the complaining employee might file an action\n\nagainst the employer. Indeed, it is in part the threat of such action that helps ensure the rights Title VII\n\nwas enacted to protect. That said, an employer may not rely on an alleged fear of a lawsuit as a reason\n\nto shortcut its investigation of harassment and to justify an employment decision adverse to the\n\nputative harasser that in itself violates Title VII. Indeed, just as the lack of investigation of a reported\n\nclaim of harassment may factor into the determination of an employer’s liability for discrimination\n\nagainst the complainant, so too may it indicate discrimination by an employer whose adverse\n\ndetermination against the putative harasser otherwise bears indicia of prohibited discrimination.\n\nApplying these principles to the allegations contained in Sassaman’s complaint, a reasonable jury could\n\ninfer from the inadequacy of defendants’ investigation, if proven, that defendants relied solely on a sex\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fstereotype, and clearly not on the outcome of a reasonable investigation undertaken in response to their\n\nfear of a lawsuit, as the basis for the decision to pressure Sassaman to resign.\n\n        We emphasize that we do not hold that an arguably insufficient investigation of a complaint of\n\nsexual harassment leading to an adverse employment action against the accused is, standing alone,\n\nsufficient to support an inference of discriminatory intent. Rather, we hold only that where a plaintiff\n\ncan point to evidence closely tied to the adverse employment action that could reasonably be\n\ninterpreted as indicating that discrimination drove the decision, an arguably insufficient investigation\n\nmay support an inference of discriminatory intent.\n\n                                                   * * *\n\n        Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Sassaman, as we are required to do when\n\nconsidering an appeal from a grant of defendants’ motion for summary judgment, see, e.g., Terry v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782711\"><a href=\"/opinion/782711/andrew-terry-v-john-ashcroft-1-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 137 (2d Cir. 2003), we conclude that this evidence—Gamache’s alleged\n\ncomment on the propensity of men to engage in sexual harassment and defendants’ arguable failure to\n\ninvestigate properly the charges of sexual harassment lodged against Sassaman—was sufficient to\n\npermit a jury to infer discriminatory intent. The District Court erred, therefore, in concluding that\n\nSassaman had failed to set forth a prima facie case of sex discrimination in violation of Title VII. We\n\nnevertheless affirm the dismissal of the complaint with respect to Gamache because “individuals are\n\nnot subject to liability under Title VII.” Patterson v. County of Oneida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786894\"><a href=\"/opinion/786894/michael-antonio-patterson-v-county-of-oneida-new-york-oneida-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221 (2d Cir. 2004)\n\n(quoting Wrighten v.
