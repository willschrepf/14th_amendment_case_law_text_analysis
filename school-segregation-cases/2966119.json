App. P. 47.4.\n\f                                   Background Facts\n\n      Father and J.M.R. (Mother) divorced on October 3, 2000. The only child of\n\nthe marriage was W.M.R., who was nine years old. The final divorce decree\n\nstated:\n\n            The court finds that [W.M.R.] suffers from muscular dystrophy\n      and will be incapable of being self supporting after the age of\n      eighteen.\n\n            IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that [Father] is obligated to\n      pay and, shall pay to [Mother] child support of $1500.00 per month\n      for [W.M.R.] in monthly installments . . . until the date of the earliest\n      occurrence of one of the following events:\n\n             a. the child dies;\n\n             b. further order modifying this child support;\n\n           c. $1,000 monthly payments are commenced to [W.M.R.]\n      pursuant to New York Life Insurance Company annuity policy.\n\n            Upon the commencement of the $1,000.00 monthly annuity\n      payments set forth in paragraph c above[,] the support obligation of\n      [Father] shall be reduced to $500.00 per month . . . and continuing\n      thereafter until the first of the contingencies set forth in paragraph a\n      and b above occurs.\n\nFather’s employer was ordered to withhold child support from Father’s earnings.\n\n“Earnings” was defined as “compensation paid or payable to [Father] for personal\n\nservices, whether called wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise.”\n\nFather was also required to provide and maintain medical insurance coverage for\n\nW.M.R. and to pay for fifty percent of all health care expenses not covered by\n\ninsurance.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f      On August 16, 2001, the trial court modified the child support provisions of\n\nthe divorce decree. The 2001 order states,\n\n      The prior Order of this Court entitled DECREE OF DIVORCE[,]\n      which was signed by the Court on October 3, 2000[,] is hereby\n      modified as follows:\n\n      . . . [Father] shall pay to [Mother] child support of $870.75 each\n      month . . . until the first month following the date of the earliest\n      occurrence of one of the events specified below:\n\n            (1) the child dies;\n\n            (2) further order modifying this child support;\n\n            (3) $1,000.00 monthly payments are commenced to [W.M.R.]\n            pursuant to New York Life Ins. Co. annuity policy.\n\n      Upon the commencement of the $1,000.00 monthly annuity\n      payments set forth above the support obligation of [Father] shall be\n      reduced by such sum commencing the first day of the first month\n      following the commencement of the annuity payments.\n\nThe order also stated that Father should pay 20% “of the net after taxes of any\n\nbonus he receives from his employment,” and required Father to deliver to\n\nMother a copy of the bonus check.\n\n      The new order did not change Father’s duties regarding medical insurance\n\nor uncovered medical expenses.\n\n      When W.M.R. turned eighteen in October, 2008, Father stopped paying\n\nchild support. On September 22, 2010, Mother filed a “Petition to Enforce Child\n\nSupport Order and to Modify Parent-Child Relationship.” Mother alleged that\n\nFather failed to pay any child support from his employment bonuses, and\n\nbecause of W.M.R.’s disability, she asked the court to modify the child support\n\n\n                                         3\n\forder to extend child support payments “for an indefinite period” and to require\n\nFather to pay, “as additional support, a portion of the uninsured expenses for\n\nmedical supplies, equipment, in-home care, over-the-counter medications, and\n\nother related expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance on the wheelchair-\n\nequipped van and replacement costs, if necessary.” She sought an arrearage for\n\nthe unpaid child support since W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday. Father responded\n\nto Mother’s motion, arguing that the order was incapable of enforcement because\n\nit is ambiguous, and that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the case.\n\n      After a hearing, the trial court entered an order on July 7, 2011, finding that\n\nFather owed Mother $38,158.73 in unpaid child support. The trial court ordered\n\nFather to pay the arrearage plus $1,465.50 a month for W.M.R.’s needs, fifty\n\npercent of W.M.R.’s medical expenses, and fifty percent of “all expenses to\n\nreplace the wheel-chair equipped van.” Father then filed this appeal.\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n1. Jurisdiction\n\n      In Father’s first three issues, he challenges the trial court’s jurisdiction to\n\nmake the 2011 modification. A court acquires continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in\n\nsuits affecting the parent-child relationship by the rendition of a final order. Tex.\n\nFam. Code Ann. § 155.001(a) (West 2008). The court retains its jurisdiction until\n\n(1) an order of adoption is rendered; (2) the parents have remarried each other;\n\nor (3) another court assumes jurisdiction by rendering a final order based on\n\nincorrect information that there was no court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                          4\n\fId. §§ 155.002, 155.004(a) (West 2008).        A court with continuing, exclusive\n\njurisdiction may modify its prior order regarding child support.      Id. § 155.003\n\n(West 2008). A suit for support for a minor or adult disabled child may be filed in\n\nthe court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction as a suit for a modification.     Id.\n\n§ 154.305(c) (West 2008).\n\n      In this case, the court acquired jurisdiction in 2000 with the rendition of the\n\nfinal divorce decree. Father argues that his child support obligation ended when\n\nW.M.R. turned eighteen for two reasons.         First, he argues that the annuity\n\npayment “zeroed out” his child support obligation, thereby ending it. The 2001\n\norder states that once the annuity payments commenced, Father’s obligation\n\n“shall be reduced by” the amount of the annuity payments. Because Father’s\n\nobligation was for less than the amount of the annuity payments, Father argues\n\nhis obligation ended when the annuity payment began.            Father’s argument\n\nignores the language of the 2001 order which states that Father’s obligation\n\ncontinues until W.M.R.’s death or further order by the trial court.             The\n\ncommencement of the annuity payments does not extinguish Father’s obligation,\n\nit merely reduces it.\n\n      Second, Father argues that the trial court did not make the required\n\nfindings to continue child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday. Section\n\n154.302 of the family code states:\n\n      (a) The court may order either or both parents to provide for the\n      support of a child for an indefinite period and may determine the\n      rights and duties of the parents if the court finds that:\n\n\n                                         5\n\f            (1) the child, whether institutionalized or not, requires\n            substantial care and personal supervision because of a mental\n            or physical disability and will not be capable of self-support;\n            and\n\n            (2) the disability exists, or the cause of the disability is known\n            to exist, on or before the 18th birthday of the child.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.302 (West 2008). Thus, the court cannot order\n\ncontinued child support unless it finds that the child requires substantial care and\n\npersonal supervision and will not be capable of self-support. See id. Father\n\nargues first that the 2001 agreed order “completely superseded all prior orders\n\nregarding child support.”     Because the agreed order contains no findings\n\nregarding W.M.R.’s disability, he continues, it is insufficient to support the trial\n\ncourt’s order of support.   Second, he argues that the findings in the original\n\ndivorce decree that W.M.R. “suffers from muscular dystrophy and will be\n\nincapable of being self[-]supporting after the age of eighteen” are insufficient\n\nunder the statute.    Father also argues that we may not imply the findings\n\nnecessary to support the judgment.\n\n      In support of Father’s argument that the agreed order “completely\n\nsuperseded” the divorce decree, he cites In re Clark for the proposition that “[a]n\n\norder modifying a prior child custody or support order necessarily supersedes the\n\nprior order . . . . Thus, an order modifying a prior child support order may . . .\n\n‘terminate’ the obligation imposed by the prior order . . . .” No. 10-03-00037-CV,\n\n2004 WL 1632768, at *5 (Tex. App.—Waco July 21, 2004, no pet.). Father’s use\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fof ellipses contorts the original statement.       Clark actually says “An order\n\nmodifying a prior child custody or support order necessarily supercedes the prior\n\norder to the extent a modification is ordered. Thus, an order modifying a prior\n\nchild support order may or may not ‘terminate’ the obligation imposed by the prior\n\norder, depending on the circumstances.” Id. (emphasis added); see also Office\n\nof Attorney Gen. of Tex. v. Wilson, 24 S.W.3d 902, 906 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2000,\n\nno pet.) (holding that a modification order that changed the identity of the payee\n\nof child support and did not change any other terms of paying child support left\n\nthose unaddressed terms “unchanged” and that the two orders read together\n\n“specifically and unambiguously state the terms of Wilson’s child support\n\nobligation”). The only change to Father’s child support obligations was a\n\nreduction of his monthly payments from $1,500 to $870.75. The 2001 agreed\n\norder made no modification to the findings that W.M.R. suffers from muscular\n\ndystrophy and will be incapable of supporting himself after the age of eighteen.\n\nThus, those findings remain even after the changes imposed by the agreed\n\norder.\n\n         Turning to whether the trial court’s findings are sufficient to support an\n\norder of child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday, we note that the\n\nstatute requires the trial court to find that W.M.R. (1) requires substantial care\n\nand personal supervision because of a mental or physical disability and (2) will\n\nnot be capable of self-support. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.302(a)(1) (West\n\n2008).     The divorce decree includes the finding that W.M.R. would not be\n\n\n                                          7\n\fcapable of self-support but does not explicitly state that W.M.R. requires\n\nsubstantial care and personal supervision. Father argues that the finding that\n\nW.M.R. requires substantial care and personal supervision must be stated in the\n\norder and that we cannot imply the finding.\n\n      Father did not request findings pursuant to rule 296 or rule 298 of the rules\n\nof civil procedure, and there were no separately entered findings of fact or\n\nconclusions of law after the divorce decree or any of the modification orders.\n\nSee Tex. R. Civ. P. 296, 298. Father acknowledged in his brief that while a trial\n\ncourt’s findings should not be recited in a judgment, when they are, they are\n\ngiven “probative value.” See Tex. R. Civ. P. 299a; Gonzalez v. Razi, 338 S.W.3d\n\n167, 175 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, pet. denied.); Hill v. Hill, 971\n\nS.W.2d 153, 157 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1998, no pet.).\n\n      Father argues that rule 299 of the rules of civil procedure prohibit us from\n\nimplying a finding by the trial court that W.M.R. requires substantial care and\n\npersonal supervision.    Father argues that “when the Court makes express\n\nfindings in support of its judgment, it is improper to imply other findings\n\nnecessary to support the judgment.” However, the cases Father cites in support\n\ndo not stand for this proposition. See In re C.A.B., 289 S.W.3d 874, 881 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.); E. F. Hutton & Co., v. Fox, 518\n\nS.W.2d 849, 856 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1974, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\nAll of these cases reference rule 299, which states,\n\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\f            The judgment may not be supported upon appeal by a\n      presumed finding upon any ground of recovery or defense, no\n      element of which has been included in the findings of fact; but when\n      one or more elements thereof have been found by the trial court,\n      omitted unrequested elements, when supported by evidence, will be\n      supplied by presumption in support of the judgment.\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 299. The cases that Father cites all involve a ground of recovery\n\nor defense in which no elements were found by the trial court. See C.A.B., 289\n\nS.W.3d at 881 (holding that it could not imply termination on one ground when no\n\nfindings were made on that ground and termination was expressly granted on\n\nanother ground); E.F. Hutton, 518 S.W.2d at 856 (noting that the issue was\n\n“whether the court has made findings of any elements of contract or promissory\n\nestoppel, so that ‘omitted unrequested elements’ may be supported by\n\npresumption under the provisions of Rule 299”, and holding that none of the trial\n\ncourt’s findings established “any element of either of these grounds of recovery”).\n\n      In this case, the trial court found that W.M.R. will not be capable of self-\n\nsupport after the age of eighteen.     Inability to self-support is one of the two\n\nelements needed to support child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday.\n\nTherefore, the omitted element of requiring substantial care and personal\n\nsupervision may, under rule 299, be supplied by presumption if it is supported by\n\nthe evidence. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 299.\n\n      Although we do not have the record of the original divorce hearing, Father\n\ndoes not contend that W.M.R.’s health has improved since that time, and the\n\nevidence at the last hearing supports the implied finding that W.M.R. continues to\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\frequire substantial care and personal supervision. As stated in the final divorce\n\ndecree, W.M.R. has muscular dystrophy. Mother testified that W.M.R.’s disease\n\nis “incurable, and it is progressive,” and that people with muscular dystrophy\n\n“eventually die because of heart and lung failure. But before that happens, they\n\nare essentially paralyzed because their muscles have completely broken down.”\n\nW.M.R.’s heart and lungs are impaired and he cannot lift his arms.          Mother\n\ntestified that she goes home every day at lunch to check on W.M.R. and that she\n\nhas to leave work unexpectedly “usually once or twice a week” to help him with\n\nsomething he needs. She testified that she has to take him to the doctor and\n\npick up his medications. Mother testified that W.M.R. “is not able to feed or dress\n\nhimself or get himself a drink or go to the toilet alone or bathe himself or any of\n\nthose things.” Every morning, Mother dresses W.M.R., washes his face, brushes\n\nhis teeth, shaves him, and gets him into his wheelchair. She testified that it takes\n\nher about an hour and a half to get him ready for bed, because she has to bathe\n\nhim, take care of his toiletries, give him his medications and breathing therapy,\n\nand get him into bed. Mother wakes up every two hours to roll W.M.R. over.\n\nShe testified that W.M.R. can only be alone for about four hours before he needs\n\nassistance. Mother has to get someone to stay with him when she is away.\n\n      Although W.M.R. does not need constant supervision, the testimony at the\n\nhearing was sufficient to support a finding that he requires substantial care and\n\nfrequent personal supervision. Thus, because the evidence supports the omitted\n\nelement that W.M.R. requires substantial care and personal supervision, we may\n\n\n                                        10\n\fsupply that element under rule 299. Thus, the trial court’s findings are sufficient\n\nto support an order of child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday. We\n\noverrule Father’s first, second, and third issues.\n\n2. Bonus\n\n      In Father’s fourth and fifth issues, he argues that the trial court erred in\n\ncalculating Father’s arrearage to include commissions he earned.        The 2011\n\norder included a finding that Father failed to pay $38,158.73 in child support.\n\nBecause the annuity payments covered all of Father’s child support obligation\n\nafter W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday, this amount could only be based on that part\n\nof the 2001 order which ordered additional child support in “a sum equal to 20%\n\nof the net after taxes of any bonus [Father] receive[d] from his employment.”2\n\nMother argues that the term “bonus” includes payments Father received that\n\nwere labeled by his employer as commissions.3\n\n      The 2001 modification order requires Father to pay 20% “of the net after\n\ntaxes of any bonus he receives from his employment,” and required Father to\n\ndeliver to Mother a copy of the bonus check. The modification order was an\n\nagreed judgment, and as such, should be construed in the same manner as a\n\ncontract. Gulf Ins. Co. v. Burns Motors, Inc., 22 S.W.3d 417, 422 (Tex. 2000). If\n\n      2\n       Mother does not dispute that the arrearage was calculated by including\nFather’s commissions.\n      3\n        Mother testified at the hearing that she was asking the trial court to find\nthat “the terms bonus and commission are the same for the purposes of [the\n2001 modification] order.”\n\n\n                                         11\n\fthe modification order is so worded that it can be given a certain or definite legal\n\nmeaning or interpretation, then it is not ambiguous and the court will construe the\n\ncontract as a matter of law. See Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.\n\n1983).\n\n      Father testified that he was paid bonuses from previous employers, but he\n\nhas not received any bonuses with his current employer. At the time of the 2001\n\nmodification, he received bonuses based upon certain criteria such as “[s]ales\n\nvolume, management objectives, [and] strategic objectives.” He claims that he\n\nmade his salary plus bonuses but did not receive commissions.\n\n      In 2004, Father accepted his current position. In his current job, Father\n\nreceives a base salary plus commission which is based “[s]trictly [on] sales\n\nvolume.”    He testified that his “regular pay” is his base salary plus the\n\ncommissions he receives. He also testified that his understanding of the word\n\nbonus as used in the order is “a recognized achievement of a particular goal.”\n\n      Mother testified that during their marriage, Father received his base salary\n\nplus bonuses that he received “several times throughout the year.”           At the\n\nhearing, she referred to the commissions that he received in his current job as\n\nbonuses because “[t]hat’s how he’s always described it to me.” Mother argues\n\nthat her testimony regarding the parties’ understanding of the term “bonus”\n\ndemonstrates that they both understood the term in the 2001 modification order\n\nto include commissions. However, Father testified that his payment in his current\n\nposition is structured differently than it was in his previous positions. Mother did\n\n\n                                        12\n\fnot testify that after changing jobs to his current position that he continued to\n\nrefer to “bonuses” that he received. Mother’s testimony only demonstrates her\n\nunderstanding of bonuses in Father’s previous payment structures, which were\n\nstructured as salary plus bonuses “throughout the year.”         Father’s current\n\npayment structure is salary plus commissions that were included in his regular\n\nwage checks. The 2001 modification order stated that Father was “ordered to\n\ndeliver to [Mother] within ten days of his receipt of any bonus check a copy of\n\nsuch check.” The order did not state that Father was to deliver a copy of every\n\npaycheck he received each month, implying that the bonuses that Father was to\n\npay 20% to Mother were occasional payments made in addition to his regular\n\nwages.\n\n      Father’s testimony explaining his different payment structures as well as\n\nthe language of the order itself support the dictionary definition of bonus and\n\ncommission and their common, ordinary usage. Black’s Law Dictionary defines\n\nbonus as “a premium paid in addition to what is due or expected.” Black’s Law\n\nDictionary 206 (9th ed. 2009). In the context of employment compensation, a\n\nbonus is “paid for services or on consideration in addition to or in excess of the\n\ncompensation that would ordinarily be given.” Id.; see also Webster’s Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary 252 (3d ed. 2002) (defining bonus as “something given\n\nor received that is over and above what is expected” and “money or an\n\nequivalent given in addition to the usual compensation”). A commission is “a fee\n\npaid to an agent or employee for a particular transaction, usu[ally] as a\n\n\n                                       13\n\fpercentage of the money received from the transaction.” Black’s Law Dictionary\n\n306; see also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 457 (defining\n\ncommission as “a fee paid to an agent or employee for transacting a piece of\n\nbusiness or performing a service,” especially “a percentage of the money\n\nreceived in a sale or other transaction paid to the agent responsible for the\n\nbusiness”).   That portion of Father’s regular monthly paycheck labeled as a\n\ncommission is not a bonus as the term is used in the 2001 modification order.\n\nThe words commission and bonus are not interchangeable. The original divorce\n\ndecree distinguished bonuses and commissions, noting that Father’s employer\n\nwas to withhold child support from Father’s “earnings,” which included “wages,\n\nsalary, commission, bonus, or otherwise.” Had the parties intended Father to\n\npay 20% of his commissions, they could have used the phrase in their agreed\n\norder, like they had done in the past, and required him to pay 20% of his\n\ncommissions or bonuses.\n\n      The 2001 modification order did not require Father to give Mother 20% of\n\nhis commissions. Further, because the trial court did not enter a modification\n\norder after the hearing in 2011, any implied substantive change it made to add\n\nthe word commission to the 2001 order is error. See Escobar v. Escobar, 711\n\nS.W.2d 230, 231–32 (Tex. 1986) (“The court can only correct the entry of a final\n\nwritten judgment that incorrectly states the judgment actually rendered. Thus,\n\neven if the court renders incorrectly, it cannot alter a written judgment which\n\nprecisely reflects the incorrect rendition.”).   The trial court therefore erred by\n\n\n                                         14\n\fcalculating Father’s arrearage to include commissions he earned. We sustain\n\nFather’s fourth and fifth issues.\n\n3. Arrearage\n\n      In Father’s sixth issue, he argues that the trial court erred in ordering\n\nFather to pay an arrearage because the 2001 order is not sufficiently definite to\n\nsupport the judgment. Specifically, he argues that there is no start date for the\n\npayments, that the phrase “net after taxes” is too vague, that there is no firm due\n\ndate for payments, and that the order “does not specifically order [Father] to pay\n\nany portion of future compensation, nor does it state that it applies to subsequent\n\nemployers.”\n\n      To be enforceable by a money judgment, a child support obligation must\n\nbe “sufficiently definite and certain.”   See Wilson, 24 S.W.3d at 905 (citing\n\nVillanueva v. Office of the Attorney Gen., 935 S.W.2d 953, 955 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1996, writ denied), and Gross v. Gross, 808 S.W.2d 215, 218–19 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, no writ)). To be enforceable by contempt, a\n\nchild support obligation must “set forth the terms of compliance in clear, specific\n\nand unambiguous terms so that the person charged with obeying the decree will\n\nreadily know exactly what duties and obligations are imposed upon him.” Id. at\n\n906 (quoting Ex parte Acker, 949 S.W.2d 314, 317 (Tex. 1997)).\n\n      Regarding the start date, Father cites to Ex parte Whitehead, 908 S.W.2d\n\n68, 71 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, orig. proceeding). Whitehead is\n\ninapposite. In Whitehead, a child support order was held to be unenforceable by\n\n\n                                          15\n\fcontempt for a number of reasons, including that “the divorce decree did not\n\norder [the father] to pay any amount of money to anybody at anytime for\n\ninsurance” but instead just ordered the father “to keep and maintain health\n\ninsurance on the children ‘at all times.’” Id. The appellate court specifically noted\n\nthat its opinion was “concerned only with the legality of the contempt findings”\n\nand did not affect the trial court’s money judgment in favor of the mother, which\n\nincluded the unpaid health insurance. Id. at 71 n.3. Father cites to no other case\n\nsupporting his proposition that a child support order is insufficiently definite to\n\nsupport an arrearage because it does not set a start date for periodic payments.\n\nFather was paid bonuses only occasionally, and there was no evidence that he\n\nor anyone else could foresee with any accuracy when those bonuses would be\n\npaid to him. It is clear from the order that any future bonus payment Father was\n\nto receive, starting from the date of the order, he was to pay 20% “net after\n\ntaxes” to Mother. Further, Father conceded that he understood the order well\n\nenough to know that the only bonus he received was subject to a 20% payment\n\nto Mother.\n\n      Father cites In re T.A.N., No. 07-08-0483-CV, 2010 WL 58334, at *4 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Amarillo, no pet.) (mem. op.), for his argument that a child support\n\nobligation that requires a parent to pay a percentage of his net income is too\n\nindefinite to support a judgment of arrearages. In T.A.N., the father was ordered\n\nto pay 20 percent of his net income, calculated as of his wages on July 1, 2008.\n\nId. The parties agreed, however, that the father never provided evidence of his\n\n\n                                         16\n\fwages as of that date, and the calculation had not been done. Id. In this case,\n\nthe calculation was easily accomplished. Father testified that he received a $500\n\nbonus and that Mother was entitled to 20% of his net income from that bonus\n\nafter taxes. Mother offered into evidence Father’s paystubs from 2003, including\n\nthe paystub for the $500 bonus. The paystub noted that $173.25 was deducted\n\nfor taxes, leaving Father a net bonus of $326.75. 20% of $326.75 is $65.35, a\n\ncalculation Father made in his brief on appeal and which he agrees he owes to\n\nMother. The phrase “net after taxes” is not so indefinite or ambiguous that a\n\njudgment for an arrearage computed using the phrase cannot stand. See Dicker\n\nv. Dicker, 434 S.W.2d 707, 712 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1968, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.) (noting that a property settlement between a husband and wife which\n\norders the husband to “pay to the Wife the sum of One Hundred Thousand\n\n($100,000.00[)] Dollars, net after taxes, if any” is “clear and it means what it\n\nsays”).\n\n        Contrary to Father’s argument that there is no firm due date for payments,\n\nthe 2001 order expressly states that Father “is ordered to deliver to [Mother]\n\nwithin ten days of his receipt of any bonus check . . . his personal check for such\n\n20%.”     A ten-day timeframe to make payment to Mother is sufficiently clear,\n\ndefinite, and unambiguous to support a money judgment. Father also argues the\n\norder “does not specifically order [him] to pay any portion of future income, nor\n\ndoes it state that it applies to subsequent employers.” The order requires him to\n\npay 20% “net after taxes” of any bonus he receives; it is an order to pay an\n\n\n                                        17\n\famount that is a clearly defined portion of his income. Finally, the order states\n\nthat Father must make the 20% payment to Mother any time he receives “any\n\nbonus . . . from his employment.” This too is clear enough that Father should\n\n“readily know exactly what duties and obligations are imposed upon him.”\n\nWilson, 24 S.W.3d at 906. We therefore hold that the 2001 order is not so\n\nindefinite that it cannot support a judgment for arrearages.         See Davis v.\n\nMangan, No. 14-04-00650-CV, 2005 WL 1692048, at *7 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] July 21, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding that an order requiring the\n\nfather to “pay 50% of all health care expenses not paid by insurance that are\n\nincurred by or on behalf of the parties’ children” clearly contemplated that the\n\nmother would notify the father when such expenses were incurred and that it was\n\nsufficiently definite and certain to permit its enforcement); In re Watson, No. 07-\n\n00-00162-CV, 2000 WL 1179795, at *4 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Aug. 21, 2000, no\n\npet.) (not designated for publication) (“[A]n order imposing medical support\n\nobligations, including health insurance, need not state a specific dollar amount\n\nfor such obligations to be enforceable.”). We overrule Father’s sixth issue.\n\n4. Enforcement\n\n      In his seventh issue, Father argues that because the 2001 order did not\n\nexpressly state that it was enforceable by contract, Mother cannot enforce the\n\norder for any alleged child support obligations after W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday.\n\nThe family code provides, “To promote the amicable settlement of disputes\n\nbetween the parties to a suit, the parties may enter into a written agreement\n\n\n                                        18\n\fcontaining provisions for support of the child and for modification of the\n\nagreement.” Tex. Fam. Code. Ann. § 154.124(a) (West 2008). However, the\n\nagreement is not enforceable as a contract unless the order expressly states so.\n\nId. § 154.124(c); Bruni v. Bruni, 924 S.W.2d 366, 368 (Tex. 1996); Elfeldt v.\n\nElfeldt, 730 S.W.2d 657, 658 (Tex. 1987).\n\n      Father stated in his motion for new trial that Mother “did not sue for breach\n\nof contract.”   His position now—that Mother is suing on a contract—is an\n\nopposite and inconsistent position to the one he took in the trial court.     See\n\nBrooks v. Brooks, 257 S.W.3d 418, 424 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2008, pet.\n\ndenied) (holding that it would be unconscionable to allow husband to enforce a\n\nmediated settlement agreement after taking “the clearly inconsistent position” at\n\ntrial that it was unenforceable). Further, section 154.124 does not apply to cases\n\nconcerning disabled children. See Elfeldt, 730 S.W.2d at 658 (noting that the\n\n“suit was brought as a contract action because a court of continuing jurisdiction\n\nunder the Family Code has no authority to order or to enforce support for a non-\n\ndisabled child over eighteen”) (emphasis added). Our opinion in In re K.M.J., No.\n\n02–09–00303–CV, 2011 WL 3525439, at *6 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth July 28,\n\n2011, no pet.) (mem. op.), to which Father cites, holds no differently. In K.M.J.,\n\nwe applied the exception for extended child support payments beyond age\n\neighteen to section 154.001, not section 154.302, the section under which the\n\ntrial court in this case had the authority to order W.M.R.’s support. See id.; see\n\nalso Tex. Fam. Code Ann. §§ 154.001, 154.302 (West 2008); Bruni, 924 S.W.2d\n\n\n                                        19\n\fat 367 (noting specifically that none of the children in that case were disabled);\n\nLambourn v. Lambourn, 787 S.W.2d 431, 432 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n1990, writ denied) (noting that section 154.124 (formerly section 14.06(d))\n\n“clearly requires that the parties to an agreement concerning the support of a\n\nnon-disabled child over eighteen must expressly provide in the order\n\nincorporating the agreement that its terms are enforceable as contract terms for\n\nthat remedy to be available”) (emphasis added). We overrule Father’s seventh\n\nissue.\n\n5. Confirmation\n\n         In Father’s eighth issue, he argues that a trial court may not confirm an\n\narrearage when the support order does not contain a specific dollar amount. The\n\nfamily code states, “If a motion for enforcement of child support requests a\n\nmoney judgment for arrearages, the court shall confirm the amount of arrearages\n\nand render one cumulative money judgment.”               Tex. Fam. Code Ann.\n\n§ 157.263(a) (West Supp. 2012). Father does not cite to any case law for his\n\nproposition that an arrearage based on a percentage cannot be confirmed. The\n\nstatute does not require a child support order to state a specific money amount in\n\norder to be confirmed under section 157.263, nor have we found any cases in\n\nwhich a confirmation was denied on this basis. On the contrary, we have found a\n\nnumber of cases in which support payments calculated as a percentage were\n\nrequired to be reduced to a cumulative money judgment. See, e.g., In re J.I.M.,\n\n281 S.W.3d 504, 505, 508 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2008, pet. denied) (holding that\n\n\n                                         20\n\fthe trial court was required under section 157.263 to confirm the amount of\n\narrearages and render an cumulative money judgment when the divorce decree\n\nordered that child support payments be calculated as a percentage of father’s\n\nsalary and that additional child support would be “twenty percent of the net\n\namount of bonuses received by him from his employer”); Davis, 2005 WL\n\n1692048, at *1, *7 (upholding a cumulative money judgment under section\n\n157.263 when the underlying order required father to pay 50% of uninsured\n\nmedical costs); In re S.R.O., 143 S.W.3d 237, 248 (Tex. App.—Waco 2004, no\n\npet.) (concluding that the trial court erred in not including in the cumulative\n\nmoney judgment for arrearages fifty percent of the unreimbursed health care\n\nexpenses the children had incurred). We fail to see how, as Father argues, the\n\ncourt is going beyond acting as a “mere scrivener” when it applies a simple\n\nmathematical formula to determine a percentage of a proven amount. See Curtis\n\nv. Curtis, 11 S.W.3d 466, 471 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2000, no pet.) (noting that under\n\nsection 157.262 “the trial court acts as ‘a mere scrivener’ who mechanically\n\ntallies the amount of arrearages”) (quoting Lewis v. Lewis, 853 S.W.2d 850, 854\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, no writ)). We overrule Father’s eighth\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n\n                                      21\n\f6. Sufficiency of the evidence\n\n      In Father’s ninth issue, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the arrearage amount. Because we sustained Father’s fourth and fifth\n\nissues, we do not need to reach his ninth issue to the extent he complains of the\n\narrearage based on his commissions. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1. As to the\n\narrearage based on his bonus, Father conceded that he received the $500 bonus\n\nand that he owes Mother 20% of that bonus after taxes. We therefore overrule\n\nFather’s ninth issue as to the $65.35 in arrearages.\n\n7. Discretionary order\n\n      In Father’s tenth issue, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby allowing Mother to purchase a van specially equipped to transport W.M.R.’s\n\nwheelchair and by requiring Father to pay half of those expenses. Specifically,\n\nFather complains that there is no reasonableness requirement or some other\n\nmechanism that limits Mother’s ability to incur expenses for which Father would\n\nbe liable.\n\n      Father offers no cases to support this argument.          However, there are\n\nnumerous cases in which the court upheld a child support order requiring one\n\nparent to pay for unquantifiable expenses. See K.M.J., 2011 WL 3525439, at *1\n\n(“The agreed order also required James to pay half of all medical expenses and\n\nhalf of all costs associated with school activities.”); In re A.C.B., 302 S.W.3d 560,\n\n562 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2009, no pet.) (holding that evidence supported trial\n\ncourt’s order requiring father to reimburse mother for half of private school tuition,\n\n\n                                         22\n\ffees, and extracurricular activities); Nordstrom v. Nordstrom, 965 S.W.2d 575,\n\n577 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 1142, 119\n\nS. Ct. 1034 (1999)) (ordering Father to pay half of any necessary tutoring costs\n\nand half of all uninsured medical costs); In Interest of J.M. & G.M., 585 S.W.2d\n\n854, 855 (Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio 1979, no writ) (noting that the divorce\n\ndecree ordered the father to pay for a college education for each of the children;\n\nto remain responsible for one-half of their medical and dental expenses; and to\n\npay all tuition costs).\n\n       Additionally, we note that Mother must pay the other half of the van-related\n\nexpenses, and the evidence was that her income is less than Father’s income.\n\nHer ability to pay her share of the expenses is certainly one limitation on the\n\namount she will incur. Considering that there is no requirement that a court may\n\nonly order support in a definite amount, and considering that Mother is restrained\n\nby her ability to pay the same amount of expenses that Father is required to pay,\n\nwe cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering Father to pay\n\nhalf of any van-related expenses that Mother incurs.       See In re Marriage of\n\nGrossnickle, 115 S.W.3d 238, 248 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2003, no pet.)\n\n(holding that, although not enforceable by contempt, trial court’s order that father\n\npay one half of daughter’s private school tuition, which “ha[d] the potential to\n\nchange from year to year,” was not an abuse of discretion). We overrule Father’s\n\ntenth issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\f8. Agreed Offsets\n\n      In his eleventh issue, Father argues that the trial court did not credit Father\n\nwith the agreed offset of $1,000 for the annuity payments W.M.R. receives. First,\n\nthere is no evidence that the trial court did not credit Father for the offset. The\n\ntrial court’s award matches exactly the amount Mother calculated in the summary\n\nshe provided to the court. Mother’s summary credits Father with $1,000 a month\n\nbeginning at W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday.       Secondly, we sustained Father’s\n\nissue regarding the arrearage based on his commissions and reformed the\n\ncumulative money judgment to $65.35 (20% of Father’s $500 bonus, net after\n\ntaxes), which was not subject to a reduction. We therefore overrule Father’s\n\neleventh issue.\n\n9. Trial amendment\n\n      In Father’s twelfth issue, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby not permitting his trial amendment, which he argues was necessary to\n\ncomport the pleadings with the proof adduced at trial.          Specifically, Father\n\nfocuses on his request to include an affirmative defense that Mother’s claim is\n\ntime barred by a four-year statute of limitations. The trial court held its hearing\n\non February 7, 2011, March 10, 2011, and May 13, 2011. Father filed his motion\n\nfor leave to amend his pleadings on June 29, 2011.            Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 63 states that parties may amend their pleadings after trial by leave of\n\nthe court “unless there is a showing that such filing will operate as a surprise to\n\nthe opposite party.”   Tex. R. Civ. P. 63.     The decision to allow or deny the\n\n\n                                        24\n\famendment rests with the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial court’s\n\ndecision will not be overturned unless it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.\n\nG.R.A.V.I.T.Y. Enters., Inc. v. Reece Supply Co., 177 S.W.3d 537, 542 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2005, no pet.).\n\n      A trial amendment that asserts a new cause of action or defense is\n\n“prejudicial on its face.” Hakemy Bros., Ltd. v. State Bank & Trust Co., Dallas,\n\n189 S.W.3d 920, 924 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, pet. denied) (citing State Bar v.\n\nKilpatrick, 874 S.W.2d 656, 658 (Tex. 1994) (per curiam)). The party opposing\n\nthe amendment generally has the burden to show prejudice or surprise, but the\n\ntrial court may conclude the amendment is on its face calculated to surprise or\n\nthat the amendment would reshape the cause of action, prejudicing the opposing\n\nparty and unnecessarily delaying the trial. Id. at 924, 940; see Chapin & Chapin,\n\nInc. v. Tex. Sand & Gravel Co., Inc., 844 S.W.2d 664, 665 (Tex. 1992); Hardin v.\n\nHardin, 597 S.W.2d 347, 349 (Tex. 1980). In that situation, the opposing party’s\n\nobjection is sufficient to show surprise. Greenhalgh v. Serv. Lloyds Ins. Co., 787\n\nS.W.2d 938, 940 n.3 (Tex. 1990).\n\n      To support his argument that the amendment would have conformed the\n\npleadings to the evidence presented at trial by Mother, thereby creating no\n\nsurprise or prejudice, Father cites to Krishnan v. Ramirez, 42 S.W.3d 205, 225\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2001, pet denied). In Krishnan, the appellate court\n\nupheld the trial court’s decision to allow a post-trial amendment because the\n\n“appellant did not make any showing to the trial court that her settlement strategy\n\n\n                                        25\n\for her trial posture would have changed knowing that she risked full range\n\nexposure at trial. She has not shown evidence of surprise or prejudice.” Id. In\n\nKrishnan, the appellant contended that she was prejudiced because “the\n\namended pleadings exposed her to a full claim instead of the two-thirds claim\n\nand her settlement strategy would have been greatly influenced by knowing that\n\nshe risked full range exposure at trial.”    Id.   Krishnan, however, is not fully\n\nsupportive of Father’s argument for two reasons. First, the appellee in Krishnan\n\nsought to amend his pleadings during the trial, while here Father sought an\n\namendment forty-seven days after three hearings were concluded.             See id.\n\nSecond, in Krishnan the appellee was not seeking to add a new cause of action\n\nor defense while here, Father has sought to add numerous new causes of action.\n\nSee id.\n\n      Father also argues that Mother only offered general, conclusory, non-\n\nspecific contentions of being surprised or prejudiced; she did not offer a\n\nsupporting affidavit for her objection, and no witnesses were called at the hearing\n\ntestifying to specific facts to support her surprise or prejudice. Father, however,\n\ndoes not cite any case law to support this argument that Mother must prove any\n\nof these things to substantiate her surprise or prejudice. To the contrary, Mother\n\nonly had to object to the trial amendment alleging surprise or prejudice, because\n\nin a situation where “the amendment would reshape the cause of action,\n\nprejudicing the opposing party . . . the opposing party’s objection is sufficient to\n\nshow surprise.” Hakemy Bros., 189 S.W.3d at 924; see Chapin & Chapin, 844\n\n\n                                        26\n\fS.W.2d at 665 (“A party opposing a trial amendment does not have to prove\n\nprejudice or surprise if the amendment is a substantive one which changes the\n\nnature of the trial.”); Greenhalgh, 787 S.W.2d at 940 (“A newly plead affirmative\n\ndefense substantially changes the nature of a trial unlike adding a verified plea\n\nconforming to issues already pleaded, amending the amount of damages\n\nclaimed.”). Father pointed to no evidence indicating that Mother should have\n\nknown that Father’s affirmative limitations defense would be at issue. See White\n\nv. Sullins, 917 S.W.2d 158, 161 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1996, writ denied)\n\n(holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a trial amendment\n\nadding a comparative negligence defense when “the record contains nothing\n\nindicating the plaintiffs should have known comparative negligence was an\n\nissue”). We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the\n\ntrial amendment. See Hakemy Bros., 189 S.W.3d at 926; see also Burroughs\n\nCorp. v. Farmers Dairies, 538 S.W.2d 809, 811 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1976,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.) (“It is held that a trial amendment ordinarily should be denied\n\nwhen sought after the evidence for both parties has been fully offered and when\n\nit would change the theory of the trial.”).\n\n      Father argues that, in the alternative, the statute of limitations issue was\n\ntried by consent.     Father claims that the issue of the amount and date of\n\npayments were fully litigated during the trial. He also argues that “[t]he evidence\n\nadduced at trial made clear that the four year statute of limitations barred the\n\nrecovery sought by [Mother], because she was seeking to recover alleged\n\n\n                                          27\n\fpayments which she claimed were due nearly ten years prior.” To determine\n\nwhether an issue was tried by consent, the court must examine the record not for\n\nevidence of the issue, but rather for evidence of trial of the issue. In re P.D.D.,\n\n256 S.W.3d 834, 840 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, no pet.). Rule 67 applies\n\n“where it clearly appears from the record as a whole that the parties tried out a\n\ncontroverted issue and that the issue was fully developed.” Fiduciary Mortgage\n\nCo. v. City Nat’l Bank of Irving, 762 S.W.2d 196, 202 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1988,\n\nwrit denied); See Tex. R. Civ. P. 67; Praeger v. Wilson, 721 S.W.2d 597, 603\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.). “A party’s unpleaded issue may\n\nbe deemed tried by consent when evidence on the issue is developed under\n\ncircumstances indicating both parties understood the issue was in the case, and\n\nthe other party failed to make an appropriate complaint.” Case Corp. v. Hi-Class\n\nBus. Sys. of Am., Inc., 184 S.W.3d 760, 771 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, pet.\n\ndenied). However, “trial by consent is inapplicable when evidence relevant to an\n\nunpleaded matter is also relevant to a pleaded issue; in that case admission of\n\nthe evidence would not be calculated to elicit an objection.” Id. (citing In re J.M.,\n\n156 S.W.3d 696, 705 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.)).            In this case, the\n\namount and date of payment were raised to enforce the 2001 child support order;\n\nnothing in the record indicates that Mother understood that limitations was at\n\nissue or that the evidence of dates of payment should have elicited an objection.\n\nBecause the evidence to which Father cites in support of his limitations claim\n\nwas relevant to pleaded issues, trial by consent is inapplicable in this case. See\n\n\n                                         28\n\fP.D.D., 256 S.W.3d at 840; Case Corp., 184 S.W.3d at 771.              We overrule\n\nFather’s twelfth issue.\n\n10. Excessive support\n\n      In Father’s thirteenth issue, he argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by ordering Father to pay excessive child support. He claims that the\n\ntrial court did not take into consideration Father’s ability to pay and his right of\n\nself-subsistence. To determine the amount of support to be paid after a child’s\n\neighteenth birthday, section 154.306 of the family code states that the court shall\n\ngive special consideration to the following factors:\n\n      (1) any existing or future needs of the adult child directly related to\n      the adult child’s mental or physical disability and the substantial care\n      and personal supervision directly required by or related to that\n      disability;\n\n      (2) whether the parent pays for or will pay for the care or supervision\n      of the adult child or provides or will provide substantial care or\n      personal supervision of the adult child;\n\n      (3) the financial resources available to both parents for the support,\n      care, and supervision of the adult child; and\n\n      (4) any other financial resources or other resources or programs\n      available for the support, care, and supervision of the adult child.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.306 (West 2008).\n\n      As to the first factor, the court heard testimony from Mother concerning\n\nW.M.R.’s existing and future needs. Documentary evidence was also presented\n\nand considered. See In re J.L.F., No. 04-01-00654-CV, 2002 WL 1625572, at *3\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio July 24, 2002, no pet.) (not designated for publication)\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f(holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the first factor when mother\n\ntestified that the adult child’s disability existed and required medical attention,\n\nthus indicating that “it [was] likely that substantial care and personal supervision\n\nare required to help [the adult child] with her disability”); see also In re Gonzalez,\n\n993 S.W.2d 149, 159–60 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, no pet.) (noting that no\n\nexpert testimony is required to determine if a child’s need exists).\n\n      Turning to whether the parent pays or provides for the care or supervision\n\nof the adult child, the trial court also considered substantial evidence to support\n\nthis factor. Both parents are not required to make equal monetary contributions.\n\nInstead, each parent must “contribute money or services to the support and\n\nmaintenance of the children according to the respective ability of each parent and\n\nthe needs of the children.” Rose v. Rubenstein, 693 S.W.2d 580, 583 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1985, writ dism’d).        (“In determining child support\n\nobligations, courts often recognize that parents make different contributions to a\n\nchild’s welfare.”).     The court heard substantial evidence about Mother’s\n\ncontinuous care for W.M.R. as the primary caregiver. Father did not provide\n\ndaily care for W.M.R.\n\n      Sufficient evidence was also presented for the third factor, the financial\n\nresources available to both parents. The amount of child support that each\n\nparent pays does not solely depend on their earnings.           Instead, “[t]he court\n\nshould consider the financial resources available to each parent, the respective\n\nobligations borne by each parent, nonfinancial contributions made and the\n\n\n                                         30\n\fstandard of living to which the children have been accustomed.” See id. (citing\n\nHazelwood v. Jinkins, 580 S.W.2d 33 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1979,\n\nno writ)). For 2010, Mother’s annual income was less than $70,000 and Father’s\n\nannual income was approximately $90,000. Further, Mother was ordered to pay\n\nfor half of W.M.R.’s expenses even though she is the primary caregiver for\n\nW.M.R. and her annual income and net resources are less than Father’s. Father\n\nargues that the court did not consider his right to self-subsistence, citing Valaque\n\nv. Valaque, 574 S.W.2d 608 (Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio 1978, no writ), which\n\nstands for the proposition that “[t]here is some minimum amount necessary for a\n\nbare [subsistence], and less than such amount renders a child support order\n\nunenforceable.” Id. at 609–610 (citing Anderson v. Anderson, 503 S.W.2d 124,\n\n127 (Tex. Civ. App—Corpus Christi 1973, no writ)). However, the duty to pay\n\nchild support is not determined solely by an obligor’s ability to pay from earnings,\n\nbut also by his ability to pay from any and all sources that may be available. See\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.062 (West Supp. 2012); In Interest of S.B.C., 952\n\nS.W.2d 15, 18 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1997, no writ).            Here, evidence of\n\nFather’s significant financial assets included a Toyota 4Runner, a motorcycle, a\n\nBMW, an RV-Ford, a boat, a jet ski, a glider, a trailer, and a plane. See Krempp\n\nv. Krempp, 590 S.W.2d 229, 231 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1979, no writ)\n\n(ordering Father to pay $1000 in child support was not excessive after reviewing\n\nevidence reflecting a Mercedes-Benz automobile and an airplane).           Father’s\n\nfinancial information admitted into evidence showed two checking accounts with\n\n\n                                        31\n\fbalances of roughly $58,000 and $26,000, a 401k with a balance of\n\napproximately $55,000, and an IRA with a balance of almost $70,000. There\n\nwas no evidence presented by Father that he is unable to pay the support.\n\n       Finally, the trial court considered sufficient evidence of other financial\n\nresources for the support, care, and supervision of W.M.R.          This evidence\n\nincluded the annuity payment that W.M.R. receives in the amount of $1,000 a\n\nmonth. This amount, however, is not sufficient to cover all of W.M.R.’s monthly\n\nexpenses. See Rose, 693 S.W.2d at 583 (noting that “[t]he record is quite clear\n\nthat Eddie’s earnings of $560 per month do not cover his documented expenses\n\nof $862 per month. . . . Our review of the record indicates that Eddie is not\n\ncurrently self-supporting.”).   Mother testified that W.M.R.’s monthly expenses\n\nwere $3,931.     Mother’s estimation included items that Father was already\n\nresponsible for paying, such as medical expenses. It was reasonable for the trial\n\ncourt to reduce Mother’s estimation by those expenses and then order Father to\n\npay half of the reduced amount. Father’s savings, salary, and other financial\n\nassets demonstrate that he has the financial ability to support himself and his\n\nson.   Because the trial court considered sufficient evidence to support each\n\nfactor, it did not abuse its discretion. See In re M.W.T., 12 S.W.3d 598, 607\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2000, pet. denied) (“Because the record contains\n\ninformation concerning all of the Section 154.306 criteria, the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in assessing current child support.”). The trial court’s child\n\nsupport order is not excessive. We overrule Father’s thirteenth issue.\n\n\n                                        32\n\f11. Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In his fourteenth issue, Father argues that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by awarding attorney’s fees to Mother without an adequate evidentiary\n\nfoundation. Specifically, Father makes two arguments: (1) that Mother failed to\n\nintroduce any evidence that the hourly rates charged by her attorneys were\n\nreasonable; and (2) Mother’s attorney’s fees should not be allowed because the\n\nfees were not segregated between the enforcement action and the modification\n\naction.\n\n      The trial court has broad discretion in awarding attorney’s fees in family\n\nlaw matters that involve the parent-child relationship. Hardin, 161 S.W.3d at 24\n\n(citing Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 106.002 (Vernon 2002)); Bruni, 924 S.W.2d at\n\n368). This award, however, must be supported by evidence. Id. (citing Thomas\n\nv. Thomas, 895 S.W.2d 895, 898 (Tex. App.—Waco 1995, no writ)).              An\n\nattorney’s sworn testimony concerning an attorney’s fees award is considered\n\nexpert testimony. Id. (citing Nguyen Ngoc Giao v. Smith & Lamm, P.C., 714\n\nS.W.2d 144, 148 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1986, no writ)).\n\n      Father argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the attorney’s\n\nfee award because Mother’s attorney did not introduce evidence that the specific\n\nhourly rate charged by each attorney and paralegal was reasonable. Specificity,\n\nhowever, is not required.    Instead, “[t]o support a request for reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees, testimony should be given regarding the hours spent on the\n\ncase, the nature of preparation, complexity of the case, experience of the\n\n\n                                      33\n\fattorney, and the prevailing hourly rates.”      Hardin, 161 S.W.3d at 24 (citing\n\nGoudeau v. Marquez, 830 S.W.2d 681, 683 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n1992, no writ)). The court does not need to hear evidence on each factor but can\n\n“look at the entire record, the evidence presented on reasonableness, the\n\namount in controversy, the common knowledge of the participants as lawyers\n\nand judges, and the relative success of the parties.” Hagedorn v. Tisdale, 73\n\nS.W.3d 341, 353 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2002, no pet.) (citing Chilton Ins. Co. v.\n\nPate & Pate Enters., Inc., 930 S.W.2d 877, 896 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1996,\n\nwrit denied)).\n\n      In In re A.S.G., 345 S.W.3d 443, 451 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2011, no\n\npet.), the attorney “did not testify to her hourly rate or exact number of hours\n\nspent on the case, [but] she did specifically ask for $1,500 in attorney’s fees and\n\nexplained to the trial court their necessity and reasonableness.” The court held\n\nthat this comports with the basic requirements and was sufficient to support the\n\nattorney’s fee award. Id. at 451–52.      In this case, Mother’s attorney testified\n\nregarding each issue and presented an affidavit and billing record.              The\n\ntestimony reflected the attorney’s experience, the novelty and difficulty of the\n\nissue in this case, and his opinion that his hourly rate of $250 was “traditional” for\n\nDenton County. He also detailed his work and preparations for this case. The\n\nattorney’s testimony and evidence is a reasonable basis for the award of\n\n$29,495.51 for Mother’s attorney’s fees. See In re A.B.P., 291 S.W.3d 91, 98–99\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.) (concluding that attorney’s testimony that he\n\n\n                                         34\n\fbelieved his fees were reasonable and necessary, that he was familiar with the\n\ncustomary fees in the community, and that he believed his fees fall within that\n\nrange was sufficient for attorney’s fee award); Henry v. Henry, 48 S.W.3d 468,\n\n481 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, no pet.)        (holding that testimony\n\n“regarding the reasonableness of the fees, the hours worked, the rate charged,\n\nand the services provided” was sufficient evidence for attorney’s fee award).\n\n       Father also contends that Mother’s attorney’s fees should not be allowed\n\nbecause the fees were not segregated between the enforcement action and the\n\nmodification action. Segregation of attorney’s fees is required when two or more\n\ncauses of action are involved. In such a case, “the party asserting those causes\n\nmust allocate the time spent between those for which attorneys’ fees may be\n\nrecovered and those for which they may not.” See S. Concrete Co. v. Metrotec\n\nFin., Inc., 775 S.W.2d 446, 449 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1989, no writ) (citing Bullock\n\nv. Kehoe, 678 S.W.2d 558, 560 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.)).   An exception exists “when the attorney’s fees rendered are in\n\nconnection with claims arising out of the same transaction and are so interrelated\n\nthat their ‘prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same\n\nfacts.’” Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 11–12 (Tex. 1991).\n\nHowever, “it is only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n\nunrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be\n\nsegregated.” Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313–314\n\n(Tex. 2006). A court must examine the facts alleged in support of the claim to\n\n\n                                       35\n\fdetermine whether the claims are inextricably intertwined. See Kurtz v. Kurtz,\n\n158 S.W.3d 12, 22 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied) (citing\n\nStewart Title, 822 S.W.2d at 11–12). If the prosecution or defense does not\n\nentail proof or denial of essentially the same facts, the exception does not apply.\n\nAir Routing Int’l Corp. (Canada) v. Britannia Airways, Ltd., 150 S.W.3d 682, 687\n\n(Tex. App—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.).\n\n      Attorney’s fees are recoverable in both an enforcement action and\n\nmodification action. See Beck v. Walker, 154 S.W.3d 895 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2005, no pet.) (noting that “[w]hether to award attorney fees, pursuant to the\n\nFamily Code, to a child support obligee who successfully moves to enforce child\n\nsupport is within the discretion of the trial court); In the Interest of H.S.N., 69\n\nS.W.3d 829, 835 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (finding no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in award of attorney’s fees as child support regarding motion to modify\n\nand motion to transfer). In this case, the modification action and the enforcement\n\naction were based on the same facts.         Mother’s attorney testified as to the\n\nsimilarity in preparation for the hearings on both issues. Mother was therefore\n\nnot required to segregate her attorney’s fees.     See Kurtz, 158 S.W.3d at 24\n\n(holding that mother’s defense of father’s counterclaims to decrease child\n\nsupport and his claim for offsets for payments made directly to mother, are\n\ninextricably intertwined with her child support modification claims because those\n\nclaims “arise out of the same transaction and are so interrelated that their\n\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\fprosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts”).

The only child of\n\nthe marriage was W.M.R., who was nine years old. The final divorce decree\n\nstated:\n\n            The court finds that [W.M.R.] suffers from muscular dystrophy\n      and will be incapable of being self supporting after the age of\n      eighteen.\n\n            IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that [Father] is obligated to\n      pay and, shall pay to [Mother] child support of $1500.00 per month\n      for [W.M.R.] in monthly installments . . . until the date of the earliest\n      occurrence of one of the following events:\n\n             a. the child dies;\n\n             b. further order modifying this child support;\n\n           c. $1,000 monthly payments are commenced to [W.M.R.]\n      pursuant to New York Life Insurance Company annuity policy.\n\n            Upon the commencement of the $1,000.00 monthly annuity\n      payments set forth in paragraph c above[,] the support obligation of\n      [Father] shall be reduced to $500.00 per month . . . and continuing\n      thereafter until the first of the contingencies set forth in paragraph a\n      and b above occurs.\n\nFather’s employer was ordered to withhold child support from Father’s earnings.\n\n“Earnings” was defined as “compensation paid or payable to [Father] for personal\n\nservices, whether called wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise.”\n\nFather was also required to provide and maintain medical insurance coverage for\n\nW.M.R. and to pay for fifty percent of all health care expenses not covered by\n\ninsurance.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f      On August 16, 2001, the trial court modified the child support provisions of\n\nthe divorce decree. The 2001 order states,\n\n      The prior Order of this Court entitled DECREE OF DIVORCE[,]\n      which was signed by the Court on October 3, 2000[,] is hereby\n      modified as follows:\n\n      . . . [Father] shall pay to [Mother] child support of $870.75 each\n      month . . . until the first month following the date of the earliest\n      occurrence of one of the events specified below:\n\n            (1) the child dies;\n\n            (2) further order modifying this child support;\n\n            (3) $1,000.00 monthly payments are commenced to [W.M.R.]\n            pursuant to New York Life Ins. Co. annuity policy.\n\n      Upon the commencement of the $1,000.00 monthly annuity\n      payments set forth above the support obligation of [Father] shall be\n      reduced by such sum commencing the first day of the first month\n      following the commencement of the annuity payments.\n\nThe order also stated that Father should pay 20% “of the net after taxes of any\n\nbonus he receives from his employment,” and required Father to deliver to\n\nMother a copy of the bonus check.\n\n      The new order did not change Father’s duties regarding medical insurance\n\nor uncovered medical expenses.\n\n      When W.M.R. turned eighteen in October, 2008, Father stopped paying\n\nchild support. On September 22, 2010, Mother filed a “Petition to Enforce Child\n\nSupport Order and to Modify Parent-Child Relationship.” Mother alleged that\n\nFather failed to pay any child support from his employment bonuses, and\n\nbecause of W.M.R.’s disability, she asked the court to modify the child support\n\n\n                                         3\n\forder to extend child support payments “for an indefinite period” and to require\n\nFather to pay, “as additional support, a portion of the uninsured expenses for\n\nmedical supplies, equipment, in-home care, over-the-counter medications, and\n\nother related expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance on the wheelchair-\n\nequipped van and replacement costs, if necessary.” She sought an arrearage for\n\nthe unpaid child support since W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday. Father responded\n\nto Mother’s motion, arguing that the order was incapable of enforcement because\n\nit is ambiguous, and that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the case.\n\n      After a hearing, the trial court entered an order on July 7, 2011, finding that\n\nFather owed Mother $38,158.73 in unpaid child support. The trial court ordered\n\nFather to pay the arrearage plus $1,465.50 a month for W.M.R.’s needs, fifty\n\npercent of W.M.R.’s medical expenses, and fifty percent of “all expenses to\n\nreplace the wheel-chair equipped van.” Father then filed this appeal.\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n1. Jurisdiction\n\n      In Father’s first three issues, he challenges the trial court’s jurisdiction to\n\nmake the 2011 modification. A court acquires continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in\n\nsuits affecting the parent-child relationship by the rendition of a final order. Tex.\n\nFam. Code Ann. § 155.001(a) (West 2008). The court retains its jurisdiction until\n\n(1) an order of adoption is rendered; (2) the parents have remarried each other;\n\nor (3) another court assumes jurisdiction by rendering a final order based on\n\nincorrect information that there was no court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                          4\n\fId. §§ 155.002, 155.004(a) (West 2008).        A court with continuing, exclusive\n\njurisdiction may modify its prior order regarding child support.      Id. § 155.003\n\n(West 2008). A suit for support for a minor or adult disabled child may be filed in\n\nthe court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction as a suit for a modification.     Id.\n\n§ 154.305(c) (West 2008).\n\n      In this case, the court acquired jurisdiction in 2000 with the rendition of the\n\nfinal divorce decree. Father argues that his child support obligation ended when\n\nW.M.R. turned eighteen for two reasons.         First, he argues that the annuity\n\npayment “zeroed out” his child support obligation, thereby ending it. The 2001\n\norder states that once the annuity payments commenced, Father’s obligation\n\n“shall be reduced by” the amount of the annuity payments. Because Father’s\n\nobligation was for less than the amount of the annuity payments, Father argues\n\nhis obligation ended when the annuity payment began.            Father’s argument\n\nignores the language of the 2001 order which states that Father’s obligation\n\ncontinues until W.M.R.’s death or further order by the trial court.             The\n\ncommencement of the annuity payments does not extinguish Father’s obligation,\n\nit merely reduces it.\n\n      Second, Father argues that the trial court did not make the required\n\nfindings to continue child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday. Section\n\n154.302 of the family code states:\n\n      (a) The court may order either or both parents to provide for the\n      support of a child for an indefinite period and may determine the\n      rights and duties of the parents if the court finds that:\n\n\n                                         5\n\f            (1) the child, whether institutionalized or not, requires\n            substantial care and personal supervision because of a mental\n            or physical disability and will not be capable of self-support;\n            and\n\n            (2) the disability exists, or the cause of the disability is known\n            to exist, on or before the 18th birthday of the child.\n\nTex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.302 (West 2008). Thus, the court cannot order\n\ncontinued child support unless it finds that the child requires substantial care and\n\npersonal supervision and will not be capable of self-support. See id. Father\n\nargues first that the 2001 agreed order “completely superseded all prior orders\n\nregarding child support.”     Because the agreed order contains no findings\n\nregarding W.M.R.’s disability, he continues, it is insufficient to support the trial\n\ncourt’s order of support.   Second, he argues that the findings in the original\n\ndivorce decree that W.M.R. “suffers from muscular dystrophy and will be\n\nincapable of being self[-]supporting after the age of eighteen” are insufficient\n\nunder the statute.    Father also argues that we may not imply the findings\n\nnecessary to support the judgment.\n\n      In support of Father’s argument that the agreed order “completely\n\nsuperseded” the divorce decree, he cites In re Clark for the proposition that “[a]n\n\norder modifying a prior child custody or support order necessarily supersedes the\n\nprior order . . . . Thus, an order modifying a prior child support order may . . .\n\n‘terminate’ the obligation imposed by the prior order . . . .” No. 10-03-00037-CV,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1632768</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (Tex.

The only change to Father’s child support obligations was a\n\nreduction of his monthly payments from $1,500 to $870.75. The 2001 agreed\n\norder made no modification to the findings that W.M.R. suffers from muscular\n\ndystrophy and will be incapable of supporting himself after the age of eighteen.\n\nThus, those findings remain even after the changes imposed by the agreed\n\norder.\n\n         Turning to whether the trial court’s findings are sufficient to support an\n\norder of child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday, we note that the\n\nstatute requires the trial court to find that W.M.R. (1) requires substantial care\n\nand personal supervision because of a mental or physical disability and (2) will\n\nnot be capable of self-support. See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 154.302(a)(1) (West\n\n2008).     The divorce decree includes the finding that W.M.R. would not be\n\n\n                                          7\n\fcapable of self-support but does not explicitly state that W.M.R. requires\n\nsubstantial care and personal supervision. Father argues that the finding that\n\nW.M.R. requires substantial care and personal supervision must be stated in the\n\norder and that we cannot imply the finding.\n\n      Father did not request findings pursuant to rule 296 or rule 298 of the rules\n\nof civil procedure, and there were no separately entered findings of fact or\n\nconclusions of law after the divorce decree or any of the modification orders.\n\nSee Tex.

Father argues that “when the Court makes express\n\nfindings in support of its judgment, it is improper to imply other findings\n\nnecessary to support the judgment.” However, the cases Father cites in support\n\ndo not stand for this proposition.

R. Civ. P. 299. The cases that Father cites all involve a ground of recovery\n\nor defense in which no elements were found by the trial court. See C.A.B., 289\n\nS.W.3d at 881 (holding that it could not imply termination on one ground when no\n\nfindings were made on that ground and termination was expressly granted on\n\nanother ground); E.F. Hutton, 518 S.W.2d at 856 (noting that the issue was\n\n“whether the court has made findings of any elements of contract or promissory\n\nestoppel, so that ‘omitted unrequested elements’ may be supported by\n\npresumption under the provisions of Rule 299”, and holding that none of the trial\n\ncourt’s findings established “any element of either of these grounds of recovery”).\n\n      In this case, the trial court found that W.M.R. will not be capable of self-\n\nsupport after the age of eighteen.     Inability to self-support is one of the two\n\nelements needed to support child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday.\n\nTherefore, the omitted element of requiring substantial care and personal\n\nsupervision may, under rule 299, be supplied by presumption if it is supported by\n\nthe evidence. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 299.\n\n      Although we do not have the record of the original divorce hearing, Father\n\ndoes not contend that W.M.R.’s health has improved since that time, and the\n\nevidence at the last hearing supports the implied finding that W.M.R. continues to\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\frequire substantial care and personal supervision. As stated in the final divorce\n\ndecree, W.M.R. has muscular dystrophy. Mother testified that W.M.R.’s disease\n\nis “incurable, and it is progressive,” and that people with muscular dystrophy\n\n“eventually die because of heart and lung failure. But before that happens, they\n\nare essentially paralyzed because their muscles have completely broken down.”\n\nW.M.R.’s heart and lungs are impaired and he cannot lift his arms.          Mother\n\ntestified that she goes home every day at lunch to check on W.M.R. and that she\n\nhas to leave work unexpectedly “usually once or twice a week” to help him with\n\nsomething he needs. She testified that she has to take him to the doctor and\n\npick up his medications. Mother testified that W.M.R. “is not able to feed or dress\n\nhimself or get himself a drink or go to the toilet alone or bathe himself or any of\n\nthose things.” Every morning, Mother dresses W.M.R., washes his face, brushes\n\nhis teeth, shaves him, and gets him into his wheelchair. She testified that it takes\n\nher about an hour and a half to get him ready for bed, because she has to bathe\n\nhim, take care of his toiletries, give him his medications and breathing therapy,\n\nand get him into bed. Mother wakes up every two hours to roll W.M.R. over.\n\nShe testified that W.M.R. can only be alone for about four hours before he needs\n\nassistance. Mother has to get someone to stay with him when she is away.\n\n      Although W.M.R. does not need constant supervision, the testimony at the\n\nhearing was sufficient to support a finding that he requires substantial care and\n\nfrequent personal supervision. Thus, because the evidence supports the omitted\n\nelement that W.M.R. requires substantial care and personal supervision, we may\n\n\n                                        10\n\fsupply that element under rule 299. Thus, the trial court’s findings are sufficient\n\nto support an order of child support beyond W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday. We\n\noverrule Father’s first, second, and third issues.\n\n2. Bonus\n\n      In Father’s fourth and fifth issues, he argues that the trial court erred in\n\ncalculating Father’s arrearage to include commissions he earned.        The 2011\n\norder included a finding that Father failed to pay $38,158.73 in child support.\n\nBecause the annuity payments covered all of Father’s child support obligation\n\nafter W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday, this amount could only be based on that part\n\nof the 2001 order which ordered additional child support in “a sum equal to 20%\n\nof the net after taxes of any bonus [Father] receive[d] from his employment.”2\n\nMother argues that the term “bonus” includes payments Father received that\n\nwere labeled by his employer as commissions.3\n\n      The 2001 modification order requires Father to pay 20% “of the net after\n\ntaxes of any bonus he receives from his employment,” and required Father to\n\ndeliver to Mother a copy of the bonus check. The modification order was an\n\nagreed judgment, and as such, should be construed in the same manner as a\n\ncontract. Gulf Ins. Co. v.

See Coker v. Coker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1502612\"><a href=\"/opinion/1502612/coker-v-coker/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393 (Tex.\n\n1983).\n\n      Father testified that he was paid bonuses from previous employers, but he\n\nhas not received any bonuses with his current employer. At the time of the 2001\n\nmodification, he received bonuses based upon certain criteria such as “[s]ales\n\nvolume, management objectives, [and] strategic objectives.” He claims that he\n\nmade his salary plus bonuses but did not receive commissions.\n\n      In 2004, Father accepted his current position. In his current job, Father\n\nreceives a base salary plus commission which is based “[s]trictly [on] sales\n\nvolume.”    He testified that his “regular pay” is his base salary plus the\n\ncommissions he receives. He also testified that his understanding of the word\n\nbonus as used in the order is “a recognized achievement of a particular goal.”\n\n      Mother testified that during their marriage, Father received his base salary\n\nplus bonuses that he received “several times throughout the year.”           At the\n\nhearing, she referred to the commissions that he received in his current job as\n\nbonuses because “[t]hat’s how he’s always described it to me.” Mother argues\n\nthat her testimony regarding the parties’ understanding of the term “bonus”\n\ndemonstrates that they both understood the term in the 2001 modification order\n\nto include commissions. However, Father testified that his payment in his current\n\nposition is structured differently than it was in his previous positions. Mother did\n\n\n                                        12\n\fnot testify that after changing jobs to his current position that he continued to\n\nrefer to “bonuses” that he received. Mother’s testimony only demonstrates her\n\nunderstanding of bonuses in Father’s previous payment structures, which were\n\nstructured as salary plus bonuses “throughout the year.”         Father’s current\n\npayment structure is salary plus commissions that were included in his regular\n\nwage checks. The 2001 modification order stated that Father was “ordered to\n\ndeliver to [Mother] within ten days of his receipt of any bonus check a copy of\n\nsuch check.” The order did not state that Father was to deliver a copy of every\n\npaycheck he received each month, implying that the bonuses that Father was to\n\npay 20% to Mother were occasional payments made in addition to his regular\n\nwages.\n\n      Father’s testimony explaining his different payment structures as well as\n\nthe language of the order itself support the dictionary definition of bonus and\n\ncommission and their common, ordinary usage. Black’s Law Dictionary defines\n\nbonus as “a premium paid in addition to what is due or expected.” Black’s Law\n\nDictionary 206 (9th ed. 2009). In the context of employment compensation, a\n\nbonus is “paid for services or on consideration in addition to or in excess of the\n\ncompensation that would ordinarily be given.” Id.; see also Webster’s Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary 252 (3d ed. 2002) (defining bonus as “something given\n\nor received that is over and above what is expected” and “money or an\n\nequivalent given in addition to the usual compensation”). A commission is “a fee\n\npaid to an agent or employee for a particular transaction, usu[ally] as a\n\n\n                                       13\n\fpercentage of the money received from the transaction.” Black’s Law Dictionary\n\n306; see also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 457 (defining\n\ncommission as “a fee paid to an agent or employee for transacting a piece of\n\nbusiness or performing a service,” especially “a percentage of the money\n\nreceived in a sale or other transaction paid to the agent responsible for the\n\nbusiness”).   That portion of Father’s regular monthly paycheck labeled as a\n\ncommission is not a bonus as the term is used in the 2001 modification order.\n\nThe words commission and bonus are not interchangeable. The original divorce\n\ndecree distinguished bonuses and commissions, noting that Father’s employer\n\nwas to withhold child support from Father’s “earnings,” which included “wages,\n\nsalary, commission, bonus, or otherwise.” Had the parties intended Father to\n\npay 20% of his commissions, they could have used the phrase in their agreed\n\norder, like they had done in the past, and required him to pay 20% of his\n\ncommissions or bonuses.\n\n      The 2001 modification order did not require Father to give Mother 20% of\n\nhis commissions. Further, because the trial court did not enter a modification\n\norder after the hearing in 2011, any implied substantive change it made to add\n\nthe word commission to the 2001 order is error.

In Whitehead, a child support order was held to be unenforceable by\n\n\n                                          15\n\fcontempt for a number of reasons, including that “the divorce decree did not\n\norder [the father] to pay any amount of money to anybody at anytime for\n\ninsurance” but instead just ordered the father “to keep and maintain health\n\ninsurance on the children ‘at all times.’” Id. The appellate court specifically noted\n\nthat its opinion was “concerned only with the legality of the contempt findings”\n\nand did not affect the trial court’s money judgment in favor of the mother, which\n\nincluded the unpaid health insurance. Id. at 71 n.3. Father cites to no other case\n\nsupporting his proposition that a child support order is insufficiently definite to\n\nsupport an arrearage because it does not set a start date for periodic payments.\n\nFather was paid bonuses only occasionally, and there was no evidence that he\n\nor anyone else could foresee with any accuracy when those bonuses would be\n\npaid to him. It is clear from the order that any future bonus payment Father was\n\nto receive, starting from the date of the order, he was to pay 20% “net after\n\ntaxes” to Mother. Further, Father conceded that he understood the order well\n\nenough to know that the only bonus he received was subject to a 20% payment\n\nto Mother.\n\n      Father cites In re T.A.N., No. 07-08-0483-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">58334</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Amarillo, no pet.) (mem. op.), for his argument that a child support\n\nobligation that requires a parent to pay a percentage of his net income is too\n\nindefinite to support a judgment of arrearages. In T.A.N., the father was ordered\n\nto pay 20 percent of his net income, calculated as of his wages on July 1, 2008.\n\nId. The parties agreed, however, that the father never provided evidence of his\n\n\n                                         16\n\fwages as of that date, and the calculation had not been done. Id. In this case,\n\nthe calculation was easily accomplished. Father testified that he received a $500\n\nbonus and that Mother was entitled to 20% of his net income from that bonus\n\nafter taxes. Mother offered into evidence Father’s paystubs from 2003, including\n\nthe paystub for the $500 bonus. The paystub noted that $173.25 was deducted\n\nfor taxes, leaving Father a net bonus of $326.75. 20% of $326.75 is $65.35, a\n\ncalculation Father made in his brief on appeal and which he agrees he owes to\n\nMother. The phrase “net after taxes” is not so indefinite or ambiguous that a\n\njudgment for an arrearage computed using the phrase cannot stand. See Dicker\n\nv.

Father also argues the\n\norder “does not specifically order [him] to pay any portion of future income, nor\n\ndoes it state that it applies to subsequent employers.” The order requires him to\n\npay 20% “net after taxes” of any bonus he receives; it is an order to pay an\n\n\n                                        17\n\famount that is a clearly defined portion of his income.

The\n\nfamily code states, “If a motion for enforcement of child support requests a\n\nmoney judgment for arrearages, the court shall confirm the amount of arrearages\n\nand render one cumulative money judgment.”               Tex.

Sufficiency of the evidence\n\n      In Father’s ninth issue, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the arrearage amount. Because we sustained Father’s fourth and fifth\n\nissues, we do not need to reach his ninth issue to the extent he complains of the\n\narrearage based on his commissions. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1. As to the\n\narrearage based on his bonus, Father conceded that he received the $500 bonus\n\nand that he owes Mother 20% of that bonus after taxes. We therefore overrule\n\nFather’s ninth issue as to the $65.35 in arrearages.\n\n7. Discretionary order\n\n      In Father’s tenth issue, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby allowing Mother to purchase a van specially equipped to transport W.M.R.’s\n\nwheelchair and by requiring Father to pay half of those expenses. Specifically,\n\nFather complains that there is no reasonableness requirement or some other\n\nmechanism that limits Mother’s ability to incur expenses for which Father would\n\nbe liable.\n\n      Father offers no cases to support this argument.          However, there are\n\nnumerous cases in which the court upheld a child support order requiring one\n\nparent to pay for unquantifiable expenses.

Agreed Offsets\n\n      In his eleventh issue, Father argues that the trial court did not credit Father\n\nwith the agreed offset of $1,000 for the annuity payments W.M.R. receives. First,\n\nthere is no evidence that the trial court did not credit Father for the offset. The\n\ntrial court’s award matches exactly the amount Mother calculated in the summary\n\nshe provided to the court. Mother’s summary credits Father with $1,000 a month\n\nbeginning at W.M.R.’s eighteenth birthday.       Secondly, we sustained Father’s\n\nissue regarding the arrearage based on his commissions and reformed the\n\ncumulative money judgment to $65.35 (20% of Father’s $500 bonus, net after\n\ntaxes), which was not subject to a reduction. We therefore overrule Father’s\n\neleventh issue.\n\n9. Trial amendment\n\n      In Father’s twelfth issue, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby not permitting his trial amendment, which he argues was necessary to\n\ncomport the pleadings with the proof adduced at trial.          Specifically, Father\n\nfocuses on his request to include an affirmative defense that Mother’s claim is\n\ntime barred by a four-year statute of limitations. The trial court held its hearing\n\non February 7, 2011, March 10, 2011, and May 13, 2011. Father filed his motion\n\nfor leave to amend his pleadings on June 29, 2011.            Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 63 states that parties may amend their pleadings after trial by leave of\n\nthe court “unless there is a showing that such filing will operate as a surprise to\n\nthe opposite party.”   Tex.

The decision to allow or deny the\n\n\n                                        24\n\famendment rests with the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial court’s\n\ndecision will not be overturned unless it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.\n\nG.R.A.V.I.T.Y.

In Krishnan, the appellate court\n\nupheld the trial court’s decision to allow a post-trial amendment because the\n\n“appellant did not make any showing to the trial court that her settlement strategy\n\n\n                                        25\n\for her trial posture would have changed knowing that she risked full range\n\nexposure at trial. She has not shown evidence of surprise or prejudice.” Id. In\n\nKrishnan, the appellant contended that she was prejudiced because “the\n\namended pleadings exposed her to a full claim instead of the two-thirds claim\n\nand her settlement strategy would have been greatly influenced by knowing that\n\nshe risked full range exposure at trial.”    Id.   Krishnan, however, is not fully\n\nsupportive of Father’s argument for two reasons. First, the appellee in Krishnan\n\nsought to amend his pleadings during the trial, while here Father sought an\n\namendment forty-seven days after three hearings were concluded.             See id.\n\nSecond, in Krishnan the appellee was not seeking to add a new cause of action\n\nor defense while here, Father has sought to add numerous new causes of action.\n\nSee id.\n\n      Father also argues that Mother only offered general, conclusory, non-\n\nspecific contentions of being surprised or prejudiced; she did not offer a\n\nsupporting affidavit for her objection, and no witnesses were called at the hearing\n\ntestifying to specific facts to support her surprise or prejudice. Father, however,\n\ndoes not cite any case law to support this argument that Mother must prove any\n\nof these things to substantiate her surprise or prejudice. To the contrary, Mother\n\nonly had to object to the trial amendment alleging surprise or prejudice, because\n\nin a situation where “the amendment would reshape the cause of action,\n\nprejudicing the opposing party . . . the opposing party’s objection is sufficient to\n\nshow surprise.” Hakemy Bros., 189 S.W.3d at 924; see Chapin & Chapin, 844\n\n\n                                        26\n\fS.W.2d at 665 (“A party opposing a trial amendment does not have to prove\n\nprejudice or surprise if the amendment is a substantive one which changes the\n\nnature of the trial.”); Greenhalgh, 787 S.W.2d at 940 (“A newly plead affirmative\n\ndefense substantially changes the nature of a trial unlike adding a verified plea\n\nconforming to issues already pleaded, amending the amount of damages\n\nclaimed.”).

This evidence\n\nincluded the annuity payment that W.M.R. receives in the amount of $1,000 a\n\nmonth. This amount, however, is not sufficient to cover all of W.M.R.’s monthly\n\nexpenses.

Mother’s estimation included items that Father was already\n\nresponsible for paying, such as medical expenses. It was reasonable for the trial\n\ncourt to reduce Mother’s estimation by those expenses and then order Father to\n\npay half of the reduced amount.

Specifically, Father makes two arguments: (1) that Mother failed to\n\nintroduce any evidence that the hourly rates charged by her attorneys were\n\nreasonable; and (2) Mother’s attorney’s fees should not be allowed because the\n\nfees were not segregated between the enforcement action and the modification\n\naction.\n\n      The trial court has broad discretion in awarding attorney’s fees in family\n\nlaw matters that involve the parent-child relationship.
