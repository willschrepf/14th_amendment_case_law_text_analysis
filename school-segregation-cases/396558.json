See Manning v. Sch. Bd. of Hillsborough\n\nCounty, Fla., 24 F.Supp.2d 1277 (M.D. Fla.), mot. to alter or amend den., mot. for\n\nclarification granted in part, 28 F.Supp.2d 1353 (M.D. Fla. 1998). Appellants argue\n\nthat they have eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable\n\nand have fully complied in good faith with the desegregation decree. Accordingly,\n\nAppellants claim their school district should be declared unitary and federal judicial\n\nsupervision should cease. Conversely, Appellees, a class of African-American\n\nschoolchildren, contend the school district is not unitary and federal judicial oversight\n\nof Appellants remains necessary. We hold that Appellants have achieved unitary\n\nstatus. We reverse and remand for the district court to enter judgment, in accordance\n\nwith this opinion, declaring the Hillsborough County school system to be unitary.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Procedural History\n\n      Appellants for many years operated a racially-segregated, dual school system.\n\nAs a result of the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education\n\nof Topeka, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954) (Brown I), Appellees in 1958 filed this\n\n\n                                           2\n\fclass-action lawsuit on behalf of all “minor Negro children and their parents” residing\n\nin Appellants’ school district.1 In 1962, the district court found that Appellants, by\n\noperating a segregated school system, had violated the Fourteenth Amendment. For\n\nthe next eight and half years, the district court issued various orders as part of its\n\nefforts to remedy the harm caused by Appellants’ unconstitutional conduct. See, e.g.,\n\nMannings v. Bd. of Pub. Instruction of Hillsborough County, Fla., 306 F. Supp. 497\n\n(M.D. Fla. 1969).\n\n       1\n           The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of Florida. In 1962, the Middle District\nof Florida was created, and the case was transferred to that court’s docket on November 2, 1962.\nIn a May 1971 order, the presiding district judge noted that this case was — in 1971 — the\noldest active case on the docket of the Middle District of Florida. Of course, the same holds true\ntoday.\n         The Honorable Thurgood Marshall, prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court,\nserved as one of the attorneys for Appellees. The lead plaintiff was, and still is, Andrew L.\nManning; through the many years of litigation, his surname has frequently, and incorrectly, been\nspelled “Mannings.” The institutional defendant was formerly known as the Board of Public\nInstruction of Hillsborough County.\n         The following are the published opinions arising from this case: Mannings v. Bd. of Pub.\nInstruction of Hillsborough County, Fla. 277 F.2d 370 (5th Cir. 1960); Mannings v. Bd. of Pub.\nInstruction of Hillsborough County, Fla., 306 F. Supp. 497 (M.D. Fla. 1969); Mannings v. Bd. of\nPub. Instruction of Hillsborough County, Fla., 427 F.2d 874 (5th Cir. 1970); Mannings v. Sch.\nBd. of Hillsborough County, Fla., 796 F.Supp. 1491 (M.D. Fla. 1992); Mannings v. Sch.

Bd. of\nHillsborough County, Fla., 1999 WL 786373 (M.D. Fla. 1999). Additionally, a law review\narticle is devoted exclusively to this litigation. See Drew S. Days, III, The Other Desegregation\nStory: Eradicating the Dual School System in Hillsborough County, Florida, 61 Fordham L.\nRev. 33 (1992).\n\n                                                3\n\f      In 1970, our predecessor court examined whether Appellants had sufficiently\n\neradicated the illegal dual school system such that it could be found “unitary.” See\n\nMannings v. Bd. of Pub. Instruction of Hillsborough County, Fla., 427 F.2d 874 (5th\n\nCir. 1970). Relying upon the six so-called Green2 factors, the former Fifth Circuit\n\nconcluded that, with regard to three factors (transportation, extracurricular activities,\n\nand facilities), Appellants had indeed achieved a unitary school district.                See\n\nMannings, 427 F.2d at 878. Nonetheless, based on its examination of three other\n\nfactors (faculty desegregation, staff desegregation, and student assignments), the court\n\nfound Appellants had fallen short and had not attained unitary status. See id. The\n\ncase was remanded to the district court with instructions to remedy the deficiencies.\n\nSee id.\n\n      After remand, the Supreme Court, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board\n\nof Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S. Ct. 1267 (1971), gave firm guidance on a district\n\ncourt’s equitable power to remedy illegal segregation. On May 11, 1971, just 21 days\n\nafter Swann was decided, the district court directed Appellants to submit a\n\ncomprehensive desegregation plan that conformed with the requirements of Swann.\n\nThereafter, Appellants submitted such a plan, and the district court adopted the plan\n\nin its order dated July 2, 1971 (the July 1971 Order). From 1971 to 1991, the district\n\n\n      2\n          Green v. County Sch. Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S. Ct. 1689 (1968).\n\n                                               4\n\fcourt’s supervision of Appellants was governed, with some minor modifications,\n\nexclusively by the July 1971 Order.3\n\n      In 1991, Appellants and Appellees entered into a consent decree (1991 Consent\n\nOrder). The primary reason for the 1991 Consent Order was to enable Appellants to\n\nreorganize the school district, so as to eliminate single grade centers and to create\n\nmiddle schools. The 1991 Consent Order, which was to be implemented over a 7-year\n\nperiod, did not annul the July 1971 Order, but merely modified it.\n\n      Appellee moved in 1994 to enforce the 1991 Consent Order. The matter was\n\nreferred to the magistrate judge who recommended denying the motion. The district\n\njudge, however, deferred ruling on the motion and sua sponte recommitted the matter\n\nto the magistrate judge to consider whether the school district had become unitary,\n\nthereby removing the need for federal judicial oversight.\n\n      In October 1996, the magistrate judge conducted a 7-day hearing, at which both\n\nsides presented considerable evidence. In August 1997, the magistrate judge issued\n\na detailed report and recommendation wherein she recommended the district court\n\nfind that Appellants had achieved unitary status and thus should be released from\n\nfederal judicial supervision. Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district judge\n\nin a 110-page order dated October 26, 1998, rejected in part and adopted in part the\n\n\n      3\n          For a summary of the minor modifications, see infra note 6.\n\n                                                5\n\fmagistrate judge’s report and recommendation. See Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1277-\n\n1335. The district judge concluded that Appellants had not attained unitary status and\n\ntherefore federal judicial supervision was still warranted.4 See Manning, 24 F.Supp.\n\n2d at 1335. Within ten days of the order dated October 26, 1998, Appellants filed a\n\nmotion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). The district\n\ncourt, in a 13-page order, denied the motion on December 4, 1998. See Manning, 28\n\nF.Supp.2d at 1361. Within 30 days, Appellants filed a notice of appeal as to the\n\ndistrict judge’s orders of October 26, 1998, and December 4, 1998.\n\nB. Facts\n\n       To analyze this case that has endured for over 40 years, we first summarize the\n\ncontents of the July 1971 Order and the 1991 Consent Order, which, with minor\n\nmodifications, have served as the guideposts for Appellants’ journey toward a unitary\n\nschool district. Then, we set forth the district court’s most recent factual findings with\n\nrespect to Appellants’ unitary status.\n\n       1. July 1971 Order\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          Before the district court, Appellees also argued that, even if the school district were\nunitary, this status would not constitute a “changed circumstance” warranting a modification or\nvacation of the 1991 Consent Order. See Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1287-88 (citing Rufo v.\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S. Ct. 748 (1992)). The district court rejected\nAppellees’ argument. See id. at 1288. Since Appellees do not contest this ruling on appeal, we\ndo not address it.\n\n                                                6\n\f      As previously discussed, the district court ordered Appellants in May of 1971\n\nto submit a comprehensive desegregation plan. The district court stated that the\n\n“primary objective” of the plan should be the abolition of segregation. In particular,\n\nthe district court sought to eliminate, at every school, racial balances where black\n\nstudents comprised more than 50% of the student population. The district court\n\nfurther stated that the “most acceptable and desirable” result would be a white/black\n\nratio of 86%/14% in senior high schools, 80%/20% in junior high schools, and\n\n79%/21% in elementary schools.\n\n       The July 1971 Order, which ratified Appellants’ proposed desegregation plan,\n\ndealt primarily with student assignments in grades one through twelve.                        For\n\nelementary schools, the plan clustered each predominately black school with two to\n\nfive predominantly white schools. The white schools would be used for grades one\n\nthrough five and would be integrated with black children from “satellite zones”5 who\n\nhad previously attended the black school in the cluster. The black school in each\n\ncluster would be used as a sixth-grade center and would be integrated with white\n\nchildren who had previously attended the white schools in the cluster.\n\n      For junior high schools, each black school would be clustered with one to three\n\nwhite schools. The black schools would be used for seventh grade, and the white\n\n\n      5\n          A satellite zone is an area not contiguous with the main attendance zone for the school.\n\n                                                7\n\fschools would be used for eighth and ninth grades. Again, the schools would be\n\nintegrated with students from satellite zones. For senior high schools, the two black\n\nschools would be closed, but their facilities would be used for junior high schools.\n\nThrough a series of re-zoning and satellite busing measures, the white high schools\n\nwould be integrated.\n\n       With regard to faculty and staff, the district court had previously entered an\n\norder on August 25, 1970. In the July 1971 Order, the court found that no additional\n\nmeasures were necessary, and it directed Appellants to continue to abide by the\n\nAugust 25, 1970, order. With respect to transportation, facilities, and extracurricular\n\nactivities, the July 1971 Order directed Appellants to comply with all previous orders.\n\nThe order also mandated that all operations relating to these areas should be conducted\n\nin a non-discriminatory manner and should be regularly re-examined by Appellants.\n\n       The July 1971 Order also remarked on four other topics: (1) majority to\n\nminority transfers, (2) other transfer rules, (3) the bi-racial committee, and\n\n(4) approval of site locations. Specifically, the district court stated, “Each of these has\n\nbeen required by previous orders of this Court. Some of them may not be required if\n\n[Appellants’] plan is effectuated and accomplished.” Nevertheless, the district court\n\nstated that it was “retaining jurisdiction and [would] require the continuation of all of\n\nthese procedures to be available and used as necessary.”\n\n\n                                            8\n\f      Attached to the July 1971 Order were two exhibits which explained the bi-racial\n\ncommittee, majority-to-minority transfers, and other transfer rules. The bi-racial\n\ncommittee was to serve as an advisory body on a number of issues and was to consist\n\nof ten members, with Appellants and Appellees each selecting five members. In some\n\ninstances, the committee was to receive reports about students transferring from their\n\nassigned schools. In other instances, Appellants were barred from approving student\n\ntransfers before considering a recommendation from the committee.\n\n      Concerning majority-to-minority transfers, the attached exhibits stated the\n\nfollowing:\n\n      Majority to minority transfer – Any student shall be permitted to transfer\n      from a school in which his race is in the majority in order to attend the\n      closest school to his residence in which his race is in the minority.\n      ....\n      The transfer forms shall be available at each public school in\n      Hillsborough County and the County School offices.\n      ....\n      The transferee is to be given priority for space and thus the transfer is not\n      to be dependent on space being available.\n\n      Transportation will be provided by the School Board in service or in\n      kind to the school to which the transfer is made if that school is more\n      than two miles from the home.\n\n      In conclusion, the July 1971 Order stated that Appellants’ desegregation plan\n\n“fully complie[d] with the [district] [c]ourt’s order of May 11, 1971,\" and that it\n\nwould “result in the establishment of a unitary school system in Hillsborough County,\n\n\n                                           9\n\fFlorida.” The July 1971 Order noted, however, that Appellants had a “continuing\n\nresponsibility” to ensure the plan would be effectuated. Moreover, each year\n\nfollowing the implementation of the July 1971 Order, Appellants filed two reports per\n\nyear with the district court and provided copies to Appellees. Lastly, the July 1971\n\nOrder retained jurisdiction in the district court for “such further action as may be\n\nnecessary and required.”\n\n       2. 1991 Consent Order\n\n       Between 1971 and 1991, the modifications to the July 1971 Order were minor.6\n\nBy 1991, however, Appellants had determined, based upon a comprehensive study,\n\nthat the school district would benefit if middle schools (grades 6-8) were established.\n\nTo accomplish this, the July 1971 Order had to be modified, because that order had\n\nrelied extensively on single-grade centers (grades 6 and 7) to desegregate the school\n\ndistrict. Thus, Appellants entered into negotiations with Appellees, and the product\n\nof those negotiations was the 1991 Consent Order.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          The modifications included, inter alia: changes in transfer rules for children of school\nemployees; approval of a new high school site; changes in academic transfer rules; the closure of\ncertain schools; and the creation of magnet schools. Perhaps, the most significant modification\ndealt with Lee Elementary School, which by 1974 had a black population in excess of 50%. To\ncorrect this imbalance, Appellants, pursuant to the district court’s order, converted Lee to a\nsixth-grade center and transferred the former Lee students (first through fifth graders) to seven\nother elementary schools.\n\n                                               10\n\f       The centerpiece of the 1991 Consent Order was the Middle School Task Force\n\nReport 3 of July 1991 (hereinafter “Task Force Report”), which the district court\n\nincorporated into the consent order.7 The Task Force Report was presented to the\n\nschool board by a 12-person committee. This committee included Mr. Henry Carley,\n\nPresident of the Tampa Branch of the NAACP. In addition, a legal committee,\n\nconsisting of, inter alia, Mr. Al Davis of the NAACP, reviewed the Task Force\n\nReport, and Appellees’ own desegregation expert, Dr. Leonard Stevens, was involved\n\nin shaping the Task Force Report. Furthermore, the Task Force Report included two\n\nseparate position statements prepared by various African-American community\n\ngroups (Howard W. Blake Alumni Group, Coalition of African American\n\nOrganizations, Greater Tampa Urban League, Inc., and Beta Sigma Zeta Chapter of\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority). In sum, as the 1991 Consent Order explained, the Task Force\n\nReport was the result of “extensive discussions” between Appellants and Appellees,\n\nand the discussions were designed to “to ensure . . . that plans for the implementation\n\nof the [Task Force Report] were formulated in a manner that addressed the interests\n\nand concerns of [Appellees].”\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        The parties and the district court use interchangeably the terms “Task Force Report”\nand “Middle School Plan.” For the sake of simplicity, we use solely the term Task Force Report.\n\n                                              11\n\f      The Task Force Report proposed substantial changes to the structure of the\n\nschool system. Under the July 1971 Order, the school system generally had consisted\n\nof five tiers: elementary schools (grades K-5), sixth-grade centers, seventh-grade\n\ncenters, junior high schools (grades 8-9), and high schools (grades 10-12). In contrast,\n\nthe Task Force Report called for a three-tier school system: elementary schools\n\n(grades K-5); middle schools (grades 6-8); and high schools (grades 9-12). This new\n\nstructure would be achieved through a so-called “cluster model,” under which 17\n\nclusters would be formed. For each cluster, the high school would serve as the “basic\n\nunit” and its students would be drawn from “feeder” middle and elementary schools.\n\nThe Task Force Report estimated that it would take five to seven years to implement\n\nthe cluster model.\n\n      The cluster model proposed by Task Force Report was undoubtedly the most\n\nsubstantial change to the structure of the school system since the July 1971 Order.\n\nThe objective of July 1971 Order had been to desegregate the school system. By\n\ncontrast, one of the primary objectives of the Task Force Report was “to maintain a\n\ndesegregated school system.” (emphasis added). In an apparent attempt to meet this\n\nobjective, the 1991 Consent Order directed Appellants “to minimize (to the extent\n\npracticable) the number of schools which deviate from the system-wide student\n\nenrollment [race] ratios.”     Moreover, the 1991 Consent Order assumed that\n\n\n                                          12\n\fintervening demographic changes might necessitate future modifications in student\n\nassignments in order to maintain a desegregated school district.8\n\n       To further the goal of maintaining desired race ratios, the Task Force Report\n\nattempted to project the race ratios at each school after the cluster plan’s\n\nimplementation. In summary, the Task Force Report predicted:\n\n       The number of schools reflecting a ten or higher percent race ratio\n       variance [from the recommended ratio of 20/80%] will increase from 36\n       to 46. The plan also increases the number of schools from 56 to 72 that\n       will have an almost perfectly balanced race ratio with a student variance\n       of five percent or less from the recommended ratio of 20/80% ratio.\n\nAppendix 1 of the Task Force Report provided more detail as to the projected racial\n\nbalance at each school. Fourteen schools were projected to have a 40% or greater\n\nblack population,9 and an additional four schools were projected to have a 39% black\n\npopulation.10 These projections, as part of the Task Force Report, were incorporated\n\ninto the 1991 Consent Order — a consent decree to which Appellees were parties.\n\n\n\n       8\n           This assumption was wrong as a matter of law. External factors which are not the\nresult of segregation and are beyond a school board’s control should not be part of the remedial\ncalculus when shaping a federal desegregation decree. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70,\n102, 115 S. Ct. 2038, 2055-56 (1995) (citing Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S.\n424, 434, 96 S. Ct. 2697, 2703-04 (1976)); infra Part II.B.1.\n       9\n         The 14 schools, with their projected race ratios, were as follows: Lomax (94%),\nEdison (64%), Sulphur Springs (59%), Graham (58%), Oak Park (58%), Cleveland (50%),\nFranklin (47%), Sligh (46%), Lockhart (45%), Palm River (41%), West Tampa (41%), Shaw\n(41%), B.T. Washington (40%), Witter (40%).\n       10\n            The four schools were Foster, Bing, Dowdell, and Just.\n\n                                                13\n\f       Along with projecting race ratios, the Task Force Report instituted a variety of\n\nprograms designed to maintain a desegregated school system. For example, the report\n\nimplemented magnet programs,11 which were designed in part “to reduce minority\n\nisolation” and “to promote desegregation in schools.”12 The report also suggested a\n\nmulti-cultural curriculum for students in all grades and instructional sessions to enable\n\nstaff to deal with diverse populations.\n\n       One omission in the Task Force Report, however, is particularly noteworthy in\n\nlight of subsequent events: majority-to-minority transfers. Although they had been\n\ndiscussed briefly in the July 1971 Order, majority-to-minority transfers were not\n\nmentioned once in the 37-page Task Force Report, nor in the 8 attached appendices,\n\nnor in the 1991 Consent Order. Dr. Stevens — Appellees’ desegregation expert who\n\nhelped shape the Task Force Report — admitted at the 1996 evidentiary hearing that\n\nmajority-to-minority transfers would have been insignificant in alleviating the racial\n\nimbalances in the school district.\n\n       3. Factual Findings\n\n\n\n\n       11\n         The magnet programs were intended to supplement a traditional curriculum with a\nfocus on special “themes”, such as computers and technology or visual and performing arts.\n       12\n          In addition, the “racial composition targets for magnet school populations [was] not\n[to] exceed 40% black.”\n\n                                               14\n\f       The magistrate judge, in her 1997 report and recommendation, structured her\n\nfactual findings around the six Green factors,13 plus a seventh factor, quality of\n\neducation, which has been used by some courts to evaluate a school district’s unitary\n\nstatus. See, e.g., Mills v. Freeman, 942 F.Supp. 1449, 1460 (N.D. Ga. 1996), aff’d,\n\n118 F.3d 727 (11th Cir. 1997). In addition, the magistrate judge made factual findings\n\nregarding Appellants’ good-faith compliance with past desegregation decrees, as\n\nrequired by Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 250, 111\n\nS. Ct. 630, 638 (1991), and its progeny. Based on all of these findings, the magistrate\n\njudge recommended the school district be declared unitary in all respects and that\n\nfederal judicial supervision of the school district be terminated.\n\n       The district judge found that the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation\n\nwas “comprehensive” and “agree[d] with a majority of the [m]agistrate [j]udge’s\n\nanalysis.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1287. For six of the seven factors (faculty, staff,\n\ntransportation, extracurricular activities, facilities and resource allocation, and quality\n\nof education), the district judge adopted most, if not all, of the magistrate judge’s\n\nfindings.14 See id. at 1316-34. In their brief to this Court, Appellees do not contest\n\n\n       13\n           Those six factors are student assignments, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular\nactivities, and facilities and resource allocation. See Green, 391 U.S. at 435, 88 S. Ct. at 1693.\n       14\n           Regarding these six factors, the district judge’s order is less than clear. After a\nthorough review, however, we are convinced that the district judge overruled most, and possibly\nall, of Appellees’ objections to the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation. The\n\n                                                 15\n\fthe findings related to these six factors, and thus further elaboration is unnecessary\n\nexcept to emphasize that the findings support a declaration of unitary status.\n\n       With regard to the remaining Green factor (student assignments), the district\n\njudge expressed some disagreement with the magistrate judge. The district judge also\n\ndiffered with the magistrate judge’s finding on Appellants’ good-faith compliance.\n\nAs we discuss in Part II, the district judge used an incorrect legal standard. As a\n\nresult, the district judge’s legal conclusion, though based mostly upon the magistrate\n\njudge’s factual findings, was erroneous. To help illuminate our discussion in Part II,\n\nwe narrate below the magistrate judge’s factual findings related to student assignments\n\nand Appellants’ good faith, and we highlight, when necessary, particular findings\n\nadopted by the district judge. We also note those few areas where the district judge\n\nrejected the factual findings of the magistrate judge.\n\n               a. Student Assignments\n\n       As of the 1995-96 school year, the Hillsborough County school district\n\nconsisted of approximately 120,000 students, 108 elementary schools, 27 junior high\n\nschools, and 15 senior high schools. Relying on a standard proposed by Appellees’\n\nand Appellants’ experts, the magistrate judge designated any school with a\n\n\n\n\nobjections sustained by the district judge, if any, are inconsequential to our ultimate holding in\nthis case.\n\n                                                 16\n\fblack/white ratio varying plus or minus 20 points from a 20/80 ratio as being “racially\n\nidentifiable” or “racially imbalanced.”15 It was undisputed that, by the 1971-72 school\n\nyear, all schools were desegregated. Furthermore, the evidence showed that, at the\n\ntime of the 1996 evidentiary hearing, approximately 90% of the schools were not\n\nracially identifiable. Appellees, however, identified 17 schools as racially identifiable\n\n\n\n\n       15\n          Since the parties agree on what constitutes a racially identifiable school, we shall\naccept their definition for purposes of this case and this case only. We pass no judgment on the\ncorrectness of this definition.\n\n                                               17\n\fand made these schools the focus of the 1996 evidentiary hearing.16 Ironically, of\n\nthese 17 schools, 9 were among the 14 schools that the Task Force Report projected\n\n\n         16\n           Both the district judge and the magistrate judge referred to 16 schools. A review of\nthe Joint Pre-Evidentiary Hearing Statement and the report by Appellees’ expert reveals that\nAppellees challenged the racial identifiability of 17 schools. Both the district judge and the\nmagistrate judge omitted Mort Elementary from their findings. This oversight, however, is of no\nsignificance. The following are the percentages of black students at each of these 17 challenged\nschools during the 1972-73 and 1995-96 school years:\n\n School                                  Percentage of Black       Percentage of Black\n                                         Students, 1972-73         Students, 1995-96\n Robles                                  24%                       91%\n Edison                                  36%                       77%\n Sulphur Springs                         19%                       74%\n Oak Park                                23%                       69%\n Graham                                  35%                       67%\n Foster                                  21%                       61%\n Cleveland                               26%                       58%\n Shaw                                    15%                       57%\n Witter                                  18%                       54%\n Cahoon                                  21%                       53%\n Clair Mel                               18%                       49%\n West Tampa                              14%                       47%\n DeSoto                                  35%                       43%\n Mort                                    N/A                       43%\n Van Buren                               17%                       53%\n Sligh                                   20%                       50%\n Dowdell                                 14%                       48%\n\n\n                                               18\n\fwould have a 40% or greater black population, and two were among the four schools\n\nthat the Task Force Report projected would have a 39% black population.17\n\nImmediately after the July 1971 Order was implemented, all of these schools became\n\nracially balanced.18\n\n       The critical factual question at the evidentiary hearing was whether the racial\n\nimbalances at the 17 schools were caused by Appellants’ past de jure segregation (or\n\nother discriminatory conduct), or whether, instead, the racial imbalances were caused\n\nby nondiscriminatory factors and circumstances. In a joint statement submitted prior\n\nto the evidentiary hearing, Appellants contended that demographic shifts had caused\n\nthe schools to become racially identifiable. In the same joint statement, Appellees did\n\nnot directly rebut Appellants’ contention, but instead argued that “[d]emographic\n\nchange alone does not account for the racial identifiability in the Hillsborough County\n\nschool system.” (emphasis added).\n\n       To resolve their factual dispute, the parties presented considerable evidence to\n\nthe magistrate judge, including, inter alia, reports on attendance boundaries,\n\ndemographic reports, and expert testimony. We need not repeat all this evidence here,\n\nas it is fully set forth in the opinion of the district court. See Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d\n\n       17\n            Compare supra notes 9, 10 with supra note 16.\n       18\n         One school, Mort, was not listed in the 1971 report submitted by Appellants and thus\npresumably did not exist at that time.\n\n                                               19\n\fat 1290-1312. Instead, we compare the findings of the magistrate judge to those of\n\nthe district judge.\n\n       The magistrate judge, in her report and recommendation, recounted the expert\n\ntestimony of Dr. David Armor, one of Appellants’ experts — testimony that the\n\nmagistrate judge personally observed. Dr. Armor explained that he reviewed the\n\nextensive demographic data contained in a report by Dr. W.A.V. Clark, another of\n\nAppellants’ experts. Based on this evidence, Dr. Armor opined on the witness stand\n\nthat “none of the schools that were currently imbalanced . . . were caused by\n\n[Appellants’] action[s,]” but rather such imbalances “were caused by demographics.”\n\nThe magistrate judge also reviewed the testimony of Dr. Fred Shelley, Appellees’\n\ndemographic expert — once again, testimony that the magistrate judge personally\n\nobserved. Dr. Shelley did not conduct his own demographic study, but rather relied\n\non the data supplied by Dr. Clark (Appellants’ expert). Dr. Shelley opined “that it is\n\nperhaps difficult to conclude that [the] increase in racial imbalance is attributable\n\nsolely to the processes of natural demographic change.” In the end, the magistrate\n\njudge agreed with Dr. Armor and found that demographic change is the “most likely\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\fexplanation” for the racial imbalances. The magistrate judge faulted Dr. Shelley for\n\nnot providing an alternative explanation for the racial imbalances.19\n\n       The district judge, though not observing any of the testimony, agreed for the\n\nmost part with the findings of the magistrate judge. In conformity with Dr. Armor’s\n\nopinion (and the magistrate judge’s finding), the district judge found that “[t]here\n\n[was] no indication that the racial identity of the schools in Hillsborough County has\n\nbeen deliberately caused by segregative policies or practices by [Appellants]” and that\n\n“based on the totality of the evidence, a shift in demographics [was] a substantial\n\ncause of the racial identifiability in Hillsborough County’s schools.” Manning, 24\n\nF.Supp.2d at 1303, 1310. The district judge likewise was unable to cite, in either of\n\nher two orders, any independent demographic evidence put forward by Appellees or\n\nan alternative explanation proffered by Dr. Shelley as to the cause of the racial\n\nimbalances.\n\n\n       19\n           In his report, Dr. Shelley did not attempt to link the present racial imbalances with past\nde jure segregation, but rather merely tried to prove that demographics alone did not cause the\nupsurge in racially identifiable schools. At the evidentiary hearing, when asked how his report\ndiffered from Dr. Clark’s report, Dr. Shelley responded:\n        My reaction to the report was that, while I thought the demographic analysis was\n        very good, what I felt was missing in the report was how to reason from the\n        analysis of the demographic change that was undertaken to a conclusion that\n        demographic change was the sole cause of the observed racial imbalance in the\n        public schools in Hillsborough County.\nTr. of Evidentiary Hearing on October 24, 1996, Vol. 4, at 66 (emphasis added). Dr. Shelley\nexpressed doubts that “one can conclude without ambiguity that [the racial] imbalance is caused\nonly by natural demographic changes.” Id. at 66-67 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                 21\n\f      The district judge seemed to have adopted in toto Appellants’ theory of the case\n\n(and the magistrate judge’s finding). As the district judge stated time and time again,\n\na shift in demographics was a substantial or significant cause of the racial imbalances,\n\nand Appellants did not deliberately cause the racial imbalances. See id. at 1293\n\n(stating “that the racial imbalances in the schools [were] not the result of a deliberate\n\nattempt by [Appellants] to affect or alter demographic patterns to affect the racial\n\ncomposition of the schools”); id. at 1311 (finding “the evidence presented by the\n\nparties establishes that a shift in demographics played a significant role in the racial\n\ncompositions of the schools” and that Appellants had “not ‘affirmatively’ exacerbated\n\nracial imbalances”); Manning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1356 (stating that “demographics have\n\nplayed a significant role in Hillsborough County”). The district judge even agreed\n\nthat “[i]t [was] probable that” the 17 challenged “schools would have become racially\n\nimbalanced regardless of [Appellants’] efforts.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1303.\n\nEven Appellees’ own expert, according to the district judge, “agreed that\n\ndemographics have played a significant role in Hillsborough County.” Id. Despite\n\nall of the evidence showing that demographics, and not de jure segregation, caused\n\nthe racial imbalances, the district judge ultimately declined to find the school district\n\nunitary as to student assignments. The district judge declined to so find because she\n\ncould not conclude that demographics were the sole cause of the racial imbalances.\n\n\n                                           22\n\fSee id. at 1302. In the district judge’s view, therefore, the legal presumption remained\n\nthat any racial imbalances were the result of the prior de jure segregation. See\n\nManning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1357.\n\n            Finally, we note that the district judge’s findings were inconsistent and\n\ndifficult to follow. For example, the district judge was concerned by Dr. Clark’s data,\n\nespecially with regard to its reliability.20 See Manning, 24 F. Supp.2d at 1298-1300.\n\nNevertheless, the district judge never stated that the data — which both sides relied\n\nupon —        was so unreliable so as to undermine her finding that “a shift in\n\ndemographics [was] a substantial cause of the racial identifiability in Hillsborough\n\nCounty’s schools.” Id. at 1303. Additionally, the district judge remarked that she was\n\n“not convinced that a shift in demographics explain[ed] the racial imbalance in the\n\nHillsborough County school system.” Manning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1356; see also\n\n\n\n       20\n         In particular, the district judge noted the following:\n      [Appellants’] statistics encompass a larger segment of the population than is\n      useful to explain the deviations in the racial compositions of the unbalanced\n      schools. Specifically, [Appellants] rely on Dr. Clark’s use of school-aged children\n      from ages 0-17 to explain enrollment ratios at the elementary schools; however,\n      almost one-half of the children included in this group would not, in fact, be\n      attending an elementary school. Moreover, while a few blocks in an attendance\n      zone may reflect black school-age populations as high as 95%, those few blocks\n      only represent a small proportion of the entire attendance zone. Finally, Dr.\n      Clark's analysis does not address [Appellants'] initial decisions to draw attendance\n      zones, decisions not to act when it was apparent that those zones were\n      inappropriate, or other School Board decisions, such as, location of new schools,\n      or implementation (or lack thereof) of desegregation tools.\nManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1298.\n\n                                               23\n\fManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1293. Yet, in the very same sentence, the district judge also\n\nstated that “demographics have played a significant role in Hillsborough County.”\n\nManning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1356. In spite of these inconsistencies, we are convinced\n\nthat the district judge agreed with the magistrate judge and found that shifting\n\ndemographics was a substantial cause of the racial imbalances in Appellants’ student\n\nassignments and that Appellants did not deliberately cause the racial imbalances.\n\n      b. Good-Faith Compliance\n\n      The magistrate judge concluded that Appellants had complied in good faith\n\nwith past federal desegregation decrees, as required by Dowell and its progeny. 498\n\nU.S. at 249-50, 111 S. Ct. at 638. The magistrate judge’s conclusion was based\n\nlargely on the testimony given during the 7-day evidentiary hearing by a variety of\n\nwitnesses, including inter alia: Dr. Walter Sickles, the school superintendent from\n\n1989 to 1996; Dr. Earl Lennard, the school superintendent as of 1996; five members\n\nof the school board; Doris Reddick, the chair of the school board; Andrew Manning,\n\nthe lead plaintiff in the case since its inception; and Joanna Tokley, the president and\n\nCEO of the Urban League.\n\n      Dr. Sickles, who had been an employee of the school board since 1969, testified\n\nthat he believed the school district was unitary in the early 1990's. Dr. Sickles did not\n\nseek a declaration of unitary status at that time because he believed Appellees would\n\n\n                                           24\n\fhave opposed and impeded his effort to establish middle schools, which was his top\n\npriority. Instead, Dr. Sickles sought Appellees’ cooperation in establishing middle\n\nschools via the Task Force Report and the 1991 Consent Order. Dr. Lennard, an\n\nemployee of the school board since 1964, testified that he felt a “moral and legal\n\nobligation on the school system to continue a desegregated school system.” Five\n\nschool board members “expressed no misgivings about . . . the intent and ability of the\n\nSchool Board to continue a desegregated school system while receiving input from all\n\nmembers of the community.”\n\n      Some witnesses “voice[d] concern about what might happen in the future if\n\n[c]ourt supervision ended.” For instance, Ms. Reddick, the chair of the school board,\n\ntestified against a finding of unitary status. Nevertheless, when asked by Appellees’\n\ncounsel what would happen if the school district were found unitary, Ms. Reddick\n\nasserted, “[W]e’re going to guarantee that students will receive equal education.”\n\n      The magistrate judge found that for more than 25 years Appellants had\n\ncomplied with the court’s orders to desegregate and that not once had Appellants been\n\nfound in violation of any court order. In addition, the magistrate judge noted that\n\nAppellants had “regularly conferred [with Appellees] . . . to ensure that the school\n\nsystem was moving forwards, not backwards, toward compliance with the [c]ourt’s\n\norders.” Accordingly, “the long history of compliance with the [c]ourt’s orders”\n\n\n                                          25\n\foutweighed the “opinions and the anecdotal evidence offered by [Appellees].” In\n\nsum, the magistrate judge concluded, “The testimony of . . . most School Board\n\nmembers, as well as the current superintendent and those responsible for various\n\nfacets of school operation[,] demonstrates that [Appellants] have accepted the\n\nprinciple of racial equality and will not revert back to a dual school system.”\n\n      The district judge, however, did not adopt this finding of good faith. Since the\n\ndistrict judge did not observe any of the testimony from the evidentiary hearing,\n\nnaturally she could not evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. Instead, the district\n\njudge’s finding of bad faith centered upon two interrelated areas of concern:\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\fAppellants’ “apathy” and the lack of a majority-to-minority (MTM) transfer\n\nprogram.21 See Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1293, 1312-14.\n\n       With regard to Appellants’ “apathy,” the district judge faulted Appellants for\n\nnot “utiliz[ing] all available techniques [to desegregate] to the maximum extent\n\npracticable” and for not demonstrating “that they [were] willing to aggressively\n\ndesegregate the school district to the maximum extent practicable.” Id. at 1312, 1335.\n\nAdditionally, the district judge spoke of missed opportunities and a failure to take\n\n“affirmative steps . . . to be released from the [c]ourt’s supervision.” Id. at 1312;\n\n\n       21\n          The district judge and the magistrate judge also extensively discussed some ex parte\ncommunications between a previous presiding judge and school officials . During the\nevidentiary hearing, Dr. John Heur, a retired school board official who had been responsible for\nimplementing the July 1971 Order, testified that such communications occurred between 1972\nand 1974. The magistrate judge found that “[t]hese ex parte conversations, while unfortunate,\nwere not initiated by [Appellants] and do not demonstrate a lack of good faith.” The district\njudge agreed, finding that, “standing alone, the ex parte communications [did] not evidence bad\nfaith.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1315.\n        Additionally, Part II of the October 26, 1998, opinion is titled “Good-Faith” and\ndiscusses Appellants’ magnet programs. See id. at 1314-15. This portion of the opinion is very\nconfusing. It lists the arguments advanced by Appellees regarding magnet schools, but the\nopinion never states whether it is adopting those arguments. In the opinion of December 4,\n1998, the district judge faults Appellants for their failure to develop magnet schools and\nprograms, except for one program at Tampa Bay Technical High School. See Manning, 28\nF.Supp.2d at 1359. But neither opinion ever explains how Appellants’ actions with respect to\nmagnet programs demonstrated bad faith.\n        We therefore conclude that the district judge did not base her finding of bad faith upon\nAppellants’ magnet programs. Even if the district judge did, in fact, base her finding of bad faith\non Appellants’ magnet programs, such a finding would be clearly erroneous. In 1990,\nAppellants moved to designate a magnet school, but Appellees opposed the motion. In\nsuccessfully opposing the motion, Appellees argued that “[t]he basic structure of desegregation\nin [Appellants’] school system has remained constant and effective since 1971,\" and that a\nmagnet program would “introduce more uncertainty about whether schools will remain\ndesegregated.”\n\n                                                27\n\fManning 28 F.Supp.2d at 1359 (citing Lockett v. Bd. of Educ. of Muscogee Sch. Dist.,\n\n92 F.3d 1092, 1099 (11th Cir. 1996) (Lockett I)). Nevertheless, after a request by\n\nAppellants to clarify exactly what steps should be taken to desegregate to the\n\nmaximum extent practicable, see id. at 1355, the district judge declined to give any\n\nspecifics.\n\n      Related to the issue of apathy is the inaction demonstrated by Appellants in\n\ntheir MTM program.       As previously noted, the July 1971 Order directed the\n\nestablishment of an MTM program. See supra Part I.B.1. Under this program, a\n\nstudent who attended a school where his race was the majority would be permitted to\n\ntransfer to a school where his race was the minority. At the evidentiary hearing, Dr.\n\nJohn Miliziano, who was Appellants’ “in-house desegregation expert,” expressed\n\nignorance about the requirement to implement an MTM program:\n\n      I dealt with the Biracial Committee for many years, and no member of\n      the committee ever brought that up. And to tell you the truth, I thought\n      it was one of those things that was considered by the court and it was\n      never meant to apply. It wasn't until recently that I, a person who has\n      spent many, many years in dealing with the court order, maybe it's\n      stupidity on my part, but I didn't even know that this hidden clause —\n      this clause, not hidden, but this clause in the [July 1971 Order] meant\n      really anything.\n\nManning, 24 F. Supp.2d at 1313. The evidence also showed that, from 1977 to 1996,\n\nno student had ever applied for an MTM transfer, and Appellants had not made any\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\feffort to publicize or market the MTM program. See id. at 1314; Manning, 28\n\nF.Supp.2d at 1359.\n\n       While faulting Appellants on the MTM program, the district judge\n\nacknowledged that the July 1971 Order “did not specifically direct [Appellants] to\n\nmarket the [MTM] program.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1314. Furthermore, the\n\ndistrict judge noted (and did not dispute) that no member of the Bi-Racial Committee\n\nand no representative of Appellees had complained, prior to the mid-1990's, about the\n\nnon-availability of an MTM program. See id. at 1313 (quoting testimony of Dr.\n\nMiliziano). The district judge also found that when Appellees did raise the lack of an\n\neffective MTM program, Appellants announced the program “to the [school] district\n\nas a whole and . . . took action to publish information about the program.” Id. at 1312.\n\n       Although the district judge stated that an MTM program is an “indispensable\n\nremedy” and a “useful part of every desegregation plan,”22 id. at 1314, the district\n\njudge did not explain why this particular MTM program was needed to desegregate\n\nthe Hillsborough County school district. In fact, as previously mentioned, Dr. Stevens\n\n— Appellees’ expert who was involved in the negotiations that led to the 1991\n\nConsent Order — conceded that an MTM program would not significantly impact the\n\n       22\n          The district judge lifted this language from the Supreme Court’s opinion in Swann,\n402 U.S. at 26-27, 91 S. Ct. at 1281. In the very same opinion, however, the Supreme Court\nwarned that “[n]o per se rule can adequately embrace all the difficulties of reconciling the\ncompeting interests involved [in desegregating schools].” Id. at 26, 91 S. Ct. at 1281.\n\n                                              29\n\frace ratios at the schools Appellees were challenging as racially imbalanced.\n\nFurthermore, the Task Force Report and the 1991 Consent Order (both of which were\n\napproved by the district judge) failed to even mention the MTM program. Lastly,\n\nnotwithstanding the criticism of the MTM program, the district judge spoke favorably\n\nof Appellants’ overall desegregation efforts. See, e.g., id. at 1287 (stating that\n\n“[u]ndoubtedly, [Appellants’] desegregation efforts demonstrate significant success”);\n\n id. at 1311 (stating Appellants “deserve acknowledgment for their desegregation\n\nefforts thus far”); id. at 1312 (noting Appellants “have been relatively successful in\n\nimplementing desegregation techniques”); id. at 1325 (finding Appellants had acted\n\nin good faith with respect to faculty desegregation and commending Appellants for\n\ntaking recommendations from the Minority Recruitment Task Force).\n\n                                      II. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       Where the relief sought in the district court is the dissolution of an injunction,\n\nthe order of the district court is subject to a mixed standard of review.23 We review\n\n\n       23\n           We raised sua sponte whether appellate jurisdiction existed in this case and requested\nbriefs from the parties. Since this is an appeal of an interlocutory order of the district court\nrefusing to dissolve an injunction, we do possess jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). We\nalso raised sua sponte whether the notice of appeal was timely filed. Appellants timely filed in\nthe district court a motion to alter or amend judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). As such,\nAppellants could file their appeal until 30 days after the district court ruled on the Rule 59(e)\nmotion. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(iv). Since the Appellants complied with this time limit, we\nconclude Appellants timely filed their notice of appeal. Thus, we may hear this appeal.\n\n                                               30\n\ffor abuse of discretion the failure to dissolve an injunction as required by law. See\n\nWilson v. Minor, 220 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir. 2000). The district court’s\n\napplication of law is subject to de novo review, while its findings of fact are subject\n\nto a clearly erroneous standard of review under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). See Sierra Club\n\nv. Martin, 110 F.3d 1551, 1554 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting SunAmerica Corp. v. Sun\n\nLife Assurance Co. of Can., 77 F.3d 1325, 1333) (11th Cir. 1996)). A declaration of\n\na school system’s unitary status is a finding of fact and thus falls under the clearly\n\nerroneous standard of Rule 52(a). See Lockett v. Bd. of Educ. of Muscogee County\n\nSch. Dist., 111 F.3d 839, 841-42 (11th Cir. 1997) (Lockett II); Jacksonville Branch,\n\nNAACP v. Duval County Sch. Bd., 883 F.2d 945, 952 n.3 (11th Cir. 1989). Under this\n\nstandard of review, “[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the\n\n[district court]’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.” Lockett II, 111\n\nF.3d at 842; accord Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S. Ct.\n\n1504, 1511 (1985). But where a district court applies an incorrect legal standard\n\nwhich “taints” or “infects” its findings of facts, such findings “lose the insulation of\n\n[Rule] 52(a) and judgment based thereon cannot stand.” Corley v. Jackson Police\n\nDept., 566 F.2d 994, 1001 (5th Cir. 1978) (internal quotations and citation omitted);24\n\n\n       24\n           In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this\nCourt adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior\nto the close of business on September 30, 1981.\n\n                                              31\n\faccord Bigge v. Albertsons, Inc., 894 F.2d 1497, 1502-03 (11th Cir. 1990); Harris v.\n\nBirmingham Bd. of Educ., 712 F.2d 1377, 1381 (11th Cir. 1983); Lincoln v. Bd. of\n\nRegents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 697 F.2d 928, 938-39 (11th Cir. 1983); see also Solomon\n\nv. Liberty County Comm’rs, 221 F.3d 1218, 1227 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (stating\n\n“Rule 52(a) does not inhibit an appellate court’s power to correct errors of law”).\n\nB. Analysis\n\n      1. General Principles\n\n      Before analyzing the case before us, it is important to recall some general\n\nprinciples. In Brown I, the Supreme Court held that de jure racial segregation\n\npracticed by school districts violates the Fourteenth Amendment. See Lockett II, 111\n\nF.3d at 842 (citing Brown I, 347 U.S. at 495, 74 S. Ct. at 692). To remedy the illegal\n\nconduct, the Supreme Court ordered federal district courts to supervise local officials\n\nin desegregating school systems. See id. (citing Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 349 U.S. 294,\n\n301, 75 S. Ct. 753, 757 (1955) (Brown II)). Federal judicial supervision of local\n\nofficials, however, was intended to be a temporary measure. See id. (citing Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 247, 111 S. Ct. 630, 637 (1991)).\n\n      A desegregation order is remedial in nature, for it is the means by which victims\n\nof discriminatory conduct are restored to the position they would have occupied in the\n\nabsence of such conduct. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 87, 115 S. Ct. 2038,\n\n\n                                          32\n\f2048 (1995) (citing Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 746-47, 94 S. Ct. 3112, 3128\n\n(1974)). The purpose of federal supervision is not to maintain a desired racial mix at\n\na school. See Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 434-37, 96 S.\n\nCt. 2697, 2704-05 (1976); see also Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494, 112 S. Ct.\n\n1430, 1447 (1992) (noting that “[r]acial balance is not to be achieved for its own\n\nsake”). Rather, a federal court may insist upon a racially balanced school only in\n\nthose situations where a constitutional violation has caused the school to become\n\nracially imbalanced. See id. at 494, 112 S. Ct. at 1447. As the Supreme Court\n\ninstructed 30 years ago, “[I]n the absence of a showing that either the school\n\nauthorities or some other agency of the State has deliberately attempted to fix or alter\n\ndemographic patterns to affect the racial composition of the schools, further\n\nintervention by a district court should not be necessary.” Swann, 402 U.S. at 31-32,\n\n91 S. Ct. at 1283-83. Put simply, a school board has no obligation to remedy racial\n\nimbalances caused by external factors, such as demographic shifts, which are not the\n\nresult of segregation and are beyond the board’s control. See Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 102,\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2055-56 (citing Spangler, 427 U.S. at 434, 96 S. Ct. at 2703-04; Swann,\n\n402 U.S. at 22, 91 S. Ct. at 1279).\n\n      The ultimate objective of any desegregation order is the “restoration of state and\n\nlocal authorities to the control of a school system that is operating in compliance with\n\n\n                                          33\n\fthe Constitution.”25 Id. at 89, 115 S. Ct. at 2049 (internal quotations and citation\n\nomitted). To guide district courts in assessing when it is appropriate to restore local\n\ncontrol, the concept of a “unitary” school system has evolved in federal jurisprudence.\n\nSee generally Freeman, 503 U.S. at 485-92, 112 S. Ct. at 1443-46 (1992). In\n\nevaluating whether a school system is “unitary,” a district court must carefully assess\n\nthe facts and utilize its sound discretion to determine (1) whether local authorities\n\nhave eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable, and (2)\n\nwhether local authorities have in good faith fully and satisfactorily complied with, and\n\nshown a commitment to, the desegregation plan. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 842\n\n(quoting Lee v. Etowah County Bd. of Educ., 963 F.2d 1416, 1425 (11th Cir. 1992)\n\n(citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50, 111 S. Ct. at 638)). For a district court to\n\ndetermine whether the vestiges of discrimination have been eliminated to the extent\n\n\n\n       25\n          Local control is complementary, not contradictory, to the goal of eradicating illegal\ndiscrimination from our nation’s schools. The Supreme Court has spoken to this principle:\n       Returning schools to the control of local authorities at the earliest practicable date\n       is essential to restore their true accountability in our governmental system. When\n       the school district and all state entities participating with it in operating the\n       schools make decisions in the absence of judicial supervision, they can be held\n       accountable to the citizenry, to the political process, and to the courts in the\n       ordinary course. . . . [I]t must be acknowledged that the potential for\n       discrimination and racial hostility is still present in our country, and its\n       manifestations may emerge in new and subtle forms after the effects of de jure\n       segregation have been eliminated. It is the duty of the State and its subdivisions\n       to ensure that such forces do not shape or control the policies of its school\n       systems. Where control lies, so too does responsibility.\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 490, 112 S. Ct. at 1445.\n\n                                                34\n\fpracticable, it must examine the six facets of school operation, the so-called Green\n\nfactors: student assignments, faculty assignments, staff assignments, transportation,\n\nextra-curricular activities, and facilities. See id. (citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 245, 111\n\nS. Ct. at 636 (quoting Green, 391 U.S. at 435, 88 S. Ct. at 1693)). Using its\n\ndiscretion, a court may also consider other facets. See id. (citing Freeman, 503 U.S.\n\nat 492, 112 S. Ct. at 1446).\n\n        It is not uncommon for plaintiffs in school desegregation cases to allege, as\n\nAppellees did here, that racial imbalances in student assignments, are a “vestige of\n\ndiscrimination.” Until unitary status is attained, the defendant school board has the\n\nburden of showing that any racial imbalance in the school system is not traceable, in\n\na proximate way, to the prior de jure segregation. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494, 112\n\nS. Ct. at 1447. Stated differently, once a plaintiff shows de jure segregation (as\n\nAppellees did here in 1962, see supra Part I.A), a presumption arises that all racial\n\nimbalances in a school district are the result of the de jure segregation. See Keyes v.\n\nSch. Dist. No. 1, Denver, Colo., 413 U.S. 189, 208, 93 S. Ct. 2688, 2697 (1973). To\n\nrebut this presumption, “a school board must prove that the imbalances are not the\n\nresult of present or past discrimination on its part.” Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843 (citing\n\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 25, 91 S. Ct. at 1281); accord Keyes, 413 U.S. at 211; 93 S. Ct. at\n\n2699.\n\n\n                                           35\n\f       2. District Court’s Reliance on Lockett I\n\n               a. Wrong Legal Standard\n\n       With the foregoing principles and standards in mind, we turn to the case before\n\nus. Appellants argue, inter alia,26 that the district court committed reversible error by\n\nrelying upon our opinion in Lockett v. Board of Education of Muscogee County, 92\n\nF.3d 1092 (11th Cir. 1996) (Lockett I).27 In Lockett I, a panel of this Court reversed\n\na district court’s finding of unitary status and ordered the district court to “retain\n\njurisdiction . . . to monitor the progress of the school district’s desegregation efforts”\n\nuntil the school district could show that it “ha[d] desegregated its schools to the\n\nmaximum extent practicable.”             Id. at 1101 (emphasis added).              Lockett I was\n\nsubsequently vacated by the same panel. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 840-45.\n\n       26\n          We need not address every argument advanced by Appellants with which we agree.\nWe pause, however, to highlight Appellants’ contention that the district court must provide them\nwith a “precise statement” of their obligations under a consent decree. See, e.g., Jenkins, 515\nU.S. at 101, 115 S. Ct. at 2055. The district judge avoided this requirement and held that she\nwould not “tell [Appellants] which specific means to employ” for achieving unitary status.\nManning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1360; see also id. at 1355 (refusing to describe “specific action” for\nAppellants to take). Even if we were to hold that Appellants’ school district was not unitary, we\nwould nonetheless remand this case with instructions that the district court provide specific\nguidance on what steps Appellants must take to achieve unitary status. But since we conclude\nthe school district is unitary, see infra Part III, there is no need for the district judge to issue a\nstatement, precise or otherwise, on Appellants’ obligations.\n       27\n           The district judge was aware that Lockett I had been superseded by Lockett II, but she\njustified her reliance on Lockett I upon the belief that “Lockett I reiterated established principles\nof law.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1311. District judges in this circuit, however, are required\nto adhere to the decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court. See Fishman & Tobin, Inc. v.\nTropical Shipping & Constr. Co., ___ F.3d ___, Slip Op. No. 99-4375, at 1299 n.14 (11th Cir.\n2001).\n\n                                                  36\n\f       The district judge, in relying on Lockett I, applied the wrong legal standard.\n\nThe law does not require, as stated in Lockett I, that a school board eliminate the\n\nvestiges of past discrimination “to the maximum extent practicable.” 92 F.3d at 1101\n\n(emphasis added).         Rather, the law merely requires that the vestiges of past\n\ndiscrimination be eliminated “to the extent practicable.” Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 842\n\n(emphasis added); accord Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 90, 115 S. Ct. at 2050;28 Freeman, 503\n\nU.S. at 492, 112 S. Ct. at 1446; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250, 111 S. Ct. at 638; United\n\nStates v. Georgia, 171 F.3d 1344, 1347 (11th Cir. 1999); Lee, 963 F.2d at 1425. The\n\ndistrict judge incorrectly referred to the “maximum extent practicable (or possible)”\n\nstandard at least 12 times in her opinion of October 24, 1998, and four times in her\n\norder of December 4, 1998. See Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1287, 1289, 1290, 1292,\n\n1293, 1301, 1312, 1326, 1334, 1335; Manning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1356, 1359, 1360.\n\n       Accordingly, the critical issue is whether the district judge’s repeated use of the\n\nwrong legal standard sufficiently tainted or infected the findings of fact so as to strip\n\nthose findings of the insulation normally accorded under Rule 52(a). See supra Part\n\nII.A; Corley, 566 F.2d at 1001. We would not permit an inadvertent use of language\n\n\n       28\n           The district court in Jenkins stated that its goal was to integrate the school district to\nthe “maximum extent practicable” and to the “maximum potential.” 515 U.S. at 81, 101, 115\nS. Ct. at 2045, 2055. The Supreme Court expressly rejected this test and held that the proper test\nwas whether the deficiencies “attributable to prior de jure segregation had been remedied to the\nextent practicable.” Id. at 101, 115 S. Ct. at 2055.\n\n                                                 37\n\fby a district court to constitute reversible error. Here, however, we are persuaded that\n\nthe district judge’s mistake is more than mere inadvertence.29 As we discuss\n\nimmediately below, the district judge’s findings on student assignments and good faith\n\nwere tainted (and thus stripped of Rule 52(a) protection) because the district judge\n\nheld Appellants to a higher standard than the law requires.\n\n               b.     Application of Wrong Legal Standard to Finding on Student\n                      Assignments\n\n       In Lockett, the critical issue was, as it is here, whether the racial imbalances in\n\nstudent assignments precluded a finding of unitary status. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at\n\n842, 843. Lockett II held that, for a school board to rebut the presumption of de jure\n\nsegregation, the school board had to prove “the [racial] imbalances [were] not the\n\nresult of present or past discrimination on its part.” Id. at 843; see also supra Part\n\nII.B.1.     The district court in Lockett II found the school board rebutted the\n\npresumption by presenting expert demographic evidence showing the imbalances to\n\nbe the result of voluntary housing patterns and demographic change. See id. The\n\nschool board’s demographic evidence was not contradicted by plaintiffs’ experts. See\n\n\n\n\n       29\n           The phrase “to the extent practicable” is not meaningless surplusage. As the Third\nCircuit has noted, “[T]he phrase ‘to the extent practicable’ implies a reasonable limit on the\nduration of [the] federal supervision” because “extend[ing] federal court supervision indefinitely\nis neither practicable, desirable, nor proper.” Coalition to Save our Children v. State Bd. of\nEduc. of Del., 90 F.3d 752, 760 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n                                               38\n\fid. The Lockett II majority affirmed the district court’s finding as not being clearly\n\nerroneous. See id. at 844.\n\n       By contrast, Lockett I staked out a position on the law under which school\n\nboards would have been held to a higher standard. Instead of affirming, the Lockett I\n\npanel would have remanded, so the district court could have continued supervising the\n\nschool board “until such time as a reliable body of data exist[ed] to assure . . . that the\n\nschool district ha[d] desegregated its schools to the maximum extent practicable.”\n\nLockett I, 92 F.3d at 1101 (emphasis added); accord Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 844\n\n(Barkett, J. dissenting). Under Lockett I, a school board would have been required to\n\nremedy racial imbalances even when “the imbalances [were] caused by circumstances\n\nover which the school district has no control.” Lockett I, 92 F.2d at 1099 (quoted in\n\nManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1310). Moreover, according to Lockett I, to be declared\n\nunitary, it is not enough for a school board to show demographic shifts as the cause\n\nof the racial imbalances, as “demographic shifts are not necessarily independent of\n\nprior unconstitutional practices.”30 Id. at 1099 (cited in Manning, 28 F.Supp.2d at\n\n1359).\n\n\n       30\n           Judge Barkett, the author of Lockett I, further elaborated on this view in her Lockett II\ndissent. In particular, Judge Barkett wrote that it was erroneous to “assume[] that as long as a\nschool district can point to some force not directly related to a school district’s overt actions\nwhich is causing or exacerbating racial imbalances, then the resulting imbalance is not traceable\nto past practices.” Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 845 (Barkett, J. dissenting).\n\n                                                 39\n\f      Lockett I, however, is not the law of this circuit. Rather, the law of the circuit\n\nmust be distilled from Lockett II. We reiterate that, to overcome the presumption that\n\nracial imbalances are constitutionally violative, “a school board must prove that the\n\nimbalances are not the result of present or past discrimination on its part.” Lockett II,\n\n111 F.3d at 843. Lockett II stands for the proposition that a school board overcomes\n\nthis presumption when it shows that some external force, which is not the result of\n\nsegregation and is beyond the school board’s control, substantially caused the racial\n\nimbalances. See id. (upholding declaration of unitary status when district court found\n\ndemographic shifts caused racial imbalances); see also Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 102, 115\n\nS. Ct. at 2055-56; contra Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 845 (Barkett, J. dissenting)\n\n(advocating contrary proposition). Where a defendant school board shows that\n\ndemographic shifts are a substantial cause of the racial imbalances, the defendant has\n\novercome the presumption of de jure segregation. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843.\n\nCourts shall not assume that demographic shifts are a result of the past de jure\n\nsegregation. Contra Lockett I, 92 F.3d at 1099 (advocating contrary proposition);\n\nLockett II, 111 F.3d at 845 (Barkett, J. dissenting) (same). Such an assumption is\n\nimproper because “[i]t is simply not always the case that demographic forces causing\n\npopulation change bear any real and substantial relation to a de jure violation, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\flaw need not proceed on that premise.”31 Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843 (internal\n\nalterations omitted) (quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 496, 112 S. Ct. at 1448). Lastly,\n\na plaintiff does not undermine the strength of a defendant’s demographic evidence by\n\nmerely asserting that demographics alone do not explain the racial imbalances.32\n\nRather, for a plaintiff to preserve the presumption of de jure segregation, the plaintiff\n\nmust show that the demographic shifts are the result of the prior de jure segregation\n\nor some other discriminatory conduct.\n\n       If the district judge had applied Lockett II, rather than Lockett I, her findings of\n\nfact would have led her to the same conclusion as the magistrate judge with respect\n\nto student assignments. The district judge, like the magistrate judge, found that\n\ndemographic shifts were a “substantial” or “significant” reason for the racial\n\nimbalances and that the racial imbalances were inevitable, irrespective of Appellants’\n\nefforts. See supra Part I.B.3.a; Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1303, 1311; Manning, 28\n\nF.Supp.2d at 1356. With this finding of fact, Appellants overcame the presumption\n\nthat the racial imbalances in student assignments were the result of de jure\n\n\n\n       31\n            In addition, “[a]s the de jure violation becomes more remote in time and . . .\ndemographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely that a current racial imbalance in a school\ndistrict is a vestige of the prior de jure system.” Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843 (quoting Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 496, 112 S. Ct. at 1448) (internal alterations included).\n       32\n            It is elementary that one may not rebut extensive evidence with a scintilla of evidence.\nSee, e.g., 2 McCormick on Evidence § 338, at 416 (John W. Strong et al. eds., 5th ed. 1999).\n\n                                                 41\n\fsegregation. To preserve the presumption, Appellees were required to show that the\n\ndemographic shifts were the result of the past segregative practices or some other\n\ndiscriminatory conduct. Appellees made no such showing. The district judge never\n\nfound that the racial imbalances at the 17 challenged schools were caused by the past\n\nde jure segregation or other discriminatory acts. In fact, the district judge found the\n\nexact opposite. That is, the district judge found that Appellants did not deliberately\n\ncause the racial imbalances through segregative policies or practices. See supra Part\n\nI.B.3.a; Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1310. Appellees merely persuaded the district\n\njudge that demographics alone did not account for the racial imbalances. See id. at\n\n1302 (refusing to find that a “shift in demography [was] the sole cause [of] the [racial]\n\nimbalance[s]” in the school system). Such a finding is insufficient to deny Appellants\n\na declaration of unitary status.\n\n      Accordingly, by applying the correct legal standard from Lockett II to the\n\ndistrict judge’s findings of fact, we reach the same conclusion as the magistrate judge:\n\nAppellants have achieved unitary status with respect to student assignments.\n\n             c. Application of Wrong Legal Standard to Finding on Good Faith\n\n      As discussed previously, the district judge had two interrelated areas of concern\n\nwhich precluded, in her view, a finding of good faith: Appellants’ apathy and the lack\n\nof an effective MTM program. See supra Part I.B.3.b. The district judge’s reliance\n\n\n                                           42\n\fon Lockett I undoubtedly infected her finding with regard to Appellants’ alleged\n\napathy. The district judge, as noted above, expected Appellants to “desegregate the\n\npublic schools in Hillsborough County to the maximum extent practicable.” E.g.,\n\nManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1287; supra Part I.B.3.b. Such an expectation was\n\nerroneous, for the law does not require a defendant school board to take every\n\nconceivable step in attempting to desegregate. See, e.g., Freeman, 503 U.S. at 493,\n\n112 S. Ct. at 1447 (expressly rejecting premise that “heroic measures must be taken\n\nto ensure racial balance”). Thus, the district judge’s concern about Appellants’\n\nalleged “apathy” was an error of law directly traceable to her reliance upon Lockett\n\nI.\n\n      Further, Appellants’ lack of an effective MTM program does not necessarily\n\namount to a finding of bad faith. For instance, in Lockett, the school board did not\n\nimplement its MTM program until years after the desegregation decree was entered\n\nand ignored other requirements of the desegregation decree. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d\n\nat 844; Lockett I, 92 F.3d at 1100, 1101. Nonetheless, we affirmed a finding of good\n\nfaith based in part on the district court’s finding that the school board had never\n\nviolated a court order, had never been enjoined or sanctioned, and had consulted with\n\nAfrican-American members of community before modifying the student assignment\n\nplan. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843-44; contra Lockett I, 92 F.3d at 1100, 1101.\n\n\n                                         43\n\fLikewise, in the case sub judice, Appellants never violated a court order, never were\n\nsanctioned, In and consulted extensively with the African-American community,\n\nincluding Appellees, prior to implementing new student assignments under the 1991\n\nTask Force Report. See supra Parts I.B.2 & I.B.3.b. Therefore, based on Lockett II,\n\nthe district judge clearly could have found the Appellants acted in good faith,\n\nnotwithstanding the lack of a viable MTM program.\n\n       Additionally, we are persuaded that, if the district judge had followed the law\n\nas set forth in Lockett II, she would have concluded that Appellants have acted in good\n\nfaith. As we explained in Lockett II, in determining whether a school board has acted\n\nin good faith, a court should not dwell on isolated discrepancies, but rather should\n\n“consider whether the school board’s policies form a consistent pattern of lawful\n\nconduct directed to eliminating earlier violations.”33 Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843\n\n(internal quotations omitted); see also Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491, 112 S. Ct. at 1446\n\n(holding that “a court should give particular attention to the school system’s record\n\nof compliance”). Repeatedly in the October 26, 1998, opinion, the district judge\n\ncommended Appellants for their desegregation efforts. See, e.g., Manning, 24\n\n\n       33\n           The focus is on the school board’s pattern of conduct, and not isolated events, because\nthe purpose of the good-faith finding is to ensure that a school board has accepted racial equality\nand will abstain from intentional discrimination in the future. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843\n(citing Freeman, 503 U.S. at 498, 112 S. Ct. at 1449). Focusing on isolated aberrations blurs a\ncourt’s long-term vision.\n\n                                                44\n\fF.Supp.2d at 1287, 1311, 1312, 1325; supra Part I.B.3.b. At the end of the opinion,\n\nthe district judge further commented:\n\n       After evaluating the voluminous record in this case, the Court is\n       convinced that [Appellants] have a short road to travel [to attain unitary\n       status]. Essentially, Defendants need to demonstrate that they are willing\n       to aggressively desegregate the school district to the maximum extent\n       practicable.34\n\nManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1335. Based on the foregoing statement, we are convinced\n\nthat, if the district judge had applied the correct standard, she would have found (as\n\nthe magistrate judge did) that Appellants acted in good faith, notwithstanding the\n\nabsence of an effective MTM program and other possible discrepancies.\n\n       Our conclusion is buttressed by two other points. First, the MTM program, as\n\nconceded by Appellees’ expert, would have been ineffective in desegregating the 17\n\nchallenged schools.35 As such, the MTM program should have had only marginal\n\nrelevance in analyzing whether Appellants’ “policies form[ed] a consistent pattern of\n\nlawful conduct directed to eliminating earlier violations.” Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843\n\n(emphasis added) (internal quotations and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n       34\n           In contrast to the district judge, the magistrate judge recognized that “[a] school\nboard’s affirmative duty to desegregate does not require adoption of the most desegregative\nalternative available.”\n       35\n          We are by no means suggesting that a desegregation plan cannot, or should not,\ninclude an MTM program. The Supreme Court has spoken favorably of MTM programs. See\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 26-27, 91 S. Ct. at 1281.\n\n                                                45\n\f       Second, discerning a school board’s good faith is in some respects a subjective\n\nfinding. Thus, such a finding depends in part on the judge’s personal observation of\n\nthe witnesses. The magistrate judge, not the district judge, observed all of the\n\nwitnesses at the evidentiary hearing. Granted, the district judge was free under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 636 to make a de novo determination of the magistrate judge’s findings. In\n\nother contexts, however, we have cautioned district judges from overruling a\n\nmagistrate judge’s finding where credibility determinations are dispositive. See, e.g.,\n\nProffitt v. Wainwright, 685 F.2d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir. 1982) (noting that, in criminal\n\nor habeas corpus cases, a district judge’s reasons for rejecting a report and\n\nrecommendation must be consistent with the credibility choices made by a\n\nmagistrate). In addition, the rationale for deferring to a district court’s finding of fact\n\nis that a trial judge is aware of the variations in demeanor which bear so heavily in\n\nmaking a subjective determination. See Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575, 105 S. Ct. at 1512.\n\nWhere, as here, a district judge does not personally observe the witnesses in making\n\na subjective finding of fact, we view such a finding with skepticism, especially where,\n\nas here, the finding is contrary to the one recommended by the judicial official who\n\nobserved the witnesses.\n\n\n\n\n                                            46\n\f                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n      The district judge’s finding that Appellants have not achieved unitary status was\n\ntainted and infected by reliance on an incorrect legal standard. As such, we reverse\n\nthe district judge’s orders of October 26, 1998, and December 4, 1998. Upon remand,\n\nthe district court shall enter judgment declaring the Hillsborough County school\n\nsystem unitary. Therefore, federal judicial supervision of the Hillsborough County\n\nschool system shall cease.\n\n      REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         47\n\f",

The primary reason for the 1991 Consent Order was to enable Appellants to\n\nreorganize the school district, so as to eliminate single grade centers and to create\n\nmiddle schools. The 1991 Consent Order, which was to be implemented over a 7-year\n\nperiod, did not annul the July 1971 Order, but merely modified it.\n\n      Appellee moved in 1994 to enforce the 1991 Consent Order. The matter was\n\nreferred to the magistrate judge who recommended denying the motion. The district\n\njudge, however, deferred ruling on the motion and sua sponte recommitted the matter\n\nto the magistrate judge to consider whether the school district had become unitary,\n\nthereby removing the need for federal judicial oversight.\n\n      In October 1996, the magistrate judge conducted a 7-day hearing, at which both\n\nsides presented considerable evidence. In August 1997, the magistrate judge issued\n\na detailed report and recommendation wherein she recommended the district court\n\nfind that Appellants had achieved unitary status and thus should be released from\n\nfederal judicial supervision. Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district judge\n\nin a 110-page order dated October 26, 1998, rejected in part and adopted in part the\n\n\n      3\n          For a summary of the minor modifications, see infra note 6.\n\n                                                5\n\fmagistrate judge’s report and recommendation. See Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1277-\n\n1335. The district judge concluded that Appellants had not attained unitary status and\n\ntherefore federal judicial supervision was still warranted.4 See Manning, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Within ten days of the order dated October 26, 1998, Appellants filed a\n\nmotion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). The district\n\ncourt, in a 13-page order, denied the motion on December 4, 1998. See Manning, 28\n\nF.Supp.2d at 1361. Within 30 days, Appellants filed a notice of appeal as to the\n\ndistrict judge’s orders of October 26, 1998, and December 4, 1998.\n\nB. Facts\n\n       To analyze this case that has endured for over 40 years, we first summarize the\n\ncontents of the July 1971 Order and the 1991 Consent Order, which, with minor\n\nmodifications, have served as the guideposts for Appellants’ journey toward a unitary\n\nschool district. Then, we set forth the district court’s most recent factual findings with\n\nrespect to Appellants’ unitary status.\n\n       1. July 1971 Order\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          Before the district court, Appellees also argued that, even if the school district were\nunitary, this status would not constitute a “changed circumstance” warranting a modification or\nvacation of the 1991 Consent Order. See Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1287-88 (citing Rufo v.\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992)). The district court rejected\nAppellees’ argument. See id. at 1288. Since Appellees do not contest this ruling on appeal, we\ndo not address it.\n\n                                                6\n\f      As previously discussed, the district court ordered Appellants in May of 1971\n\nto submit a comprehensive desegregation plan. The district court stated that the\n\n“primary objective” of the plan should be the abolition of segregation. In particular,\n\nthe district court sought to eliminate, at every school, racial balances where black\n\nstudents comprised more than 50% of the student population. The district court\n\nfurther stated that the “most acceptable and desirable” result would be a white/black\n\nratio of 86%/14% in senior high schools, 80%/20% in junior high schools, and\n\n79%/21% in elementary schools.\n\n       The July 1971 Order, which ratified Appellants’ proposed desegregation plan,\n\ndealt primarily with student assignments in grades one through twelve.                        For\n\nelementary schools, the plan clustered each predominately black school with two to\n\nfive predominantly white schools. The white schools would be used for grades one\n\nthrough five and would be integrated with black children from “satellite zones”5 who\n\nhad previously attended the black school in the cluster. The black school in each\n\ncluster would be used as a sixth-grade center and would be integrated with white\n\nchildren who had previously attended the white schools in the cluster.\n\n      For junior high schools, each black school would be clustered with one to three\n\nwhite schools. The black schools would be used for seventh grade, and the white\n\n\n      5\n          A satellite zone is an area not contiguous with the main attendance zone for the school.\n\n                                                7\n\fschools would be used for eighth and ninth grades. Again, the schools would be\n\nintegrated with students from satellite zones. For senior high schools, the two black\n\nschools would be closed, but their facilities would be used for junior high schools.\n\nThrough a series of re-zoning and satellite busing measures, the white high schools\n\nwould be integrated.\n\n       With regard to faculty and staff, the district court had previously entered an\n\norder on August 25, 1970. In the July 1971 Order, the court found that no additional\n\nmeasures were necessary, and it directed Appellants to continue to abide by the\n\nAugust 25, 1970, order. With respect to transportation, facilities, and extracurricular\n\nactivities, the July 1971 Order directed Appellants to comply with all previous orders.\n\nThe order also mandated that all operations relating to these areas should be conducted\n\nin a non-discriminatory manner and should be regularly re-examined by Appellants.\n\n       The July 1971 Order also remarked on four other topics: (1) majority to\n\nminority transfers, (2) other transfer rules, (3) the bi-racial committee, and\n\n(4) approval of site locations. Specifically, the district court stated, “Each of these has\n\nbeen required by previous orders of this Court. Some of them may not be required if\n\n[Appellants’] plan is effectuated and accomplished.” Nevertheless, the district court\n\nstated that it was “retaining jurisdiction and [would] require the continuation of all of\n\nthese procedures to be available and used as necessary.”\n\n\n                                            8\n\f      Attached to the July 1971 Order were two exhibits which explained the bi-racial\n\ncommittee, majority-to-minority transfers, and other transfer rules. The bi-racial\n\ncommittee was to serve as an advisory body on a number of issues and was to consist\n\nof ten members, with Appellants and Appellees each selecting five members. In some\n\ninstances, the committee was to receive reports about students transferring from their\n\nassigned schools. In other instances, Appellants were barred from approving student\n\ntransfers before considering a recommendation from the committee.\n\n      Concerning majority-to-minority transfers, the attached exhibits stated the\n\nfollowing:\n\n      Majority to minority transfer – Any student shall be permitted to transfer\n      from a school in which his race is in the majority in order to attend the\n      closest school to his residence in which his race is in the minority.\n      ....\n      The transfer forms shall be available at each public school in\n      Hillsborough County and the County School offices.\n      ....\n      The transferee is to be given priority for space and thus the transfer is not\n      to be dependent on space being available.\n\n      Transportation will be provided by the School Board in service or in\n      kind to the school to which the transfer is made if that school is more\n      than two miles from the home.\n\n      In conclusion, the July 1971 Order stated that Appellants’ desegregation plan\n\n“fully complie[d] with the [district] [c]ourt’s order of May 11, 1971,\" and that it\n\nwould “result in the establishment of a unitary school system in Hillsborough County,\n\n\n                                           9\n\fFlorida.” The July 1971 Order noted, however, that Appellants had a “continuing\n\nresponsibility” to ensure the plan would be effectuated. Moreover, each year\n\nfollowing the implementation of the July 1971 Order, Appellants filed two reports per\n\nyear with the district court and provided copies to Appellees. Lastly, the July 1971\n\nOrder retained jurisdiction in the district court for “such further action as may be\n\nnecessary and required.”\n\n       2. 1991 Consent Order\n\n       Between 1971 and 1991, the modifications to the July 1971 Order were minor.6\n\nBy 1991, however, Appellants had determined, based upon a comprehensive study,\n\nthat the school district would benefit if middle schools (grades 6-8) were established.\n\nTo accomplish this, the July 1971 Order had to be modified, because that order had\n\nrelied extensively on single-grade centers (grades 6 and 7) to desegregate the school\n\ndistrict. Thus, Appellants entered into negotiations with Appellees, and the product\n\nof those negotiations was the 1991 Consent Order.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          The modifications included, inter alia: changes in transfer rules for children of school\nemployees; approval of a new high school site; changes in academic transfer rules; the closure of\ncertain schools; and the creation of magnet schools. Perhaps, the most significant modification\ndealt with Lee Elementary School, which by 1974 had a black population in excess of 50%. To\ncorrect this imbalance, Appellants, pursuant to the district court’s order, converted Lee to a\nsixth-grade center and transferred the former Lee students (first through fifth graders) to seven\nother elementary schools.\n\n                                               10\n\f       The centerpiece of the 1991 Consent Order was the Middle School Task Force\n\nReport 3 of July 1991 (hereinafter “Task Force Report”), which the district court\n\nincorporated into the consent order.7 The Task Force Report was presented to the\n\nschool board by a 12-person committee. This committee included Mr. Henry Carley,\n\nPresident of the Tampa Branch of the NAACP. In addition, a legal committee,\n\nconsisting of, inter alia, Mr. Al Davis of the NAACP, reviewed the Task Force\n\nReport, and Appellees’ own desegregation expert, Dr. Leonard Stevens, was involved\n\nin shaping the Task Force Report. Furthermore, the Task Force Report included two\n\nseparate position statements prepared by various African-American community\n\ngroups (Howard W. Blake Alumni Group, Coalition of African American\n\nOrganizations, Greater Tampa Urban League, Inc., and Beta Sigma Zeta Chapter of\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority). In sum, as the 1991 Consent Order explained, the Task Force\n\nReport was the result of “extensive discussions” between Appellants and Appellees,\n\nand the discussions were designed to “to ensure . . . that plans for the implementation\n\nof the [Task Force Report] were formulated in a manner that addressed the interests\n\nand concerns of [Appellees].”\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        The parties and the district court use interchangeably the terms “Task Force Report”\nand “Middle School Plan.” For the sake of simplicity, we use solely the term Task Force Report.\n\n                                              11\n\f      The Task Force Report proposed substantial changes to the structure of the\n\nschool system. Under the July 1971 Order, the school system generally had consisted\n\nof five tiers: elementary schools (grades K-5), sixth-grade centers, seventh-grade\n\ncenters, junior high schools (grades 8-9), and high schools (grades 10-12). In contrast,\n\nthe Task Force Report called for a three-tier school system: elementary schools\n\n(grades K-5); middle schools (grades 6-8); and high schools (grades 9-12). This new\n\nstructure would be achieved through a so-called “cluster model,” under which 17\n\nclusters would be formed. For each cluster, the high school would serve as the “basic\n\nunit” and its students would be drawn from “feeder” middle and elementary schools.\n\nThe Task Force Report estimated that it would take five to seven years to implement\n\nthe cluster model.\n\n      The cluster model proposed by Task Force Report was undoubtedly the most\n\nsubstantial change to the structure of the school system since the July 1971 Order.\n\nThe objective of July 1971 Order had been to desegregate the school system. By\n\ncontrast, one of the primary objectives of the Task Force Report was “to maintain a\n\ndesegregated school system.” (emphasis added). In an apparent attempt to meet this\n\nobjective, the 1991 Consent Order directed Appellants “to minimize (to the extent\n\npracticable) the number of schools which deviate from the system-wide student\n\nenrollment [race] ratios.”     Moreover, the 1991 Consent Order assumed that\n\n\n                                          12\n\fintervening demographic changes might necessitate future modifications in student\n\nassignments in order to maintain a desegregated school district.8\n\n       To further the goal of maintaining desired race ratios, the Task Force Report\n\nattempted to project the race ratios at each school after the cluster plan’s\n\nimplementation. In summary, the Task Force Report predicted:\n\n       The number of schools reflecting a ten or higher percent race ratio\n       variance [from the recommended ratio of 20/80%] will increase from 36\n       to 46. The plan also increases the number of schools from 56 to 72 that\n       will have an almost perfectly balanced race ratio with a student variance\n       of five percent or less from the recommended ratio of 20/80% ratio.\n\nAppendix 1 of the Task Force Report provided more detail as to the projected racial\n\nbalance at each school. Fourteen schools were projected to have a 40% or greater\n\nblack population,9 and an additional four schools were projected to have a 39% black\n\npopulation.10 These projections, as part of the Task Force Report, were incorporated\n\ninto the 1991 Consent Order — a consent decree to which Appellees were parties.\n\n\n\n       8\n           This assumption was wrong as a matter of law. External factors which are not the\nresult of segregation and are beyond a school board’s control should not be part of the remedial\ncalculus when shaping a federal desegregation decree.

For example, the report\n\nimplemented magnet programs,11 which were designed in part “to reduce minority\n\nisolation” and “to promote desegregation in schools.”12 The report also suggested a\n\nmulti-cultural curriculum for students in all grades and instructional sessions to enable\n\nstaff to deal with diverse populations.\n\n       One omission in the Task Force Report, however, is particularly noteworthy in\n\nlight of subsequent events: majority-to-minority transfers. Although they had been\n\ndiscussed briefly in the July 1971 Order, majority-to-minority transfers were not\n\nmentioned once in the 37-page Task Force Report, nor in the 8 attached appendices,\n\nnor in the 1991 Consent Order. Dr. Stevens — Appellees’ desegregation expert who\n\nhelped shape the Task Force Report — admitted at the 1996 evidentiary hearing that\n\nmajority-to-minority transfers would have been insignificant in alleviating the racial\n\nimbalances in the school district.\n\n       3. Factual Findings\n\n\n\n\n       11\n         The magnet programs were intended to supplement a traditional curriculum with a\nfocus on special “themes”, such as computers and technology or visual and performing arts.\n       12\n          In addition, the “racial composition targets for magnet school populations [was] not\n[to] exceed 40% black.”\n\n                                               14\n\f       The magistrate judge, in her 1997 report and recommendation, structured her\n\nfactual findings around the six Green factors,13 plus a seventh factor, quality of\n\neducation, which has been used by some courts to evaluate a school district’s unitary\n\nstatus.

Based on all of these findings, the magistrate\n\njudge recommended the school district be declared unitary in all respects and that\n\nfederal judicial supervision of the school district be terminated.\n\n       The district judge found that the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation\n\nwas “comprehensive” and “agree[d] with a majority of the [m]agistrate [j]udge’s\n\nanalysis.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1287. For six of the seven factors (faculty, staff,\n\ntransportation, extracurricular activities, facilities and resource allocation, and quality\n\nof education), the district judge adopted most, if not all, of the magistrate judge’s\n\nfindings.14 See id. at 1316-34. In their brief to this Court, Appellees do not contest\n\n\n       13\n           Those six factors are student assignments, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular\nactivities, and facilities and resource allocation. See Green, 391 U.S. at 435, 88 S. Ct. at 1693.\n       14\n           Regarding these six factors, the district judge’s order is less than clear. After a\nthorough review, however, we are convinced that the district judge overruled most, and possibly\nall, of Appellees’ objections to the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation. The\n\n                                                 15\n\fthe findings related to these six factors, and thus further elaboration is unnecessary\n\nexcept to emphasize that the findings support a declaration of unitary status.\n\n       With regard to the remaining Green factor (student assignments), the district\n\njudge expressed some disagreement with the magistrate judge. The district judge also\n\ndiffered with the magistrate judge’s finding on Appellants’ good-faith compliance.\n\nAs we discuss in Part II, the district judge used an incorrect legal standard. As a\n\nresult, the district judge’s legal conclusion, though based mostly upon the magistrate\n\njudge’s factual findings, was erroneous. To help illuminate our discussion in Part II,\n\nwe narrate below the magistrate judge’s factual findings related to student assignments\n\nand Appellants’ good faith, and we highlight, when necessary, particular findings\n\nadopted by the district judge. We also note those few areas where the district judge\n\nrejected the factual findings of the magistrate judge.\n\n               a. Student Assignments\n\n       As of the 1995-96 school year, the Hillsborough County school district\n\nconsisted of approximately 120,000 students, 108 elementary schools, 27 junior high\n\nschools, and 15 senior high schools. Relying on a standard proposed by Appellees’\n\nand Appellants’ experts, the magistrate judge designated any school with a\n\n\n\n\nobjections sustained by the district judge, if any, are inconsequential to our ultimate holding in\nthis case.\n\n                                                 16\n\fblack/white ratio varying plus or minus 20 points from a 20/80 ratio as being “racially\n\nidentifiable” or “racially imbalanced.”15 It was undisputed that, by the 1971-72 school\n\nyear, all schools were desegregated. Furthermore, the evidence showed that, at the\n\ntime of the 1996 evidentiary hearing, approximately 90% of the schools were not\n\nracially identifiable. Appellees, however, identified 17 schools as racially identifiable\n\n\n\n\n       15\n          Since the parties agree on what constitutes a racially identifiable school, we shall\naccept their definition for purposes of this case and this case only. We pass no judgment on the\ncorrectness of this definition.\n\n                                               17\n\fand made these schools the focus of the 1996 evidentiary hearing.16 Ironically, of\n\nthese 17 schools, 9 were among the 14 schools that the Task Force Report projected\n\n\n         16\n           Both the district judge and the magistrate judge referred to 16 schools. A review of\nthe Joint Pre-Evidentiary Hearing Statement and the report by Appellees’ expert reveals that\nAppellees challenged the racial identifiability of 17 schools. Both the district judge and the\nmagistrate judge omitted Mort Elementary from their findings. This oversight, however, is of no\nsignificance. The following are the percentages of black students at each of these 17 challenged\nschools during the 1972-73 and 1995-96 school years:\n\n School                                  Percentage of Black       Percentage of Black\n                                         Students, 1972-73         Students, 1995-96\n Robles                                  24%                       91%\n Edison                                  36%                       77%\n Sulphur Springs                         19%                       74%\n Oak Park                                23%                       69%\n Graham                                  35%                       67%\n Foster                                  21%                       61%\n Cleveland                               26%                       58%\n Shaw                                    15%                       57%\n Witter                                  18%                       54%\n Cahoon                                  21%                       53%\n Clair Mel                               18%                       49%\n West Tampa                              14%                       47%\n DeSoto                                  35%                       43%\n Mort                                    N/A                       43%\n Van Buren                               17%                       53%\n Sligh                                   20%                       50%\n Dowdell                                 14%                       48%\n\n\n                                               18\n\fwould have a 40% or greater black population, and two were among the four schools\n\nthat the Task Force Report projected would have a 39% black population.17\n\nImmediately after the July 1971 Order was implemented, all of these schools became\n\nracially balanced.18\n\n       The critical factual question at the evidentiary hearing was whether the racial\n\nimbalances at the 17 schools were caused by Appellants’ past de jure segregation (or\n\nother discriminatory conduct), or whether, instead, the racial imbalances were caused\n\nby nondiscriminatory factors and circumstances. In a joint statement submitted prior\n\nto the evidentiary hearing, Appellants contended that demographic shifts had caused\n\nthe schools to become racially identifiable. In the same joint statement, Appellees did\n\nnot directly rebut Appellants’ contention, but instead argued that “[d]emographic\n\nchange alone does not account for the racial identifiability in the Hillsborough County\n\nschool system.” (emphasis added).\n\n       To resolve their factual dispute, the parties presented considerable evidence to\n\nthe magistrate judge, including, inter alia, reports on attendance boundaries,\n\ndemographic reports, and expert testimony. We need not repeat all this evidence here,\n\nas it is fully set forth in the opinion of the district court. See Manning, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Instead, we compare the findings of the magistrate judge to those of\n\nthe district judge.\n\n       The magistrate judge, in her report and recommendation, recounted the expert\n\ntestimony of Dr. David Armor, one of Appellants’ experts — testimony that the\n\nmagistrate judge personally observed. Dr. Armor explained that he reviewed the\n\nextensive demographic data contained in a report by Dr. W.A.V. Clark, another of\n\nAppellants’ experts. Based on this evidence, Dr. Armor opined on the witness stand\n\nthat “none of the schools that were currently imbalanced . . . were caused by\n\n[Appellants’] action[s,]” but rather such imbalances “were caused by demographics.”\n\nThe magistrate judge also reviewed the testimony of Dr. Fred Shelley, Appellees’\n\ndemographic expert — once again, testimony that the magistrate judge personally\n\nobserved. Dr. Shelley did not conduct his own demographic study, but rather relied\n\non the data supplied by Dr. Clark (Appellants’ expert). Dr. Shelley opined “that it is\n\nperhaps difficult to conclude that [the] increase in racial imbalance is attributable\n\nsolely to the processes of natural demographic change.” In the end, the magistrate\n\njudge agreed with Dr. Armor and found that demographic change is the “most likely\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\fexplanation” for the racial imbalances. The magistrate judge faulted Dr. Shelley for\n\nnot providing an alternative explanation for the racial imbalances.19\n\n       The district judge, though not observing any of the testimony, agreed for the\n\nmost part with the findings of the magistrate judge. In conformity with Dr. Armor’s\n\nopinion (and the magistrate judge’s finding), the district judge found that “[t]here\n\n[was] no indication that the racial identity of the schools in Hillsborough County has\n\nbeen deliberately caused by segregative policies or practices by [Appellants]” and that\n\n“based on the totality of the evidence, a shift in demographics [was] a substantial\n\ncause of the racial identifiability in Hillsborough County’s schools.” Manning, 24\n\nF.Supp.2d at 1303, 1310. The district judge likewise was unable to cite, in either of\n\nher two orders, any independent demographic evidence put forward by Appellees or\n\nan alternative explanation proffered by Dr. Shelley as to the cause of the racial\n\nimbalances.\n\n\n       19\n           In his report, Dr. Shelley did not attempt to link the present racial imbalances with past\nde jure segregation, but rather merely tried to prove that demographics alone did not cause the\nupsurge in racially identifiable schools. At the evidentiary hearing, when asked how his report\ndiffered from Dr. Clark’s report, Dr. Shelley responded:\n        My reaction to the report was that, while I thought the demographic analysis was\n        very good, what I felt was missing in the report was how to reason from the\n        analysis of the demographic change that was undertaken to a conclusion that\n        demographic change was the sole cause of the observed racial imbalance in the\n        public schools in Hillsborough County.\nTr. of Evidentiary Hearing on October 24, 1996, Vol. 4, at 66 (emphasis added). Dr. Shelley\nexpressed doubts that “one can conclude without ambiguity that [the racial] imbalance is caused\nonly by natural demographic changes.” Id. at 66-67 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                 21\n\f      The district judge seemed to have adopted in toto Appellants’ theory of the case\n\n(and the magistrate judge’s finding). As the district judge stated time and time again,\n\na shift in demographics was a substantial or significant cause of the racial imbalances,\n\nand Appellants did not deliberately cause the racial imbalances. See id. at 1293\n\n(stating “that the racial imbalances in the schools [were] not the result of a deliberate\n\nattempt by [Appellants] to affect or alter demographic patterns to affect the racial\n\ncomposition of the schools”); id. at 1311 (finding “the evidence presented by the\n\nparties establishes that a shift in demographics played a significant role in the racial\n\ncompositions of the schools” and that Appellants had “not ‘affirmatively’ exacerbated\n\nracial imbalances”); Manning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1356 (stating that “demographics have\n\nplayed a significant role in Hillsborough County”). The district judge even agreed\n\nthat “[i]t [was] probable that” the 17 challenged “schools would have become racially\n\nimbalanced regardless of [Appellants’] efforts.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1303.\n\nEven Appellees’ own expert, according to the district judge, “agreed that\n\ndemographics have played a significant role in Hillsborough County.” Id. Despite\n\nall of the evidence showing that demographics, and not de jure segregation, caused\n\nthe racial imbalances, the district judge ultimately declined to find the school district\n\nunitary as to student assignments. The district judge declined to so find because she\n\ncould not conclude that demographics were the sole cause of the racial imbalances.\n\n\n                                           22\n\fSee id. at 1302. In the district judge’s view, therefore, the legal presumption remained\n\nthat any racial imbalances were the result of the prior de jure segregation. See\n\nManning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1357.\n\n            Finally, we note that the district judge’s findings were inconsistent and\n\ndifficult to follow. For example, the district judge was concerned by Dr. Clark’s data,\n\nespecially with regard to its reliability.20 See Manning, 24 F. Supp.2d at 1298-1300.\n\nNevertheless, the district judge never stated that the data — which both sides relied\n\nupon —        was so unreliable so as to undermine her finding that “a shift in\n\ndemographics [was] a substantial cause of the racial identifiability in Hillsborough\n\nCounty’s schools.” Id. at 1303. Additionally, the district judge remarked that she was\n\n“not convinced that a shift in demographics explain[ed] the racial imbalance in the\n\nHillsborough County school system.” Manning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1356; see also\n\n\n\n       20\n         In particular, the district judge noted the following:\n      [Appellants’] statistics encompass a larger segment of the population than is\n      useful to explain the deviations in the racial compositions of the unbalanced\n      schools. Specifically, [Appellants] rely on Dr. Clark’s use of school-aged children\n      from ages 0-17 to explain enrollment ratios at the elementary schools; however,\n      almost one-half of the children included in this group would not, in fact, be\n      attending an elementary school. Moreover, while a few blocks in an attendance\n      zone may reflect black school-age populations as high as 95%, those few blocks\n      only represent a small proportion of the entire attendance zone. Finally, Dr.\n      Clark's analysis does not address [Appellants'] initial decisions to draw attendance\n      zones, decisions not to act when it was apparent that those zones were\n      inappropriate, or other School Board decisions, such as, location of new schools,\n      or implementation (or lack thereof) of desegregation tools.\nManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1298.\n\n                                               23\n\fManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1293. Yet, in the very same sentence, the district judge also\n\nstated that “demographics have played a significant role in Hillsborough County.”\n\nManning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1356. In spite of these inconsistencies, we are convinced\n\nthat the district judge agreed with the magistrate judge and found that shifting\n\ndemographics was a substantial cause of the racial imbalances in Appellants’ student\n\nassignments and that Appellants did not deliberately cause the racial imbalances.\n\n      b. Good-Faith Compliance\n\n      The magistrate judge concluded that Appellants had complied in good faith\n\nwith past federal desegregation decrees, as required by Dowell and its progeny. 498\n\nU.S. at 249-50, 111 S. Ct. at 638. The magistrate judge’s conclusion was based\n\nlargely on the testimony given during the 7-day evidentiary hearing by a variety of\n\nwitnesses, including inter alia: Dr. Walter Sickles, the school superintendent from\n\n1989 to 1996; Dr. Earl Lennard, the school superintendent as of 1996; five members\n\nof the school board; Doris Reddick, the chair of the school board; Andrew Manning,\n\nthe lead plaintiff in the case since its inception; and Joanna Tokley, the president and\n\nCEO of the Urban League.\n\n      Dr. Sickles, who had been an employee of the school board since 1969, testified\n\nthat he believed the school district was unitary in the early 1990's. Dr. Sickles did not\n\nseek a declaration of unitary status at that time because he believed Appellees would\n\n\n                                           24\n\fhave opposed and impeded his effort to establish middle schools, which was his top\n\npriority. Instead, Dr. Sickles sought Appellees’ cooperation in establishing middle\n\nschools via the Task Force Report and the 1991 Consent Order. Dr. Lennard, an\n\nemployee of the school board since 1964, testified that he felt a “moral and legal\n\nobligation on the school system to continue a desegregated school system.” Five\n\nschool board members “expressed no misgivings about . . . the intent and ability of the\n\nSchool Board to continue a desegregated school system while receiving input from all\n\nmembers of the community.”\n\n      Some witnesses “voice[d] concern about what might happen in the future if\n\n[c]ourt supervision ended.” For instance, Ms. Reddick, the chair of the school board,\n\ntestified against a finding of unitary status. Nevertheless, when asked by Appellees’\n\ncounsel what would happen if the school district were found unitary, Ms. Reddick\n\nasserted, “[W]e’re going to guarantee that students will receive equal education.”\n\n      The magistrate judge found that for more than 25 years Appellants had\n\ncomplied with the court’s orders to desegregate and that not once had Appellants been\n\nfound in violation of any court order. In addition, the magistrate judge noted that\n\nAppellants had “regularly conferred [with Appellees] . . . to ensure that the school\n\nsystem was moving forwards, not backwards, toward compliance with the [c]ourt’s\n\norders.” Accordingly, “the long history of compliance with the [c]ourt’s orders”\n\n\n                                          25\n\foutweighed the “opinions and the anecdotal evidence offered by [Appellees].” In\n\nsum, the magistrate judge concluded, “The testimony of . . . most School Board\n\nmembers, as well as the current superintendent and those responsible for various\n\nfacets of school operation[,] demonstrates that [Appellants] have accepted the\n\nprinciple of racial equality and will not revert back to a dual school system.”\n\n      The district judge, however, did not adopt this finding of good faith. Since the\n\ndistrict judge did not observe any of the testimony from the evidentiary hearing,\n\nnaturally she could not evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. Instead, the district\n\njudge’s finding of bad faith centered upon two interrelated areas of concern:\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\fAppellants’ “apathy” and the lack of a majority-to-minority (MTM) transfer\n\nprogram.21 See Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1293, 1312-14.\n\n       With regard to Appellants’ “apathy,” the district judge faulted Appellants for\n\nnot “utiliz[ing] all available techniques [to desegregate] to the maximum extent\n\npracticable” and for not demonstrating “that they [were] willing to aggressively\n\ndesegregate the school district to the maximum extent practicable.” Id. at 1312, 1335.\n\nAdditionally, the district judge spoke of missed opportunities and a failure to take\n\n“affirmative steps . . . to be released from the [c]ourt’s supervision.” Id. at 1312;\n\n\n       21\n          The district judge and the magistrate judge also extensively discussed some ex parte\ncommunications between a previous presiding judge and school officials . During the\nevidentiary hearing, Dr. John Heur, a retired school board official who had been responsible for\nimplementing the July 1971 Order, testified that such communications occurred between 1972\nand 1974. The magistrate judge found that “[t]hese ex parte conversations, while unfortunate,\nwere not initiated by [Appellants] and do not demonstrate a lack of good faith.” The district\njudge agreed, finding that, “standing alone, the ex parte communications [did] not evidence bad\nfaith.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1315.\n        Additionally, Part II of the October 26, 1998, opinion is titled “Good-Faith” and\ndiscusses Appellants’ magnet programs. See id. at 1314-15. This portion of the opinion is very\nconfusing. It lists the arguments advanced by Appellees regarding magnet schools, but the\nopinion never states whether it is adopting those arguments. In the opinion of December 4,\n1998, the district judge faults Appellants for their failure to develop magnet schools and\nprograms, except for one program at Tampa Bay Technical High School. See Manning, 28\nF.Supp.2d at 1359. But neither opinion ever explains how Appellants’ actions with respect to\nmagnet programs demonstrated bad faith.\n        We therefore conclude that the district judge did not base her finding of bad faith upon\nAppellants’ magnet programs. Even if the district judge did, in fact, base her finding of bad faith\non Appellants’ magnet programs, such a finding would be clearly erroneous. In 1990,\nAppellants moved to designate a magnet school, but Appellees opposed the motion. In\nsuccessfully opposing the motion, Appellees argued that “[t]he basic structure of desegregation\nin [Appellants’] school system has remained constant and effective since 1971,\" and that a\nmagnet program would “introduce more uncertainty about whether schools will remain\ndesegregated.”\n\n                                                27\n\fManning 28 F.Supp.2d at 1359 (citing Lockett v.

Nevertheless, after a request by\n\nAppellants to clarify exactly what steps should be taken to desegregate to the\n\nmaximum extent practicable, see id. at 1355, the district judge declined to give any\n\nspecifics.\n\n      Related to the issue of apathy is the inaction demonstrated by Appellants in\n\ntheir MTM program.       As previously noted, the July 1971 Order directed the\n\nestablishment of an MTM program. See supra Part I.B.1. Under this program, a\n\nstudent who attended a school where his race was the majority would be permitted to\n\ntransfer to a school where his race was the minority. At the evidentiary hearing, Dr.\n\nJohn Miliziano, who was Appellants’ “in-house desegregation expert,” expressed\n\nignorance about the requirement to implement an MTM program:\n\n      I dealt with the Biracial Committee for many years, and no member of\n      the committee ever brought that up. And to tell you the truth, I thought\n      it was one of those things that was considered by the court and it was\n      never meant to apply. It wasn't until recently that I, a person who has\n      spent many, many years in dealing with the court order, maybe it's\n      stupidity on my part, but I didn't even know that this hidden clause —\n      this clause, not hidden, but this clause in the [July 1971 Order] meant\n      really anything.\n\nManning, 24 F. Supp.2d at 1313. The evidence also showed that, from 1977 to 1996,\n\nno student had ever applied for an MTM transfer, and Appellants had not made any\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\feffort to publicize or market the MTM program. See id. at 1314; Manning, 28\n\nF.Supp.2d at 1359.\n\n       While faulting Appellants on the MTM program, the district judge\n\nacknowledged that the July 1971 Order “did not specifically direct [Appellants] to\n\nmarket the [MTM] program.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1314. Furthermore, the\n\ndistrict judge noted (and did not dispute) that no member of the Bi-Racial Committee\n\nand no representative of Appellees had complained, prior to the mid-1990's, about the\n\nnon-availability of an MTM program. See id. at 1313 (quoting testimony of Dr.\n\nMiliziano). The district judge also found that when Appellees did raise the lack of an\n\neffective MTM program, Appellants announced the program “to the [school] district\n\nas a whole and . . . took action to publish information about the program.” Id. at 1312.\n\n       Although the district judge stated that an MTM program is an “indispensable\n\nremedy” and a “useful part of every desegregation plan,”22 id. at 1314, the district\n\njudge did not explain why this particular MTM program was needed to desegregate\n\nthe Hillsborough County school district. In fact, as previously mentioned, Dr. Stevens\n\n— Appellees’ expert who was involved in the negotiations that led to the 1991\n\nConsent Order — conceded that an MTM program would not significantly impact the\n\n       22\n          The district judge lifted this language from the Supreme Court’s opinion in Swann,\n402 U.S. at 26-27, 91 S. Ct. at 1281. In the very same opinion, however, the Supreme Court\nwarned that “[n]o per se rule can adequately embrace all the difficulties of reconciling the\ncompeting interests involved [in desegregating schools].” Id. at 26, 91 S. Ct. at 1281.\n\n                                              29\n\frace ratios at the schools Appellees were challenging as racially imbalanced.\n\nFurthermore, the Task Force Report and the 1991 Consent Order (both of which were\n\napproved by the district judge) failed to even mention the MTM program. Lastly,\n\nnotwithstanding the criticism of the MTM program, the district judge spoke favorably\n\nof Appellants’ overall desegregation efforts. See, e.g., id. at 1287 (stating that\n\n“[u]ndoubtedly, [Appellants’] desegregation efforts demonstrate significant success”);\n\n id. at 1311 (stating Appellants “deserve acknowledgment for their desegregation\n\nefforts thus far”); id. at 1312 (noting Appellants “have been relatively successful in\n\nimplementing desegregation techniques”); id. at 1325 (finding Appellants had acted\n\nin good faith with respect to faculty desegregation and commending Appellants for\n\ntaking recommendations from the Minority Recruitment Task Force).\n\n                                      II. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       Where the relief sought in the district court is the dissolution of an injunction,\n\nthe order of the district court is subject to a mixed standard of review.23 We review\n\n\n       23\n           We raised sua sponte whether appellate jurisdiction existed in this case and requested\nbriefs from the parties. Since this is an appeal of an interlocutory order of the district court\nrefusing to dissolve an injunction, we do possess jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). We\nalso raised sua sponte whether the notice of appeal was timely filed. Appellants timely filed in\nthe district court a motion to alter or amend judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). As such,\nAppellants could file their appeal until 30 days after the district court ruled on the Rule 59(e)\nmotion. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(iv). Since the Appellants complied with this time limit, we\nconclude Appellants timely filed their notice of appeal. Thus, we may hear this appeal.\n\n                                               30\n\ffor abuse of discretion the failure to dissolve an injunction as required by law. See\n\nWilson v.

Analysis\n\n      1. General Principles\n\n      Before analyzing the case before us, it is important to recall some general\n\nprinciples. In Brown I, the Supreme Court held that de jure racial segregation\n\npracticed by school districts violates the Fourteenth Amendment. See Lockett II, 111\n\nF.3d at 842 (citing Brown I, 347 U.S. at 495, 74 S. Ct. at 692). To remedy the illegal\n\nconduct, the Supreme Court ordered federal district courts to supervise local officials\n\nin desegregating school systems. See id. (citing Brown v. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n301, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 757 (1955) (Brown II)). Federal judicial supervision of local\n\nofficials, however, was intended to be a temporary measure. See id. (citing Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Dowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637 (1991)).\n\n      A desegregation order is remedial in nature, for it is the means by which victims\n\nof discriminatory conduct are restored to the position they would have occupied in the\n\nabsence of such conduct. See Missouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rather, a federal court may insist upon a racially balanced school only in\n\nthose situations where a constitutional violation has caused the school to become\n\nracially imbalanced. See id. at 494, 112 S. Ct. at 1447. As the Supreme Court\n\ninstructed 30 years ago, “[I]n the absence of a showing that either the school\n\nauthorities or some other agency of the State has deliberately attempted to fix or alter\n\ndemographic patterns to affect the racial composition of the schools, further\n\nintervention by a district court should not be necessary.” Swann, 402 U.S. at 31-32,\n\n91 S. Ct. at 1283-83. Put simply, a school board has no obligation to remedy racial\n\nimbalances caused by external factors, such as demographic shifts, which are not the\n\nresult of segregation and are beyond the board’s control. See Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 102,\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2055-56 (citing Spangler, 427 U.S. at 434, 96 S. Ct. at 2703-04; Swann,\n\n402 U.S. at 22, 91 S. Ct. at 1279).\n\n      The ultimate objective of any desegregation order is the “restoration of state and\n\nlocal authorities to the control of a school system that is operating in compliance with\n\n\n                                          33\n\fthe Constitution.”25 Id. at 89, 115 S. Ct. at 2049 (internal quotations and citation\n\nomitted). To guide district courts in assessing when it is appropriate to restore local\n\ncontrol, the concept of a “unitary” school system has evolved in federal jurisprudence.\n\nSee generally Freeman, 503 U.S. at 485-92, 112 S. Ct. at 1443-46 (1992). In\n\nevaluating whether a school system is “unitary,” a district court must carefully assess\n\nthe facts and utilize its sound discretion to determine (1) whether local authorities\n\nhave eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable, and (2)\n\nwhether local authorities have in good faith fully and satisfactorily complied with, and\n\nshown a commitment to, the desegregation plan. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 842\n\n(quoting Lee v. Etowah County Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583478\"><a href=\"/opinion/583478/anthony-t-lee-united-states-of-america-plaintiff-intervenor-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1416</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1425 (11th Cir. 1992)\n\n(citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50, 111 S. Ct. at 638)). For a district court to\n\ndetermine whether the vestiges of discrimination have been eliminated to the extent\n\n\n\n       25\n          Local control is complementary, not contradictory, to the goal of eradicating illegal\ndiscrimination from our nation’s schools. The Supreme Court has spoken to this principle:\n       Returning schools to the control of local authorities at the earliest practicable date\n       is essential to restore their true accountability in our governmental system. When\n       the school district and all state entities participating with it in operating the\n       schools make decisions in the absence of judicial supervision, they can be held\n       accountable to the citizenry, to the political process, and to the courts in the\n       ordinary course. . . . [I]t must be acknowledged that the potential for\n       discrimination and racial hostility is still present in our country, and its\n       manifestations may emerge in new and subtle forms after the effects of de jure\n       segregation have been eliminated. It is the duty of the State and its subdivisions\n       to ensure that such forces do not shape or control the policies of its school\n       systems. Where control lies, so too does responsibility.\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 490, 112 S. Ct. at 1445.\n\n                                                34\n\fpracticable, it must examine the six facets of school operation, the so-called Green\n\nfactors: student assignments, faculty assignments, staff assignments, transportation,\n\nextra-curricular activities, and facilities. See id. (citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 245, 111\n\nS. Ct. at 636 (quoting Green, 391 U.S. at 435, 88 S. Ct. at 1693)). Using its\n\ndiscretion, a court may also consider other facets. See id. (citing Freeman, 503 U.S.\n\nat 492, 112 S. Ct. at 1446).\n\n        It is not uncommon for plaintiffs in school desegregation cases to allege, as\n\nAppellees did here, that racial imbalances in student assignments, are a “vestige of\n\ndiscrimination.” Until unitary status is attained, the defendant school board has the\n\nburden of showing that any racial imbalance in the school system is not traceable, in\n\na proximate way, to the prior de jure segregation. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494, 112\n\nS. Ct. at 1447. Stated differently, once a plaintiff shows de jure segregation (as\n\nAppellees did here in 1962, see supra Part I.A), a presumption arises that all racial\n\nimbalances in a school district are the result of the de jure segregation.

See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 840-45.\n\n       26\n          We need not address every argument advanced by Appellants with which we agree.\nWe pause, however, to highlight Appellants’ contention that the district court must provide them\nwith a “precise statement” of their obligations under a consent decree. See, e.g., Jenkins, 515\nU.S. at 101, 115 S. Ct. at 2055. The district judge avoided this requirement and held that she\nwould not “tell [Appellants] which specific means to employ” for achieving unitary status.\nManning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1360; see also id. at 1355 (refusing to describe “specific action” for\nAppellants to take). Even if we were to hold that Appellants’ school district was not unitary, we\nwould nonetheless remand this case with instructions that the district court provide specific\nguidance on what steps Appellants must take to achieve unitary status. But since we conclude\nthe school district is unitary, see infra Part III, there is no need for the district judge to issue a\nstatement, precise or otherwise, on Appellants’ obligations.\n       27\n           The district judge was aware that Lockett I had been superseded by Lockett II, but she\njustified her reliance on Lockett I upon the belief that “Lockett I reiterated established principles\nof law.” Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1311. District judges in this circuit, however, are required\nto adhere to the decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court. See Fishman & Tobin, Inc. v.\nTropical Shipping & Constr. Co., ___ F.3d ___, Slip Op. No. 99-4375, at 1299 n.14 (11th Cir.\n2001).\n\n                                                  36\n\f       The district judge, in relying on Lockett I, applied the wrong legal standard.\n\nThe law does not require, as stated in Lockett I, that a school board eliminate the\n\nvestiges of past discrimination “to the maximum extent practicable.” 92 F.3d at 1101\n\n(emphasis added).         Rather, the law merely requires that the vestiges of past\n\ndiscrimination be eliminated “to the extent practicable.” Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 842\n\n(emphasis added); accord Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 90, 115 S.

Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1347 (11th Cir. 1999); Lee, 963 F.2d at 1425. The\n\ndistrict judge incorrectly referred to the “maximum extent practicable (or possible)”\n\nstandard at least 12 times in her opinion of October 24, 1998, and four times in her\n\norder of December 4, 1998. See Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1287, 1289, 1290, 1292,\n\n1293, 1301, 1312, 1326, 1334, 1335; Manning, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1356, 1359, 1360.\n\n       Accordingly, the critical issue is whether the district judge’s repeated use of the\n\nwrong legal standard sufficiently tainted or infected the findings of fact so as to strip\n\nthose findings of the insulation normally accorded under Rule 52(a). See supra Part\n\nII.A; Corley, 566 F.2d at 1001. We would not permit an inadvertent use of language\n\n\n       28\n           The district court in Jenkins stated that its goal was to integrate the school district to\nthe “maximum extent practicable” and to the “maximum potential.” 515 U.S. at 81, 101, 115\nS. Ct. at 2045, 2055. The Supreme Court expressly rejected this test and held that the proper test\nwas whether the deficiencies “attributable to prior de jure segregation had been remedied to the\nextent practicable.” Id. at 101, 115 S. Ct. at 2055.\n\n                                                 37\n\fby a district court to constitute reversible error. Here, however, we are persuaded that\n\nthe district judge’s mistake is more than mere inadvertence.29 As we discuss\n\nimmediately below, the district judge’s findings on student assignments and good faith\n\nwere tainted (and thus stripped of Rule 52(a) protection) because the district judge\n\nheld Appellants to a higher standard than the law requires.\n\n               b.     Application of Wrong Legal Standard to Finding on Student\n                      Assignments\n\n       In Lockett, the critical issue was, as it is here, whether the racial imbalances in\n\nstudent assignments precluded a finding of unitary status. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at\n\n842, 843. Lockett II held that, for a school board to rebut the presumption of de jure\n\nsegregation, the school board had to prove “the [racial] imbalances [were] not the\n\nresult of present or past discrimination on its part.” Id. at 843; see also supra Part\n\nII.B.1.     The district court in Lockett II found the school board rebutted the\n\npresumption by presenting expert demographic evidence showing the imbalances to\n\nbe the result of voluntary housing patterns and demographic change. See id. The\n\nschool board’s demographic evidence was not contradicted by plaintiffs’ experts. See\n\n\n\n\n       29\n           The phrase “to the extent practicable” is not meaningless surplusage. As the Third\nCircuit has noted, “[T]he phrase ‘to the extent practicable’ implies a reasonable limit on the\nduration of [the] federal supervision” because “extend[ing] federal court supervision indefinitely\nis neither practicable, desirable, nor proper.” Coalition to Save our Children v. State Bd. of\nEduc. of Del., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722543\"><a href=\"/opinion/722543/coalition-to-save-our-children-v-state-board-of-education-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n                                               38\n\fid. The Lockett II majority affirmed the district court’s finding as not being clearly\n\nerroneous. See id. at 844.\n\n       By contrast, Lockett I staked out a position on the law under which school\n\nboards would have been held to a higher standard. Instead of affirming, the Lockett I\n\npanel would have remanded, so the district court could have continued supervising the\n\nschool board “until such time as a reliable body of data exist[ed] to assure . . . that the\n\nschool district ha[d] desegregated its schools to the maximum extent practicable.”\n\nLockett I, 92 F.3d at 1101 (emphasis added); accord Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 844\n\n(Barkett, J. dissenting). Under Lockett I, a school board would have been required to\n\nremedy racial imbalances even when “the imbalances [were] caused by circumstances\n\nover which the school district has no control.” Lockett I, 92 F.2d at 1099 (quoted in\n\nManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1310). Moreover, according to Lockett I, to be declared\n\nunitary, it is not enough for a school board to show demographic shifts as the cause\n\nof the racial imbalances, as “demographic shifts are not necessarily independent of\n\nprior unconstitutional practices.”30 Id. at 1099 (cited in Manning, 28 F.Supp.2d at\n\n1359).\n\n\n       30\n           Judge Barkett, the author of Lockett I, further elaborated on this view in her Lockett II\ndissent. In particular, Judge Barkett wrote that it was erroneous to “assume[] that as long as a\nschool district can point to some force not directly related to a school district’s overt actions\nwhich is causing or exacerbating racial imbalances, then the resulting imbalance is not traceable\nto past practices.” Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 845 (Barkett, J. dissenting).\n\n                                                 39\n\f      Lockett I, however, is not the law of this circuit. Rather, the law of the circuit\n\nmust be distilled from Lockett II. We reiterate that, to overcome the presumption that\n\nracial imbalances are constitutionally violative, “a school board must prove that the\n\nimbalances are not the result of present or past discrimination on its part.” Lockett II,\n\n111 F.3d at 843. Lockett II stands for the proposition that a school board overcomes\n\nthis presumption when it shows that some external force, which is not the result of\n\nsegregation and is beyond the school board’s control, substantially caused the racial\n\nimbalances. See id. (upholding declaration of unitary status when district court found\n\ndemographic shifts caused racial imbalances); see also Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 102, 115\n\nS. Ct. at 2055-56; contra Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 845 (Barkett, J. dissenting)\n\n(advocating contrary proposition). Where a defendant school board shows that\n\ndemographic shifts are a substantial cause of the racial imbalances, the defendant has\n\novercome the presumption of de jure segregation. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843.\n\nCourts shall not assume that demographic shifts are a result of the past de jure\n\nsegregation. Contra Lockett I, 92 F.3d at 1099 (advocating contrary proposition);\n\nLockett II, 111 F.3d at 845 (Barkett, J. dissenting) (same). Such an assumption is\n\nimproper because “[i]t is simply not always the case that demographic forces causing\n\npopulation change bear any real and substantial relation to a de jure violation, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\flaw need not proceed on that premise.”31 Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843 (internal\n\nalterations omitted) (quoting Freeman, 503 U.S. at 496, 112 S. Ct. at 1448). Lastly,\n\na plaintiff does not undermine the strength of a defendant’s demographic evidence by\n\nmerely asserting that demographics alone do not explain the racial imbalances.32\n\nRather, for a plaintiff to preserve the presumption of de jure segregation, the plaintiff\n\nmust show that the demographic shifts are the result of the prior de jure segregation\n\nor some other discriminatory conduct.\n\n       If the district judge had applied Lockett II, rather than Lockett I, her findings of\n\nfact would have led her to the same conclusion as the magistrate judge with respect\n\nto student assignments. The district judge, like the magistrate judge, found that\n\ndemographic shifts were a “substantial” or “significant” reason for the racial\n\nimbalances and that the racial imbalances were inevitable, irrespective of Appellants’\n\nefforts. See supra Part I.B.3.a; Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1303, 1311; Manning, 28\n\nF.Supp.2d at 1356. With this finding of fact, Appellants overcame the presumption\n\nthat the racial imbalances in student assignments were the result of de jure\n\n\n\n       31\n            In addition, “[a]s the de jure violation becomes more remote in time and . . .\ndemographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely that a current racial imbalance in a school\ndistrict is a vestige of the prior de jure system.” Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843 (quoting Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 496, 112 S. Ct. at 1448) (internal alterations included).\n       32\n            It is elementary that one may not rebut extensive evidence with a scintilla of evidence.\nSee, e.g., 2 McCormick on Evidence § 338, at 416 (John W. Strong et al. eds., 5th ed. 1999).\n\n                                                 41\n\fsegregation. To preserve the presumption, Appellees were required to show that the\n\ndemographic shifts were the result of the past segregative practices or some other\n\ndiscriminatory conduct. Appellees made no such showing. The district judge never\n\nfound that the racial imbalances at the 17 challenged schools were caused by the past\n\nde jure segregation or other discriminatory acts. In fact, the district judge found the\n\nexact opposite. That is, the district judge found that Appellants did not deliberately\n\ncause the racial imbalances through segregative policies or practices. See supra Part\n\nI.B.3.a; Manning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1310. Appellees merely persuaded the district\n\njudge that demographics alone did not account for the racial imbalances. See id. at\n\n1302 (refusing to find that a “shift in demography [was] the sole cause [of] the [racial]\n\nimbalance[s]” in the school system). Such a finding is insufficient to deny Appellants\n\na declaration of unitary status.\n\n      Accordingly, by applying the correct legal standard from Lockett II to the\n\ndistrict judge’s findings of fact, we reach the same conclusion as the magistrate judge:\n\nAppellants have achieved unitary status with respect to student assignments.\n\n             c. Application of Wrong Legal Standard to Finding on Good Faith\n\n      As discussed previously, the district judge had two interrelated areas of concern\n\nwhich precluded, in her view, a finding of good faith: Appellants’ apathy and the lack\n\nof an effective MTM program. See supra Part I.B.3.b. The district judge’s reliance\n\n\n                                           42\n\fon Lockett I undoubtedly infected her finding with regard to Appellants’ alleged\n\napathy. The district judge, as noted above, expected Appellants to “desegregate the\n\npublic schools in Hillsborough County to the maximum extent practicable.” E.g.,\n\nManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1287; supra Part I.B.3.b. Such an expectation was\n\nerroneous, for the law does not require a defendant school board to take every\n\nconceivable step in attempting to desegregate. See, e.g., Freeman, 503 U.S. at 493,\n\n112 S. Ct. at 1447 (expressly rejecting premise that “heroic measures must be taken\n\nto ensure racial balance”). Thus, the district judge’s concern about Appellants’\n\nalleged “apathy” was an error of law directly traceable to her reliance upon Lockett\n\nI.\n\n      Further, Appellants’ lack of an effective MTM program does not necessarily\n\namount to a finding of bad faith. For instance, in Lockett, the school board did not\n\nimplement its MTM program until years after the desegregation decree was entered\n\nand ignored other requirements of the desegregation decree. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d\n\nat 844; Lockett I, 92 F.3d at 1100, 1101. Nonetheless, we affirmed a finding of good\n\nfaith based in part on the district court’s finding that the school board had never\n\nviolated a court order, had never been enjoined or sanctioned, and had consulted with\n\nAfrican-American members of community before modifying the student assignment\n\nplan. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843-44; contra Lockett I, 92 F.3d at 1100, 1101.\n\n\n                                         43\n\fLikewise, in the case sub judice, Appellants never violated a court order, never were\n\nsanctioned, In and consulted extensively with the African-American community,\n\nincluding Appellees, prior to implementing new student assignments under the 1991\n\nTask Force Report. See supra Parts I.B.2 & I.B.3.b. Therefore, based on Lockett II,\n\nthe district judge clearly could have found the Appellants acted in good faith,\n\nnotwithstanding the lack of a viable MTM program.\n\n       Additionally, we are persuaded that, if the district judge had followed the law\n\nas set forth in Lockett II, she would have concluded that Appellants have acted in good\n\nfaith. As we explained in Lockett II, in determining whether a school board has acted\n\nin good faith, a court should not dwell on isolated discrepancies, but rather should\n\n“consider whether the school board’s policies form a consistent pattern of lawful\n\nconduct directed to eliminating earlier violations.”33 Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843\n\n(internal quotations omitted); see also Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491, 112 S. Ct. at 1446\n\n(holding that “a court should give particular attention to the school system’s record\n\nof compliance”). Repeatedly in the October 26, 1998, opinion, the district judge\n\ncommended Appellants for their desegregation efforts. See, e.g., Manning, 24\n\n\n       33\n           The focus is on the school board’s pattern of conduct, and not isolated events, because\nthe purpose of the good-faith finding is to ensure that a school board has accepted racial equality\nand will abstain from intentional discrimination in the future. See Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843\n(citing Freeman, 503 U.S. at 498, 112 S. Ct. at 1449). Focusing on isolated aberrations blurs a\ncourt’s long-term vision.\n\n                                                44\n\fF.Supp.2d at 1287, 1311, 1312, 1325; supra Part I.B.3.b. At the end of the opinion,\n\nthe district judge further commented:\n\n       After evaluating the voluminous record in this case, the Court is\n       convinced that [Appellants] have a short road to travel [to attain unitary\n       status]. Essentially, Defendants need to demonstrate that they are willing\n       to aggressively desegregate the school district to the maximum extent\n       practicable.34\n\nManning, 24 F.Supp.2d at 1335. Based on the foregoing statement, we are convinced\n\nthat, if the district judge had applied the correct standard, she would have found (as\n\nthe magistrate judge did) that Appellants acted in good faith, notwithstanding the\n\nabsence of an effective MTM program and other possible discrepancies.\n\n       Our conclusion is buttressed by two other points. First, the MTM program, as\n\nconceded by Appellees’ expert, would have been ineffective in desegregating the 17\n\nchallenged schools.35 As such, the MTM program should have had only marginal\n\nrelevance in analyzing whether Appellants’ “policies form[ed] a consistent pattern of\n\nlawful conduct directed to eliminating earlier violations.” Lockett II, 111 F.3d at 843\n\n(emphasis added) (internal quotations and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n       34\n           In contrast to the district judge, the magistrate judge recognized that “[a] school\nboard’s affirmative duty to desegregate does not require adoption of the most desegregative\nalternative available.”\n       35\n          We are by no means suggesting that a desegregation plan cannot, or should not,\ninclude an MTM program. The Supreme Court has spoken favorably of MTM programs. See\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 26-27, 91 S. Ct. at 1281.\n\n                                                45\n\f       Second, discerning a school board’s good faith is in some respects a subjective\n\nfinding. Thus, such a finding depends in part on the judge’s personal observation of\n\nthe witnesses. The magistrate judge, not the district judge, observed all of the\n\nwitnesses at the evidentiary hearing. Granted, the district judge was free under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 636 to make a de novo determination of the magistrate judge’s findings. In\n\nother contexts, however, we have cautioned district judges from overruling a\n\nmagistrate judge’s finding where credibility determinations are dispositive. See, e.g.,\n\nProffitt v. Wainwright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"407646\"><a href=\"/opinion/407646/charles-william-proffitt-v-louie-l-wainwright-secretary-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1237 (11th Cir. 1982) (noting that, in criminal\n\nor habeas corpus cases, a district judge’s reasons for rejecting a report and\n\nrecommendation must be consistent with the credibility choices made by a\n\nmagistrate). In addition, the rationale for deferring to a district court’s finding of fact\n\nis that a trial judge is aware of the variations in demeanor which bear so heavily in\n\nmaking a subjective determination. See Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575, 105 S. Ct. at 1512.\n\nWhere, as here, a district judge does not personally observe the witnesses in making\n\na subjective finding of fact, we view such a finding with skepticism, especially where,\n\nas here, the finding is contrary to the one recommended by the judicial official who\n\nobserved the witnesses.\n\n\n\n\n                                            46\n\f                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n      The district judge’s finding that Appellants have not achieved unitary status was\n\ntainted and infected by reliance on an incorrect legal standard. As such, we reverse\n\nthe district judge’s orders of October 26, 1998, and December 4, 1998. Upon remand,\n\nthe district court shall enter judgment declaring the Hillsborough County school\n\nsystem unitary. Therefore, federal judicial supervision of the Hillsborough County\n\nschool system shall cease.\n\n      REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         47\n\f</pre>",
