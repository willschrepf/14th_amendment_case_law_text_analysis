S TAT. A NN. § 30:4-\n\n27.24–27.38. He is to be held in the custody of the Department of Corrections, and in the\n\ncare of the Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health Services, until\n\nsuch time as he is found to be no longer a risk to public safety. The crimes that got\n\nDeavers to this point are largely not relevant here, as he does not challenge his civil\n\ncommitment. He does, however, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, bring what appears to be\n\na two-pronged due process claim (both procedural and substantive) arising out of an\n\nincident that occurred at the Special Treatment Unit (“STU”) in which he was housed.\n\nThe District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, and Deavers\n\nappealed. We now affirm.1\n\n\n\n   1\n    The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and we have jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review of a district court’s grant of summary judgment is\nplenary. Doe v. Abington Friends Sch., 480 F.3d 252, 256 (3d Cir. 2007). The summary-\njudgment standard is well worn:\n       Summary judgment is proper when there is “no genuine issue as to any\n       material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter\n       of law.” F ED. R. C IV. P. 56(c). A genuine issue is present when a\n       reasonable trier of fact, viewing all of the record evidence, could rationally\n       find in favor of the non-moving party in light of his burden of proof.\n       Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322–26 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty\n\n                                              2\n\f                                             I.\n\n       Because we write only for the parties, we mention only those facts necessary to our\n\nanalysis. In brief, on December 7, 2001, Deavers brushed up against a female guard as he\n\nwas entering the STU. The nature of the contact is disputed, but the guard claims that\n\nDeavers, through both of their clothes, rubbed his penis across her buttocks. Deavers\n\ndenies that the contact was intentional or sexually motivated, and the guard did not claim\n\ndefinitively to know that it was. Regardless, the guard reported the incident to her\n\nsupervisor, and Deavers was immediately placed in Temporary Close Custody (“TCC”)\n\nfor the weekend. TCC is a form of segregation used to control “emergent situations,” and\n\nDeavers does not make any claim that his placement there at that time was improper.\n\n       Upon his removal from TCC three days later, Deavers was placed in the Restricted\n\nActivities Program (“RAP”). The RAP is described as “a program[] which restricts a\n\nresident from certain activities[] due to unacceptable behaviors, which may lead to a more\n\ndangerous behavior if not controlled or confined.” It “is not to be used as punishment,\n\nand shall only remain in place until it has been determined by the treatment staff[] that the\n\nresident will no longer engage in the unacceptable behavior.” The consequences of being\n\n\n\n\n       Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248–52 (1986). The non-moving party may not\n       merely deny the allegations in the moving party’s pleadings; instead he\n       must show where in the record there exists a genuine dispute over a\n       material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322–26. The substantive law identifies\n       which facts are material. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.\nId.\n\n                                              3\n\fplaced in the RAP are not predetermined, but “should relate to the violation.” In\n\nDeavers’s case, he was physically confined to the “tier” in which his room was located\n\n(i.e., more restrictive than “Wing RAP” and less restrictive than “Room RAP”). He was\n\nalso required to meet with a “RAP Team.” In his initial meeting with the team, Deavers\n\nprovided his explanation of the incident involving the guard, denying any intent (sexual\n\nor otherwise), and claiming that he simply misjudged the amount of space there was\n\nbetween himself and the guard as he walked through the doorway. At the end of the\n\nmeeting, Deavers was given a writing assignment: to recount his version of the incident\n\nand opine on what he might have done differently to avoid the (mis)perception of\n\nintentional sexual contact. Deavers completed the assignment satisfactorily by all\n\naccounts.\n\n       Because Deavers’s writing demonstrated that he could understand, given the\n\ncontext of the incident and his criminal history, how the guard might reasonably have\n\nperceived things differently, the RAP Team believed that he was a good candidate for\n\nfollow-up therapy in “victim empathy” (an emotion thought to be lacking in sex\n\noffenders, the demonstrated presence of which is necessary for Deavers to be released\n\nfrom his commitment). Pursuant to this, the RAP Team gave Deavers another writing\n\nassignment, this time to describe how he believed the guard felt during and as a result of\n\nthe incident. Unlike the first such assignment, Deavers did not take kindly to this one.\n\nHe refused to do it and even mounted a hunger strike. During that time, the RAP Team\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fattempted to meet with him nearly every day. After nearly a month of refusing to\n\ncomplete the second assignment, however, Deavers finally acquiesced. He turned it in to\n\nthe RAP Team on January 4, 2002, and on January 7 he was released from the RAP.\n\nDeavers filed the complaint in this suit on February 25.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       As noted at the outset, Deavers makes several arguments grounded in due process.\n\nHe first claims error in the District Court’s ruling because there was a disputed issue of\n\nfact as to whether the incident involving the guard was intentional. If it was not (as\n\nDeavers has consistently maintained), then, he argues, his placement in the RAP without\n\nan opportunity adequately to contest it violates his constitutional right to procedural due\n\nprocess. This position is inconsistent with Supreme Court and Circuit precedent. See\n\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995); Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d 532 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n       In Sandin, the Supreme Court determined that there was no cognizable liberty\n\ninterest in freedom from additional restraint in a prison setting. See 515 U.S. at 486 (“We\n\nhold that [the prisoner’s] discipline in segregated confinement did not present the type of\n\natypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty\n\ninterest.”). Put another way, unless the deprivation of liberty is in some way extreme,\n\nthen the Constitution does not require that a prisoner be afforded any process at all prior\n\nto deprivations beyond that incident to normal prison life. Our Court later extended\n\nSandin’s foreclosure of procedural due process protections to a situation like that\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fpresented here—a plaintiff civilly committed in New Jersey claiming a procedural due\n\nprocess violation by his wrongful placement in the RAP. See Leamer, 288 F.3d at 546;\n\nsee also Thielman v. Leean, 282 F.3d 478 (7th Cir. 2002) (likewise extending Sandin to\n\ncivil commitment settings). The District Court, therefore, was correct to grant summary\n\njudgment on this aspect of Deavers’s due process claim; whether he came into contact\n\nwith the female guard intentionally or accidentally is immaterial. See F ED. R. C IV. P.\n\n56(c) (“The judgment sought shall be rendered if . . . there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact . . . .” (emphasis added)); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248 (“As to materiality, the\n\nsubstantive law will identify which facts are material.”).2\n\n       Deavers’s other due process claim seems to be grounded in the notion that if the\n\nGovernment civilly commits a person for needed medical treatment, it must provide that\n\ntreatment. His specific claim is that because it would be therapeutically\n\n\n\n   2\n    We also note, however, that even if there were a cognizable liberty interest in not\nbeing wrongfully placed in the RAP, it is likely that the procedure afforded Deavers here\nwould pass constitutional muster. He was given an opportunity to present his version of\nthe incident to the RAP Team in the form of a written assignment, which he did complete.\nMoreover, at his yearly status hearing, Deavers had the opportunity in front of a neutral\ndecisionmaker, with the assistance of counsel, to stave off any truly consequential adverse\neffects from his placement in the RAP—an opportunity that yielded results, as the Judge\nconcluded that the incident here “had developed into a contretemps which appears to be\nhighly exaggerated on both sides.” Cf. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 487 (noting that any possible\nliberty interest affected by prison discipline (i.e., parole) is adequately protected by the\nparole hearing, which gives the prisoner an opportunity “to explain the circumstances\nbehind his misconduct record”). “The fundamental requirement of due process is the\nopportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” Mathews v.\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976). Deavers appears to have had such an opportunity\nhere.\n\n                                              6\n\fcounterproductive to punish him for an act he did not commit (which one of the\n\ndefendants admits it would be), the State of New Jersey failed to provide him with the\n\nmedical treatment it must provide—an obligation it acquired by way of its having civilly\n\ncommitted him. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 316–19 (1982); cf. Leamer, 288\n\nF.3d at 544–45 (noting that because “therapy is . . . an inherent and integral element to the\n\n[incarcerative] scheme, . . . [the inmate’s] liberty interest in treatment is fundamental and\n\ncognizable for purposes of [due process].”) . In short, because the defendants put\n\nDeavers in the RAP without first determining whether the contact with the female guard\n\nwas intentional, he asserts that his constitutional right to substantive due process was\n\nviolated.\n\n       We agree with the analysis of the District Court. A defendant’s right to\n\nsubstantive due process is violated when the “behavior of the governmental officer is so\n\negregious, so outrageous that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”\n\nCounty of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8 (1998). Here the record reveals no\n\nsuch thing. The RAP Team merely used an opportunity that presented itself—the incident\n\nwith the female guard—to help Deavers understand how his behavior might be perceived\n\nby those around him and to learn to empathize with those perceptions. As the Supreme\n\nCourt has stated,\n\n       [a treatment] decision, if made by a professional, is presumptively valid;\n       liability my be imposed only when the decision by the professional is such a\n       substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or\n       standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base\n\n                                              7\n\f      the decision on such a judgment.\n\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 323 (footnotes omitted). Deavers points to nothing in the record\n\nshowing that the treatment decision made by the RAP Team to have him produce two\n\nessays detailing varying perspectives on the incident—even if he did not intentionally\n\ntouch the guard—is a “substantial departure from accepted professional judgment,” id., or\n\notherwise conscience-shocking.\n\n                                     *   *   *   *   *\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f",

In brief, on December 7, 2001, Deavers brushed up against a female guard as he\n\nwas entering the STU. The nature of the contact is disputed, but the guard claims that\n\nDeavers, through both of their clothes, rubbed his penis across her buttocks. Deavers\n\ndenies that the contact was intentional or sexually motivated, and the guard did not claim\n\ndefinitively to know that it was. Regardless, the guard reported the incident to her\n\nsupervisor, and Deavers was immediately placed in Temporary Close Custody (“TCC”)\n\nfor the weekend. TCC is a form of segregation used to control “emergent situations,” and\n\nDeavers does not make any claim that his placement there at that time was improper.\n\n       Upon his removal from TCC three days later, Deavers was placed in the Restricted\n\nActivities Program (“RAP”). The RAP is described as “a program[] which restricts a\n\nresident from certain activities[] due to unacceptable behaviors, which may lead to a more\n\ndangerous behavior if not controlled or confined.” It “is not to be used as punishment,\n\nand shall only remain in place until it has been determined by the treatment staff[] that the\n\nresident will no longer engage in the unacceptable behavior.” The consequences of being\n\n\n\n\n       Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248–52 (1986). The non-moving party may not\n       merely deny the allegations in the moving party’s pleadings; instead he\n       must show where in the record there exists a genuine dispute over a\n       material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322–26. The substantive law identifies\n       which facts are material. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.\nId.\n\n                                              3\n\fplaced in the RAP are not predetermined, but “should relate to the violation.” In\n\nDeavers’s case, he was physically confined to the “tier” in which his room was located\n\n(i.e., more restrictive than “Wing RAP” and less restrictive than “Room RAP”). He was\n\nalso required to meet with a “RAP Team.” In his initial meeting with the team, Deavers\n\nprovided his explanation of the incident involving the guard, denying any intent (sexual\n\nor otherwise), and claiming that he simply misjudged the amount of space there was\n\nbetween himself and the guard as he walked through the doorway. At the end of the\n\nmeeting, Deavers was given a writing assignment: to recount his version of the incident\n\nand opine on what he might have done differently to avoid the (mis)perception of\n\nintentional sexual contact. Deavers completed the assignment satisfactorily by all\n\naccounts.\n\n       Because Deavers’s writing demonstrated that he could understand, given the\n\ncontext of the incident and his criminal history, how the guard might reasonably have\n\nperceived things differently, the RAP Team believed that he was a good candidate for\n\nfollow-up therapy in “victim empathy” (an emotion thought to be lacking in sex\n\noffenders, the demonstrated presence of which is necessary for Deavers to be released\n\nfrom his commitment). Pursuant to this, the RAP Team gave Deavers another writing\n\nassignment, this time to describe how he believed the guard felt during and as a result of\n\nthe incident. Unlike the first such assignment, Deavers did not take kindly to this one.\n\nHe refused to do it and even mounted a hunger strike. During that time, the RAP Team\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fattempted to meet with him nearly every day. After nearly a month of refusing to\n\ncomplete the second assignment, however, Deavers finally acquiesced. He turned it in to\n\nthe RAP Team on January 4, 2002, and on January 7 he was released from the RAP.\n\nDeavers filed the complaint in this suit on February 25.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       As noted at the outset, Deavers makes several arguments grounded in due process.\n\nHe first claims error in the District Court’s ruling because there was a disputed issue of\n\nfact as to whether the incident involving the guard was intentional. If it was not (as\n\nDeavers has consistently maintained), then, he argues, his placement in the RAP without\n\nan opportunity adequately to contest it violates his constitutional right to procedural due\n\nprocess. This position is inconsistent with Supreme Court and Circuit precedent. See\n\nSandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995); Leamer v.

See 515 U.S. at 486 (“We\n\nhold that [the prisoner’s] discipline in segregated confinement did not present the type of\n\natypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty\n\ninterest.”). Put another way, unless the deprivation of liberty is in some way extreme,\n\nthen the Constitution does not require that a prisoner be afforded any process at all prior\n\nto deprivations beyond that incident to normal prison life. Our Court later extended\n\nSandin’s foreclosure of procedural due process protections to a situation like that\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fpresented here—a plaintiff civilly committed in New Jersey claiming a procedural due\n\nprocess violation by his wrongful placement in the RAP. See Leamer, 288 F.3d at 546;\n\nsee also Thielman v. Leean, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776782\"><a href=\"/opinion/776782/richard-thielman-v-joseph-leean-laura-flood-jerry-bednarowski-diane/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2002) (likewise extending Sandin to\n\ncivil commitment settings). The District Court, therefore, was correct to grant summary\n\njudgment on this aspect of Deavers’s due process claim; whether he came into contact\n\nwith the female guard intentionally or accidentally is immaterial. See F ED. R. C IV. P.\n\n56(c) (“The judgment sought shall be rendered if . . . there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact . . . .” (emphasis added)); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248 (“As to materiality, the\n\nsubstantive law will identify which facts are material.”).2\n\n       Deavers’s other due process claim seems to be grounded in the notion that if the\n\nGovernment civilly commits a person for needed medical treatment, it must provide that\n\ntreatment. His specific claim is that because it would be therapeutically\n\n\n\n   2\n    We also note, however, that even if there were a cognizable liberty interest in not\nbeing wrongfully placed in the RAP, it is likely that the procedure afforded Deavers here\nwould pass constitutional muster. He was given an opportunity to present his version of\nthe incident to the RAP Team in the form of a written assignment, which he did complete.\nMoreover, at his yearly status hearing, Deavers had the opportunity in front of a neutral\ndecisionmaker, with the assistance of counsel, to stave off any truly consequential adverse\neffects from his placement in the RAP—an opportunity that yielded results, as the Judge\nconcluded that the incident here “had developed into a contretemps which appears to be\nhighly exaggerated on both sides.” Cf. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 487 (noting that any possible\nliberty interest affected by prison discipline (i.e., parole) is adequately protected by the\nparole hearing, which gives the prisoner an opportunity “to explain the circumstances\nbehind his misconduct record”). “The fundamental requirement of due process is the\nopportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” Mathews v.\nEldridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (1976). Deavers appears to have had such an opportunity\nhere.\n\n                                              6\n\fcounterproductive to punish him for an act he did not commit (which one of the\n\ndefendants admits it would be), the State of New Jersey failed to provide him with the\n\nmedical treatment it must provide—an obligation it acquired by way of its having civilly\n\ncommitted him. See Youngberg v. Romeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110746\"><a href=\"/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316–19 (1982); cf. Leamer, 288\n\nF.3d at 544–45 (noting that because “therapy is . . . an inherent and integral element to the\n\n[incarcerative] scheme, . . . [the inmate’s] liberty interest in treatment is fundamental and\n\ncognizable for purposes of [due process].”) . In short, because the defendants put\n\nDeavers in the RAP without first determining whether the contact with the female guard\n\nwas intentional, he asserts that his constitutional right to substantive due process was\n\nviolated.\n\n       We agree with the analysis of the District Court. A defendant’s right to\n\nsubstantive due process is violated when the “behavior of the governmental officer is so\n\negregious, so outrageous that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”\n\nCounty of Sacramento v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847 n.8 (1998). Here the record reveals no\n\nsuch thing. The RAP Team merely used an opportunity that presented itself—the incident\n\nwith the female guard—to help Deavers understand how his behavior might be perceived\n\nby those around him and to learn to empathize with those perceptions. As the Supreme\n\nCourt has stated,\n\n       [a treatment] decision, if made by a professional, is presumptively valid;\n       liability my be imposed only when the decision by the professional is such a\n       substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or\n       standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base\n\n                                              7\n\f      the decision on such a judgment.\n\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 323 (footnotes omitted). Deavers points to nothing in the record\n\nshowing that the treatment decision made by the RAP Team to have him produce two\n\nessays detailing varying perspectives on the incident—even if he did not intentionally\n\ntouch the guard—is a “substantial departure from accepted professional judgment,” id., or\n\notherwise conscience-shocking.\n\n                                     *   *   *   *   *\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f</pre>",
