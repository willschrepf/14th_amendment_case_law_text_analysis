An interior pavilion at the E-Centre\nprovides fixed seating for 6,200 patrons, and an uncovered\nlawn area located behind the pavilion can accommodate\napproximately 18,000 spectators who either stand or sit on\nportable chairs or blankets.\n\nAppellant William Caruso, a Vietnam veteran who uses a\nwheelchair as a result of his disability, attended a concert\nat the E-Centre on July 13, 1995. The following day,\nCaruso and the Advocates for Disabled Americansfiled a\ncomplaint in federal district court alleging, inter alia, that\nthe E-Center does not comply with Title III of the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA), Pub.L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat.\n327 (1990) (codified at 42 U.S.C. S 12181 et seq. (1994)),\nbecause: 1) the wheelchair areas in the pavilion do not\nprovide wheelchair users with lines of sight over standing\nspectators and 2) the lawn area is not wheelchair\naccessible. The District Court granted summary judgment\nin favor of the defendants on both claims.1 We now affirm\nin part and reverse in part.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Before entering final judgment, the District Court granted a motion by\nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) to intervene as plaintiff solely\nfor the purpose of appealing the District Court's ruling that the E-Centre\ndoes not need to provide wheelchair users sitting in the pavilion with\nlines of sight over standing spectators.\n\n                                  2\n\fI.\n\nTitle III of the ADA protects individuals against\ndiscrimination \"on the basis of disability in the full and\nequal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,\nadvantages, or accommodations of any place of public\naccommodation.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12182 (a). Title III requires\nthat newly constructed facilities be \"readily accessible to\nand usable by individuals with disabilities, except where an\nentity can demonstrate that it is structurally\nimpracticable.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12183. In order to carry out\nthese provisions, Congress has directed the Department of\nJustice (DOJ) to \"issue regulations . . . that include\nstandards applicable to facilities\" covered by Title III. 42\nU.S.C. 12186(b). Congress has further required that any\nstandards included by the DOJ in its regulations\"be\nconsistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements\nissued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers\nCompliance Board\" (\"Access Board\"). 42 U.S.C. S 12186(c).2\n\nPursuant to its statutory authority under Title III, the\nDOJ has issued numerous regulations, see 28 C.F.R.\nSS 36.101-36.608 (1998), one of which adopts the Access\nBoard's guidelines as the DOJ's own Standards for New\nConstruction and Alterations (\"Standards\"). See 28 CFR\nS 36.406 (referring to 28 C.F.R. S 36, App. A). Both of the\nissues in this case require us to interpret portions of the\nDOJ Standards.\n\nA. Lines of Sight\n\nAppellants contend that DOJ Standard 4.33.3, which was\nadopted after notice and comment, requires wheelchair\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The Access Board is a federal agency that was created by the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973. See 29 U.S.C. S 792(a). The Board is\ncomposed of 25 members: 13 public members appointed by the\nPresident, as well as officials of 12 federal agencies or departments. Id.\nThe Board's mission focuses on the elimination of architectural,\ntransportation, communication, and attitudinal barriers confronting\npeople with disabilities. See 29 U.S.C. S 792(b). The ADA directed the\nAccess Board to issue \"minimum guidelines\" to supplement the Board's\nexisting Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design.\n42 U.S.C. S 12204)(a).\n\n                               3\n\fseats in the E-Center pavilion to afford sightlines over\nstanding spectators. Standard 4.33.3 provides:\n\n       Placement of Wheelchair Locations. Wheelchair\n       areas shall be an integral part of any fixed seating plan\n       and shall be provided so as to provide people with\n       physical disabilities a choice of admission prices and\n       lines of sight comparable to those for members of the\n       general public. They shall adjoin an accessible route\n       that also serves as a means of egress in case of\n       emergency. At least one companion fixed seat shall be\n       provided next to each wheelchair seating area. When\n       the seating capacity exceeds 300, wheelchair spaces\n       shall be provided in more than one location. . . .\n\n28 C.F.R. S 36, App. A, 4.33.3.\n\nAppellants first argue that the plain meaning of the\nphrase \"lines of sight comparable to those for members of\nthe general public\" requires that \"if standing spectators can\nsee the stage even when other patrons stand, wheelchair\nusers, too, must be able to see the stage when other\npatrons stand.\" PVA Br. at 23. While this argument has\nconsiderable force, it does not account for the rest of the\nlanguage in Standard 4.33.3, which helps the reader to\nplace the phrase \"lines of sight comparable\" in context.\nStandard 4.33.3 is entitled \"Placement of Wheelchair\nLocations\" and includes at least two provisions concerning\nthe dispersal of wheelchair locations in facilities with fixed\nseating plans.3 In addition, one of these dispersal provisions\nappears in the same sentence that contains the \"lines of\nsight\" requirement. Given this focus on the dispersal of\nwheelchair locations, it seems plausible to read the\"lines of\nsight comparable\" requirement as follows: if a facility's\nseating plan provides members of the general public with\ndifferent lines of sight to the field or stage (e.g., lines of\nsight at a baseball game from behind the plate, on either\nside of the diamond, and from the outfield bleachers), it\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Appellants concede that the provisions in 4.33.3 requiring a \"choice of\nadmission prices\" and \"more than one location\" when \"the seating\ncapacity exceeds 300\" concern dispersal of wheelchair areas throughout\na facility. See PVA Reply Br. at 7.\n\n                                  4\n\fmust also provide wheelchair users with a comparable\nopportunity to view the field or stage from a variety of angles.4\n\nAppellants reject this suggestion that the \"lines of sight\"\nprovision might require dispersal rather than vertical\nenhancement, contending that such a reading would\nimpermissibly render other portions of Standard 4.33.3\nsuperfluous. They argue:\n\n       Standard 4.33.3 . . . contains an explicit dispersal\n       provision, wholly independent of the \"comparable\" line\n       of sight provision. It requires, in pertinent part, that\n       \"[w]heelchair areas . . . shall be provided so as to\n       provide persons with disabilities a choice of admission\n       prices.\" For facilities, such as modern sports and\n       entertainment venues, that offer tickets at a range of\n       prices depending on seating location, dispersal of\n       wheelchair locations is required by this provision.\n       Moreover, a requirement for dispersal is also derived\n       from the language in Standard 4.33.3 that \"[w]hen the\n       seating capacity exceeds 300, wheelchair spaces shall\n       be provided in more than one location.\" Construing the\n       phrase \"lines of sight comparable to those provided to\n       members of the general public\" as simply requiring\n       dispersal of wheelchair locations, as the E-Centre\n       urges, is contrary to the plain language of that\n       regulation and would deprive important parts of the\n       regulation of any meaning.\n\nPVA Reply Br. at 6-7. This attempt to divorce the \"lines of\nsight\" requirement from the two provisions in 4.33.3 that\nare indisputably about dispersion overlooks the possibility\nthat the three provisions are designed to work together so\nthat: 1) at a minimum, facilities with over 300 seats provide\nat least two wheelchair locations and 2) larger facilities\nprovide wheelchair users with the option of choosing from\namong seats that afford a variety of views for a variety of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Although not discussed by the E-Centre, there might be an additional,\ndistinct reason for concluding that the language of Standard 4.33.3 does\nnot clearly require sightlines over standing patrons: In light of the fact\nthat Standard 4.33.3 concerns the design of \"seating plans\" and \"seating\nareas,\" it seems entirely possible that the drafters were assuming seated\nspectators and not addressing the issue of standing patrons.\n\n                               5\n\fcorresponding prices. Contrary to appellants' assertion, this\nsecond result is not accomplished by the \"choice of\nadmission prices\" language alone. For, if Standard 4.33.3 is\nread in piecemeal fashion as appellants suggest, a facility,\nregardless of its size and the number of views that it offers\nto the general public, would be able to place all wheelchair\nusers in just two locations so long at it offers some choice\nof prices in those locations. See Independent Living\nResources v. Oregon Arena Corp., 982 F. Supp. 698, 743\nn.61 (D. Or. 1997).\n\nIn the end, it seems that both interpretations of the \"lines\nof sight\" language are plausible and would provide some\nbenefit to wheelchair users. Appellants' reading would\nbenefit wheelchair users by allowing them to see when\nother patrons stand. The E-Centre's reading would benefit\nwheelchair users by providing them with a greater\nopportunity to view a performance or event from a variety\nof viewpoints. Since both readings of the rule are plausible\nand are consistent with the ADA's purpose of enabling\npeople with disabilities to share equally in the benefits\nprovided by a public accommodation, we conclude that the\n\"lines of sight\" language is ambiguous.\n\nAppellants' second contention is that, even if Standard\n4.33.3 is ambiguous, the court should follow the\ninterpretation that has been given to the rule by the DOJ.\nSee Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512\n(1994) (explaining that an agency's interpretation of its own\nregulation \"must be given controlling weight unless it is\nplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\")\n(internal quotations omitted); Menkowitz v. Pottstown\nMemorial Medical Center, 154 F.3d 113, 123 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(DOJ Technical Assistance Manual entitled to deference).\nBut see id. at 525 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\"giving\nsubstantive effect to . . . a hopelessly vague regulation . . .\ndisserves the very purpose behind the delegation of\nlawmaking power to administrative agencies\"); John F.\nManning, Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to\nAgency Interpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev.\n612 (1997)(urging reexamination of the principle of judicial\ndeference to agency interpretations of regulations).\nSpecifically, appellants rely on the following statement\n\n                               6\n\fappearing in a 1994 Supplement to the DOJ's Technical\nAssistance Manual (hereinafter \"1994 TAM Supplement\"):\n\n       In addition to requiring companion seating and\n       dispersion of wheelchair locations, [Standard 4.33.3]\n       requires that wheelchair locations provide people with\n       disabilities lines of sight comparable to those for\n       members of the general public. Thus, in assembly\n       areas where spectators can be expected to stand during\n       the event or show being viewed, the wheelchair\n       locations must provide lines of sight over spectators who\n       stand. This can be accomplished in many ways,\n       including placing wheelchair locations at the front of a\n       seating section, or by providing sufficient additional\n       elevation for wheelchair locations placed at the rear of\n       seating sections to allow those spectators to see over\n       the spectators who stand in front of them.\n\n1994 DOJ TAM Supp. P III-7.5180, Conditional App. at 49\n(emphasis added).\n\nIn response, appellees maintain that the 1994 TAM\nSupplement is not an interpretive rule entitled to deference,\nbut rather, an invalid attempt to adopt a new substantive\nrequirement without notice and comment. The E-Centre\nbases this argument on the history of Standard 4.33.3,\nwhich, according to the E-Centre, reveals that the rule was\nnot intended to address the issue of lines of sight over\nstanding patrons.\n\nStandard 4.33.3 was originally proposed by the Access\nBoard on January 22, 1991. At that time, the provision\nprovided:\n\n       Placement of Wheelchair Locations. Wheelchair\n       areas shall be an integral part of any fixed seating plan\n       and shall be dispersed throughout the seating area.\n       They shall . . . be located to provide lines of sight\n       comparable to those for all viewing areas.\n\n56 Fed. Reg. 2380. In its public notice regarding the\nproposed rule, the Access Board explicitly invited comments\non the issue of sightlines over standing spectators:\n\n       Section 4.33.3 provides that seating locations for\n       people who use wheelchairs shall be dispersed\n\n                               7\n\f       throughout the seating area and shall be located to\n       provide lines of sight comparable to those for all\n       viewing areas. This requirement appears to be adequate\n       for theaters and concert halls, but may not suffice in\n       sports arenas or race tracks where the audience\n       frequently stands throughout a large portion of the game\n       or event. In alterations of existing sports arenas,\n       accessible spaces are frequently provided at the lower\n       part of a seating tier projecting out above a lower\n       seating tier or are built out over existing seats at the\n       top of a tier providing a great differential in height.\n       These solutions can work in newly constructed sports\n       arenas as well, if sight lines relative to standing\n       patrons are considered at the time of the initial design.\n       The Board seeks comments on whether full lines of\n       sight over standing spectators in sports arenas and\n       other similar assembly areas should be required.\n\n56 Fed. Reg. 2314 (emphasis added).\n\nOn February 22, 1991, the DOJ published a notice in\nwhich it proposed to adopt the Access Board's Proposed\nGuidelines \"with any amendments made by the [Access\nBoard] during the rulemaking process.\" 56 Fed. Reg. 7478-\n79. The DOJ notice stated that \"any comments\" on the\nAccess Board's Proposed Guidelines should be sent directly\nto the Board. Id. at 7479.\n\nOn July 26, 1991, the Access Board announced its\nproposed final guidelines. Along with the guidelines, the\nBoard published commentary, including two passages\nrelevant to the meaning of the \"lines of sight comparable\"\nlanguage in 4.33.3. First, the Board gave the following\nresponse to comments on dispersal:\n\n       Response. The requirements in 4.33.3 for dispersal of\n       wheelchair seating spaces have been modified.\n       Wheelchair seating spaces must be an integral part of\n       any fixed seating plan and be situated so as to provide\n       wheelchair users a choice of admission prices and lines\n       of sight comparable to those available to the rest of the\n       public. . . .\n\n56 Fed Reg. 35440. By discussing the \"lines of sight\"\nrequirement in the section of the commentary concerning\n\n                                8\n\fdispersal, the Board appeared to be indicating that it was\ntreating this requirement, like the choice of price\nrequirement, as a dispersal requirement. The Board then\nwent on to consider the issue of sightlines over standing\npatrons in a separate section of the commentary:\n\n        Comment. The [Board] asked questions reg arding\n       . . . lines of sight over standing spectators in sports\n       arenas and other similar assembly areas. . . . Many\n       commenters . . . recommended that lines of sight\n       should be provided over standing spectators.\n\n        Response. . . . The issue of lines of sight over\n       standing spectators will be addressed in guidelines 5 for\n       recreational facilities.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\nOn the same day that the Access Board issued its\nproposed guidelines, including the above comment and\nresponse seemingly deferring the issue of standing lines of\nsight, the DOJ promulgated Standard 4.33.3, which is\nworded identically to the Access Board's final proposed text,\nwhich addressed the sight-line issue. Unlike the Board, the\nDepartment did not initially express a view in its\ncommentary on the issue of sightlines over standing\nspectators. Rather, in explaining its adoption of the Access\nBoard's guidelines, the DOJ made the following general\nstatement:\n\n       The Department put the public on notice, through the\n       proposed rule, of its intention to adopt the proposed\n       [guidelines], with any changes made by the Board, as\n       the accessibility standards. As a member of the Board\n       and of its ADA Task Force, the Department\n       participated actively in the public hearings held on the\n       proposed guidelines and in preparation of both the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. It is important to note the difference between Access Board guidelines\nand DOJ guidelines. For the Access Board, guidelines are the\nsubstantive rules they develop and promulgate. Thus, in speaking of a\nfuture guideline, the Board was not referring to a future interpretation\nof\n4.33.3, but rather, a separate substantive rule it would develop. By\ncontrast, a DOJ guideline is an interpretation of a substantive rule, not\nthe substantive rule itself.\n\n                                9\n\f       proposed and final versions of [the guidelines] . . . [All]\n       comments on the Department's proposed rule . . . have\n       been addressed adequately in the final [guidelines].\n       Largely in response to comments, the Board made\n       numerous changes from its proposal.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 36, App. B, at 632-33.\n\nThe next discussion of the sightlines issue came in a\n1992 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published by the\nAccess Board. There the Board summarized what had\noccurred during the 1991 notice and comment period with\nregard to 4.33.3 and expressed its future intentions:\n\n        During the initial rulemaking, the Board requested\n       information on lines of sight at seating locations for\n       persons who use wheelchairs. . . . An overwhelming\n       majority of responses favored including a provision\n       requiring lines of sight over standing spectators in\n       sports arenas and other similar assembly areas. A few\n       commenters opposed such a provision because it\n       would be either unenforceable, add significant cost or\n       reduce seating capacity. . . . The Board intends to\n       address the issue of lines of sight over standing\n       spectators in the guidelines for recreational facilities\n       which will be proposed at a future date.\n\n        Question 17: The Board is seeking comments on the\n       design issues associated with providing integrated and\n       dispersed accessible seating locations with a clear line\n       of sight over standing spectators in arenas, stadiums or\n       other sports facilities. Clearly, not all seats in sports\n       facilities afford clear lines of sight over standing\n       spectators. Tall persons, guard railings or otherfixed\n       elements in the facility may block one's view of the\n       playing field. However, since persons with disabilities\n       have fewer choices of seating locations, should all the\n       accessible seating locations be required to have lines of\n       sight over standing spectators? Would such a\n       requirement compromise the requirement for dispersed\n       wheelchair seating by providing seating in fewer\n       locations? If maximum dispersal of accessible seating\n       locations is provided, what percentage of such locations\n       can be provided with a clear line of sight over standing\n\n                               10\n\f       spectators? The Board encourages commenters to\n       provide cost information and examples (including\n       drawings, pictures or slides) of sports facilities where\n       the accessible seating locations are dispersed,\n       integrated and provide clear lines of sight over standing\n       spectators.\n\n57 Fed. Reg. 60618 (emphasis added).\n\nBased on this regulatory history, the E-Centre contends\nthat Standard 4.33.3 was intended to leave unresolved the\nissue of lines of sight over standing spectators, and, as a\nresult, the DOJ was not entitled to \"interpret\" Standard\n4.33.3 in 1994 in a fashion that did resolve the issue of\nsightlines over standing spectators.

Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994) (courts need not\ndefer to an agency's interpretation of its own regulation if\nan \"alternative reading is compelled by . . . indications of\nthe [agency's] intent at the time of the regulation's\npromulgation\"). The E-Centre maintains that, if the DOJ\nwanted to impose a new requirement that wheelchair users\nbe able to see over standing patrons, it had to engage in\nnotice and comment, since such a requirement would\nconstitute a new substantive rule. See 5 U.S.C. S 553 (b) &\n(c) (notice and comment procedure required for substantive\nrules but not interpretive rules); DIA Navigation Co. v.\nPomeroy, 34 F.3d 1255, 1264 (3d Cir. 1994) (explaining\nthat a rule is substantive if \"the agency intends to create\nnew law, rights or duties\").\n\nAppellants dispute the E-Centre's characterization of the\n1994 DOJ statement as a \"substantive\" rule. They argue\nthat, because the DOJ did not explicitly adopt the Access\nBoard's commentary, the meaning of Standard 4.33.3 was\nnot limited by that commentary when it was adopted, and\nthus the 1994 statement does not constitute a \"change\" in\nthe requirements under 4.33.3. They also maintain that\neven if the Access Board's commentary can be attributed to\nthe DOJ, the DOJ was entitled to change its interpretation\nof Standard 4.33.3 in 1994 without notice and comment.\n\nWith regard to the threshold question of whether the\nAccess Board's commentary can be attributed to the DOJ,\nthe appellants rely on the District of Columbia Circuit's\n\n                                11\n\fanalysis in Paralyzed Veterans of America v. D.C. Arena\nL.P., 117 F.3d 579 (D.C. Cir. 1997):\n\n       If the Department, when it promulgated the regulation,\n       had said what the Board said, or even clearly adopted\n       what the Board said, it would be hard to conclude that\n       the Department did not subsequently \"amend\" the\n       regulation in violation of the APA. But Justice did not\n       do so in its statement of basis and purpose. It never\n       referred to the Board's concern, nor did it imply that its\n       regulation did not address the problem of lines of sight\n       over standing spectators. It may well be that it is a\n       plausible inference that Justice, at the time,\n       deliberately intended the regulation to mean the same\n       thing as did the Board -- but it is not a necessary\n       inference. . . . We admit the issue is not easy;\n       appellants almost but do not quite establish that the\n       Department significantly changed its interpretation of\n       the regulation when it issued the 1994 technical\n       manual.\n\nId. at 587.\n\nThe problem with this analysis is that it results in a\nconclusion that the DOJ, while aware that its proposed rule\nwas ambiguous as to an issue of concern to many\ncommenters,6 both: 1) adopted the proposed rule without\noffering any explanation as to how it resolved the disputed\nissue; and 2) later resolved the dispute by way of\ninterpretation. This result would violate an important\nprinciple discussed in the Paralyzed Veterans opinion:\n\n       It is certainly not open to an agency to promulgate\n       mush and then give it concrete form only through\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In its own commentary to Standard 4.33.3, the DOJ stated that it had\n\"thoroughly analyzed\" all of the comments received by the Board\nregarding its proposed guidelines. See 28 C.F.R. S 36, App. B, at 632.\nThe Access Board's commentary makes clear that, in response to its\nstatement that 4.33.3 \"may not suffice\" to provide lines of sight over\nstanding spectators, \"many\" comments were received, 56 Fed. Reg.\n35440, with a majority favoring the inclusion of\"a provision requiring\nlines of sight over standing spectators,\" but a few opposing such a\nprovision \"because it would be either unenforceable, add significant cost\nor reduce seating capacity.\" 57 Fed. Reg. 60618.\n\n                               12\n\f       subsequent less formal \"interpretations.\" That\n       technique would circumvent section 553, the notice\n       and comment procedures of the APA.\n\nId. at 584. While the Paralyzed Veterans court concluded\nthat the DOJ's promulgation of 4.33.3 did not violate this\nprinciple, id. at 584-85,7 we must respectfully disagree. If\nthis principle is ever violated, it would seem to be when an\nagency knows it is promulgating a rule that is ambiguous\non a substantive issue of concern to commenters, and later\ntries to resolve the issue through an interpretive rule.\n\nRather than concluding that the DOJ consciously chose\nto ignore a substantive issue regarding 4.33.3 that was\nraised in the Access Board's notice of proposed rulemaking\nand debated by commenters, we conclude that the DOJ\nimplicitly adopted the Access Board's analysis of 4.33.3.\nThis conclusion is strongly supported by the following\nfactors: 1) the DOJ referred all comments to the Board; 2)\nthe DOJ relied on the Board to make adequate changes\nbased on those comments; 3) the Board specifically\nchanged the language of 4.33.3 in response to comments\nand explained that change in its commentary; 4) the DOJ\nwas a \"member of the Board\" and \"participated actively . . .\nin preparation of both the proposed and final versions of\nthe [guidelines],\" 28 CFR Part 36, App. B, at 632; and 5)\nthe DOJ's commentary stated that the final guidelines\npromulgated by the Board adequately addressed all\ncomments. Accord Independent Living Resources v. Oregon\nArena Corporation, 982 F. Supp. 698, 741 (D. Or. 1997).\n\nIf the Access Board's views on 4.33.3 are attributed to\nthe DOJ, the remaining questions are: 1) whether these\nviews are inconsistent with the 1994 DOJ TAM\ninterpretation, and 2) whether such an inconsistency\nrenders the 1994 DOJ TAM interpretation invalid. With\nregard to the first question, the Access Board's commentary\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. The D.C. Circuit additionally relied on the fact that the defendants in\nthat case did not press the argument that Standard 4.33.3 constituted\n\"mush.\" Id. In the instant case, by contrast, the E-Centre has argued\nthat the DOJ's rule would be impermissibly vague on the issue of\nsightlines if the Access Board's commentary were not attributed to the\nDOJ. See Appellees' Br. at 33.\n\n                               13\n\ftreated the \"lines of sight\" language in 4.33.3 as a dispersal\nprovision while expressly deferring the issue of views over\nstanding patrons. See 56 Fed. Reg. 35440. Thus, as\ninterpreted by the Board, the \"lines of sight comparable\"\nlanguage requires dispersal of wheelchair seats but does\nnot address elevation of wheelchair seats to allow\nwheelchair users to see over standing spectators. By\ncontrast, the 1994 TAM Supplement interprets 4.33.3 as\nrequiring lines of sight over spectators who stand. Thus,\nthe DOJ's interpretation is inconsistent with the Access\nBoard's interpretation in that it imposes a requirement that\nhad not previously existed.\n\nTurning to the issue of an agency's ability to reinterpret\nan ambiguous regulation, we agree with the District of\nColumbia Circuit's discussion of this question in Paralyzed\nVeterans. In that case, the court rejected the DOJ's\nargument that \"an agency is completely free to change its\ninterpretation of an ambiguous regulation so long as the\nregulation reasonably will bear the second interpretation.\"\n117 F.3d at 586. The court explained:\n\n       The government argues that an agency has the same\n       latitude to modify its interpretation of a regulation as\n       it does its interpretation of a statute under Chevron.\n       We think the government is wrong. . . . Under the APA,\n       agencies are obliged to engage in notice and comment\n       before formulating regulations, which applies as well to\n       \"repeals\" or \"amendments.\" See 5 U.S.C. S 551(5). To\n       allow an agency to make a fundamental change in its\n       interpretation of a substantive regulation without notice\n       and comment obviously would undermine those APA\n       requirements. That is surely why the Supreme Court\n       has noted (in dicta) that APA rulemaking is required\n       where an interpretation \"adopt[s] a new position\n       inconsistent with . . . existing regulations.\" Shalala v.\n       Guernsey Memorial Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 100 (1995).\n\nParalyzed Veterans, 117 F.3d at 586 (emphasis added).8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Notwithstanding this principle, the Paralyzed Veterans court did not\ninvalidate the interpretation in the 1994 TAM Supplement because it\nultimately concluded that the Access Board's interpretation of 4.33.3,\nwhile probably inconsistent with the DOJ 1994 Tam Supplement\ninterpretation, was not attributable to the DOJ. 117 F.3d at 587.\n\n                               14\n\fSee also Syncor Intern. Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.3d 90, 94-95\n(D.C. Cir. 1997) (dicta) (same).9\n\nAppellants contend that this court should not follow the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit's view because it is contrary to\nSupreme Court and Third Circuit cases that allow agencies\nto change their interpretations of regulations. See PVA Br.\nat 38-43 & n.22. Most of the cases cited by the appellants,\nhowever, concern agency interpretations of statutes, not\nregulations.10 As for the cited cases that do discuss an\nagency's ability to change its mind about a regulation, they\nare readily distinguishable from the circumstances\ncontemplated by the District of Columbia Circuit and\npresent in the instant case. First, appellants rely on the\nSupreme Court's statement in a recent Medicare case that\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services was \"not\nestopped from changing a view she believe[d] to have been\ngrounded on a mistaken legal interpretation\" of a\nregulation. Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S.\n504, 517 (dicta).11 However, the inconsistency in Thomas\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. The District Court in the instant case used similar reasoning to\nconclude that the interpretation in the 1994 TAM Supplement was\ninvalid due to the lack of notice and comment:\n\n       When the \"legislative history\" of an administrative regulation\nevinces\n       an intent not to cover a certain subject matter, the notice-and-\n       comment requirements of the APA cannot be evaded merely by\n       interpreting an existing regulation to cover subject matter\n       consciously omitted from its scope.\n\n968 F. Supp. 210, 216 (D.N.J. 1997).\n\n10. See Smiley v. Citibank, 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996); Good Samaritan\nHosp. v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 417 (1993); Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S.\n173, 186 (1991); Sacred Heart Medical Center v. Sullivan, 958 F.2d 537,\n544 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\n11. This statement is dicta because the Court had already concluded\nearlier in its opinion that \"petitioner fail[ed] to present persuasive\nevidence that the Secretary has interpreted the[regulation] in an\ninconsistent manner.\" Id. at 515.\n\n                               15\n\fJefferson did not involve a \"fundamental change\" of a prior\ninterpretation that had general applicability, but rather, an\nagency's adoption of a position that was arguably\ninconsistent with some past actions taken by the Secretary\nin individual cases. See id. at 517. Appellants also rely on\nour decision in C.K. v. New Jersey Dep't of Health and\nHuman Services, 92 F.3d 171 (3d Cir. 1996), for the\nproposition that an agency head, \"in her discretion, is\nallowed to change her mind over time regarding the wisdom\nof certain programs.\" Id. at 187. C.K., however, involved\ninconsistent waiver decisions by an agency head who had\nbeen given the statutory authority to waive certain\nrequirements. Thus, like Thomas Jefferson, it did not\naddress the situation where an agency publicly announces\none interpretation of a regulation that will presumably be\napplied to all covered parties and then attempts to\nfundamentally change that interpretation. Finally,\nappellants rely on this court's decision in Beazer East, Inc.\nv. EPA, 963 F.2d 603 (3d Cir. 1992), for the proposition\nthat \"nothing in the APA prohibits an agency from adopting\nor revising an interpretation of a regulation that has been\nproperly promulgated in an adjudication and applying that\ninterpretation retroactively.\" Id. at 609. Beazer East is\ndistinguishable from the instant case for two reasons. First,\nit involved agency adjudication, which is governed by\ndifferent principles than rulemaking. See id. at 609.\nSecond, while the Beazer East court did state that agencies\ncould adopt or revise their substantive rules in\nadjudication, it made clear that it was not dealing with a\nsituation where \"the agency inconsistency interpreted a\nstandard over time or changed its interpretation.\" Id. at\n610. In fact, the court went on to explain that, if a new\ninterpretation that is inconsistent with past interpretations\n\"effectively imposes additional substantive requirements on\nthe regulated community, it should be placed directly in the\nregulations. The regulations would then be subject to notice\nand comment, with appropriate participation by the\nregulated community.\" Id. at 611 n.7 (dicta). This statement\nis entirely consistent with the District of Columbia Circuit's\nconclusion that an agency cannot effect a \"fundamental\nchange in its interpretation of a substantive regulation\nwithout notice and comment. . . .\" Paralyzed Veterans, 117\nF.3d at 586.\n\n                               16\n\fTaken together, the cases indicate that agencies can alter\nthe interpretation of their regulations in modest ways\nwithout requiring notice and comment. However, if an\nagency's new interpretation will result in significantly\ndifferent rights and duties than existed under a prior\ninterpretation, notice and comment is required. This\ndistinction, which is not precise, is akin to the distinction\nthat is generally made between substantive and interpretive\nrules. See DIA Navigation Co. v. Pomeroy, 34 F.3d 1255,\n1264 (3d Cir. 1994) (although the line between substantive\nand interpretive rules is \"incapable of being drawn with\nmuch analytical precision,\" and the tests formulated to\ndraw the line \"are often circular,\" the \"basic determination\n. . . involves whether . . . the agency intends to create new\nlaw, rights or duties\") (quotations omitted). In that context,\nwe have indicated that it is \"helpful to analyze a rule with\nan eye to the policies animating the APA's notice and\ncomment requirement.\" Id. at 1265. \"The essential purpose\nof according S 553 notice and comment opportunities is to\nreintroduce public participation and fairness to affected\nparties after governmental authority has been delegated to\nunrepresentative agencies.\" Id. (quotations omitted).\n\nIn the instant case, the public was invited to discuss a\ncertain issue during a notice and comment period, and\ncomments were submitted on both sides of the issue. The\npublic was then told that the issue would not be resolved\nby the adopted rules. A year later, the public was told that\na rule resolving the issue would be \"proposed at a future\ndate.\" 57 Fed. Reg. 60618. However, three years after the\ninitial rules were adopted, the DOJ announced, without\nexplanation and without engaging in notice and comment,\nthat it would interpret the initial rules as resolving the\nissue that had previously been left open. Such behavior is\nunfair to those who relied on agency statements that the\nissue was not being resolved by the initial rules and\ninterpreting the regulation as resolving the issue that it\nseemed plainly to have eschewed. Accordingly, we conclude\nthat the DOJ's 1994 reinterpretation constituted a\n\"fundamental change\" in interpretation that could only be\nmade by adopting a substantive rule pursuant to notice\nand comment. Since the DOJ has not followed the notice\nand comment procedures, we conclude that the E-Centre\n\n                               17\n\fdid not violate the ADA by failing to provide wheelchair\nusers with sightlines over standing patrons. If DOJ believes\nthat the ADA should be interpreted to require that\nwheelchair users be given lines of sight equivalent to\nstanding patrons -- and such a rule certainly has much to\nrecommend it -- the DOJ can accomplish this end through\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking. Indeed, the DOJ probably\ncould have achieved this end already had it followed that\ncourse initially.\n\nB. Access to the Lawn Area\n\nAppellants' second contention is that the E-Centre does\nnot comply with the ADA because there is no wheelchair\naccess to the lawn area.12 In relevant part, Title III requires\nthat the facilities of a public accommodation be\"readily\naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\nexcept where an entity can demonstrate that it is\nstructurally impracticable.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12183(a)(i). To\nimplement this mandate, the DOJ has adopted a regulation\nrequiring that \"[a]t least one accessible route . . . connect\naccessible buildings, accessible facilities, accessible\nelements, and accessible spaces that are on the same site.\"\nStandard 4.1.2(3) (emphasis added). Consistent with this\nprovision, the appellants seek \"at least one wheelchair lift\nto . . . provide access to the lawn area from the two outdoor\nplazas.\" J.A. at 90 (Paradigm Report). See also Appellants'\nBr. at 13 (arguing that \"if a ramp were built to the lawn\narea there would be greater integration of the facility\"). The\nE-Centre would appear obligated to provide such access\nunless it can demonstrate structural impracticability.\n\nThe DOJ has explained in its regulations that the\nstructural impracticability exception is reserved for \"those\nrare circumstances when the unique characteristics of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Before the District Court, Caruso also argued that the E-Centre had\nto include the capacity of the lawn area (18,000) in its calculations of\nhow many wheelchair locations to provide. The District Court rejected\nthis argument on the ground that DOJ Standard 4.1.3(19), which\nrequires that the number of wheelchair locations be equal to 1% + 1 of\na facility's capacity, only applies to assembly areas with \"fixed\nseating.\"\n968 F. Supp. at 218. Caruso has not challenged this ruling on appeal.\n\n                               18\n\fterrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.\"\n28 C.F.R. S 36.401(c). Additional guidance, some of which is\ndirectly on point, can be found in the DOJ commentary\nthat was published with the regulations:\n\n        Consistent with the legislative history of the ADA,\n       this narrow exception will apply only in rare and\n       unusual circumstances where unique characteristics of\n       terrain make accessibility unusually difficult. . . .\n       Almost all commenters supported this interpretation.\n       Two commenters argued that the DOJ requirement is too\n       limiting . . . . These commenters suggested consistency\n       with HUD's Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, which\n       generally would allow exceptions from accessibility\n       requirements, or allow compliance with less stringent\n       requirements, on sites with slopes exceeding 10%.\n\n        The Department is aware of the provisions in HUD's\n       guidelines . . . . The approach taken in these\n       guidelines, which apply to different types of\n       construction and implement different statutory\n       requirements for new construction, does not bind this\n       Department in regulating under the ADA. . . .\n\n        The limited structural impracticability exception\n       means that it is acceptable to deviate from accessibility\n       requirements only where unique characteristics of\n       terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility\n       features and where providing accessibility would\n       destroy the physical integrity of a facility. A situation in\n       which a building must be built on stilts because of its\n       location in marshlands or over water is an example of\n       one of the few situations in which the exception for\n       structural impracticability would apply.\n\n        This exception to accessibility requirements should not\n       be applied to situations in which a facility is located in\n       \"hilly\" terrain or on a plot of land upon which there are\n       steep grades. In such circumstances, accessibility can\n       be achieved without destroying the physical integrity of\n       a structure, and is required in the construction of new\n       facilities.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 36, App. B., at 649 (emphasis added).\n\n                               19\n\fThis passage indicates that public accommodations\ncannot demonstrate structural impracticability merely by\nproviding evidence of a slope of over 10%. Yet, this is\nprecisely how the E-Centre tries to show that \"it is\nimpossible to make the lawn area wheelchair accessible.\"\nAppellees' Br. at 48-49 (relying solely on the fact that the\nlawn area has a slope ranging from 12-15%). The E-Centre\nhas presented no argument as to why it cannot provide a\nramp or a lift that would enable wheelchair users to reach\nthe lawn area.13 Moreover, Caruso has introduced affidavits\nfrom people who have visited other concert venues with\nsloping grass areas that are wheelchair accessible. J.A.\n210-11.\n\nNot surprisingly, the E-Centre does not focus on the\n\"structural impracticability\" issue, and instead presses two\nother arguments. First, it contends that it need not provide\nwheelchair access to the lawn area because the DOJ\nStandards only require wheelchair seating to be provided\nwhen there is fixed seating for the general public. See\nAppellees' Br. at 46-47; see DOJ Standard 4.1.3 (19). This\nargument, however, misconstrues the issue being appealed.\nCaruso is not asking that the E-Centre be required to\nconstruct wheelchair seating areas on the lawn that comply\nwith the various requirements governing fixed seating plans.14\nRather, he is merely seeking an accessible route to the lawn\narea. Caruso is entitled to such a route under the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. The E-Centre incorrectly asserts that the Standards prohibit ramps\nto have a slope of more than 2%. The correct figure is 8.3%. Standard\n4.8.2. In any event, this number is irrelevant. Caruso is not asking for\na ramp that runs up the lawn area. Rather, he merely wants a ramp or\nlift that will provide him with access to the lawn area.\n\n14. Thus, there is no basis for the E-Centre's fear that it will have to\n\"flatten the lawn area, cover it in concrete, and divide it into seating\nrows\nto make it wheelchair accessible.\" See Appellee's Br. at 49. In fact, it\nis\nunlikely that such a requirement could ever be imposed under the ADA\nsince Title III specifically provides that facilities can refrain from\nmaking\nmodifications that \"would fundamentally alter the nature of such . . .\nfacilities.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). In any event, Caruso has made\nit clear that he is not seeking access to the lawn areas so that he can\nsit in his wheelchair on a concrete slab. Rather, he desires access so\nthat he can \"enjoy a concert on [the] grass or a blanket\" while picnicking\nwith family and friends. Appellants' Br. at 13.\n\n                               20\n\fregulations regardless of whether or not the facility is also\nrequired to meet the more specific DOJ Standards\nconcerning fixed seating plans. See 28 C.F.R. S 36.401(c)(2)\n(\"[A]ny portion of the facility that can be made accessible\nshall be made accessible to the extent that is not\nstructurally impracticable.\"); id., S 36, App. A, Standard\n4.1.1(5)(a) (same); id. Standard 4.1.2(2) (\"At least one\naccessible route . . . shall connect . . . accessible spaces\nthat are on the same site.\"). Accordingly, we reject the\nargument that assembly areas without fixed seating need\nnot provide access to people in wheelchairs.\n\nThe E-Centre's other justification for failing to provide\naccess is based on the \"Equivalent Facilitation\" provision in\nthe DOJ Standards. It states:\n\n       Departures from particular technical and scoping\n       requirements of this guideline by the use of other\n       designs and technologies are permitted where the\n       alternative designs and technologies used will provide\n       substantially equivalent or greater access to and\n       usability of the facility.\n\nDOJ Standard 2.2. The E-Centre contends that it has\nprovided \"equivalent facilitation\" for wheelchair users by\nplacing additional wheelchair locations in the interior\npavilion. See Appellees' Br. at 47-50. The District Court\nagreed and granted summary judgment for the E-Centre on\nthis basis.\n\nThe principal problem with the E-Centre's \"equivalent\nfacilitation\" argument is that it treats the ADA's\nrequirement of equal access for people with disabilities as\na \"particular technical and scoping requirement.\" This is\nsimply not the case. Rather, equal access is an explicit\nrequirement of both the statute itself and the general\nprovisions of the DOJ's regulations. See 42 U.S.C. S 12183;\n28 C.F.R. S 36.401. Properly read, the \"Equivalent\nFacilitation\" provision does not allow facilities to deny\naccess under certain circumstances, but instead allows\nfacilities to bypass the technical requirements laid out in\nthe Standards when alternative designs will provide\n\"equivalent or greater access to and usability of the facility.\"\nTherefore, we conclude that the E-Centre cannot rely on the\n\n                                21\n\f\"Equivalent Facilitation\" provision to excuse its failure to\nprovide any wheelchair access to an assembly area that\naccommodates 18,000 people.\n\nFurthermore, as noted by Caruso in his appellate brief,\nthe language of Title III itself precludes a reading of the\n\"Equivalent Facilitation\" provision that would allow venues\nto restrict wheelchair access to certain areas based on a\nbelief that wheelchair users will be better off elsewhere. See\n42 U.S.C. S 12182 (b)(1)(A)(iii) (discriminatory to provide a\nseparate benefit unless necessary to provide equal benefit);\nid. at (b)(1)(B) (benefits of a public accommodation must be\nprovided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the\nneeds of the individual). As the DOJ explains in its\ncommentary:\n\n       Taken together, [the statutory and regulatory\n       provisions concerning separate benefits and integrated\n       settings] are intended to prohibit exclusion and\n       segregation of individuals with disabilities and the\n       denial of equal opportunities enjoyed by others, based\n       on, among other things, presumptions, patronizing\n       attitudes, fears, and stereotypes about individuals with\n       disabilities. Consistent with these standards, public\n       accommodations are required to make decisions based\n       on facts applicable to individuals and not on the basis\n       of presumptions as to what a class of individuals with\n       disabilities can or cannot do. . . . Separate, special, or\n       different programs that are designed to provide a\n       benefit to persons with disabilities cannot be used to\n       restrict the participation of persons with disabilities in\n       general, integrated activities.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 36, App. B., at 622.\n\nThe District Court, in concluding that the E-Centre had\nnot violated Title III by failing to provide access to the lawn\narea, appeared to give precisely the type of justification that\nthe DOJ commentary finds repugnant to the ADA:\n\n       The E-Centre provides the disabled with higher quality\n       (i.e. closer) seats in the pavilion for the same price as\n       lawn seats. Plaintiffs do not offer any reasons why the\n       interior seats are not equivalent or superior to lawn\n       seating. In our view, the E-Centre provides equal, if not\n\n                               22\n\f       greater, access to its facility for wheelchair users in the\n       interior than it does for non-wheelchair users on the\n       lawn.\n\n968 F. Supp. at 218. On appeal, the E-Centre reiterates\nthis argument that it is acceptable to restrict wheelchair\nusers from the lawn area because they provide \"higher\nquality (i.e. closer) seats in the pavilion.\" Appellees' Br. at\n49. We reject this contention as inconsistent with the plain\nlanguage of Title III. See 42 U.S.C.S 12182(b)(1)(c)\n(\"Notwithstanding the existence of separate or different\nprograms or activities . . . an individual with a disability\nshall not be denied the opportunity to participate in such\nprograms or activities that are not separate or different.\").\nWe further conclude that the only way the E-Centre can\njustify its failure to provide access to the lawn area is by\nshowing structural impracticability. Since the E-Centre has\nnot yet made such a showing, we reverse the grant of\nsummary judgment on Caruso's lawn-access claim and\nremand for further proceedings related to this claim.\n\nII.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, we affirm the decision\nof the District Court in part, and we reverse in part, and we\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               23\n\f",

An interior pavilion at the E-Centre\nprovides fixed seating for 6,200 patrons, and an uncovered\nlawn area located behind the pavilion can accommodate\napproximately 18,000 spectators who either stand or sit on\nportable chairs or blankets.\n\nAppellant William Caruso, a Vietnam veteran who uses a\nwheelchair as a result of his disability, attended a concert\nat the E-Centre on July 13, 1995. The following day,\nCaruso and the Advocates for Disabled Americansfiled a\ncomplaint in federal district court alleging, inter alia, that\nthe E-Center does not comply with Title III of the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA), Pub.L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat.\n327 (1990) (codified at 42 U.S.C. S 12181 et seq. (1994)),\nbecause: 1) the wheelchair areas in the pavilion do not\nprovide wheelchair users with lines of sight over standing\nspectators and 2) the lawn area is not wheelchair\naccessible. The District Court granted summary judgment\nin favor of the defendants on both claims.1 We now affirm\nin part and reverse in part.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Before entering final judgment, the District Court granted a motion by\nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) to intervene as plaintiff solely\nfor the purpose of appealing the District Court's ruling that the E-Centre\ndoes not need to provide wheelchair users sitting in the pavilion with\nlines of sight over standing spectators.\n\n                                  2\n\fI.\n\nTitle III of the ADA protects individuals against\ndiscrimination \"on the basis of disability in the full and\nequal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,\nadvantages, or accommodations of any place of public\naccommodation.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12182 (a). Title III requires\nthat newly constructed facilities be \"readily accessible to\nand usable by individuals with disabilities, except where an\nentity can demonstrate that it is structurally\nimpracticable.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12183. In order to carry out\nthese provisions, Congress has directed the Department of\nJustice (DOJ) to \"issue regulations . . . that include\nstandards applicable to facilities\" covered by Title III. 42\nU.S.C. 12186(b). Congress has further required that any\nstandards included by the DOJ in its regulations\"be\nconsistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements\nissued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers\nCompliance Board\" (\"Access Board\"). 42 U.S.C. S 12186(c).2\n\nPursuant to its statutory authority under Title III, the\nDOJ has issued numerous regulations, see 28 C.F.R.\nSS 36.101-36.608 (1998), one of which adopts the Access\nBoard's guidelines as the DOJ's own Standards for New\nConstruction and Alterations (\"Standards\"). See 28 CFR\nS 36.406 (referring to 28 C.F.R. S 36, App. A). Both of the\nissues in this case require us to interpret portions of the\nDOJ Standards.\n\nA. Lines of Sight\n\nAppellants contend that DOJ Standard 4.33.3, which was\nadopted after notice and comment, requires wheelchair\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The Access Board is a federal agency that was created by the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973. See 29 U.S.C. S 792(a). The Board is\ncomposed of 25 members: 13 public members appointed by the\nPresident, as well as officials of 12 federal agencies or departments. Id.\nThe Board's mission focuses on the elimination of architectural,\ntransportation, communication, and attitudinal barriers confronting\npeople with disabilities. See 29 U.S.C. S 792(b). The ADA directed the\nAccess Board to issue \"minimum guidelines\" to supplement the Board's\nexisting Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design.\n42 U.S.C. S 12204)(a).\n\n                               3\n\fseats in the E-Center pavilion to afford sightlines over\nstanding spectators. Standard 4.33.3 provides:\n\n       Placement of Wheelchair Locations. Wheelchair\n       areas shall be an integral part of any fixed seating plan\n       and shall be provided so as to provide people with\n       physical disabilities a choice of admission prices and\n       lines of sight comparable to those for members of the\n       general public. They shall adjoin an accessible route\n       that also serves as a means of egress in case of\n       emergency. At least one companion fixed seat shall be\n       provided next to each wheelchair seating area. When\n       the seating capacity exceeds 300, wheelchair spaces\n       shall be provided in more than one location. . . .\n\n28 C.F.R. S 36, App. A, 4.33.3.\n\nAppellants first argue that the plain meaning of the\nphrase \"lines of sight comparable to those for members of\nthe general public\" requires that \"if standing spectators can\nsee the stage even when other patrons stand, wheelchair\nusers, too, must be able to see the stage when other\npatrons stand.\" PVA Br. at 23. While this argument has\nconsiderable force, it does not account for the rest of the\nlanguage in Standard 4.33.3, which helps the reader to\nplace the phrase \"lines of sight comparable\" in context.\nStandard 4.33.3 is entitled \"Placement of Wheelchair\nLocations\" and includes at least two provisions concerning\nthe dispersal of wheelchair locations in facilities with fixed\nseating plans.3 In addition, one of these dispersal provisions\nappears in the same sentence that contains the \"lines of\nsight\" requirement. Given this focus on the dispersal of\nwheelchair locations, it seems plausible to read the\"lines of\nsight comparable\" requirement as follows: if a facility's\nseating plan provides members of the general public with\ndifferent lines of sight to the field or stage (e.g., lines of\nsight at a baseball game from behind the plate, on either\nside of the diamond, and from the outfield bleachers), it\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Appellants concede that the provisions in 4.33.3 requiring a \"choice of\nadmission prices\" and \"more than one location\" when \"the seating\ncapacity exceeds 300\" concern dispersal of wheelchair areas throughout\na facility. See PVA Reply Br. at 7.\n\n                                  4\n\fmust also provide wheelchair users with a comparable\nopportunity to view the field or stage from a variety of angles.4\n\nAppellants reject this suggestion that the \"lines of sight\"\nprovision might require dispersal rather than vertical\nenhancement, contending that such a reading would\nimpermissibly render other portions of Standard 4.33.3\nsuperfluous. They argue:\n\n       Standard 4.33.3 . . . contains an explicit dispersal\n       provision, wholly independent of the \"comparable\" line\n       of sight provision. It requires, in pertinent part, that\n       \"[w]heelchair areas . . . shall be provided so as to\n       provide persons with disabilities a choice of admission\n       prices.\" For facilities, such as modern sports and\n       entertainment venues, that offer tickets at a range of\n       prices depending on seating location, dispersal of\n       wheelchair locations is required by this provision.\n       Moreover, a requirement for dispersal is also derived\n       from the language in Standard 4.33.3 that \"[w]hen the\n       seating capacity exceeds 300, wheelchair spaces shall\n       be provided in more than one location.\" Construing the\n       phrase \"lines of sight comparable to those provided to\n       members of the general public\" as simply requiring\n       dispersal of wheelchair locations, as the E-Centre\n       urges, is contrary to the plain language of that\n       regulation and would deprive important parts of the\n       regulation of any meaning.\n\nPVA Reply Br. at 6-7. This attempt to divorce the \"lines of\nsight\" requirement from the two provisions in 4.33.3 that\nare indisputably about dispersion overlooks the possibility\nthat the three provisions are designed to work together so\nthat: 1) at a minimum, facilities with over 300 seats provide\nat least two wheelchair locations and 2) larger facilities\nprovide wheelchair users with the option of choosing from\namong seats that afford a variety of views for a variety of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Although not discussed by the E-Centre, there might be an additional,\ndistinct reason for concluding that the language of Standard 4.33.3 does\nnot clearly require sightlines over standing patrons: In light of the fact\nthat Standard 4.33.3 concerns the design of \"seating plans\" and \"seating\nareas,\" it seems entirely possible that the drafters were assuming seated\nspectators and not addressing the issue of standing patrons.\n\n                               5\n\fcorresponding prices. Contrary to appellants' assertion, this\nsecond result is not accomplished by the \"choice of\nadmission prices\" language alone. For, if Standard 4.33.3 is\nread in piecemeal fashion as appellants suggest, a facility,\nregardless of its size and the number of views that it offers\nto the general public, would be able to place all wheelchair\nusers in just two locations so long at it offers some choice\nof prices in those locations. See Independent Living\nResources v. Oregon Arena Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1528250\"><a href=\"/opinion/1528250/independent-living-resources-v-oregon-arena-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 743\nn.61 (D. Or. 1997).\n\nIn the end, it seems that both interpretations of the \"lines\nof sight\" language are plausible and would provide some\nbenefit to wheelchair users. Appellants' reading would\nbenefit wheelchair users by allowing them to see when\nother patrons stand. The E-Centre's reading would benefit\nwheelchair users by providing them with a greater\nopportunity to view a performance or event from a variety\nof viewpoints. Since both readings of the rule are plausible\nand are consistent with the ADA's purpose of enabling\npeople with disabilities to share equally in the benefits\nprovided by a public accommodation, we conclude that the\n\"lines of sight\" language is ambiguous.\n\nAppellants' second contention is that, even if Standard\n4.33.3 is ambiguous, the court should follow the\ninterpretation that has been given to the rule by the DOJ.\nSee Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117865\"><a href=\"/opinion/117865/thomas-jefferson-univ-v-shalala/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 512\n(1994) (explaining that an agency's interpretation of its own\nregulation \"must be given controlling weight unless it is\nplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\")\n(internal quotations omitted); Menkowitz v.

L. Rev.\n612 (1997)(urging reexamination of the principle of judicial\ndeference to agency interpretations of regulations).\nSpecifically, appellants rely on the following statement\n\n                               6\n\fappearing in a 1994 Supplement to the DOJ's Technical\nAssistance Manual (hereinafter \"1994 TAM Supplement\"):\n\n       In addition to requiring companion seating and\n       dispersion of wheelchair locations, [Standard 4.33.3]\n       requires that wheelchair locations provide people with\n       disabilities lines of sight comparable to those for\n       members of the general public. Thus, in assembly\n       areas where spectators can be expected to stand during\n       the event or show being viewed, the wheelchair\n       locations must provide lines of sight over spectators who\n       stand. This can be accomplished in many ways,\n       including placing wheelchair locations at the front of a\n       seating section, or by providing sufficient additional\n       elevation for wheelchair locations placed at the rear of\n       seating sections to allow those spectators to see over\n       the spectators who stand in front of them.\n\n1994 DOJ TAM Supp. P III-7.5180, Conditional App. at 49\n(emphasis added).\n\nIn response, appellees maintain that the 1994 TAM\nSupplement is not an interpretive rule entitled to deference,\nbut rather, an invalid attempt to adopt a new substantive\nrequirement without notice and comment. The E-Centre\nbases this argument on the history of Standard 4.33.3,\nwhich, according to the E-Centre, reveals that the rule was\nnot intended to address the issue of lines of sight over\nstanding patrons.\n\nStandard 4.33.3 was originally proposed by the Access\nBoard on January 22, 1991. At that time, the provision\nprovided:\n\n       Placement of Wheelchair Locations. Wheelchair\n       areas shall be an integral part of any fixed seating plan\n       and shall be dispersed throughout the seating area.\n       They shall . . . be located to provide lines of sight\n       comparable to those for all viewing areas.\n\n56 Fed. Reg. 2380. In its public notice regarding the\nproposed rule, the Access Board explicitly invited comments\non the issue of sightlines over standing spectators:\n\n       Section 4.33.3 provides that seating locations for\n       people who use wheelchairs shall be dispersed\n\n                               7\n\f       throughout the seating area and shall be located to\n       provide lines of sight comparable to those for all\n       viewing areas. This requirement appears to be adequate\n       for theaters and concert halls, but may not suffice in\n       sports arenas or race tracks where the audience\n       frequently stands throughout a large portion of the game\n       or event. In alterations of existing sports arenas,\n       accessible spaces are frequently provided at the lower\n       part of a seating tier projecting out above a lower\n       seating tier or are built out over existing seats at the\n       top of a tier providing a great differential in height.\n       These solutions can work in newly constructed sports\n       arenas as well, if sight lines relative to standing\n       patrons are considered at the time of the initial design.\n       The Board seeks comments on whether full lines of\n       sight over standing spectators in sports arenas and\n       other similar assembly areas should be required.\n\n56 Fed. Reg. 2314 (emphasis added).\n\nOn February 22, 1991, the DOJ published a notice in\nwhich it proposed to adopt the Access Board's Proposed\nGuidelines \"with any amendments made by the [Access\nBoard] during the rulemaking process.\" 56 Fed. Reg. 7478-\n79. The DOJ notice stated that \"any comments\" on the\nAccess Board's Proposed Guidelines should be sent directly\nto the Board. Id. at 7479.\n\nOn July 26, 1991, the Access Board announced its\nproposed final guidelines. Along with the guidelines, the\nBoard published commentary, including two passages\nrelevant to the meaning of the \"lines of sight comparable\"\nlanguage in 4.33.3. First, the Board gave the following\nresponse to comments on dispersal:\n\n       Response. The requirements in 4.33.3 for dispersal of\n       wheelchair seating spaces have been modified.\n       Wheelchair seating spaces must be an integral part of\n       any fixed seating plan and be situated so as to provide\n       wheelchair users a choice of admission prices and lines\n       of sight comparable to those available to the rest of the\n       public. . . .\n\n56 Fed Reg. 35440. By discussing the \"lines of sight\"\nrequirement in the section of the commentary concerning\n\n                                8\n\fdispersal, the Board appeared to be indicating that it was\ntreating this requirement, like the choice of price\nrequirement, as a dispersal requirement. The Board then\nwent on to consider the issue of sightlines over standing\npatrons in a separate section of the commentary:\n\n        Comment. The [Board] asked questions reg arding\n       . . . lines of sight over standing spectators in sports\n       arenas and other similar assembly areas. . . . Many\n       commenters . . . recommended that lines of sight\n       should be provided over standing spectators.\n\n        Response. . . . The issue of lines of sight over\n       standing spectators will be addressed in guidelines 5 for\n       recreational facilities.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\nOn the same day that the Access Board issued its\nproposed guidelines, including the above comment and\nresponse seemingly deferring the issue of standing lines of\nsight, the DOJ promulgated Standard 4.33.3, which is\nworded identically to the Access Board's final proposed text,\nwhich addressed the sight-line issue. Unlike the Board, the\nDepartment did not initially express a view in its\ncommentary on the issue of sightlines over standing\nspectators. Rather, in explaining its adoption of the Access\nBoard's guidelines, the DOJ made the following general\nstatement:\n\n       The Department put the public on notice, through the\n       proposed rule, of its intention to adopt the proposed\n       [guidelines], with any changes made by the Board, as\n       the accessibility standards. As a member of the Board\n       and of its ADA Task Force, the Department\n       participated actively in the public hearings held on the\n       proposed guidelines and in preparation of both the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. It is important to note the difference between Access Board guidelines\nand DOJ guidelines. For the Access Board, guidelines are the\nsubstantive rules they develop and promulgate. Thus, in speaking of a\nfuture guideline, the Board was not referring to a future interpretation\nof\n4.33.3, but rather, a separate substantive rule it would develop. By\ncontrast, a DOJ guideline is an interpretation of a substantive rule, not\nthe substantive rule itself.\n\n                                9\n\f       proposed and final versions of [the guidelines] . . . [All]\n       comments on the Department's proposed rule . . . have\n       been addressed adequately in the final [guidelines].\n       Largely in response to comments, the Board made\n       numerous changes from its proposal.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 36, App. B, at 632-33.\n\nThe next discussion of the sightlines issue came in a\n1992 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published by the\nAccess Board. There the Board summarized what had\noccurred during the 1991 notice and comment period with\nregard to 4.33.3 and expressed its future intentions:\n\n        During the initial rulemaking, the Board requested\n       information on lines of sight at seating locations for\n       persons who use wheelchairs. . . . An overwhelming\n       majority of responses favored including a provision\n       requiring lines of sight over standing spectators in\n       sports arenas and other similar assembly areas. A few\n       commenters opposed such a provision because it\n       would be either unenforceable, add significant cost or\n       reduce seating capacity. . . . The Board intends to\n       address the issue of lines of sight over standing\n       spectators in the guidelines for recreational facilities\n       which will be proposed at a future date.\n\n        Question 17: The Board is seeking comments on the\n       design issues associated with providing integrated and\n       dispersed accessible seating locations with a clear line\n       of sight over standing spectators in arenas, stadiums or\n       other sports facilities. Clearly, not all seats in sports\n       facilities afford clear lines of sight over standing\n       spectators. Tall persons, guard railings or otherfixed\n       elements in the facility may block one's view of the\n       playing field. However, since persons with disabilities\n       have fewer choices of seating locations, should all the\n       accessible seating locations be required to have lines of\n       sight over standing spectators? Would such a\n       requirement compromise the requirement for dispersed\n       wheelchair seating by providing seating in fewer\n       locations? If maximum dispersal of accessible seating\n       locations is provided, what percentage of such locations\n       can be provided with a clear line of sight over standing\n\n                               10\n\f       spectators?

But Justice did not\n       do so in its statement of basis and purpose. It never\n       referred to the Board's concern, nor did it imply that its\n       regulation did not address the problem of lines of sight\n       over standing spectators. It may well be that it is a\n       plausible inference that Justice, at the time,\n       deliberately intended the regulation to mean the same\n       thing as did the Board -- but it is not a necessary\n       inference. . . . We admit the issue is not easy;\n       appellants almost but do not quite establish that the\n       Department significantly changed its interpretation of\n       the regulation when it issued the 1994 technical\n       manual.\n\nId. at 587.\n\nThe problem with this analysis is that it results in a\nconclusion that the DOJ, while aware that its proposed rule\nwas ambiguous as to an issue of concern to many\ncommenters,6 both: 1) adopted the proposed rule without\noffering any explanation as to how it resolved the disputed\nissue; and 2) later resolved the dispute by way of\ninterpretation. This result would violate an important\nprinciple discussed in the Paralyzed Veterans opinion:\n\n       It is certainly not open to an agency to promulgate\n       mush and then give it concrete form only through\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. In its own commentary to Standard 4.33.3, the DOJ stated that it had\n\"thoroughly analyzed\" all of the comments received by the Board\nregarding its proposed guidelines. See 28 C.F.R. S 36, App. B, at 632.\nThe Access Board's commentary makes clear that, in response to its\nstatement that 4.33.3 \"may not suffice\" to provide lines of sight over\nstanding spectators, \"many\" comments were received, 56 Fed. Reg.\n35440, with a majority favoring the inclusion of\"a provision requiring\nlines of sight over standing spectators,\" but a few opposing such a\nprovision \"because it would be either unenforceable, add significant cost\nor reduce seating capacity.\" 57 Fed. Reg. 60618.\n\n                               12\n\f       subsequent less formal \"interpretations.\" That\n       technique would circumvent section 553, the notice\n       and comment procedures of the APA.\n\nId. at 584. While the Paralyzed Veterans court concluded\nthat the DOJ's promulgation of 4.33.3 did not violate this\nprinciple, id. at 584-85,7 we must respectfully disagree. If\nthis principle is ever violated, it would seem to be when an\nagency knows it is promulgating a rule that is ambiguous\non a substantive issue of concern to commenters, and later\ntries to resolve the issue through an interpretive rule.\n\nRather than concluding that the DOJ consciously chose\nto ignore a substantive issue regarding 4.33.3 that was\nraised in the Access Board's notice of proposed rulemaking\nand debated by commenters, we conclude that the DOJ\nimplicitly adopted the Access Board's analysis of 4.33.3.\nThis conclusion is strongly supported by the following\nfactors: 1) the DOJ referred all comments to the Board; 2)\nthe DOJ relied on the Board to make adequate changes\nbased on those comments; 3) the Board specifically\nchanged the language of 4.33.3 in response to comments\nand explained that change in its commentary; 4) the DOJ\nwas a \"member of the Board\" and \"participated actively . . .\nin preparation of both the proposed and final versions of\nthe [guidelines],\" 28 CFR Part 36, App. B, at 632; and 5)\nthe DOJ's commentary stated that the final guidelines\npromulgated by the Board adequately addressed all\ncomments.

With\nregard to the first question, the Access Board's commentary\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. The D.C. Circuit additionally relied on the fact that the defendants in\nthat case did not press the argument that Standard 4.33.3 constituted\n\"mush.\" Id. In the instant case, by contrast, the E-Centre has argued\nthat the DOJ's rule would be impermissibly vague on the issue of\nsightlines if the Access Board's commentary were not attributed to the\nDOJ. See Appellees' Br. at 33.\n\n                               13\n\ftreated the \"lines of sight\" language in 4.33.3 as a dispersal\nprovision while expressly deferring the issue of views over\nstanding patrons. See 56 Fed. Reg. 35440. Thus, as\ninterpreted by the Board, the \"lines of sight comparable\"\nlanguage requires dispersal of wheelchair seats but does\nnot address elevation of wheelchair seats to allow\nwheelchair users to see over standing spectators. By\ncontrast, the 1994 TAM Supplement interprets 4.33.3 as\nrequiring lines of sight over spectators who stand. Thus,\nthe DOJ's interpretation is inconsistent with the Access\nBoard's interpretation in that it imposes a requirement that\nhad not previously existed.\n\nTurning to the issue of an agency's ability to reinterpret\nan ambiguous regulation, we agree with the District of\nColumbia Circuit's discussion of this question in Paralyzed\nVeterans. In that case, the court rejected the DOJ's\nargument that \"an agency is completely free to change its\ninterpretation of an ambiguous regulation so long as the\nregulation reasonably will bear the second interpretation.\"\n117 F.3d at 586. The court explained:\n\n       The government argues that an agency has the same\n       latitude to modify its interpretation of a regulation as\n       it does its interpretation of a statute under Chevron.\n       We think the government is wrong. . . . Under the APA,\n       agencies are obliged to engage in notice and comment\n       before formulating regulations, which applies as well to\n       \"repeals\" or \"amendments.\" See 5 U.S.C. S 551(5). To\n       allow an agency to make a fundamental change in its\n       interpretation of a substantive regulation without notice\n       and comment obviously would undermine those APA\n       requirements. That is surely why the Supreme Court\n       has noted (in dicta) that APA rulemaking is required\n       where an interpretation \"adopt[s] a new position\n       inconsistent with . . . existing regulations.\" Shalala v.\n       Guernsey Memorial Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117909\"><a href=\"/opinion/117909/shalala-v-guernsey-memorial-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (1995).\n\nParalyzed Veterans, 117 F.3d at 586 (emphasis added).8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8.

See id. at 517. Appellants also rely on\nour decision in C.K. v.

Thus, like Thomas Jefferson, it did not\naddress the situation where an agency publicly announces\none interpretation of a regulation that will presumably be\napplied to all covered parties and then attempts to\nfundamentally change that interpretation. Finally,\nappellants rely on this court's decision in Beazer East, Inc.\nv. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583353\"><a href=\"/opinion/583353/beazer-east-inc-v-united-states-environmental-protection-agency-region/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1992), for the proposition\nthat \"nothing in the APA prohibits an agency from adopting\nor revising an interpretation of a regulation that has been\nproperly promulgated in an adjudication and applying that\ninterpretation retroactively.\" Id. at 609. Beazer East is\ndistinguishable from the instant case for two reasons. First,\nit involved agency adjudication, which is governed by\ndifferent principles than rulemaking. See id. at 609.\nSecond, while the Beazer East court did state that agencies\ncould adopt or revise their substantive rules in\nadjudication, it made clear that it was not dealing with a\nsituation where \"the agency inconsistency interpreted a\nstandard over time or changed its interpretation.\" Id. at\n610. In fact, the court went on to explain that, if a new\ninterpretation that is inconsistent with past interpretations\n\"effectively imposes additional substantive requirements on\nthe regulated community, it should be placed directly in the\nregulations. The regulations would then be subject to notice\nand comment, with appropriate participation by the\nregulated community.\" Id. at 611 n.7 (dicta). This statement\nis entirely consistent with the District of Columbia Circuit's\nconclusion that an agency cannot effect a \"fundamental\nchange in its interpretation of a substantive regulation\nwithout notice and comment. . . .\" Paralyzed Veterans, 117\nF.3d at 586.\n\n                               16\n\fTaken together, the cases indicate that agencies can alter\nthe interpretation of their regulations in modest ways\nwithout requiring notice and comment. However, if an\nagency's new interpretation will result in significantly\ndifferent rights and duties than existed under a prior\ninterpretation, notice and comment is required. This\ndistinction, which is not precise, is akin to the distinction\nthat is generally made between substantive and interpretive\nrules. See DIA Navigation Co. v. Pomeroy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677799\"><a href=\"/opinion/677799/dia-navigation-company-limited-v-james-pomeroy-district-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1264 (3d Cir. 1994) (although the line between substantive\nand interpretive rules is \"incapable of being drawn with\nmuch analytical precision,\" and the tests formulated to\ndraw the line \"are often circular,\" the \"basic determination\n. . . involves whether . . . the agency intends to create new\nlaw, rights or duties\") (quotations omitted). In that context,\nwe have indicated that it is \"helpful to analyze a rule with\nan eye to the policies animating the APA's notice and\ncomment requirement.\" Id. at 1265. \"The essential purpose\nof according S 553 notice and comment opportunities is to\nreintroduce public participation and fairness to affected\nparties after governmental authority has been delegated to\nunrepresentative agencies.\" Id. (quotations omitted).\n\nIn the instant case, the public was invited to discuss a\ncertain issue during a notice and comment period, and\ncomments were submitted on both sides of the issue. The\npublic was then told that the issue would not be resolved\nby the adopted rules. A year later, the public was told that\na rule resolving the issue would be \"proposed at a future\ndate.\" 57 Fed. Reg. 60618. However, three years after the\ninitial rules were adopted, the DOJ announced, without\nexplanation and without engaging in notice and comment,\nthat it would interpret the initial rules as resolving the\nissue that had previously been left open. Such behavior is\nunfair to those who relied on agency statements that the\nissue was not being resolved by the initial rules and\ninterpreting the regulation as resolving the issue that it\nseemed plainly to have eschewed. Accordingly, we conclude\nthat the DOJ's 1994 reinterpretation constituted a\n\"fundamental change\" in interpretation that could only be\nmade by adopting a substantive rule pursuant to notice\nand comment. Since the DOJ has not followed the notice\nand comment procedures, we conclude that the E-Centre\n\n                               17\n\fdid not violate the ADA by failing to provide wheelchair\nusers with sightlines over standing patrons. If DOJ believes\nthat the ADA should be interpreted to require that\nwheelchair users be given lines of sight equivalent to\nstanding patrons -- and such a rule certainly has much to\nrecommend it -- the DOJ can accomplish this end through\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking. Indeed, the DOJ probably\ncould have achieved this end already had it followed that\ncourse initially.\n\nB. Access to the Lawn Area\n\nAppellants' second contention is that the E-Centre does\nnot comply with the ADA because there is no wheelchair\naccess to the lawn area.12 In relevant part, Title III requires\nthat the facilities of a public accommodation be\"readily\naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\nexcept where an entity can demonstrate that it is\nstructurally impracticable.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12183(a)(i). To\nimplement this mandate, the DOJ has adopted a regulation\nrequiring that \"[a]t least one accessible route . . . connect\naccessible buildings, accessible facilities, accessible\nelements, and accessible spaces that are on the same site.\"\nStandard 4.1.2(3) (emphasis added). Consistent with this\nprovision, the appellants seek \"at least one wheelchair lift\nto . . . provide access to the lawn area from the two outdoor\nplazas.\" J.A. at 90 (Paradigm Report). See also Appellants'\nBr. at 13 (arguing that \"if a ramp were built to the lawn\narea there would be greater integration of the facility\"). The\nE-Centre would appear obligated to provide such access\nunless it can demonstrate structural impracticability.\n\nThe DOJ has explained in its regulations that the\nstructural impracticability exception is reserved for \"those\nrare circumstances when the unique characteristics of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Before the District Court, Caruso also argued that the E-Centre had\nto include the capacity of the lawn area (18,000) in its calculations of\nhow many wheelchair locations to provide. The District Court rejected\nthis argument on the ground that DOJ Standard 4.1.3(19), which\nrequires that the number of wheelchair locations be equal to 1% + 1 of\na facility's capacity, only applies to assembly areas with \"fixed\nseating.\"\n968 F. Supp. at 218. Caruso has not challenged this ruling on appeal.\n\n                               18\n\fterrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.\"\n28 C.F.R. S 36.401(c). Additional guidance, some of which is\ndirectly on point, can be found in the DOJ commentary\nthat was published with the regulations:\n\n        Consistent with the legislative history of the ADA,\n       this narrow exception will apply only in rare and\n       unusual circumstances where unique characteristics of\n       terrain make accessibility unusually difficult. . . .\n       Almost all commenters supported this interpretation.\n       Two commenters argued that the DOJ requirement is too\n       limiting . . . . These commenters suggested consistency\n       with HUD's Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, which\n       generally would allow exceptions from accessibility\n       requirements, or allow compliance with less stringent\n       requirements, on sites with slopes exceeding 10%.\n\n        The Department is aware of the provisions in HUD's\n       guidelines . . . . The approach taken in these\n       guidelines, which apply to different types of\n       construction and implement different statutory\n       requirements for new construction, does not bind this\n       Department in regulating under the ADA. . . .\n\n        The limited structural impracticability exception\n       means that it is acceptable to deviate from accessibility\n       requirements only where unique characteristics of\n       terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility\n       features and where providing accessibility would\n       destroy the physical integrity of a facility. A situation in\n       which a building must be built on stilts because of its\n       location in marshlands or over water is an example of\n       one of the few situations in which the exception for\n       structural impracticability would apply.\n\n        This exception to accessibility requirements should not\n       be applied to situations in which a facility is located in\n       \"hilly\" terrain or on a plot of land upon which there are\n       steep grades. In such circumstances, accessibility can\n       be achieved without destroying the physical integrity of\n       a structure, and is required in the construction of new\n       facilities.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 36, App. B., at 649 (emphasis added).\n\n                               19\n\fThis passage indicates that public accommodations\ncannot demonstrate structural impracticability merely by\nproviding evidence of a slope of over 10%. Yet, this is\nprecisely how the E-Centre tries to show that \"it is\nimpossible to make the lawn area wheelchair accessible.\"\nAppellees' Br. at 48-49 (relying solely on the fact that the\nlawn area has a slope ranging from 12-15%). The E-Centre\nhas presented no argument as to why it cannot provide a\nramp or a lift that would enable wheelchair users to reach\nthe lawn area.13 Moreover, Caruso has introduced affidavits\nfrom people who have visited other concert venues with\nsloping grass areas that are wheelchair accessible. J.A.\n210-11.\n\nNot surprisingly, the E-Centre does not focus on the\n\"structural impracticability\" issue, and instead presses two\nother arguments. First, it contends that it need not provide\nwheelchair access to the lawn area because the DOJ\nStandards only require wheelchair seating to be provided\nwhen there is fixed seating for the general public. See\nAppellees' Br. at 46-47; see DOJ Standard 4.1.3 (19). This\nargument, however, misconstrues the issue being appealed.\nCaruso is not asking that the E-Centre be required to\nconstruct wheelchair seating areas on the lawn that comply\nwith the various requirements governing fixed seating plans.14\nRather, he is merely seeking an accessible route to the lawn\narea. Caruso is entitled to such a route under the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. The E-Centre incorrectly asserts that the Standards prohibit ramps\nto have a slope of more than 2%. The correct figure is 8.3%. Standard\n4.8.2. In any event, this number is irrelevant. Caruso is not asking for\na ramp that runs up the lawn area. Rather, he merely wants a ramp or\nlift that will provide him with access to the lawn area.\n\n14. Thus, there is no basis for the E-Centre's fear that it will have to\n\"flatten the lawn area, cover it in concrete, and divide it into seating\nrows\nto make it wheelchair accessible.\" See Appellee's Br. at 49. In fact, it\nis\nunlikely that such a requirement could ever be imposed under the ADA\nsince Title III specifically provides that facilities can refrain from\nmaking\nmodifications that \"would fundamentally alter the nature of such . . .\nfacilities.\" 42 U.S.C. S 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). In any event, Caruso has made\nit clear that he is not seeking access to the lawn areas so that he can\nsit in his wheelchair on a concrete slab. Rather, he desires access so\nthat he can \"enjoy a concert on [the] grass or a blanket\" while picnicking\nwith family and friends. Appellants' Br. at 13.\n\n                               20\n\fregulations regardless of whether or not the facility is also\nrequired to meet the more specific DOJ Standards\nconcerning fixed seating plans. See 28 C.F.R. S 36.401(c)(2)\n(\"[A]ny portion of the facility that can be made accessible\nshall be made accessible to the extent that is not\nstructurally impracticable.\"); id., S 36, App. A, Standard\n4.1.1(5)(a) (same); id. Standard 4.1.2(2) (\"At least one\naccessible route . . . shall connect . . . accessible spaces\nthat are on the same site.\"). Accordingly, we reject the\nargument that assembly areas without fixed seating need\nnot provide access to people in wheelchairs.\n\nThe E-Centre's other justification for failing to provide\naccess is based on the \"Equivalent Facilitation\" provision in\nthe DOJ Standards. It states:\n\n       Departures from particular technical and scoping\n       requirements of this guideline by the use of other\n       designs and technologies are permitted where the\n       alternative designs and technologies used will provide\n       substantially equivalent or greater access to and\n       usability of the facility.\n\nDOJ Standard 2.2. The E-Centre contends that it has\nprovided \"equivalent facilitation\" for wheelchair users by\nplacing additional wheelchair locations in the interior\npavilion. See Appellees' Br. at 47-50. The District Court\nagreed and granted summary judgment for the E-Centre on\nthis basis.\n\nThe principal problem with the E-Centre's \"equivalent\nfacilitation\" argument is that it treats the ADA's\nrequirement of equal access for people with disabilities as\na \"particular technical and scoping requirement.\" This is\nsimply not the case. Rather, equal access is an explicit\nrequirement of both the statute itself and the general\nprovisions of the DOJ's regulations. See 42 U.S.C. S 12183;\n28 C.F.R. S 36.401. Properly read, the \"Equivalent\nFacilitation\" provision does not allow facilities to deny\naccess under certain circumstances, but instead allows\nfacilities to bypass the technical requirements laid out in\nthe Standards when alternative designs will provide\n\"equivalent or greater access to and usability of the facility.\"\nTherefore, we conclude that the E-Centre cannot rely on the\n\n                                21\n\f\"Equivalent Facilitation\" provision to excuse its failure to\nprovide any wheelchair access to an assembly area that\naccommodates 18,000 people.\n\nFurthermore, as noted by Caruso in his appellate brief,\nthe language of Title III itself precludes a reading of the\n\"Equivalent Facilitation\" provision that would allow venues\nto restrict wheelchair access to certain areas based on a\nbelief that wheelchair users will be better off elsewhere. See\n42 U.S.C. S 12182 (b)(1)(A)(iii) (discriminatory to provide a\nseparate benefit unless necessary to provide equal benefit);\nid. at (b)(1)(B) (benefits of a public accommodation must be\nprovided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the\nneeds of the individual). As the DOJ explains in its\ncommentary:\n\n       Taken together, [the statutory and regulatory\n       provisions concerning separate benefits and integrated\n       settings] are intended to prohibit exclusion and\n       segregation of individuals with disabilities and the\n       denial of equal opportunities enjoyed by others, based\n       on, among other things, presumptions, patronizing\n       attitudes, fears, and stereotypes about individuals with\n       disabilities. Consistent with these standards, public\n       accommodations are required to make decisions based\n       on facts applicable to individuals and not on the basis\n       of presumptions as to what a class of individuals with\n       disabilities can or cannot do. . . . Separate, special, or\n       different programs that are designed to provide a\n       benefit to persons with disabilities cannot be used to\n       restrict the participation of persons with disabilities in\n       general, integrated activities.\n\n28 C.F.R. S 36, App. B., at 622.\n\nThe District Court, in concluding that the E-Centre had\nnot violated Title III by failing to provide access to the lawn\narea, appeared to give precisely the type of justification that\nthe DOJ commentary finds repugnant to the ADA:\n\n       The E-Centre provides the disabled with higher quality\n       (i.e. closer) seats in the pavilion for the same price as\n       lawn seats. Plaintiffs do not offer any reasons why the\n       interior seats are not equivalent or superior to lawn\n       seating. In our view, the E-Centre provides equal, if not\n\n                               22\n\f       greater, access to its facility for wheelchair users in the\n       interior than it does for non-wheelchair users on the\n       lawn.\n\n968 F. Supp. at 218. On appeal, the E-Centre reiterates\nthis argument that it is acceptable to restrict wheelchair\nusers from the lawn area because they provide \"higher\nquality (i.e. closer) seats in the pavilion.\" Appellees' Br. at\n49. We reject this contention as inconsistent with the plain\nlanguage of Title III. See 42 U.S.C.S 12182(b)(1)(c)\n(\"Notwithstanding the existence of separate or different\nprograms or activities . . . an individual with a disability\nshall not be denied the opportunity to participate in such\nprograms or activities that are not separate or different.\").\nWe further conclude that the only way the E-Centre can\njustify its failure to provide access to the lawn area is by\nshowing structural impracticability. Since the E-Centre has\nnot yet made such a showing, we reverse the grant of\nsummary judgment on Caruso's lawn-access claim and\nremand for further proceedings related to this claim.\n\nII.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, we affirm the decision\nof the District Court in part, and we reverse in part, and we\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               23\n\f</pre>",
