MARTIN, JR., Chief Circuit Judge. Lee Bollinger, Jeffrey Lehman, Dennis\nShields, the Regents of the University of Michigan and the University of Michigan Law School\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 3\n\n\nappeal the district court’s determination that the Law School’s consideration of race and ethnicity\nin its admissions decisions violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.1 The Law School contends that its interest in achieving a\ndiverse student body is compelling under Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S.\n265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978), and that its admissions policy is narrowly tailored to\nserve that interest. On appeal, the Law School is joined by the Intervenors: forty-one individuals and\nthree student groups, United for Equality and Affirmative Action, the Coalition to Defend\nAffirmative Action By Any Means Necessary, and Law Students for Affirmative Action. The\nIntervenors offer an additional justification for the Law School’s consideration of race and ethnicity\n– remedying past discrimination. Barbara Grutter, an unsuccessful applicant to the Law School, on\nbehalf of herself and others similarly situated, urges us to affirm the district court’s decision. For\nthe reasons set forth below, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court.2\n\n                                                   I.\n\n        The Law School drafted its admissions policy to comply with the Supreme Court’s opinion\nin Bakke. Adopted by the full faculty in 1992, the policy states that the Law School’s “goal is to\nadmit a group of students who individually and collectively are among the most capable students\napplying to American law schools in a given year.” It further provides that the Law School “seek[s]\na mix of students with varying backgrounds and experiences who will respect and learn from each\nother.” As part of the Law School’s policy of evaluating each applicant individually, its officials read\neach application and factor all of the accompanying information into their decision.\n\n        In identifying applicants who can be expected to succeed academically, the Law School\nevaluates a composite of the applicant’s Law School Admissions Test and undergraduate grade-point\naverage. This composite can be visualized as a grid with standardized test scores on the horizontal\naxis and grade-point average on the vertical axis. Every combination of standardized test score and\nundergraduate grade-point average is shown in a cell on this grid. Each cell reports the number of\napplicants with that particular combination of numerical qualifications, as well as the number of\noffers of admission made to the applicants in that cell. Constructed in this manner, the highest\ncombination of test scores and undergraduate grade-point averages are found in the grid’s upper\nright-hand corner. Thus, an applicant’s chance of being admitted generally increases as he or she\n\n\n       1\n        Until recently, Lee Bollinger was the president of the University of Michigan. Prior to his\npresidency, he was dean of the Law School. His successor as dean was Jeffrey Lehman. Dennis\nShields was the director of the Law School’s admission program until 1998.\n       2\n        Our decision only pertains to the case involving the Law School. We will address the\nchallenge to the University of Michigan’s admissions policy, Gratz v. Bollinger, Nos. 01-1333, 01-\n1416, 01-1418, 01-1438, in a forthcoming opinion.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 4\n\n\nmoves into the grid’s upper right-hand corner. There is no combination of grades and test scores,\nhowever, below which an applicant will automatically be denied admission, or above which\nadmission is guaranteed.\n\n\n\n        The Law School also considers “soft” variables like the enthusiasm of the recommenders,\nthe quality of the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicant’s essay, residency, leadership\nand work experience, unique talents or interests, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course\nselection. After taking these additional “soft” variables into account, the Law School sometimes\nadmits students with relatively low index scores. Its admissions policy describes two general\nvarieties of students who may be admitted with such scores – (1) “students for whom [there is] good\nreason to be skeptical of an index score based prediction” (e.g., a student with a track record of poor\nstandardized test performance, but who has an outstanding academic record) and (2) students who\n“may help achieve that diversity which has the potential to enrich everyone’s education and thus\nmake a law school class stronger than the sum of its parts.”\n\n        The Law School’s admissions policy explains that “[t]here are many possible bases for\ndiversity admissions.” For example, the policy states that particular weight might be given to “an\nOlympic gold medal, a Ph.D. in physics, the attainment of age 50 in a class that otherwise lacked\nanyone over 30, or the experience of having been a Vietnamese boat person.” The policy also offers\nthree examples of actual diversity admissions. One student was born in Bangladesh, graduated from\nHarvard with a 2.67 grade-point average, received “outstanding references” from his professors, had\nan “exceptional record of extracurricular activity,” and had Law School Admission Test scores at\nthe 46th percentile and 52nd percentile. Another was an Argentinian single mother with extensive\nbusiness experience, who graduated summa cum laude from the University of Cincinnati, who was\nfluent in four languages, and scored at the 52nd percentile on the Law School Admission Test. The\nthird applicant had a 3.99 grade-point average from the University of Florida, a Law School\nAdmission Test score at the 90th percentile, and as the daughter of Greek immigrants was “immersed\nin a significantly ethnic home life,” and fluent in three languages.\n\n        Reflecting the Law School’s goal of enrolling a diverse class, its admissions policy describes\n“a commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from\ngroups which have been historically discriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and\nNative Americans, who without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in\nmeaningful numbers.” Students from such racial and ethnic groups “are particularly likely to have\nexperiences and perspectives of special importance to our mission.” Professor Richard Lempert, the\nchair of the faculty committee that drafted the admissions policy, explained that the Law School’s\ncommitment to such diversity was not intended as a remedy for past discrimination, but as a means\nof including students who may bring a different perspective to the Law School.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 5\n\n\n         In considering race and ethnicity, the Law School does not set aside or reserve seats for\nunder-represented minority students. As Dean Jeffrey Lehman testified: “We do not have a portion\nof the class that is set aside for a critical mass of under-represented minority students.” This\ntestimony was echoed by Dennis Shields, the Law School’s former admissions director, and Erica\nMunzel, the current director of admissions, both of whom testified that the Law School does not\nstrive to admit a particular percentage of under-represented minority students. The Law School does,\nhowever, consider the number of under-represented minority students, and ultimately seeks to enroll\na meaningful number, or a “critical mass,” of under-represented minority students. According to\nDirector Munzel, “critical mass” is a number sufficient to enable under-represented minority students\nto contribute to classroom dialogue without feeling isolated. Similarly, Dean Lehman equated\n“critical mass” with sufficient numbers to ensure under-represented minority students do not feel\nisolated or like spokespersons for their race, and do not feel uncomfortable discussing issues freely\nbased on their personal experiences. Professor Lempert and Kent Syverud, the current dean of\nVanderbilt Law School and a former Michigan Law School professor, offered similar definitions of\n“critical mass.” The Law School’s witnesses also testified that “critical mass” was not a set number\nor percentage. Director Munzel stated that there is no number or percentage, or range of numbers\nor percentages, that constitute a “critical mass.” Likewise, Dean Lehman stated that “critical mass”\ncould not be fixed in terms of number or percentage.\n\n        Both the Law School and the unsuccessful applicants presented expert testimony regarding\nthe Law School’s use of race in admissions decisions. Analyzing grids of the Law School’s\nadmissions data from 1995-2000, the unsuccessful applicants’ statistical expert testified that the\nrelative odds of acceptance for Native American, African-American, Mexican-American and Puerto\nRican applicants were many times greater than for Caucasian applicants and concluded that members\nof these groups were “given an extremely large allowance for admission.”\n\n        According to the Law School’s statistical expert, eliminating race as a factor in the\nadmissions process would dramatically lower minority admissions. He predicted, for example, that\nif the Law School could not consider race, under-represented minority students would have\nconstituted only 4% of the entering class in 2000, instead of the actual enrollment figure of 14.5%.\nCiting the experience of the University of California at Berkeley after the passage of Proposition 209,\nDean Lehman echoed these predictions, testifying that he feared under-represented minority\nenrollment would drop to “token” levels if race and ethnicity could not be considered.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       This Court reviews de novo the district court’s finding that the Law School’s efforts to\nachieve a diverse student body through the consideration of race and ethnic origin is unconstitutional\nand violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Johnson v. Econ. Dev. Corp., 241 F.3d 501,\n509 (6th Cir. 2001); see also Women's Med. Prof. Corp. v. Voinovich, 130 F.3d 187, 192 (6th Cir.\n1997) (“[A]n appellate court is to conduct an independent review of the record when constitutional\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 6\n\n\nfacts are at issue.”). To survive constitutional review, the Law School’s consideration of race must\n(1) serve a compelling state interest and (2) be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See\nAdarand v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995).3\n\n                                                  A.\n\n        To determine whether the Law School’s interest in achieving a diverse student body is\ncompelling, we turn to Bakke. In Bakke, a fragmented Court determined that the Medical School of\nthe University of California at Davis, which justified its race-conscious admissions program, in part,\nas necessary to achieve a diverse student body, could not be permanently enjoined from considering\nits applicants’ race because “the State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by\na properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic\norigin.” Id. at 320.\n\n        Two distinct opinions support Bakke’s judgment on this issue: Justice Powell’s opinion\nannouncing the judgment of the Court, id. at 269-324, and Justice Brennan’s opinion concurring in\nthe judgment in part and dissenting in part, in which Justices White, Marshall, and Blackmun joined,\nid. at 324-79.\n\n         Applying intermediate scrutiny, the Brennan concurrence found Davis could constitutionally\njustify its consideration of race as an effort to remedy the effects of societal discrimination. Id. at\n362. Applying strict scrutiny, Justice Powell found “the attainment of a diverse student body . . .\nclearly is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education.” Id. at 311-312.\n\n        Justice Powell recognized that a diverse student body promotes an atmosphere of\n“speculation, experiment and creation” that is “essential to the quality of higher education.” Id. at\n312 (quoting Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957)\n(Frankfurter, J. concurring)). Moreover, he noted that, by enriching students’ education with a\nvariety of perspectives, experiences, and ideas, a university with a diverse student body helps equip\nits students to be productive members of society. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 313 (“[I]t is not too much to\nsay that the ‘nation’s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure’ to the ideas and\nmores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.”) (quoting Keyishian v. Board of\nRegents, 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967)). Accordingly, he concluded “the\ninterest of diversity is compelling in the context of a university’s admission program.” Id. at 314.\n\n\n\n       3\n        Because Title VI, which prohibits racial discrimination in programs receiving federal funds,\nproscribes only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause, this court\nneed only address whether the Law School’s admissions program is constitutional. See Alexander\nv. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 7\n\n\n        Justice Powell’s recognition of the compelling nature of the state’s interest in a diverse\nstudent body was not limited to undergraduate admissions: “[E]ven at the graduate level, our\ntradition and experience lend support to the view that the contribution of diversity is substantial.”\nId. Quoting Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 634, 70 S.Ct. 848, 94 L.Ed. 1114 (1950), he observed:\n“The law school, the proving ground for legal learning and practice, cannot be effective in isolation\nfrom the individuals and institutions with which the law interacts.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314.\n\n         The district court did not dispute the merits of student body diversity. Rather, it\nacknowledged “[t]he evidence defendants submitted . . . demonstrated that the educational\natmosphere at the law school is improved by the presence of students who represent the greatest\npossible variety of backgrounds and viewpoints.” Grutter v. Bollinger, 137 F. Supp. 2d 821, 849\n(E.D. Mich. 2001). Nevertheless, it held that achieving a diverse student body is not a compelling\nstate interest because (1) it was not bound by Justice Powell’s conclusion in Bakke, and (2) achieving\na diverse student body cannot be a compelling state interest because the Supreme Court has\nsuggested that the only such interest is remedying specific instances of discrimination. See id. at\n847-48.\n\n       Because Justice Powell’s opinion is binding on this court under Marks v. United States, 430\nU.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977), and because Bakke remains the law until the\nSupreme Court instructs otherwise, we reject the district court’s conclusion and find that the Law\nSchool has a compelling interest in achieving a diverse student body. 4\n\n                                                 1.\n\n        “When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys\nthe assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those\nMembers who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.” Marks, 430 U.S. at 193\n(citation and internal punctuation omitted). In Marks, the Court interpreted its fragmented decision\nin Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966), reversing the\nMassachusetts Supreme Court’s holding that a book depicting a prostitute’s life was suppressible\nobscenity. Three distinct rationales supported Memoirs’s judgment, each representing a different\nview as to the scope of First Amendment protection afforded sexually explicit expression:\n(1) Justices Brennan and Fortas and the Chief Justice found the book was not suppressible obscenity\nbecause it was not “utterly without redeeming social value,” see id. at 419; (2) Justice Stewart found\nthe book was not suppressible obscenity because it was not hardcore pornography, see id. at 421; and\n(3) Justices Black and Douglas did not reach the issue of whether the book was suppressible\n\n\n       4\n        Because we hold that the Law School has a compelling interest in achieving a diverse\nstudent body, we do not address whether the Intervenors’ proffered interest – an interest in\nremedying past discrimination – is sufficiently compelling for equal protection purposes.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 8\n\n\nobscenity because they believed the First Amendment provides an absolute shield against\ngovernment regulation of expression, see id. at 421, 424-28 (opinions of Black, J. and Douglas, J.).\nSee also Marks, 430 U.S. at 194. The Marks Court determined that the Brennan plurality opinion,\nwhich provided the most limited First Amendment protection, “constituted the holding of the\n[Memoirs] Court and provided the governing standards” because it was the narrowest rationale for\nthe Memoirs judgment.5 Id. at 193-94.\n\n        The district court declined to apply the Marks analysis to Bakke because Justice Powell’s\nrationale was not “subsumed” in that of the Brennan concurrence. See Grutter, 137 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n\n        5\n         Because the Marks Court identified the Memoirs opinion with the most limited scope of\nFirst Amendment protection as the “narrowest,” the dissent suggests that the most narrow opinion\nunder Marks must invariably be “that which construe[s] the constitutional provision in question less\npotently.” Dissenting Op. at 52 (Boggs, J.). Application of the dissent’s cookie-cutter conception\nof Marks narrowness would preclude consideration of a given decision’s actual gravamen.\nMoreover, the dissent’s narrowness conception conflicts with both Supreme Court precedent, see\nCity of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Co., 486 U.S. 750, 764-65 n.9, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771\n(1988), and our own, see Simmons-Harris v. Zelman, 234 F.3d 945, 956-57 (6th Cir. 2000).\n        In Lakewood, the Court examined Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 69 S.Ct. 448, 93 L.Ed. 513\n(1948). In Kovacs, a plurality of the Court found that an ordinance flatly prohibiting the use of\nsound trucks was constitutional. Id. at 82-85, 89 (plurality opinion of Reed, J.). Two Justices agreed\nthat the flat-prohibition ordinance was constitutional, but reasoned that an ordinance giving a\nlicensing official unfettered discretion to prohibit the use of sound trucks – that is, an ordinance that\nwould be more conducive to content-based censorship – would also be constitutional. Id. at 89-90,\n98 (opinions of Frankfurter, J. and Jackson, J.). Because the plurality would find discretionary-\nprohibition statutes unconstitutional but would permit flat-prohibition statutes and the concurring\nJustices would find both statutes constitutional, the concurring opinions would be “narrower” under\nthe dissent’s conception of Marks. The Supreme Court applied Marks differently: “Clearly, in\nKovacs, the plurality opinion puts forth the narrowest rationale for the Court’s judgment.”\nLakewood, 486 U.S. at 764 n.9; see also Zelman, 234 F.3d at 956-57 (examining Mitchell v. Helms,\n530 U.S. 793, 120 S.Ct. 2530, 147 L.Ed.2d 660 (2000), and concluding that Justice O’Connor’s\nconcurrence – which would require more than a showing of neutrality to find government aid to\nreligious schools constitutional – was narrower than the plurality opinion – which would apparently\nfind that neutrality alone renders such aid constitutional); cf. Discovery Network, Inc. v. City of\nCincinnati, 946 F.2d 464, 470 n.9 (6th Cir. 1991) (examining Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego,\n453 U.S. 490, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981)), and citing Lakewood and Marks for the\nproposition that this court is not bound by the Metromedia plurality’s reasoning that an ordinance,\nwhich unconstitutionally regulated non-commercial speech, would be constitutional as applied to\ncommercial speech because the concurrence argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional as\napplied to both commercial and non-commercial speech).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 9\n\n\n847 (“There is simply no overlap between the two rationales”). Accordingly, it found that “Justice\nPowell's discussion of the diversity rationale is not among the governing standards to be gleaned\nfrom Bakke.” Id.\n\n        The Marks Court’s treatment of the divergent Memoirs rationales, however, demonstrates\nthat the rationales supporting the Court’s judgment need not overlap on essential points in order to\nprovide a holding that binds lower courts. Indeed, if the Justices agreed on essential points, the\nMarks analysis would be unnecessary. Cf. Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282, 121 S.Ct.\n1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001) (citing discrete portions of the opinions of Justice Powell and the\nBrennan concurrence for the proposition that the Bakke Court determined Title VI’s coverage is\ncoextensive with that of the Equal Protection Clause).\n\n       The Marks Court adopted the “utterly without redeeming social value” test as the Memoirs\nholding even though, by rejecting the possibility of suppression, Justices Black and Douglas rejected\nthe possibility of any test for identifying suppressible obscenity. In contrast to Justices Black and\nDouglas in Memoirs, the Brennan concurrence did not assert that Davis’s admissions program was\nwholly insulated from review. In fact, the Brennan concurrence agreed with Justice Powell that\nDavis’s admissions program was subject to heightened scrutiny, see Bakke, 438 U.S. at 359\n(advocating intermediate scrutiny); it expressly disagreed only with his application of strict scrutiny.\nBecause Bakke is, if anything, more susceptible to the Marks analysis than the case examined in\nMarks itself, we find the district court erred in failing to analyze Bakke under Marks.\n\n        The Bakke Court addressed the permissibility of racial classifications in academic admissions\nprograms. Under the Brennan concurrence’s rationale, the more permissive intermediate scrutiny\nstandard would apply to “benign” racial classifications. Id. Under Justice Powell’s rationale, strict\nscrutiny would apply to all racial classifications. Id. at 304-07. Because the set of constitutionally\npermissible racial classifications under intermediate scrutiny by definition includes those\nclassifications constitutionally permissible under strict scrutiny, Justice Powell’s rationale would\npermit the most limited consideration of race; therefore, it is Bakke’s narrowest rationale.\nAccordingly, Justice Powell’s opinion constitutes Bakke’s holding and provides the governing\nstandard here.6 See Marks, 430 U.S. at 193-94; see also Triplett Grille, Inc. v. City of Akron, 40 F.3d\n\n\n       6\n         The “narrowest” rationale of a case under Marks must be one capable of supporting the\nCourt’s judgment in that case. See Marks, 430 U.S. at 193 (“[T]he holding of the Court may be\nviewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest\ngrounds.”) (emphasis added) (citation and internal punctuation omitted); see also Triplett Grille, 40\nF.3d at 133-34 (noting that the articulated standard must “necessarily produce results with which a\nmajority of the Court from that case would agree”). Therefore, we reject the Eleventh Circuit’s\nsuggestion in Johnson v. Board of Regents of the University of Georgia, 263 F.3d 1234, 1247 (11th\nCir. 2001), that “the narrowest - i.e, less far-reaching - common ground of the Brennan and Powell\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 10\n\n\n129, 134 (6th Cir. 1994) (“While there is some awkwardness in attributing precedential value to an\nopinion of one Supreme Court justice to which no justice adhered, it is the usual practice when that\nis the determinative opinion.”); Smith v. Univ. of Washington, 233 F.3d 1188, 1200 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\n\n        Because this court is bound by Justice Powell’s Bakke opinion, we find that the Law School\nhas a compelling state interest in achieving a diverse student body.\n\n                                                  2.\n\n        Our determination that Justice Powell’s diversity conclusion binds this court also finds some\nsupport in the Brennan concurrence’s qualified approval of the Harvard plan in the first footnote of\nits opinion: “We also agree with Mr. Justice POWELL that a plan like the ‘Harvard’ plan . . . is\nconstitutional under our approach, at least so long as the use of race to achieve an integrated student\nbody is necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 326 n.1\n(Brennan, J., concurring) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Under the Harvard plan, Harvard\nCollege justified its race-conscious admissions policy solely on the basis of its efforts to achieve a\ndiverse student body. See id. at 316. Harvard’s consideration of race could not be constitutional if\nit did not further a constitutionally permissible goal; therefore, by indicating that the Harvard plan\ncould be constitutional under its approach, the Brennan concurrence implicitly – but unequivocally\n\n\nopinions on the specific subject of student body diversity is that diversity is [only] an ‘important’\ninterest,” because application of an “important interest” rationale to Bakke’s facts would produce a\njudgment contrary to that actually reached by the Bakke Court. If student body diversity were only\nan “important” interest, Justice Powell could not join in the Court’s decision to permit “the\ncompetitive consideration of race and ethnicity” because a plan serving a merely important interest\nwould not survive strict scrutiny.\n         Moreover, under Marks, this court must follow the reasoning of the concurring opinion with\nthe narrowest line of reasoning on the issue of why the California Supreme Court could not\npermanently enjoin Davis from considering race, not – as the dissent suggests – the narrowest line\nof reasoning capable of being gleaned from a conglomeration of the opinions. DLS, Inc. v. City of\nChattanooga, 107 F.3d 403, 408-09 n.4 (6th Cir. 1997) ( noting that “with respect to a particular\nissue, [this court] must follow the reasoning of the concurring opinion with the narrowest line of\nreasoning on that issue”) (emphasis added). Because Justice Powell’s opinion provides the\nnarrowest support for Bakke’s judgment, we are bound by his reasoning in that opinion; we cannot\ncobble together a holding from various rationales in the discrete Bakke opinions. Id. (noting that “we\ndo not have the freedom to pick and choose which premises and conclusions we will follow”).\nAccordingly, we cannot accept the dissent’s invitation to extract two holdings from Bakke by\nmerging analogous portions of the opinions of Justice Powell and the Brennan concurrence. See\nDissenting Op. at 55-56 (Boggs, J.).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 11\n\n\n– signaled its agreement with Justice Powell’s conclusion that achieving a diverse student body is\na constitutionally permissible goal.7\n\n       Although there is no support – either within or without the footnote – for the contention that\nthe Brennan concurrence believed that the desirability of an “integrated student body” turns on\nwhether the consideration of race is necessary to achieve that integration, some courts have read the\nHarvard footnote’s qualifying language, “at least so long as the use of race to achieve an integrated\nstudent body is necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination,” to suggest that the\nBrennan concurrence implicitly rejected the goal of achieving student body diversity. See Hopwood\nv. Texas, 78 F.3d 932, 944 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n         It is a mistake, however, to read the qualifying language as a rejection of any rationale. “[A]t\nleast so long as” simply does not mean “only if.” Moreover, the qualifying language modifies when\nrace may be used: ‘at least so long as . . . necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination.’\nIt does not modify why.8 This Court cannot ignore the distinction between a constitutionally\npermissible goal – ‘achieving an integrated student body’ – and a constitutionally permissible use\nof race to achieve that goal – ‘so long as necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination.’\n\n\n\n        7\n         Unless one assumes that the Brennan concurrence would have approved the use of race to\nfurther an unconstitutional goal, the dissent’s aprioristic assertion that the Brennan concurrence\n“certainly did not endorse [Justice Powell’s diversity rationale]” flouts logic. See Dissenting Op.\nat 53 n.6 (Boggs, J.). The operative syllogism is uncomplicated: (1) Under no circumstances may\nrace be used to further unconstitutional goals. (2) The Brennan concurrence agrees, at least under\ncertain circumstances, that Harvard may use race to further its goal. Thus, the Brennan concurrence\nagrees that Harvard’s goal, ‘achieving an integrated student body,’ is constitutional.\n        In fact, just as the Supreme Court was bound by statements from discrete Bakke opinions\nindicating that Title VI’s coverage mirrors that of the Equal Protection Clause, see, e.g., Guardians\nAss’n v. Civil Service Comm. of New York City, 463 U.S. 582, 610, 612, 642, 103 S.Ct. 3221, 77\nL.Ed.2d 866 (1983) and Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517\n(2001), this court would be bound by five Bakke Justices’ agreement that Harvard’s diversity goal\nis constitutional, but for the – unclear – distinction between an “important interest” under\nintermediate scrutiny and a “compelling” interest” under strict scrutiny.\n        8\n          Hopwood’s reading is akin to construing the sentence “we agree that automobile drivers may\ndrive with their lights on, at least so long as the use of lights to see the road is necessitated by the\neffects of nightfall” to suggest seeing the road is a permissible goal only at night. Just as whether\nor not it is night does not qualify the permissibility of trying to see the road, whether or not the use\nof race is necessitated by past discrimination does not qualify the permissibility of seeking “an\nintegrated student body.”\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 12\n\n\nTherefore, we cannot read the Harvard footnote’s qualifying language to detract from the Brennan\nconcurrence’s agreement with Justice Powell’s diversity conclusion.\n\n                                                  3.\n\n        The Court’s subsequent characterization of Bakke further supports our determination that\nJustice Powell’s conclusion is binding. See Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 568,\n110 S.Ct. 2997, 111 L.Ed.2d 445 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227.\nIn Metro Broadcasting, Justice Brennan, speaking for the Court in an opinion joined by Justices\nWhite, Blackmun, Marshall, and Stevens, cited Bakke for the proposition that “‘a diverse student\nbody’ contributing to a ‘robust exchange of ideas’ is a ‘constitutionally permissible goal’ on which\nrace-conscious university admissions program may be predicated.” Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S.\nat 568 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-13 (Opinion of Powell, J.)). Metro Broadcasting’s insight\ninto Bakke’s holding is persuasive authority, which this court may not ignore. See Wright v. Morris,\n111 F.3d 414, 419 (6th Cir. 1997).\n\n                                                  4.\n\n         Relying on Adarand and City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493, 109 S.Ct.\n706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989), the district court found that “racial classifications are unconstitutional\nunless they are intended to remedy carefully documented effects of past discrimination” and\ntherefore concluded that the Law School’s interest in achieving a diverse student body “is not a\ncompelling state interest because it is not a remedy for past discrimination.” See Grutter, 137 F.\nSupp. 2d at 849. Because the Supreme Court alone retains the ability to overrule its decisions, we\nreject the district court’s conclusion.\n\n         In Bakke, the Supreme Court determined that Davis – an institution that did not purport to\njustify its race-conscious admissions program as necessary to remedy specific past discrimination\n– could consider its applicants’ race. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320. Thus, if the only constitutionally\npermissible reason to consider race is remedying specific past discrimination, Bakke’s judgment is\nno longer good law. In other words, adopting the district court’s conclusion that the Law School\ncould only justify race-conscious admissions decisions as a remedy for specific past discrimination\nwould necessitate a finding that the Supreme Court has implicitly overruled Bakke.\n\n        The Supreme Court, however, has explicitly prohibited just such a finding. See Agostini v.\nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S. Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997). Rather, “[i]f a precedent of\n[the] Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line\nof decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the\nSupreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.” Id. (quoting Rodriguez de Quijas\nv. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989)).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 13\n\n\n         Moreover, given that (1) Bakke’s judgment suggests that remedying specific past\ndiscrimination cannot be the only constitutional justification for a race-conscious admissions\nprogram, and (2) institutions of higher education have been relying on Bakke for more than twenty\nyears, see, e.g., Kenneth L. Karst & Harold W. Horowitz, The Bakke Opinions and Equal Protection\nDoctrine, 14 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 7, 7 (1979) (noting that Bakke provides a “how-to-do-it manual\nfor the admission of minority applicants to professional schools”), we are unwilling to infer an intent\nto overrule Bakke – implicitly or otherwise – into the Court’s Adarand decision. See, e.g., Planned\nParenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 855, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992) (noting that the\nCourt must consider “the cost of a rule’s repudiation as it would fall on those who have relied\nreasonably on the rule’s continued application” and suggesting that stare decisis precludes overruling\na decision that cannot be overruled “without serious inequity to those who have relied upon it or\nsignificant damage to the stability of the society governed by it”); see also Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U.S. 428, 443, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000).\n\n                                                   B.\n\n        Although he found that achieving a diverse student body was a compelling interest, Justice\nPowell declared Davis’s admissions system unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored.\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 319-20. Davis operated a dual-track admissions system featuring a separate\nadmissions committee and separate review process for minority applicants. Id. at 273-74. Davis also\nestablished a quota for minority students – for example, in 1974, Davis reserved sixteen spots for\nminority applicants. Id. at 275. According to Justice Powell, the critical defect in Davis’s program\nwas that non-minority students were “totally excluded from a specific percentage of seats in an\nentering class.” Id. at 319.\n\n        As an example of a constitutionally permissible admissions plan, Justice Powell advanced\nthe Harvard plan in which race or ethnicity was deemed a “plus,” but did not insulate a minority\napplicant from comparison with other applicants. Id. at 316. Under the Harvard plan, an institution\ncould consider the race and ethnicity of applicants, but race and ethnicity alone were not the\nexclusive components of academic diversity. Id. at 317. Thus, a black applicant could be “examined\nfor his potential contribution to diversity without the factor of race being decisive when compared,\nfor example, with . . . an Italian-American if the latter is thought to exhibit qualities more likely to\npromote beneficial educational pluralism.” Id. According to Justice Powell, such qualities included\n“exceptional personal talents, unique work or service experience, leadership potential, maturity,\ndemonstrated compassion, a history of overcoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the\npoor, or other qualifications deemed important.” Id. The Harvard plan was “flexible enough to\nconsider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant,\nand to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them\nthe same weight.” Id. Race could “tip the balance” in an applicant’s favor, but so could other factors\nlike “geographic origin or a life spent on a farm.” Id. at 316.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 14\n\n\n        Above all, the Harvard plan “treat[ed] each applicant as an individual in the admissions\nprocess.” Id. at 318. “The applicant who loses out on the last available seat to another candidate\nreceiving a ‘plus’ on the basis of ethnic background will not have been foreclosed from all\nconsideration for that seat simply because he was not the right color or had the wrong surname.” Id.\nRather, his denied admission “would mean only that his combined qualifications, which may have\nincluded similar nonobjective factors, did not outweigh those of the other applicant.” Id.\n\n        In endorsing the Harvard plan, Justice Powell accepted that a university could not provide\n“a truly heterogen[e]ous environment . . . without some attention to numbers.” Id. at 323. As the\nHarvard plan detailed:\n\n       10 or 20 black students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each other\n       the variety of points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United\n       States. Their small numbers might also create a sense of isolation among the black\n       students themselves and thus make it more difficult for them to develop and achieve\n       their potential. Consequently, when making its decisions, the Committee on\n       Admissions is aware that there is some relationship between numbers and achieving\n       the benefits to be derived from a diverse student body, and between numbers and\n       providing a reasonable environment for those students admitted. But that awareness\n       does not mean that the Committee sets a minimum number of blacks or of people\n       from west of the Mississippi who are to be admitted. It means only that in choosing\n       among thousands of applicants who are not only ‘admissible’ academically but have\n       other strong qualities, the Committee, with a number of criteria in mind, pays some\n       attention to distribution among many types and categories of students.\n\nId. at 323-24.\n\n        Justice Powell rejected Justice Brennan’s contention that the distinction between a quota and\na program that considered race and ethnicity as a potential “plus” was largely illusory. In Justice\nPowell’s view, a “plus” program – unlike a quota – lacked a “facial intent to discriminate.” Id. at\n318. Emphasizing that the fine distinction between a “plus” and quota system was both discernible\nand constitutionally significant, Justice Powell recalled Justice Frankfurter’s declaration that “‘[a]\nboundary line is none the worse for being narrow.’” Id. (quoting McLeod v. Dilworth, 322 U.S. 327,\n329, 64 S.Ct. 1023, 88 L.Ed. 1304 (1944)). Justice Powell added that “a court would not assume that\na university, professing to employ a facially nondiscriminatory admissions policy, would operate it\nas a cover for the functional equivalent of a quota system.” Id.; see also Johnson v. Transp. Agency,\n480 U.S. 616, 656, 107 S.Ct. 1442, 94 L.E.2d 615 (1987) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (approving\ngender-conscious promotion where defendant “tried to look at the whole picture, the combination\nof [her] qualifications and [plaintiff’s] qualifications, their test scores, their experience, their\nbackground, [and] affirmative action matters”).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 15\n\n\n       In summary, Justice Powell’s opinion sets forth two guidelines regarding race-conscious\nadmissions policies – (1) segregated, dual-track admissions systems utilizing quotas for under-\nrepresented minorities are unconstitutional; and (2) an admissions policy modeled on the Harvard\nplan, where race and ethnicity are considered a “plus,” does not offend the Equal Protection Clause.\nNeither party questions the applicability of Justice Powell’s opinion regarding the narrowly tailored\ncomponent of strict scrutiny, and it is our view that whether the Law School’s admissions policy\npasses constitutional muster turns on Justice Powell’s opinion.9\n\n                                                   1.\n\n        Drafted to comply with Bakke, the Law School’s consideration of race and ethnicity does not\nuse quotas and closely tracks the Harvard plan. Race and ethnicity, along with a range of other\nfactors, are potential “plus” factors in a particular applicant’s file, but they do not insulate an under-\nrepresented minority applicant from competition or act to foreclose competition from non-minority\napplicants. As part of its policy of evaluating each applicant individually, the Law School’s officials\nread each application and factor all of the accompanying information into their decision. The Law\nSchool, like Harvard, attends to the numbers and distribution of under-represented minority\napplicants in an effort to ensure all of its students obtain the benefits of an academically diverse\nstudent body.\n\n         The record demonstrates that the Law School does not employ a quota for under-represented\nminority students. The Law School’s witnesses, including the current and former admissions\ndirectors, all testified that the Law School does not reserve or set aside seats. For example, Dean\nLehman testified: “We do not have a portion of the class that is set aside for a critical mass of under-\nrepresented minority students.” Moreover, the Law School operates a single admissions system;\nthere is no separate track for minority applicants insulating them from comparison with non-minority\napplicants. Thus, the Law School’s admissions policy avoids the critical defect of the Davis\nadmissions program.\n\n       The Law School’s competitive consideration of the race and ethnicity of African-Americans,\nHispanics and Native Americans closely tracks the Harvard plan. In its admission policy, quoted in\nBakke, Harvard details that race is a “factor in some admissions decisions” and that “the race of an\napplicant may tip the balance in his favor just as geographic origin or a life spent on a farm may tip\n\n\n        9\n        We recognize that the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Justice Powell’s endorsement of the\nHarvard plan as dicta. See Johnson, 263 F.3d at 1261. Even if this portion of Justice Powell’s\nopinion could be labeled dicta, it is nevertheless dicta from the determinative opinion in the only\nSupreme Court case to address the consideration of race and ethnicity in academic admissions.\nAccordingly, Justice Powell’s endorsement of the Harvard plan carries considerable persuasive\nauthority and provides a more appropriate basis for our opinion than any test we might fashion.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 16\n\n\nthe balance in other candidates’ cases.” Id. at 316. Explaining the rationale behind this policy,\nHarvard highlighted that a “black student can usually bring something [to Harvard] that a white\nperson cannot offer.” Id. The Law School considers an applicant’s race and ethnicity as a potential\n“plus” factor, or as Professor Lempert testified, as one element among other elements. Because race\nand ethnicity are a “plus,” they undoubtedly “tip the balance” in some applicants’ favor. Importantly,\nhowever, the Law School’s consideration of race and ethnicity does not operate to insulate any\nprospective student from competition with any other applicants. The Law School’s explanation for\nits consideration of race and ethnicity also mirrors the Harvard plan. According to the Law School,\nstudents from these groups “are particularly likely to have experiences and perspectives of special\nimportance to [the Law School’s] mission.”\n\n         In seeking an academically diverse class, the record indicates that the Law School considers\nmore than an applicant’s race and ethnicity. In Bakke, Justice Powell stressed factors in addition to\nrace and ethnicity that could contribute to academic diversity. See id. at 317. He cited “exceptional\npersonal talents, unique work or service experience, leadership potential, maturity, demonstrated\ncompassion, a history of overcoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the poor, or other\nqualifications deemed important.” Id. Mirroring Justice Powell’s discussion, the Law School’s\nadmissions policy states that “[t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions” and that in\nevaluating “soft” variables, it considers a range of factors such as leadership, work experience,\nunique talents or interests and the enthusiasm of an applicant’s letters of recommendation.\nIllustrating this range, the policy provides that particular weight might be given to “an Olympic gold\nmedal, a Ph. D in physics, the attainment of age 50 in a class that otherwise lacked anyone over 30,\nor the experience of having been a Vietnamese boat person.”\n\n         The Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” of under-represented minority students also\ntracks the Harvard plan’s pursuit of a class with meaningful numbers of minority students.\nExplaining its attention to the numbers and distribution of minority students, Harvard emphasized\nthat “10 or 20 black students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each other the variety\nof points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United States.” Id. at 323.\nMoreover, “[t]heir small numbers might also create a sense of isolation among the black students\nthemselves and thus make it more difficult for them to develop and achieve their potential.” Id. In\ndefining the term “critical mass,” the Law School’s witnesses voiced virtually identical concerns.\nDirector Munzel testified that “critical mass” is a number sufficient so that under-represented\nminority students can contribute to classroom dialogue and not feel isolated. Dean Lehman similarly\nequated “critical mass” with sufficient numbers to ensure under-represented minority students do\nnot feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race, and feel comfortable discussing issues freely\nbased on their personal experiences. Professor Lempert and Kent Syverud, the current dean of\nVanderbilt Law School and a former Michigan Law School professor, offered similar explanations\nfor the Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” of under-represented minority students. Essentially,\nboth the Law School’s admission policy and the Harvard plan attend to the numbers of under-\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 17\n\n\nrepresented minority students to ensure that all students – minority and majority alike – will be able\nto enjoy the educational benefits of an academically diverse student body.\n\n        In light of the foregoing, we find that the Law School’s consideration of race and ethnicity\nis virtually indistinguishable from the Harvard plan Justice Powell approved in Bakke.\n\n                                                  2.\n\n        The unsuccessful applicants focus principally on the effects of the Law School’s policy,\ncontending first that the Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” is the functional equivalent of a\nquota because it has resulted in a range of under-represented minority enrollment from 10%-17%.\nAs a matter of definition, we are satisfied that the Law School’s “critical mass” is not the equivalent\nof a quota, because unlike Davis’s reservation of sixteen spots for minority candidates, the Law\nSchool has no fixed goal or target. That the Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” has resulted\nin an approximate range of under-represented minority enrollment does not transform “critical mass”\ninto a quota. Because Bakke allows institutions of higher education to pay some attention to the\nnumbers and distribution of under-represented minority students, see id. at 316-17, over time,\nreliance on Bakke will always produce some percentage range of minority enrollment. And that\nrange will always have a bottom, which, of course, can be labeled the “minimum.” These results are\nthe logical consequence of reliance on Bakke and establishment of an admissions policy, like the\nHarvard plan, that attends to the numbers and distribution of under-represented minority students.\nAs such, they cannot serve as the basis for a charge that the Law School’s admissions policy is\nunconstitutional.\n\n         In analyzing actual admissions data, the dissent tries out a variation of the unsuccessful\napplicants’ contention and focuses only on the years 1995 through 1998. Dissenting Op. at 75\n(Boggs, J.). Based on this grouping, the tightest four-year range available, the dissent concludes that\nthe Law School seeks a “critical mass” of forty-four to forty-seven under-represented minorities per\nclass, or “around 13.5%.” But as the dissent confesses in a footnote, the rest of the picture\n“deviate[s] a bit.” Id. at 75 n.29. From 1987 to 1994, under-represented minority enrollment was\n12.3%, 13.6%, 14.3%, 13.4%, 19.1%, 19.8%, 14.5%, 20.1%, respectively. More importantly for\npresent purposes, if we examine under-represented minority enrollment from 1993 until 1998, we\nsee that the Law School’s under-represented minority enrollment ranged from 13.5% to 20.1%. In\nlight of (1) the overwhelming testimony by Law School professors, admissions counselors and deans\nthat the Law School does not employ a quota or otherwise reserve seats for under-represented\nminority applicants and (2) Justice Powell’s instruction that lower courts presume that academic\ninstitutions act in good faith in operating their “plus” programs, we simply cannot conclude that the\nLaw School is using the “functional equivalent” of the Davis Medical School quota struck down in\nBakke.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 18\n\n\n        Relying on statistical evidence that under-represented minority students are admitted to the\nLaw School with comparatively lower undergraduate grade-point averages and standardized test\nscores, the unsuccessful applicants also argue that the Law School considers race and ethnicity too\nmuch.10 Although they concede that all admitted students are qualified, the unsuccessful applicants\ncontend that this disparity evidences an unconstitutional double standard for admission of under-\nrepresented minority applicants and non-minority applicants. Upon inspection, however, the\nunsuccessful applicants’ statistical evidence demonstrates just what one would expect a plan like the\nHarvard plan to demonstrate – that race and ethnicity, as “plus” factors, play an important role in\nsome admissions decisions. As the logical result of reliance on the Harvard plan, the unsuccessful\napplicants’ statistical evidence accordingly cannot sustain their contention that the Law School’s\nadmissions policy is unconstitutional.\n\n        In advancing the Harvard plan, Justice Powell, unfortunately, did not define or discuss a\npermissible “plus” with respect to the test scores and high school grades of under-represented\nminority Harvard applicants. And Harvard did not append a statistical comparison of minority and\nnon-minority standardized test scores and/or grades to its admissions plan. Perhaps Harvard, in\nenrolling meaningful numbers of under-represented minority students, could select under-represented\nminority applicants with test scores or high school grades equivalent to their non-minority\ncounterparts. And then again, perhaps Harvard grappled with some of the same admissions\nchallenges as the Law School does today. Of course, such admissions statistics are neither in the\nrecord before us nor explicitly incorporated into Justice Powell’s opinion. Under these\ncircumstances, we cannot hold that the Law School’s admissions program, which is virtually\nidentical to the Harvard plan, would nevertheless fail Justice Powell’s test for constitutionality.\nWithout some indication that Justice Powell specifically meant to limit the consideration of race or\nethnicity – as a “plus,” to “tip the balance,” or as a “factor in some admissions decisions” – to\ninstances where standardized test scores or high school grade-point averages were equivalent, we\ncannot adopt the limited definition of “plus” urged by the dissenting opinions. See Dissenting Op.\nat 71-73 (Boggs, J.); Dissenting Op. at 93 (Gilman, J.). And thus, we cannot conclude that the\ndifference, on average, between the standardized test scores and/or undergraduate grades of qualified\nunder-represented minority students and qualified non-minority students renders the Law School’s\nadmissions policy unconstitutional.\n\n                                                  3.\n\n        The district court relied on five factors in concluding that the Law School’s consideration of\nrace and ethnicity was not narrowly tailored: (1) the Law School did not define “critical mass” with\nsufficient clarity; (2) the apparent lack of a time limit on the Law School’s consideration of race and\n\n\n       10\n           The district court credited plaintiffs’ statistical conclusions, but did not incorporate them\ninto its discussion of whether the Law School’s admission policy was sufficiently narrowly tailored.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 19\n\n\nethnicity; (3) the admissions policy was “practically indistinguishable” from a quota system; (4) the\nLaw School did not have a logical basis for considering the race and ethnicity of African-Americans,\nNative Americans and Puerto Ricans; (5) the Law School did not “investigate alternative means for\nincreasing minority enrollment.” Grutter, 137 F. Supp. 2d at 850-52. As a initial matter, we have\nserious reservations regarding the district court’s consideration of five factors not found in Bakke,\nwhich, as we have stated, is the only Supreme Court case to directly address the consideration of race\nand ethnicity in academic admissions. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the remaining factors relied\non by the district court cannot sustain its holding.\n\n        Although not addressed in Bakke, subsequent Supreme Court opinions suggest consideration\nof race-neutral means is necessary to satisfy the narrowly tailored component of strict scrutiny. E.g.,\nCroson, 488 U.S. at 507 (“In determining whether race-conscious remedies are appropriate, we look\nto several factors, including the efficacy of alternative remedies.”) (quoting United States v.\nParadise, 480 U.S. 149, 171, 107 S.Ct. 1053, 94 L.Ed.2d 203 (1987)). Although the Law School’s\nconsideration of race and ethnicity differs from the racial classifications at issue in Croson, and the\ncontext of higher education differs materially from the government contracting context, see, e.g.,\nHopwood, 78 F.3d at 965 n.21 (Wiener, J., concurring) (“This unique context, first identified by\nJustice Powell, differs from the employment context, differs from the minority business set aside\ncontext, and differs from the re-districting context; it comprises only the public education context\nand implicates the uneasy marriage of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.”), we nevertheless\nassess whether the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives.\n\n         The district court acknowledged that the Law School introduced evidence indicating that\nunder-represented minority students could not be enrolled in significant numbers without explicit\nconsideration of race and ethnicity, but ruled that the Law School “fail[ed] to investigate alternative\nmeans for increasing minority enrollment.” 137 F. Supp. 2d at 852. Upon examination, however,\nthe record does indicate the Law School considered and ultimately rejected various race-neutral\nalternatives to the consideration of race and ethnicity. Director Munzel, former Director Shields and\nDean Lehman all testified that the Law School engaged in both pre- and post- admission recruiting\nactivities but that such activities were not enough to enroll a “critical mass” of under-represented\nminority students. Additionally, Professor Lempert testified regarding the lottery system, in which\nthe Law School would lower its admissions standards, establish a numerical cut-off for “qualified”\napplicants, and then select randomly from among those applicants. According to Professor Lempert,\nsuch a system would admit greater numbers of non-minority students, but would not yield\nmeaningful racial and ethnic diversity. Given the Law School’s consideration of race-neutral\nalternatives and the evidence that “under-represented minority students cannot be enrolled in\nsignificant numbers unless their race is explicitly considered in the admissions process,” we find that\nthe Law School has adequately considered race-neutral alternatives.\n\n       The dissent proposes the Law School pursue “experiential diversity in a race-neutral manner”\nand characterizes such an approach as a superior alternative to the Law School’s current admissions\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 20\n\n\nsystem. Dissenting Op. at 80-81 (Boggs, J.). In effect, then, the dissent proposes that the Law\nSchool only focus on its race-neutral bases of diversity admissions. But as the dissent essentially\nacknowledges, this proposed alternative could not possibly achieve the same robust academic\ndiversity currently sought and obtained by the Law School. The dissent says that it is “fully willing\nto stipulate that race does matter in American society, and that, on average, it matters more\nnegatively for some, if not all, of the groups favored by the Law School than it does for some, if not\nall disfavored by the Law School.” Id. at 82. As to the impact of income, the dissent also offers to\n“stipulate that such impact or disadvantage is not strictly limited by present income or status.” Id.\nYet the dissent nevertheless proposes that the Law School ignore the influence of race and ethnicity\nin pursuing a broad “pluralism of ideas and experiences” and, at the same time, reassures us that the\npursuit of race-neutral diversity will still somehow produce the broadest “pluralism of ideas and\nexperiences.” Id. at 81. In reality, by reducing the range of experiences the Law School can consider\n- namely, the experience of being an African-American, Hispanic or Native American in a society\nwhere race matters - the dissent proposes only a narrowed and inferior version of the academic\ndiversity currently sought by the Law School.\n\n         Lastly, we note that we do not read Bakke and the Supreme Court’s subsequent decisions to\nrequire the Law School to choose between meaningful racial and ethnic diversity and academic\nselectivity. An institution of higher education must consider race-neutral alternatives, but it need\nnot abandon its academic mission to achieve absolute racial and ethnic neutrality. Thus, in applying\nstrict scrutiny we cannot ignore the educational judgment and expertise of the Law School’s faculty\nand admissions personnel regarding the efficacy of race-neutral alternatives. We are ill-equipped\nto ascertain which race-neutral alternatives merit which degree of consideration or which alternatives\nwill allow an institution such as the Law School to assemble both a highly qualified and richly\ndiverse academic class. See Regents of the Univ. of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 226, 106 S.Ct.\n507, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985) (noting that a federal court is ill-suited “to evaluate the substance of the\nmultitude of academic decisions that are made daily by faculty members of public education\ninstitutions – decisions that require an expert evaluation of cumulative information and are not\nreadily adapted to the procedural tools of judicial or administrative decisionmaking.”) (citations and\ninternal punctuation omitted). Mindful of both our constitutional obligations and our practical\nlimitations, we also assume – along the lines suggested by Justice Powell – that the Law School acts\nin good faith in exercising its educational judgment and expertise. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 318-19.\n\n                                                  4.\n\n        We are not persuaded by the remaining factors that the district court relied on to invalidate\nthe Law School’s admissions policy. First, the district court’s conclusion that the term “critical\nmass” is not sufficiently defined is at odds with the extensive record in this case, and the district\ncourt’s own characterization of “critical mass” as the functional equivalent of a quota. See Grutter,\n137 F. Supp. 2d at 850. Numerous law school witnesses testified regarding the meaning of the term\n“critical mass.” For example, Dean Lehman equated “critical mass” with sufficient numbers such\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 21\n\n\nthat under-represented minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race, and\ndo not feel uncomfortable discussing issues freely based on their personal experiences. We also\nemphasize the considerable tension between the district court’s findings that “critical mass” is both\ninsufficiently defined and the functional equivalent of a quota. In any event, the district court’s\napparent insistence that “critical mass” correspond with a more definite percentage is also fatally at\nodds with Bakke’s prohibition of fixed quotas. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 319.\n\n        Second, the district court’s statement that “there is no logical basis for the law school to have\nchosen the particular groups which receive special attention under the admissions policy,” Grutter,\n137 F. Supp. 2d at 851-52, ignores both the Harvard plan and the Law School’s admissions policy.\nThe Harvard plan specifically identified “blacks and Chicanos and other minority students” among\nthe under-represented groups that Harvard sought to enroll through its admissions policy. Bakke,\n438 U.S. at 322. The Law School’s similar reference to African-Americans, Hispanics and Native\nAmericans accordingly cannot be faulted in this respect. Moreover, the policy itself supplies the\nlogical basis for considering the race and ethnicity of these groups – without such consideration, they\nwould probably not be represented in the Law School’s student body in “meaningful numbers.” As\nwith the formulation and consideration of race-neutral alternatives, some degree of deference must\nbe accorded to the educational judgment of the Law School in its determination of which groups to\ntarget. See Ewing, 474 U.S. at 226.\n\n         Finally, the district court’s determination that the Law School’s consideration of race and\nethnicity lacks a definite stopping point also does not render the admissions policy unconstitutional.\nSee Grutter, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 851. Although the district court correctly recited Adarand’s directive\nthat a race-conscious remedial program must be limited so that it “will not last longer than the\ndiscriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate,” this directive does not neatly transfer to an\ninstitution of higher education’s non-remedial consideration of race and ethnicity. Unlike a remedial\ninterest, an interest in academic diversity does not have a self-contained stopping point. Indeed, an\ninterest in academic diversity exists independently of a race-conscious admissions policy.\nNevertheless, even if we were to apply a durational constraint, we are satisfied that the Law School’s\nadmissions policy sets appropriate limits on the competitive consideration of race and ethnicity. The\nrecord indicates that the Law School intends to consider race and ethnicity to achieve a diverse and\nrobust student body only until it becomes possible to enroll a “critical mass” of under-represented\nminority students through race-neutral means. Thus, we are satisfied that the admissions policy is\n“sensit[ive] to the possibility that [it] might someday have satisfied its purpose.” See Associated Gen.\nContractors of Ohio, Inc. v. Drabik, 214 F.3d 730, 737 (6th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1089\n(2001).\n\n                                                  III.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v.

I write separately both to note my\ndisapproval of Judge Boggs’s decision to include a “Procedural Appendix” as part of his dissenting\nopinion and to provide an accurate account of how this case came to be argued before the present\nen banc court.\n\n                                                     I.\n\n        In publishing their “Procedural Appendix,” I believe that Judge Boggs and those joining his\nopinion have done a grave harm not only to themselves, but to this court and even to the Nation as\na whole. A court’s opinions state the reasons for its holdings and provide the public with the\nprincipled justifications for them. Dissenting opinions typically present principled disagreements\nwith the majority’s holding. Such disagreements over principle are perfectly legitimate and do not\nundermine public confidence in our ability as judges to do what we have sworn to do because, as a\nculture, we have long recognized that disagreements over principle are unavoidable. Given this\ncultural backdrop, disagreements over principle can be phrased in strong terms without damaging\nthe court’s ability to function as a decision-making institution in a democratic society. Judges\ncriticize their colleagues’ reasoning all the time, and, if they are to carry out their oaths of office, they\nmust do so. This robust exchange of ideas sharpens the focus and improves our analysis of the legal\nissues.\n\n       In the present case, Judge Boggs has written a lengthy and strongly worded critique of the\nsubstance of the majority’s holding in the present case. Although I disagree with his analysis and\nconclusions, I acknowledge his abilities as a jurist.\n\n         The final section of Judge Boggs’s dissent, labeled “Procedural Appendix,” however,\npublicizes disagreements over the internal workings of the court, which, as my colleague states, “do\nnot directly affect the legal principles discussed in this case.” Given that these procedural matters\nare, at best, peripheral to the matter at hand, the only reason that “it is important that they be placed\nin the record” is to declare publicly the dissent’s unfounded assertion that the majority’s decision\ntoday is the result of political maneuvering and manipulation. The baseless argument of the\n“Procedural Appendix” is that the decisions of this court are not grounded in principle and reasoned\nargument, but in power,1 and that the judges of this court manipulate and ignore the rules in order\n\n\n        1\n      Judge Boggs responds in his dissent that he does “not contend that the legal opinions of any\nmember of this court do not represent that judge’s principled judgment in this case.” Dissenting Op.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 24\n\n\nto advance political agendas. I am saddened that Judge Boggs and those joining his opinion believe\nthese things. But, more importantly, I am concerned that my dissenting colleagues’ actions will\nseverely undermine public confidence in this court. Cf. Memphis Planned Parenthood, Inc. v.\nSundquist, 184 F.3d 600, 608 (6th Cir. 1999) (Batchelder, J., separate statement on denial of\nrehearing en banc) (“Our dissenting colleague’s own purposes may be furthered by publicly\nimpugning the integrity of his colleagues. Collegiality, cooperation and the court’s decision-making\nprocess clearly are not. And public confidence in the judicial system and in this court clearly are\nnot.”).\n\n        Because we judges are unelected and serve during good behavior, our only source of\ndemocratic legitimacy is the perception that we engage in principled decision-making. See Planned\nParenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 865-66 (1992). This perception is based both in the reality of\nour practice — I believe that my colleagues, all of them, strive to decide cases in a principled manner\n— and in the presentation of our decisions to the public in written opinions.\n\n        The decisions of this court are not self-executing but instead must be carried into practice by\nother actors. They will do so only as long as they regard us as legitimate, as we possess neither the\npurse nor the sword, but only judgment. For this reason, we are often described as the weakest\nbranch, but a court without purse, sword, or legitimacy would be weaker still. This is not to argue\nthat protecting the relative strength of the judicial branch should be our primary concern. Indeed,\nwe have all sworn to uphold the Constitution, and the Nation needs a strong judiciary to check the\noccasional excesses of the other branches and, more importantly, to preserve the rule of law.\n\n       Our ability to perform these crucial tasks is imperiled when members of this court take it\nupon themselves to “expose to public view” disagreements over procedure. The damage done by\nsuch exposés is, at least in part, the responsibility of those who report them, despite the efforts of\nJudge Boggs and those joining his opinion to disclaim responsibility for their own conduct. It is\nunderstandable, however, that they do so, as their conduct in the present case is nothing short of\nshameful.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       With great reluctance, I find myself forced to respond to Judge Boggs’s inaccurate and\nmisleading account of the procedural facts underlying the present case.2 As discussed in Part I of\n\n\n\nat 89. He does contend, however, that the result in the present case represents unprincipled\nprocedural maneuvering by members of this court. It is this contention to which I object.\n       2\n       This response is truly a recourse of last resort, as several members of this court have\nendeavored to persuade Judge Boggs to withdraw the “Procedural Appendix.” He has steadfastly\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 25\n\n\nthis opinion, I firmly believe that matters of internal court procedure should not be exposed to public\nview. But when one is attacked in the way that the members of the majority have been attacked, it\nis necessary to present an accurate account of the events in question; to fail to do so would create the\nimpression that Judge Boggs’s assertions are, in fact, correct.\n\n        Judge Boggs and those joining his opinion have numerous complaints regarding the\nprocedures that were followed in the present case. In the end, however, their chief complaint is that\nthe present case has been decided by a nine-judge en banc court (“the particular decision-making\nbody that has . . . decided [the case]”) rather than an eleven-judge en banc court, and that the\nmembers of the hearing panel originally assigned this case (Chief Judge Martin, Judge Daughtrey,\nand myself) purposefully engineered this result. A number of Judge Boggs’s unfounded assertions\ninvolve the May 14, 2001 petition for initial en banc hearing filed by Barbara Grutter. Judge Boggs\nrepeatedly asserts that the “preselected” hearing panel withheld this petition from the other members\nof the court until after Judges Norris and Suhrheinrich took senior status, on July 1 and August 15,\n2001, respectively.\n\n        The Sixth Circuit’s private docket, however, indicates that the May 14 petition for hearing\nen banc was first referred to the hearing panel on August 23, 2001, and it was not received by the\npanel until several days thereafter.3 By August 23, both Judges Norris and Suhrheinrich had taken\nsenior status. Even if the hearing panel had taken immediate action to circulate the en banc petition\nto the whole court on that date, the case would have been heard by the same en banc court that in fact\nheard it on December 6, 2001. The record simply does not support any other conclusion on this\npoint. Similarly, the June 4, 2001 order holding the en banc petition in abeyance was also referred\nto the hearing panel in August 2001. Thus, Judge Boggs’s claim that the June 4 order was not\ncirculated to the en banc court, on June 4, is true, as far as it goes, but misleading, because that order\nwas not circulated to any judges at that time, including the hearing panel. This ministerial order was\nsigned by the clerk of the court and was not issued as a result of any action by the hearing panel.\n\n       In addition, Judge Boggs’s assertion that the hearing panel violated the rules or internal\noperating procedures of the Sixth Circuit in not circulating the en banc petition to the entire court\n\n\n\n\nrefused to do so. The three members of the hearing panel have also personally assured Judge Boggs\nthat we did not engage in the manipulation of which he has accused us, but he has refused to accept\nour assurances.\n        3\n        My own records indicate that I first saw the May 14, 2001 petition on September 26, 2001,\nat which time I consulted with the other members of the hearing panel about circulating the petition\nto the whole court.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 26\n\n\nafter August 23 but prior to October 15, 2001, is simply incorrect.4 On December 5, 2000, months\nbefore the filing of the petition in the present case, Chief Judge Martin instituted a policy regarding\nthe treatment of petitions for initial hearing en banc. This change in policy was spurred by the\nincreasing frequency of such petitions, especially in pro se appeals. In the letter detailing the policy,\nthe chief judge instructed that, when such a petition is filed, the clerk of the court should enter an\norder, such as that issued in the present case, holding the petition in abeyance until the completion\nof briefing, and then refer the petition to the hearing panel assigned the cases. This procedure was\nfollowed in the present case. In each case, the assigned hearing panel would then decide, as an initial\nmatter, whether to deny the petition and proceed with the scheduled panel consideration or, if the\npetition raised a legitimate ground for initial hearing en banc, to circulate the petition to the rest of\nthe court. To my knowledge, no one raised any objection to this policy when it was circulated to the\ncourt for comment and instituted in December 2000. Pursuant to this policy, the hearing panel in\nthe present case decided, in September 2001, not to circulate the en banc petition to the entire court.\nWhatever the prior practice of the Sixth Circuit with respect to the circulation of petitions for initial\nhearing en banc, see Dissenting Op. at 86 n.43 (discussing petitions filed in the year 2000), the\nhearing panel in the present case was not required to circulate the May 14 en banc petition under the\npolicy in effect in September 2001.\n\n        As Judge Boggs indicates in his dissent, an initial hearing of a case en banc is an extremely\nrare occurrence. See Dissenting Op. at 88 (“I have been on the court for [sixteen] years, and I do not\nrecall an initial hearing en banc in my tenure.”). Thus, the hearing panel’s decision not to circulate\nthe petition for an initial hearing en banc in the present case — prior to the events discussed infra\n— is perfectly understandable. Indeed, if the members of the hearing panel had circulated the May\n14 petition in September 2001, the other members of the court would have likely voted not to hear\nthe case initially en banc, since Judge Boggs cannot recall any other instance of such a petition\nhaving been granted in the past sixteen years. In light of this consideration, however, I do not see\nhow the hearing panel can be faulted for not circulating the petition.\n\n         Judge Boggs also objects to the treatment of the present case as a “must panel” case, the\ncomposition of the “preselected” hearing panel, and the handling of all actions and motions related\nto this appeal by the “preselected” hearing panel. These objections are relatively minor, given the\nsubsequent decision to hear the case initially en banc.5 Indeed, this court’s decision to hear the\npresent case en banc was motivated by the concerns related to the composition of the hearing panel.\n\n\n        4\n         Of course, given the composition of the court on August 23, 2001, it would not have made\nany difference to the outcome of the case whether the en banc petition had been circulated on that\ndate, or in September, or in early October 2001.\n        5\n       These objections are also minor in that Judge Boggs does not argue that any of the decisions\nwith which he finds fault actually changed the outcome of the present case.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 27\n\n\nThese concerns were raised by Senior Circuit Judge Ralph Guy in a letter to Chief Judge Martin,\nwhich was dated October 15, 2001. The poll letter, issued by the hearing panel to the en banc court\nthat very day, stated the following rationale for circulating the petition for hearing en banc:\n\n       Re: Petition for Initial Hearing En Banc; Request for a Poll\n\n               Plaintiffs Gratz and Grutter have filed a petition for initial hearing en banc in\n       these two cases concerning the admissions policies of the University of Michigan and\n       its law school. Pursuant to the usual court policy, this petition for initial hearing en\n       banc was referred to the panel hearing the case. The reasons stated for initial hearing\n       en banc were the “exceptional importance” of the case, the “inevitable conflict” with\n       another federal circuit’s opinion in view of the already conflicting decisions of the\n       Fifth Circuit in Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996), and 236 F.3d 256\n       (5th Cir. 2000), and the Ninth Circuit in Smith v. University of Washington Law Sch.,\n       233 F.3d 1188 (9th Cir. 2000), and the need for expedited resolution.\n\n                The panel that was assigned this case is Chief Judge Martin, Judge\n       Daughtrey, and Judge Moore. The panel believed that the usual court policy referring\n       a petition for initial hearing en banc should be followed, and that the reasons set forth\n       for initial hearing en banc did not warrant such an initial hearing. The panel already\n       had expedited the appeal process, the conflict between the circuits already existed,\n       and we had not heard en banc any number of other exceptionally important cases.\n\n               Because of a question that has been raised regarding the composition of the\n       panel, the panel believes that the en banc court should vote on the petition for initial\n       hearing en banc. Hence the petition is attached for a vote. Since the case is\n       scheduled to be heard by the panel on Wednesday, October 23, time is of the essence\n       in deciding whether to proceed initially en banc.\n\n               Judges Daughtrey and Moore were on the initial panel in 1999 considering\n       questions of intervention. Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394 (6th Cir. 1999). The\n       third judge was Judge Stafford, a Senior District Judge from the Northern District of\n       Florida. Pursuant to our “must panel” practice, Judges Daughtrey and Moore have\n       continued on this case. Chief Judge Martin was substituted for Judge Stafford.\n\n                The panel requests that the en banc court be polled regarding the petition for\n       initial hearing en banc.\n\nThe vote for hearing en banc was seven in favor — Chief Judge Martin, Judges Siler, Daughtrey,\nMoore, Cole, Clay, and Gilman — with no votes cast against hearing en banc. Neither Judge Boggs\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 28\n\n\nnor Judge Batchelder voted in this matter, but, pursuant to our rules, their non-votes were in effect\nvotes against the en banc hearing of the present case.\n\n         This court voted to hear the present case en banc in order to resolve the concerns of certain\nmembers of the court about the composition of the hearing panel. Judge Boggs and those joining\nhis opinion now complain about the composition of the en banc court. But, as I have demonstrated\nsupra, these complaints are without merit. Moreover, even if the “preselected” hearing panel had\nacted as Judge Boggs claims, which it did not, it is important to note that this did not deprive Judge\nBoggs and the other dissenters of the opportunity to call for initial hearing en banc on their own\ninitiative at any time.\n\n        The internal operating procedures of this court permit any active judge to request a poll for\nhearing a case initially en banc, regardless of whether a party has filed a petition for hearing en banc.\nSee 6 Cir. I.O.P. 35(c). If, then, Judges Boggs and others were concerned with the selection of the\nhearing panel in the present case at some point prior to October 15, 2001, there was an internal\nprocedure by which they could have addressed those concerns. As the present appeal was filed on\nApril 2, 2001, prompt action by Judges Boggs and the other dissenters would have resulted in an en\nbanc hearing before a different en banc court — or, in other words, Judge Boggs and the other\ndissenters could have called for an en banc hearing before the eleven-judge en banc court they now\nargue was deprived of this opportunity.\n\n        The simple fact of the matter is that the present case was treated as a “must panel” case as\nearly as July 2000. In Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394 (6th Cir. 1999), a panel consisting of Judge\nDaughtrey, myself, and Judge William H. Stafford, a senior district judge from the Northern District\nof Florida, reversed district court orders denying the motions of prospective intervenors to intervene\nin the present case and in its companion case, Gratz v. Bollinger. The opinion in the intervenors’\ncase was issued on August 10, 1999. Subsequent to that decision, the defendants requested\npermission to appeal the district courts’ certification of plaintiff classes in Grutter and Gratz,\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f). On July 10, 2000, the clerk of the court contacted\nJudge Daughtrey and me regarding whether those appeals (Sixth Circuit docket numbers 00-0107\nand 00-0109), which were consolidated for purposes of appeal, represented a “must panel” situation.\nWe decided that these cases did represent a “must panel” situation, where subsequent matters should\nbe returned to the original panel due to their interrelatedness with the original matter, and these cases\nwere transferred to a motions panel including Judge Daughtrey and myself.\n\n        At that time, Chief Judge Martin was substituted for Judge Stafford on the motions panel.\nSixth Circuit rules give the active members of a panel the option of recalling the district judge or\nsenior circuit judge from another circuit who sat on the panel previously or replacing that judge with\na third Sixth Circuit judge. See 6 Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(2). Although that rule states that the third Sixth\nCircuit judge should be drawn at random, Chief Judge Martin has frequently substituted himself in\na variety of matters, of varying degrees of importance, throughout his tenure as chief judge, in order\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 29\n\n\nto avoid inconveniencing other circuit judges. Thus, it was not unusual for him to place himself on\nthe panel in July 2000. To my knowledge, no one has objected before to Chief Judge Martin’s filling\nof vacancies in other cases, even though his practice of doing so is a matter of common knowledge\namong the judges of this court.\n\n        This motions panel denied the defendants’ request for permission to appeal the class\ncertification decisions on September 26, 2000. The same motions panel also granted the parties’\nrequest for permission to file interlocutory appeals in Gratz, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), on\nMarch 26, 2001 (Sixth Circuit docket numbers 01-0102 and 01-0104).\n\n         When the appeal in the present case was filed, the defendants moved this court to stay the\ndistrict court’s order enjoining the Law School from considering race as a factor in admissions. The\npanel of Chief Judge Martin, Judge Daughtrey, and myself granted this stay in a published order on\nApril 5, 2001 (Sixth Circuit docket number 01-1447). See Grutter v. Bollinger, 247 F.3d 631 (6th\nCir. 2001). On that same date, the chief judge ordered that the appeals in Grutter and Gratz be\nexpedited, setting August 1, 2001, as the deadline for the filing of briefs and appendices. Oral\nargument was set for the court’s October term.\n\n        Thus, it should have been clear to the other members of the court, as of the published order\nof April 5, 2001, if not sooner, that the present case was being treated as a “must panel” case and that\nthe hearing panel would consist of Chief Judge Martin, Judge Daughtrey, and myself. At any point\nthereafter, Judge Boggs or any other member of the en banc court — including Judges Norris and\nSuhrheinrich, before they took senior status — could have called for a poll to determine whether the\ncase should be heard initially en banc. If there were questions regarding the composition of the\nhearing panel, then Judge Boggs and those joining his dissent could have raised those questions\nthrough this means at any time.\n\n        Judge Boggs and those joining his dissent did not raise these concerns in this manner,\nhowever. In fact, the dissenters themselves did not raise any complaints with the composition of the\nen banc court when the en banc petition was circulated, when the case was argued before the en banc\ncourt, or even in the first circulated draft of Judge Boggs’s dissent. The lateness of their complaints\nsuggests that their primary complaint is with the outcome of the present case rather than with the\nprocedures that were followed in arriving at that outcome. But unhappiness over the outcome of the\ncase cannot justify the dissenters’ “Procedural Appendix.” Judge Boggs’s opinion marks a new low\npoint in the history of the Sixth Circuit. It will irreparably damage the already strained working\nrelationships among the judges of this court, and, as discussed in Part I supra, serve to undermine\npublic confidence in our ability to perform our important role in American democracy. And for what\nreason? What purpose does the “Procedural Appendix” serve? Its author does not defend its\ninclusion, except to suggest that by placing his version of events in the record, some “remediation”\nmay be “possible.” Dissenting Op. at 89 n.49. Whatever “remediation” Judge Boggs may envision\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 30\n\n\nis properly the subject of a court meeting, but not the basis for an unprecedented “Procedural\nAppendix.”\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v.

I concur in Chief Judge Martin’s majority opinion, finding\nit correct and insightful in all respects. I write separately, however, for the purpose of speaking to\nthe misrepresentations made by Judge Boggs in his dissenting opinion which unjustifiably distort\nand seek to cast doubt upon the majority opinion.1\n\n        A.      Justice Powell’s Opinion in Bakke remains “the Law of the Land”\n\n         The dissent’s many fallacies begin with its attempt to undermine the majority’s holding that\nJustice Powell’s opinion in Bakke is controlling. Indeed, now Supreme Court Justice Scalia once\ndescribed Justice Powell’s opinion as “the law of the land.” See Antonin Scalia, Commentary, The\nDisease as Cure: “In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race.”, 1979 WASH .\nU. L.Q. 147, 148 (1979) (speaking then as Professor Scalia on Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke).\nAnd significantly, since Bakke the Supreme Court has done nothing to render this description of\nJustice Powell’s opinion any different. See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997) (reaffirming\nthat “‘[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, . . . the Court of Appeals should\nfollow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own\ndecisions’”) (quoting Rodriquez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989));\nsee also Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790, 796 (1st Cir. 1998) (recognizing that absent a clear\nholding from the Supreme Court, the precedential value of Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke, that\ndiversity is a sufficiently compelling governmental interest to justify a race-based classification,\nshould not be disturbed, especially where various individual justices have “from time to time . . .\nwritten approvingly of ethnic diversity in comparable settings”); Mark R. Killenbeck, Pushing\nThings Up to Their First Principles: Reflections on the Values of Affirmative Action, 87 CAL. L.\nRev. 1299, 1352 (1999) (illustrating why Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke is controlling, and why\nany other conclusion elevates form over substance inasmuch as Justice Brennan’s opinion cannot\nbe distinguished from Justice Powell’s opinion on the basis of the level of scrutiny applied, or on any\nother basis) (citing Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 286 (1986) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (finding that “[a]lthough Justice Powell’s formulation may be viewed as more stringent\nthan that suggested by Justices Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, the disparities between\nthe two tests do not preclude a fair measure of consensus[,]” particularly where “the distinction\nbetween a ‘compelling’ and an ‘important’ governmental purpose may be a negligible one”); Bush\n\n\n        1\n         Hereinafter, reference to “the dissent” shall be in regard to Judge Boggs’ dissent, while any\nreference to Judge Gilman’s dissent shall be specifically addressed as such. Judge Batchelder’s\ndissent is not referenced in this opinion.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 32\n\n\nv. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 1010 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that “all equal protection\njurisprudence might be described as a form of rational basis scrutiny; we apply ‘strict scrutiny’ more\nto describe the likelihood of success than the character of the test to be applied”); United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 567 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (contending that “[t]hese tests are no more\nscientific than their names suggest, and a further element of randomness is added by the fact that it\nis largely up to us which test will be applied in each case”)). One should therefore not be taken in\nby the dissent’s many contortions to convolute and undermine the majority’s holding that diversity\nin a student body is a recognized compelling governmental interest pursuant to Justice Powell’s\ncontrolling opinion in Bakke.2\n\n        B.      The Evidence Supports Diversity as a Compelling Governmental Interest\n\n         Likewise, one should not be led astray by the dissent’s contention that, Justice Powell’s\nopinion aside, developing a diverse student body cannot serve as a compelling state interest. While\ncriticizing the majority and implying that it is simply huddling behind Justice Powell’s opinion, the\ndissent claims that “the majority has given us no argument as to why the engineering of a diverse\nstudent body should be a compelling state interest sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny.” In an apparent\nattempt to elevate itself over the majority opinion, the dissent goes on to claim that it, on the other\nhand, considers “the arguments on both sides of this question . . . and conclude[s] that constructing\na diverse educational environment is not a compelling state interest.” The dissent’s claim that it\nconsiders the arguments on both sides is suspect because conspicuously absent from its consideration\nof the benefits of a diverse student body is any meaningful recognition of the wealth of legal\nscholarship – including a study involving students at the University of Michigan – speaking of, as\nwell as documenting through empirical data, the positive impact of diversity in education, not just\nfor the student throughout the educational journey but for years after the educational process is\ncompleted. Although the dissent criticizes this study on various points, the fact remains that the\nstudy has been hailed on many fronts.\n\n        Specifically, the major study conducted by University of Michigan Professor of Psychology\nand Women’s Studies Patricia Gurin, encompassed a wide scale analysis of the effects of a diverse\nlearning environment, particularly that at the University of Michigan, on a student’s overall\ndevelopment, and included data from the Michigan Student Study, the study of Intergroup Relations,\nConflict, and Community Program at the University of Michigan, and the 4-year and 9-year data on\na large national sample of institutions and students from the Cooperative Institutional Research\nProgram. See Patricia Gurin, Reports submitted on behalf of the University of Michigan: The\nCompelling Need for Diversity in Higher Education, 5 MICH. J. RACE & LAW 363, 364 (1999); see\n\n\n        2\n         In this regard, Judge Gilman’s dissent which “assumes without deciding that educational\ndiversity as defined by Justice Powell in Bakke is a compelling governmental interest” is misguided\nas well.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 33\n\n\nalso Steven A. Holmes, A New Turn in Defense of Affirmative Action, N.Y. TIMES, May 11, 1999,\nat A1 (citing Professor Gurin’s report and concluding that “the marshaling of statistical evidence of\nthe benefits of racial diversity” distinguished the present case involving the University of Michigan\nfrom similar cases involving Universities in California and Texas inasmuch as these institutions\ndefended their affirmative action policies with only “anecdotal evidence”).\n\n       Professor Gurin’s studies, and resulting statistical data, led her to conclude as follows:\n\n               A racially and ethnically diverse university student body has far-ranging and\n       significant benefits for all students, non-minorities and minorities alike. Students\n       learn better in a diverse educational environment, and they are better prepared to\n       become active participants in our pluralistic, democratic society once they leave such\n       a setting. In fact, patterns of racial segregation and separation historically rooted in\n       our national life can be broken by diversity experiences in higher education. This\n       Report describes the strong evidence supporting these conclusions derived from three\n       parallel empirical analyses of university students, as well as from existing social\n       science theory and research.\n\n               Students come to universities at a critical stage of their development, a time\n       during which they define themselves in relation to others and experiment with\n       different social roles before making permanent commitments to occupations, social\n       groups, and intimate personal relationships. In addition, for many students college\n       is the first sustained exposure to an environment other than their communities.\n       Higher education is especially influential when its social milieu is different from the\n       community background from which the students come, and when it is diverse enough\n       and complex enough to encourage intellectual experimentation. . . .\n\n               Students learn more and think deeper, more complex ways in a diverse\n       educational environment. Extensive research in social psychology demonstrates that\n       active engagement in learning cannot be taken for granted. . . . Complex thinking\n       occurs when people encounter a novel situation for which, by definition, they have\n       no script, or when the environment demands more than their current scripts provide.\n       Racial diversity in a college or university student body provides the very features that\n       research has determined are central to producing the conscious mode of thought\n       educators demand from their students. This is particularly true at the University of\n       Michigan, because most of the University’s students come to Ann Arbor from\n       segregated backgrounds. For most students, then, Michigan’s social diversity is new\n       and unfamiliar, a source or multiple and different perspectives, and likely to produce\n       contradictory expectations. Social diversity is especially likely to increase effortful,\n       active thinking when institutions of higher education capitalize on these conditions\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 34\n\n\n       in the classroom and provide a climate in which students from diverse backgrounds\n       frequently interact with each other.\n\nGurin, supra at 364-65. Professor Gurin backed these conclusions with “one of the most broad and\nextensive series of empirical analyses conducted on college students in relation to diversity.” Id. at\n365. For example, Professor Gurin examined “multi-institutional national data, the results of an\nextensive survey of students at the University of Michigan, and data drawn from a specific classroom\nprogram at the University of Michigan.” Id. All of these studies clearly indicated that interaction\nwith peers from diverse racial backgrounds, both in the classroom and informally, positively led to\nwhat Professor Gurin referred to as “learning outcomes.” That is, “[s]tudents who experienced the\nmost racial and ethnic diversity in classroom settings and in informal interactions with peers showed\nthe greatest engagement in active thinking processes, growth in intellectual engagement and\nmotivation, and growth in intellectual and academic skills.” Id.\n\n        Professor Gurin’s study also indicated that the benefits of a racially diverse student body were\nseen in a second major area, that being preparing students for a meaningful role in a democratic\nsociety, or what Professor Gurin called positive “democracy outcomes.” Id. at 365-66. “Students\neducated in diverse settings are more motivated and better able to participate in an increasingly\nheterogeneous and complex democracy.” Id. at 366. The results of Professor Gurin’s empirical\nanalysis indicated that these diversity experiences during college “had impressive effects on the\nextent to which graduates in the national study were living racially and ethnically integrated lives\nin the post-college world. Students with the most diversity experiences during college had the most\ncross-racial interactions five years after leaving college.” Id. The analysis also indicated that “[t]he\nlong-term pattern of racial separation noted by many social scientists can be broken by diversity\nexperiences in higher education.” Id.\n\n       Counsel for Plaintiffs in these underlying actions have been critical of Professor Gurin’s\nstudy and conclusions, claiming that they do nothing to refute the contention that race plays a\npredominate role in the admissions process. As one legal commentator has replied to this criticism,\n\n       [t]he critical question is not, however, whether or not race, or any other arguably\n       ‘suspect’ group characteristic, plays a ‘predominate role’ in the admissions process.\n       It is, rather, whether there is a compelling educational justification for allowing that\n       characteristic to enter the decision-making mix, and it is in that specific context that\n       the Gurin study makes a contribution.\n\nKillenbeck, supra at 1328. Professor Gurin possibly best illustrated the significance of her findings\nas to whether seeking a diverse student body may be considered a compelling state interest when she\nconcluded that,\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 35\n\n\n       [i]n the face of this research evidence, one can only remain unconvinced about the\n       impact of diversity if one believes that students are “empty vessels” to be filled with\n       specific content knowledge. Much to our chagrin as educators, we are compelled to\n       understand that students’ hearts and minds may be impacted the most by what they\n       learn from their peers. This is precisely why the diversity of the student body is\n       essential to fulfilling higher education’s mission to enhance learning and encourage\n       democratic outcomes and values.\n\nGurin, supra at 422. In light of Gurin’s study and, perhaps more importantly, the data and empirical\nevidence backing her findings on the value of a diverse student body, those who like the dissent are\nskeptical of characterizing diversity as a compelling governmental interest because “diversity” is not\ndefined or because they believe it to be a nebulous concept based on anecdotal evidence, find\nthemselves standing on ill footings. See John Friedl, Making a Compelling Case for Diversity in\nCollege Admissions, 61 U. PITT. L. REV . 1, 29-32 (1999) (noting that “[t]o date, almost all of the\nevidence in support of diversity in higher education is anecdotal in nature[,]” while discussing the\nlack of concrete, empirical evidence substantiating the value of a diverse student body as a\ncompelling state interest); see also Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 797 (“[A]ny proponent of any notion of\ndiversity could recite a . . . litany of virtues. Hence, an inquiring court cannot content itself with\nabstractions.”).\n\n        Professor Gurin’s empirical evidence supports what Justice Powell found to be true in Bakke\nregarding diversity’s place as a compelling state interest. That is, regardless of whether one agrees\nthat Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke is controlling, the fact remains that Justice Powell recognized\nthat a diverse student body is a compelling interest because it promotes the atmosphere of higher\neducation to which our nation is committed inasmuch as it allows the students to train in an\nenvironment embodied with ideas and mores “as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.” See\nRegents of the Univ. of Calif. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 312-313 (1978) (Powell, J.) (citing Keyishian\nv. Bd. of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967)). And, along the lines of Professor Gurin’s study, it was\nexpressly noted by Justice Powell that it is the student learning from the other student that makes a\ndiverse student body a compelling need. See id. at 313 n.48. Specifically, Justice Powell noted and\nembraced the comments of the president of Princeton University as follows:\n\n       “[A] great deal of learning occurs informally. It occurs through interactions among\n       students of both sexes; of different races, religions, and backgrounds; who come from\n       cities and rural areas, from various states and countries; who have a wide variety of\n       interests, talents, and perspectives; and who are able, directly or indirectly, to learn\n       from their differences and to stimulate one another to reexamine even their most\n       deeply held assumptions about themselves and their world. As a wise graduate of\n       ours observed in commenting on this aspect of the educational process, ‘People do\n       not learn very much when they are surrounded only the by the likes of themselves.’\n                                                    ***\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 36\n\n\n        “In the nature of things, it is hard to know how, and when, and even if, this informal\n        ‘learning through diversity’ actually occurs. It does not occur for everyone. For\n        many, however, the unplanned, casual encounters with roommates, fellow sufferers\n        in an organic chemistry class, student workers in the library, teammates on a\n        basketball squad, or other participants in class affairs or student government can be\n        subtle and yet powerful sources of improved understanding and personal growth.”\n\nId. (quoting William Bowen, Admissions and the Relevance of Race, Princeton Alumni Weekly 7,\n9 (Sept. 26, 1977)). Justice Powell then expressly found that the benefits derived from a diverse\nstudent body apply with substantial force at the graduate level as well as the undergraduate level.\nSee id. Relying on Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950), he reiterated that the Court made a\nsimilar point with specific reference to legal education: “‘Few students and no one who has\npracticed law would choose to study in an academic vacuum, removed from the interplay of ideas\nand the exchange of views with which the law is concerned.’” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 313-14 (quoting\nSweatt, 339 U.S. at 634).\n\n         In addition to the proffered, and indeed statistically proven, benefits of a diverse student body\nin order to fulfill higher education’s mission to enhance learning and encourage democratic\noutcomes and values, other reasons for justifying state imposed diversity in the educational realm\nhave also been proposed. For example, supporters of diversity in the university setting have argued\nthat seeking a diverse student body is consistent with this country’s historical commitment to\nabsolute equality in education. See Association of American Universities, On the Importance of\nDiversity in University Admissions, N.Y. TIMES, April 24, 1997, at A17; see also Brown v. Bd. of\nEduc., 347 U.S. 483, 494-95 (1954) (rejecting the “separate but equal” doctrine of Plessy v.\nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), while recognizing and rejecting the past practices of making it\nillegal to educate African Americans, or educating them in inferior surroundings). The law school’s\nconcern with the impact of racial isolation and stigmatization when only a few “token” minorities\nare allowed to attend echos this point.\n\n        It has also been argued that designing a system that takes into account factors other than\ntraditional notions of merit is nothing new, inasmuch as the very reason affirmative action arose was\nbecause for years some groups – particularly white males – were provided an advantage over others.\nSee Killenbeck, supra at 1320. In fact, as indicated in a detailed study conducted by Professor Linda\nF. Wightman, who at the time of her research served as Vice President for Testing, Operations, and\nResearch, Law School Admission Council, Inc., on the realities of affirmative action – “perhaps the\nmost compelling finding to emerge is not the extent to which affirmative action has opened the doors\nof legal education to African Americans and other minorities. Instead, it is the extent to which white\nlaw school applicants routinely benefit from the exceptions to the merit principle.” See id. at 1321\n(citing Linda F. Wightman, The Threat to Diversity in Legal Education: An Empirical Analysis of\nthe Consequences of Abandoning Race as a Factor in Law School Admission Decisions, 72 N.Y.U.\nL. REV . 1, 16 tbl.2 (1997)). Killenbeck explains that “[d]ata in [table 2 of Wightman’s study]\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 37\n\n\nindicate that 14.9% of accepted white applicants would not have been predicted as suitable for\nacceptance based on the combination of their undergraduate grade point average and LSAT score.\nThat is, if the purportedly objective merit criteria embraced by opponents of affirmative action were\nin fact dispositive, nearly one in every six white applicants actually accepted were arguably not\n‘qualified’ in the traditional sense.” See id. at 1321 n.100. Accordingly, for these white applicants,\nsomething more than merit was considered in the admissions process, just as something more is\nconsidered in a program designed to promote diversity. See id.; see also Susan Sturm & Lani\nGuinier, The Future of Affirmative Action: Reclaiming the Innovative Ideal, 84 CALIF . L. REV . 953,\n968-80 (1996) (criticizing the use of standardized test scores as an indicator of candidates’ suitability\nfor admission).\n\n        In short, the legal scholarship has indicated that a diverse student body serves to promote our\nnation’s deep commitment to educational equality, provides significant benefits to all students –\nminorities and non-minorities alike, and does so using a system which is not foreign to the\nadmissions process, but which allows for the benefit of all and not just some. Thus, although the\nmajority does base its holding that diversity is a compelling governmental interest on Justice\nPowell’s opinion in Bakke, it is clear that contrary to the dissent’s criticism, this holding is not\nwithout foundation even when standing alone. On the other hand, the dissent’s conclusion that\ndiversity cannot serve as a compelling state interest for purposes of surviving constitutional muster\nunder the Equal Protection Clause, is supported by neither legal scholarship nor empirical evidence.\n\n         For example, the dissent questions why race is at all relevant to promoting a student body\nrich in diversity of experience. Statistics have shown, however, that using factors other than race\nsuch as socioeconomic status, failed to produce the highly qualified, ethnically diverse student body\nachieved when race was also factored into the admissions process. See Wightman, supra at 39-45.\nThe dissent’s position simply misses that point advanced by Defendants in this case at oral argument;\nthat is, that a comparably-situated white applicant is a “different person” from the black applicant.\nThis is obvious when one considers the dissent’s criticism that the University would give diversity\npreference to a “conventionally liberal” black student who is the child of “lawyer parents living in\nGrosse Pointe” (typically thought of as one of Michigan’s more affluent suburbs).3 Notwithstanding\nthe fact that the black applicant may be similarly situated financially to the affluent white candidates,\nthis black applicant may very well bring to the student body life experiences rich in the African-\nAmerican traditions emulating the struggle the black race has endured in order for the black applicant\neven to have the opportunities and privileges to learn. See A. LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, JR., SHADES\n\n\n        3\n        The dissent originally characterized the black student as being “conventionally liberal.”\nThen, in response to the criticism that this was in itself stereotypical, the dissent added the\nparenthetical “or conventionally conservative” to its opinion. This addition, however, does nothing\nto change the fact that the dissent is engaging in stereotyping by labeling any minority group as\n“conventionally” of certain views.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 38\n\n\nOF FREEDOM, 195-96, 203 (Oxford University Press 1996) (formulating ten precepts of American\nslavery jurisprudence, with the seventh precept being the historical denial of any education to blacks\nand making it a crime to teach those who were slaves how to read and write); see also Frederick\nDouglass, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July? (1852) (addressing Rochester Ladies’ Anti-\nSlavery Society, and noting that “[i]t is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered\nwith enactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to\nwrite”).\n\n        It is insulting to African Americans, or to any race or ethnicity that has known oppression and\ndiscrimination the likes of which slavery embodies, to think that a generation enjoying the end\nproduct of a life of affluence has forgotten or cannot relate the enormous personal sacrifice made by\ntheir family members and ancestors not all that long ago in order to make the end possible. Indeed,\nwe in this country are only a generation or so removed from the legally enforced segregation which\nwas used to discriminatorily deny African Americans and other minorities access to education, as\nwell as employment, housing, health care and even basic public facilities. In addition, it is naive to\nbelieve that because an African American lives in an affluent neighborhood, he or she has not known\nor been the victim of discrimination such that he or she cannot relate the same life experiences as\nthe impoverished black person. A well dressed black woman of wealthy means shopping at Neiman\nMarcus or in an affluent shopping center may very well be treated with the same suspect eye and\nbigotry as the poorly dressed black woman of limited means shopping at Target. See Elise\nO’Shaughnessy, Shopping While Black, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING, Nov. 2001, at 129 (recounting Oprah\nWinphrey’s experience of being turned away from an affluent store while she was shopping with a\nblack female companion, even though white customers were allowed admittance, allegedly on the\npremise that the store employees were of the belief that Oprah and her friend were the black\ntranssexuals who had previously tried to rob the store; also recounting the discrimination other\nsuccessful black females such as Congresswoman Maxine Waters have experienced while shopping).\n\n        Thus, the dissent’s arguments as to why diversity cannot serve as a compelling state interest\nconstitute nothing more than myopic, baseless conclusions that ignore the daily affairs and\ninteractions of society today which very well may be experienced by all. And the dissent’s offer to\n“stipulate” to the fact that race continues to play a negative role in the lives of minorities is nothing\nmore than a mere expression of words made in an attempt to minimize the force of the many benefits\nof diversity as illustrated above. Anyone who has read the entire dissent quickly realizes that the\ndissent’s offer to stipulate that “race does matter,” constitutes a thinly-veiled offer of dubious\nsincerity, to say the least.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 39\n\n\n          This is evident by the dissent’s contention that the arguments made in favor of diversity\nmerely address societal ills that should not be confused with individual rights.4 The “societal ills”\nas characterized by the dissent are in fact borne out of the denial of individual rights such that the\ntwo cannot be separated. Indeed, history tells us that the Equal Protection Clause was enacted in an\nattempt to cure the “societal ills” that had denied African Americans the individual rights to which\nthey were entitled, such as the right to an education. See ALBERT P. BLAUSTEIN & CLARENCE CLYDE\nFERGUSON, JR., DESEGREGATION AND THE LAW - THE MEANING AND EFFECT OF THE SCHOOL\nSEGREGATION CASES 59-67 (Rutgers University Press 1985) (1957). It has been recognized that “the\nevil to remedied by this clause” was the “gross injustice and hardship” faced by the “newly\nemancipated Negroes” as a class. See In re Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 81 (1873). And\nit has been further recognized that the justifications for the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification\n“retain their validity in modern times, for 114 years after the close of the War Between the States,\n. . . racial and other forms of discrimination still remain a fact of life, in the administration of justice\nas in our society as a whole.” See Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 264 (1986). Accordingly, for\nthe dissent to claim that “people like Barbara Grutter” are being denied equal treatment under the\nlaw school’s admission policy such that the Equal Protection Clause is being “ignored,” particularly\nwhile irreverently invoking the name of Abraham Lincoln, is completely unfounded. The law\nschool’s goal of creating a diverse student body, which has not existed previously and would not\notherwise exist without its admissions policy, rests in the very heart of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n        Moreover, contrary to the dissent’s assertion, there is nothing to indicate that the law school’s\nadmission’s policy has “taken” anything “from the Barbara Grutters of our society.” As one legal\nscholar has recently illustrated, the idea that an admissions policy which provides minority applicants\nwith an advantage does so at the expense of white applicants is simply a myth. See Goodwin Liu,\nThe Myth & Math of Affirmative Action, The Washington Post, April 14, 2002, at B01 (citing\nexcerpts from his article “The Causation Fallacy: Bakke and the Basic Arithmetic of Selective\nAdmissions” which is to be published in the upcoming edition of the Michigan Law Review). As\nLiu makes note,\n\n        [f]or many Americans, the success of Bakke’s lawsuit has long highlighted what is\n        unfair about affirmative action: Giving minority applicants a significant advantage\n\n\n        4\n         I bring to the fore the “societal ills” – as the dissent has couched it – of the past and present\nfaced by minorities to illustrate that, contrary to the dissent’s assertion, a minority member of\nwealthy means may bring to the educational environment the same “life experiences” that a minority\nmember of impoverished means may bring because the “societal ills” experienced by both transcend\neconomic status. Once again, the reader should not be led astray by the dissent’s attempt to ignore\nor reframe an issue. While it is true that the Supreme Court has found that a generalized claim of\npast discrimination cannot serve as the basis for a remedial plan, no such claim is being made in this\ncase.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 40\n\n\n       causes deserving white applicants to lose out. But to draw such an inference in\n       Bakke’s case – or in the case of the vast majority of rejected white applicants – is to\n       indulge in . . . “the causation fallacy.”\n\n       There’s no doubt, based on test scores and grades, that Bakke was a highly qualified\n       applicant. Justice Lewis Powell, who authored the decisive opinion in the case,\n       observed that Bakke’s Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores placed him\n       in the top tier of test-takers, whereas the average scores of the quota beneficiaries in\n       1974 placed them in the bottom third. Likewise, his science grade point average was\n       3.44 on a 4.0 scale, compared with at 2.42 average for the special admittees, and his\n       overall GPA was similarly superior. Given these numbers, the only reason for\n       Bakke’s rejection was the school’s need to make room for less qualified minority\n       applicants, right?\n\n       Wrong. Although Justice Powell pointed out that minority applicants were admitted\n       with grades and test scores much lower than Bakke’s, he did not discuss what I found\n       to be the most striking data that appeared in his opinion: Bakke’s grades and scores\n       were significantly higher than the average for the regular admittees. In other words,\n       his academic qualifications were better than those of the majority of applicants\n       admitted outside the racial quota. So why didn’t he earn one of the 84 regular\n       places?\n\n       It is clear that the medical school admitted students not only on the basis of grades\n       and test scores, but on other factors relevant to the study and practice of medicine,\n       such as compassion, communication skills and commitment to research. Justice\n       Powell’s opinion does not tell us exactly what qualities the regular admittees had that\n       Bakke lacked. But it notes that the head of the admissions committee, who\n       interviewed Bakke, found him “rather limited in approach” to medical problems and\n       thought he had “very definite opinions which were based more on his personal\n       viewpoints than upon a study of the total problem.”\n\n       Whatever Bakke’s weaknesses were, there were several reasons, apart from\n       affirmative action, that might have led the medical school to reject his application.\n       Grades and test scores do not tell us the whole story.\nId.\n\n        Liu went on to recognize that although affirmative action did lower Bakke’s chance of\nadmission to the medical school, what was significant and most telling is “by how much?” Id.\nSetting forth the statistical data Liu then observed:\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 41\n\n\n       One way to answer this question is to compare Bakke’s chance of admission had he\n       competed for all 100 seats in the class with his chance of admission competing for\n       the 84 seats outside of the racial quota. To simplify, let’s assume none of the special\n       applicants would have been admitted ahead of any regular candidate.\n\n       In 1974, Bakke was one of 3,109 regular applicants to the medical school. With the\n       racial quota, the average likelihood of admission for regular applicants was 2.7\n       percent (84 divided by 3,109). With no racial quota, the average likelihood of\n       admission would have been 3.2 percent (100 divided by 3,109). So the quota\n       increased the average likelihood of rejection from 96.8 percent to 97.3 percent.\n\n       To be sure, Bakke was not an average applicant. Only one-sixth of regular applicants\n       (roughly 520) received an interview. But even among these highly qualified\n       applicants, eliminating the racial quota would have increased the average rate of\n       admission from 16 percent (84 divided by 520) to only 19 percent (100 divided by\n       520). Certainly a few more regular applicants would have been admitted were it not\n       for affirmative action. But Bakke, upon receiving his rejection letter, had no reason\n       to believe he would have been among the lucky few.\n\n       In fact, Bakke applied in both 1973 and 1974 and, according to evidence in the\n       lawsuit, he did not even make the waiting list in either year.\n\n       The statistical pattern in Bakke’s case is not an anomaly. It occurs in any selection\n       process in which the applicants who do not benefit from affirmative action greatly\n       outnumber those who do.\n\n       Recent research confirms this point. Using 1989 data from a representative sample\n       of selective schools, former university presidents William Bowen and Derek Bok\n       showed in their 1998 book, “The Shape of the River,” that eliminating racial\n       preferences would have increased the likelihood of admission for white\n       undergraduate applicants from 25 percent to only 26.5 percent.\n\n       The Mellon Foundation, which sponsored the study, provided me with additional\n       data to calculate admission rates by SAT score. If the schools in the Bowen/Bok\n       sample had admitted applicants with similar SAT scores at the same rate regardless\n       of race, the chance of admission for white applicants would have increased by one\n       percentage point or less at scores 1300 and above, by three to four percentage points\n       at scores from 1150 to 1299, and by four to seven percentage points at scores below\n       1150.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 42\n\n\n       It is true that black applicants were admitted at much higher rates than white\n       applicants with similar grades and test scores. But that fact does not prove that\n       affirmative action imposes a substantial disadvantage on white applicants. The\n       extent of the disadvantage depends on the number of blacks and whites in the\n       applicant pool. Because the number of black applicants to selective institutions is\n       relatively small, admitting them a higher rates does not significantly lower the chance\n       of admission for the average individual in the relatively large sea of white applicants.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n       Liu provided further statistical data to back this conclusion as follows:\n\n       In the Bowen/Bok study, for example, 60 percent of black applicants scoring 1200-\n       1249 on the SAT were admitted, compared with 19 percent of whites. In the 1250-\n       1299 range, 74 percent of blacks were admitted, compared with 23 percent of whites.\n       These data indicate – more so than proponents of affirmative action typically\n       acknowledge – that racial preferences give minority applicants a substantial\n       advantage. But eliminating affirmative action would have increased the admission\n       rate for whites from 19 percent to only 21 percent in the 1200-1249 range, and from\n       23 percent to only 24 percent in the 1250-1299 range.\n\n       These figures show that rejected white applicants have every reason not to blame\n       their misfortune on affirmative action. In selective admissions, the competition is so\n       intense that even without affirmative action, the overwhelming majority of rejected\n       white applicants still wouldn’t get in.\n\nId. (emphasis added). And so, contrary to the dissent’s assertion, “the Barbara Grutters of our\nsociety” have no reason to claim that anything has been “taken” from them by virtue of the law\nschool’s admission policy. In purporting otherwise, the dissent is simply advancing “the causation\nfallacy” which Liu exposes for the myth that it is.\n\n        The dissent also contends that one cannot consider the remedial qualities of correcting past\n– or for that matter present – discrimination as a way of supporting the law school’s admissions\npolicy because past discrimination is not the basis upon which the school claims that its admissions\npolicy is operating. Once again, the dissent’s narrow-mindedness misses the point. While it is true\nthat the law school’s policy is based upon its desire to achieve a diverse student body, the very\nreason that the law school is in need of a program to create a diverse environment is because the\ndiscrimination faced by African Americans and other minorities throughout the educational process\nhas not produced a diverse student body in the normal course of things. Diversity in education, at\nits base, is the desegregation of a historically segregated population and, as the intervenors\nessentially argue, Bakke and Brown must therefore be read together so as to allow a school to\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 43\n\n\nconsider race or ethnicity in its admissions for many reasons, including to remedy past discrimination\nor present racial bias in the educational system. See Trevor W. Coleman, A well-deserved honor for\na lifelong legal barrier breaker, The Detroit Free Press, April 26, 2002, at 10A (chronicling the life\nof the Honorable William McClain, the University of Michigan’s oldest living African-American\nlaw graduate, and describing how, as the only black law student in his class at the University,\nMcClain was “fed humiliation nearly every day,” was forbidden from living in the law quad, and was\n“prevented from joining study groups which are essential to a legal education”).\n\n         In summary, the dissent’s attempt to cast the law school’s interest in achieving a diverse\nstudent body as anything but compelling simply cannot carry the day, and its claim that white\napplicants are being denied equal protection under the law as a result of the school’s attempt to\nachieve a diverse student body is fallacious. As next illustrated, the dissent’s arguments as to why\nthe school’s admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve this compelling interest are just\nas ill-conceived.\n\n       C.      The Law School’s Policy is Narrowly Tailored\n\n       The dissent quarters its argument as to why the law school’s admissions policy is not\nnarrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest of diversity. Each of the four subparts bear\narguments that are unfounded and inflammatory. For example, in first discussing what the dissent\ncharacterizes as the true magnitude of the law school’s policy, the dissent focuses on LSAT and\nUGPA data. It then advances the outrageous contention that the law school’s policy allows for a\nminority applicant to put forth less effort than the otherwise similarly situated white applicant, and\nthat somehow the minority will therefore use his race to compensate for his lack of effort. There is\nnothing whatsoever in the record to support the allegation that the law school’s admissions policy\nwould be manipulated in this fashion by people of color or ethnicity.\n\n        Similarly, the dissent’s assertion that the law schools treatment of numerical credentials\n(UGPA and LSAT scores) for purposes of admission is “shocking,” ignores the scholarly writings\nshowing no correlation between these numerical credentials and success in law school or bar passage\nrates. See Wightman, supra at 1-2 (explaining that while a “numbers only” policy resulted in a sharp\ndecline in the number of minority students who would have been admitted to law school, there were\nno significant differences in the graduation rates and bar passage rates between those minority\nstudents who would have been admitted and those who would not have been admitted, thus leading\nto the conclusion that a “numbers only” policy would deny a legal education to many minority\nstudents who were fully capable of the rigors of a legal education and of entering the legal\nprofession); Sturm & Guinier, supra at 968-80 (explaining standardized test scores’ lack of\npredictive value with respect to students’ future performance). The law school’s effort to insure that\nits admissions process is inclusionary and is not substantively unfair should be viewed as an effort\nto advance the cause of both educational excellence and diversity, not as a counterpoint to a “merit”\nplan as suggested by the dissent. The case has not been convincingly made that conventional\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 44\n\n\nadmissions plans which equate to higher socio-economic status persuasively correlate to\nconsideration of “merit.” See id. at 992-96.\n\n        The dissent barely conceals its disbelief in the truth of the law school’s assertion that its\nadmissions officer reads every applicant’s file and makes an individualized determination regarding\nthe applicant’s suitability for admission. Accepting the dissent’s argument requires, in part, rejecting\nthe law school’s description of the manner in which its admissions program is administered without\nany adequate justifiable basis for doing so. The dissent goes so far as to claim the above-referenced\ncriticisms of using standardized test scores such as the LSAT and numerical credentials as means\nto admission should be directed to the law school and not to the dissent inasmuch as the law school\nchooses to consider such credentials in its admission policy. However, the dissent’s claim in this\nregard misses the point, and is an example of the misrepresentations made by the dissent in an\napparent attempt to reframe the issues. Criticism of the use of numerical credentials such as LSAT\nscores is made in this opinion to support the law school’s use of other criteria in its admission policy\n– one of which is race or ethnicity. And, contrary to the dissent’s inflammatory assertion, the law\nschool relies upon many factors in addition to LSAT scores, UGPAs, and race in its admission\nprocess. Although this assertion undoubtedly bolsters the dissent’s position, it is unfounded and flies\nin the face of the record before us.\n\n         The dissent next calls into question the law school’s designation of a “critical mass” of\nminority students in its student body. Claiming that the term “critical mass” is simply a phrase used\nto disguise what is actually an impermissible quota system, the dissent relies heavily upon the fact\nthat the numbers of minorities admitted over the years has varied only sightly. There may be any\nnumber of likely benign explanations for the numerical configurations, including a consistency in\nthe quality of minority applications for a few successive years and/or the application of a uniformity\nof perspective in evaluating the applications resulting from having the same evaluators read all the\napplications for admissions. Even idiosyncratic explanations for a relatively narrow numerical range\nfor a number of years would be constitutionally acceptable in the absence of a quota or other\ninvidious motivation on the part of the law school. The point is that on the record of this case, there\nare at least as many reasons to presume that there is not a quota as there are to presume that there is\none, and the balance certainly tips in favor of the law school’s representation that it does not employ\na quota in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.5\n\n      Typically, the purpose of the narrow tailoring inquiry involves an evaluation of the fit\nbetween the compelling interest and the policy adopted to advance that interest. See Recent Cases,\n115 HARV . L. REV . 1239, 1244-45 (2002) (criticizing the Eleventh Circuit’s decision that found the\nUniversity of Georgia’s race-conscious admissions policy unconstitutional, while noting that the\n\n\n       5\n         Inasmuch as Judge Gilman appears to rest his dissent on his belief that the law school’s\npolicy results in an impermissible quota system, his conclusion is fallacious as well.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 45\n\n\ncourt’s opinion “reveals both overt and covert hostility toward affirmative action policies” and that\n“[b]y introducing its own substantive agenda under the guise of a narrow tailoring analysis, the court\nstrayed from the purpose of the narrow tailoring inquiry”). Here, the dissent claims that the link\nbetween the law school’s “critical mass” and the values of diversity is lacking. Oddly, the dissent\ncites the report from Professor Gurin, the same report that others have hailed as showing documented\nevidence for the benefits of a diverse student body, claiming that the results indicate just the opposite\nof how Professor Gurin reports them. This contention, regardless of its accuracy, appears to be in\ncriticism of the concept of diversity itself, and not of the process to achieve that end.\n\n         Next, the dissent criticizes the relationship between diversity and the means to promote this\ninterest as being dependent upon the psychological makeup of the people involved. The dissent\nrefers to historical black leaders such as Frederick Douglass and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., opining\nthat these men would have said their piece without regard to whether others thought them to be\n“representative.” Apparently, by using these black leaders to make its point, the dissent is claiming\nthat the process employed by the law school is not necessary because if an African American, or\nother minority group member, has the “psychological” make-up to be a leader, he will be so\nregardless of whether he is one among ten or one among one hundred. Such an allegation misses\nthe point of the many beneficial aspects of diversity in education to minorities and non-minorities\nalike, is an affront to the sacrifices and contributions made by these black leaders, and does nothing\nto show why the law school’s policy is not narrowly tailored. In fact, the dissent appears to be doing\nnothing more than “introducing its own substantive agenda under the guise of a narrow tailoring\nanalysis” in making its arguments here. See Recent Cases, supra at 1239.\n\n        Finally, the dissent claims that because race-neutral means are available to achieve academic\ndiversity, the law school’s program does not pass constitutional muster. In reaching this conclusion,\nthe dissent completely ignores the evidence provided by the law school and its efforts to formulate\na viable race-neutral policy. The dissent strongly suggests that it simply does not believe the law\nschool’s representation that it considered and rejected as unworkable or impractical other admissions\npolicies and procedures, either because the available alternatives would not result in the sort of\ncompetitive student body pursued by the law school overall, or because the number of qualified\nminority students attracted to the law school would be inadequate. The law school’s premise, which\nthe dissent fails to convincingly dispute, is that the number of minority law students admitted would\nbe inconsequential in the absence of the school’s current admissions program.\n\n         Indeed, one of the dissent’s proposals as a “race-neutral” means of admission, using a lottery\nfor all students above certain threshold figures for their GPA and LSAT, is in no way “race-neutral”\nas reflected in the record. For example, the record indicates (through the testimony of Jay Rosner,\nMartin Shapiro, and David White among others) that performance on tests such as the LSAT and the\nSAT correlates with an applicant’s race and gender. In other words, the record indicates that LSAT\nscores are neither race-neutral or gender-neutral criteria for admissions decisions. Consequently, the\ndissent’s proposal of using a lottery based upon scores resulting from these tests in order to achieve\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 46\n\n\na race-neutral means of admission is inherently flawed, and would in no way reflect race-neutral\nmerit. Instead, such a proposal would reflect a combination of subtle preferences based on race,\ngender, and even class, see Sturm & Guinier, supra at 992-96; see also supra text accompanying Part\nB, and are of limited utility for predicting meaningful success across racial lines.\n\n        At its core, in purporting to suggest race-neutral methodologies, the dissent simply engages\nin an impermissible exercise of substituting its judgment in this regard for that of the educators who\nare the custodians and guardians of the law school’s mission and academic standards. See Regents\nof the Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225 (1985); see generally Susan Stefan, Leaving Civil\nRights to the “Experts”: From Deference to Abdication Under the Professional Judgment Standard,\n102 YALE L.J. 639 (1992) (providing a summary of the general doctrine of the rule of deference and\nthe situations to which it has been applied). Indeed, on the record before us, any purportedly race-\nneutral policy could result in a de facto segregated law school, the deleterious results of which have\nlong been known by society and rejected by the Court. See, e.g., Sweatt, 339 U.S. at 634-36.\n\n       D.      Summary\n\n        Chief Judge Martin’s majority opinion reversing the district court and finding the law\nschool’s admissions policy constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment provides a clear understanding and resolution of the issues involved. The dissent’s\nattempt to turn the majority opinion on its head and to reframe the issues does nothing to advance\nthe jurisprudence on this very significant matter.\n\n       E.      Response to the Dissent’s “Procedural Appendix”\n\n        Although the dissent’s substantive attack, which is grounded in neither fact nor law, is\ndisturbing, the dissent’s procedural attack, as set forth in its “Procedural Appendix,” constitutes an\nembarrassing and incomprehensible attack on the integrity of the Chief Judge and this Court as a\nwhole. Apparently, the dissent’s strategy in this regard is that if its substantive basis for\ndisagreement with the majority opinion is not convincing, then questioning the procedural posture\nof this case will be enough to forever cast doubt upon the outcome reached here today. This\nunfortunate tactic has no place in scholarly jurisprudence and certainly does not deserve to be\ndignified with a response. However, because of the magnitude of the issues involved, and because\nof the baseless nature of the allegations, this procedural attack cannot go unanswered.\n\n        The dissent questions the appropriateness of hearing this case en banc, the course by which\nthis case came to be heard by the en banc court, and the composition of the en banc court itself. It\nshould be noted at the outset that throughout the pendency of this appeal, the dissent remained silent\non all of these questions until now, and its concerns should therefore be regarded as having been\nwaived or forfeited. It was not until the various opinions had been circulated throughout the Court\nand the votes cast by the panel members that the dissent revised its opinion by tacking on these\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 47\n\n\ncomplaints and allegations. And the dissent’s new-found allegations of impropriety as to the course\nthis matter followed in reaching the en banc court simply defy belief. It is ludicrous to think that\nwith our circuit operating with only one-half of the active judges’ positions filled, and with over\n4000 cases reaching our Court each year, the Chief Judge or any members of this Court would single\nout any one particular case and maneuver the system for a particular outcome. None of the decisions\nmade by the Chief Judge in regard to the scheduling of this case or in relation to administering the\nCourt’s docket, differ in any significant way from the decisions the Chief Judge and the Court’s staff\nroutinely and frequently make with respect to pending matters. Given the voluminous nature of the\nCourt’s docket and the shortage of judicial resources, the case management tasks performed by the\nChief Judge are both necessary and appropriate, and were not in any sense improperly performed in\nrelation to the instant case.\n\n        Again, it is unfortunate that the dissent has chosen to stoop to such desperate and unfounded\nallegations which serve no useful purpose. The dissent’s claim that it is “legitimizing” the Court by\nrevealing the procedural course of this matter is disingenuous, at best, when considering that the\ndissent (Judge Boggs) once scathingly attacked Judge Damon J. Keith for revealing the vote count\nin a case of major import wherein the denial for rehearing en banc was split seven-seven. See\nMemphis Planned Parenthood v. Sundquist, 184 F.3d 600, 605-07 (6th Cir. 1999) (published order)\n(Boggs, J.). Judge Keith wrote in Memphis that he revealed the seven-seven vote tally because it\nsupported his belief that the majority’s opinion was result driven, and to encourage the litigant to\npossibly seek further review. See id. at 601-02 (Keith, J.). Judge Keith emphasized that in making\nthe vote tally known, he had “not violated any rule of internal policy . . .; nor [had he] divulged any\ninternal confidential communications[,]” and found “reprehensible” the “practices of secrecy and\nconcealment advocated by Judge Boggs.” Id. at 605. In response, Judge Boggs noted “with regret,\n[Judge Keith’s alleged] breach of the long-standing custom of this court that actions by a member\nof the court with respect to petitions for rehearing of en banc matters are matters of internal court\nprocedure and are not made public by other judges.” Id. (Boggs, J.) (emphasis added). Judge Boggs\nwent so far as to question the accuracy of Judge Keith’s conveyance of the vote tally by writing that\n“our court, of course, makes no warranties as to the accuracy of the assertions made in statements\nby judges (including, of course, this one).” Id. at 605.\n\n        Despite his one-time “regret” for a fellow jurist’s decision to make the vote tally known in\nan en banc case, Judge Boggs now characterizes his flagrant disregard for the Court’s procedural\nmeasures with respect to this case as a form of “legitimacy.” Judge Boggs has revealed internal\nprocedural matters to the public, particularly when he speaks of Senior Judge Ralph Guy’s internal\ncommunication to Chief Judge Martin in footnote 46 of his dissent. Furthermore, the remaining\nmembers of this Court have no way of responding to any inaccuracies by Judge Boggs regarding\nJudge Guy’s communication – or Judge Boggs’ characterization thereof – without themselves\nresorting to discussing the Court’s internal communications. Like many of the assertions made in\nhis dissent as a whole, Judge Boggs’ renouncement of secrecy and claim that his procedural\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 48\n\n\nappendix “legitimizes” the Court, are hollow, particularly in light of his position in Memphis.\nIndeed, it was “secrecy” for which Judge Boggs so vehemently argued in Memphis.\n\n        If anything, the fact that this significant matter was heard initially by the en banc court is a\ncourse of action advocated by justices of the United States Supreme Court. For example, in her letter\nto the White Commission, and several times in addressing the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference,\nJustice O’Connor, circuit justice to the Ninth Circuit, has suggested that the courts of appeals sit en\nbanc in matters they think are likely to reach the Supreme Court. See Stephen L. Wasby, How do\nCourts of Appeals En Banc Decisions Fare in the U.S. Supreme Court?, JUDICATURE , Jan. -Feb.\n2002, at 184 & n.6. Likewise, Justice Kennedy, himself a former member of the Ninth Circuit,\nsuggested to the White Commission that “questions of exceptional importance” are not heard en\nbanc nearly often enough. See id. at 184 & n.7 (quoting Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, letter to\nJustice Bryon R. White, August 17, 1998).\n\n        Here, in this matter of exceptional importance which may likely reach the Supreme Court,\nwe as an en banc court have properly and carefully considered the issues involved. Chief Judge\nMartin’s thorough majority opinion in every regard reflects that careful consideration, such that the\noutcome reached today is one based upon nothing other than sound and scholarly deliberation.\nDespite its unfortunate and desperate attempts to portray the majority opinion as anything less, the\ndissent’s substantive and procedural attacks remain unpersuasive.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 49\n\n\n                                           _____________\n\n                                             DISSENT\n                                           _____________\n\n        BOGGS, Circuit Judge, dissenting. This case involves a straightforward instance of racial\ndiscrimination by a state institution. Other than in the highly charged context of discrimination in\neducational decisions in favor of “underrepresented minorities,” the constitutional justifications\noffered for this practice would not pass even the slightest scrutiny. See, e.g., Fullilove v. Klutznick,\n448 U.S. 448, 491 (1980) (Burger, concurring) (“Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria\nmust necessarily receive a most searching examination.”); Regents of the Univ. of Calif. v. Bakke,\n438 U.S. 265, 307 (1978) (Powell, concurring) (“Preferring members of any one group for no reason\nother than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake. This the Constitution forbids.”);\nLoving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11 (1967) (“[T]his Court has consistently repudiated distinctions\nbetween citizens solely because of their ancestry as being odious to a free people whose institutions\nare founded upon the doctrine of equality.” (internal quotations omitted)); McLaughlin v. Florida,\n379 U.S. 184, 196 (1964) (invalidating a Florida state law against interracial cohabitation as “an\nexercise of the state police power which trenches upon the constitutionally protected freedom from\ninvidious official discrimination based on race”). In our case, the intent of the framers of the policy,\nthe statistics as to its impact and effect, and the history of its inception all point unmistakably to a\ndenial of equal protection of the laws. I, therefore, dissent from our court’s decision today finding\nthis discrimination to be constitutional.\n\n         In tracing the intricacies of the argument presented by the court and by the Law School, we\nmust be aware that the definitions and precise connotations of words are of crucial importance. As\nI shall demonstrate, in many critical instances, key words are used in ways contrary to their normal\ngrammatical meaning, or with very specific qualifications attached sub silentio. In the words of\nGeorge Orwell, in his famous essay Politics and the English Language, “a mass of Latin words falls\nupon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outline and covering up all the details.” George Orwell,\nPolitics and the English Language, in 4 THE COLLECTED ESSAYS, JOURNALISM AND LETTERS OF\nGEORGE ORWELL : IN FRONT OF YOUR NOSE , 1945-1950 127 (Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus, eds.,\nHarcourt, Brace 1968).\n\n        A very revealing example of this is the use of the term “affirmative action” to refer to the\npolicies in question. See Majority Op. at 3 (discussing intervening student groups, including “United\nfor Equality and Affirmative Action, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action By Any Means\nNecessary, and Law Students for Affirmative Action”). Standing alone, the term “affirmative\naction” might mean anything from affirmative action to study harder to affirmative action to exclude\nminorities. However, as used in the context of our society’s struggle against racial discrimination,\nthe term first enters the public print and the national vocabulary in Executive Order 10925, issued\nby President John F. Kennedy on March 6, 1961 and subsequently incorporated into a wide variety\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 50\n\n\nof statutes and regulations. It ordered government contractors to “take affirmative action, to ensure\nthat applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to\ntheir race, creed, color, or national origin” Ibid. (emphasis added). It is thus clear that whatever else\nMichigan’s policy may be, it is not “affirmative action.”1\n\n        The Law School absolutely insists that it does not consider applicants “without regard to”\ntheir race. See, e.g., Admissions Policies, University of Michigan Law School, April 22, 1992, at\n12 (noting “a commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of\nstudents from groups which have been historically discriminated against . . . [and] who without this\ncommitment might not be represented in our student body in meaningful numbers”). Instead, as is\ndiscussed by the majority and will be discussed at length below, Michigan considers all applicants\nwith exquisite regard for their race and national origin. As I put it to the counsel for the Law School\nin oral argument, if Heman Sweatt, the plaintiff in the famous case of Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S.\n629 (1950), had been able to ask the Dean of the University of Texas Law School, “Dean, would you\nlet me in if I were white?,” the dean, if he were honest, would surely have said “Yes.” I then asked\ncounsel, “If Barbara Grutter walked in to whoever the current Dean of the Law School is and said,\n\n\n        1\n        I will occasionally use the phrases “race” and “racial” as a shorthand for the type of\npreference accorded by the Law School. In fact, the groups chosen for preference are a melange of\ngroupings that are socially defined:\n\n        by skin color (“black” or “African-American.” I note that the children of Boer or Berber\n        immigrants are not conventionally given the latter label, which would surely apply to them\n        as a linguistic matter.);\n\n        by national origin (as the Census Bureau carefully notes, “Hispanics” can be of any race.\n        Presumably, the children of the former Peruvian president, Alberto Fujimori, though\n        ethnographically purely Japanese, would be considered “Hispanic.”);\n\n        or by legal status (depending on whether Michigan limits “Native American” preference to\n        legally enrolled tribal members, as opposed to those with sufficient ancestry of “Indian”\n        status that would qualify a person with comparable black or Hispanic ancestry for those\n        designations).\n\n        Any shorthand use of those terms in this opinion should be understood to have all the\nrelevant qualifiers. For similar precision by other universities with racial and ethnic preferences,\nsee Brief of Amicus Curiae, Columbia Univ., Harvard Univ., Stanford Univ., and the Univ. of Penn.,\nin Regents of the Univ. of California v. Bakke, 99 LANDMA RK BRIEFS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES : CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 1977 TERM SUPP . 689, 698 n.3\n(Phillip B. Kurland & Gerhard Casper, eds., 1978).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 51\n\n\n‘Dean, would you let me in if I were black?’ wouldn’t he have to honestly say either ‘Yes’ or ‘pretty\ndarn almost certain[ly]’?” Counsel agreed, but responded that “a black woman who had otherwise\nan application that looked like Barbara Grutter, that would be a different person.” Tr. at 38 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n       That answer puts starkly the policy of discrimination practiced throughout the ages.\n\n        Throughout this discussion, my quarrel is with the constitutionality of the policy, not its\nproponents. In a related context, Robert’s Rules of Order gives a good rule for public disputation:\nthose engaged in a debate “can condemn the nature or likely consequences of the proposed measure\nin strong terms, but . . . under no circumstances . . . attack or question the motives of another.”\nGeneral Henry M. Robert, ROBERT ’S RULES OF ORDER 380 (10th ed. 2000). I have no doubt that\nthe proponents of this discriminatory policy act with the most tender of motives. However, the noble\nmotives of those propounding unconstitutional policies should not save those policies, just as some\nsegregationists’ genuine belief that segregated education provided better education for both races was\ninadequate to justify those policies.\n\n         Finally, I do not doubt that there are strong policy arguments for what Michigan has done.\nThere is a plausible (though perhaps not a sound) policy argument that government should arrange\nsocial outcomes proportionally according to the race or ethnicity of its citizens, remedying, where\nit can, any pervasively unequal distribution of wealth, education, or status. There are many countries\n– India, Malaysia, and Serbia, to name a few – where such a policy is practiced. For more on\n“affirmative action” worldwide, see Thomas Sowell, RACE AND CULTURE : A WORLD VIEW 126-29\n(Basic 1994). However, so long as the Equal Protection Clause is a part of the United States\nConstitution, the United States is not one of those countries. The fact that some might think this\nsociety would be a better one if more governmental benefits were allocated, because of their racial\nor ethnic status, to blacks, Hispanics, or Native Americans and less to whites, Asians, or Jews, or\nvice-versa, does not make those policies permissible under our Constitution.\n\n        Instead, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment decided that our government should\nabstain from social engineering through explicit racial classifications. Thus, we subject every state\nracial classification to “strict scrutiny,” requiring that the state show both that the classification\nfurthers a “compelling state interest” and that it is “narrowly tailored” to achieve that interest.\nAdarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 235 (1995). The Law School’s admissions scheme\nsimply cannot withstand the scrutiny that the Constitution demands.\n\n       My discussion of the reasons for that conclusion falls into two parts below. First, I examine\nwhy the majority’s reading of Bakke is erroneous. Read correctly, Bakke remains good law, but does\nnot conclusively resolve the questions before this court. More recent decisions of the Supreme\nCourt, contrary to Grutter’s argument and what the district court in this case held, place these\nquestions in no greater relief.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 52\n\n\n        We are therefore faced with resolving for ourselves the constitutionality of the Law School’s\nadmissions scheme. Our inquiry must address at least one open question of law: can achieving\ndiversity be a compelling state interest? On this open question, I have no argument to which to\nrespond, as the majority never explains why “diversity” should be a compelling state interest, except\nto say that the conclusion is demanded by Bakke.2 After considering the arguments on both sides,\nI conclude that the state’s interest in a diverse student body, at least as articulated by the Law School,\ncannot constitute a compelling state interest sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny.\n\n        Second, much like Justice Powell’s in Bakke, my answer to whether the engineering of a\nracially diverse student body is a compelling state interest is not necessary to the resolution of the\ncase before this court. Even if student diversity were a compelling state interest, the Law School’s\nadmissions scheme could not be considered narrowly tailored to that interest. Even a cursory glance\nat the Law School’s admissions data reveals the staggering magnitude of the Law School’s racial\npreference. Its admissions officers have swapped tailor’s shears for a chainsaw.\n\nI. The State of the Current Law\n\nA. Bakke in a Nutshell\n\n        The Law School and the majority of this court argue that the constitutionality of the Law\nSchool’s policy is mandated by Supreme Court precedent, engaging in a painstaking analysis of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978),\nand the instructions given in Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), for attempting to discern\na “holding” from decisions in which the Court is splintered. I will engage in an equally detailed\ncounter-analysis; however, I begin with what is obvious from the face of the opinion.\n\n       In Bakke, the Supreme Court held that the particular type of massive racial discrimination\nengaged in by the University of California at Davis – setting aside a certain number of seats each\nyear and utilizing a separate admissions system for minority applicants – was illegal and that Allan\nBakke had a right not to be so discriminated against.3 (This fact is not revealed until page 12 of the\nmajority’s decision, and then only obliquely). However, five members of the Court agreed that a\n\n\n        2\n        The concurring opinion does present substantive arguments on this point, which are\nconsidered in Part II.A. Concurring Op. at 29-39 (Clay).\n        3\n         The judgment of the Court, affirming the judgment of the California Supreme Court and\nordering UC Davis to admit Bakke, was supported by the opinions of Justice Powell, Bakke, 438\nU.S. at 320, who would have held that UC Davis’s program violated the Fourteenth Amendment,\nand Justice Stevens, Id. at 421, who was joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart and\nRehnquist in his argument that the program violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 53\n\n\nblanket injunction that race could never be considered in admissions programs was at least\npremature, and one of those members went on to state that race could be used to promote diversity\nand proffered the race-conscious admissions program briefly described in an amicus brief by Harvard\nUniversity as a model of such a plan.4\n\n        Unfortunately, no policy other than the specific one utilized by UC Davis was before the\nCourt. Thus, no matter what analytical artillery is applied to deconstruct the various Bakke opinions,\nwe cannot come up with a “holding” that is any more specific than that UC Davis’s plan (and all\nplans that absolutely reserve a specific number of seats for the racially favored) was unconstitutional,\nand that some type of racial preference may be constitutional.\n\n       The majority in this case applies extremely subtle reasoning to come to the conclusion that\nBakke should instead be read to hold that the use of race, no matter how extensive, is constitutional\nso long as it does not specify a number of seats to be reserved for minorities and so long as it\narguably tracks the Harvard plan. The majority’s reasoning is problematic for several reasons.\n\n         Consider an exact analogy in the field of criminal law. Let us assume that state C has a\npolicy that its prison guards may beat prisoners to within “half an inch of their lives” for any\ndisciplinary infraction. When that policy is challenged in the Supreme Court, the Court’s holding\nis that the particular policy is unconstitutional, but that it will not issue an injunction against guards\never touching a prisoner for any infraction. Four members of the court believe that the policy is\nconstitutional in its entirety, and therefore dissent from the portion of the opinion holding C’s policy\nunconstitutional. Four other Justices argue that guards should never be allowed to punish prisoners\nphysically, and therefore dissent from the portion of the opinion refusing to issue an injunction\nagainst guards ever touching prisoners. A swing Justice strikes down the policy before him, but\nargues that at some time, in some manner, physical discipline might be appropriate. In particular,\nhe speaks favorably of the plan of a particular state (call it the “H” plan) where, under some\ncircumstances not specifically delineated, a guard could administer some unspecified amount of\nphysical chastisement.\n\n        Following this decision, another state, call it M, defends its policy on the grounds that it\nmerely authorizes guards to beat prisoners within “an inch of their lives” (as opposed to “half an\ninch”), and that it is specifically modeled after the H plan. Under the majority’s logic, any lower\ncourt confronted with this policy would be required to find it constitutional.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n        The description of the Harvard plan in this amicus brief was exceedingly short and\nundetailed, consisting of less than four pages. For the description, see LANDMA RK BRIEFS AND\nARGUMENTS, supra n.1, 735-38.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 54\n\n\n         It fails as a matter of simple logic to take a splintered result striking down one policy and\nessentially to glean from it a holding that any policy that falls short of the original policy is\nconstitutional. Indeed, the Supreme Court has very recently warned courts of appeals against similar\nthinking. In United States v. Knights, 122 S. Ct. 587 (2001), the Court rejected the Ninth Circuit’s\nreading of Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868 (1987), a case in which the Court approved a certain\nsearch-and-seizure policy for certain probationers. The Court noted that the court of appeals had\napparently read Griffin to stand for the proposition that “a warrantless search of a probationer\nsatisfies the Fourth Amendment only if it is just like the search at issue in Griffin.” See Knights, 122\nS. Ct. at 590. In rejecting the Ninth Circuit’s gloss on Griffin, the Court called it “dubious logic —\nthat an opinion upholding the constitutionality of a particular search implicitly holds unconstitutional\nany search that is not like it.” Ibid. (emphasis added). In effect, the majority of this court today\nsimilarly holds incorrectly that an opinion denying the legality of a particular policy implicitly holds\nconstitutional every policy that falls in the slightest degree short of the evils that were condemned\nin the first case.\n\n        The court does this by going past the general, and thus unhelpful, propositions actually agreed\nto by a majority of the Court in Bakke and adopting and even expanding as the holding of the case\nevery nuance of the opinion written by Justice Powell. In Part IV-D of his opinion, Justice Powell\nstated that race can be used as a factor in admissions decisions in order to further the objective of\ndiversity in an academic setting because the state has a compelling interest in achieving a diverse\nstudent body. No other Justice joined that Part. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-15. In Part V-A of his\nopinion, Justice Powell set out as a model of a constitutional plan a race-based admissions plan\nutilized by Harvard University, in which race was utilized as a “plus” factor that could “tip the\nbalance” in an applicant’s favor. No other Justice joined that Part. Id. at 315-20. The majority of\nthis court holds that these are the precedential holdings to be found in the case because, by reading\nBakke through the – in this case easily manipulated – lens of Marks, the court has determined that\na certain reading of the language of Justice Powell’s opinion represents the holding of the Bakke\nCourt.\n\nB. Bakke and Marks\n\n       1. Marks\n\n       Marks was an appeal from a conviction for transporting obscene materials in interstate\ncommerce. The defendant challenged the use of a jury instruction defining obscene material that\ncame from a Supreme Court case decided after the time of the defendant’s conduct, Miller v.\nCalifornia, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). The defendant alleged that the new definition expanded the scope\nof prohibited conduct, and therefore could not be applied in his case without violating his Due\nProcess rights. The Court therefore needed to determine what the operative definition of obscene\nmaterial was before Miller.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 55\n\n\n         The problem was that in the last obscenity case decided by the Court before Miller, Memoirs\nv. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 (1966), no opinion garnered a majority. In fact, the Court in\nMemoirs was deeply fragmented, and it was not facially clear that there was one definition for what\nconstituted obscene material that could be derived from the various opinions. Two Justices\nexpressed the view that all sexually explicit material was entitled to full First Amendment protection.\nId. at 421 (Black, dissenting). One Justice believed that only “hard core pornography” was\nunprotected. Id. at 425 (Stewart, dissenting). Three Justices joining a plurality opinion opined most\nimportantly that material must be “utterly without redeeming social value” before it will be stripped\nof First Amendment protection. Id. at 418. The remaining three Justices, writing in various dissents,\nwould have set the bar lower for defining material as obscene. Id. at 443 (Clark, dissenting), 454-56\n(Harlan, dissenting), 460-61 (White, dissenting).\n\n        The Court in Marks, viewing the divided landscape of Memoirs, stated famously that “[w]hen\na fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of\nfive Justices, ‘the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who\nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.’” Marks, 430 U.S. at 193 (quoting Gregg v.\nGeorgia, 428 U.S. 153, 169 n.15 (1976)). In Marks itself, it was clear that the Memoirs plurality\ndecision represented the narrowest grounds for the holding, as the plurality would have struck down\nthe fewest state and federal statutes defining materials as obscene.\n\n        Taken on its face, Marks might be read only for the limited proposition that a criminal\ndefendant cannot be held liable for conduct that he did not have fair notice would be prohibited. Id.\nat 192-93. However, Marks has been read much more broadly, to provide a basis for discerning the\nholding of the Court in circumstances where a majority of the Justices agree on an outcome but not\non a rationale for the outcome. See, e.g., O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U.S. 151, 160 (1997) (utilizing\nMarks analysis to discern a holding in Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349 (1977)); Coe v. Bell, 209\nF.3d 815, 818 (6th Cir. 2000) (using Marks to discern a holding from Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S.\n399 (1986)).\n\n       2. The Problematic Application of Marks to Bakke\n\n        In applying Marks to the various opinions in Bakke, the majority contends that Justice\nPowell’s opinion is necessarily the holding of the Court, because he concurred in the judgment of\nthe Court on the narrowest grounds. Powell, applying strict scrutiny, held that the UC Davis\naffirmative action program was unconstitutional, but also asserted that race could be taken into\naccount in admissions decisions in certain circumstances, namely to promote diversity. Bakke, 438\nU.S. at 314-15. Justice Stevens, in an opinion joined by three other Justices, did not reach the\nconstitutional issue but concurred in the judgment on the basis that race could never be used without\nviolating Title VI. Id. at 408-21. Justice Brennan, concurring in part and dissenting in part and\njoined by three other Justices, would have upheld UC Davis’s program, subjecting it only to\nintermediate scrutiny. Id. at 362. Justice Brennan wrote that race could be used in admissions\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 56\n\n\nprograms “to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice, at least when\nappropriate findings have been made by judicial, legislative, or administrative bodies with\ncompetence to act in this area.” Id. at 325. As such, Justice Brennan and the three Justices joining\nhis opinion concurred with Justice Powell’s judgment overturning the California Supreme Court’s\nruling that race could never be used in admissions programs, but would have found UC Davis’s\nprogram constitutional on the basis that it sought to remedy past discrimination and so dissented\nfrom Justice Powell’s holding on that score.\n\n        Since Justice Brennan would have applied intermediate scrutiny to “benign” racial\nclassifications, whereas Justice Powell would have applied strict scrutiny to all racial classifications,\nthe majority holds that Justice Powell’s diversity rationale in Bakke is binding precedent.\nSpecifically, they explain that “[b]ecause the set of constitutionally permissible racial classifications\nunder intermediate scrutiny, by definition, includes those classifications constitutionally permissible\nunder strict scrutiny, Justice Powell’s rationale would permit the most limited consideration of race;\ntherefore, it is Bakke’s narrowest rationale.” Majority Op. at 9. In other words, the majority sees\nJustice Powell’s reasoning as a subset of Justice Brennan’s, and therefore reasons it to be the binding\nholding of Bakke, as Marks instructs us to glean it. There are, however, two fundamental problems\nwith this argument.\n\n        First, the majority’s analysis inverts the concept of “narrowness” in Marks. In Marks, the\nMemoirs plurality opinion was “narrowest” because its interpretation of the First Amendment\ninvalidated a smaller set of laws. Marks, 430 U.S. at 193. In other words, the “narrower” opinion\nwas that which construed the constitutional provision in question less potently. In Bakke, Justice\nBrennan’s opinion, by adopting intermediate scrutiny, would invalidate fewer racial preference\npolicies than Justice Powell’s opinion which, through strict scrutiny, would invalidate more. Yet\nthe majority applies its own concept of narrowness, with no grounding in Marks, and holds that the\nopinion that creates the more powerful Fourteenth Amendment is indeed the narrower.\n\n        Second, the fact that Justice Powell’s reasoning on standards (that strict scrutiny should be\nused to evaluate the constitutionality of all racial preferences) is a subset of Justice Brennan’s\n(applying merely intermediate scrutiny) tells us nothing about the first question before this court\ntoday: whether diversity is a compelling state interest. At most, it might tell us that if the question\nbefore this court were whether to apply intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny to our analysis of the\nLaw School’s admissions program, the answer would be strict scrutiny. However, that question is\nnot before this court, because it has been conclusively answered, in favor of strict scrutiny. In\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 227, the Supreme Court held that all racial classifications are subject to strict\nscrutiny.\n\n       In trying to divine a holding from Bakke supporting the use of race for diversity purposes,\nwe are not able to apply Marks on a surface level, relying only on the fact that Justice Powell would\nhave applied a stricter standard of scrutiny to race-based classifications than would have Justice\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 57\n\n\nBrennan. The unavailability of a “surface-level” application of Marks may itself be dispositive.\nAfter all, Marks is merely a tool with which to determine the collective intent of a fractured court.\nBecause the first-level Marks analysis has been displaced by intervening precedent, perhaps the\napplication of Marks to the still-open questions raised by the Powell and Brennan opinions in Bakke\ncan no longer serve its intended purpose of deriving the collective intent of the Court, as the\nassumptions of the Justices deciding Bakke no longer hold.\n\n        The application of Marks to Bakke is also inapt because (1) the separate opinions in Bakke\ndo not constitute a coherent set and subset of each other and cannot be placed on a logical\ncontinuum; (2) the application of Marks really yields two Marks holdings from Bakke; and (3) the\nSupreme Court and other courts have recognized that Bakke does not yield a useful holding on the\nconstitutionally permissible use of race and that Marks ought not be applied in the circumstances that\nobtain here.\n\n        a. No Set and Subset or Continuum Available in Bakke\n\n        Nevertheless, if we are still to use the Marks apparatus, we need to examine the specific\nrationales offered by Justices Powell and Brennan to determine whether it is possible, in this court’s\nwords, to characterize one Justice’s rationale supporting the judgment as a “coherent subset of the\nprinciples articulated” by the other’s rationale. Triplett Grille v. City of Akron, 40 F.3d 129, 134 (6th\nCir. 1994).\n\n       There are potentially two judgments in Bakke. One struck down UC Davis’s admissions\nprogram. The second purported to overturn an injunction against all use of race, after discussing\npossible permissible bases for utilizing race in admissions decisions. With respect to the latter issue,\nthe majority in its Marks analysis defines the judgment as stating that race can be used in certain\ncircumstances by educational institutions.5 See Majority Op. at 6.\n\n       In order to view the rationale of Justice Powell’s concurrence as the narrowest grounds in\nsupport of this judgment, the court must read Justice Powell as embracing the use of race only for\n\n\n        5\n        The majority quotes from Section V-C of Justice Powell’s opinion, which was joined by the\nBrennan group and which states:\n       In enjoining petitioner from ever considering the race of any applicant, however, the\n       courts below failed to recognize that the State has a substantial interest that\n       legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the\n       competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin. For this reason, so much of the\n       California court's judgment as enjoins petitioner from any consideration of the race\n       of any applicant must be reversed.\n438 U.S. at 320 (emphasis added).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 58\n\n\nthe limited purpose of promoting diversity, while Justice Brennan would have permitted the use of\nrace more broadly, to promote diversity and to remedy past discrimination. On its face, Justice\nBrennan’s writing in Bakke does not support the use of race for both diversity and remedial purposes.\nNowhere in Justice Brennan’s opinion does he mention the diversity rationale, and he explicitly did\nnot join Part IV-D of Justice Powell’s opinion, discussing the diversity rationale. Further, as\nmentioned above, Justice Brennan clearly states that “the central meaning of today’s opinions” is that\n“[g]overnment may take race into account when it acts not to demean or insult any racial group, but\nto remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 325\n(emphasis added). Finally, in his now-famous first footnote, Justice Brennan, writing for himself\nand the three other Justices who joined his opinion, agrees that a plan like the Harvard plan set out\nas a model by Justice Powell would be “constitutional under our approach, at least so long as the use\nof race to achieve an integrated student body is necessitated by the lingering effects of past\ndiscrimination.” Id. at 326 n.1 (emphasis added).6\n\n        If one reads Justice Brennan’s opinion as approving the use of race for remedial purposes,\nbut not for diversity, one could make the argument that Justice Powell’s opinion, which accepts the\ngeneral concept of a diversity rationale, is broader than Justice Brennan’s, which accepts only a more\nspecific “past discrimination” rationale. Indeed, in a world permitting the use of race in admissions\ndecisions when it is used to promote diversity, educational institutions would merely have to place\na label on their actions in order to pass constitutional muster. There is no facial limit on the use or\n\n\n        6\n          A normal reading of this sentence would be that if the policy in question were necessitated\nby the lingering effects of past discrimination, the Brennan group would hold it constitutional.\nTherefore, if the policy were not so necessitated, one might argue by expressio unius that the\nBrennan group would hold it unconstitutional; at most one might argue that they would be wholly\nagnostic on the constitutionality of such a policy. However, the majority’s grammatical\ndeconstruction, arguing that the footnote somehow provides affirmative support for the proposition\nthat diversity is a compelling state interest, simply does not bear examination. Majority Op. at 10.\nIt is quite correct, as the majority points out, that “at least so long as” does not mean “only if.” Ibid.\nHowever, it does mean “if,” which is all that is necessary to show that the Brennan concurrence –\nwhile not affirmatively rejecting the Powell diversity rationale – certainly did not endorse it.\n         Further, the majority’s attempt to distinguish between the language modifying when race may\nbe used and why it may be used adds nothing, because a temporal qualifier at least hints at some\nreasoning related to that limitation. If I am told I can only buy beer between the hours of nine and\nfive, it may be because those are the hours when liquor stores are open, or it may be because of state\nlegislation limiting beer sales, or it may be because liquor store owners fear shoplifting at other\nhours; however, each of these rationales is related in a causal way to the time limitation. In just the\nsame way, it may be that Justice Brennan really meant only that race could be used when\n“necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination,” but this is still a qualification on the\nscope of Justice Powell’s diversity rationale.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 59\n\n\nthe ends of a race-based admissions policy seeking “diversity.” The remedial rationale, on the other\nhand, would at least require some proof of past discrimination, and it would provide an obvious\nendpoint for the program, namely when that past discrimination has been remedied.\n\n        At the very least, however, since Justice Powell rejected the past discrimination rationale and\nJustice Brennan can be read to have implicitly rejected the diversity rationale, there is no continuum\nto be found in Bakke; instead of a broader holding and a narrower holding, what we might have are\ntwo different and non-comparable holdings. If such a reading is adopted, the “holding” that the\nmajority of this court has divined from the Supreme Court’s Bakke decision is a rationale set out by\none Justice and rejected by eight. See Cass R. Sunstein, Public Deliberation, Affirmative Action, and\nthe Supreme Court, 84 Calif. L. Rev. 1179, 1185 (1996) (noting that the “rule” in Bakke represented\nthe thought of just one Justice, while “[t]he other eight participating justices explicitly rejected that\nrule”). This hardly can be consistent with the letter or the spirit of Marks.7\n\n         Viewing the rationales for the use of race put forth by the Bakke concurrences not as a\ncontinuum (or a set and subset), but as several distinct and unrelated justifications, is one of the ways\none might argue that Marks simply does not apply to Bakke. Indeed, this is precisely what the\ndistrict court held in the present case. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 137 F. Supp. 2d 821, 847 (E.D.\nMich. 2001) (“The Marks framework cannot be applied to a case like Bakke, where the various\nJustices' reasons for concurring in the judgment are not merely different by degree, as they were in\nMemoirs, but are so fundamentally different as to not be comparable in terms of ‘narrowness.’”).\n\n\n        7\n          Indeed, it is the rule in several of our sister circuits that Marks is simply inapplicable unless\n“one opinion is a logical subset of other, broader opinions.” See King v. Palmer, 950 F.2d 771, 781\n(D.C. Cir. 1991) (en banc). See also, e.g., Anker Energy Corp. v. Consolidation Coal Co., 177 F.3d\n161, 170 (3rd Cir. 1999) (“the Marks rule is applicable only where one opinion can be meaningfully\nregarded as narrower than another and can represent a common denominator of the Court's\nreasoning.”); Homeward Bound, Inc. v. Hissom Memorial Center, 963 F.2d 1352, 1359 (10th Cir.\n1992) (quoting approvingly of the reasoning in King). Cf. Dague v. Burlington, 935 F.2d 1343, 1360\n(2d Cir. 1991) (noting “the anomaly of the views of one justice, with whom no one concurs, being\nthe law of the land, where the Court is so divided on an issue and where there is no majority opinion\nat all”). The District of Columbia Circuit explained well the reason for such a rule:\n         When, however, one opinion supporting the judgment does not fit entirely within a\n         broader circle drawn by the others, Marks is problematic. If applied in situations\n         where the various opinions supporting the judgment are mutually exclusive, Marks\n         will turn a single opinion that lacks majority support into national law. When eight\n         of nine Justices do not subscribe to a given approach to a legal question, it surely\n         cannot be proper to endow that approach with controlling force, no matter how\n         persuasive it may be.\nKing, 950 F.2d at 782.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 60\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 61\n\n\n       b. The Potential for Two Marks Holdings\n\n        Even if one gets past the conceptual hurdle of treating as a continuum (or a set and subset)\ntwo rationales that are not clearly related in scope, it is not clear that a Marks analysis of the\nrationales in Bakke would produce the holding that the majority claims it does.\n\n        As mentioned, the majority defines the relevant judgment in Bakke abstractly, as holding that\nrace can sometimes be used by educational institutions. Until now, we have assumed that the\njudgment in Bakke is as the majority defines it. Rather than adopting a broad statement providing\nno real guidance on when race can be used and for what purposes, we might look at what the two\nopinions that concur on the possibility of a constitutional use of race have to say about each of the\ntwo potential rationales, namely remedying past discrimination and diversity. If we do this, we are\nessentially left with two holdings in Bakke on the permissible rationales for the use of race: one\nholding permitting the use of race for diversity purposes sometimes and one permitting it for\nremedial purposes sometimes.8 See generally Lackland H. Bloom, Jr., Hopwood, Bakke and the\nFuture of the Diversity Justification, 29 Tex. Tech. L. Rev. 1, 30-32 (1998).\n\n        Justice Powell’s decision would be the narrowest grounds to support the holding that race\ncan sometimes be used to remedy the effects of past discrimination. This is because the Brennan\ngroup would have allowed the use of race whenever there is a “sound basis for believing that the\nproblem of underrepresentation of minorities . . . [is] attributable to handicaps imposed on minority\napplicants by past and present racial discrimination.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 369. On the other hand,\nJustice Powell expressed a more limited view of the permissible use of race in this regard in Section\nIV-B of his opinion. He agreed that “[t]he State certainly has a legitimate and substantial interest\nin ameliorating, or eliminating where feasible, the disabling effects of identified discrimination.” Id.\nat 306. However, Justice Powell would not have permitted simple reliance on general past\n\n\n       8\n         The majority contends that by redefining the relevant judgment I impermissibly “cobble\ntogether a holding from various rationales in the discrete Bakke opinions.” See Majority Op. at 9 n.6.\nHowever, the majority misunderstands my aim. I am not suggesting we apply Marks to a given\njudgment and then pick and choose among the rationales to support that judgment. Instead, I am\nmerely suggesting an analytical tool whereby we more accurately define the relevant holding before\napplying Marks. By defining the holding as stating that race can be used to promote diversity\nsometimes, I illustrate that Justice Brennan’s rationale is the narrowest in support of that holding and\nin so doing call into question the premise that Marks provides an answer to the threshold question\nfacing this court.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 62\n\n\ndiscrimination, but instead would have required specific findings by a competent government body\nthat the use of race is “responsive to identified discrimination” before race could be used remedially\nin admissions decisions. Id. at 310.\n\n        However, with respect to the redefined holding discussing diversity, the one relevant in this\ncase, Justice Brennan’s opinion facially is the narrower. Justice Powell wrote broadly in his Section\nIV-D that “[t]he attainment of a diverse student body clearly is a constitutionally permissible goal\nfor an institution of higher education.” Id. at 312. Later, Powell wrote again that “the interest of\ndiversity is compelling in the context of a university's admissions program.” Id. at 314. Justice\nBrennan, on the other hand, specifically added a restriction to his expressed agreement. As discussed\nabove, Justice Brennan would be willing to support the diversity rationale embodied in the Harvard\ndiversity program set out by Justice Powell as a model, “at least so long as the use of race to achieve\nan integrated student body is necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination.” Bakke,\n438 U.S. at 326 n.1. Since it put a limit on the utility of diversity as a rationale supporting the\nconstitutionally permissible use of race in admissions programs where Justice Powell’s opinion\nexpressed no limit, Justice Brennan’s opinion is narrower than Justice Powell’s on the use of race\nto encourage diversity. So by merely redefining the relevant holding more accurately, I have reached\na result opposite that of the majority – Justice Brennan’s rationale becomes the narrower and\ntherefore becomes the Marks holding to be gleaned from Bakke on the diversity issue. This further\nshows the error in relying on Marks to answer the question before this court.\n\n        The above discussion is intended simply to illustrate that reasonable minds can and do differ\non the holding, if any, to be found in Bakke with respect to the diversity rationale. Those holding\ndifferent views on the subject could go back and forth endlessly, with no clear resolution. The\nreason for this – as almost all, wherever they stand on the argument, would agree – is that we are\ntrying to divine a clear holding from a decidedly unclear decision.\n\n        In this circumstance, the better view is that Marks simply fails to extract from Bakke a\nholding on the constitutionality of the diversity rationale. Indeed, the very fact that one must struggle\nto find a way to fit the Court’s Bakke writings into the Marks mold counsels against finding such a\nholding in Bakke.\n\n        c. Subsequent Treatment of Bakke and Marks\n\n       It is apparent that the Supreme Court has doubted that Bakke provided a holding beyond the\nobvious one that UC Davis’s system was illegal.9 Though only writing for four Justices, Justice\n\n\n        9\n         The majority finds support for its proposition that diversity is a compelling state interest in\nthe fact that Justice Brennan in Metro Broadcasting cited Bakke for the proposition that “‘a diverse\nstudent body’ contributing to a ‘robust exchange of ideas’ is a ‘constitutionally permissible goal’ on\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 63\n\n\nBrennan wrote in the introduction to his Bakke concurrence that “[t]he difficulty of the issue\npresented . . . and the mature consideration which each of our Brethren has brought to it have\nresulted in many opinions, no single one speaking for the Court.” 438 U.S. at 324. Two years later,\nin the course of examining a minority business provision in the Public Works Employment Act of\n1977, the Court expressly refused to adopt “the formulas of analysis” set out in Bakke and did not\ndiscuss any holding coming from the case, but instead set out to show that the challenged provision\n“would survive judicial review under either ‘test’ articulated in the several Bakke opinions.”\nFullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 492 (1980). After Marks was decided, the Supreme Court in\nAdarand again expressed doubt that there is a comprehensive holding to be found in Bakke. See\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 218 (noting that “Bakke did not produce an opinion for the Court”).\n\n       Further, there is Supreme Court precedent for the proposition that when it is so unclear what\nthe Marks holding would be in a fractured court decision, there may not be one. For example, in\nNichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738 (1994), the Court re-examined its prior, splintered decision\nin Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U.S. 222 (1980). After citing Marks and noting the varied possible\nholdings divined by different courts that had examined Baldasar, the Supreme Court declined to\nengage in a Marks analysis, stating:\n\n       We think it not useful to pursue the Marks inquiry to the utmost logical possibility\n       when it has so obviously baffled and divided the lower courts that have considered\n       it. This degree of confusion following a splintered decision such as Baldasar is itself\n       a reason for reexamining that decision.\n\nNichols, 511 U.S. at 745-46. See also Johnson v. Board of Regents, 263 F.3d 1234, 1248 n.12 (11th\nCir. 2001) (“The Supreme Court has not compelled us to find a ‘holding’ on each issue in each of\nits decisions. On the contrary, the Court has indicated that there may be situations where even the\nMarks inquiry does not yield any rule to be treated as binding in future cases.”). The fact that lower\ncourts are unclear as to what holding – if any – can be garnered from Bakke on the diversity issue\nis clearly illustrated by the University of Michigan cases, where one district court at least found\n\n\nwhich a race-conscious university admissions program may be predicated.” 497 U.S. 547, 568\n(1990) (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-13 (Powell, concurring)). Aside from the fact that Justice\nBrennan was applying intermediate scrutiny in Metro Broadcasting and therefore his views on the\nconstitutionality of any policy or rationale would not speak to the present case where strict scrutiny\nis the standard, the statement is – as the majority itself notes – merely dicta. The majority attempts\nto salvage the usefulness of the statement to their argument by describing it is as “persuasive\nauthority, which this court may not ignore.” Majority Op. at 11. Of course, this court ignores (or\nat least does not rule in accordance with) persuasive authority all the time. In particular, an ex post\nexegesis written by a different Justice of another Justice’s opinion that did not prevail on the point\nat issue is hardly the strongest type of persuasive authority.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 64\n\n\nviable the argument that Justice Powell’s rationale represented Bakke’s holding regarding the\ndiversity issue under Marks, while the other district court found Marks inapplicable.\n\nC. The Dicta Problem\n\n       Lastly, I pause to point out that, even if the majority’s application of Marks were correct, it\nwould not be clear that the various discussions of permissible rationales to be found in Justices\nPowell and Brennan’s opinions are anything more than non-binding dicta. This is because there is\nan argument that Bakke does not have a “judgment” with respect to the permissible use of race in\neducational institutions’ admissions policies, so there would be no Marks holding on that issue.\n\n        In order to understand the argument, it needs to be noted again that there were potentially two\nissues in Bakke – (1) whether state universities could use race at all in their admissions decisions,\nand (2) whether the university’s particular use of race was permissible. Justice Powell’s opinion\nstated the judgment of the Court on the first issue, because he was joined by Brennan’s group of four\nto make a majority for the proposition that state universities were not completely precluded from the\nuse of race. Justice Powell’s opinion stated the judgment of the Court on the second issue, because\nhe was joined by the other four Justices in finding that UC Davis’s particular system was\nimpermissible.\n\n        In his Bakke concurrence and dissent, Justice Stevens argued that Justice Powell’s discussion\nof the first issue was merely dicta, as the California Supreme Court did nothing more than strike\ndown UC Davis’s program and neither had before it nor decided the question of whether state\nuniversities could ever use race. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 408. See also Earl M. Maltz, A Bakke\nPrimer, 32 Okla. L. Rev. 119, 130 n.91 (1979) (making this argument). Allan Bakke’s suit was not\na class action; Bakke sought merely his own admission. Ibid. Therefore, once the Court ordered\nBakke admitted, he no longer had any interest in UC Davis’s future admissions policy. Ibid.\nAccordingly, Justice Stevens argued that the only judgment of the Court was that UC Davis’s system\nwas impermissible, and the narrowest grounds for holding that would seem to be Justice Stevens’s\nfinding that the system was impermissible under Title VI (due to the long-standing rule, cited by\nJustice Stevens, that the Court avoids constitutional issues if a case can fairly be decided on a\nstatutory ground). See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 411. See also Johnson v. Board of Regents, 106 F. Supp.\n2d 1362, 1369 (S.D. Ga. 2000) (same argument), aff’d, 263 F.3d 1239 (11th Cir. 2001).\n\n       It is true that both Justice Powell and the Brennan group argued that the Court was issuing\na judgment on the permissibility of the use of race, as they contended that the California Supreme\nCourt did permanently enjoin any use of race. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 271 n.1 (Powell, concurring),\n325 (Brennan, concurring). Specifically, Justice Powell pointed out that the University had cross\nclaimed in the trial court for a declaratory judgment that its program was constitutional, but that it\nhad lost. See id. at 271 n.1. Presumably, then, Justice Powell was arguing that unlike Bakke, the\nUniversity had an ongoing interest in the content of its future policies. Further, Justice Powell\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 65\n\n\nargued that the California Supreme Court effectively enjoined the University from ever using race.\nJustice Powell quoted language from the California Supreme Court to the effect that UC Davis’s\nadmissions policy was constitutionally impermissible to the extent that it was “utilized in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner.” Ibid., quoting 553 P.2d 1152, 1166 (Cal. 1976) (footnote omitted).\n\n         At least one commentator has challenged Justice Powell’s contention that the Bakke\ndiscussion on the more general use of race represents a holding. See Maltz, 32 Okla. L. Rev. at 130\nn.91 (arguing that this portion of the Bakke decision is merely dicta). Maltz points out that while it\nis true that UC Davis cross claimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that its policies were legal, it\ndid not request that the court in the alternative instruct it how to conform its policies to the law.\nInstead, according to Maltz, once the Court determined that UC Davis’s plan was infirm, it by\nimplication disposed of the cross-claim and had fulfilled its function as a reviewing court. Ibid.\nFurther, as Maltz points out, while the California Supreme Court did use the sweeping language cited\nby Justice Powell for the proposition that the court had enjoined any future use of race, the judgment\nof the California court was much narrower and included no such injunction. See 553 P.2d at 1172.\n\n        More fundamentally, the holding/dicta distinction demands that we consider binding only\nthat which was necessary to resolve the question before the Court. At most, the question before the\nCourt in Bakke was whether race could ever be used in admissions decisions. To resolve that\nquestion, the Court only needed to answer that race could potentially be used. Any speculation\nregarding the circumstances under which race could be used was little more than an advisory\nopinion, as those circumstances were not before the court and need not be validated to overturn an\ninjunction barring any use of race, to the extent one was in place.\n\n        So, if we admit that a Marks analysis simply does not provide a binding holding on the\ndiversity issue, we are left with precedent striking down UC Davis’s admissions system and either\nbinding precedent or persuasive support (depending on whether one agrees with Justice Stevens’s\nargument in Bakke that the entire rationale discussion was dicta) for the proposition embodied in\nSection V-C of Justice Powell’s opinion, to which a majority of the Justices did subscribe, that “the\nState has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions\nprogram involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.” 438 U.S. at 320.\nUnfortunately, we are not reviewing the UC Davis program, and the fact that a state has a\n“substantial interest” that “may” be constitutionally served by admissions programs utilizing race\ndoes not help us. We must determine whether the state has a “compelling interest” rather than a\n“substantial interest” and the fact that an interest “may” be served by a race-based system does\nnothing to tell us “how” it may be.\n\nD. Intervening Supreme Court Precedent\n\n       Having held that Marks does not compel a Bakke holding, the district court in this case\nreviewed recent Supreme Court cases that have addressed racial classifications, and held that\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 66\n\n\ntogether they make clear that “racial classifications are unconstitutional unless they are intended to\nremedy carefully documented effects of past discrimination.” Grutter, 137 F. Supp. 2d 821, 849\n(E.D. Mich. 2001). The court found this holding to be required by two Supreme Court cases. First,\nthe court cited Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995), where the Court held that\nall racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny and overturned Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.\nFCC, 497 U.S. 547 (1990), to the extent that it applied intermediate scrutiny to a plan that used racial\nclassifications in awarding broadcast licenses in order to enhance broadcast diversity. Second, the\ncourt noted that in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989), the Court stated that:\n“Classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for\nremedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial\nhostility.”10\n\n        Taking together the Court’s overturning of the standard used to uphold the use of race to\nencourage diversity in Metro Broadcasting (thereby calling into question the permissibility of using\nrace for diversity purposes) and its statement in Croson that race should only be used for remedial\nsettings, the district court held that the only permissible use of race under strict scrutiny is to “remedy\ncarefully documented effects of past discrimination,” and that since the diversity rationale proffered\nby the Law School was not tied to remedying past discrimination, it is an impermissible basis for the\nuse of race. Grutter, 137 F. Supp. 2d at 849.\n\n        The majority, as it does in the rest of its opinion, disregards the district court’s analysis by\nadherence to the mantra of a Bakke holding that diversity is a permissible rationale for the use of\nrace. Accordingly, the majority states that the later Supreme Court cases pointed to by the district\ncourt can not possibly stand for the proposition the court said they do because that would require a\nfinding that the Supreme Court silently overturned its holding in Bakke. As the majority points out,\nthe Court has instructed lower courts not to find that it has implicitly overruled itself, but to let it do\nits own overruling. Majority Op. at 11. See also Agostini v. Feldman, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997).\nHowever, application of Agostini requires first that the Supreme Court have made a holding that a\nlower court is finding it to have implicitly overruled; in this case, Bakke provides no such holding.\n\n         While I find persuasive the district court’s attempt to derive from the Supreme Court’s\nAdarand and Croson decisions a holding that diversity is not a permissible rationale, it would be\nsomewhat disingenuous of me to fault the majority of this court for divining a firm and binding\nholding from Bakke while urging the court to do the same from Adarand and Croson. While the\ndistrict court’s reading of these two cases is far from clearly wrong, it is also not required. In\n\n\n        10\n          Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices White and Kennedy joined this part of Justice\nO’Connor’s plurality opinion. Justice Scalia agreed that the use of race is only appropriate for\nremedial situations, but wrote separately to contend that it was appropriate only in a more limited\nset of situations than those approved by the plurality. See 488 U.S. at 735 (Scalia, concurring).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 67\n\n\nAdarand, the Court overturned Metro Broadcasting to the extent that it utilized intermediate scrutiny\nin reviewing a classification plan intended to promote diversity. However, the Court did not\nexplicitly state that diversity would not withstand strict scrutiny. Further, in Croson, while a\nmajority of the Court could be read to suggest that only remedial justifications would be permissible,\na diversity rationale was not at issue in the case.\n\n        A better approach is simply to address the diversity rationale on the merits. Accordingly, I\nwill seek to apply on the merits the rule on which we can all agree, as set forth by the Court in\nAdarand, and look to see (1) if the use of race in admissions for diversity purposes serves a\ncompelling governmental interest, and (2) whether the Law School’s plan is narrowly tailored to\nachieve that interest. Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227.\n\nII. On the Merits\n\n       Symptomatic of its deference to the advisory opinion of one Justice of the United States\nSupreme Court, the majority has given us no argument as to why the engineering of a diverse student\nbody should be a compelling state interest sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny. I, however, consider\nthe arguments on both sides of this question below and conclude that constructing a diverse\neducational environment is not a compelling state interest. In explaining my conclusion below, I\nanalyze why the nature and benefits of the experiential “diversity” that the Law School claims\nultimately to seek is conceptually disconnected from the racial and ethnic diversity that it primarily\nseeks. I also demonstrate that the Law School’s concept of diversity permits no logical limitation\nand threatens to justify even more constitutionally unacceptable outcomes, counseling against\nrecognizing its achievement as a compelling state purpose.\n\n        If I were deciding this case for a majority, I likely would not have resolved the question of\nwhether developing a diverse student body is a compelling state interest. Even if a racial\nclassification is designed to achieve a compelling state interest, it must be narrowly tailored to that\ninterest. While I could conceive of racial preferences in admission that are narrowly tailored to\nachieve some diversity in education, the Law School’s plan is not among those. The majority\nappears satisfied that the Law School’s program is narrowly tailored because the Law School has not\narticulated a precise numerical target for admitted minorities. By carefully avoiding the pernicious\nterm “quota,” the Law School, for the majority, has withstood the constitutional strict scrutiny that\nwe apply to racial preferences. For me, however, the Law School’s simple avoidance of an explicit\nnumerical target does not meet the constitutional requirements of narrow tailoring. The Law\nSchool’s efforts to achieve a “critical mass” are functionally indistinguishable from a numerical\nquota.\n\n        Moreover, the constitutional inquiry into narrow tailoring is not merely one into the form of\nthe racial preference. The sheer magnitude of the Law School’s racial preference, a feature left\ncompletely unexamined by the majority, is simply too large to be considered narrowly tailored. Even\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 68\n\n\n“the Harvard Plan,” which the majority remarkably considers constitutional merely because Justice\nPowell in Bakke speculated that it might be constitutional, does not validate the amount of the Law\nSchool’s racial preference.\n\n        I discuss the two parts of the strict scrutiny analysis – the existence of a compelling state\ninterest and the employment of only those means narrowly tailored to that purpose – separately\nbelow.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 69\n\n\nA. Is Developing a Diverse Student Body a Compelling State Interest?\n\n        1. The Nature of “Diversity”\n\n        Holding that, generally speaking, “diversity in education” is a compelling state interest would\nnot be terribly helpful. After all, it is not clear what the term means. From the outset therefore, it\nis crucial to be precise about the nature of the “diversity” that the Law School seeks to promote.\nJustice Powell discussed a diversity that would enrich the pedagogical activities of a school, a\ndiversity of “experiences, outlooks, and ideas” that would challenge its students’ settled\npreconceptions and open them to new intellectual paradigms. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314. The Law\nSchool adopts this dialogic vision of diversity as the purpose behind its admissions program.\n\n        Some versions of diversity are clearly not included in the Law School’s vision. For example,\nthe Law School does not seem to promote the potential for moral education in racial tolerance\ncreated by a more diverse student body. On this view, the mere presence of minority students may\nindeed be sufficient to enhance the educational experience. Similarly, the Law School does not seem\nto rely on the promotion of post-graduation diversity in the legal profession.\n\n       Instead, the Law School rests its claim to the benefits of a diverse student body on the unique\nexperiences that students from under-represented groups will be able to share with their fellow\nstudents. Closely related, the Law School implies that a student body diverse with regard to race is\none diverse with regard to viewpoint, experience, and opinion. Through the Socratic Method, the\nkeystone of legal education, the students from groups otherwise “over-represented” will be pressed\nto consider new ideas as their previously under-represented minority colleagues discuss the legal\nquestions at issue.\n\n         For all these educational benefits to diversity, the majority uses the shorthand “academic\ndiversity.” Majority Op. at 15. From the implementation of the Law School’s program, however,\nit is perfectly clear that academics has nothing to do with the type of diversity sought. After listening\nto the Law School extoll the virtues of educational diversity, one might think that preference would\nbe given across the board for “life experiences.” The Law School’s rhetoric implies that it is\nsearching tirelessly for the applicant with the most unique of experiences: for example, the Mormon\nmissionary in Uganda, the radical libertarian or Marxist, the child of subsistence farmers in\nArkansas, or perhaps the professional jazz musician. The Law School, however, never claims that\nthere is any similarity between the preference given to those with such unique experiences and that\nbestowed upon those it considers “under-represented” racial minorities.\n\n        Most poignantly, the Law School’s offering of non-racial exemplars for such non-racial\ndiversity betrays the profound and experientially unrelated preference that the Law School places on\nrace. Mentioning status as an under-represented minority in the same breath, the Law School\ngeneralizes, in the abstract, that it would also give a preference to an applicant with “an Olympic\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 70\n\n\ngold medal, a Ph.D in physics, the attainment of age 50 in a class otherwise lacking anyone over 30,\nor the experience of having been a Vietnamese boat person.” Admissions Policies, University of\nMichigan Law School, April 22, 1992, JA at 4240. Yet to equate bare racial status with the\nexperiential gains of these generally remarkable (and exceedingly rare) achievements demonstrates\nthat the Law School’s desired diversity is unrelated to the experiences of its applicants. After\nreading the description of its admissions criteria, a Michigan law student might yearn to meet the\nmere Olympian who failed to medal and was thus considered insufficiently interesting by the Law\nSchool.\n\n        The disjunction between the Law School’s preference for the race of “under-represented\nminorities” and what happened to be those applicants’ experiences came through very clearly in an\nexchange at oral argument. Counsel for the Law School agreed that it was true that Ms. Grutter\nwould have been admitted had she been of a different race, but strongly asserted that she would have\nthen been “a different person.” Tr. at 38. Of course, in a trivial way, that is true of every change in\nany of us. Had she grown up in New York or had a mother or father who did or did not work outside\nthe home, she would also have been a different person. However, none of those changes, all of\nwhich would have made her “diverse” in some different fashion, would have enhanced or determined\nher chances of admission. When I then asked counsel whether, if she were of a different race, she\nwould have been admitted whether she had come of age in inner-city Detroit or in Grosse Pointe, he\nanswered: “That’s probably right.” Id. at 39.\n\n         When it comes to a choice between admitting a conventionally liberal (or conventionally\nconservative) black student who is the child of lawyer parents living in Grosse Pointe, just like the\nprevious ten white admittees, the black student will be given a diversity preference that would not\nbe given to a white or Asian student, her unique experiences notwithstanding.11 Similarly, it is not\nat all clear how true diversity is served by giving massive preference to a student whose parents or\ngrandparents came from an upper-class suburb of Buenos Aires, over those whose grandparents\nimmigrated from similar areas of Paris, Munich, or Tokyo or, indeed, over a person whose\ngrandparents survived the labor camps of Hitler or Stalin or the conformity regime of Brezhnev’s\nKazakhstan. Even Justice Powell in his Bakke opinion recognized that an admissions program\n“focused solely on ethnic diversity, would hinder rather than further attainment of genuine diversity.”\n Bakke, 438 U.S. at 315 (Powell, concurring).\n\n       Perhaps the one unifying feature of the minority groups that the Law School heavily prefers\nin admissions is that they all, on average, have had some experience with being the object of racial\ndiscrimination. For law students, this might bring an understanding of the purposes behind the anti-\ndiscrimination laws that they might study. It is hard, however, to believe that the Law School’s\n\n\n       11\n         With respect to the concurring opinion’s criticism of this example, Concurring Op. at n.3\n(Clay), see n.21 infra.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 71\n\n\nadmissions scheme is terribly sensitive to this interest. If the Law School were truly interested in\nthose with profound experience with discrimination, it would be sensitive to differences within the\naffected groups. An African-American applicant who comes to the Law School by way of Choate\nand Harvard12 may well have quite a different experience of discrimination than one from a rural\npublic school. Even if one were to believe that the Law School’s racial preference were carefully\ndesigned to add such experience to the Law School mixing pot, one could wonder why an experience\nwith discrimination would be so much more important than any other experience germane to other\nlegal issues.\n\n        Indeed, one should wonder why race is at all relevant to the Law School if it only is\nconcerned about the diversity of experience. It is likely that an admissions scheme that sought true\nexperiential diversity, without regard to race, would provide some systematic advantage for racial\nor ethnic minorities. See also Part II.B.4 (discussing race-neutral means). Under-represented life\nexperiences – primary or secondary education at an under-funded public school, struggling with\nrelative poverty, a childhood spent in urban rather than suburban areas – may correlate to some\ndegree with under-represented racial or ethnic minorities.13\n\n        Such a system of seeking experiential diversity would be unlikely to raise significant\nconstitutional problems, unless it were clear that an institution manipulated these factors to admit\nmembers of a particular race. However, the Law School certainly does not seek to implement an\nexperientially based admissions system or even to assert that if it did, the preference given for such\nfactors could explain its current results. Instead, it is clear that the only type of diversity that is given\nmore than modest, if any, weight is based on assigned racial categories. The Law School cannot\nplausibly maintain that the system would be impractical, especially because, as they elsewhere\nremind us for purposes of distinguishing its preference from a quota, only one admissions officer\nreads all applications, makes all decisions, and therefore is capable of considering candidates\nindividually. The possibility of an experientially based admissions system and the Law School’s\napparent disinterest in such a system, indicate that the Law School grants preference to race, not as\na proxy for a unique set of experiences, but as a proxy for race itself.\n\n\n\n\n        12\n         Indeed, it is likely such minorities – those who have been relatively well-educated at elite\nschools, but who have not performed terribly well there – that the Law School’s preference policy\nmost benefits.\n        13\n          In fact, these factors may also correlate to unrealized academic ability, if the student has not\nhad sufficient resources, educational or financial, to blossom intellectually. In this sense, an\nadmissions system truly sensitive to experiential diversity may also select the more intellectually\ntalented.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 72\n\n\n        Accordingly, even if we were to consider binding on this court Justice Powell’s opinion in\nBakke that the achievement of some form of diversity in education is a compelling state interest, we\nwould not ipso facto find compelling the type of diversity that the Law School apparently seeks. For\nJustice Powell in Bakke, race or ethnicity was only “one element in a range of factors” that an\neducational institution may consider to develop an experientially heterogeneous environment.\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 314. The Law School’s consideration of race, for the sake of race, is not the type\nof pedagogical diversity thought potentially compelling in Powell’s opinion.\n\n        There are yet more fundamental problems with the broad-brush rationale of diversity. The\nfundamental premise of our society is that each person is equally “diverse” exactly because of her\nequality before God and the law. The very words of the Declaration of Independence are: “All men\nare created equal . . . and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.” Thus, the\nstarting basis is one of equality, not of separately assigned categories that are used to measure\ndiversity. From that starting point, every person’s experiences are “diverse” from those of every\nother. The very measure of diversity as used by the University is to say that some of those\ndifferences do not count. Thus, to the Law School, ten under-represented-minority students, each\na child of two-parent lawyer families, are considered to be diverse, while children whose parents are\nChinese merchants, Japanese farmers, white steel workers, or any combinations of the above are all\nconsidered to be part of a homogeneous (and “over-represented”) mass. And, of course, that\ncategorization then strongly determines the odds of admission. A child with one parent of Chinese\nancestry and one of Chilean would find that his level of “diversity” depends wholly on whether the\nLaw School chooses to assign him based on one parent or the other.14\n\n         The Law School gives no explanation of how it defines the groups to be favored. This means\nthat ultimately it must make, on some basis, a decision on who is, and is not, an “African-American,\nHispanic, or Native American.” See JA at 1957 (discussing the groups to be favored). Such\njudgments, of course, have a long and sordid history. The classic Southern Rule was that any\nAfrican ancestry, or “one drop” of African blood, made one black.15 The Nazi Nuremberg laws\n\n\n\n       14\n          A personal observation makes clear for me the problematic nature of such definitions. My\ndaughter has one grandparent who was a Cuban immigrant, two grandparents of Russian Jewish\norigin, and one grandparent who could be characterized as a Euro-American mixture. I would hate\nto think that her life chances were significantly altered, favorably or unfavorably, because a\ngovernment body applied a “grandfather clause” that focused on one rather than another of her\ngrandparents.\n       15\n         For more on the one-drop rule, see A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. & F. Michael Higginbotham,\n“Yearning to Breathe Free”: Legal Barriers Against and Options in Favor of Liberty in Antebellum\nVirginia, 68 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1213, 1243 n.163 (1993).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 73\n\n\nmade the fatal decision turn on the number of Jewish grandparents.16 “Hispanic” background may,\nI suppose, depend on which side of a pass in the Pyrenees your great-grandfather came from. This\nChristmas, my wife and I received a card, containing a lovely picture of a friend and his spouse, their\ntwo children and their spouses, and four grandchildren. I asked a sample of people, in and out of my\nchambers, how many of the ten people in the picture should receive racial preference under\nMichigan’s policy. I received answers ranging from one to ten.\n\n         A moment’s contemplation of these examples shows another serious problem with\nMichigan’s policies. On the one hand, all the evidence is that race and ethnicity are considered on\nan “all or nothing” basis. But the actual experience, diverse or otherwise, of a person who is “one-\nhalf” or “one-quarter” of one ethnicity, is likely to be, on average, different from one whose ancestry\nis relatively uniform. On the other hand, to apply boldly a system of half- or quarter-credit for\nassigned status would reveal the racist nature of the system to a degree from which even its\nproponents would shrink.\n\n       Thus, even if we give full force to Justice Powell’s discussion of “the virtues of diversity,”\nthe Law School’s program provides the linguistic term, but not the substance.\n\n       2. No Logical Limitation\n\n        We are not completely at sea regarding how to discern a compelling state interest. The\nSupreme Court has consistently rejected those purposes that lack a “logical stopping point.” Croson,\n488 U.S. at 498; Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 275 (1986) (plurality opinion). Such\nvague and ill-defined purposes, if considered compelling, would eviscerate the constitutional\nprotection that strict scrutiny provides. The two requirements of strict scrutiny – the identification\nof a compelling state interest and the use of only those means narrowly tailored to serve that interest\n– are designed to be independently meaningful rather than mere redundancies. Yet it is meaningless\nto require that a state narrowly tailor its suspect policies to a purpose that itself is poorly defined.\n\n        Requiring a well-defined purpose to be compelling reflects the Supreme Court’s judgment\nthat racial classifications ought to be used sparingly. The Law School’s repeated incantation of\n“developing a diverse student body” suffers from this vice of vagueness. These same words, together\nwith the discussion of promoting a more intriguing student body, could be used, and indeed have\nbeen used not invalidly on their face, to justify ethnic classifications that seem patently\nunconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n        See, e.g., Lucy S. Dawidowicz, THE WAR AGAINST THE JEWS: 1933-45 91 (Bantam 1975);\nNora Levin, THE HOLOCAUST 69-70 (Schocken 1973).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 74\n\n\n        It may be instructive to compare the actual implementation of and articulated rationale behind\nthe Michigan plan with another, possibly well-intentioned, attempt to manipulate admissions criteria\nto achieve a diverse student body. I refer to the “religious-conscious” policies, adopted by a number\nof Ivy League universities of which Harvard was the most notable, to give preference in admissions\nto Gentiles as opposed to Jews. The policies were also designed to produce a mixture of students\nin the school that was closer to the proportion that prevailed in society, and a proportion that was\nthought to be socially and educationally beneficial.\n\n        The reasons for the policy offered by then-President Lowell of Harvard are hauntingly similar\nto the rationale given here. As Lowell explained, without the policies “Harvard would lose its\ncharacter as a democratic national university drawing from all classes of the community and\npromoting a sympathetic understanding among them.” Letter from President Lowell, reprinted in\nHenry Aaron Yeomans, ABBOTT LAWRENCE LOWELL , 1856-1943 209 (Arno 1977). Lowell worried\nthat “race feeling would become intense” if numbers of students were not more proportional to the\ngeneral population, and that if the numerical imbalance could be rectified, “it would eliminate race\nfeeling among the students, and ‘as these students passed out into the world, eliminating it in the\ncommunity.’” Nitza Rosovsky, THE JEWISH EXPERIENCE AT HARVARD AND RADCLIFFE 15 & n.2\n(Harvard 1986) (quoting A. Lawrence Lowell Papers # 1056). Lowell also believed that his policy\nwould be “in the interests of Jews, as well as of everyone else.” Ibid.\n\n        The weighted preference system at Harvard then worked much the same as Michigan’s. The\n“Harvard plan” of its day also considered each applicant individually. Some Jews were admitted,\nsome were not. Their religion was only one factor among many that were considered. It was\nperfectly clear, in the words of Justice Powell, that “the applicant who loses out on the last available\nseat to another candidate receiving a ‘plus’ on the basis of ethnic background will not have been\nforeclosed from all consideration for that seat.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 318. Those who were not\nadmitted could not be certain that their ethnicity had been decisive. All applicants admitted were\ncertainly “qualified,” by the same standards as the Michigan plan.\n\n        Perhaps the crucial distinction comes from the notion that a true “plus” program would lack\na “facial intent to discriminate.” Ibid. This could only be the case if the plus was in some fashion\nmodest, and calibrated truly in connection with other comparable characteristics. The fact that the\n“Harvard plan” of the 1930's basically cut Jewish numbers by half or more would belie the lack of\na “facial intent to discriminate.” See generally Marcia Graham Synnott, THE HALF -OPENED DOOR\n96, 108, 110, 115 (Greenwood 1979). The University of Michigan’s plan, which by its own\ncalculations inflates the numbers of students from favored groups approximately three-to-four fold,\nsimilarly betrays a “facial intent to discriminate.” See JA at 6047.\n\n        It is thus important to note that the Michigan policy, though unintentionally, has an effect\nsimilar to that of the Harvard plan of old. The effect is similar, in my view, because a significant\nproportion of those persons who are excluded because of racial discrimination in favor of under-\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 75\n\n\nrepresented minorities are Jews. While no specific numbers have been given, a wide variety of\nsources indicate that Jewish representation in general in law schools is several multiples of the\nproportion of Jews in the general population. There is no reason to believe that as a proportion of\nthose excluded by Michigan’s policies, the impact would be any different.\n\n         If policies like the Law School’s are permitted, the adverse effect on “over-represented”\nminorities will only grow more grave because such policies inexorably drive toward a philosophy\nin which admissions are parceled out roughly in proportion to representation in the general\npopulation. The Law School may deny this, and argue that the policy is only for “under-represented”\nminorities. But, if suitably divided, any group can become a minority. If one distinguishes between\ndenominations of Christianity, no religion is a majority in America. Using only the constitutionally\nprotected classes of national origin, no ethnic background is a majority. Thus, by the rationale of\nMichigan’s policy, every group suitably defined could be entitled to “a critical mass” of its members\nso that those students, too, should “not feel isolated or like spokespersons” nor “feel uncomfortable\ndiscussing issues freely based on their personal experiences.” Majority Op. at 15. And then, by the\ninexorable laws of mathematics, the existence of a critical mass or rough proportionality for each\ngroup so considered means that what is left for the remainder of the groups (those formerly “over-\nrepresented”) is no more than its own critical mass of “rough proportionality.” And there lies the rub.\nBeing relegated to rough proportionality brings Jewish applicants full circle to their chances under\nLowell’s “Harvard Plan,” or even worse, as Jews today constitute only 2-3% of the total population.\nThe Law School and the court will certainly deny this, but that is where the figures unavoidably lead\nus.\n\n        These prospects for such uninhibited racial and ethnic discrimination are especially important\nbecause the Law School has declined to justify its policy as remedying past discrimination.17 There\nis no limiting principle preventing the Law School from employing ethnic or religious preferences\nto arrange its student body by critical mass. In short, the compelling state interest of developing a\n\n\n\n\n       17\n         The Law School’s disavowal is why I do not discuss whether the remediation of past\ndiscrimination is a compelling state interest that could justify the Law School’s actions. Not only\nmust a state interest be compelling to satisfy strict scrutiny, but it must also be the interest that\nmotivated the classification in the first instance. While we have been reluctant to determine what\nactually motivated legislative bodies, see, e.g., Federal Communications Comm’n v.

Is the Law School’s Admissions Policy Narrowly Tailored?\n\n        If pressed, however, it would be unnecessary to determine whether promoting diversity in\neducation constitutes a compelling state interest because we, just as Justice Powell in Bakke, are not\nfaced with an admissions scheme that is narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest\nof diversity in education. For the majority, the inquiry into narrow tailoring begins and ends with\na determination that the Law School neither “sets aside” an exact number of seats for racial or ethnic\nminorities nor admits minorities with a specific quota of admittees in mind. The distinction of\nquotas from other preferences is the dividing line between constitutional and unconstitutional\nadmissions policies, on this view. For this position, the majority points to the Harvard plan, not of\nLowell’s time, but the one of which Justice Powell, on the basis of no factual record but only a bland\ndescription appended to an amicus brief, spoke approvingly in Bakke. That plan, using race only as\na “plus,” does not offend the Constitution according to the majority because of Powell’s advisory\nopinion on its constitutionality. Therefore, the majority would hold that all plans that merely use\nrace as a “plus” are constitutional. Yet, the constitutional analysis of racial preferences appears to\nbe binary for the majority in that a preference is either a forbidden quota or a permissible plus.\n\n        We must be, however, concerned about the magnitude of this preference. Even assuming,\nagainst all doubt, that Justice Powell’s opinion on the constitutionality of a plan not any part of the\n\n\n       18\n          Because of our society’s history of religious discrimination and religion’s continuing\nsalience, I have at times recognized the analogy between religious preference and the racial and\nethnic preference bestowed in this case. For example, at oral argument I questioned counsel about\nthe constitutionality of engineering a critical mass of Southern Baptists at the Law School. Counsel\nfor the Law School attempted to deflect this analogy by arguing that a religious preference of the\nsame form as the Law School’s racial and ethnic preference would raise “special” constitutional\nproblems of “getting entangled” with religion in violation of the “First Amendment.” Tr. at 16-17.\nIn essence, counsel’s argument was that an admissions policy with religious preferences that would\ncomport with the Equal Protection Clause could nevertheless violate the Establishment Clause. I\ncould find no case or even analytic argument for the proposition that a policy, pursuing a compelling\nstate interest and tailored narrowly to that interest, could violate the Establishment Clause. Cf. Droz\nv. CIR, 48 F.3d 1120, 1122 (9th Cir. 1995) (noting the relevance of the strict scrutiny framework to\nthe First Amendment inquiry). With as much justification as the Law School disclaims any invidious\nanimus toward “over-represented” groups in its policy, comparable discrimination against “over-\nrepresented” religious groups could be said not to represent the establishment of all other religions\nor the irreligious. I am convinced that the analogy, and therefore the inevitable implications, of the\nLaw School’s constitutional argument here, hold.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 77\n\n\ncase or controversy before the Court could be a holding binding on this court, I cannot believe that\na “plus” of any size, no matter how large, would be therefore constitutional. I believe that the Law\nSchool’s preference is just too large to be narrowly tailored.\n\n        My analysis of the narrow tailoring defects of the Law School admissions scheme falls into\nfour parts. First, I detail the true magnitude of the Law School’s preference. Second, I explain why\nwe cannot draw a meaningful distinction between the Law School’s attempts to achieve a “critical\nmass” of under-represented minorities and the quotas that the majority concedes to be\nunconstitutional. Third, I question whether a strong racial preference bears any demonstrable\nrelationship to the claimed benefits of educational pluralism. Fourth and finally, I suggest some\nrace-neutral means of achieving the Law School’s avowed ends that the Law School has not pursued.\n\n       1. The True Magnitude of the Law School’s Racial Preference\n\n        Because the majority has not laid out the magnitude of the discrimination revealed by the\nrecord, it is important to detail it here. An examination of the admissions data shows that even the\nmost qualified majority19 students (those with an LSAT over 170 and a GPA over 3.75) do not\nachieve the perfect admissions percentages for under-represented minority students with a GPA\nnearly a point less and an LSAT score in the 164-66 range. More roughly speaking, under-\nrepresented minorities with a high C to low B undergraduate average are admitted at the same rate\nas majority applicants with an A average with roughly the same LSAT scores.20 Along a different\naxis, minority applicants with an A average and an LSAT score down to 156 (the 70th percentile\nnationally) are admitted at roughly the same rate as majority applicants with an A average and an\nLSAT score over a 167 (the 96th percentile nationally).\n\n       The figures indicate that race is worth over one full grade point of college average or at least\nan 11-point and 20-percentile boost on the LSAT. In effect, the Law School admits students by\ngiving very substantial additional weight to virtually every candidate designated as an “under-\nrepresented minority” or, equivalently, by substantially discounting the credentials earned by every\nstudent who happens to fall outside the Law School’s minority designation.\n\n        For the potential applicant, the Law School’s system creates very different dilemmas\ndepending on his race. If confronted a year before they applied to the Law School with the records\nof two students, whose non-racial credentials were equivalent, we might evaluate their prospects for\nadmission as follows: Student A could work harder and raise her GPA by a full point. Student B\n\n\n\n\n       19\n            Meaning, for these purposes, those students who are not “under-represented minorities.”\n       20\n            JA at 603, 605. Comparison between students in the 167-169 LSAT range in 1997.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 78\n\n\ncould reveal the fact of his skin color or ethnicity, it being in one of the preferred categories.21 The\nLaw School’s admissions officer, who before both changes would have rated the students equally,\nwould now find the students equal, the effort of the one being counterbalanced by the background\nof the other.\n\n        More shocking is the comparison of the chances of admission for applicants with the same\nacademic credentials (at least numerically). Taking a middle-range applicant with an LSAT score\n164-66 and a GPA of 3.25-3.49, the chances of admission for a white or Asian applicant are around\n22 percent. For an under-represented minority applicant, the chances of admission (100%) would\nbe better called a guarantee of admission.\n\n        At some point, however, comparison of the admissions rates of white, Asian, and other\nunselected ethnic applicants and the minority groups designated for preference becomes impossible.\nThe Law School simply stops meaningful consideration of non-minority candidates below certain\ngrade point and LSAT figures,22 a practice demonstrated by admissions rates well below 10 percent,\nand often the absence of a single admitted student, in these credential categories. “Under-\nrepresented minorities,” on the other hand, not only continue to have respectable chances of\nadmission in these categories, but in most cases enjoy rates of admission in excess of 80 percent.23\nFar from receiving “competitive consideration,” majority applicants are all but summarily rejected\nwith credentials, but not ethnicity, identical to their under-represented minority “competitors” who\nare virtually guaranteed admission. The Law School’s admissions practices betray its claim that it\ngives meaningful individual consideration to every applicant notwithstanding their race.\n\n\n\n       21\n           While it should not be necessary to make this point, the use of hypotheticals or examples\nthat illustrate the effective impact of the policies under consideration is in no way a commentary on\nspecific persons. If a policy has real effects that seem impolite or offensive, that is a result of the\npolicy, not of those who point it out.\n       22\n          Majority applicants with an A average and LSAT over 164 enjoy admission rates over 40%.\nAs their grades slide to a high B average and an LSAT over 164, their admission rates drop to around\n20%. Below a 164, majority applicants are not admitted at a rate any more than 10%, regardless of\ntheir grade point average.\n       23\n         By comparison, designated minorities are not only considered, but admitted in rates over\n60%, and usually over 80%, with LSAT scores down to 154 and grade point averages in the low B\nrange. Even below these figures, designated minorities are still admitted at rates nearing 30% in\nmany categories of LSAT and GPA. Not until the designated minorities’ LSAT drops below 150\n(47th percentile nationally) or a GPA of 2.5 do we see admission rates under 10% for designated\nminorities.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 79\n\n\n          The sharp threshold for admission that the Law School appears to establish for majority\napplicants reveals the emptiness of another purported justification for its racial preference. The Law\nSchool justifies its stark preference, in part, by claiming that all the applicants admitted, even those\nadmitted because of its preference, are “qualified.” If the Law School actually believed that all\napplicants, with combinations of credentials sufficient for admission for minorities, were truly\n“qualified,” it would likely be willing at least to consider admitting majority applicants who were\nequally “qualified.” Instead, the Law School reveals its true views regarding the necessary\ncredentials for its law students through its clear line in its admission of majority candidates: students\nbelow the credential threshold either diminish the educational environment of the school or spare\nit only if kept to a small percentage of the class.\n\n       In the alternative, the Law School’s process designates as “qualified” virtually all who apply\nfor admission. If the Law School is being honest, it considers every last under-represented minority\nadmitted “qualified.” Indeed, the admissions data reveal that the Law School admits nearly every\nminority student who meets threshold credentials, as there appears to be a sharp cliff in rates of\nadmission between extremely small variations in objective credentials.24 If the Law School considers\neveryone above this minority threshold “qualified,” it must also consider the 89 percent of the\napplicant pool above this threshold “qualified.” Yet it is clear that the Law School would not be\ncomfortable with the random admission of any of the 89% of its applicant pool. The Law School\ndoes not truly consider majority applicants toward the bottom half of this 89% “qualified” – it admits\nalmost none of them.\n\n        The Law School’s use of the term “qualified” reveals its slipperiness. The court majority\nreveals the Law School’s shift in usage when it explains the rejection of a more random selection\nmethod because the school seeks to assemble “both a highly qualified and richly diverse academic\nclass.” Majority Op. at 19. The Law School appears to be all too cognizant of the difference\nbetween “highly qualified” and merely “qualified” applicants. Its two steep cliffs in the admissions\nrate, one for under-represented minority applicants and one for majority applicants, demonstrate that\nthe Law School maintains a “two-track,” indeed separated, system for admissions. Using its under-\nrepresented minority threshold, the Law School fills its seats reserved for “qualified” candidates.\nUsing its majority threshold, the Law School completes the balance of its class with “highly\nqualified” applicants. That the Law School merely seeks to insure that “all its students are qualified”\nis an empty claim.\n\n\n\n\n        24\n         For example, there is a sharp drop in rates of admission between under-represented minority\napplicants with a 154 to a 155 LSAT score and those with a 151 to a 153. With a 154 to a 155, we\nsee admission rates in excess of 60%. With a 151 to a 153, however, minorities are admitted at rates\nbelow 20%.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 80\n\n\n        The Law School argues, however, that these overwhelming data are illusions produced\nthrough the smoke of litigation. These data, standing alone, the Law School seems to claim, could\nbe produced by very small differences in actual qualifications. Taking certain hypothetical statistics,\nthe Law School’s contention could certainly hold. For example, if for some reason every applicant\nhad the same LSAT score, but every white had a GPA of 3.50 and every black had a GPA of 3.49,\na “racial preference” would be required to obtain any admission of black students, but the degree of\nthat preference would obviously be very small. The difference in chances of admission for the black\nand white applicants would still be very large, but the practical amount of preference would be very\nsmall.\n\n        However, such are not the admissions statistics in this case. As the statistics show, the\ndegree of preference can be characterized, in the benign words of Justice Powell and Harvard, as a\n“tip” only with some considerable violence to terminological exactitude.25 The term “tip” would\nconvey to the average reasonable person something that overbalances a fairly closely divided or\nnearly evenly balanced choice. A seesaw with roughly equivalent children on either end can be\n“tipped” from one side to the other with a small weight. However, if a boulder must be placed on\none side to shift the balance, the term “tip” would apply only if it were infinitely elastic. A common-\nsense view of a “tip” might be that in a zone where 80 or 90% of majority applicants are admitted,\n100% of minorities would be favored. Or, in a zone where only 10 or 20% of majority applicants\nare admitted, 30 or 40% of minorities might be. If Justice Powell’s words are to be used as anything\nmore than a subterfuge, that would be the kind of preference that a fair reading of his opinion might\nendorse.\n\n        The majority responds that there is no evidence in Bakke about how large the racial\npreference was in the Harvard plan of which Justice Powell spoke approvingly. Majority Op. at 25-\n26. As a result, it is impossible to know whether the Law School’s alleged “plus” was larger than\nHarvard’s. Majority Op. at 17. Immediately thereafter, the majority concludes that the Law School’s\nadmission scheme is “virtually identical to the Harvard plan,” and that therefore the Law School’s\nsystem must be constitutional. Ibid. How does the majority know that the Law School’s system is\n“virtually identical” to Harvard’s? I am deeply puzzled regarding how the majority could place both\nits confession of ignorance regarding the details of the Harvard plan and its claim that the two plans\nare identical in the same paragraph. The majority’s argument, yet again, simply elides empirical\npremises necessary to sustain what it claims to be the controlling analogy between the Law School\nand Harvard plans.\n\n        And indeed the majority’s recognition that there is no factual record regarding the Harvard\nplan in Bakke echoes the reason why federal courts do not issue advisory opinions on cases not\nbefore them and why we find binding only the holdings, but not the dicta, of prior cases. Without\n\n\n       25\n            Cf. United States v. Allen, 211 F.3d 970, 976 (6th Cir. 2000) (en banc).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 81\n\n\nan actual case or controversy before it, a court is not able to develop a factual record and to\ndetermine which facts would be legally relevant. The absence of a factual record on the Harvard\nplan reinforces the reasons that Justice Powell’s thoughts regarding its potential constitutionality are\nnot binding.\n\n         Even if we know nothing of the absolute magnitude of the Harvard plan other than its\ndescription as merely a “tip” or a “plus,” we have some evidence regarding its relative magnitude.\nAs described in the amicus brief before the Court in Bakke, the Harvard plan provided that “the race\nof an applicant may tip the balance in his favor just as geographic origin or life spent on a farm may\ntip the balance in other candidates’ cases.” LANDMA RK BRIEFS AND ARGUMENTS, supra n.1, at 736\n(emphasis added). From the description, it would seem that Harvard’s racial preference would be\nsimilar in magnitude to the preference given other soft factors. We know, however, from the\nindisputable statistical evidence in this case and the Law School’s own admission that no other soft\nfactor is even remotely as significant as race in its admission decisions. Additionally, there is\nnothing in the Harvard description that even hints that its preferences for race or others factors of\ndiversity are of the magnitude here, taking the chance of admission from near zero to near 100%, in\nmany cases.\n\n        It is clear from the Law School’s statistics that under-represented minority students are nearly\nautomatically admitted in zones where white or Asian students with the same credentials are nearly\nautomatically rejected. Indeed, the Law School concedes that its racial preference is sufficiently\nheavy that 3 out of 4 under-represented minority students would not be admitted if all students were\ntruly considered without regard to race. JA at 6047. The characterization of the Law School’s\npreference as only a “tip” or “plus” would eviscerate those words, and transform Powell’s thoughful\ndiscussion into a carte blanche for adopting the UC Davis system with only a few cosmetic changes.\n\n        One might wonder why I focus so heavily on the LSAT and GPA admissions data provided\nby the Law School. Of course, the constitutional deficiencies of the Michigan policy have nothing\nto do with the question of how and whether universities should consider academic measures such\nas GPA and LSAT in their admissions policies. Michigan is perfectly free to abandon or to\nrestructure those measures. However, those are the standards it has chosen to distinguish among\nmajority candidates, and to distinguish among minority candidates. Equal protection of the laws\ndemands that the objective standards that the Law School chooses are applied with some modicum\nof equality, and they are not here.26\n\n\n       26\n         The concurring opinion criticizes this statistical analysis by noting scholarship suggesting\nno good link between “numerical credentials,” presumably meaning LSAT and GPA, and “success\nin Law School.” Concurring Op. at 39-40 (Clay). My only point here is that, notwithstanding the\ndebate over more accurate measures of educational merit, the Law School undoubtedly thinks LSAT\nand GPA are most important. The only other credential that appears to be systematically important\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 82\n\n\n        Michigan argues, with some justification, that it also considers a wide variety of “soft”\nfactors. And nothing in this opinion denigrates the use of such factors, or even changing or\nincreasing them, so long as they are applied equally. However, it is of the greatest importance to\nnote that Michigan does not contend, in any way, that the consideration of those factors explains any\nadvantage, systematic or otherwise, for minority candidates. It does not make that claim in its filings\nor briefs, and I specifically put the question in oral argument: “Do you assert that under-represented\nminorities systematically have stronger [soft factors] than non-minority students?” Counsel\nresponded with a firm “no.” Tr. at 41. Thus, the issue is not the merits behind one combination of\nqualifications or another. The constitutional dilemma presented is the use, or at least the degree of\nuse, of race to overcome qualifications, however defined.\n\n       2. Differentiating a “Critical Mass,” a “Plus” and a “Quota”\n\n       As I have just explained, the preference accorded minorities in the Law School’s admissions\nscheme is different in magnitude from the “plus” or the “tip” that Justice Powell thought might be\npermissible under certain conditions. The Law School’s racial preference, however, suffers from\ndeeper problems – as it appears calibrated to admit a certain percentage of under-represented\nminority students. The Law School concedes that the preference is designed to admit a “critical\nmass” of under-represented minority students. Of course, the term “critical mass” is intentionally\nvague. When pressed, the Law School will explain that a “critical mass” is that number of students\nnecessary to enable “minority students [to] contribute to classroom dialogue and not feel isolated.”\nMajority Op. at 5. Pressed further, the Law School will not say that any particular number of\nminority students constitutes a critical mass. It seems obvious to me, however, that the Law School\nhas an opinion as to what that number is and attempts to achieve it.27\n\n       The majority summarily dispenses with this problem, approvingly quoting the comforting\nreassurances of Dean Lehman (“We do not have a portion of the class that is set aside for a critical\nmass”) without noting that in fact a critical mass is always obtained. Majority Op. at 14. And\ncomforting those words must be, as a contrary response would have produced what appears to be the\nonly manner in which a racial preference in admissions could be unconstitutional for the majority:\na quota system. Yet Harvard in the 1930's did not have to say that exactly 87 percent of the seats\n\n\n\n\nis race, and I think we should at least be candid about how much emphasis that the Law School\nplaces on race. To the extent that the concurrence mounts a more substantial attack on the use of\nnumerical credentials generally, its quarrel is with the Law School, not with my position.\n       27\n        See, e.g., Tr. at 21-24, where counsel for the Law School admitted that 3-5% would not be\nenough and that “clearly we care about the number.”\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 83\n\n\nwere set aside for Gentiles – it just had to apply an admissions system based on “character” that\nachieved roughly the same result.28\n\n        The results of the Law School’s system to produce a “critical mass” reassure us that the Law\nSchool really seeks to enroll a critical number of minority students. Between 1995 and 1998, the last\nfour years for which we have data, the Law School consistently enrolled a number of under-\nrepresented minorities constituting 13.5 to 13.7 percent of the class enrolled. The absolute numbers\nare just as consistent: 47 of 341 in 1998, 46 of 339 in 1997, 44 of 319 in 1996, and 46 of 340 in\n1995. University of Michigan Law School’s Report to the ABA, JA at 643. The statistics\ndemonstrate that the Law School was more successful at enrolling a precise number of under-\nrepresented minorities than a precise number of total students.29 It seems clear to me, at least, that\nthe “critical mass” the Law School seeks to achieve is only vague and flexible for outsiders not\nlooking at its enrollment statistics.30 The Law School’s “critical mass” of designated minorities is\n44-47 per class, or around 13.5%.\n\n        The majority and the Law School stress that minority enrollment numbers have varied,\nindicating that the Law School does not maintain a fixed target for minority admissions. The fact\n\n\n       28\n          The percentage of Harvard students who were Jewish varied between 1933-42, but was\nquite stable and well below the percentages in the 1920's. In the 1920's, the percentage consistently\napproached 30%. A glance at the 1933-42 Harvard figures, with percentages of 12.4, 9.9, 10.9, 14.8,\n14.0, 15.4, 14.4, 16.0, 14.1, and 16.1, reveals a chart that looks very much like Michigan’s with\nrespect to under-represented minorities. Synnott, THE HALF -OPENED DOOR at 115, Table 4.8 (1971).\n       29\n         Admittedly, these percentages did deviate a bit from this tight grouping in some years\nbefore 1995 being, respectively, 12%, 14%, 14%, 13%, 19%, 20%, 14%, 20%, for the years 1987-94.\nThese deviations, however, do not muddle the extraordinarily tight grouping in the last four years\nand primarily show what may have been, in the Law School’s view, “excessive” percentages in three\nof the years. Nevertheless, the lowest percentage never falls below 12%, while the Law School\nacknowledges that three-fourths of that number is accounted for by the application of its preference\npolicy.\n        Of course, even these early numbers are consistent with the Law School’s maintaining a\nnumerical target. Perhaps the Law School had a different target in those years. It is hard to know,\nbecause the Law School has failed to specify its view of “critical mass.” Perhaps the Law School\nsimply got better at exactly achieving its target.\n       30\n         There is little solace in the Law School’s unwillingness to reveal its quota. I share Justice\nBrennan’s view: “there is no basis for preferring a particular preference program simply because in\nachieving the same goals [as a quota system], it proceeds in a manner that is not immediately\napparent to the public.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 379.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 84\n\n\nthat there has been any variation (.2% over four years), trivial though it may be, in the percentage\nof students admitted who are minorities satisfies the majority that the Law School does not maintain\na quota. After all, the majority instructs us, variation produces a range, and a range will always have\na “minimum,” that might look like a number below which the Law School will not go. Majority Op.\nat 16. Such is the nature of a range, the majority says, almost suggesting that it was foolish to be\nconcerned about the question. Ibid.\n\n        I am not concerned just with the bottom of the range, but also its top. The range, as I have\ndemonstrated, is remarkably tight. Admittedly, it is not identical from year to year – but the lack of\nidentity does not seem enough to demonstrate that the Law School does not have an exceedingly\nprecise numerical target in mind when admitting its students. The fact that a quota is a range rather\nthan one specific number certainly does not insulate a program from constitutional scrutiny. In\nBakke, had UC Davis said “We’re going to reserve, oh, about 14 to 18 seats, maybe give or take a\nfew,” for minority students – and then, indeed hit that range every year, I doubt that anyone can\nseriously believe that the outcome of that case would have been different.\n\n         The majority’s reliance on such slight variations also ignores the imprecision involved in\nproducing enrollment. A law school does not admit students with perfect information regarding its\nyield, that is the percentage of students that will accept offers of admission. The yield is radically\ndependent on the idiosyncratic preferences of the students admitted. Accordingly, in a given year,\nhighly selective law schools may have ten percent variations in the overall sizes of their enrolled\nclasses, much less any desired component part. The University of Michigan Law School is no\nexception, enrolling 341 students in 1998, 339 in 1997, 319 in 1996, 340 in 1995, 363 in 1994.\nGiven these uncertainties, the quite narrow range of minority enrollment percentages that the Law\nSchool achieves is remarkable for its consistency, and it seems to me that the Law School is doing\nall it can to achieve a target number of minorities. I take no comfort in the statistically minor\nvariations in minority enrollment.\n\n        Indeed, the record makes it clear that, to take a hypothetical example, if the Law School were\nto discover near the end of its process that a large number of its admitted minority students had all\ndecided to attend other schools, thus leaving both a block of empty seats and a huge deficit in the\nsought-for “critical mass,” the Law School would bend every effort to fill those seats with minority\nstudents. Before all offers of admission are made, substantial numbers of applicants accept,\nclarifying the likely composition of each class. Law School officials testified that they vigorously\nmonitor the acceptance data with regard to race on a daily basis, see Depo. of Dennis Shields, JA at\n2219-20, perhaps to admit minorities that it otherwise would not have or perhaps to admit minorities\non the waiting list. This, of course, is the practical equivalent of the “segregated waiting lists”\ncondemned in other cases. See, e.g., Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932, 938 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n       The combination of the Law School’s thinly veiled references to such a target, its “critical\nmass,” and relatively consistent results in achieving a particular enrollment percentage, should\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 85\n\n\nconvince us that the Law School’s admissions scheme is functionally, and even nominally,\nindistinguishable from a quota system. At the very least, however, the Law School’s admission plan\nseems far from employing the mere “plus” or “tip” that the majority characterizes its racial\npreference to be.\n\n        In order for the language of “plus” or “tip” to have real meaning, there would have to be\nsome indication that the other, allegedly similar, plus factors were also of a strength that were\nanywhere near the potency of the preference here. After all, Justice Powell himself contended that,\nto be only his “plus,” race would need to be just one among many factors. As Justice Powell wrote,\n\n       “The file of a particular black applicant may be examined for his potential\n       contribution to diversity without the factor of race being decisive when compared,\n       for example, with that of an applicant identified as an Italian-American if the latter\n       is thought to exhibit qualities more likely to promote beneficial educational\n       pluralism. Such qualities could include exceptional personal talents, unique work or\n       service experience, leadership potential, maturity, demonstrated compassion, a\n       history of overcoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the poor, or other\n       qualifications deemed important.”\n\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 317 (Powell, concurring). The majority is content to accept the Law School’s\nclaim that it considers some of these “soft” factors. Majority Op. at 15. I would ask whether any\nof them are remotely comparable in weight. While not every factor would be required to bear equal\nweight under the Powell view, it seems clear that at least some of these other factors would need to\nbe capable of taking a student’s chances from virtual certainty of rejection to virtual certainty of\nadmission. There is no such evidence as to any race-neutral factor, but there is repeated and\nconsistent evidence of such a treatment of race and ethnicity.\n\n       3. Achieving the Benefits of a Diverse Educational Environment\n\n       Even if I were not convinced that the Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” of minority\nstudents is a constitutionally invalid means to achieve diversity, I would still find the empirical link\nbetween such “critical mass” and the values of diversity lacking. 31 The Law School never provided\n\n\n       31\n          This discussion highlights the overlapping nature of the two-step equal protection analysis.\nOne might think that a discussion of the benefits of diversity would be better placed in the analysis\nof whether diversity in education is a compelling state interest. At this point, it is important to be\nprecise. No one, not even the Law School or Justice Powell, claims that diversity for its own sake\ncan constitute a compelling state interest. Instead, the claim is that diversity yields race-neutral\nbenefits that are themselves compelling. More precisely speaking, diversity in education is a means\nof achieving the compelling state interest in the benefits of diversity.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 86\n\n\nany evidence that the existence of the “critical mass” would in fact contribute to classroom dialogue\nor would lessen feelings of isolation or alienation. The only evidence at all bearing on this is from\nthe Gurin Report.\n\n        The Gurin report is questionable science, was created expressly for litigation, and its\nconclusions do not even support the Law School’s case. The benefits of a diverse student body that\nthe study purports to prove, essentially better learning32 and increased democratic participation,33 are\nthemselves vague to a degree that we would never accept to satisfy strict scrutiny in any other\ncontext. The concurring opinion34 contends that this opinion ignores the Gurin report in discussing\ndiversity’s capacity to deliver its claimed benefits. Concurring Op. at 29 (Clay). The concurring\nopinion, however, does not even mention, much less analyze, the strength of Gurin’s proof. The\n“study” suffers from profound empirical and methodological defects that lead me to doubt its\nprobative value. And certainly neither the trial court as finder of fact nor the majority opinion take\nthe report’s conclusions as fact.\n\n        First, the report falls well short of making the Law School’s case, even if we simply accept\nit without scrutinizing its conclusions. The report takes no position on how much diversity is\nrequired to yield the claimed benefits, and thus does not even purport to substantiate the Law\nSchool’s claim that a “critical mass” of minorities is required to achieve the educational benefits of\ndiversity.35\n\n\n       32\n          The report claims that the educational benefits that positively correlate with diversity\ninclude “graduate degree aspirations,” “drive to succeed,” and “academic ability.” Gurin also notes,\nin passing, that the favorable outcomes for African-American students, with which she reports a\ncorrelation to her diversity measures, do not include actual learning as measured by grade point\naverage. See JA at 2355; Patricia Gurin, The Compelling Need for Diversity in Higher Education,\n5 Mich. J. of Race and L. 363, 391 (1999).\n       33\n        The democratic benefits include “influencing social values,” “helping others in difficulty,”\nand “being involved in environmental activities.”\n       34\n         Although there are two concurring opinions in this case, only Judge Clay’s addresses the\nsubstantive portion of this dissent. My references in the text to the “Concurring Opinion” refer to\nJudge Clay’s. I will make a more specific reference when referring to Judge Moore’s concurring\nopinion.\n       35\n          The relationship between diversity and these assorted educational benefits could be\nproportional, exponential, or stepwise. If it were merely proportional, there would appear to be no\nbasis for the Law School’s attempts to achieve a “critical mass,” rather than each marginal “under-\nrepresented minority” bringing equal benefit.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 87\n\n\n       Second, the report’s aspirations to empiricism are undermined by the subjectivity of its data.\nAfter all, the report bases its claimed educational benefits on only the subjective self-reports of\nstudents.\n\n        Third and most importantly, the statistical regressions relied on by the report never examine\nthe statistical link between having a more diverse student body and the benefits that it claims.\nInstead, the regressions investigate only the correlation between the claimed benefits and two proxy\nvariables for diversity: “classroom diversity” and “informal interactional diversity.” See Gurin\nReport, JA at 2434, 2437, 2441, 2446. “Classroom diversity” is defined as the responding student\nhaving taken an ethnic studies class, and “informal interactional diversity” as a student having had\nsocial interaction with or about minorities in college. Ibid. Both of these variables, however, are\nindependent of having a more racially or ethnically diverse student body, and appear to make the\ncase for more ethnic studies classes or informational seminars about ethnic issues, instead of greater\nnumbers of minority students. In fact, one wonders why Gurin did not directly correlate her benefits\nto the much less complex, but infinitely more relevant, variable of participation in a more diverse\nstudent body: I fear that Gurin used the proxies because a study of mere student body diversity either\ndid not or would not produce the results that she sought.36 In any event, we lack any even\npurportedly empirical evidence demonstrating a correlation between increasing the number of under-\nrepresented minorities enrolled and the vague benefits of diversity claimed by the Law School.37\n\n\n       36\n          I am not alone in questioning the conclusions of the Gurin Report and the poverty of the\nempirical evidence presented. A social scientist and supporter of affirmative action in education\nevaluating some of the same data that Gurin used, but also examining actual student body diversity,\nconcluded that “academic outcomes are generally not affected” by student body diversity, and that\nthe effects that are indicated are “very weak and indirect.” Alexander W. Astin, WHAT MATTERS IN\nCOLLEGE ? 362 (Jossey-Bass 1993). As we might expect from the vague list of claimed benefits, this\nresearcher’s study concluded that “[t]he values, attitudes, and socioeconomic status of the peer group\nare much more important determinants of how the individual student will develop than are the peer\ngroup’s abilities, religious orientation, or racial composition.” Id. at 363. Accordingly, a candid and\nempirically rigorous affirmative action supporter has admitted that a link between racial diversity\nand improved educational results has “yet to be convincingly demonstrated” and that “[t]he research\nstill needs to be done that would demonstrate the link.” Peter Schmidt, Debating the Benefits of\nAffirmative Action, CHRON. OF HIGHER EDUC. A25 (May 18, 2001).\n       37\n         Even more fundamentally, social science data as to the efficacy, in the eyes of one or\nanother researcher, of policies of discrimination are themselves of limited utility in resolving the\nultimate constitutional issue. At the time of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),\nthere were certainly researchers with academic degrees who argued that segregated education would\nprovide greater educational benefits for both races. Does anyone think that a factual belief in such\nanalyses would have, or should have, led to a different constitutional outcome in Brown? I very\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 88\n\n\n         The Gurin Report aside, the link between the Law School’s diversity and its claimed benefits\nis conceptually flawed. The relationship between a “critical mass” and the values of diversity would\ndepend on contingencies nearly impossible to predict. The Law School’s definition seems to depend\nwholly on the psychological makeup of the people involved, whether labeled as majority or minority.\nCertainly history is replete with examples of members of minority groups, from Frederick Douglass\nto Martin Luther King to Thomas Sowell, who have said their piece and stood for what they believed\nin without regard to whether others thought them to be a “representative.” Eleanor Roosevelt is\nquoted as having said that “no one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” The same is\ntrue of representativeness. Apparently, by this measure, if and as members of the under-represented\ngroup become psychologically stronger, and thus more able or willing to speak as individuals, the\nLaw School needs less and less of them.\n\n         On the other hand, if the measurement is based on the attitudes of the “non-minority”\nstudents, there again is little concreteness to the measure. This would seem to mean that if those\noutside the minority groups were all paragons of tolerance, then there would be no need for any\npreference, because all students would uphold the precepts of the Constitution and major religions\nto treat each person as an individual. Conversely, if the majority student body stubbornly persisted\n(following the Law School’s lead) in attributing the experiences and opinions of their classmates to\ntheir racial identity, the critical mass would need to expand and expand, presumably until most or\nall of the recalcitrant majority students had been driven from campus. In short, any sort of rationale-\nbased definition of “critical mass” seems hopeless.\n\n        “Critical mass” also has difficulties if it is defined in a way divorced from some notion of\nthe “proper” representation of the particular group. Since the Law School gives no principles,\nsociological or otherwise, by which the “non-representativeness” of individual group members can\nbe judged, we would have to assume that a “critical mass” would be of approximately the same size\nfor any designated group. Thus, Afghans, Orthodox Jews, Appalachian Celts, or fundamentalist\nChristians might also feel that their remarks were being taken as representative, rather than\n\n\nstrongly doubt it. Similarly, research asserting that Jews and Gentiles in fact interacted more\nharmoniously under Lowell’s Harvard plan would not justify that policy either.\n        I note that this question is not simply of academic or antiquarian interest. Questions have\nbeen raised as to the ability or desirability of school districts implementing all-black academies in\norder to improve educational performance. See Wil Haygood, Rethinking Integration: On Schools,\nMany Blacks Return to Roots, BOSTON GLOBE (Nov. 16, 1997). I sincerely doubt that the factual\noutcome of conflicts between social scientists as to varying studies of the educational effect of such\npolicies would be dispositive of the constitutional question that might be raised. See Drew S. Days,\nIII, Brown Blues: Rethinking the Integrative Ideal, in REDEFINING EQUALITY (Neal Deavins and\nDavison M. Douglas, eds., Oxford 1998) (noting, while discussing the possibility of all-black public\neducational institutions, that “[e]xpedience cannot legitimize racial segregation”).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 89\n\n\nindividually, unless they, too, had a “critical mass.” Then, the makeup of the entering class could\nbe wholly determined by those groups that the Law School chose to classify as appropriate for\nworrying about their “under-represented status.” Indeed, the Law School does not appear to believe\nthat the critical mass for Native Americans, for example, is nearly as large as it is for blacks and\nHispanics. Thus, some measure of rough proportionality inevitably creeps in as the measure of what\nis the “critical mass.” Although the Law School’s deponents tried very hard to avoid any specificity\nin their responses (“A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow”), it was clear both in\nthe trial record and at oral argument that a number that was only half or less of a group’s\nrepresentation in some national measure of population would not be considered a “critical mass.”\n\n        Also problematic is how the Law School has selected the minorities entitled to a preference\nin terms of fostering a diverse educational environment. The Law School’s statement that its actions\nare justified because members of under-represented minorities are “particularly likely to have\nexperiences and perspectives of special importance” raises the question of whether it can determine\nthat other groups, such as Americans of Japanese or Welsh ancestry, are “particularly unlikely” to\nhave such experiences and perspectives. In practical effect, that is what the Law School has decided,\nand without any specific basis. Either the experiences and perspectives are themselves valuable, in\nwhich case they could be judged on that basis without reference to skin color or parentage, or the\nLaw School is assuming a heterogeneity among widely diversified groups.\n\n        4. Potential Race-Neutral Means\n\n        In order for its racial classifications to survive strict scrutiny, the state must first look to race-\nneutral means to achieve even compelling state interests. The Supreme Court has made clear that\ncourts must determine whether a state’s racial classification is necessary with reference to the\nefficacy of race-neutral alternatives. See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 507; United States v. Paradise,\n480 U.S. 149, 171 (1987); Associated Gen. Contractors of Ohio, Inc. v. Drabik, 214 F.3d 730, 736\n(6th Cir. 2000).\n\n        What is not crystal clear, however, is the nature of the consideration that reviewing courts\nmust undertake. Yet only one tack makes analytical sense. In order to prevail under strict scrutiny,\nthe state must demonstrate not only that its racial classification achieves compelling state benefits,\nbut also that these benefits may only be obtained by the shift from a well-designed, race-neutral\nalternative. Put differently, the state must demonstrate that the marginal benefits gained from\nemploying the racial classification over the next most efficacious race-neutral alternative are\nthemselves compelling. Any other standard would make success under strict scrutiny a mere exercise\nin question framing. The interest vindicated by a racial classification would look very large, perhaps\neven compelling, when compared to the benefits delivered by some dismal alternative. Instead, we\nshould require that before we find marginal benefits reflective of a compelling state interest, they\nmust be those gained over the best race-neutral alternatives.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 90\n\n\n        Consider some of the race-neutral alternatives available in this case. The gradient of benefits,\nalong which the race-conscious and race-neutral means are judged, is “academic diversity,” or\nachieving a pluralism of experiences and ideas. See Part III.A.1. Earlier in this opinion, I discussed\nthe possibility of considering experiential diversity in a race-neutral manner. Swamped with the\nchildren of wealthy suburbanites, the Law School could seek out applicants who were raised amidst\nrelative poverty, who attended under-funded or failing schools, who walked to school past\nwarehouses instead of coffeehouses, who experienced but conquered extreme emotional trauma, like\nthe loss of a parent, who prevailed over a profound childhood illness, who have dedicated years to\nhelping the poor in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, or, even less stirringly, who have a strong accounting\nbackground among a raft of history majors. If it really is a diversity of experiences and viewpoints\nthat the Law School seeks, why cannot the Law School just seek those experiences and viewpoints?\n\n          Instead, the Law School searches for particular races and ethnicities as a means of securing\na diversity of experience, and, so they say, for no other purpose. A well-functioning search for\nexperiential diversity would certainly yield the greatest measure of it. After all, even the Law School\nwould admit that race is an imperfect proxy for experiential diversity. Next-door neighbors in\nGrosse Pointe, separated only by 30 yards and the color of their skin, would not necessarily be\nsignificantly different from each other. In principle at least, the race-neutral means of seeking the\nexperiences themselves would seem superior to the Law School’s race-conscious means, if its aim\nis as it professes. This is quite the opposite of the woeful inadequacy of race-neutral means that we\ngenerally require to consider a racial classification narrowly tailored.\n\n        In practice, the Law School could make all sorts of arguments about the inadequacy of merely\nseeking experience. For example, admissions officers would have to read (and seriously consider)\nmore text in an application if it were seeking experience rather than race. The medium for\ncommunicating this quality, of course, lacks the efficient simplicity of the racial check-box. Yet,\nover and over again, the Law School has reassured us that its exquisitely meticulous admissions\nofficers already consider each application individually and thoroughly. Such is the luxury, the Law\nSchool tells us, of so few applications and spots to fill. I am willing to take the Law School at its\nword, and believe that it is fully capable of undertaking this searching review of individual\nexperience.\n\n         Also, a system seeking experiential diversity might increase the risk of applicant fraud. It\nmight be somewhat easier to verify that some individuals were truly of the right group than the\ndetails of their life stories. This comparative ease should not be overstated, however, as the\ndistinctions between the Law School’s “under-represented minorities,” from various types of\nHispanics to the marginally African-American, and the rest of society can be very subtle indeed. See\nPart III.B.2. Moreover, there are all sorts of readily identifiable indicia of experiential diversity.\nOne’s home mailing address gives quite a bit away. Law schools already ask for detailed financial\ninformation to make financial aid judgments, permitting a review of the relative poverty to which\nthe applicant was subjected. If the Law School were interested in the student’s secondary education,\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 91\n\n\nand the experiences that it imparted, it would not be outrageous to ask for a high school transcript.\nIndeed, as a good portion of the Law School’s student body hails from Michigan, see JA at 1947,\nthe Law School’s seasoned admissions officers could probably develop a pretty intimate\nunderstanding of the state’s high schools.\n\n         In short, the ready availability of seeking unique experiences themselves, rather than an\nimperfect proxy for them, demonstrates that the marginal benefits of the Law School using its\nsuspect racial preference instead of the available race-neutral means are far from compelling. In fact,\nbecause it seems to me that selecting on the basis of race is actually a more poorly calibrated means\nof achieving the experiential diversity that it allegedly seeks, I doubt that the Law School is really\ninterested in “academic diversity.” And this “academic diversity” is the only diversity that will\nsatisfy the Powell opinion that the majority considers outcome-determinative. Instead, it is more\nlikely that the Law School’s preference for certain races is an interest in race itself.\n\n        Another race-neutral alternative mentioned is conducting a lottery for all students above\ncertain threshold figures for their GPA and LSAT. This would insure a student body as diverse as\nthe “qualified” applicant pool itself. As demonstrated above, the Law School’s unwillingness to\nconduct a lottery among all those students that it considers “qualified” reveals that it really maintains\na two-track admissions system, one for the “highly-qualified” students of all races that it generally\nseeks, and another for under-represented minorities who are only “qualified.”38\n\n        The availability of such race-neutral means, especially in dealing with the manageably small\napplicant pool of the Law School, reveals that the Law School’s talk of desiring only “academic\ndiversity” is only window dressing for sheer racial discrimination.\n\n                                                  III\n\n         Many commentators have observed that America is still a society in which “race [as well as\nethnicity, religion and other ancestral characteristics] matters.” But we can not simply suspend the\nEqual Protection Clause until race no longer matters. Nor has the Supreme Court authorized us to\ndo so. One need not advocate literal “color-blindness,” where we neither notice nor appreciate the\ndiffering experiences and communities of others, to hold that our Constitution forbids the\ngovernment from assigning massive advantages and disadvantages based on a naked assignment of\nracial labels.\n\n\n        38\n          The concurring opinion suggests that evidence of racial and gender bias in LSAT and GPA\nfigures would render the lottery race-conscious. Concurring Op. at 42 (Clay). Of course, the lottery\nitself would be completely race-neutral. I do not see how using the Law School’s “qualification”\nthreshold, with which no party or judge has heretofore quarreled, to restrict the lottery would make\nthe lottery race-conscious.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 92\n\n\n        A significant amount of the analysis at pages 34-35 of the concurring opinion is directed to\nthe point that race continues to be a factor that operates in American society in many negative, as\nwell as positive, ways. I do not deny that. I am fully willing to stipulate that race does matter in\nAmerican society and that, on average, it matters more negatively for some, if not all, of the groups\nfavored by the Law School than it does for some, if not all, of the groups disfavored by the Law\nSchool. And I will also stipulate that such impact or disadvantage is not strictly limited by present\nincome or status. But a defense of the Law School’s policies on the basis of remediating generalized\npast discrimination has several problems.\n\n        First, the Supreme Court has firmly rejected the remediation of general “societal ills” and\npast discrimination as a justification for racial classifications. Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488\nU.S. 468, 498 (1989). Second, it is not the basis on which the Law School has stated that it operates,\nnor was the question litigated (except by intervenors), either at the trial level or the appellate level,\nor addressed in the majority opinion. More fundamentally, however, such an approach confuses\nsocietal ills, that may be addressed by societal means, with the rights of individuals. Julian Bond,\ncertainly a person who has been knowledgeable and engaged in this issue for decades, wrote in the\nGonzaga Law Review that policies like those in question here are the “just spoils of a righteous war.”\nJulian Bond, Lecture: A Call in Defense of Affirmative Action: Just Spoils of a Righteous War, 34\nGonz. L. Rev. 1, 9 (1998). The struggle for civil rights in America, going back well over a century,\ncan certainly be characterized as a righteous war. However, the earlier set of just spoils from a\nrighteous, actual war, the American Civil War, had two characteristics. First, they were enshrined\nby changing the charter of our society, through the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution. Second, the “spoils” embodied in those amendments were taken\nfrom slaveholders themselves, or from social and political structures in which the entire society (or\nthe entire majority society) paid the bill.\n\n        In this case, the “spoils” that are involved are the individual rights to equal treatment of real\npeople like Barbara Grutter. If, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, society chooses that “every drop\nof blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by another,”39 then that bill should be paid by the whole\nsociety, and by considered alteration of our Equal Protection Clause, not by ignoring it. Though the\nwar may be righteous, such spoils taken from the Barbara Grutters of our society are not just.40\n\n\n        39\n             Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865.\n        40\n         The concurring opinion responds that, in a world without affirmative action, applicants like\nGrutter will not be much better off. Concurring Op. at 36-38 (Clay). To make its point, the\nconcurring opinion quotes at length the opinion, interlaced with some statistics, set forth in a recent\nWashington Post column. See Goodwin Liu, The Myth and Math of Affirmative Action, WASH . POST\nB1 (April 14, 2002). The concurring opinion asserts, on the basis of this evidence, that Athe idea that\nan admissions policy does so at the expense of white applicants is simply a myth.@ Concurring Op.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 93\n\n\n        It can hardly be doubted that, on average, those students who are admitted to Michigan Law\nSchool despite the policies in question will have been more favorably situated, economically and\nsocially, than those such as the plaintiff whose chances of admission have been reduced or\neliminated by those policies.\n\n        Similarly, because academic credentials are significantly correlated with parental income,\nsocial status, and education,41 the malign effects of discriminatory policies like the Law School’s will\n\n\nat 36.\n         The Liu analysis simply does not support the concurring opinion=s conclusion. First, the\narticle explicitly states that its argument applies just as forcefully to Alan Bakke. But the Supreme\nCourt certainly did not deny Bakke’s claim because he could not prove with mathematical certainty\nthat he would have received one of the sixteen places improperly segregated from the general\napplicant pool.\n         Second, the article gives the game away when it candidly states that its statistical conclusion\n“occurs in any selection process in which the applicants who do not benefit from affirmative action\ngreatly outnumber those who do.” Liu, supra, at B1; Concurring Op. at 15 (emphasis added).\n         It is true that there is a very real sense in which the wrong committed against a person\nabsolutely barred from consideration for a governmental benefit is greater than the wrong committed\nagainst a person only deprived of a fair chance of consideration.\n         But a wrong has still been committed. The concurring opinion and Liu may not characterize\nthat wrong as a “substantial disadvantage,” ibid., but the deprivation of equal consideration is a\nwrong to which the Constitution is opposed.\n         There may have been hundreds of Jews each year who were denied a fair chance for\nconsideration by the Harvard quota plan, even though a far smaller number of actual seats were\ninvolved and most such applicants could not have been certain of admission. They would not have\nbeen comforted by the force of Liu’s arguments.\n         To say that it is a matter of less importance that ten people are each deprived of a one-tenth\nchance of admission because of race than if one person is completely excluded from admission is\nto ignore both mathematics and our system of deciding cases and controversies. If Grutter’s rights\nhave been violated, the degree of the violation and the proper remedy are matters for the district\ncourt to determine in the first instance. To say that Grutter’s claims are to be ignored because the\nwhole system that she has challenged has a relatively small discriminatory impact or because the\nmagnitude of the violation as to her is small is to say that she has no rights that this court is bound\nto respect. I decline to take that attitude.\n         41\n        See, e.g., R. Richard Banks, Meritocratic Values and Racial Outcomes: Defending Class-\nBased College Admissions, 79 N.C.L. Rev. 1029, 1062 (2001) (noting that “[a] variety of studies\nhave demonstrated positive relationships between early academic achievement and parental income,\neducation, and occupation.”); Tomiko Brown-Nagin, \"Broad Ownership\" of the Public Schools: An\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 94\n\n\nrarely fall upon the children of the educators who craft them or the judges who rule upon them. The\nstatistical region where those policies really bite, and where people like Barbara Grutter are excluded\nfrom equal consideration based on their race, are areas likely to be more heavily populated by\npersons whose income, ethnicity, social standing, and religious preferences are not those of the\nacademic, legislative, and judicial decision-makers who support those policies. Thus Michigan’s\npolicy can not be seen simply as a good-hearted effort by one group to forego opportunities for itself\nfor the greater good.\n\n        Michigan’s plan does not seek diversity for education’s sake. It seeks racial numbers for the\nsake of the comfort that those abstract numbers may bring. It does so at the expense of the real rights\nof real people to fair consideration. It is a long road from Heman Sweatt to Barbara Grutter. But\nthey both ended up outside a door that a government’s use of racial considerations denied them a fair\nchance to enter. I therefore respectfully dissent from the court’s legitimation of this unconstitutional\npolicy.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the \"T-Formation\" Process Model for Achieving Educational Adequacy and Its\nImplications for Contemporary School Reform Efforts, 27 J.L. & Educ. 343, 385 (1998) (noting that\n“comparative indicia showing the relationship between socioeconomic background and academic\nperformance continues to reveal a persistent gap in achievement between wealthier and poorer\nstudents”).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v.

Since a person reading these opinions in sequential order will have read a variety of complicated\nresponses attempting to defend what happened procedurally in this case, it may be well to begin with\nthe plainest possible statement of undisputed primary facts. The panel that considered this case prior\nto, and certainly following, the filing of the present appeals was not constituted in conformity with\n6th Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(2) of this court’s rules, or any other rule. A motion that counsel made on\nMay 14, 2001, for initial hearing en banc was not transmitted to most members of the court for five\nmonths, and was not treated as stated in the court’s order of June 4, 2001. These facts speak for\nthemselves, however each of us may choose to characterize them.\n\n        The appeals regarding the Law School’s admissions program that we have today decided\nwere filed as follows: case number 01-1447 on April 2, 2001, and case number 01-1516 on April\n18, 2001.\n\n       Under this court’s rules, these cases generally would have been assigned to a panel chosen\nat random. See 6th Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(1). This was not done. Instead, as a result of a series of\ndecisions in contravention of our rules and policies, we arrived at the present configuration.\n\n        In August 1999, a panel of this court, consisting of Circuit Judges Daughtrey and Moore and\nvisiting Senior District Judge Stafford, in case number 98-2009, decided an appeal concerning the\nrights of certain parties to intervene in the district court case underlying the current appeal, but did\nnot address the merits of the case. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394 (6th Cir. 1999).\n\n        Upon the filing of the instant appeals, a question could have arisen regarding whether these\nappeals, seeking review of cases already returned to the district court by a panel of this court, were\n“must panel” cases. See 6th Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(2). It is absolutely clear that the applicable procedures\nfor potential “must panel” cases were not followed to determine whether and how these cases should\nbe heard as a “must panel.”\n\n         If a panel has “returned a case to the district court for further proceedings” and another\nappeal has been taken from those further proceedings, the original panel “determine[s] whether the\nsecond appeal should be submitted to it for decision, or assigned to a panel at random.” Ibid. If a\ndistrict judge, as in this case, was on the original panel, the remaining two circuit judges from the\noriginal panel are required to decide whether the district judge should be recalled for the panel or\nwhether a third circuit judge “should be drawn to fill out the panel; provided that, if oral argument\nis scheduled, the draw shall be made from the judges of this Court scheduled to sit at that time.” Ibid.\nThese procedures were not followed in this case.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 96\n\n\n       While these cases were before the district court, several interlocutory motions were, in the\nusual course of our policies, referred to a weekly motions panel chosen at random. However, even\nthough no second appeal had been filed, the motions were then redirected to the earlier panel, which\nhad been augmented, at the direction of the Chief Judge, by the addition of the Chief Judge, not a\nrandomly chosen judge.42 Following the filing of the current appeals, all further actions regarding\nthose appeals, including a motion to stay the district court’s order, were handled by this preselected\npanel.\n\n        This was the situation when, on May 14, 2001, counsel petitioned the entire court, pursuant\nto Fed. R. App. P. 35(b)(1)(B), asking that the cases be heard by the en banc court in the first\ninstance. At this point, the en banc court consisted of eleven active judges: the nine judges who\nultimately heard this case plus then-active Judges Norris and Suhrheinrich. The petition was not\ncirculated to the entire court.\n\n        Instead, on June 4, 2001, an order was issued, at the direction of the Chief Judge and in the\nname of the court, stating that the motion “c[ame] before the court,” but holding the petition for\nhearing en banc in abeyance “until such time as the briefs of the parties have been filed, after which\nthe court will make a determination on whether the cases should be submitted to a three-judge panel\nfor adjudication or be referred to the en banc court.” (emphasis added). This order was also not\ncirculated to the en banc court. The Appellee’s proof brief was filed on June 18, 2001.43 The\npetition was still not circulated to the court. On July 1, Judge Norris took senior status. All briefing\nin the case was certainly completed by July 30, 2001. Even still, the petition was not circulated to\nthe court. On August 15, Judge Suhrheinrich took senior status.44 The petition was still not\n\n\n       42\n         It is not clear that preliminary motions can be redirected from a randomly selected motions\npanel to a purported “must panel” when no appeal has been filed.\n       43\n          Petitions for initial hearing en banc were filed in nine cases in the year 2000. Two of the\ncases, both filed pro se, were disposed of without circulating the en banc petition to the court. See\nDocket Sheets in Naturalite v. Ciarlo, No. 00-2106, decided under Rule 34, 22 Fed. Appx. 506\n(2001) and in Griffin v. Warren, No. 00-4552 (petition for certificate of appealability denied).\n        In each of the other seven cases, the petition for initial hearing en banc was circulated to the\ncourt no later than two days after the appellee’s proof brief was filed. All were disposed of by the\nfull court before the final briefs were filed.\n       44\n         The question of the circumstances under which Judge Norris and/or Judge Suhrheinrich\ncould have sat on a potential en banc court hearing the case could be a matter of some contention.\nUnder the circuit rule in place at the time, “any judge who had been in regular active service at the\ntime a poll was requested on the petition” for an en banc hearing would be a member of the en banc\ncourt hearing the case. 6th Cir. I.O.P. 35(a) (1998) (emphasis added). As Judge Gilman discussed\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 97\n\n\ncirculated to the court. On August 23, 2001, according to our internal docket, the petition was\n“referred” to the specially constituted panel. I have no reason to doubt that Judges Moore and\nDaughtrey had not known of the petition prior to that time. The special panel still did not circulate\nthe petition for an en banc hearing to the full court.45\n\n        Rather than circulating the still pending petition, the special panel scheduled the case for oral\nargument before itself, and again not a normally selected panel. According to the order, issued\nAugust 27, oral argument was to be held on October 23, fifty-seven days away. Forty-nine of those\nfifty-seven days passed, with no action being taken to circulate the still pending petition for hearing\n\n\nin his separate opinion in Popovich v. Cuyahoga Cty. Ct. of Common Pleas, 276 F.3d 808, 829 (6th\nCir. 2002) (en banc), there is a substantial question regarding whether our rule in effect at the time\nwas consistent with 28 U.S.C. § 46(c), governing the composition of courts of appeals en banc.\nNevertheless, that was the rule we followed until October 31, 2001. We subsequently changed our\nrule to compose the en banc court of all judges in regular active service “at the time of oral argument\nen banc.” 6th Cir. I.O.P. 35(a) (2002).\n         The old rule would have governed all the relevant en banc court composition issues that I\nhave raised here. From Popovich, we know that this court’s precedent is, at least by permitting\nJudge Merritt to sit in that case, that our old Policy 35(a) is not statutorily invalid. Thus, both Judges\nNorris and Suhrheinrich could have sat on the en banc court if the petition had been circulated\nearlier. Judge Norris would have been a part of the en banc court in this case if a vote on the petition\nhad been requested by July 1, over 45 days after the petition had been filed. Judge Suhrheinrich\nwould have been a part of the court if a vote had been requested by August 15, over 90 days after the\npetition was filed and more than 15 days after the completion of briefing. The specially constituted\npanel’s withholding the petition from the court until October 15, 2001, 150 days after it had been\nfiled and 75 days after the completion of briefing, had the effect of potentially keeping both judges\noff an en banc court.\n        45\n          Judge Moore’s reference to a December 5, 2000 policy imposed by the Chief Judge omits\nseveral important features of the policy. See Concurring Op. at 23-24. First, the policy states that\nit was prompted by petitions for initial hearing en banc from “pro se litigants, mainly prisoners,” not\nfrom counsel in important cases. It specifically states that it does not apply if the Chief Judge and\nclerk agree that “it is an unusual case.” I think we can all agree that this case was unusually\nimportant. Second, the policy authorized two and only two actions by the hearing panel to which\nthe case and the petition is referred. The panel could either “deny the petition” and schedule the case\nfor argument before the panel or “send the petition out to the en banc court.” Neither occurred here.\nThe policy never authorized the panel to schedule argument and not to decide the petition. Third,\nthe policy directed the panel to circulate the petition to the en banc court if it saw “some legitimate\nargument for hearing en banc.” It strains credulity to argue now, after the petition has been granted,\nthat the petition contained no “legitimate argument” for its granting.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 98\n\n\nen banc, even though all briefing certainly had been completed. Suddenly, with the panel hearing\njust eight days away, a decision was made finally to circulate the pending petition to the nine active\njudges of our court.46 The petition was circulated without any explanation for the delay, and without\neven any notation that a delay had occurred. In addition, the statement accompanying the circulation\nneither recommended an en banc hearing nor indicated why the issue was raised, at that time, as\nopposed to a time more proximate to the filing of the petition, though it did state that the full court\nwas being advised because “a question . . . has been raised regarding the composition of the panel.”47\nIn any event, sufficient members of the active court voted to have the case heard en banc, and an\norder was issued on October 19, 2001, canceling the panel hearing scheduled to occur in only four\ndays and instituting an en banc hearing before the now-reduced court.48\n\n        Judge Moore’s concurrence makes several remarkable points. She first notes that the irregular\nconstitution of the panel can be excused because “Chief Judge Martin has frequently substituted\nhimself in a variety of matters, of varying degrees of importance, throughout his tenure as chief\njudge, in order to avoid inconveniencing other circuit judges.” Concurring Op. at 26 (Moore). But,\nof course, the very point is that such a practice, to the extent it exists, was unknown to the other\nmembers of the court, who had every reason to believe that the panel had been regularly constituted.\n\n\n       46\n          In early October, one senior judge of our court became concerned about the procedures that\nhad been followed in this case, namely the specially constituted panel that had taken over this case.\nAfter that judge made several unsuccessful efforts to speak with the Chief Judge, on October 15 he\nfaxed to the Chief Judge a letter setting forth his concerns as to whether court rules and policies had\nbeen followed in this case. He received no response or any other communication regarding this letter\n(and has not, to this day). However, on the same day that he sent that letter, with the hearing only\neight days away, a decision was made to circulate the petition for an en banc hearing.\n       47\n          Judge Clay’s concurring opinion suggests that I “question[] the appropriateness of hearing\nthis case en banc” and then argues why hearing important cases en banc is good. Concurring Op.\nat 43, 44. I have no opinion on the substance of the decision to hear this case en banc, only the\nprocedures used to dictate its timing.\n       48\n         There is precedent for the special administration of a high-profile case. In Mozert v.\nHawkins Cty. Bd. of Educ., 827 F.2d 1058 (6th Cir. 1987), then-Chief Judge Lively took the case out\nof the normal hearing schedule because of educational time constraints and its importance. Rather\nthan personally constituting a special panel, the Chief Judge, after suggesting the procedure to all\nthe active judges on the court, had the clerk conduct a random draw of circuit judges to constitute\nthe panel. Pursuant to the drawing, the Chief Judge, as a matter of coincidence, was randomly\nselected. This process occurred in a matter of days, and never threatened to delay the case. If such\na transparent process had been followed here, the procedural issues noted in this appendix probably\nwould not have arisen.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 99\n\n\nThere was no reason to know of the unusual handling of the motions in 2000. There was no reason\nto know that there was any relation between the constitution of the “must panel” in 2001 and the\nactivities in 2000. And there was no reason to know that anything was going on that was not in strict\nconformity with 6th Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(2). Thus, there was no reason to take any unusual action in\nresponse, whether before or after “April 5, 2001.” Concurring Op. at 27.\n\n        Judge Moore also contends that the Chief Judge regularly fills “vacancies in other cases,” that\nno one has previously objected to his practice, and that his practice has become “a matter of common\nknowledge among the judges of this court.” Concurring Op. at 26. I absolutely deny that this judge\nhas had any “knowledge” of, or that the Chief Judge has announced or admitted to, any such practice\nof inserting himself onto panels without a random draw.\n\n        The notion that other members of the court were in some way derelict in not sua sponte\ncalling for an initial hearing en banc as soon as the appeal was filed is both remarkable and misses\nthe point. Concurring Op. at 25-26, 27. There would be no particular reason for an initial hearing\nen banc unless there were some extraordinary circumstance, as the document Judge Moore has\nquoted obliquely indicates. Concurring Op. at 24-25.\n\n        I have been on the court for 16 years, and I do not recall an initial hearing en banc in my\ntenure. The concatenation of the irregular panel, the withholding, by whatever mechanism, of the\nmotion addressed to the court, and the later granting of that motion in haste, are matters for which\nthe other members of the court are certainly not responsible.\n\n         Judge Moore suggests that my objections to the composition of the three-judge panel are\n“minor” because the decisions regarding the composition did not “actually change[] the outcome of\nthe present case.” Concurring Op. at 24 n.5 (Moore). But as I have always made clear, it is difficult\nto know what body would have decided this case if the rules had been correctly implemented.\nFurther, to the extent that the Judge Moore claims that the irregularities in the hearing panel’s\ncomposition were the only reason for granting the en banc petition, those irregularities existed at the\ntime the petition was filed, and thus it is difficult also to argue that they did not affect the\ncomposition of the panel that ultimately decided this case. Most importantly, however, the rights\nof litigants and the members of this court to scrupulous compliance with the rules are not dependent\non the likely – or even certain – substantive outcomes of particular matters before the court.\n\n        Contrary to Judge Moore’s concurring opinion, I do not contend that the legal opinions of\nany member of this court do not represent that judge’s principled judgment in this case. Concurring\nOp. at 21-22 (Moore). However, under these circumstances, it is impossible to say what the result\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 100\n\n\nwould have been had this case been handled in accordance with our long-established rules. The case\nmight have been heard before a different panel, or before a different en banc court.49\n\n\n\n\n       49\n           Neither of the concurring opinions addressing this appendix disputes any of the factual\ncircumstances described.\n        Judge Clay argues that no negative conclusions regarding any member of this court can be\ndrawn from the handling of this case. Concurring Op. at 44 (Clay). I draw no such conclusions in\nthis appendix. It may be possible that each of these events occurred without conscious direction.\nEach reader can make an independent judgment from the apparently undisputed facts that I have laid\nout here. Frankly, I would have been most pleased if my statement of apparent facts had been proven\nwrong. Unfortunately, that has not occurred.\n        Judge Moore correctly states that our “only source of democratic legitimacy is the perception\nthat we engage in principled decision-making.” Concurring Op. at 22 (Moore). If actions are taken\nthat may imperil that legitimacy, a member of this court who observes them is left with two\nalternatives, both unpalatable. One is to allow the actions to pass in silence, even after explanations\nhave been requested, but have not been produced. Silence simply allows those actions to continue\nand to be repeated, with real consequences for both the court and the litigants who appear before it.\n        The other alternative is to place the actions on the record, for such remediation as may be\npossible.\n        I have not revealed the substance of any internal communications on this case between\nmembers of our court, with the exception of the letter of one senior judge who asked me to do so.\nSee n.46 supra. Compare Concurring Op. at 43 & 34 n.3 (Clay); Concurring Op. at 27 (Moore). As\nto Judge Clay’s discussion of my opinion in Memphis Planned Parenthood v. Sundquist, 184 F.3d\n600, 605-07 (6th Cir. 1999) (Boggs, concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc), Concurring Op.\nat 43-44 (Clay), I will leave to the candid reader to consider the distinction between laying out very\nsignificant and obvious violations of rights of members of this court, and revealing, in contravention\nof long-honored custom, the internal votes of members of this court.\n        Legitimacy protected only by our silence is fleeting. If any damage has been done to the\ncourt, it is the work of the actors, not the reporters.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v.

I write separately to say that I concur in all of that dissent, including the exposition\nof the procedural history of the case. In her separate concurrence, Judge Moore expresses her belief\nthat by revealing that history, Judge Boggs—and I, by concurring—undermine the legitimacy of the\ncourt and do harm to ourselves, this court and the nation. I believe that exactly the opposite is true.\nPublic confidence in this court or any other is premised on the certainty that the court follows the\nrules in every case, regardless of the question that a particular case presents.

Both the majority opinion and Judge\nBoggs’s dissent address the two key issues in this case: (1) whether diversity in higher education,\nincluding racial and ethnic diversity, is a compelling government interest, and (2) whether the\nUniversity of Michigan Law School’s admissions policy is narrowly tailored to further that goal.\nThere is much to be said for each viewpoint, but there are aspects of both opinions with which I do\nnot agree. The majority opinion, in particular, reaches what I believe to be an erroneous conclusion\nregarding the narrow-tailoring challenge to the Law School’s admissions policy. Judge Boggs’s\ndissent, on the other hand, includes arguments in support of his position that the Law School’s\nadmissions policy is not narrowly tailored that I find troublesome. Specifically, I am unpersuaded\nby his critique that no empirical link exists between a critical mass of minority students and the\nperceived educational benefits or his belief that race-neutral factors would be more likely to achieve\nthe desired diversity of experience than reliance on an applicant’s race. I therefore feel compelled\nto write a separate dissenting opinion.\n\n        The facts of the present case, in my opinion, eliminate the need to decide whether or not this\ncourt is bound by Justice Powell’s conclusion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,\n438 U.S. 265 (1978), that educational diversity is a compelling government interest. Indeed, the\nprincipled disagreement between the majority opinion and Judge Boggs’s dissent as to the proper\nresolution of this issue underscores the confusion created by the various opinions in Bakke. No one\ndisputes, however, that Bakke stands for the proposition that an admissions policy designed to further\nthe interest of educational diversity is not narrowly tailored if it creates a two-track system for\nevaluating prospective students, where minorities are effectively insulated from competition with\nother applicants. Id. at 319-20 (holding that the University of California’s admissions system, which\nreserved a fixed number of places specifically for minority students, violated the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment).\n\n        The Law School’s admissions policy, in my view, creates such an impermissible system. I\ntherefore believe that this court should assume, without deciding, that educational diversity—as\ndefined by Justice Powell in Bakke—is a compelling government interest. Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Prot. Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 445 (1988) (“A fundamental and longstanding principle of\njudicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the\nnecessity of deciding them.”). Several of our sister circuits have taken a similar approach. Johnson\nv. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Georgia, 263 F.3d 1234, 1251 (11th Cir. 2001) (assuming that\neducational diversity is a compelling interest, but holding that the school’s admissions policy was\nnot narrowly tailored); Tuttle v. Arlington County Sch. Bd., 195 F.3d 698, 705 (4th Cir. 1999) (per\ncuriam) (same); Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790, 796 (1st Cir. 1998) (same).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 104\n\n\n       The primary problem with the Law School’s admissions policy is that the “critical mass” of\nminority students that it seeks to enroll is functionally indistinguishable from a quota. Whether\nviewed as a percentage or as an absolute number, the consistency in the minority student enrollment\ndemonstrates that the Law School has for all practical purposes set aside a certain number of seats\nfor minority students. See Judge Boggs’s discussion in Part II.B.2. of his dissent. The “critical\nmass” therefore appears to be a euphemism for the quota system that Bakke explicitly prohibits.\n\n        I believe that the Law School’s pursuit of a critical mass of minority students has led to the\ncreation of a two-track admissions system, not only in the sense that a minimum percentage of seats\nis set aside for under-represented minorities, but also because the Law School gives grossly\ndisproportionate weight to race and ethnicity in order to achieve this critical mass. Judge Boggs’s\ndiscussion of the vastly divergent admissions rates for minority students as compared to all other\napplicants to the Law School, a divergence that cannot be ascribed to any factor other than their race\nor ethnicity, demonstrates this reality. In my view, Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke unequivocally\nprohibits such a de facto dual admission system that applies one standard for minorities and another\nfor all other students. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317 (indicating approval of Harvard’s admissions plan,\nwhere “race or ethnic background may be deemed a ‘plus’ in a particular applicant’s file, yet it does\nnot insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats”).\n\n       Moreover, like Judge Boggs, I believe that the record establishes that race-neutral factors are\nnowhere near as significant in determining admissions as whether the applicant is an under-\nrepresented minority. The Law School’s policy of achieving a critical mass of minority students\nwithout giving comparable consideration to other aspects of diversity is irreconcilable with Justice\nPowell’s explanation of why a quota system represents an impermissible use of race in the\nadmissions process:\n\n       In a most fundamental sense the argument misconceives the nature of the state\n       interest that would justify consideration of race or ethnic background. It is not an\n       interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body\n       is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, with the remaining\n       percentage an undifferentiated aggregation of students. The diversity that furthers\n       a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and\n       characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important\n       element. Petitioner’s special admission program, focused solely on ethnic diversity,\n       would hinder rather than further attainment of genuine diversity.\n\nId. at 315 (Powell, J.) (emphasis omitted). In my view, this compels the conclusion that the Law\nSchool’s admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to serve the presumptively compelling\ngovernment interest in a diverse student body. Simply put, an applicant’s race or ethnicity, even if\nnot the only factor (other than LSAT scores and GPAs) that is taken into account, receives such\ngrossly disproportionate weight as to violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 105\n\n\n        The Law School, as the preceding discussion suggests, attempts to equate attaining a “critical\nmass” of minority students with the goal of achieving a diverse student body. But because the Law\nSchool’s goal of achieving a critical mass results in a two-track system that is functionally equivalent\nto a quota, its admissions policy is prohibited by Bakke. This is a quandry that admits of no easy\nsolution.\n\n        Is there any way, then, that race or ethnicity can ever be taken into account in a narrowly\ntailored manner that would survive strict scrutiny? Surely the answer is “Yes.” For example, in\ndifferentiating between two applicants with essentially equal LSAT scores and GPAs, where one is\nCaucasian and the other African-American, I have little doubt that favoring the under-represented\nAfrican-American applicant would pass constitutional muster if educational diversity is recognized\nas a compelling government interest. This would clearly fall within the scope of what I believe\nJustice Powell had in mind when discussing the appropriate use of a “plus” for diversity in Bakke.\n\n         The problem, according to the Law School, is that limiting the conscious favoritism of\nminorities to situations where the factor is a “plus among equals” would not likely produce the\ncritical mass that it earnestly believes is essential to achieve a truly diverse student body. On the\nother hand, such an admissions policy would presumably avoid the animosities stirred up by the\ncommon perception that admitted minority students are less qualified than their nonminority peers.\nSee Bakke, 438 U.S. at 298 (Powell, J.) (“[P]referential programs may only reinforce common\nstereotypes holding that certain groups are unable to achieve success without special protection based\non a factor having no relationship to individual worth.”) (citing DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312,\n343 (1974) (Douglass, J., dissenting)).\n\n        But these competing considerations are matters that need not, and cannot, be resolved by the\ncase before us. Based on the record presented, I am convinced that the Law School’s admissions\npolicy that results in a de facto quota in favor of minority students is far closer to the rigid set-aside\nsquarely prohibited by Bakke than it is to the “plus among equals” that I believe would be clearly\nconstitutional. How close the Law School would have to come to the latter end of the spectrum in\norder for its admissions policy to survive the strict-scrutiny test should, in my opinion, await another\nday, a day when a more narrowly tailored policy is formulated and presented for resolution. In the\nmeantime, I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

On appeal, the Law School is joined by the Intervenors: forty-one individuals and\nthree student groups, United for Equality and Affirmative Action, the Coalition to Defend\nAffirmative Action By Any Means Necessary, and Law Students for Affirmative Action. The\nIntervenors offer an additional justification for the Law School’s consideration of race and ethnicity\n– remedying past discrimination. Barbara Grutter, an unsuccessful applicant to the Law School, on\nbehalf of herself and others similarly situated, urges us to affirm the district court’s decision. For\nthe reasons set forth below, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court.2\n\n                                                   I.\n\n        The Law School drafted its admissions policy to comply with the Supreme Court’s opinion\nin Bakke. Adopted by the full faculty in 1992, the policy states that the Law School’s “goal is to\nadmit a group of students who individually and collectively are among the most capable students\napplying to American law schools in a given year.” It further provides that the Law School “seek[s]\na mix of students with varying backgrounds and experiences who will respect and learn from each\nother.” As part of the Law School’s policy of evaluating each applicant individually, its officials read\neach application and factor all of the accompanying information into their decision.\n\n        In identifying applicants who can be expected to succeed academically, the Law School\nevaluates a composite of the applicant’s Law School Admissions Test and undergraduate grade-point\naverage. This composite can be visualized as a grid with standardized test scores on the horizontal\naxis and grade-point average on the vertical axis. Every combination of standardized test score and\nundergraduate grade-point average is shown in a cell on this grid. Each cell reports the number of\napplicants with that particular combination of numerical qualifications, as well as the number of\noffers of admission made to the applicants in that cell. Constructed in this manner, the highest\ncombination of test scores and undergraduate grade-point averages are found in the grid’s upper\nright-hand corner. Thus, an applicant’s chance of being admitted generally increases as he or she\n\n\n       1\n        Until recently, Lee Bollinger was the president of the University of Michigan. Prior to his\npresidency, he was dean of the Law School. His successor as dean was Jeffrey Lehman. Dennis\nShields was the director of the Law School’s admission program until 1998.\n       2\n        Our decision only pertains to the case involving the Law School. We will address the\nchallenge to the University of Michigan’s admissions policy, Gratz v. Bollinger, Nos. 01-1333, 01-\n1416, 01-1418, 01-1438, in a forthcoming opinion.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 4\n\n\nmoves into the grid’s upper right-hand corner. There is no combination of grades and test scores,\nhowever, below which an applicant will automatically be denied admission, or above which\nadmission is guaranteed.\n\n\n\n        The Law School also considers “soft” variables like the enthusiasm of the recommenders,\nthe quality of the undergraduate institution, the quality of the applicant’s essay, residency, leadership\nand work experience, unique talents or interests, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course\nselection. After taking these additional “soft” variables into account, the Law School sometimes\nadmits students with relatively low index scores. Its admissions policy describes two general\nvarieties of students who may be admitted with such scores – (1) “students for whom [there is] good\nreason to be skeptical of an index score based prediction” (e.g., a student with a track record of poor\nstandardized test performance, but who has an outstanding academic record) and (2) students who\n“may help achieve that diversity which has the potential to enrich everyone’s education and thus\nmake a law school class stronger than the sum of its parts.”\n\n        The Law School’s admissions policy explains that “[t]here are many possible bases for\ndiversity admissions.” For example, the policy states that particular weight might be given to “an\nOlympic gold medal, a Ph.D. in physics, the attainment of age 50 in a class that otherwise lacked\nanyone over 30, or the experience of having been a Vietnamese boat person.” The policy also offers\nthree examples of actual diversity admissions. One student was born in Bangladesh, graduated from\nHarvard with a 2.67 grade-point average, received “outstanding references” from his professors, had\nan “exceptional record of extracurricular activity,” and had Law School Admission Test scores at\nthe 46th percentile and 52nd percentile. Another was an Argentinian single mother with extensive\nbusiness experience, who graduated summa cum laude from the University of Cincinnati, who was\nfluent in four languages, and scored at the 52nd percentile on the Law School Admission Test. The\nthird applicant had a 3.99 grade-point average from the University of Florida, a Law School\nAdmission Test score at the 90th percentile, and as the daughter of Greek immigrants was “immersed\nin a significantly ethnic home life,” and fluent in three languages.\n\n        Reflecting the Law School’s goal of enrolling a diverse class, its admissions policy describes\n“a commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from\ngroups which have been historically discriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and\nNative Americans, who without this commitment might not be represented in our student body in\nmeaningful numbers.” Students from such racial and ethnic groups “are particularly likely to have\nexperiences and perspectives of special importance to our mission.” Professor Richard Lempert, the\nchair of the faculty committee that drafted the admissions policy, explained that the Law School’s\ncommitment to such diversity was not intended as a remedy for past discrimination, but as a means\nof including students who may bring a different perspective to the Law School.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 5\n\n\n         In considering race and ethnicity, the Law School does not set aside or reserve seats for\nunder-represented minority students. As Dean Jeffrey Lehman testified: “We do not have a portion\nof the class that is set aside for a critical mass of under-represented minority students.” This\ntestimony was echoed by Dennis Shields, the Law School’s former admissions director, and Erica\nMunzel, the current director of admissions, both of whom testified that the Law School does not\nstrive to admit a particular percentage of under-represented minority students. The Law School does,\nhowever, consider the number of under-represented minority students, and ultimately seeks to enroll\na meaningful number, or a “critical mass,” of under-represented minority students. According to\nDirector Munzel, “critical mass” is a number sufficient to enable under-represented minority students\nto contribute to classroom dialogue without feeling isolated. Similarly, Dean Lehman equated\n“critical mass” with sufficient numbers to ensure under-represented minority students do not feel\nisolated or like spokespersons for their race, and do not feel uncomfortable discussing issues freely\nbased on their personal experiences. Professor Lempert and Kent Syverud, the current dean of\nVanderbilt Law School and a former Michigan Law School professor, offered similar definitions of\n“critical mass.” The Law School’s witnesses also testified that “critical mass” was not a set number\nor percentage. Director Munzel stated that there is no number or percentage, or range of numbers\nor percentages, that constitute a “critical mass.” Likewise, Dean Lehman stated that “critical mass”\ncould not be fixed in terms of number or percentage.\n\n        Both the Law School and the unsuccessful applicants presented expert testimony regarding\nthe Law School’s use of race in admissions decisions. Analyzing grids of the Law School’s\nadmissions data from 1995-2000, the unsuccessful applicants’ statistical expert testified that the\nrelative odds of acceptance for Native American, African-American, Mexican-American and Puerto\nRican applicants were many times greater than for Caucasian applicants and concluded that members\nof these groups were “given an extremely large allowance for admission.”\n\n        According to the Law School’s statistical expert, eliminating race as a factor in the\nadmissions process would dramatically lower minority admissions. He predicted, for example, that\nif the Law School could not consider race, under-represented minority students would have\nconstituted only 4% of the entering class in 2000, instead of the actual enrollment figure of 14.5%.\nCiting the experience of the University of California at Berkeley after the passage of Proposition 209,\nDean Lehman echoed these predictions, testifying that he feared under-represented minority\nenrollment would drop to “token” levels if race and ethnicity could not be considered.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       This Court reviews de novo the district court’s finding that the Law School’s efforts to\nachieve a diverse student body through the consideration of race and ethnic origin is unconstitutional\nand violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In Bakke, a fragmented Court determined that the Medical School of\nthe University of California at Davis, which justified its race-conscious admissions program, in part,\nas necessary to achieve a diverse student body, could not be permanently enjoined from considering\nits applicants’ race because “the State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by\na properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic\norigin.” Id. at 320.\n\n        Two distinct opinions support Bakke’s judgment on this issue: Justice Powell’s opinion\nannouncing the judgment of the Court, id. at 269-324, and Justice Brennan’s opinion concurring in\nthe judgment in part and dissenting in part, in which Justices White, Marshall, and Blackmun joined,\nid. at 324-79.\n\n         Applying intermediate scrutiny, the Brennan concurrence found Davis could constitutionally\njustify its consideration of race as an effort to remedy the effects of societal discrimination. Id. at\n362. Applying strict scrutiny, Justice Powell found “the attainment of a diverse student body . . .\nclearly is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education.” Id. at 311-312.\n\n        Justice Powell recognized that a diverse student body promotes an atmosphere of\n“speculation, experiment and creation” that is “essential to the quality of higher education.” Id. at\n312 (quoting Sweezy v. New Hampshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105533\"><a href=\"/opinion/105533/sweezy-v-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105533\"><a href=\"/opinion/105533/sweezy-v-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, he noted that, by enriching students’ education with a\nvariety of perspectives, experiences, and ideas, a university with a diverse student body helps equip\nits students to be productive members of society. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 313 (“[I]t is not too much to\nsay that the ‘nation’s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure’ to the ideas and\nmores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.”) (quoting Keyishian v.

Accordingly, he concluded “the\ninterest of diversity is compelling in the context of a university’s admission program.” Id. at 314.\n\n\n\n       3\n        Because Title VI, which prohibits racial discrimination in programs receiving federal funds,\nproscribes only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause, this court\nneed only address whether the Law School’s admissions program is constitutional.

In contrast to Justices Black and\nDouglas in Memoirs, the Brennan concurrence did not assert that Davis’s admissions program was\nwholly insulated from review. In fact, the Brennan concurrence agreed with Justice Powell that\nDavis’s admissions program was subject to heightened scrutiny, see Bakke, 438 U.S. at 359\n(advocating intermediate scrutiny); it expressly disagreed only with his application of strict scrutiny.\nBecause Bakke is, if anything, more susceptible to the Marks analysis than the case examined in\nMarks itself, we find the district court erred in failing to analyze Bakke under Marks.\n\n        The Bakke Court addressed the permissibility of racial classifications in academic admissions\nprograms. Under the Brennan concurrence’s rationale, the more permissive intermediate scrutiny\nstandard would apply to “benign” racial classifications. Id. Under Justice Powell’s rationale, strict\nscrutiny would apply to all racial classifications. Id. at 304-07. Because the set of constitutionally\npermissible racial classifications under intermediate scrutiny by definition includes those\nclassifications constitutionally permissible under strict scrutiny, Justice Powell’s rationale would\npermit the most limited consideration of race; therefore, it is Bakke’s narrowest rationale.\nAccordingly, Justice Powell’s opinion constitutes Bakke’s holding and provides the governing\nstandard here.6 See Marks, 430 U.S. at 193-94; see also Triplett Grille, Inc. v.

Under the Harvard plan, Harvard\nCollege justified its race-conscious admissions policy solely on the basis of its efforts to achieve a\ndiverse student body. See id. at 316. Harvard’s consideration of race could not be constitutional if\nit did not further a constitutionally permissible goal; therefore, by indicating that the Harvard plan\ncould be constitutional under its approach, the Brennan concurrence implicitly – but unequivocally\n\n\nopinions on the specific subject of student body diversity is that diversity is [only] an ‘important’\ninterest,” because application of an “important interest” rationale to Bakke’s facts would produce a\njudgment contrary to that actually reached by the Bakke Court. If student body diversity were only\nan “important” interest, Justice Powell could not join in the Court’s decision to permit “the\ncompetitive consideration of race and ethnicity” because a plan serving a merely important interest\nwould not survive strict scrutiny.\n         Moreover, under Marks, this court must follow the reasoning of the concurring opinion with\nthe narrowest line of reasoning on the issue of why the California Supreme Court could not\npermanently enjoin Davis from considering race, not – as the dissent suggests – the narrowest line\nof reasoning capable of being gleaned from a conglomeration of the opinions.

See Hopwood\nv.

Because the Supreme Court alone retains the ability to overrule its decisions, we\nreject the district court’s conclusion.\n\n         In Bakke, the Supreme Court determined that Davis – an institution that did not purport to\njustify its race-conscious admissions program as necessary to remedy specific past discrimination\n– could consider its applicants’ race. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320. Thus, if the only constitutionally\npermissible reason to consider race is remedying specific past discrimination, Bakke’s judgment is\nno longer good law. In other words, adopting the district court’s conclusion that the Law School\ncould only justify race-conscious admissions decisions as a remedy for specific past discrimination\nwould necessitate a finding that the Supreme Court has implicitly overruled Bakke.\n\n        The Supreme Court, however, has explicitly prohibited just such a finding.

Davis operated a dual-track admissions system featuring a separate\nadmissions committee and separate review process for minority applicants. Id. at 273-74. Davis also\nestablished a quota for minority students – for example, in 1974, Davis reserved sixteen spots for\nminority applicants. Id. at 275. According to Justice Powell, the critical defect in Davis’s program\nwas that non-minority students were “totally excluded from a specific percentage of seats in an\nentering class.” Id. at 319.\n\n        As an example of a constitutionally permissible admissions plan, Justice Powell advanced\nthe Harvard plan in which race or ethnicity was deemed a “plus,” but did not insulate a minority\napplicant from comparison with other applicants. Id. at 316. Under the Harvard plan, an institution\ncould consider the race and ethnicity of applicants, but race and ethnicity alone were not the\nexclusive components of academic diversity. Id. at 317. Thus, a black applicant could be “examined\nfor his potential contribution to diversity without the factor of race being decisive when compared,\nfor example, with . . . an Italian-American if the latter is thought to exhibit qualities more likely to\npromote beneficial educational pluralism.” Id. According to Justice Powell, such qualities included\n“exceptional personal talents, unique work or service experience, leadership potential, maturity,\ndemonstrated compassion, a history of overcoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the\npoor, or other qualifications deemed important.” Id. The Harvard plan was “flexible enough to\nconsider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant,\nand to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them\nthe same weight.” Id. Race could “tip the balance” in an applicant’s favor, but so could other factors\nlike “geographic origin or a life spent on a farm.” Id. at 316.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 14\n\n\n        Above all, the Harvard plan “treat[ed] each applicant as an individual in the admissions\nprocess.” Id. at 318. “The applicant who loses out on the last available seat to another candidate\nreceiving a ‘plus’ on the basis of ethnic background will not have been foreclosed from all\nconsideration for that seat simply because he was not the right color or had the wrong surname.” Id.\nRather, his denied admission “would mean only that his combined qualifications, which may have\nincluded similar nonobjective factors, did not outweigh those of the other applicant.” Id.\n\n        In endorsing the Harvard plan, Justice Powell accepted that a university could not provide\n“a truly heterogen[e]ous environment . . . without some attention to numbers.” Id. at 323. As the\nHarvard plan detailed:\n\n       10 or 20 black students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each other\n       the variety of points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United\n       States. Their small numbers might also create a sense of isolation among the black\n       students themselves and thus make it more difficult for them to develop and achieve\n       their potential. Consequently, when making its decisions, the Committee on\n       Admissions is aware that there is some relationship between numbers and achieving\n       the benefits to be derived from a diverse student body, and between numbers and\n       providing a reasonable environment for those students admitted. But that awareness\n       does not mean that the Committee sets a minimum number of blacks or of people\n       from west of the Mississippi who are to be admitted. It means only that in choosing\n       among thousands of applicants who are not only ‘admissible’ academically but have\n       other strong qualities, the Committee, with a number of criteria in mind, pays some\n       attention to distribution among many types and categories of students.\n\nId. at 323-24.\n\n        Justice Powell rejected Justice Brennan’s contention that the distinction between a quota and\na program that considered race and ethnicity as a potential “plus” was largely illusory. In Justice\nPowell’s view, a “plus” program – unlike a quota – lacked a “facial intent to discriminate.” Id. at\n318. Emphasizing that the fine distinction between a “plus” and quota system was both discernible\nand constitutionally significant, Justice Powell recalled Justice Frankfurter’s declaration that “‘[a]\nboundary line is none the worse for being narrow.’” Id.

Bollinger\nPage 15\n\n\n       In summary, Justice Powell’s opinion sets forth two guidelines regarding race-conscious\nadmissions policies – (1) segregated, dual-track admissions systems utilizing quotas for under-\nrepresented minorities are unconstitutional; and (2) an admissions policy modeled on the Harvard\nplan, where race and ethnicity are considered a “plus,” does not offend the Equal Protection Clause.\nNeither party questions the applicability of Justice Powell’s opinion regarding the narrowly tailored\ncomponent of strict scrutiny, and it is our view that whether the Law School’s admissions policy\npasses constitutional muster turns on Justice Powell’s opinion.9\n\n                                                   1.\n\n        Drafted to comply with Bakke, the Law School’s consideration of race and ethnicity does not\nuse quotas and closely tracks the Harvard plan. Race and ethnicity, along with a range of other\nfactors, are potential “plus” factors in a particular applicant’s file, but they do not insulate an under-\nrepresented minority applicant from competition or act to foreclose competition from non-minority\napplicants. As part of its policy of evaluating each applicant individually, the Law School’s officials\nread each application and factor all of the accompanying information into their decision. The Law\nSchool, like Harvard, attends to the numbers and distribution of under-represented minority\napplicants in an effort to ensure all of its students obtain the benefits of an academically diverse\nstudent body.\n\n         The record demonstrates that the Law School does not employ a quota for under-represented\nminority students. The Law School’s witnesses, including the current and former admissions\ndirectors, all testified that the Law School does not reserve or set aside seats. For example, Dean\nLehman testified: “We do not have a portion of the class that is set aside for a critical mass of under-\nrepresented minority students.” Moreover, the Law School operates a single admissions system;\nthere is no separate track for minority applicants insulating them from comparison with non-minority\napplicants. Thus, the Law School’s admissions policy avoids the critical defect of the Davis\nadmissions program.\n\n       The Law School’s competitive consideration of the race and ethnicity of African-Americans,\nHispanics and Native Americans closely tracks the Harvard plan. In its admission policy, quoted in\nBakke, Harvard details that race is a “factor in some admissions decisions” and that “the race of an\napplicant may tip the balance in his favor just as geographic origin or a life spent on a farm may tip\n\n\n        9\n        We recognize that the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Justice Powell’s endorsement of the\nHarvard plan as dicta. See Johnson, 263 F.3d at 1261. Even if this portion of Justice Powell’s\nopinion could be labeled dicta, it is nevertheless dicta from the determinative opinion in the only\nSupreme Court case to address the consideration of race and ethnicity in academic admissions.\nAccordingly, Justice Powell’s endorsement of the Harvard plan carries considerable persuasive\nauthority and provides a more appropriate basis for our opinion than any test we might fashion.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 16\n\n\nthe balance in other candidates’ cases.” Id. at 316. Explaining the rationale behind this policy,\nHarvard highlighted that a “black student can usually bring something [to Harvard] that a white\nperson cannot offer.” Id. The Law School considers an applicant’s race and ethnicity as a potential\n“plus” factor, or as Professor Lempert testified, as one element among other elements. Because race\nand ethnicity are a “plus,” they undoubtedly “tip the balance” in some applicants’ favor. Importantly,\nhowever, the Law School’s consideration of race and ethnicity does not operate to insulate any\nprospective student from competition with any other applicants. The Law School’s explanation for\nits consideration of race and ethnicity also mirrors the Harvard plan. According to the Law School,\nstudents from these groups “are particularly likely to have experiences and perspectives of special\nimportance to [the Law School’s] mission.”\n\n         In seeking an academically diverse class, the record indicates that the Law School considers\nmore than an applicant’s race and ethnicity. In Bakke, Justice Powell stressed factors in addition to\nrace and ethnicity that could contribute to academic diversity. See id. at 317. He cited “exceptional\npersonal talents, unique work or service experience, leadership potential, maturity, demonstrated\ncompassion, a history of overcoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the poor, or other\nqualifications deemed important.” Id. Mirroring Justice Powell’s discussion, the Law School’s\nadmissions policy states that “[t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions” and that in\nevaluating “soft” variables, it considers a range of factors such as leadership, work experience,\nunique talents or interests and the enthusiasm of an applicant’s letters of recommendation.\nIllustrating this range, the policy provides that particular weight might be given to “an Olympic gold\nmedal, a Ph. D in physics, the attainment of age 50 in a class that otherwise lacked anyone over 30,\nor the experience of having been a Vietnamese boat person.”\n\n         The Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” of under-represented minority students also\ntracks the Harvard plan’s pursuit of a class with meaningful numbers of minority students.\nExplaining its attention to the numbers and distribution of minority students, Harvard emphasized\nthat “10 or 20 black students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each other the variety\nof points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United States.” Id. at 323.\nMoreover, “[t]heir small numbers might also create a sense of isolation among the black students\nthemselves and thus make it more difficult for them to develop and achieve their potential.” Id. In\ndefining the term “critical mass,” the Law School’s witnesses voiced virtually identical concerns.\nDirector Munzel testified that “critical mass” is a number sufficient so that under-represented\nminority students can contribute to classroom dialogue and not feel isolated. Dean Lehman similarly\nequated “critical mass” with sufficient numbers to ensure under-represented minority students do\nnot feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race, and feel comfortable discussing issues freely\nbased on their personal experiences. Professor Lempert and Kent Syverud, the current dean of\nVanderbilt Law School and a former Michigan Law School professor, offered similar explanations\nfor the Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” of under-represented minority students. Essentially,\nboth the Law School’s admission policy and the Harvard plan attend to the numbers of under-\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 17\n\n\nrepresented minority students to ensure that all students – minority and majority alike – will be able\nto enjoy the educational benefits of an academically diverse student body.\n\n        In light of the foregoing, we find that the Law School’s consideration of race and ethnicity\nis virtually indistinguishable from the Harvard plan Justice Powell approved in Bakke.\n\n                                                  2.\n\n        The unsuccessful applicants focus principally on the effects of the Law School’s policy,\ncontending first that the Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” is the functional equivalent of a\nquota because it has resulted in a range of under-represented minority enrollment from 10%-17%.\nAs a matter of definition, we are satisfied that the Law School’s “critical mass” is not the equivalent\nof a quota, because unlike Davis’s reservation of sixteen spots for minority candidates, the Law\nSchool has no fixed goal or target. That the Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” has resulted\nin an approximate range of under-represented minority enrollment does not transform “critical mass”\ninto a quota. Because Bakke allows institutions of higher education to pay some attention to the\nnumbers and distribution of under-represented minority students, see id. at 316-17, over time,\nreliance on Bakke will always produce some percentage range of minority enrollment. And that\nrange will always have a bottom, which, of course, can be labeled the “minimum.” These results are\nthe logical consequence of reliance on Bakke and establishment of an admissions policy, like the\nHarvard plan, that attends to the numbers and distribution of under-represented minority students.\nAs such, they cannot serve as the basis for a charge that the Law School’s admissions policy is\nunconstitutional.\n\n         In analyzing actual admissions data, the dissent tries out a variation of the unsuccessful\napplicants’ contention and focuses only on the years 1995 through 1998. Dissenting Op. at 75\n(Boggs, J.). Based on this grouping, the tightest four-year range available, the dissent concludes that\nthe Law School seeks a “critical mass” of forty-four to forty-seven under-represented minorities per\nclass, or “around 13.5%.” But as the dissent confesses in a footnote, the rest of the picture\n“deviate[s] a bit.” Id. at 75 n.29. From 1987 to 1994, under-represented minority enrollment was\n12.3%, 13.6%, 14.3%, 13.4%, 19.1%, 19.8%, 14.5%, 20.1%, respectively. More importantly for\npresent purposes, if we examine under-represented minority enrollment from 1993 until 1998, we\nsee that the Law School’s under-represented minority enrollment ranged from 13.5% to 20.1%. In\nlight of (1) the overwhelming testimony by Law School professors, admissions counselors and deans\nthat the Law School does not employ a quota or otherwise reserve seats for under-represented\nminority applicants and (2) Justice Powell’s instruction that lower courts presume that academic\ninstitutions act in good faith in operating their “plus” programs, we simply cannot conclude that the\nLaw School is using the “functional equivalent” of the Davis Medical School quota struck down in\nBakke.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 18\n\n\n        Relying on statistical evidence that under-represented minority students are admitted to the\nLaw School with comparatively lower undergraduate grade-point averages and standardized test\nscores, the unsuccessful applicants also argue that the Law School considers race and ethnicity too\nmuch.10 Although they concede that all admitted students are qualified, the unsuccessful applicants\ncontend that this disparity evidences an unconstitutional double standard for admission of under-\nrepresented minority applicants and non-minority applicants. Upon inspection, however, the\nunsuccessful applicants’ statistical evidence demonstrates just what one would expect a plan like the\nHarvard plan to demonstrate – that race and ethnicity, as “plus” factors, play an important role in\nsome admissions decisions. As the logical result of reliance on the Harvard plan, the unsuccessful\napplicants’ statistical evidence accordingly cannot sustain their contention that the Law School’s\nadmissions policy is unconstitutional.\n\n        In advancing the Harvard plan, Justice Powell, unfortunately, did not define or discuss a\npermissible “plus” with respect to the test scores and high school grades of under-represented\nminority Harvard applicants. And Harvard did not append a statistical comparison of minority and\nnon-minority standardized test scores and/or grades to its admissions plan. Perhaps Harvard, in\nenrolling meaningful numbers of under-represented minority students, could select under-represented\nminority applicants with test scores or high school grades equivalent to their non-minority\ncounterparts. And then again, perhaps Harvard grappled with some of the same admissions\nchallenges as the Law School does today. Of course, such admissions statistics are neither in the\nrecord before us nor explicitly incorporated into Justice Powell’s opinion. Under these\ncircumstances, we cannot hold that the Law School’s admissions program, which is virtually\nidentical to the Harvard plan, would nevertheless fail Justice Powell’s test for constitutionality.\nWithout some indication that Justice Powell specifically meant to limit the consideration of race or\nethnicity – as a “plus,” to “tip the balance,” or as a “factor in some admissions decisions” – to\ninstances where standardized test scores or high school grade-point averages were equivalent, we\ncannot adopt the limited definition of “plus” urged by the dissenting opinions. See Dissenting Op.\nat 71-73 (Boggs, J.); Dissenting Op. at 93 (Gilman, J.). And thus, we cannot conclude that the\ndifference, on average, between the standardized test scores and/or undergraduate grades of qualified\nunder-represented minority students and qualified non-minority students renders the Law School’s\nadmissions policy unconstitutional.\n\n                                                  3.\n\n        The district court relied on five factors in concluding that the Law School’s consideration of\nrace and ethnicity was not narrowly tailored: (1) the Law School did not define “critical mass” with\nsufficient clarity; (2) the apparent lack of a time limit on the Law School’s consideration of race and\n\n\n       10\n           The district court credited plaintiffs’ statistical conclusions, but did not incorporate them\ninto its discussion of whether the Law School’s admission policy was sufficiently narrowly tailored.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 19\n\n\nethnicity; (3) the admissions policy was “practically indistinguishable” from a quota system; (4) the\nLaw School did not have a logical basis for considering the race and ethnicity of African-Americans,\nNative Americans and Puerto Ricans; (5) the Law School did not “investigate alternative means for\nincreasing minority enrollment.” Grutter, 137 F. Supp. 2d at 850-52. As a initial matter, we have\nserious reservations regarding the district court’s consideration of five factors not found in Bakke,\nwhich, as we have stated, is the only Supreme Court case to directly address the consideration of race\nand ethnicity in academic admissions. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the remaining factors relied\non by the district court cannot sustain its holding.\n\n        Although not addressed in Bakke, subsequent Supreme Court opinions suggest consideration\nof race-neutral means is necessary to satisfy the narrowly tailored component of strict scrutiny.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987)). Although the Law School’s\nconsideration of race and ethnicity differs from the racial classifications at issue in Croson, and the\ncontext of higher education differs materially from the government contracting context, see, e.g.,\nHopwood, 78 F.3d at 965 n.21 (Wiener, J., concurring) (“This unique context, first identified by\nJustice Powell, differs from the employment context, differs from the minority business set aside\ncontext, and differs from the re-districting context; it comprises only the public education context\nand implicates the uneasy marriage of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.”), we nevertheless\nassess whether the Law School adequately considered race-neutral alternatives.\n\n         The district court acknowledged that the Law School introduced evidence indicating that\nunder-represented minority students could not be enrolled in significant numbers without explicit\nconsideration of race and ethnicity, but ruled that the Law School “fail[ed] to investigate alternative\nmeans for increasing minority enrollment.” 137 F. Supp. 2d at 852. Upon examination, however,\nthe record does indicate the Law School considered and ultimately rejected various race-neutral\nalternatives to the consideration of race and ethnicity. Director Munzel, former Director Shields and\nDean Lehman all testified that the Law School engaged in both pre- and post- admission recruiting\nactivities but that such activities were not enough to enroll a “critical mass” of under-represented\nminority students. Additionally, Professor Lempert testified regarding the lottery system, in which\nthe Law School would lower its admissions standards, establish a numerical cut-off for “qualified”\napplicants, and then select randomly from among those applicants. According to Professor Lempert,\nsuch a system would admit greater numbers of non-minority students, but would not yield\nmeaningful racial and ethnic diversity. Given the Law School’s consideration of race-neutral\nalternatives and the evidence that “under-represented minority students cannot be enrolled in\nsignificant numbers unless their race is explicitly considered in the admissions process,” we find that\nthe Law School has adequately considered race-neutral alternatives.\n\n       The dissent proposes the Law School pursue “experiential diversity in a race-neutral manner”\nand characterizes such an approach as a superior alternative to the Law School’s current admissions\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 20\n\n\nsystem. Dissenting Op. at 80-81 (Boggs, J.). In effect, then, the dissent proposes that the Law\nSchool only focus on its race-neutral bases of diversity admissions. But as the dissent essentially\nacknowledges, this proposed alternative could not possibly achieve the same robust academic\ndiversity currently sought and obtained by the Law School. The dissent says that it is “fully willing\nto stipulate that race does matter in American society, and that, on average, it matters more\nnegatively for some, if not all, of the groups favored by the Law School than it does for some, if not\nall disfavored by the Law School.” Id. at 82. As to the impact of income, the dissent also offers to\n“stipulate that such impact or disadvantage is not strictly limited by present income or status.” Id.\nYet the dissent nevertheless proposes that the Law School ignore the influence of race and ethnicity\nin pursuing a broad “pluralism of ideas and experiences” and, at the same time, reassures us that the\npursuit of race-neutral diversity will still somehow produce the broadest “pluralism of ideas and\nexperiences.” Id. at 81. In reality, by reducing the range of experiences the Law School can consider\n- namely, the experience of being an African-American, Hispanic or Native American in a society\nwhere race matters - the dissent proposes only a narrowed and inferior version of the academic\ndiversity currently sought by the Law School.\n\n         Lastly, we note that we do not read Bakke and the Supreme Court’s subsequent decisions to\nrequire the Law School to choose between meaningful racial and ethnic diversity and academic\nselectivity. An institution of higher education must consider race-neutral alternatives, but it need\nnot abandon its academic mission to achieve absolute racial and ethnic neutrality. Thus, in applying\nstrict scrutiny we cannot ignore the educational judgment and expertise of the Law School’s faculty\nand admissions personnel regarding the efficacy of race-neutral alternatives. We are ill-equipped\nto ascertain which race-neutral alternatives merit which degree of consideration or which alternatives\nwill allow an institution such as the Law School to assemble both a highly qualified and richly\ndiverse academic class.

Mindful of both our constitutional obligations and our practical\nlimitations, we also assume – along the lines suggested by Justice Powell – that the Law School acts\nin good faith in exercising its educational judgment and expertise. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 318-19.\n\n                                                  4.\n\n        We are not persuaded by the remaining factors that the district court relied on to invalidate\nthe Law School’s admissions policy. First, the district court’s conclusion that the term “critical\nmass” is not sufficiently defined is at odds with the extensive record in this case, and the district\ncourt’s own characterization of “critical mass” as the functional equivalent of a quota. See Grutter,\n137 F. Supp. 2d at 850. Numerous law school witnesses testified regarding the meaning of the term\n“critical mass.” For example, Dean Lehman equated “critical mass” with sufficient numbers such\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 21\n\n\nthat under-represented minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race, and\ndo not feel uncomfortable discussing issues freely based on their personal experiences. We also\nemphasize the considerable tension between the district court’s findings that “critical mass” is both\ninsufficiently defined and the functional equivalent of a quota. In any event, the district court’s\napparent insistence that “critical mass” correspond with a more definite percentage is also fatally at\nodds with Bakke’s prohibition of fixed quotas. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 319.\n\n        Second, the district court’s statement that “there is no logical basis for the law school to have\nchosen the particular groups which receive special attention under the admissions policy,” Grutter,\n137 F. Supp. 2d at 851-52, ignores both the Harvard plan and the Law School’s admissions policy.\nThe Harvard plan specifically identified “blacks and Chicanos and other minority students” among\nthe under-represented groups that Harvard sought to enroll through its admissions policy. Bakke,\n438 U.S. at 322. The Law School’s similar reference to African-Americans, Hispanics and Native\nAmericans accordingly cannot be faulted in this respect. Moreover, the policy itself supplies the\nlogical basis for considering the race and ethnicity of these groups – without such consideration, they\nwould probably not be represented in the Law School’s student body in “meaningful numbers.” As\nwith the formulation and consideration of race-neutral alternatives, some degree of deference must\nbe accorded to the educational judgment of the Law School in its determination of which groups to\ntarget. See Ewing, 474 U.S. at 226.\n\n         Finally, the district court’s determination that the Law School’s consideration of race and\nethnicity lacks a definite stopping point also does not render the admissions policy unconstitutional.\nSee Grutter, 131 F. Supp. 2d at 851. Although the district court correctly recited Adarand’s directive\nthat a race-conscious remedial program must be limited so that it “will not last longer than the\ndiscriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate,” this directive does not neatly transfer to an\ninstitution of higher education’s non-remedial consideration of race and ethnicity. Unlike a remedial\ninterest, an interest in academic diversity does not have a self-contained stopping point. Indeed, an\ninterest in academic diversity exists independently of a race-conscious admissions policy.\nNevertheless, even if we were to apply a durational constraint, we are satisfied that the Law School’s\nadmissions policy sets appropriate limits on the competitive consideration of race and ethnicity. The\nrecord indicates that the Law School intends to consider race and ethnicity to achieve a diverse and\nrobust student body only until it becomes possible to enroll a “critical mass” of under-represented\nminority students through race-neutral means. Thus, we are satisfied that the admissions policy is\n“sensit[ive] to the possibility that [it] might someday have satisfied its purpose.” See Associated Gen.\nContractors of Ohio, Inc. v.

I write separately both to note my\ndisapproval of Judge Boggs’s decision to include a “Procedural Appendix” as part of his dissenting\nopinion and to provide an accurate account of how this case came to be argued before the present\nen banc court.\n\n                                                     I.\n\n        In publishing their “Procedural Appendix,” I believe that Judge Boggs and those joining his\nopinion have done a grave harm not only to themselves, but to this court and even to the Nation as\na whole. A court’s opinions state the reasons for its holdings and provide the public with the\nprincipled justifications for them. Dissenting opinions typically present principled disagreements\nwith the majority’s holding. Such disagreements over principle are perfectly legitimate and do not\nundermine public confidence in our ability as judges to do what we have sworn to do because, as a\nculture, we have long recognized that disagreements over principle are unavoidable. Given this\ncultural backdrop, disagreements over principle can be phrased in strong terms without damaging\nthe court’s ability to function as a decision-making institution in a democratic society. Judges\ncriticize their colleagues’ reasoning all the time, and, if they are to carry out their oaths of office, they\nmust do so. This robust exchange of ideas sharpens the focus and improves our analysis of the legal\nissues.\n\n       In the present case, Judge Boggs has written a lengthy and strongly worded critique of the\nsubstance of the majority’s holding in the present case. Although I disagree with his analysis and\nconclusions, I acknowledge his abilities as a jurist.\n\n         The final section of Judge Boggs’s dissent, labeled “Procedural Appendix,” however,\npublicizes disagreements over the internal workings of the court, which, as my colleague states, “do\nnot directly affect the legal principles discussed in this case.” Given that these procedural matters\nare, at best, peripheral to the matter at hand, the only reason that “it is important that they be placed\nin the record” is to declare publicly the dissent’s unfounded assertion that the majority’s decision\ntoday is the result of political maneuvering and manipulation. The baseless argument of the\n“Procedural Appendix” is that the decisions of this court are not grounded in principle and reasoned\nargument, but in power,1 and that the judges of this court manipulate and ignore the rules in order\n\n\n        1\n      Judge Boggs responds in his dissent that he does “not contend that the legal opinions of any\nmember of this court do not represent that judge’s principled judgment in this case.” Dissenting Op.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 24\n\n\nto advance political agendas. I am saddened that Judge Boggs and those joining his opinion believe\nthese things. But, more importantly, I am concerned that my dissenting colleagues’ actions will\nseverely undermine public confidence in this court. Cf. Memphis Planned Parenthood, Inc. v.\nSundquist, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765271\"><a href=\"/opinion/765271/memphis-planned-parenthood-inc-v-don-sundquist-governor-of-the-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608 (6th Cir. 1999) (Batchelder, J., separate statement on denial of\nrehearing en banc) (“Our dissenting colleague’s own purposes may be furthered by publicly\nimpugning the integrity of his colleagues. Collegiality, cooperation and the court’s decision-making\nprocess clearly are not. And public confidence in the judicial system and in this court clearly are\nnot.”).\n\n        Because we judges are unelected and serve during good behavior, our only source of\ndemocratic legitimacy is the perception that we engage in principled decision-making. See Planned\nParenthood v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112786\"><a href=\"/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 865-66 (1992). This perception is based both in the reality of\nour practice — I believe that my colleagues, all of them, strive to decide cases in a principled manner\n— and in the presentation of our decisions to the public in written opinions.\n\n        The decisions of this court are not self-executing but instead must be carried into practice by\nother actors. They will do so only as long as they regard us as legitimate, as we possess neither the\npurse nor the sword, but only judgment. For this reason, we are often described as the weakest\nbranch, but a court without purse, sword, or legitimacy would be weaker still. This is not to argue\nthat protecting the relative strength of the judicial branch should be our primary concern. Indeed,\nwe have all sworn to uphold the Constitution, and the Nation needs a strong judiciary to check the\noccasional excesses of the other branches and, more importantly, to preserve the rule of law.\n\n       Our ability to perform these crucial tasks is imperiled when members of this court take it\nupon themselves to “expose to public view” disagreements over procedure. The damage done by\nsuch exposés is, at least in part, the responsibility of those who report them, despite the efforts of\nJudge Boggs and those joining his opinion to disclaim responsibility for their own conduct. It is\nunderstandable, however, that they do so, as their conduct in the present case is nothing short of\nshameful.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       With great reluctance, I find myself forced to respond to Judge Boggs’s inaccurate and\nmisleading account of the procedural facts underlying the present case.2 As discussed in Part I of\n\n\n\nat 89. He does contend, however, that the result in the present case represents unprincipled\nprocedural maneuvering by members of this court. It is this contention to which I object.\n       2\n       This response is truly a recourse of last resort, as several members of this court have\nendeavored to persuade Judge Boggs to withdraw the “Procedural Appendix.” He has steadfastly\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 25\n\n\nthis opinion, I firmly believe that matters of internal court procedure should not be exposed to public\nview. But when one is attacked in the way that the members of the majority have been attacked, it\nis necessary to present an accurate account of the events in question; to fail to do so would create the\nimpression that Judge Boggs’s assertions are, in fact, correct.\n\n        Judge Boggs and those joining his opinion have numerous complaints regarding the\nprocedures that were followed in the present case. In the end, however, their chief complaint is that\nthe present case has been decided by a nine-judge en banc court (“the particular decision-making\nbody that has . . . decided [the case]”) rather than an eleven-judge en banc court, and that the\nmembers of the hearing panel originally assigned this case (Chief Judge Martin, Judge Daughtrey,\nand myself) purposefully engineered this result. A number of Judge Boggs’s unfounded assertions\ninvolve the May 14, 2001 petition for initial en banc hearing filed by Barbara Grutter. Judge Boggs\nrepeatedly asserts that the “preselected” hearing panel withheld this petition from the other members\nof the court until after Judges Norris and Suhrheinrich took senior status, on July 1 and August 15,\n2001, respectively.\n\n        The Sixth Circuit’s private docket, however, indicates that the May 14 petition for hearing\nen banc was first referred to the hearing panel on August 23, 2001, and it was not received by the\npanel until several days thereafter.3 By August 23, both Judges Norris and Suhrheinrich had taken\nsenior status. Even if the hearing panel had taken immediate action to circulate the en banc petition\nto the whole court on that date, the case would have been heard by the same en banc court that in fact\nheard it on December 6, 2001. The record simply does not support any other conclusion on this\npoint. Similarly, the June 4, 2001 order holding the en banc petition in abeyance was also referred\nto the hearing panel in August 2001. Thus, Judge Boggs’s claim that the June 4 order was not\ncirculated to the en banc court, on June 4, is true, as far as it goes, but misleading, because that order\nwas not circulated to any judges at that time, including the hearing panel. This ministerial order was\nsigned by the clerk of the court and was not issued as a result of any action by the hearing panel.\n\n       In addition, Judge Boggs’s assertion that the hearing panel violated the rules or internal\noperating procedures of the Sixth Circuit in not circulating the en banc petition to the entire court\n\n\n\n\nrefused to do so. The three members of the hearing panel have also personally assured Judge Boggs\nthat we did not engage in the manipulation of which he has accused us, but he has refused to accept\nour assurances.\n        3\n        My own records indicate that I first saw the May 14, 2001 petition on September 26, 2001,\nat which time I consulted with the other members of the hearing panel about circulating the petition\nto the whole court.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 26\n\n\nafter August 23 but prior to October 15, 2001, is simply incorrect.4 On December 5, 2000, months\nbefore the filing of the petition in the present case, Chief Judge Martin instituted a policy regarding\nthe treatment of petitions for initial hearing en banc. This change in policy was spurred by the\nincreasing frequency of such petitions, especially in pro se appeals. In the letter detailing the policy,\nthe chief judge instructed that, when such a petition is filed, the clerk of the court should enter an\norder, such as that issued in the present case, holding the petition in abeyance until the completion\nof briefing, and then refer the petition to the hearing panel assigned the cases. This procedure was\nfollowed in the present case. In each case, the assigned hearing panel would then decide, as an initial\nmatter, whether to deny the petition and proceed with the scheduled panel consideration or, if the\npetition raised a legitimate ground for initial hearing en banc, to circulate the petition to the rest of\nthe court. To my knowledge, no one raised any objection to this policy when it was circulated to the\ncourt for comment and instituted in December 2000. Pursuant to this policy, the hearing panel in\nthe present case decided, in September 2001, not to circulate the en banc petition to the entire court.\nWhatever the prior practice of the Sixth Circuit with respect to the circulation of petitions for initial\nhearing en banc, see Dissenting Op. at 86 n.43 (discussing petitions filed in the year 2000), the\nhearing panel in the present case was not required to circulate the May 14 en banc petition under the\npolicy in effect in September 2001.\n\n        As Judge Boggs indicates in his dissent, an initial hearing of a case en banc is an extremely\nrare occurrence. See Dissenting Op. at 88 (“I have been on the court for [sixteen] years, and I do not\nrecall an initial hearing en banc in my tenure.”). Thus, the hearing panel’s decision not to circulate\nthe petition for an initial hearing en banc in the present case — prior to the events discussed infra\n— is perfectly understandable. Indeed, if the members of the hearing panel had circulated the May\n14 petition in September 2001, the other members of the court would have likely voted not to hear\nthe case initially en banc, since Judge Boggs cannot recall any other instance of such a petition\nhaving been granted in the past sixteen years. In light of this consideration, however, I do not see\nhow the hearing panel can be faulted for not circulating the petition.\n\n         Judge Boggs also objects to the treatment of the present case as a “must panel” case, the\ncomposition of the “preselected” hearing panel, and the handling of all actions and motions related\nto this appeal by the “preselected” hearing panel. These objections are relatively minor, given the\nsubsequent decision to hear the case initially en banc.5 Indeed, this court’s decision to hear the\npresent case en banc was motivated by the concerns related to the composition of the hearing panel.\n\n\n        4\n         Of course, given the composition of the court on August 23, 2001, it would not have made\nany difference to the outcome of the case whether the en banc petition had been circulated on that\ndate, or in September, or in early October 2001.\n        5\n       These objections are also minor in that Judge Boggs does not argue that any of the decisions\nwith which he finds fault actually changed the outcome of the present case.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 27\n\n\nThese concerns were raised by Senior Circuit Judge Ralph Guy in a letter to Chief Judge Martin,\nwhich was dated October 15, 2001. The poll letter, issued by the hearing panel to the en banc court\nthat very day, stated the following rationale for circulating the petition for hearing en banc:\n\n       Re: Petition for Initial Hearing En Banc; Request for a Poll\n\n               Plaintiffs Gratz and Grutter have filed a petition for initial hearing en banc in\n       these two cases concerning the admissions policies of the University of Michigan and\n       its law school. Pursuant to the usual court policy, this petition for initial hearing en\n       banc was referred to the panel hearing the case. The reasons stated for initial hearing\n       en banc were the “exceptional importance” of the case, the “inevitable conflict” with\n       another federal circuit’s opinion in view of the already conflicting decisions of the\n       Fifth Circuit in Hopwood v.

The panel believed that the usual court policy referring\n       a petition for initial hearing en banc should be followed, and that the reasons set forth\n       for initial hearing en banc did not warrant such an initial hearing. The panel already\n       had expedited the appeal process, the conflict between the circuits already existed,\n       and we had not heard en banc any number of other exceptionally important cases.\n\n               Because of a question that has been raised regarding the composition of the\n       panel, the panel believes that the en banc court should vote on the petition for initial\n       hearing en banc. Hence the petition is attached for a vote. Since the case is\n       scheduled to be heard by the panel on Wednesday, October 23, time is of the essence\n       in deciding whether to proceed initially en banc.\n\n               Judges Daughtrey and Moore were on the initial panel in 1999 considering\n       questions of intervention.

Bollinger\nPage 28\n\n\nnor Judge Batchelder voted in this matter, but, pursuant to our rules, their non-votes were in effect\nvotes against the en banc hearing of the present case.\n\n         This court voted to hear the present case en banc in order to resolve the concerns of certain\nmembers of the court about the composition of the hearing panel. Judge Boggs and those joining\nhis opinion now complain about the composition of the en banc court. But, as I have demonstrated\nsupra, these complaints are without merit. Moreover, even if the “preselected” hearing panel had\nacted as Judge Boggs claims, which it did not, it is important to note that this did not deprive Judge\nBoggs and the other dissenters of the opportunity to call for initial hearing en banc on their own\ninitiative at any time.\n\n        The internal operating procedures of this court permit any active judge to request a poll for\nhearing a case initially en banc, regardless of whether a party has filed a petition for hearing en banc.\nSee 6 Cir. I.O.P. 35(c). If, then, Judges Boggs and others were concerned with the selection of the\nhearing panel in the present case at some point prior to October 15, 2001, there was an internal\nprocedure by which they could have addressed those concerns. As the present appeal was filed on\nApril 2, 2001, prompt action by Judges Boggs and the other dissenters would have resulted in an en\nbanc hearing before a different en banc court — or, in other words, Judge Boggs and the other\ndissenters could have called for an en banc hearing before the eleven-judge en banc court they now\nargue was deprived of this opportunity.\n\n        The simple fact of the matter is that the present case was treated as a “must panel” case as\nearly as July 2000. In Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765765\"><a href=\"/opinion/765765/barbara-grutter-for-herself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-98-2009-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1999), a panel consisting of Judge\nDaughtrey, myself, and Judge William H. Stafford, a senior district judge from the Northern District\nof Florida, reversed district court orders denying the motions of prospective intervenors to intervene\nin the present case and in its companion case, Gratz v. Bollinger. The opinion in the intervenors’\ncase was issued on August 10, 1999. Subsequent to that decision, the defendants requested\npermission to appeal the district courts’ certification of plaintiff classes in Grutter and Gratz,\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f). On July 10, 2000, the clerk of the court contacted\nJudge Daughtrey and me regarding whether those appeals (Sixth Circuit docket numbers 00-0107\nand 00-0109), which were consolidated for purposes of appeal, represented a “must panel” situation.\nWe decided that these cases did represent a “must panel” situation, where subsequent matters should\nbe returned to the original panel due to their interrelatedness with the original matter, and these cases\nwere transferred to a motions panel including Judge Daughtrey and myself.\n\n        At that time, Chief Judge Martin was substituted for Judge Stafford on the motions panel.\nSixth Circuit rules give the active members of a panel the option of recalling the district judge or\nsenior circuit judge from another circuit who sat on the panel previously or replacing that judge with\na third Sixth Circuit judge. See 6 Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(2). Although that rule states that the third Sixth\nCircuit judge should be drawn at random, Chief Judge Martin has frequently substituted himself in\na variety of matters, of varying degrees of importance, throughout his tenure as chief judge, in order\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 29\n\n\nto avoid inconveniencing other circuit judges. Thus, it was not unusual for him to place himself on\nthe panel in July 2000. To my knowledge, no one has objected before to Chief Judge Martin’s filling\nof vacancies in other cases, even though his practice of doing so is a matter of common knowledge\namong the judges of this court.\n\n        This motions panel denied the defendants’ request for permission to appeal the class\ncertification decisions on September 26, 2000. The same motions panel also granted the parties’\nrequest for permission to file interlocutory appeals in Gratz, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), on\nMarch 26, 2001 (Sixth Circuit docket numbers 01-0102 and 01-0104).\n\n         When the appeal in the present case was filed, the defendants moved this court to stay the\ndistrict court’s order enjoining the Law School from considering race as a factor in admissions. The\npanel of Chief Judge Martin, Judge Daughtrey, and myself granted this stay in a published order on\nApril 5, 2001 (Sixth Circuit docket number 01-1447). See Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772947\"><a href=\"/opinion/772947/barbara-grutter-for-herself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th\nCir. 2001). On that same date, the chief judge ordered that the appeals in Grutter and Gratz be\nexpedited, setting August 1, 2001, as the deadline for the filing of briefs and appendices. Oral\nargument was set for the court’s October term.\n\n        Thus, it should have been clear to the other members of the court, as of the published order\nof April 5, 2001, if not sooner, that the present case was being treated as a “must panel” case and that\nthe hearing panel would consist of Chief Judge Martin, Judge Daughtrey, and myself. At any point\nthereafter, Judge Boggs or any other member of the en banc court — including Judges Norris and\nSuhrheinrich, before they took senior status — could have called for a poll to determine whether the\ncase should be heard initially en banc. If there were questions regarding the composition of the\nhearing panel, then Judge Boggs and those joining his dissent could have raised those questions\nthrough this means at any time.\n\n        Judge Boggs and those joining his dissent did not raise these concerns in this manner,\nhowever. In fact, the dissenters themselves did not raise any complaints with the composition of the\nen banc court when the en banc petition was circulated, when the case was argued before the en banc\ncourt, or even in the first circulated draft of Judge Boggs’s dissent. The lateness of their complaints\nsuggests that their primary complaint is with the outcome of the present case rather than with the\nprocedures that were followed in arriving at that outcome. But unhappiness over the outcome of the\ncase cannot justify the dissenters’ “Procedural Appendix.” Judge Boggs’s opinion marks a new low\npoint in the history of the Sixth Circuit. It will irreparably damage the already strained working\nrelationships among the judges of this court, and, as discussed in Part I supra, serve to undermine\npublic confidence in our ability to perform our important role in American democracy. And for what\nreason? What purpose does the “Procedural Appendix” serve? Its author does not defend its\ninclusion, except to suggest that by placing his version of events in the record, some “remediation”\nmay be “possible.” Dissenting Op. at 89 n.49.

The Evidence Supports Diversity as a Compelling Governmental Interest\n\n         Likewise, one should not be led astray by the dissent’s contention that, Justice Powell’s\nopinion aside, developing a diverse student body cannot serve as a compelling state interest. While\ncriticizing the majority and implying that it is simply huddling behind Justice Powell’s opinion, the\ndissent claims that “the majority has given us no argument as to why the engineering of a diverse\nstudent body should be a compelling state interest sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny.” In an apparent\nattempt to elevate itself over the majority opinion, the dissent goes on to claim that it, on the other\nhand, considers “the arguments on both sides of this question . . . and conclude[s] that constructing\na diverse educational environment is not a compelling state interest.” The dissent’s claim that it\nconsiders the arguments on both sides is suspect because conspicuously absent from its consideration\nof the benefits of a diverse student body is any meaningful recognition of the wealth of legal\nscholarship – including a study involving students at the University of Michigan – speaking of, as\nwell as documenting through empirical data, the positive impact of diversity in education, not just\nfor the student throughout the educational journey but for years after the educational process is\ncompleted. Although the dissent criticizes this study on various points, the fact remains that the\nstudy has been hailed on many fronts.\n\n        Specifically, the major study conducted by University of Michigan Professor of Psychology\nand Women’s Studies Patricia Gurin, encompassed a wide scale analysis of the effects of a diverse\nlearning environment, particularly that at the University of Michigan, on a student’s overall\ndevelopment, and included data from the Michigan Student Study, the study of Intergroup Relations,\nConflict, and Community Program at the University of Michigan, and the 4-year and 9-year data on\na large national sample of institutions and students from the Cooperative Institutional Research\nProgram. See Patricia Gurin, Reports submitted on behalf of the University of Michigan: The\nCompelling Need for Diversity in Higher Education, 5 MICH. J. RACE & LAW 363, 364 (1999); see\n\n\n        2\n         In this regard, Judge Gilman’s dissent which “assumes without deciding that educational\ndiversity as defined by Justice Powell in Bakke is a compelling governmental interest” is misguided\nas well.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 33\n\n\nalso Steven A. Holmes, A New Turn in Defense of Affirmative Action, N.Y. TIMES, May 11, 1999,\nat A1 (citing Professor Gurin’s report and concluding that “the marshaling of statistical evidence of\nthe benefits of racial diversity” distinguished the present case involving the University of Michigan\nfrom similar cases involving Universities in California and Texas inasmuch as these institutions\ndefended their affirmative action policies with only “anecdotal evidence”).\n\n       Professor Gurin’s studies, and resulting statistical data, led her to conclude as follows:\n\n               A racially and ethnically diverse university student body has far-ranging and\n       significant benefits for all students, non-minorities and minorities alike. Students\n       learn better in a diverse educational environment, and they are better prepared to\n       become active participants in our pluralistic, democratic society once they leave such\n       a setting. In fact, patterns of racial segregation and separation historically rooted in\n       our national life can be broken by diversity experiences in higher education. This\n       Report describes the strong evidence supporting these conclusions derived from three\n       parallel empirical analyses of university students, as well as from existing social\n       science theory and research.\n\n               Students come to universities at a critical stage of their development, a time\n       during which they define themselves in relation to others and experiment with\n       different social roles before making permanent commitments to occupations, social\n       groups, and intimate personal relationships. In addition, for many students college\n       is the first sustained exposure to an environment other than their communities.\n       Higher education is especially influential when its social milieu is different from the\n       community background from which the students come, and when it is diverse enough\n       and complex enough to encourage intellectual experimentation. . . .\n\n               Students learn more and think deeper, more complex ways in a diverse\n       educational environment. Extensive research in social psychology demonstrates that\n       active engagement in learning cannot be taken for granted. . . . Complex thinking\n       occurs when people encounter a novel situation for which, by definition, they have\n       no script, or when the environment demands more than their current scripts provide.\n       Racial diversity in a college or university student body provides the very features that\n       research has determined are central to producing the conscious mode of thought\n       educators demand from their students. This is particularly true at the University of\n       Michigan, because most of the University’s students come to Ann Arbor from\n       segregated backgrounds. For most students, then, Michigan’s social diversity is new\n       and unfamiliar, a source or multiple and different perspectives, and likely to produce\n       contradictory expectations. Social diversity is especially likely to increase effortful,\n       active thinking when institutions of higher education capitalize on these conditions\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 34\n\n\n       in the classroom and provide a climate in which students from diverse backgrounds\n       frequently interact with each other.\n\nGurin, supra at 364-65. Professor Gurin backed these conclusions with “one of the most broad and\nextensive series of empirical analyses conducted on college students in relation to diversity.” Id. at\n365. For example, Professor Gurin examined “multi-institutional national data, the results of an\nextensive survey of students at the University of Michigan, and data drawn from a specific classroom\nprogram at the University of Michigan.” Id. All of these studies clearly indicated that interaction\nwith peers from diverse racial backgrounds, both in the classroom and informally, positively led to\nwhat Professor Gurin referred to as “learning outcomes.” That is, “[s]tudents who experienced the\nmost racial and ethnic diversity in classroom settings and in informal interactions with peers showed\nthe greatest engagement in active thinking processes, growth in intellectual engagement and\nmotivation, and growth in intellectual and academic skills.” Id.\n\n        Professor Gurin’s study also indicated that the benefits of a racially diverse student body were\nseen in a second major area, that being preparing students for a meaningful role in a democratic\nsociety, or what Professor Gurin called positive “democracy outcomes.” Id. at 365-66. “Students\neducated in diverse settings are more motivated and better able to participate in an increasingly\nheterogeneous and complex democracy.” Id. at 366. The results of Professor Gurin’s empirical\nanalysis indicated that these diversity experiences during college “had impressive effects on the\nextent to which graduates in the national study were living racially and ethnically integrated lives\nin the post-college world. Students with the most diversity experiences during college had the most\ncross-racial interactions five years after leaving college.” Id. The analysis also indicated that “[t]he\nlong-term pattern of racial separation noted by many social scientists can be broken by diversity\nexperiences in higher education.” Id.\n\n       Counsel for Plaintiffs in these underlying actions have been critical of Professor Gurin’s\nstudy and conclusions, claiming that they do nothing to refute the contention that race plays a\npredominate role in the admissions process. As one legal commentator has replied to this criticism,\n\n       [t]he critical question is not, however, whether or not race, or any other arguably\n       ‘suspect’ group characteristic, plays a ‘predominate role’ in the admissions process.\n       It is, rather, whether there is a compelling educational justification for allowing that\n       characteristic to enter the decision-making mix, and it is in that specific context that\n       the Gurin study makes a contribution.\n\nKillenbeck, supra at 1328. Professor Gurin possibly best illustrated the significance of her findings\nas to whether seeking a diverse student body may be considered a compelling state interest when she\nconcluded that,\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 35\n\n\n       [i]n the face of this research evidence, one can only remain unconvinced about the\n       impact of diversity if one believes that students are “empty vessels” to be filled with\n       specific content knowledge. Much to our chagrin as educators, we are compelled to\n       understand that students’ hearts and minds may be impacted the most by what they\n       learn from their peers. This is precisely why the diversity of the student body is\n       essential to fulfilling higher education’s mission to enhance learning and encourage\n       democratic outcomes and values.\n\nGurin, supra at 422. In light of Gurin’s study and, perhaps more importantly, the data and empirical\nevidence backing her findings on the value of a diverse student body, those who like the dissent are\nskeptical of characterizing diversity as a compelling governmental interest because “diversity” is not\ndefined or because they believe it to be a nebulous concept based on anecdotal evidence, find\nthemselves standing on ill footings. See John Friedl, Making a Compelling Case for Diversity in\nCollege Admissions, 61 U. PITT. L. REV . 1, 29-32 (1999) (noting that “[t]o date, almost all of the\nevidence in support of diversity in higher education is anecdotal in nature[,]” while discussing the\nlack of concrete, empirical evidence substantiating the value of a diverse student body as a\ncompelling state interest); see also Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 797 (“[A]ny proponent of any notion of\ndiversity could recite a . . . litany of virtues. Hence, an inquiring court cannot content itself with\nabstractions.”).\n\n        Professor Gurin’s empirical evidence supports what Justice Powell found to be true in Bakke\nregarding diversity’s place as a compelling state interest. That is, regardless of whether one agrees\nthat Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke is controlling, the fact remains that Justice Powell recognized\nthat a diverse student body is a compelling interest because it promotes the atmosphere of higher\neducation to which our nation is committed inasmuch as it allows the students to train in an\nenvironment embodied with ideas and mores “as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.” See\nRegents of the Univ. of Calif. v. Bakke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312-313 (1978) (Powell, J.)

And, along the lines of Professor Gurin’s study, it was\nexpressly noted by Justice Powell that it is the student learning from the other student that makes a\ndiverse student body a compelling need. See id. at 313 n.48. Specifically, Justice Powell noted and\nembraced the comments of the president of Princeton University as follows:\n\n       “[A] great deal of learning occurs informally. It occurs through interactions among\n       students of both sexes; of different races, religions, and backgrounds; who come from\n       cities and rural areas, from various states and countries; who have a wide variety of\n       interests, talents, and perspectives; and who are able, directly or indirectly, to learn\n       from their differences and to stimulate one another to reexamine even their most\n       deeply held assumptions about themselves and their world. As a wise graduate of\n       ours observed in commenting on this aspect of the educational process, ‘People do\n       not learn very much when they are surrounded only the by the likes of themselves.’\n                                                    ***\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 36\n\n\n        “In the nature of things, it is hard to know how, and when, and even if, this informal\n        ‘learning through diversity’ actually occurs. It does not occur for everyone. For\n        many, however, the unplanned, casual encounters with roommates, fellow sufferers\n        in an organic chemistry class, student workers in the library, teammates on a\n        basketball squad, or other participants in class affairs or student government can be\n        subtle and yet powerful sources of improved understanding and personal growth.”\n\nId. (quoting William Bowen, Admissions and the Relevance of Race, Princeton Alumni Weekly 7,\n9 (Sept. 26, 1977)). Justice Powell then expressly found that the benefits derived from a diverse\nstudent body apply with substantial force at the graduate level as well as the undergraduate level.\nSee id. Relying on Sweatt v. Painter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104804\"><a href=\"/opinion/104804/sweatt-v-painter/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1950), he reiterated that the Court made a\nsimilar point with specific reference to legal education: “‘Few students and no one who has\npracticed law would choose to study in an academic vacuum, removed from the interplay of ideas\nand the exchange of views with which the law is concerned.’” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 313-14 (quoting\nSweatt, 339 U.S. at 634).\n\n         In addition to the proffered, and indeed statistically proven, benefits of a diverse student body\nin order to fulfill higher education’s mission to enhance learning and encourage democratic\noutcomes and values, other reasons for justifying state imposed diversity in the educational realm\nhave also been proposed. For example, supporters of diversity in the university setting have argued\nthat seeking a diverse student body is consistent with this country’s historical commitment to\nabsolute equality in education.

In fact, as indicated in a detailed study conducted by Professor Linda\nF. Wightman, who at the time of her research served as Vice President for Testing, Operations, and\nResearch, Law School Admission Council, Inc., on the realities of affirmative action – “perhaps the\nmost compelling finding to emerge is not the extent to which affirmative action has opened the doors\nof legal education to African Americans and other minorities. Instead, it is the extent to which white\nlaw school applicants routinely benefit from the exceptions to the merit principle.” See id. at 1321\n(citing Linda F. Wightman, The Threat to Diversity in Legal Education: An Empirical Analysis of\nthe Consequences of Abandoning Race as a Factor in Law School Admission Decisions, 72 N.Y.U.\nL. REV . 1, 16 tbl.2 (1997)). Killenbeck explains that “[d]ata in [table 2 of Wightman’s study]\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 37\n\n\nindicate that 14.9% of accepted white applicants would not have been predicted as suitable for\nacceptance based on the combination of their undergraduate grade point average and LSAT score.\nThat is, if the purportedly objective merit criteria embraced by opponents of affirmative action were\nin fact dispositive, nearly one in every six white applicants actually accepted were arguably not\n‘qualified’ in the traditional sense.” See id. at 1321 n.100. Accordingly, for these white applicants,\nsomething more than merit was considered in the admissions process, just as something more is\nconsidered in a program designed to promote diversity. See id.; see also Susan Sturm & Lani\nGuinier, The Future of Affirmative Action: Reclaiming the Innovative Ideal, 84 CALIF . L. REV . 953,\n968-80 (1996) (criticizing the use of standardized test scores as an indicator of candidates’ suitability\nfor admission).\n\n        In short, the legal scholarship has indicated that a diverse student body serves to promote our\nnation’s deep commitment to educational equality, provides significant benefits to all students –\nminorities and non-minorities alike, and does so using a system which is not foreign to the\nadmissions process, but which allows for the benefit of all and not just some. Thus, although the\nmajority does base its holding that diversity is a compelling governmental interest on Justice\nPowell’s opinion in Bakke, it is clear that contrary to the dissent’s criticism, this holding is not\nwithout foundation even when standing alone. On the other hand, the dissent’s conclusion that\ndiversity cannot serve as a compelling state interest for purposes of surviving constitutional muster\nunder the Equal Protection Clause, is supported by neither legal scholarship nor empirical evidence.\n\n         For example, the dissent questions why race is at all relevant to promoting a student body\nrich in diversity of experience. Statistics have shown, however, that using factors other than race\nsuch as socioeconomic status, failed to produce the highly qualified, ethnically diverse student body\nachieved when race was also factored into the admissions process. See Wightman, supra at 39-45.\nThe dissent’s position simply misses that point advanced by Defendants in this case at oral argument;\nthat is, that a comparably-situated white applicant is a “different person” from the black applicant.\nThis is obvious when one considers the dissent’s criticism that the University would give diversity\npreference to a “conventionally liberal” black student who is the child of “lawyer parents living in\nGrosse Pointe” (typically thought of as one of Michigan’s more affluent suburbs).3 Notwithstanding\nthe fact that the black applicant may be similarly situated financially to the affluent white candidates,\nthis black applicant may very well bring to the student body life experiences rich in the African-\nAmerican traditions emulating the struggle the black race has endured in order for the black applicant\neven to have the opportunities and privileges to learn. See A. LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, JR., SHADES\n\n\n        3\n        The dissent originally characterized the black student as being “conventionally liberal.”\nThen, in response to the criticism that this was in itself stereotypical, the dissent added the\nparenthetical “or conventionally conservative” to its opinion. This addition, however, does nothing\nto change the fact that the dissent is engaging in stereotyping by labeling any minority group as\n“conventionally” of certain views.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 38\n\n\nOF FREEDOM, 195-96, 203 (Oxford University Press 1996) (formulating ten precepts of American\nslavery jurisprudence, with the seventh precept being the historical denial of any education to blacks\nand making it a crime to teach those who were slaves how to read and write); see also Frederick\nDouglass, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July? (1852) (addressing Rochester Ladies’ Anti-\nSlavery Society, and noting that “[i]t is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered\nwith enactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to\nwrite”).\n\n        It is insulting to African Americans, or to any race or ethnicity that has known oppression and\ndiscrimination the likes of which slavery embodies, to think that a generation enjoying the end\nproduct of a life of affluence has forgotten or cannot relate the enormous personal sacrifice made by\ntheir family members and ancestors not all that long ago in order to make the end possible. Indeed,\nwe in this country are only a generation or so removed from the legally enforced segregation which\nwas used to discriminatorily deny African Americans and other minorities access to education, as\nwell as employment, housing, health care and even basic public facilities. In addition, it is naive to\nbelieve that because an African American lives in an affluent neighborhood, he or she has not known\nor been the victim of discrimination such that he or she cannot relate the same life experiences as\nthe impoverished black person. A well dressed black woman of wealthy means shopping at Neiman\nMarcus or in an affluent shopping center may very well be treated with the same suspect eye and\nbigotry as the poorly dressed black woman of limited means shopping at Target. See Elise\nO’Shaughnessy, Shopping While Black, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING, Nov. 2001, at 129 (recounting Oprah\nWinphrey’s experience of being turned away from an affluent store while she was shopping with a\nblack female companion, even though white customers were allowed admittance, allegedly on the\npremise that the store employees were of the belief that Oprah and her friend were the black\ntranssexuals who had previously tried to rob the store; also recounting the discrimination other\nsuccessful black females such as Congresswoman Maxine Waters have experienced while shopping).\n\n        Thus, the dissent’s arguments as to why diversity cannot serve as a compelling state interest\nconstitute nothing more than myopic, baseless conclusions that ignore the daily affairs and\ninteractions of society today which very well may be experienced by all. And the dissent’s offer to\n“stipulate” to the fact that race continues to play a negative role in the lives of minorities is nothing\nmore than a mere expression of words made in an attempt to minimize the force of the many benefits\nof diversity as illustrated above. Anyone who has read the entire dissent quickly realizes that the\ndissent’s offer to stipulate that “race does matter,” constitutes a thinly-veiled offer of dubious\nsincerity, to say the least.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 39\n\n\n          This is evident by the dissent’s contention that the arguments made in favor of diversity\nmerely address societal ills that should not be confused with individual rights.4 The “societal ills”\nas characterized by the dissent are in fact borne out of the denial of individual rights such that the\ntwo cannot be separated. Indeed, history tells us that the Equal Protection Clause was enacted in an\nattempt to cure the “societal ills” that had denied African Americans the individual rights to which\nthey were entitled, such as the right to an education. See ALBERT P. BLAUSTEIN & CLARENCE CLYDE\nFERGUSON, JR., DESEGREGATION AND THE LAW - THE MEANING AND EFFECT OF THE SCHOOL\nSEGREGATION CASES 59-67 (Rutgers University Press 1985) (1957). It has been recognized that “the\nevil to remedied by this clause” was the “gross injustice and hardship” faced by the “newly\nemancipated Negroes” as a class. See In re Slaughter-House Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88661\"><a href=\"/opinion/88661/slaughter-house-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81 (1873). And\nit has been further recognized that the justifications for the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification\n“retain their validity in modern times, for 114 years after the close of the War Between the States,\n. . . racial and other forms of discrimination still remain a fact of life, in the administration of justice\nas in our society as a whole.” See Vasquez v. Hillery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111552\"><a href=\"/opinion/111552/vasquez-v-hillery/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264 (1986). Accordingly, for\nthe dissent to claim that “people like Barbara Grutter” are being denied equal treatment under the\nlaw school’s admission policy such that the Equal Protection Clause is being “ignored,” particularly\nwhile irreverently invoking the name of Abraham Lincoln, is completely unfounded. The law\nschool’s goal of creating a diverse student body, which has not existed previously and would not\notherwise exist without its admissions policy, rests in the very heart of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n        Moreover, contrary to the dissent’s assertion, there is nothing to indicate that the law school’s\nadmission’s policy has “taken” anything “from the Barbara Grutters of our society.” As one legal\nscholar has recently illustrated, the idea that an admissions policy which provides minority applicants\nwith an advantage does so at the expense of white applicants is simply a myth. See Goodwin Liu,\nThe Myth & Math of Affirmative Action, The Washington Post, April 14, 2002, at B01 (citing\nexcerpts from his article “The Causation Fallacy: Bakke and the Basic Arithmetic of Selective\nAdmissions” which is to be published in the upcoming edition of the Michigan Law Review). As\nLiu makes note,\n\n        [f]or many Americans, the success of Bakke’s lawsuit has long highlighted what is\n        unfair about affirmative action: Giving minority applicants a significant advantage\n\n\n        4\n         I bring to the fore the “societal ills” – as the dissent has couched it – of the past and present\nfaced by minorities to illustrate that, contrary to the dissent’s assertion, a minority member of\nwealthy means may bring to the educational environment the same “life experiences” that a minority\nmember of impoverished means may bring because the “societal ills” experienced by both transcend\neconomic status. Once again, the reader should not be led astray by the dissent’s attempt to ignore\nor reframe an issue. While it is true that the Supreme Court has found that a generalized claim of\npast discrimination cannot serve as the basis for a remedial plan, no such claim is being made in this\ncase.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 40\n\n\n       causes deserving white applicants to lose out. But to draw such an inference in\n       Bakke’s case – or in the case of the vast majority of rejected white applicants – is to\n       indulge in . . . “the causation fallacy.”\n\n       There’s no doubt, based on test scores and grades, that Bakke was a highly qualified\n       applicant. Justice Lewis Powell, who authored the decisive opinion in the case,\n       observed that Bakke’s Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores placed him\n       in the top tier of test-takers, whereas the average scores of the quota beneficiaries in\n       1974 placed them in the bottom third. Likewise, his science grade point average was\n       3.44 on a 4.0 scale, compared with at 2.42 average for the special admittees, and his\n       overall GPA was similarly superior. Given these numbers, the only reason for\n       Bakke’s rejection was the school’s need to make room for less qualified minority\n       applicants, right?\n\n       Wrong. Although Justice Powell pointed out that minority applicants were admitted\n       with grades and test scores much lower than Bakke’s, he did not discuss what I found\n       to be the most striking data that appeared in his opinion: Bakke’s grades and scores\n       were significantly higher than the average for the regular admittees. In other words,\n       his academic qualifications were better than those of the majority of applicants\n       admitted outside the racial quota. So why didn’t he earn one of the 84 regular\n       places?\n\n       It is clear that the medical school admitted students not only on the basis of grades\n       and test scores, but on other factors relevant to the study and practice of medicine,\n       such as compassion, communication skills and commitment to research. Justice\n       Powell’s opinion does not tell us exactly what qualities the regular admittees had that\n       Bakke lacked. But it notes that the head of the admissions committee, who\n       interviewed Bakke, found him “rather limited in approach” to medical problems and\n       thought he had “very definite opinions which were based more on his personal\n       viewpoints than upon a study of the total problem.”\n\n       Whatever Bakke’s weaknesses were, there were several reasons, apart from\n       affirmative action, that might have led the medical school to reject his application.\n       Grades and test scores do not tell us the whole story.\nId.\n\n        Liu went on to recognize that although affirmative action did lower Bakke’s chance of\nadmission to the medical school, what was significant and most telling is “by how much?” Id.\nSetting forth the statistical data Liu then observed:\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 41\n\n\n       One way to answer this question is to compare Bakke’s chance of admission had he\n       competed for all 100 seats in the class with his chance of admission competing for\n       the 84 seats outside of the racial quota. To simplify, let’s assume none of the special\n       applicants would have been admitted ahead of any regular candidate.\n\n       In 1974, Bakke was one of 3,109 regular applicants to the medical school. With the\n       racial quota, the average likelihood of admission for regular applicants was 2.7\n       percent (84 divided by 3,109). With no racial quota, the average likelihood of\n       admission would have been 3.2 percent (100 divided by 3,109). So the quota\n       increased the average likelihood of rejection from 96.8 percent to 97.3 percent.\n\n       To be sure, Bakke was not an average applicant. Only one-sixth of regular applicants\n       (roughly 520) received an interview. But even among these highly qualified\n       applicants, eliminating the racial quota would have increased the average rate of\n       admission from 16 percent (84 divided by 520) to only 19 percent (100 divided by\n       520). Certainly a few more regular applicants would have been admitted were it not\n       for affirmative action. But Bakke, upon receiving his rejection letter, had no reason\n       to believe he would have been among the lucky few.\n\n       In fact, Bakke applied in both 1973 and 1974 and, according to evidence in the\n       lawsuit, he did not even make the waiting list in either year.\n\n       The statistical pattern in Bakke’s case is not an anomaly. It occurs in any selection\n       process in which the applicants who do not benefit from affirmative action greatly\n       outnumber those who do.\n\n       Recent research confirms this point. Using 1989 data from a representative sample\n       of selective schools, former university presidents William Bowen and Derek Bok\n       showed in their 1998 book, “The Shape of the River,” that eliminating racial\n       preferences would have increased the likelihood of admission for white\n       undergraduate applicants from 25 percent to only 26.5 percent.\n\n       The Mellon Foundation, which sponsored the study, provided me with additional\n       data to calculate admission rates by SAT score. If the schools in the Bowen/Bok\n       sample had admitted applicants with similar SAT scores at the same rate regardless\n       of race, the chance of admission for white applicants would have increased by one\n       percentage point or less at scores 1300 and above, by three to four percentage points\n       at scores from 1150 to 1299, and by four to seven percentage points at scores below\n       1150.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 42\n\n\n       It is true that black applicants were admitted at much higher rates than white\n       applicants with similar grades and test scores. But that fact does not prove that\n       affirmative action imposes a substantial disadvantage on white applicants. The\n       extent of the disadvantage depends on the number of blacks and whites in the\n       applicant pool. Because the number of black applicants to selective institutions is\n       relatively small, admitting them a higher rates does not significantly lower the chance\n       of admission for the average individual in the relatively large sea of white applicants.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n       Liu provided further statistical data to back this conclusion as follows:\n\n       In the Bowen/Bok study, for example, 60 percent of black applicants scoring 1200-\n       1249 on the SAT were admitted, compared with 19 percent of whites. In the 1250-\n       1299 range, 74 percent of blacks were admitted, compared with 23 percent of whites.\n       These data indicate – more so than proponents of affirmative action typically\n       acknowledge – that racial preferences give minority applicants a substantial\n       advantage. But eliminating affirmative action would have increased the admission\n       rate for whites from 19 percent to only 21 percent in the 1200-1249 range, and from\n       23 percent to only 24 percent in the 1250-1299 range.\n\n       These figures show that rejected white applicants have every reason not to blame\n       their misfortune on affirmative action. In selective admissions, the competition is so\n       intense that even without affirmative action, the overwhelming majority of rejected\n       white applicants still wouldn’t get in.\n\nId. (emphasis added). And so, contrary to the dissent’s assertion, “the Barbara Grutters of our\nsociety” have no reason to claim that anything has been “taken” from them by virtue of the law\nschool’s admission policy. In purporting otherwise, the dissent is simply advancing “the causation\nfallacy” which Liu exposes for the myth that it is.\n\n        The dissent also contends that one cannot consider the remedial qualities of correcting past\n– or for that matter present – discrimination as a way of supporting the law school’s admissions\npolicy because past discrimination is not the basis upon which the school claims that its admissions\npolicy is operating. Once again, the dissent’s narrow-mindedness misses the point. While it is true\nthat the law school’s policy is based upon its desire to achieve a diverse student body, the very\nreason that the law school is in need of a program to create a diverse environment is because the\ndiscrimination faced by African Americans and other minorities throughout the educational process\nhas not produced a diverse student body in the normal course of things. Diversity in education, at\nits base, is the desegregation of a historically segregated population and, as the intervenors\nessentially argue, Bakke and Brown must therefore be read together so as to allow a school to\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 43\n\n\nconsider race or ethnicity in its admissions for many reasons, including to remedy past discrimination\nor present racial bias in the educational system. See Trevor W. Coleman, A well-deserved honor for\na lifelong legal barrier breaker, The Detroit Free Press, April 26, 2002, at 10A (chronicling the life\nof the Honorable William McClain, the University of Michigan’s oldest living African-American\nlaw graduate, and describing how, as the only black law student in his class at the University,\nMcClain was “fed humiliation nearly every day,” was forbidden from living in the law quad, and was\n“prevented from joining study groups which are essential to a legal education”).\n\n         In summary, the dissent’s attempt to cast the law school’s interest in achieving a diverse\nstudent body as anything but compelling simply cannot carry the day, and its claim that white\napplicants are being denied equal protection under the law as a result of the school’s attempt to\nachieve a diverse student body is fallacious. As next illustrated, the dissent’s arguments as to why\nthe school’s admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve this compelling interest are just\nas ill-conceived.\n\n       C.      The Law School’s Policy is Narrowly Tailored\n\n       The dissent quarters its argument as to why the law school’s admissions policy is not\nnarrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest of diversity. Each of the four subparts bear\narguments that are unfounded and inflammatory. For example, in first discussing what the dissent\ncharacterizes as the true magnitude of the law school’s policy, the dissent focuses on LSAT and\nUGPA data. It then advances the outrageous contention that the law school’s policy allows for a\nminority applicant to put forth less effort than the otherwise similarly situated white applicant, and\nthat somehow the minority will therefore use his race to compensate for his lack of effort. There is\nnothing whatsoever in the record to support the allegation that the law school’s admissions policy\nwould be manipulated in this fashion by people of color or ethnicity.\n\n        Similarly, the dissent’s assertion that the law schools treatment of numerical credentials\n(UGPA and LSAT scores) for purposes of admission is “shocking,” ignores the scholarly writings\nshowing no correlation between these numerical credentials and success in law school or bar passage\nrates. See Wightman, supra at 1-2 (explaining that while a “numbers only” policy resulted in a sharp\ndecline in the number of minority students who would have been admitted to law school, there were\nno significant differences in the graduation rates and bar passage rates between those minority\nstudents who would have been admitted and those who would not have been admitted, thus leading\nto the conclusion that a “numbers only” policy would deny a legal education to many minority\nstudents who were fully capable of the rigors of a legal education and of entering the legal\nprofession); Sturm & Guinier, supra at 968-80 (explaining standardized test scores’ lack of\npredictive value with respect to students’ future performance). The law school’s effort to insure that\nits admissions process is inclusionary and is not substantively unfair should be viewed as an effort\nto advance the cause of both educational excellence and diversity, not as a counterpoint to a “merit”\nplan as suggested by the dissent. The case has not been convincingly made that conventional\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 44\n\n\nadmissions plans which equate to higher socio-economic status persuasively correlate to\nconsideration of “merit.” See id. at 992-96.\n\n        The dissent barely conceals its disbelief in the truth of the law school’s assertion that its\nadmissions officer reads every applicant’s file and makes an individualized determination regarding\nthe applicant’s suitability for admission. Accepting the dissent’s argument requires, in part, rejecting\nthe law school’s description of the manner in which its admissions program is administered without\nany adequate justifiable basis for doing so. The dissent goes so far as to claim the above-referenced\ncriticisms of using standardized test scores such as the LSAT and numerical credentials as means\nto admission should be directed to the law school and not to the dissent inasmuch as the law school\nchooses to consider such credentials in its admission policy. However, the dissent’s claim in this\nregard misses the point, and is an example of the misrepresentations made by the dissent in an\napparent attempt to reframe the issues. Criticism of the use of numerical credentials such as LSAT\nscores is made in this opinion to support the law school’s use of other criteria in its admission policy\n– one of which is race or ethnicity. And, contrary to the dissent’s inflammatory assertion, the law\nschool relies upon many factors in addition to LSAT scores, UGPAs, and race in its admission\nprocess. Although this assertion undoubtedly bolsters the dissent’s position, it is unfounded and flies\nin the face of the record before us.\n\n         The dissent next calls into question the law school’s designation of a “critical mass” of\nminority students in its student body. Claiming that the term “critical mass” is simply a phrase used\nto disguise what is actually an impermissible quota system, the dissent relies heavily upon the fact\nthat the numbers of minorities admitted over the years has varied only sightly. There may be any\nnumber of likely benign explanations for the numerical configurations, including a consistency in\nthe quality of minority applications for a few successive years and/or the application of a uniformity\nof perspective in evaluating the applications resulting from having the same evaluators read all the\napplications for admissions. Even idiosyncratic explanations for a relatively narrow numerical range\nfor a number of years would be constitutionally acceptable in the absence of a quota or other\ninvidious motivation on the part of the law school. The point is that on the record of this case, there\nare at least as many reasons to presume that there is not a quota as there are to presume that there is\none, and the balance certainly tips in favor of the law school’s representation that it does not employ\na quota in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.5\n\n      Typically, the purpose of the narrow tailoring inquiry involves an evaluation of the fit\nbetween the compelling interest and the policy adopted to advance that interest. See Recent Cases,\n115 HARV . L. REV . 1239, 1244-45 (2002) (criticizing the Eleventh Circuit’s decision that found the\nUniversity of Georgia’s race-conscious admissions policy unconstitutional, while noting that the\n\n\n       5\n         Inasmuch as Judge Gilman appears to rest his dissent on his belief that the law school’s\npolicy results in an impermissible quota system, his conclusion is fallacious as well.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 45\n\n\ncourt’s opinion “reveals both overt and covert hostility toward affirmative action policies” and that\n“[b]y introducing its own substantive agenda under the guise of a narrow tailoring analysis, the court\nstrayed from the purpose of the narrow tailoring inquiry”). Here, the dissent claims that the link\nbetween the law school’s “critical mass” and the values of diversity is lacking. Oddly, the dissent\ncites the report from Professor Gurin, the same report that others have hailed as showing documented\nevidence for the benefits of a diverse student body, claiming that the results indicate just the opposite\nof how Professor Gurin reports them. This contention, regardless of its accuracy, appears to be in\ncriticism of the concept of diversity itself, and not of the process to achieve that end.\n\n         Next, the dissent criticizes the relationship between diversity and the means to promote this\ninterest as being dependent upon the psychological makeup of the people involved. The dissent\nrefers to historical black leaders such as Frederick Douglass and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., opining\nthat these men would have said their piece without regard to whether others thought them to be\n“representative.” Apparently, by using these black leaders to make its point, the dissent is claiming\nthat the process employed by the law school is not necessary because if an African American, or\nother minority group member, has the “psychological” make-up to be a leader, he will be so\nregardless of whether he is one among ten or one among one hundred. Such an allegation misses\nthe point of the many beneficial aspects of diversity in education to minorities and non-minorities\nalike, is an affront to the sacrifices and contributions made by these black leaders, and does nothing\nto show why the law school’s policy is not narrowly tailored. In fact, the dissent appears to be doing\nnothing more than “introducing its own substantive agenda under the guise of a narrow tailoring\nanalysis” in making its arguments here. See Recent Cases, supra at 1239.\n\n        Finally, the dissent claims that because race-neutral means are available to achieve academic\ndiversity, the law school’s program does not pass constitutional muster. In reaching this conclusion,\nthe dissent completely ignores the evidence provided by the law school and its efforts to formulate\na viable race-neutral policy. The dissent strongly suggests that it simply does not believe the law\nschool’s representation that it considered and rejected as unworkable or impractical other admissions\npolicies and procedures, either because the available alternatives would not result in the sort of\ncompetitive student body pursued by the law school overall, or because the number of qualified\nminority students attracted to the law school would be inadequate. The law school’s premise, which\nthe dissent fails to convincingly dispute, is that the number of minority law students admitted would\nbe inconsequential in the absence of the school’s current admissions program.\n\n         Indeed, one of the dissent’s proposals as a “race-neutral” means of admission, using a lottery\nfor all students above certain threshold figures for their GPA and LSAT, is in no way “race-neutral”\nas reflected in the record. For example, the record indicates (through the testimony of Jay Rosner,\nMartin Shapiro, and David White among others) that performance on tests such as the LSAT and the\nSAT correlates with an applicant’s race and gender. In other words, the record indicates that LSAT\nscores are neither race-neutral or gender-neutral criteria for admissions decisions. Consequently, the\ndissent’s proposal of using a lottery based upon scores resulting from these tests in order to achieve\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 46\n\n\na race-neutral means of admission is inherently flawed, and would in no way reflect race-neutral\nmerit. Instead, such a proposal would reflect a combination of subtle preferences based on race,\ngender, and even class, see Sturm & Guinier, supra at 992-96; see also supra text accompanying Part\nB, and are of limited utility for predicting meaningful success across racial lines.\n\n        At its core, in purporting to suggest race-neutral methodologies, the dissent simply engages\nin an impermissible exercise of substituting its judgment in this regard for that of the educators who\nare the custodians and guardians of the law school’s mission and academic standards.

Indeed, on the record before us, any purportedly race-\nneutral policy could result in a de facto segregated law school, the deleterious results of which have\nlong been known by society and rejected by the Court. See, e.g., Sweatt, 339 U.S. at 634-36.\n\n       D.      Summary\n\n        Chief Judge Martin’s majority opinion reversing the district court and finding the law\nschool’s admissions policy constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment provides a clear understanding and resolution of the issues involved. The dissent’s\nattempt to turn the majority opinion on its head and to reframe the issues does nothing to advance\nthe jurisprudence on this very significant matter.\n\n       E.      Response to the Dissent’s “Procedural Appendix”\n\n        Although the dissent’s substantive attack, which is grounded in neither fact nor law, is\ndisturbing, the dissent’s procedural attack, as set forth in its “Procedural Appendix,” constitutes an\nembarrassing and incomprehensible attack on the integrity of the Chief Judge and this Court as a\nwhole. Apparently, the dissent’s strategy in this regard is that if its substantive basis for\ndisagreement with the majority opinion is not convincing, then questioning the procedural posture\nof this case will be enough to forever cast doubt upon the outcome reached here today. This\nunfortunate tactic has no place in scholarly jurisprudence and certainly does not deserve to be\ndignified with a response. However, because of the magnitude of the issues involved, and because\nof the baseless nature of the allegations, this procedural attack cannot go unanswered.\n\n        The dissent questions the appropriateness of hearing this case en banc, the course by which\nthis case came to be heard by the en banc court, and the composition of the en banc court itself. It\nshould be noted at the outset that throughout the pendency of this appeal, the dissent remained silent\non all of these questions until now, and its concerns should therefore be regarded as having been\nwaived or forfeited. It was not until the various opinions had been circulated throughout the Court\nand the votes cast by the panel members that the dissent revised its opinion by tacking on these\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 47\n\n\ncomplaints and allegations. And the dissent’s new-found allegations of impropriety as to the course\nthis matter followed in reaching the en banc court simply defy belief. It is ludicrous to think that\nwith our circuit operating with only one-half of the active judges’ positions filled, and with over\n4000 cases reaching our Court each year, the Chief Judge or any members of this Court would single\nout any one particular case and maneuver the system for a particular outcome. None of the decisions\nmade by the Chief Judge in regard to the scheduling of this case or in relation to administering the\nCourt’s docket, differ in any significant way from the decisions the Chief Judge and the Court’s staff\nroutinely and frequently make with respect to pending matters. Given the voluminous nature of the\nCourt’s docket and the shortage of judicial resources, the case management tasks performed by the\nChief Judge are both necessary and appropriate, and were not in any sense improperly performed in\nrelation to the instant case.\n\n        Again, it is unfortunate that the dissent has chosen to stoop to such desperate and unfounded\nallegations which serve no useful purpose. The dissent’s claim that it is “legitimizing” the Court by\nrevealing the procedural course of this matter is disingenuous, at best, when considering that the\ndissent (Judge Boggs) once scathingly attacked Judge Damon J. Keith for revealing the vote count\nin a case of major import wherein the denial for rehearing en banc was split seven-seven. See\nMemphis Planned Parenthood v. Sundquist, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765271\"><a href=\"/opinion/765271/memphis-planned-parenthood-inc-v-don-sundquist-governor-of-the-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 605-07 (6th Cir. 1999) (published order)\n(Boggs, J.). Judge Keith wrote in Memphis that he revealed the seven-seven vote tally because it\nsupported his belief that the majority’s opinion was result driven, and to encourage the litigant to\npossibly seek further review. See id. at 601-02 (Keith, J.). Judge Keith emphasized that in making\nthe vote tally known, he had “not violated any rule of internal policy . . .; nor [had he] divulged any\ninternal confidential communications[,]” and found “reprehensible” the “practices of secrecy and\nconcealment advocated by Judge Boggs.” Id. at 605. In response, Judge Boggs noted “with regret,\n[Judge Keith’s alleged] breach of the long-standing custom of this court that actions by a member\nof the court with respect to petitions for rehearing of en banc matters are matters of internal court\nprocedure and are not made public by other judges.” Id. (Boggs, J.) (emphasis added). Judge Boggs\nwent so far as to question the accuracy of Judge Keith’s conveyance of the vote tally by writing that\n“our court, of course, makes no warranties as to the accuracy of the assertions made in statements\nby judges (including, of course, this one).” Id. at 605.\n\n        Despite his one-time “regret” for a fellow jurist’s decision to make the vote tally known in\nan en banc case, Judge Boggs now characterizes his flagrant disregard for the Court’s procedural\nmeasures with respect to this case as a form of “legitimacy.” Judge Boggs has revealed internal\nprocedural matters to the public, particularly when he speaks of Senior Judge Ralph Guy’s internal\ncommunication to Chief Judge Martin in footnote 46 of his dissent. Furthermore, the remaining\nmembers of this Court have no way of responding to any inaccuracies by Judge Boggs regarding\nJudge Guy’s communication – or Judge Boggs’ characterization thereof – without themselves\nresorting to discussing the Court’s internal communications. Like many of the assertions made in\nhis dissent as a whole, Judge Boggs’ renouncement of secrecy and claim that his procedural\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 48\n\n\nappendix “legitimizes” the Court, are hollow, particularly in light of his position in Memphis.\nIndeed, it was “secrecy” for which Judge Boggs so vehemently argued in Memphis.\n\n        If anything, the fact that this significant matter was heard initially by the en banc court is a\ncourse of action advocated by justices of the United States Supreme Court. For example, in her letter\nto the White Commission, and several times in addressing the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference,\nJustice O’Connor, circuit justice to the Ninth Circuit, has suggested that the courts of appeals sit en\nbanc in matters they think are likely to reach the Supreme Court. See Stephen L. Wasby, How do\nCourts of Appeals En Banc Decisions Fare in the U.S. Supreme Court?, JUDICATURE , Jan. -Feb.\n2002, at 184 & n.6. Likewise, Justice Kennedy, himself a former member of the Ninth Circuit,\nsuggested to the White Commission that “questions of exceptional importance” are not heard en\nbanc nearly often enough. See id. at 184 & n.7 (quoting Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, letter to\nJustice Bryon R. White, August 17, 1998).\n\n        Here, in this matter of exceptional importance which may likely reach the Supreme Court,\nwe as an en banc court have properly and carefully considered the issues involved. Chief Judge\nMartin’s thorough majority opinion in every regard reflects that careful consideration, such that the\noutcome reached today is one based upon nothing other than sound and scholarly deliberation.\nDespite its unfortunate and desperate attempts to portray the majority opinion as anything less, the\ndissent’s substantive and procedural attacks remain unpersuasive.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v.

This case involves a straightforward instance of racial\ndiscrimination by a state institution.

In our case, the intent of the framers of the policy,\nthe statistics as to its impact and effect, and the history of its inception all point unmistakably to a\ndenial of equal protection of the laws. I, therefore, dissent from our court’s decision today finding\nthis discrimination to be constitutional.\n\n         In tracing the intricacies of the argument presented by the court and by the Law School, we\nmust be aware that the definitions and precise connotations of words are of crucial importance. As\nI shall demonstrate, in many critical instances, key words are used in ways contrary to their normal\ngrammatical meaning, or with very specific qualifications attached sub silentio. In the words of\nGeorge Orwell, in his famous essay Politics and the English Language, “a mass of Latin words falls\nupon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outline and covering up all the details.” George Orwell,\nPolitics and the English Language, in 4 THE COLLECTED ESSAYS, JOURNALISM AND LETTERS OF\nGEORGE ORWELL : IN FRONT OF YOUR NOSE , 1945-1950 127 (Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus, eds.,\nHarcourt, Brace 1968).\n\n        A very revealing example of this is the use of the term “affirmative action” to refer to the\npolicies in question. See Majority Op. at 3 (discussing intervening student groups, including “United\nfor Equality and Affirmative Action, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action By Any Means\nNecessary, and Law Students for Affirmative Action”). Standing alone, the term “affirmative\naction” might mean anything from affirmative action to study harder to affirmative action to exclude\nminorities. However, as used in the context of our society’s struggle against racial discrimination,\nthe term first enters the public print and the national vocabulary in Executive Order 10925, issued\nby President John F. Kennedy on March 6, 1961 and subsequently incorporated into a wide variety\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 50\n\n\nof statutes and regulations. It ordered government contractors to “take affirmative action, to ensure\nthat applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to\ntheir race, creed, color, or national origin” Ibid. (emphasis added). It is thus clear that whatever else\nMichigan’s policy may be, it is not “affirmative action.”1\n\n        The Law School absolutely insists that it does not consider applicants “without regard to”\ntheir race. See, e.g., Admissions Policies, University of Michigan Law School, April 22, 1992, at\n12 (noting “a commitment to racial and ethnic diversity with special reference to the inclusion of\nstudents from groups which have been historically discriminated against . . . [and] who without this\ncommitment might not be represented in our student body in meaningful numbers”). Instead, as is\ndiscussed by the majority and will be discussed at length below, Michigan considers all applicants\nwith exquisite regard for their race and national origin. As I put it to the counsel for the Law School\nin oral argument, if Heman Sweatt, the plaintiff in the famous case of Sweatt v. Painter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104804\"><a href=\"/opinion/104804/sweatt-v-painter/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1950), had been able to ask the Dean of the University of Texas Law School, “Dean, would you\nlet me in if I were white?,” the dean, if he were honest, would surely have said “Yes.” I then asked\ncounsel, “If Barbara Grutter walked in to whoever the current Dean of the Law School is and said,\n\n\n        1\n        I will occasionally use the phrases “race” and “racial” as a shorthand for the type of\npreference accorded by the Law School. In fact, the groups chosen for preference are a melange of\ngroupings that are socially defined:\n\n        by skin color (“black” or “African-American.” I note that the children of Boer or Berber\n        immigrants are not conventionally given the latter label, which would surely apply to them\n        as a linguistic matter.);\n\n        by national origin (as the Census Bureau carefully notes, “Hispanics” can be of any race.\n        Presumably, the children of the former Peruvian president, Alberto Fujimori, though\n        ethnographically purely Japanese, would be considered “Hispanic.”);\n\n        or by legal status (depending on whether Michigan limits “Native American” preference to\n        legally enrolled tribal members, as opposed to those with sufficient ancestry of “Indian”\n        status that would qualify a person with comparable black or Hispanic ancestry for those\n        designations).\n\n        Any shorthand use of those terms in this opinion should be understood to have all the\nrelevant qualifiers. For similar precision by other universities with racial and ethnic preferences,\nsee Brief of Amicus Curiae, Columbia Univ., Harvard Univ., Stanford Univ., and the Univ. of Penn.,\nin Regents of the Univ. of California v. Bakke, 99 LANDMA RK BRIEFS AND ARGUMENTS OF THE\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES : CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 1977 TERM SUPP . 689, 698 n.3\n(Phillip B. Kurland & Gerhard Casper, eds., 1978).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 51\n\n\n‘Dean, would you let me in if I were black?’ wouldn’t he have to honestly say either ‘Yes’ or ‘pretty\ndarn almost certain[ly]’?” Counsel agreed, but responded that “a black woman who had otherwise\nan application that looked like Barbara Grutter, that would be a different person.” Tr. at 38 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n       That answer puts starkly the policy of discrimination practiced throughout the ages.\n\n        Throughout this discussion, my quarrel is with the constitutionality of the policy, not its\nproponents. In a related context, Robert’s Rules of Order gives a good rule for public disputation:\nthose engaged in a debate “can condemn the nature or likely consequences of the proposed measure\nin strong terms, but . . . under no circumstances . . . attack or question the motives of another.”\nGeneral Henry M. Robert, ROBERT ’S RULES OF ORDER 380 (10th ed. 2000). I have no doubt that\nthe proponents of this discriminatory policy act with the most tender of motives. However, the noble\nmotives of those propounding unconstitutional policies should not save those policies, just as some\nsegregationists’ genuine belief that segregated education provided better education for both races was\ninadequate to justify those policies.\n\n         Finally, I do not doubt that there are strong policy arguments for what Michigan has done.\nThere is a plausible (though perhaps not a sound) policy argument that government should arrange\nsocial outcomes proportionally according to the race or ethnicity of its citizens, remedying, where\nit can, any pervasively unequal distribution of wealth, education, or status. There are many countries\n– India, Malaysia, and Serbia, to name a few – where such a policy is practiced. For more on\n“affirmative action” worldwide, see Thomas Sowell, RACE AND CULTURE : A WORLD VIEW 126-29\n(Basic 1994). However, so long as the Equal Protection Clause is a part of the United States\nConstitution, the United States is not one of those countries. The fact that some might think this\nsociety would be a better one if more governmental benefits were allocated, because of their racial\nor ethnic status, to blacks, Hispanics, or Native Americans and less to whites, Asians, or Jews, or\nvice-versa, does not make those policies permissible under our Constitution.\n\n        Instead, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment decided that our government should\nabstain from social engineering through explicit racial classifications. Thus, we subject every state\nracial classification to “strict scrutiny,” requiring that the state show both that the classification\nfurthers a “compelling state interest” and that it is “narrowly tailored” to achieve that interest.\nAdarand Constructors v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235 (1995). The Law School’s admissions scheme\nsimply cannot withstand the scrutiny that the Constitution demands.\n\n       My discussion of the reasons for that conclusion falls into two parts below. First, I examine\nwhy the majority’s reading of Bakke is erroneous. Read correctly, Bakke remains good law, but does\nnot conclusively resolve the questions before this court. More recent decisions of the Supreme\nCourt, contrary to Grutter’s argument and what the district court in this case held, place these\nquestions in no greater relief.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 52\n\n\n        We are therefore faced with resolving for ourselves the constitutionality of the Law School’s\nadmissions scheme. Our inquiry must address at least one open question of law: can achieving\ndiversity be a compelling state interest? On this open question, I have no argument to which to\nrespond, as the majority never explains why “diversity” should be a compelling state interest, except\nto say that the conclusion is demanded by Bakke.2 After considering the arguments on both sides,\nI conclude that the state’s interest in a diverse student body, at least as articulated by the Law School,\ncannot constitute a compelling state interest sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny.\n\n        Second, much like Justice Powell’s in Bakke, my answer to whether the engineering of a\nracially diverse student body is a compelling state interest is not necessary to the resolution of the\ncase before this court. Even if student diversity were a compelling state interest, the Law School’s\nadmissions scheme could not be considered narrowly tailored to that interest. Even a cursory glance\nat the Law School’s admissions data reveals the staggering magnitude of the Law School’s racial\npreference. Its admissions officers have swapped tailor’s shears for a chainsaw.\n\nI. The State of the Current Law\n\nA. Bakke in a Nutshell\n\n        The Law School and the majority of this court argue that the constitutionality of the Law\nSchool’s policy is mandated by Supreme Court precedent, engaging in a painstaking analysis of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978),\nand the instructions given in Marks v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977), for attempting to discern\na “holding” from decisions in which the Court is splintered. I will engage in an equally detailed\ncounter-analysis; however, I begin with what is obvious from the face of the opinion.\n\n       In Bakke, the Supreme Court held that the particular type of massive racial discrimination\nengaged in by the University of California at Davis – setting aside a certain number of seats each\nyear and utilizing a separate admissions system for minority applicants – was illegal and that Allan\nBakke had a right not to be so discriminated against.3 (This fact is not revealed until page 12 of the\nmajority’s decision, and then only obliquely). However, five members of the Court agreed that a\n\n\n        2\n        The concurring opinion does present substantive arguments on this point, which are\nconsidered in Part II.A. Concurring Op. at 29-39 (Clay).\n        3\n         The judgment of the Court, affirming the judgment of the California Supreme Court and\nordering UC Davis to admit Bakke, was supported by the opinions of Justice Powell, Bakke, 438\nU.S. at 320, who would have held that UC Davis’s program violated the Fourteenth Amendment,\nand Justice Stevens, Id. at 421, who was joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart and\nRehnquist in his argument that the program violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 53\n\n\nblanket injunction that race could never be considered in admissions programs was at least\npremature, and one of those members went on to state that race could be used to promote diversity\nand proffered the race-conscious admissions program briefly described in an amicus brief by Harvard\nUniversity as a model of such a plan.4\n\n        Unfortunately, no policy other than the specific one utilized by UC Davis was before the\nCourt. Thus, no matter what analytical artillery is applied to deconstruct the various Bakke opinions,\nwe cannot come up with a “holding” that is any more specific than that UC Davis’s plan (and all\nplans that absolutely reserve a specific number of seats for the racially favored) was unconstitutional,\nand that some type of racial preference may be constitutional.\n\n       The majority in this case applies extremely subtle reasoning to come to the conclusion that\nBakke should instead be read to hold that the use of race, no matter how extensive, is constitutional\nso long as it does not specify a number of seats to be reserved for minorities and so long as it\narguably tracks the Harvard plan. The majority’s reasoning is problematic for several reasons.\n\n         Consider an exact analogy in the field of criminal law. Let us assume that state C has a\npolicy that its prison guards may beat prisoners to within “half an inch of their lives” for any\ndisciplinary infraction. When that policy is challenged in the Supreme Court, the Court’s holding\nis that the particular policy is unconstitutional, but that it will not issue an injunction against guards\never touching a prisoner for any infraction. Four members of the court believe that the policy is\nconstitutional in its entirety, and therefore dissent from the portion of the opinion holding C’s policy\nunconstitutional. Four other Justices argue that guards should never be allowed to punish prisoners\nphysically, and therefore dissent from the portion of the opinion refusing to issue an injunction\nagainst guards ever touching prisoners. A swing Justice strikes down the policy before him, but\nargues that at some time, in some manner, physical discipline might be appropriate. In particular,\nhe speaks favorably of the plan of a particular state (call it the “H” plan) where, under some\ncircumstances not specifically delineated, a guard could administer some unspecified amount of\nphysical chastisement.\n\n        Following this decision, another state, call it M, defends its policy on the grounds that it\nmerely authorizes guards to beat prisoners within “an inch of their lives” (as opposed to “half an\ninch”), and that it is specifically modeled after the H plan. Under the majority’s logic, any lower\ncourt confronted with this policy would be required to find it constitutional.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n        The description of the Harvard plan in this amicus brief was exceedingly short and\nundetailed, consisting of less than four pages. For the description, see LANDMA RK BRIEFS AND\nARGUMENTS, supra n.1, 735-38.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 54\n\n\n         It fails as a matter of simple logic to take a splintered result striking down one policy and\nessentially to glean from it a holding that any policy that falls short of the original policy is\nconstitutional. Indeed, the Supreme Court has very recently warned courts of appeals against similar\nthinking. In United States v. Knights, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118468\"><a href=\"/opinion/118468/united-states-v-knights/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct. at 590. In rejecting the Ninth Circuit’s gloss on Griffin, the Court called it “dubious logic —\nthat an opinion upholding the constitutionality of a particular search implicitly holds unconstitutional\nany search that is not like it.” Ibid. (emphasis added). In effect, the majority of this court today\nsimilarly holds incorrectly that an opinion denying the legality of a particular policy implicitly holds\nconstitutional every policy that falls in the slightest degree short of the evils that were condemned\nin the first case.\n\n        The court does this by going past the general, and thus unhelpful, propositions actually agreed\nto by a majority of the Court in Bakke and adopting and even expanding as the holding of the case\nevery nuance of the opinion written by Justice Powell. In Part IV-D of his opinion, Justice Powell\nstated that race can be used as a factor in admissions decisions in order to further the objective of\ndiversity in an academic setting because the state has a compelling interest in achieving a diverse\nstudent body. No other Justice joined that Part. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-15. In Part V-A of his\nopinion, Justice Powell set out as a model of a constitutional plan a race-based admissions plan\nutilized by Harvard University, in which race was utilized as a “plus” factor that could “tip the\nbalance” in an applicant’s favor. No other Justice joined that Part. Id. at 315-20. The majority of\nthis court holds that these are the precedential holdings to be found in the case because, by reading\nBakke through the – in this case easily manipulated – lens of Marks, the court has determined that\na certain reading of the language of Justice Powell’s opinion represents the holding of the Bakke\nCourt.\n\nB. Bakke and Marks\n\n       1. Marks\n\n       Marks was an appeal from a conviction for transporting obscene materials in interstate\ncommerce. The defendant challenged the use of a jury instruction defining obscene material that\ncame from a Supreme Court case decided after the time of the defendant’s conduct, Miller v.\nCalifornia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108838\"><a href=\"/opinion/108838/miller-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). The defendant alleged that the new definition expanded the scope\nof prohibited conduct, and therefore could not be applied in his case without violating his Due\nProcess rights. The Court therefore needed to determine what the operative definition of obscene\nmaterial was before Miller.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 55\n\n\n         The problem was that in the last obscenity case decided by the Court before Miller, Memoirs\nv. Massachusetts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107187\"><a href=\"/opinion/107187/book-named-john-clelands-memoirs-of-a-woman-of-pleasure-v-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966), no opinion garnered a majority. In fact, the Court in\nMemoirs was deeply fragmented, and it was not facially clear that there was one definition for what\nconstituted obscene material that could be derived from the various opinions. Two Justices\nexpressed the view that all sexually explicit material was entitled to full First Amendment protection.\nId. at 421 (Black, dissenting). One Justice believed that only “hard core pornography” was\nunprotected. Id. at 425 (Stewart, dissenting). Three Justices joining a plurality opinion opined most\nimportantly that material must be “utterly without redeeming social value” before it will be stripped\nof First Amendment protection. Id. at 418. The remaining three Justices, writing in various dissents,\nwould have set the bar lower for defining material as obscene. Id. at 443 (Clark, dissenting), 454-56\n(Harlan, dissenting), 460-61 (White, dissenting).\n\n        The Court in Marks, viewing the divided landscape of Memoirs, stated famously that “[w]hen\na fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of\nfive Justices, ‘the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who\nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.’” Marks, 430 U.S. at 193 (quoting Gregg v.\nGeorgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109532\"><a href=\"/opinion/109532/gregg-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 169 n.15 (1976)). In Marks itself, it was clear that the Memoirs plurality\ndecision represented the narrowest grounds for the holding, as the plurality would have struck down\nthe fewest state and federal statutes defining materials as obscene.\n\n        Taken on its face, Marks might be read only for the limited proposition that a criminal\ndefendant cannot be held liable for conduct that he did not have fair notice would be prohibited. Id.\nat 192-93. However, Marks has been read much more broadly, to provide a basis for discerning the\nholding of the Court in circumstances where a majority of the Justices agree on an outcome but not\non a rationale for the outcome.

Netherland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118131\"><a href=\"/opinion/118131/odell-v-netherland/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 160 (1997) (utilizing\nMarks analysis to discern a holding in Gardner v.

The Problematic Application of Marks to Bakke\n\n        In applying Marks to the various opinions in Bakke, the majority contends that Justice\nPowell’s opinion is necessarily the holding of the Court, because he concurred in the judgment of\nthe Court on the narrowest grounds. Powell, applying strict scrutiny, held that the UC Davis\naffirmative action program was unconstitutional, but also asserted that race could be taken into\naccount in admissions decisions in certain circumstances, namely to promote diversity. Bakke, 438\nU.S. at 314-15. Justice Stevens, in an opinion joined by three other Justices, did not reach the\nconstitutional issue but concurred in the judgment on the basis that race could never be used without\nviolating Title VI. Id. at 408-21. Justice Brennan, concurring in part and dissenting in part and\njoined by three other Justices, would have upheld UC Davis’s program, subjecting it only to\nintermediate scrutiny. Id. at 362. Justice Brennan wrote that race could be used in admissions\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 56\n\n\nprograms “to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice, at least when\nappropriate findings have been made by judicial, legislative, or administrative bodies with\ncompetence to act in this area.” Id. at 325. As such, Justice Brennan and the three Justices joining\nhis opinion concurred with Justice Powell’s judgment overturning the California Supreme Court’s\nruling that race could never be used in admissions programs, but would have found UC Davis’s\nprogram constitutional on the basis that it sought to remedy past discrimination and so dissented\nfrom Justice Powell’s holding on that score.\n\n        Since Justice Brennan would have applied intermediate scrutiny to “benign” racial\nclassifications, whereas Justice Powell would have applied strict scrutiny to all racial classifications,\nthe majority holds that Justice Powell’s diversity rationale in Bakke is binding precedent.\nSpecifically, they explain that “[b]ecause the set of constitutionally permissible racial classifications\nunder intermediate scrutiny, by definition, includes those classifications constitutionally permissible\nunder strict scrutiny, Justice Powell’s rationale would permit the most limited consideration of race;\ntherefore, it is Bakke’s narrowest rationale.” Majority Op. at 9. In other words, the majority sees\nJustice Powell’s reasoning as a subset of Justice Brennan’s, and therefore reasons it to be the binding\nholding of Bakke, as Marks instructs us to glean it. There are, however, two fundamental problems\nwith this argument.\n\n        First, the majority’s analysis inverts the concept of “narrowness” in Marks. In Marks, the\nMemoirs plurality opinion was “narrowest” because its interpretation of the First Amendment\ninvalidated a smaller set of laws. Marks, 430 U.S. at 193. In other words, the “narrower” opinion\nwas that which construed the constitutional provision in question less potently. In Bakke, Justice\nBrennan’s opinion, by adopting intermediate scrutiny, would invalidate fewer racial preference\npolicies than Justice Powell’s opinion which, through strict scrutiny, would invalidate more. Yet\nthe majority applies its own concept of narrowness, with no grounding in Marks, and holds that the\nopinion that creates the more powerful Fourteenth Amendment is indeed the narrower.\n\n        Second, the fact that Justice Powell’s reasoning on standards (that strict scrutiny should be\nused to evaluate the constitutionality of all racial preferences) is a subset of Justice Brennan’s\n(applying merely intermediate scrutiny) tells us nothing about the first question before this court\ntoday: whether diversity is a compelling state interest. At most, it might tell us that if the question\nbefore this court were whether to apply intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny to our analysis of the\nLaw School’s admissions program, the answer would be strict scrutiny. However, that question is\nnot before this court, because it has been conclusively answered, in favor of strict scrutiny. In\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 227, the Supreme Court held that all racial classifications are subject to strict\nscrutiny.\n\n       In trying to divine a holding from Bakke supporting the use of race for diversity purposes,\nwe are not able to apply Marks on a surface level, relying only on the fact that Justice Powell would\nhave applied a stricter standard of scrutiny to race-based classifications than would have Justice\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 57\n\n\nBrennan. The unavailability of a “surface-level” application of Marks may itself be dispositive.\nAfter all, Marks is merely a tool with which to determine the collective intent of a fractured court.\nBecause the first-level Marks analysis has been displaced by intervening precedent, perhaps the\napplication of Marks to the still-open questions raised by the Powell and Brennan opinions in Bakke\ncan no longer serve its intended purpose of deriving the collective intent of the Court, as the\nassumptions of the Justices deciding Bakke no longer hold.\n\n        The application of Marks to Bakke is also inapt because (1) the separate opinions in Bakke\ndo not constitute a coherent set and subset of each other and cannot be placed on a logical\ncontinuum; (2) the application of Marks really yields two Marks holdings from Bakke; and (3) the\nSupreme Court and other courts have recognized that Bakke does not yield a useful holding on the\nconstitutionally permissible use of race and that Marks ought not be applied in the circumstances that\nobtain here.\n\n        a. No Set and Subset or Continuum Available in Bakke\n\n        Nevertheless, if we are still to use the Marks apparatus, we need to examine the specific\nrationales offered by Justices Powell and Brennan to determine whether it is possible, in this court’s\nwords, to characterize one Justice’s rationale supporting the judgment as a “coherent subset of the\nprinciples articulated” by the other’s rationale. Triplett Grille v. City of Akron, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682462\"><a href=\"/opinion/682462/triplett-grille-inc-dba-the-back-door-v-city-of-akron/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134 (6th\nCir. 1994).\n\n       There are potentially two judgments in Bakke. One struck down UC Davis’s admissions\nprogram. The second purported to overturn an injunction against all use of race, after discussing\npossible permissible bases for utilizing race in admissions decisions. With respect to the latter issue,\nthe majority in its Marks analysis defines the judgment as stating that race can be used in certain\ncircumstances by educational institutions.5 See Majority Op. at 6.\n\n       In order to view the rationale of Justice Powell’s concurrence as the narrowest grounds in\nsupport of this judgment, the court must read Justice Powell as embracing the use of race only for\n\n\n        5\n        The majority quotes from Section V-C of Justice Powell’s opinion, which was joined by the\nBrennan group and which states:\n       In enjoining petitioner from ever considering the race of any applicant, however, the\n       courts below failed to recognize that the State has a substantial interest that\n       legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the\n       competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin. For this reason, so much of the\n       California court's judgment as enjoins petitioner from any consideration of the race\n       of any applicant must be reversed.\n438 U.S. at 320 (emphasis added).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 58\n\n\nthe limited purpose of promoting diversity, while Justice Brennan would have permitted the use of\nrace more broadly, to promote diversity and to remedy past discrimination. On its face, Justice\nBrennan’s writing in Bakke does not support the use of race for both diversity and remedial purposes.\nNowhere in Justice Brennan’s opinion does he mention the diversity rationale, and he explicitly did\nnot join Part IV-D of Justice Powell’s opinion, discussing the diversity rationale. Further, as\nmentioned above, Justice Brennan clearly states that “the central meaning of today’s opinions” is that\n“[g]overnment may take race into account when it acts not to demean or insult any racial group, but\nto remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 325\n(emphasis added). Finally, in his now-famous first footnote, Justice Brennan, writing for himself\nand the three other Justices who joined his opinion, agrees that a plan like the Harvard plan set out\nas a model by Justice Powell would be “constitutional under our approach, at least so long as the use\nof race to achieve an integrated student body is necessitated by the lingering effects of past\ndiscrimination.” Id. at 326 n.1 (emphasis added).6\n\n        If one reads Justice Brennan’s opinion as approving the use of race for remedial purposes,\nbut not for diversity, one could make the argument that Justice Powell’s opinion, which accepts the\ngeneral concept of a diversity rationale, is broader than Justice Brennan’s, which accepts only a more\nspecific “past discrimination” rationale. Indeed, in a world permitting the use of race in admissions\ndecisions when it is used to promote diversity, educational institutions would merely have to place\na label on their actions in order to pass constitutional muster. There is no facial limit on the use or\n\n\n        6\n          A normal reading of this sentence would be that if the policy in question were necessitated\nby the lingering effects of past discrimination, the Brennan group would hold it constitutional.\nTherefore, if the policy were not so necessitated, one might argue by expressio unius that the\nBrennan group would hold it unconstitutional; at most one might argue that they would be wholly\nagnostic on the constitutionality of such a policy. However, the majority’s grammatical\ndeconstruction, arguing that the footnote somehow provides affirmative support for the proposition\nthat diversity is a compelling state interest, simply does not bear examination. Majority Op. at 10.\nIt is quite correct, as the majority points out, that “at least so long as” does not mean “only if.” Ibid.\nHowever, it does mean “if,” which is all that is necessary to show that the Brennan concurrence –\nwhile not affirmatively rejecting the Powell diversity rationale – certainly did not endorse it.\n         Further, the majority’s attempt to distinguish between the language modifying when race may\nbe used and why it may be used adds nothing, because a temporal qualifier at least hints at some\nreasoning related to that limitation. If I am told I can only buy beer between the hours of nine and\nfive, it may be because those are the hours when liquor stores are open, or it may be because of state\nlegislation limiting beer sales, or it may be because liquor store owners fear shoplifting at other\nhours; however, each of these rationales is related in a causal way to the time limitation. In just the\nsame way, it may be that Justice Brennan really meant only that race could be used when\n“necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination,” but this is still a qualification on the\nscope of Justice Powell’s diversity rationale.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 59\n\n\nthe ends of a race-based admissions policy seeking “diversity.” The remedial rationale, on the other\nhand, would at least require some proof of past discrimination, and it would provide an obvious\nendpoint for the program, namely when that past discrimination has been remedied.\n\n        At the very least, however, since Justice Powell rejected the past discrimination rationale and\nJustice Brennan can be read to have implicitly rejected the diversity rationale, there is no continuum\nto be found in Bakke; instead of a broader holding and a narrower holding, what we might have are\ntwo different and non-comparable holdings. If such a reading is adopted, the “holding” that the\nmajority of this court has divined from the Supreme Court’s Bakke decision is a rationale set out by\none Justice and rejected by eight. See Cass R. Sunstein, Public Deliberation, Affirmative Action, and\nthe Supreme Court, 84 Calif. L. Rev. 1179, 1185 (1996) (noting that the “rule” in Bakke represented\nthe thought of just one Justice, while “[t]he other eight participating justices explicitly rejected that\nrule”). This hardly can be consistent with the letter or the spirit of Marks.7\n\n         Viewing the rationales for the use of race put forth by the Bakke concurrences not as a\ncontinuum (or a set and subset), but as several distinct and unrelated justifications, is one of the ways\none might argue that Marks simply does not apply to Bakke. Indeed, this is precisely what the\ndistrict court held in the present case. See Grutter v.

The Potential for Two Marks Holdings\n\n        Even if one gets past the conceptual hurdle of treating as a continuum (or a set and subset)\ntwo rationales that are not clearly related in scope, it is not clear that a Marks analysis of the\nrationales in Bakke would produce the holding that the majority claims it does.\n\n        As mentioned, the majority defines the relevant judgment in Bakke abstractly, as holding that\nrace can sometimes be used by educational institutions. Until now, we have assumed that the\njudgment in Bakke is as the majority defines it. Rather than adopting a broad statement providing\nno real guidance on when race can be used and for what purposes, we might look at what the two\nopinions that concur on the possibility of a constitutional use of race have to say about each of the\ntwo potential rationales, namely remedying past discrimination and diversity. If we do this, we are\nessentially left with two holdings in Bakke on the permissible rationales for the use of race: one\nholding permitting the use of race for diversity purposes sometimes and one permitting it for\nremedial purposes sometimes.8 See generally Lackland H. Bloom, Jr., Hopwood, Bakke and the\nFuture of the Diversity Justification, 29 Tex. Tech. L. Rev. 1, 30-32 (1998).\n\n        Justice Powell’s decision would be the narrowest grounds to support the holding that race\ncan sometimes be used to remedy the effects of past discrimination. This is because the Brennan\ngroup would have allowed the use of race whenever there is a “sound basis for believing that the\nproblem of underrepresentation of minorities . . . [is] attributable to handicaps imposed on minority\napplicants by past and present racial discrimination.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 369. On the other hand,\nJustice Powell expressed a more limited view of the permissible use of race in this regard in Section\nIV-B of his opinion. He agreed that “[t]he State certainly has a legitimate and substantial interest\nin ameliorating, or eliminating where feasible, the disabling effects of identified discrimination.” Id.\nat 306. However, Justice Powell would not have permitted simple reliance on general past\n\n\n       8\n         The majority contends that by redefining the relevant judgment I impermissibly “cobble\ntogether a holding from various rationales in the discrete Bakke opinions.” See Majority Op. at 9 n.6.\nHowever, the majority misunderstands my aim. I am not suggesting we apply Marks to a given\njudgment and then pick and choose among the rationales to support that judgment. Instead, I am\nmerely suggesting an analytical tool whereby we more accurately define the relevant holding before\napplying Marks. By defining the holding as stating that race can be used to promote diversity\nsometimes, I illustrate that Justice Brennan’s rationale is the narrowest in support of that holding and\nin so doing call into question the premise that Marks provides an answer to the threshold question\nfacing this court.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 62\n\n\ndiscrimination, but instead would have required specific findings by a competent government body\nthat the use of race is “responsive to identified discrimination” before race could be used remedially\nin admissions decisions. Id. at 310.\n\n        However, with respect to the redefined holding discussing diversity, the one relevant in this\ncase, Justice Brennan’s opinion facially is the narrower. Justice Powell wrote broadly in his Section\nIV-D that “[t]he attainment of a diverse student body clearly is a constitutionally permissible goal\nfor an institution of higher education.” Id. at 312. Later, Powell wrote again that “the interest of\ndiversity is compelling in the context of a university's admissions program.” Id. at 314. Justice\nBrennan, on the other hand, specifically added a restriction to his expressed agreement. As discussed\nabove, Justice Brennan would be willing to support the diversity rationale embodied in the Harvard\ndiversity program set out by Justice Powell as a model, “at least so long as the use of race to achieve\nan integrated student body is necessitated by the lingering effects of past discrimination.” Bakke,\n438 U.S. at 326 n.1. Since it put a limit on the utility of diversity as a rationale supporting the\nconstitutionally permissible use of race in admissions programs where Justice Powell’s opinion\nexpressed no limit, Justice Brennan’s opinion is narrower than Justice Powell’s on the use of race\nto encourage diversity. So by merely redefining the relevant holding more accurately, I have reached\na result opposite that of the majority – Justice Brennan’s rationale becomes the narrower and\ntherefore becomes the Marks holding to be gleaned from Bakke on the diversity issue. This further\nshows the error in relying on Marks to answer the question before this court.\n\n        The above discussion is intended simply to illustrate that reasonable minds can and do differ\non the holding, if any, to be found in Bakke with respect to the diversity rationale. Those holding\ndifferent views on the subject could go back and forth endlessly, with no clear resolution. The\nreason for this – as almost all, wherever they stand on the argument, would agree – is that we are\ntrying to divine a clear holding from a decidedly unclear decision.\n\n        In this circumstance, the better view is that Marks simply fails to extract from Bakke a\nholding on the constitutionality of the diversity rationale. Indeed, the very fact that one must struggle\nto find a way to fit the Court’s Bakke writings into the Marks mold counsels against finding such a\nholding in Bakke.\n\n        c. Subsequent Treatment of Bakke and Marks\n\n       It is apparent that the Supreme Court has doubted that Bakke provided a holding beyond the\nobvious one that UC Davis’s system was illegal.9 Though only writing for four Justices, Justice\n\n\n        9\n         The majority finds support for its proposition that diversity is a compelling state interest in\nthe fact that Justice Brennan in Metro Broadcasting cited Bakke for the proposition that “‘a diverse\nstudent body’ contributing to a ‘robust exchange of ideas’ is a ‘constitutionally permissible goal’ on\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 63\n\n\nBrennan wrote in the introduction to his Bakke concurrence that “[t]he difficulty of the issue\npresented . . . and the mature consideration which each of our Brethren has brought to it have\nresulted in many opinions, no single one speaking for the Court.” 438 U.S. at 324. Two years later,\nin the course of examining a minority business provision in the Public Works Employment Act of\n1977, the Court expressly refused to adopt “the formulas of analysis” set out in Bakke and did not\ndiscuss any holding coming from the case, but instead set out to show that the challenged provision\n“would survive judicial review under either ‘test’ articulated in the several Bakke opinions.”\nFullilove v.

Aside from the fact that Justice\nBrennan was applying intermediate scrutiny in Metro Broadcasting and therefore his views on the\nconstitutionality of any policy or rationale would not speak to the present case where strict scrutiny\nis the standard, the statement is – as the majority itself notes – merely dicta. The majority attempts\nto salvage the usefulness of the statement to their argument by describing it is as “persuasive\nauthority, which this court may not ignore.” Majority Op. at 11. Of course, this court ignores (or\nat least does not rule in accordance with) persuasive authority all the time. In particular, an ex post\nexegesis written by a different Justice of another Justice’s opinion that did not prevail on the point\nat issue is hardly the strongest type of persuasive authority.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 64\n\n\nviable the argument that Justice Powell’s rationale represented Bakke’s holding regarding the\ndiversity issue under Marks, while the other district court found Marks inapplicable.\n\nC. The Dicta Problem\n\n       Lastly, I pause to point out that, even if the majority’s application of Marks were correct, it\nwould not be clear that the various discussions of permissible rationales to be found in Justices\nPowell and Brennan’s opinions are anything more than non-binding dicta. This is because there is\nan argument that Bakke does not have a “judgment” with respect to the permissible use of race in\neducational institutions’ admissions policies, so there would be no Marks holding on that issue.\n\n        In order to understand the argument, it needs to be noted again that there were potentially two\nissues in Bakke – (1) whether state universities could use race at all in their admissions decisions,\nand (2) whether the university’s particular use of race was permissible. Justice Powell’s opinion\nstated the judgment of the Court on the first issue, because he was joined by Brennan’s group of four\nto make a majority for the proposition that state universities were not completely precluded from the\nuse of race. Justice Powell’s opinion stated the judgment of the Court on the second issue, because\nhe was joined by the other four Justices in finding that UC Davis’s particular system was\nimpermissible.\n\n        In his Bakke concurrence and dissent, Justice Stevens argued that Justice Powell’s discussion\nof the first issue was merely dicta, as the California Supreme Court did nothing more than strike\ndown UC Davis’s program and neither had before it nor decided the question of whether state\nuniversities could ever use race.

Therefore, once the Court ordered\nBakke admitted, he no longer had any interest in UC Davis’s future admissions policy. Ibid.\nAccordingly, Justice Stevens argued that the only judgment of the Court was that UC Davis’s system\nwas impermissible, and the narrowest grounds for holding that would seem to be Justice Stevens’s\nfinding that the system was impermissible under Title VI (due to the long-standing rule, cited by\nJustice Stevens, that the Court avoids constitutional issues if a case can fairly be decided on a\nstatutory ground).

See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 271 n.1 (Powell, concurring),\n325 (Brennan, concurring). Specifically, Justice Powell pointed out that the University had cross\nclaimed in the trial court for a declaratory judgment that its program was constitutional, but that it\nhad lost. See id. at 271 n.1. Presumably, then, Justice Powell was arguing that unlike Bakke, the\nUniversity had an ongoing interest in the content of its future policies. Further, Justice Powell\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 65\n\n\nargued that the California Supreme Court effectively enjoined the University from ever using race.\nJustice Powell quoted language from the California Supreme Court to the effect that UC Davis’s\nadmissions policy was constitutionally impermissible to the extent that it was “utilized in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner.” Ibid., quoting </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1267759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1267759/bakke-v-regents-of-university-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1166 (Cal. 1976) (footnote omitted).\n\n         At least one commentator has challenged Justice Powell’s contention that the Bakke\ndiscussion on the more general use of race represents a holding. See Maltz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Okla.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. at 130\nn.91 (arguing that this portion of the Bakke decision is merely dicta). Maltz points out that while it\nis true that UC Davis cross claimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that its policies were legal, it\ndid not request that the court in the alternative instruct it how to conform its policies to the law.\nInstead, according to Maltz, once the Court determined that UC Davis’s plan was infirm, it by\nimplication disposed of the cross-claim and had fulfilled its function as a reviewing court. Ibid.\nFurther, as Maltz points out, while the California Supreme Court did use the sweeping language cited\nby Justice Powell for the proposition that the court had enjoined any future use of race, the judgment\nof the California court was much narrower and included no such injunction. See 553 P.2d at 1172.\n\n        More fundamentally, the holding/dicta distinction demands that we consider binding only\nthat which was necessary to resolve the question before the Court. At most, the question before the\nCourt in Bakke was whether race could ever be used in admissions decisions. To resolve that\nquestion, the Court only needed to answer that race could potentially be used. Any speculation\nregarding the circumstances under which race could be used was little more than an advisory\nopinion, as those circumstances were not before the court and need not be validated to overturn an\ninjunction barring any use of race, to the extent one was in place.\n\n        So, if we admit that a Marks analysis simply does not provide a binding holding on the\ndiversity issue, we are left with precedent striking down UC Davis’s admissions system and either\nbinding precedent or persuasive support (depending on whether one agrees with Justice Stevens’s\nargument in Bakke that the entire rationale discussion was dicta) for the proposition embodied in\nSection V-C of Justice Powell’s opinion, to which a majority of the Justices did subscribe, that “the\nState has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions\nprogram involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.” 438 U.S. at 320.\nUnfortunately, we are not reviewing the UC Davis program, and the fact that a state has a\n“substantial interest” that “may” be constitutionally served by admissions programs utilizing race\ndoes not help us. We must determine whether the state has a “compelling interest” rather than a\n“substantial interest” and the fact that an interest “may” be served by a race-based system does\nnothing to tell us “how” it may be.\n\nD. Intervening Supreme Court Precedent\n\n       Having held that Marks does not compel a Bakke holding, the district court in this case\nreviewed recent Supreme Court cases that have addressed racial classifications, and held that\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 66\n\n\ntogether they make clear that “racial classifications are unconstitutional unless they are intended to\nremedy carefully documented effects of past discrimination.” Grutter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2472469\"><a href=\"/opinion/2472469/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849\n(E.D. Mich. 2001). The court found this holding to be required by two Supreme Court cases. First,\nthe court cited Adarand Constructors v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227 (1995), where the Court held that\nall racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny and overturned Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.\nFCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112484\"><a href=\"/opinion/112484/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), to the extent that it applied intermediate scrutiny to a plan that used racial\nclassifications in awarding broadcast licenses in order to enhance broadcast diversity. Second, the\ncourt noted that in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493 (1989), the Court stated that:\n“Classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for\nremedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial\nhostility.”10\n\n        Taking together the Court’s overturning of the standard used to uphold the use of race to\nencourage diversity in Metro Broadcasting (thereby calling into question the permissibility of using\nrace for diversity purposes) and its statement in Croson that race should only be used for remedial\nsettings, the district court held that the only permissible use of race under strict scrutiny is to “remedy\ncarefully documented effects of past discrimination,” and that since the diversity rationale proffered\nby the Law School was not tied to remedying past discrimination, it is an impermissible basis for the\nuse of race. Grutter, 137 F. Supp. 2d at 849.\n\n        The majority, as it does in the rest of its opinion, disregards the district court’s analysis by\nadherence to the mantra of a Bakke holding that diversity is a permissible rationale for the use of\nrace. Accordingly, the majority states that the later Supreme Court cases pointed to by the district\ncourt can not possibly stand for the proposition the court said they do because that would require a\nfinding that the Supreme Court silently overturned its holding in Bakke. As the majority points out,\nthe Court has instructed lower courts not to find that it has implicitly overruled itself, but to let it do\nits own overruling. Majority Op. at 11. See also Agostini v. Feldman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118133\"><a href=\"/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237 (1997).\nHowever, application of Agostini requires first that the Supreme Court have made a holding that a\nlower court is finding it to have implicitly overruled; in this case, Bakke provides no such holding.\n\n         While I find persuasive the district court’s attempt to derive from the Supreme Court’s\nAdarand and Croson decisions a holding that diversity is not a permissible rationale, it would be\nsomewhat disingenuous of me to fault the majority of this court for divining a firm and binding\nholding from Bakke while urging the court to do the same from Adarand and Croson. While the\ndistrict court’s reading of these two cases is far from clearly wrong, it is also not required. In\n\n\n        10\n          Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices White and Kennedy joined this part of Justice\nO’Connor’s plurality opinion. Justice Scalia agreed that the use of race is only appropriate for\nremedial situations, but wrote separately to contend that it was appropriate only in a more limited\nset of situations than those approved by the plurality. See 488 U.S. at 735 (Scalia, concurring).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 67\n\n\nAdarand, the Court overturned Metro Broadcasting to the extent that it utilized intermediate scrutiny\nin reviewing a classification plan intended to promote diversity. However, the Court did not\nexplicitly state that diversity would not withstand strict scrutiny. Further, in Croson, while a\nmajority of the Court could be read to suggest that only remedial justifications would be permissible,\na diversity rationale was not at issue in the case.\n\n        A better approach is simply to address the diversity rationale on the merits. Accordingly, I\nwill seek to apply on the merits the rule on which we can all agree, as set forth by the Court in\nAdarand, and look to see (1) if the use of race in admissions for diversity purposes serves a\ncompelling governmental interest, and (2) whether the Law School’s plan is narrowly tailored to\nachieve that interest. Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227.\n\nII. On the Merits\n\n       Symptomatic of its deference to the advisory opinion of one Justice of the United States\nSupreme Court, the majority has given us no argument as to why the engineering of a diverse student\nbody should be a compelling state interest sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny. I, however, consider\nthe arguments on both sides of this question below and conclude that constructing a diverse\neducational environment is not a compelling state interest. In explaining my conclusion below, I\nanalyze why the nature and benefits of the experiential “diversity” that the Law School claims\nultimately to seek is conceptually disconnected from the racial and ethnic diversity that it primarily\nseeks. I also demonstrate that the Law School’s concept of diversity permits no logical limitation\nand threatens to justify even more constitutionally unacceptable outcomes, counseling against\nrecognizing its achievement as a compelling state purpose.\n\n        If I were deciding this case for a majority, I likely would not have resolved the question of\nwhether developing a diverse student body is a compelling state interest. Even if a racial\nclassification is designed to achieve a compelling state interest, it must be narrowly tailored to that\ninterest. While I could conceive of racial preferences in admission that are narrowly tailored to\nachieve some diversity in education, the Law School’s plan is not among those. The majority\nappears satisfied that the Law School’s program is narrowly tailored because the Law School has not\narticulated a precise numerical target for admitted minorities. By carefully avoiding the pernicious\nterm “quota,” the Law School, for the majority, has withstood the constitutional strict scrutiny that\nwe apply to racial preferences. For me, however, the Law School’s simple avoidance of an explicit\nnumerical target does not meet the constitutional requirements of narrow tailoring. The Law\nSchool’s efforts to achieve a “critical mass” are functionally indistinguishable from a numerical\nquota.\n\n        Moreover, the constitutional inquiry into narrow tailoring is not merely one into the form of\nthe racial preference. The sheer magnitude of the Law School’s racial preference, a feature left\ncompletely unexamined by the majority, is simply too large to be considered narrowly tailored. Even\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 68\n\n\n“the Harvard Plan,” which the majority remarkably considers constitutional merely because Justice\nPowell in Bakke speculated that it might be constitutional, does not validate the amount of the Law\nSchool’s racial preference.\n\n        I discuss the two parts of the strict scrutiny analysis – the existence of a compelling state\ninterest and the employment of only those means narrowly tailored to that purpose – separately\nbelow.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 69\n\n\nA. Is Developing a Diverse Student Body a Compelling State Interest?\n\n        1. The Nature of “Diversity”\n\n        Holding that, generally speaking, “diversity in education” is a compelling state interest would\nnot be terribly helpful. After all, it is not clear what the term means. From the outset therefore, it\nis crucial to be precise about the nature of the “diversity” that the Law School seeks to promote.\nJustice Powell discussed a diversity that would enrich the pedagogical activities of a school, a\ndiversity of “experiences, outlooks, and ideas” that would challenge its students’ settled\npreconceptions and open them to new intellectual paradigms. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314. The Law\nSchool adopts this dialogic vision of diversity as the purpose behind its admissions program.\n\n        Some versions of diversity are clearly not included in the Law School’s vision. For example,\nthe Law School does not seem to promote the potential for moral education in racial tolerance\ncreated by a more diverse student body. On this view, the mere presence of minority students may\nindeed be sufficient to enhance the educational experience. Similarly, the Law School does not seem\nto rely on the promotion of post-graduation diversity in the legal profession.\n\n       Instead, the Law School rests its claim to the benefits of a diverse student body on the unique\nexperiences that students from under-represented groups will be able to share with their fellow\nstudents. Closely related, the Law School implies that a student body diverse with regard to race is\none diverse with regard to viewpoint, experience, and opinion. Through the Socratic Method, the\nkeystone of legal education, the students from groups otherwise “over-represented” will be pressed\nto consider new ideas as their previously under-represented minority colleagues discuss the legal\nquestions at issue.\n\n         For all these educational benefits to diversity, the majority uses the shorthand “academic\ndiversity.” Majority Op. at 15. From the implementation of the Law School’s program, however,\nit is perfectly clear that academics has nothing to do with the type of diversity sought. After listening\nto the Law School extoll the virtues of educational diversity, one might think that preference would\nbe given across the board for “life experiences.” The Law School’s rhetoric implies that it is\nsearching tirelessly for the applicant with the most unique of experiences: for example, the Mormon\nmissionary in Uganda, the radical libertarian or Marxist, the child of subsistence farmers in\nArkansas, or perhaps the professional jazz musician. The Law School, however, never claims that\nthere is any similarity between the preference given to those with such unique experiences and that\nbestowed upon those it considers “under-represented” racial minorities.\n\n        Most poignantly, the Law School’s offering of non-racial exemplars for such non-racial\ndiversity betrays the profound and experientially unrelated preference that the Law School places on\nrace. Mentioning status as an under-represented minority in the same breath, the Law School\ngeneralizes, in the abstract, that it would also give a preference to an applicant with “an Olympic\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 70\n\n\ngold medal, a Ph.D in physics, the attainment of age 50 in a class otherwise lacking anyone over 30,\nor the experience of having been a Vietnamese boat person.” Admissions Policies, University of\nMichigan Law School, April 22, 1992, JA at 4240. Yet to equate bare racial status with the\nexperiential gains of these generally remarkable (and exceedingly rare) achievements demonstrates\nthat the Law School’s desired diversity is unrelated to the experiences of its applicants. After\nreading the description of its admissions criteria, a Michigan law student might yearn to meet the\nmere Olympian who failed to medal and was thus considered insufficiently interesting by the Law\nSchool.\n\n        The disjunction between the Law School’s preference for the race of “under-represented\nminorities” and what happened to be those applicants’ experiences came through very clearly in an\nexchange at oral argument. Counsel for the Law School agreed that it was true that Ms. Grutter\nwould have been admitted had she been of a different race, but strongly asserted that she would have\nthen been “a different person.” Tr. at 38. Of course, in a trivial way, that is true of every change in\nany of us. Had she grown up in New York or had a mother or father who did or did not work outside\nthe home, she would also have been a different person. However, none of those changes, all of\nwhich would have made her “diverse” in some different fashion, would have enhanced or determined\nher chances of admission. When I then asked counsel whether, if she were of a different race, she\nwould have been admitted whether she had come of age in inner-city Detroit or in Grosse Pointe, he\nanswered: “That’s probably right.” Id. at 39.\n\n         When it comes to a choice between admitting a conventionally liberal (or conventionally\nconservative) black student who is the child of lawyer parents living in Grosse Pointe, just like the\nprevious ten white admittees, the black student will be given a diversity preference that would not\nbe given to a white or Asian student, her unique experiences notwithstanding.11 Similarly, it is not\nat all clear how true diversity is served by giving massive preference to a student whose parents or\ngrandparents came from an upper-class suburb of Buenos Aires, over those whose grandparents\nimmigrated from similar areas of Paris, Munich, or Tokyo or, indeed, over a person whose\ngrandparents survived the labor camps of Hitler or Stalin or the conformity regime of Brezhnev’s\nKazakhstan. Even Justice Powell in his Bakke opinion recognized that an admissions program\n“focused solely on ethnic diversity, would hinder rather than further attainment of genuine diversity.”\n Bakke, 438 U.S. at 315 (Powell, concurring).\n\n       Perhaps the one unifying feature of the minority groups that the Law School heavily prefers\nin admissions is that they all, on average, have had some experience with being the object of racial\ndiscrimination. For law students, this might bring an understanding of the purposes behind the anti-\ndiscrimination laws that they might study. It is hard, however, to believe that the Law School’s\n\n\n       11\n         With respect to the concurring opinion’s criticism of this example, Concurring Op. at n.3\n(Clay), see n.21 infra.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 71\n\n\nadmissions scheme is terribly sensitive to this interest. If the Law School were truly interested in\nthose with profound experience with discrimination, it would be sensitive to differences within the\naffected groups. An African-American applicant who comes to the Law School by way of Choate\nand Harvard12 may well have quite a different experience of discrimination than one from a rural\npublic school. Even if one were to believe that the Law School’s racial preference were carefully\ndesigned to add such experience to the Law School mixing pot, one could wonder why an experience\nwith discrimination would be so much more important than any other experience germane to other\nlegal issues.\n\n        Indeed, one should wonder why race is at all relevant to the Law School if it only is\nconcerned about the diversity of experience. It is likely that an admissions scheme that sought true\nexperiential diversity, without regard to race, would provide some systematic advantage for racial\nor ethnic minorities. See also Part II.B.4 (discussing race-neutral means). Under-represented life\nexperiences – primary or secondary education at an under-funded public school, struggling with\nrelative poverty, a childhood spent in urban rather than suburban areas – may correlate to some\ndegree with under-represented racial or ethnic minorities.13\n\n        Such a system of seeking experiential diversity would be unlikely to raise significant\nconstitutional problems, unless it were clear that an institution manipulated these factors to admit\nmembers of a particular race. However, the Law School certainly does not seek to implement an\nexperientially based admissions system or even to assert that if it did, the preference given for such\nfactors could explain its current results. Instead, it is clear that the only type of diversity that is given\nmore than modest, if any, weight is based on assigned racial categories. The Law School cannot\nplausibly maintain that the system would be impractical, especially because, as they elsewhere\nremind us for purposes of distinguishing its preference from a quota, only one admissions officer\nreads all applications, makes all decisions, and therefore is capable of considering candidates\nindividually. The possibility of an experientially based admissions system and the Law School’s\napparent disinterest in such a system, indicate that the Law School grants preference to race, not as\na proxy for a unique set of experiences, but as a proxy for race itself.\n\n\n\n\n        12\n         Indeed, it is likely such minorities – those who have been relatively well-educated at elite\nschools, but who have not performed terribly well there – that the Law School’s preference policy\nmost benefits.\n        13\n          In fact, these factors may also correlate to unrealized academic ability, if the student has not\nhad sufficient resources, educational or financial, to blossom intellectually. In this sense, an\nadmissions system truly sensitive to experiential diversity may also select the more intellectually\ntalented.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 72\n\n\n        Accordingly, even if we were to consider binding on this court Justice Powell’s opinion in\nBakke that the achievement of some form of diversity in education is a compelling state interest, we\nwould not ipso facto find compelling the type of diversity that the Law School apparently seeks. For\nJustice Powell in Bakke, race or ethnicity was only “one element in a range of factors” that an\neducational institution may consider to develop an experientially heterogeneous environment.\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 314. The Law School’s consideration of race, for the sake of race, is not the type\nof pedagogical diversity thought potentially compelling in Powell’s opinion.\n\n        There are yet more fundamental problems with the broad-brush rationale of diversity. The\nfundamental premise of our society is that each person is equally “diverse” exactly because of her\nequality before God and the law. The very words of the Declaration of Independence are: “All men\nare created equal . . . and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.” Thus, the\nstarting basis is one of equality, not of separately assigned categories that are used to measure\ndiversity. From that starting point, every person’s experiences are “diverse” from those of every\nother. The very measure of diversity as used by the University is to say that some of those\ndifferences do not count. Thus, to the Law School, ten under-represented-minority students, each\na child of two-parent lawyer families, are considered to be diverse, while children whose parents are\nChinese merchants, Japanese farmers, white steel workers, or any combinations of the above are all\nconsidered to be part of a homogeneous (and “over-represented”) mass. And, of course, that\ncategorization then strongly determines the odds of admission. A child with one parent of Chinese\nancestry and one of Chilean would find that his level of “diversity” depends wholly on whether the\nLaw School chooses to assign him based on one parent or the other.14\n\n         The Law School gives no explanation of how it defines the groups to be favored. This means\nthat ultimately it must make, on some basis, a decision on who is, and is not, an “African-American,\nHispanic, or Native American.” See JA at 1957 (discussing the groups to be favored). Such\njudgments, of course, have a long and sordid history. The classic Southern Rule was that any\nAfrican ancestry, or “one drop” of African blood, made one black.15 The Nazi Nuremberg laws\n\n\n\n       14\n          A personal observation makes clear for me the problematic nature of such definitions. My\ndaughter has one grandparent who was a Cuban immigrant, two grandparents of Russian Jewish\norigin, and one grandparent who could be characterized as a Euro-American mixture. I would hate\nto think that her life chances were significantly altered, favorably or unfavorably, because a\ngovernment body applied a “grandfather clause” that focused on one rather than another of her\ngrandparents.\n       15\n         For more on the one-drop rule, see A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. & F. Michael Higginbotham,\n“Yearning to Breathe Free”: Legal Barriers Against and Options in Favor of Liberty in Antebellum\nVirginia, 68 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1213, 1243 n.163 (1993).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 73\n\n\nmade the fatal decision turn on the number of Jewish grandparents.16 “Hispanic” background may,\nI suppose, depend on which side of a pass in the Pyrenees your great-grandfather came from. This\nChristmas, my wife and I received a card, containing a lovely picture of a friend and his spouse, their\ntwo children and their spouses, and four grandchildren. I asked a sample of people, in and out of my\nchambers, how many of the ten people in the picture should receive racial preference under\nMichigan’s policy. I received answers ranging from one to ten.\n\n         A moment’s contemplation of these examples shows another serious problem with\nMichigan’s policies. On the one hand, all the evidence is that race and ethnicity are considered on\nan “all or nothing” basis. But the actual experience, diverse or otherwise, of a person who is “one-\nhalf” or “one-quarter” of one ethnicity, is likely to be, on average, different from one whose ancestry\nis relatively uniform. On the other hand, to apply boldly a system of half- or quarter-credit for\nassigned status would reveal the racist nature of the system to a degree from which even its\nproponents would shrink.\n\n       Thus, even if we give full force to Justice Powell’s discussion of “the virtues of diversity,”\nthe Law School’s program provides the linguistic term, but not the substance.\n\n       2. No Logical Limitation\n\n        We are not completely at sea regarding how to discern a compelling state interest. The\nSupreme Court has consistently rejected those purposes that lack a “logical stopping point.” Croson,\n488 U.S. at 498; Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275 (1986) (plurality opinion). Such\nvague and ill-defined purposes, if considered compelling, would eviscerate the constitutional\nprotection that strict scrutiny provides. The two requirements of strict scrutiny – the identification\nof a compelling state interest and the use of only those means narrowly tailored to serve that interest\n– are designed to be independently meaningful rather than mere redundancies. Yet it is meaningless\nto require that a state narrowly tailor its suspect policies to a purpose that itself is poorly defined.\n\n        Requiring a well-defined purpose to be compelling reflects the Supreme Court’s judgment\nthat racial classifications ought to be used sparingly. The Law School’s repeated incantation of\n“developing a diverse student body” suffers from this vice of vagueness. These same words, together\nwith the discussion of promoting a more intriguing student body, could be used, and indeed have\nbeen used not invalidly on their face, to justify ethnic classifications that seem patently\nunconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n        See, e.g., Lucy S. Dawidowicz, THE WAR AGAINST THE JEWS: 1933-45 91 (Bantam 1975);\nNora Levin, THE HOLOCAUST 69-70 (Schocken 1973).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 74\n\n\n        It may be instructive to compare the actual implementation of and articulated rationale behind\nthe Michigan plan with another, possibly well-intentioned, attempt to manipulate admissions criteria\nto achieve a diverse student body. I refer to the “religious-conscious” policies, adopted by a number\nof Ivy League universities of which Harvard was the most notable, to give preference in admissions\nto Gentiles as opposed to Jews. The policies were also designed to produce a mixture of students\nin the school that was closer to the proportion that prevailed in society, and a proportion that was\nthought to be socially and educationally beneficial.\n\n        The reasons for the policy offered by then-President Lowell of Harvard are hauntingly similar\nto the rationale given here. As Lowell explained, without the policies “Harvard would lose its\ncharacter as a democratic national university drawing from all classes of the community and\npromoting a sympathetic understanding among them.” Letter from President Lowell, reprinted in\nHenry Aaron Yeomans, ABBOTT LAWRENCE LOWELL , 1856-1943 209 (Arno 1977). Lowell worried\nthat “race feeling would become intense” if numbers of students were not more proportional to the\ngeneral population, and that if the numerical imbalance could be rectified, “it would eliminate race\nfeeling among the students, and ‘as these students passed out into the world, eliminating it in the\ncommunity.’” Nitza Rosovsky, THE JEWISH EXPERIENCE AT HARVARD AND RADCLIFFE 15 & n.2\n(Harvard 1986) (quoting A. Lawrence Lowell Papers # 1056). Lowell also believed that his policy\nwould be “in the interests of Jews, as well as of everyone else.” Ibid.\n\n        The weighted preference system at Harvard then worked much the same as Michigan’s. The\n“Harvard plan” of its day also considered each applicant individually. Some Jews were admitted,\nsome were not. Their religion was only one factor among many that were considered. It was\nperfectly clear, in the words of Justice Powell, that “the applicant who loses out on the last available\nseat to another candidate receiving a ‘plus’ on the basis of ethnic background will not have been\nforeclosed from all consideration for that seat.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 318. Those who were not\nadmitted could not be certain that their ethnicity had been decisive. All applicants admitted were\ncertainly “qualified,” by the same standards as the Michigan plan.\n\n        Perhaps the crucial distinction comes from the notion that a true “plus” program would lack\na “facial intent to discriminate.” Ibid. This could only be the case if the plus was in some fashion\nmodest, and calibrated truly in connection with other comparable characteristics. The fact that the\n“Harvard plan” of the 1930's basically cut Jewish numbers by half or more would belie the lack of\na “facial intent to discriminate.” See generally Marcia Graham Synnott, THE HALF -OPENED DOOR\n96, 108, 110, 115 (Greenwood 1979). The University of Michigan’s plan, which by its own\ncalculations inflates the numbers of students from favored groups approximately three-to-four fold,\nsimilarly betrays a “facial intent to discriminate.” See JA at 6047.\n\n        It is thus important to note that the Michigan policy, though unintentionally, has an effect\nsimilar to that of the Harvard plan of old. The effect is similar, in my view, because a significant\nproportion of those persons who are excluded because of racial discrimination in favor of under-\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 75\n\n\nrepresented minorities are Jews. While no specific numbers have been given, a wide variety of\nsources indicate that Jewish representation in general in law schools is several multiples of the\nproportion of Jews in the general population. There is no reason to believe that as a proportion of\nthose excluded by Michigan’s policies, the impact would be any different.\n\n         If policies like the Law School’s are permitted, the adverse effect on “over-represented”\nminorities will only grow more grave because such policies inexorably drive toward a philosophy\nin which admissions are parceled out roughly in proportion to representation in the general\npopulation. The Law School may deny this, and argue that the policy is only for “under-represented”\nminorities. But, if suitably divided, any group can become a minority. If one distinguishes between\ndenominations of Christianity, no religion is a majority in America. Using only the constitutionally\nprotected classes of national origin, no ethnic background is a majority. Thus, by the rationale of\nMichigan’s policy, every group suitably defined could be entitled to “a critical mass” of its members\nso that those students, too, should “not feel isolated or like spokespersons” nor “feel uncomfortable\ndiscussing issues freely based on their personal experiences.” Majority Op. at 15. And then, by the\ninexorable laws of mathematics, the existence of a critical mass or rough proportionality for each\ngroup so considered means that what is left for the remainder of the groups (those formerly “over-\nrepresented”) is no more than its own critical mass of “rough proportionality.” And there lies the rub.\nBeing relegated to rough proportionality brings Jewish applicants full circle to their chances under\nLowell’s “Harvard Plan,” or even worse, as Jews today constitute only 2-3% of the total population.\nThe Law School and the court will certainly deny this, but that is where the figures unavoidably lead\nus.\n\n        These prospects for such uninhibited racial and ethnic discrimination are especially important\nbecause the Law School has declined to justify its policy as remedying past discrimination.17 There\nis no limiting principle preventing the Law School from employing ethnic or religious preferences\nto arrange its student body by critical mass. In short, the compelling state interest of developing a\n\n\n\n\n       17\n         The Law School’s disavowal is why I do not discuss whether the remediation of past\ndiscrimination is a compelling state interest that could justify the Law School’s actions. Not only\nmust a state interest be compelling to satisfy strict scrutiny, but it must also be the interest that\nmotivated the classification in the first instance. While we have been reluctant to determine what\nactually motivated legislative bodies, see, e.g., Federal Communications Comm’n v. Beach\nCommunications, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112870\"><a href=\"/opinion/112870/fcc-v-beach-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315 (1993), the Law School administration is the sole creator\nof the admissions policy at issue here and we can rely on its assurance (as compared to the statement\nof a particular legislator or an incomplete statutory preamble) that such remediation is not the\npurpose of its admissions policy.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 76\n\n\ndiverse student body would justify an infinite amount of engineering with respect to every racial,\nethnic, and religious class.18\n\nB. Is the Law School’s Admissions Policy Narrowly Tailored?\n\n        If pressed, however, it would be unnecessary to determine whether promoting diversity in\neducation constitutes a compelling state interest because we, just as Justice Powell in Bakke, are not\nfaced with an admissions scheme that is narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest\nof diversity in education. For the majority, the inquiry into narrow tailoring begins and ends with\na determination that the Law School neither “sets aside” an exact number of seats for racial or ethnic\nminorities nor admits minorities with a specific quota of admittees in mind. The distinction of\nquotas from other preferences is the dividing line between constitutional and unconstitutional\nadmissions policies, on this view. For this position, the majority points to the Harvard plan, not of\nLowell’s time, but the one of which Justice Powell, on the basis of no factual record but only a bland\ndescription appended to an amicus brief, spoke approvingly in Bakke. That plan, using race only as\na “plus,” does not offend the Constitution according to the majority because of Powell’s advisory\nopinion on its constitutionality. Therefore, the majority would hold that all plans that merely use\nrace as a “plus” are constitutional. Yet, the constitutional analysis of racial preferences appears to\nbe binary for the majority in that a preference is either a forbidden quota or a permissible plus.\n\n        We must be, however, concerned about the magnitude of this preference. Even assuming,\nagainst all doubt, that Justice Powell’s opinion on the constitutionality of a plan not any part of the\n\n\n       18\n          Because of our society’s history of religious discrimination and religion’s continuing\nsalience, I have at times recognized the analogy between religious preference and the racial and\nethnic preference bestowed in this case. For example, at oral argument I questioned counsel about\nthe constitutionality of engineering a critical mass of Southern Baptists at the Law School. Counsel\nfor the Law School attempted to deflect this analogy by arguing that a religious preference of the\nsame form as the Law School’s racial and ethnic preference would raise “special” constitutional\nproblems of “getting entangled” with religion in violation of the “First Amendment.” Tr. at 16-17.\nIn essence, counsel’s argument was that an admissions policy with religious preferences that would\ncomport with the Equal Protection Clause could nevertheless violate the Establishment Clause. I\ncould find no case or even analytic argument for the proposition that a policy, pursuing a compelling\nstate interest and tailored narrowly to that interest, could violate the Establishment Clause. Cf. Droz\nv. CIR, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"690339\"><a href=\"/opinion/690339/martin-h-droz-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1122 (9th Cir. 1995) (noting the relevance of the strict scrutiny framework to\nthe First Amendment inquiry). With as much justification as the Law School disclaims any invidious\nanimus toward “over-represented” groups in its policy, comparable discrimination against “over-\nrepresented” religious groups could be said not to represent the establishment of all other religions\nor the irreligious. I am convinced that the analogy, and therefore the inevitable implications, of the\nLaw School’s constitutional argument here, hold.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 77\n\n\ncase or controversy before the Court could be a holding binding on this court, I cannot believe that\na “plus” of any size, no matter how large, would be therefore constitutional. I believe that the Law\nSchool’s preference is just too large to be narrowly tailored.\n\n        My analysis of the narrow tailoring defects of the Law School admissions scheme falls into\nfour parts. First, I detail the true magnitude of the Law School’s preference. Second, I explain why\nwe cannot draw a meaningful distinction between the Law School’s attempts to achieve a “critical\nmass” of under-represented minorities and the quotas that the majority concedes to be\nunconstitutional. Third, I question whether a strong racial preference bears any demonstrable\nrelationship to the claimed benefits of educational pluralism. Fourth and finally, I suggest some\nrace-neutral means of achieving the Law School’s avowed ends that the Law School has not pursued.\n\n       1. The True Magnitude of the Law School’s Racial Preference\n\n        Because the majority has not laid out the magnitude of the discrimination revealed by the\nrecord, it is important to detail it here. An examination of the admissions data shows that even the\nmost qualified majority19 students (those with an LSAT over 170 and a GPA over 3.75) do not\nachieve the perfect admissions percentages for under-represented minority students with a GPA\nnearly a point less and an LSAT score in the 164-66 range. More roughly speaking, under-\nrepresented minorities with a high C to low B undergraduate average are admitted at the same rate\nas majority applicants with an A average with roughly the same LSAT scores.20 Along a different\naxis, minority applicants with an A average and an LSAT score down to 156 (the 70th percentile\nnationally) are admitted at roughly the same rate as majority applicants with an A average and an\nLSAT score over a 167 (the 96th percentile nationally).\n\n       The figures indicate that race is worth over one full grade point of college average or at least\nan 11-point and 20-percentile boost on the LSAT. In effect, the Law School admits students by\ngiving very substantial additional weight to virtually every candidate designated as an “under-\nrepresented minority” or, equivalently, by substantially discounting the credentials earned by every\nstudent who happens to fall outside the Law School’s minority designation.\n\n        For the potential applicant, the Law School’s system creates very different dilemmas\ndepending on his race. If confronted a year before they applied to the Law School with the records\nof two students, whose non-racial credentials were equivalent, we might evaluate their prospects for\nadmission as follows: Student A could work harder and raise her GPA by a full point. Student B\n\n\n\n\n       19\n            Meaning, for these purposes, those students who are not “under-represented minorities.”\n       20\n            JA at 603, 605. Comparison between students in the 167-169 LSAT range in 1997.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 78\n\n\ncould reveal the fact of his skin color or ethnicity, it being in one of the preferred categories.21 The\nLaw School’s admissions officer, who before both changes would have rated the students equally,\nwould now find the students equal, the effort of the one being counterbalanced by the background\nof the other.\n\n        More shocking is the comparison of the chances of admission for applicants with the same\nacademic credentials (at least numerically). Taking a middle-range applicant with an LSAT score\n164-66 and a GPA of 3.25-3.49, the chances of admission for a white or Asian applicant are around\n22 percent. For an under-represented minority applicant, the chances of admission (100%) would\nbe better called a guarantee of admission.\n\n        At some point, however, comparison of the admissions rates of white, Asian, and other\nunselected ethnic applicants and the minority groups designated for preference becomes impossible.\nThe Law School simply stops meaningful consideration of non-minority candidates below certain\ngrade point and LSAT figures,22 a practice demonstrated by admissions rates well below 10 percent,\nand often the absence of a single admitted student, in these credential categories. “Under-\nrepresented minorities,” on the other hand, not only continue to have respectable chances of\nadmission in these categories, but in most cases enjoy rates of admission in excess of 80 percent.23\nFar from receiving “competitive consideration,” majority applicants are all but summarily rejected\nwith credentials, but not ethnicity, identical to their under-represented minority “competitors” who\nare virtually guaranteed admission. The Law School’s admissions practices betray its claim that it\ngives meaningful individual consideration to every applicant notwithstanding their race.\n\n\n\n       21\n           While it should not be necessary to make this point, the use of hypotheticals or examples\nthat illustrate the effective impact of the policies under consideration is in no way a commentary on\nspecific persons. If a policy has real effects that seem impolite or offensive, that is a result of the\npolicy, not of those who point it out.\n       22\n          Majority applicants with an A average and LSAT over 164 enjoy admission rates over 40%.\nAs their grades slide to a high B average and an LSAT over 164, their admission rates drop to around\n20%. Below a 164, majority applicants are not admitted at a rate any more than 10%, regardless of\ntheir grade point average.\n       23\n         By comparison, designated minorities are not only considered, but admitted in rates over\n60%, and usually over 80%, with LSAT scores down to 154 and grade point averages in the low B\nrange. Even below these figures, designated minorities are still admitted at rates nearing 30% in\nmany categories of LSAT and GPA. Not until the designated minorities’ LSAT drops below 150\n(47th percentile nationally) or a GPA of 2.5 do we see admission rates under 10% for designated\nminorities.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 79\n\n\n          The sharp threshold for admission that the Law School appears to establish for majority\napplicants reveals the emptiness of another purported justification for its racial preference. The Law\nSchool justifies its stark preference, in part, by claiming that all the applicants admitted, even those\nadmitted because of its preference, are “qualified.” If the Law School actually believed that all\napplicants, with combinations of credentials sufficient for admission for minorities, were truly\n“qualified,” it would likely be willing at least to consider admitting majority applicants who were\nequally “qualified.” Instead, the Law School reveals its true views regarding the necessary\ncredentials for its law students through its clear line in its admission of majority candidates: students\nbelow the credential threshold either diminish the educational environment of the school or spare\nit only if kept to a small percentage of the class.\n\n       In the alternative, the Law School’s process designates as “qualified” virtually all who apply\nfor admission. If the Law School is being honest, it considers every last under-represented minority\nadmitted “qualified.” Indeed, the admissions data reveal that the Law School admits nearly every\nminority student who meets threshold credentials, as there appears to be a sharp cliff in rates of\nadmission between extremely small variations in objective credentials.24 If the Law School considers\neveryone above this minority threshold “qualified,” it must also consider the 89 percent of the\napplicant pool above this threshold “qualified.” Yet it is clear that the Law School would not be\ncomfortable with the random admission of any of the 89% of its applicant pool. The Law School\ndoes not truly consider majority applicants toward the bottom half of this 89% “qualified” – it admits\nalmost none of them.\n\n        The Law School’s use of the term “qualified” reveals its slipperiness. The court majority\nreveals the Law School’s shift in usage when it explains the rejection of a more random selection\nmethod because the school seeks to assemble “both a highly qualified and richly diverse academic\nclass.” Majority Op. at 19. The Law School appears to be all too cognizant of the difference\nbetween “highly qualified” and merely “qualified” applicants. Its two steep cliffs in the admissions\nrate, one for under-represented minority applicants and one for majority applicants, demonstrate that\nthe Law School maintains a “two-track,” indeed separated, system for admissions. Using its under-\nrepresented minority threshold, the Law School fills its seats reserved for “qualified” candidates.\nUsing its majority threshold, the Law School completes the balance of its class with “highly\nqualified” applicants. That the Law School merely seeks to insure that “all its students are qualified”\nis an empty claim.\n\n\n\n\n        24\n         For example, there is a sharp drop in rates of admission between under-represented minority\napplicants with a 154 to a 155 LSAT score and those with a 151 to a 153. With a 154 to a 155, we\nsee admission rates in excess of 60%. With a 151 to a 153, however, minorities are admitted at rates\nbelow 20%.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 80\n\n\n        The Law School argues, however, that these overwhelming data are illusions produced\nthrough the smoke of litigation. These data, standing alone, the Law School seems to claim, could\nbe produced by very small differences in actual qualifications. Taking certain hypothetical statistics,\nthe Law School’s contention could certainly hold. For example, if for some reason every applicant\nhad the same LSAT score, but every white had a GPA of 3.50 and every black had a GPA of 3.49,\na “racial preference” would be required to obtain any admission of black students, but the degree of\nthat preference would obviously be very small. The difference in chances of admission for the black\nand white applicants would still be very large, but the practical amount of preference would be very\nsmall.\n\n        However, such are not the admissions statistics in this case. As the statistics show, the\ndegree of preference can be characterized, in the benign words of Justice Powell and Harvard, as a\n“tip” only with some considerable violence to terminological exactitude.25 The term “tip” would\nconvey to the average reasonable person something that overbalances a fairly closely divided or\nnearly evenly balanced choice. A seesaw with roughly equivalent children on either end can be\n“tipped” from one side to the other with a small weight. However, if a boulder must be placed on\none side to shift the balance, the term “tip” would apply only if it were infinitely elastic. A common-\nsense view of a “tip” might be that in a zone where 80 or 90% of majority applicants are admitted,\n100% of minorities would be favored. Or, in a zone where only 10 or 20% of majority applicants\nare admitted, 30 or 40% of minorities might be. If Justice Powell’s words are to be used as anything\nmore than a subterfuge, that would be the kind of preference that a fair reading of his opinion might\nendorse.\n\n        The majority responds that there is no evidence in Bakke about how large the racial\npreference was in the Harvard plan of which Justice Powell spoke approvingly. Majority Op. at 25-\n26. As a result, it is impossible to know whether the Law School’s alleged “plus” was larger than\nHarvard’s. Majority Op. at 17. Immediately thereafter, the majority concludes that the Law School’s\nadmission scheme is “virtually identical to the Harvard plan,” and that therefore the Law School’s\nsystem must be constitutional. Ibid. How does the majority know that the Law School’s system is\n“virtually identical” to Harvard’s? I am deeply puzzled regarding how the majority could place both\nits confession of ignorance regarding the details of the Harvard plan and its claim that the two plans\nare identical in the same paragraph. The majority’s argument, yet again, simply elides empirical\npremises necessary to sustain what it claims to be the controlling analogy between the Law School\nand Harvard plans.\n\n        And indeed the majority’s recognition that there is no factual record regarding the Harvard\nplan in Bakke echoes the reason why federal courts do not issue advisory opinions on cases not\nbefore them and why we find binding only the holdings, but not the dicta, of prior cases. Without\n\n\n       25\n            Cf. United States v.

Bollinger\nPage 81\n\n\nan actual case or controversy before it, a court is not able to develop a factual record and to\ndetermine which facts would be legally relevant. The absence of a factual record on the Harvard\nplan reinforces the reasons that Justice Powell’s thoughts regarding its potential constitutionality are\nnot binding.\n\n         Even if we know nothing of the absolute magnitude of the Harvard plan other than its\ndescription as merely a “tip” or a “plus,” we have some evidence regarding its relative magnitude.\nAs described in the amicus brief before the Court in Bakke, the Harvard plan provided that “the race\nof an applicant may tip the balance in his favor just as geographic origin or life spent on a farm may\ntip the balance in other candidates’ cases.” LANDMA RK BRIEFS AND ARGUMENTS, supra n.1, at 736\n(emphasis added). From the description, it would seem that Harvard’s racial preference would be\nsimilar in magnitude to the preference given other soft factors. We know, however, from the\nindisputable statistical evidence in this case and the Law School’s own admission that no other soft\nfactor is even remotely as significant as race in its admission decisions. Additionally, there is\nnothing in the Harvard description that even hints that its preferences for race or others factors of\ndiversity are of the magnitude here, taking the chance of admission from near zero to near 100%, in\nmany cases.\n\n        It is clear from the Law School’s statistics that under-represented minority students are nearly\nautomatically admitted in zones where white or Asian students with the same credentials are nearly\nautomatically rejected. Indeed, the Law School concedes that its racial preference is sufficiently\nheavy that 3 out of 4 under-represented minority students would not be admitted if all students were\ntruly considered without regard to race. JA at 6047. The characterization of the Law School’s\npreference as only a “tip” or “plus” would eviscerate those words, and transform Powell’s thoughful\ndiscussion into a carte blanche for adopting the UC Davis system with only a few cosmetic changes.\n\n        One might wonder why I focus so heavily on the LSAT and GPA admissions data provided\nby the Law School. Of course, the constitutional deficiencies of the Michigan policy have nothing\nto do with the question of how and whether universities should consider academic measures such\nas GPA and LSAT in their admissions policies. Michigan is perfectly free to abandon or to\nrestructure those measures. However, those are the standards it has chosen to distinguish among\nmajority candidates, and to distinguish among minority candidates. Equal protection of the laws\ndemands that the objective standards that the Law School chooses are applied with some modicum\nof equality, and they are not here.26\n\n\n       26\n         The concurring opinion criticizes this statistical analysis by noting scholarship suggesting\nno good link between “numerical credentials,” presumably meaning LSAT and GPA, and “success\nin Law School.” Concurring Op. at 39-40 (Clay). My only point here is that, notwithstanding the\ndebate over more accurate measures of educational merit, the Law School undoubtedly thinks LSAT\nand GPA are most important. The only other credential that appears to be systematically important\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 82\n\n\n        Michigan argues, with some justification, that it also considers a wide variety of “soft”\nfactors. And nothing in this opinion denigrates the use of such factors, or even changing or\nincreasing them, so long as they are applied equally. However, it is of the greatest importance to\nnote that Michigan does not contend, in any way, that the consideration of those factors explains any\nadvantage, systematic or otherwise, for minority candidates. It does not make that claim in its filings\nor briefs, and I specifically put the question in oral argument: “Do you assert that under-represented\nminorities systematically have stronger [soft factors] than non-minority students?” Counsel\nresponded with a firm “no.” Tr. at 41. Thus, the issue is not the merits behind one combination of\nqualifications or another. The constitutional dilemma presented is the use, or at least the degree of\nuse, of race to overcome qualifications, however defined.\n\n       2. Differentiating a “Critical Mass,” a “Plus” and a “Quota”\n\n       As I have just explained, the preference accorded minorities in the Law School’s admissions\nscheme is different in magnitude from the “plus” or the “tip” that Justice Powell thought might be\npermissible under certain conditions. The Law School’s racial preference, however, suffers from\ndeeper problems – as it appears calibrated to admit a certain percentage of under-represented\nminority students. The Law School concedes that the preference is designed to admit a “critical\nmass” of under-represented minority students. Of course, the term “critical mass” is intentionally\nvague. When pressed, the Law School will explain that a “critical mass” is that number of students\nnecessary to enable “minority students [to] contribute to classroom dialogue and not feel isolated.”\nMajority Op. at 5. Pressed further, the Law School will not say that any particular number of\nminority students constitutes a critical mass. It seems obvious to me, however, that the Law School\nhas an opinion as to what that number is and attempts to achieve it.27\n\n       The majority summarily dispenses with this problem, approvingly quoting the comforting\nreassurances of Dean Lehman (“We do not have a portion of the class that is set aside for a critical\nmass”) without noting that in fact a critical mass is always obtained. Majority Op. at 14. And\ncomforting those words must be, as a contrary response would have produced what appears to be the\nonly manner in which a racial preference in admissions could be unconstitutional for the majority:\na quota system. Yet Harvard in the 1930's did not have to say that exactly 87 percent of the seats\n\n\n\n\nis race, and I think we should at least be candid about how much emphasis that the Law School\nplaces on race. To the extent that the concurrence mounts a more substantial attack on the use of\nnumerical credentials generally, its quarrel is with the Law School, not with my position.\n       27\n        See, e.g., Tr. at 21-24, where counsel for the Law School admitted that 3-5% would not be\nenough and that “clearly we care about the number.”\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 83\n\n\nwere set aside for Gentiles – it just had to apply an admissions system based on “character” that\nachieved roughly the same result.28\n\n        The results of the Law School’s system to produce a “critical mass” reassure us that the Law\nSchool really seeks to enroll a critical number of minority students. Between 1995 and 1998, the last\nfour years for which we have data, the Law School consistently enrolled a number of under-\nrepresented minorities constituting 13.5 to 13.7 percent of the class enrolled. The absolute numbers\nare just as consistent: 47 of 341 in 1998, 46 of 339 in 1997, 44 of 319 in 1996, and 46 of 340 in\n1995. University of Michigan Law School’s Report to the ABA, JA at 643. The statistics\ndemonstrate that the Law School was more successful at enrolling a precise number of under-\nrepresented minorities than a precise number of total students.29 It seems clear to me, at least, that\nthe “critical mass” the Law School seeks to achieve is only vague and flexible for outsiders not\nlooking at its enrollment statistics.30 The Law School’s “critical mass” of designated minorities is\n44-47 per class, or around 13.5%.\n\n        The majority and the Law School stress that minority enrollment numbers have varied,\nindicating that the Law School does not maintain a fixed target for minority admissions. The fact\n\n\n       28\n          The percentage of Harvard students who were Jewish varied between 1933-42, but was\nquite stable and well below the percentages in the 1920's. In the 1920's, the percentage consistently\napproached 30%. A glance at the 1933-42 Harvard figures, with percentages of 12.4, 9.9, 10.9, 14.8,\n14.0, 15.4, 14.4, 16.0, 14.1, and 16.1, reveals a chart that looks very much like Michigan’s with\nrespect to under-represented minorities. Synnott, THE HALF -OPENED DOOR at 115, Table 4.8 (1971).\n       29\n         Admittedly, these percentages did deviate a bit from this tight grouping in some years\nbefore 1995 being, respectively, 12%, 14%, 14%, 13%, 19%, 20%, 14%, 20%, for the years 1987-94.\nThese deviations, however, do not muddle the extraordinarily tight grouping in the last four years\nand primarily show what may have been, in the Law School’s view, “excessive” percentages in three\nof the years. Nevertheless, the lowest percentage never falls below 12%, while the Law School\nacknowledges that three-fourths of that number is accounted for by the application of its preference\npolicy.\n        Of course, even these early numbers are consistent with the Law School’s maintaining a\nnumerical target. Perhaps the Law School had a different target in those years. It is hard to know,\nbecause the Law School has failed to specify its view of “critical mass.” Perhaps the Law School\nsimply got better at exactly achieving its target.\n       30\n         There is little solace in the Law School’s unwillingness to reveal its quota. I share Justice\nBrennan’s view: “there is no basis for preferring a particular preference program simply because in\nachieving the same goals [as a quota system], it proceeds in a manner that is not immediately\napparent to the public.” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 379.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 84\n\n\nthat there has been any variation (.2% over four years), trivial though it may be, in the percentage\nof students admitted who are minorities satisfies the majority that the Law School does not maintain\na quota. After all, the majority instructs us, variation produces a range, and a range will always have\na “minimum,” that might look like a number below which the Law School will not go. Majority Op.\nat 16. Such is the nature of a range, the majority says, almost suggesting that it was foolish to be\nconcerned about the question. Ibid.\n\n        I am not concerned just with the bottom of the range, but also its top. The range, as I have\ndemonstrated, is remarkably tight. Admittedly, it is not identical from year to year – but the lack of\nidentity does not seem enough to demonstrate that the Law School does not have an exceedingly\nprecise numerical target in mind when admitting its students. The fact that a quota is a range rather\nthan one specific number certainly does not insulate a program from constitutional scrutiny. In\nBakke, had UC Davis said “We’re going to reserve, oh, about 14 to 18 seats, maybe give or take a\nfew,” for minority students – and then, indeed hit that range every year, I doubt that anyone can\nseriously believe that the outcome of that case would have been different.\n\n         The majority’s reliance on such slight variations also ignores the imprecision involved in\nproducing enrollment. A law school does not admit students with perfect information regarding its\nyield, that is the percentage of students that will accept offers of admission. The yield is radically\ndependent on the idiosyncratic preferences of the students admitted. Accordingly, in a given year,\nhighly selective law schools may have ten percent variations in the overall sizes of their enrolled\nclasses, much less any desired component part. The University of Michigan Law School is no\nexception, enrolling 341 students in 1998, 339 in 1997, 319 in 1996, 340 in 1995, 363 in 1994.\nGiven these uncertainties, the quite narrow range of minority enrollment percentages that the Law\nSchool achieves is remarkable for its consistency, and it seems to me that the Law School is doing\nall it can to achieve a target number of minorities. I take no comfort in the statistically minor\nvariations in minority enrollment.\n\n        Indeed, the record makes it clear that, to take a hypothetical example, if the Law School were\nto discover near the end of its process that a large number of its admitted minority students had all\ndecided to attend other schools, thus leaving both a block of empty seats and a huge deficit in the\nsought-for “critical mass,” the Law School would bend every effort to fill those seats with minority\nstudents. Before all offers of admission are made, substantial numbers of applicants accept,\nclarifying the likely composition of each class. Law School officials testified that they vigorously\nmonitor the acceptance data with regard to race on a daily basis, see Depo. of Dennis Shields, JA at\n2219-20, perhaps to admit minorities that it otherwise would not have or perhaps to admit minorities\non the waiting list. This, of course, is the practical equivalent of the “segregated waiting lists”\ncondemned in other cases. See, e.g., Hopwood v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714814\"><a href=\"/opinion/714814/cheryl-j-hopwood-v-state-of-texas-v-thurgood-marshall-legal-society-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 938 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n       The combination of the Law School’s thinly veiled references to such a target, its “critical\nmass,” and relatively consistent results in achieving a particular enrollment percentage, should\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 85\n\n\nconvince us that the Law School’s admissions scheme is functionally, and even nominally,\nindistinguishable from a quota system. At the very least, however, the Law School’s admission plan\nseems far from employing the mere “plus” or “tip” that the majority characterizes its racial\npreference to be.\n\n        In order for the language of “plus” or “tip” to have real meaning, there would have to be\nsome indication that the other, allegedly similar, plus factors were also of a strength that were\nanywhere near the potency of the preference here. After all, Justice Powell himself contended that,\nto be only his “plus,” race would need to be just one among many factors. As Justice Powell wrote,\n\n       “The file of a particular black applicant may be examined for his potential\n       contribution to diversity without the factor of race being decisive when compared,\n       for example, with that of an applicant identified as an Italian-American if the latter\n       is thought to exhibit qualities more likely to promote beneficial educational\n       pluralism. Such qualities could include exceptional personal talents, unique work or\n       service experience, leadership potential, maturity, demonstrated compassion, a\n       history of overcoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the poor, or other\n       qualifications deemed important.”\n\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 317 (Powell, concurring). The majority is content to accept the Law School’s\nclaim that it considers some of these “soft” factors. Majority Op. at 15. I would ask whether any\nof them are remotely comparable in weight. While not every factor would be required to bear equal\nweight under the Powell view, it seems clear that at least some of these other factors would need to\nbe capable of taking a student’s chances from virtual certainty of rejection to virtual certainty of\nadmission. There is no such evidence as to any race-neutral factor, but there is repeated and\nconsistent evidence of such a treatment of race and ethnicity.\n\n       3. Achieving the Benefits of a Diverse Educational Environment\n\n       Even if I were not convinced that the Law School’s pursuit of a “critical mass” of minority\nstudents is a constitutionally invalid means to achieve diversity, I would still find the empirical link\nbetween such “critical mass” and the values of diversity lacking. 31 The Law School never provided\n\n\n       31\n          This discussion highlights the overlapping nature of the two-step equal protection analysis.\nOne might think that a discussion of the benefits of diversity would be better placed in the analysis\nof whether diversity in education is a compelling state interest. At this point, it is important to be\nprecise. No one, not even the Law School or Justice Powell, claims that diversity for its own sake\ncan constitute a compelling state interest. Instead, the claim is that diversity yields race-neutral\nbenefits that are themselves compelling. More precisely speaking, diversity in education is a means\nof achieving the compelling state interest in the benefits of diversity.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 86\n\n\nany evidence that the existence of the “critical mass” would in fact contribute to classroom dialogue\nor would lessen feelings of isolation or alienation. The only evidence at all bearing on this is from\nthe Gurin Report.\n\n        The Gurin report is questionable science, was created expressly for litigation, and its\nconclusions do not even support the Law School’s case. The benefits of a diverse student body that\nthe study purports to prove, essentially better learning32 and increased democratic participation,33 are\nthemselves vague to a degree that we would never accept to satisfy strict scrutiny in any other\ncontext. The concurring opinion34 contends that this opinion ignores the Gurin report in discussing\ndiversity’s capacity to deliver its claimed benefits. Concurring Op. at 29 (Clay). The concurring\nopinion, however, does not even mention, much less analyze, the strength of Gurin’s proof. The\n“study” suffers from profound empirical and methodological defects that lead me to doubt its\nprobative value. And certainly neither the trial court as finder of fact nor the majority opinion take\nthe report’s conclusions as fact.\n\n        First, the report falls well short of making the Law School’s case, even if we simply accept\nit without scrutinizing its conclusions. The report takes no position on how much diversity is\nrequired to yield the claimed benefits, and thus does not even purport to substantiate the Law\nSchool’s claim that a “critical mass” of minorities is required to achieve the educational benefits of\ndiversity.35\n\n\n       32\n          The report claims that the educational benefits that positively correlate with diversity\ninclude “graduate degree aspirations,” “drive to succeed,” and “academic ability.” Gurin also notes,\nin passing, that the favorable outcomes for African-American students, with which she reports a\ncorrelation to her diversity measures, do not include actual learning as measured by grade point\naverage. See JA at 2355; Patricia Gurin, The Compelling Need for Diversity in Higher Education,\n5 Mich. J. of Race and L. 363, 391 (1999).\n       33\n        The democratic benefits include “influencing social values,” “helping others in difficulty,”\nand “being involved in environmental activities.”\n       34\n         Although there are two concurring opinions in this case, only Judge Clay’s addresses the\nsubstantive portion of this dissent. My references in the text to the “Concurring Opinion” refer to\nJudge Clay’s. I will make a more specific reference when referring to Judge Moore’s concurring\nopinion.\n       35\n          The relationship between diversity and these assorted educational benefits could be\nproportional, exponential, or stepwise. If it were merely proportional, there would appear to be no\nbasis for the Law School’s attempts to achieve a “critical mass,” rather than each marginal “under-\nrepresented minority” bringing equal benefit.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 87\n\n\n       Second, the report’s aspirations to empiricism are undermined by the subjectivity of its data.\nAfter all, the report bases its claimed educational benefits on only the subjective self-reports of\nstudents.\n\n        Third and most importantly, the statistical regressions relied on by the report never examine\nthe statistical link between having a more diverse student body and the benefits that it claims.\nInstead, the regressions investigate only the correlation between the claimed benefits and two proxy\nvariables for diversity: “classroom diversity” and “informal interactional diversity.” See Gurin\nReport, JA at 2434, 2437, 2441, 2446. “Classroom diversity” is defined as the responding student\nhaving taken an ethnic studies class, and “informal interactional diversity” as a student having had\nsocial interaction with or about minorities in college. Ibid. Both of these variables, however, are\nindependent of having a more racially or ethnically diverse student body, and appear to make the\ncase for more ethnic studies classes or informational seminars about ethnic issues, instead of greater\nnumbers of minority students. In fact, one wonders why Gurin did not directly correlate her benefits\nto the much less complex, but infinitely more relevant, variable of participation in a more diverse\nstudent body: I fear that Gurin used the proxies because a study of mere student body diversity either\ndid not or would not produce the results that she sought.36 In any event, we lack any even\npurportedly empirical evidence demonstrating a correlation between increasing the number of under-\nrepresented minorities enrolled and the vague benefits of diversity claimed by the Law School.37\n\n\n       36\n          I am not alone in questioning the conclusions of the Gurin Report and the poverty of the\nempirical evidence presented. A social scientist and supporter of affirmative action in education\nevaluating some of the same data that Gurin used, but also examining actual student body diversity,\nconcluded that “academic outcomes are generally not affected” by student body diversity, and that\nthe effects that are indicated are “very weak and indirect.” Alexander W. Astin, WHAT MATTERS IN\nCOLLEGE ? 362 (Jossey-Bass 1993). As we might expect from the vague list of claimed benefits, this\nresearcher’s study concluded that “[t]he values, attitudes, and socioeconomic status of the peer group\nare much more important determinants of how the individual student will develop than are the peer\ngroup’s abilities, religious orientation, or racial composition.” Id. at 363. Accordingly, a candid and\nempirically rigorous affirmative action supporter has admitted that a link between racial diversity\nand improved educational results has “yet to be convincingly demonstrated” and that “[t]he research\nstill needs to be done that would demonstrate the link.” Peter Schmidt, Debating the Benefits of\nAffirmative Action, CHRON. OF HIGHER EDUC. A25 (May 18, 2001).\n       37\n         Even more fundamentally, social science data as to the efficacy, in the eyes of one or\nanother researcher, of policies of discrimination are themselves of limited utility in resolving the\nultimate constitutional issue. At the time of Brown v. Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954),\nthere were certainly researchers with academic degrees who argued that segregated education would\nprovide greater educational benefits for both races. Does anyone think that a factual belief in such\nanalyses would have, or should have, led to a different constitutional outcome in Brown? I very\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 88\n\n\n         The Gurin Report aside, the link between the Law School’s diversity and its claimed benefits\nis conceptually flawed. The relationship between a “critical mass” and the values of diversity would\ndepend on contingencies nearly impossible to predict. The Law School’s definition seems to depend\nwholly on the psychological makeup of the people involved, whether labeled as majority or minority.\nCertainly history is replete with examples of members of minority groups, from Frederick Douglass\nto Martin Luther King to Thomas Sowell, who have said their piece and stood for what they believed\nin without regard to whether others thought them to be a “representative.” Eleanor Roosevelt is\nquoted as having said that “no one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” The same is\ntrue of representativeness. Apparently, by this measure, if and as members of the under-represented\ngroup become psychologically stronger, and thus more able or willing to speak as individuals, the\nLaw School needs less and less of them.\n\n         On the other hand, if the measurement is based on the attitudes of the “non-minority”\nstudents, there again is little concreteness to the measure. This would seem to mean that if those\noutside the minority groups were all paragons of tolerance, then there would be no need for any\npreference, because all students would uphold the precepts of the Constitution and major religions\nto treat each person as an individual. Conversely, if the majority student body stubbornly persisted\n(following the Law School’s lead) in attributing the experiences and opinions of their classmates to\ntheir racial identity, the critical mass would need to expand and expand, presumably until most or\nall of the recalcitrant majority students had been driven from campus. In short, any sort of rationale-\nbased definition of “critical mass” seems hopeless.\n\n        “Critical mass” also has difficulties if it is defined in a way divorced from some notion of\nthe “proper” representation of the particular group. Since the Law School gives no principles,\nsociological or otherwise, by which the “non-representativeness” of individual group members can\nbe judged, we would have to assume that a “critical mass” would be of approximately the same size\nfor any designated group. Thus, Afghans, Orthodox Jews, Appalachian Celts, or fundamentalist\nChristians might also feel that their remarks were being taken as representative, rather than\n\n\nstrongly doubt it. Similarly, research asserting that Jews and Gentiles in fact interacted more\nharmoniously under Lowell’s Harvard plan would not justify that policy either.\n        I note that this question is not simply of academic or antiquarian interest. Questions have\nbeen raised as to the ability or desirability of school districts implementing all-black academies in\norder to improve educational performance. See Wil Haygood, Rethinking Integration: On Schools,\nMany Blacks Return to Roots, BOSTON GLOBE (Nov. 16, 1997). I sincerely doubt that the factual\noutcome of conflicts between social scientists as to varying studies of the educational effect of such\npolicies would be dispositive of the constitutional question that might be raised. See Drew S. Days,\nIII, Brown Blues: Rethinking the Integrative Ideal, in REDEFINING EQUALITY (Neal Deavins and\nDavison M. Douglas, eds., Oxford 1998) (noting, while discussing the possibility of all-black public\neducational institutions, that “[e]xpedience cannot legitimize racial segregation”).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 89\n\n\nindividually, unless they, too, had a “critical mass.” Then, the makeup of the entering class could\nbe wholly determined by those groups that the Law School chose to classify as appropriate for\nworrying about their “under-represented status.” Indeed, the Law School does not appear to believe\nthat the critical mass for Native Americans, for example, is nearly as large as it is for blacks and\nHispanics. Thus, some measure of rough proportionality inevitably creeps in as the measure of what\nis the “critical mass.” Although the Law School’s deponents tried very hard to avoid any specificity\nin their responses (“A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow”), it was clear both in\nthe trial record and at oral argument that a number that was only half or less of a group’s\nrepresentation in some national measure of population would not be considered a “critical mass.”\n\n        Also problematic is how the Law School has selected the minorities entitled to a preference\nin terms of fostering a diverse educational environment. The Law School’s statement that its actions\nare justified because members of under-represented minorities are “particularly likely to have\nexperiences and perspectives of special importance” raises the question of whether it can determine\nthat other groups, such as Americans of Japanese or Welsh ancestry, are “particularly unlikely” to\nhave such experiences and perspectives. In practical effect, that is what the Law School has decided,\nand without any specific basis. Either the experiences and perspectives are themselves valuable, in\nwhich case they could be judged on that basis without reference to skin color or parentage, or the\nLaw School is assuming a heterogeneity among widely diversified groups.\n\n        4. Potential Race-Neutral Means\n\n        In order for its racial classifications to survive strict scrutiny, the state must first look to race-\nneutral means to achieve even compelling state interests. The Supreme Court has made clear that\ncourts must determine whether a state’s racial classification is necessary with reference to the\nefficacy of race-neutral alternatives. See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 507; United States v. Paradise,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111827\"><a href=\"/opinion/111827/united-states-v-paradise/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171 (1987); Associated Gen. Contractors of Ohio, Inc. v. Drabik, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768958\"><a href=\"/opinion/768958/associated-general-contractors-of-ohio-inc-associated-general-contractors/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 736\n(6th Cir. 2000).\n\n        What is not crystal clear, however, is the nature of the consideration that reviewing courts\nmust undertake. Yet only one tack makes analytical sense. In order to prevail under strict scrutiny,\nthe state must demonstrate not only that its racial classification achieves compelling state benefits,\nbut also that these benefits may only be obtained by the shift from a well-designed, race-neutral\nalternative. Put differently, the state must demonstrate that the marginal benefits gained from\nemploying the racial classification over the next most efficacious race-neutral alternative are\nthemselves compelling. Any other standard would make success under strict scrutiny a mere exercise\nin question framing. The interest vindicated by a racial classification would look very large, perhaps\neven compelling, when compared to the benefits delivered by some dismal alternative. Instead, we\nshould require that before we find marginal benefits reflective of a compelling state interest, they\nmust be those gained over the best race-neutral alternatives.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 90\n\n\n        Consider some of the race-neutral alternatives available in this case. The gradient of benefits,\nalong which the race-conscious and race-neutral means are judged, is “academic diversity,” or\nachieving a pluralism of experiences and ideas. See Part III.A.1. Earlier in this opinion, I discussed\nthe possibility of considering experiential diversity in a race-neutral manner. Swamped with the\nchildren of wealthy suburbanites, the Law School could seek out applicants who were raised amidst\nrelative poverty, who attended under-funded or failing schools, who walked to school past\nwarehouses instead of coffeehouses, who experienced but conquered extreme emotional trauma, like\nthe loss of a parent, who prevailed over a profound childhood illness, who have dedicated years to\nhelping the poor in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, or, even less stirringly, who have a strong accounting\nbackground among a raft of history majors. If it really is a diversity of experiences and viewpoints\nthat the Law School seeks, why cannot the Law School just seek those experiences and viewpoints?\n\n          Instead, the Law School searches for particular races and ethnicities as a means of securing\na diversity of experience, and, so they say, for no other purpose. A well-functioning search for\nexperiential diversity would certainly yield the greatest measure of it. After all, even the Law School\nwould admit that race is an imperfect proxy for experiential diversity. Next-door neighbors in\nGrosse Pointe, separated only by 30 yards and the color of their skin, would not necessarily be\nsignificantly different from each other. In principle at least, the race-neutral means of seeking the\nexperiences themselves would seem superior to the Law School’s race-conscious means, if its aim\nis as it professes. This is quite the opposite of the woeful inadequacy of race-neutral means that we\ngenerally require to consider a racial classification narrowly tailored.\n\n        In practice, the Law School could make all sorts of arguments about the inadequacy of merely\nseeking experience. For example, admissions officers would have to read (and seriously consider)\nmore text in an application if it were seeking experience rather than race. The medium for\ncommunicating this quality, of course, lacks the efficient simplicity of the racial check-box. Yet,\nover and over again, the Law School has reassured us that its exquisitely meticulous admissions\nofficers already consider each application individually and thoroughly. Such is the luxury, the Law\nSchool tells us, of so few applications and spots to fill. I am willing to take the Law School at its\nword, and believe that it is fully capable of undertaking this searching review of individual\nexperience.\n\n         Also, a system seeking experiential diversity might increase the risk of applicant fraud. It\nmight be somewhat easier to verify that some individuals were truly of the right group than the\ndetails of their life stories. This comparative ease should not be overstated, however, as the\ndistinctions between the Law School’s “under-represented minorities,” from various types of\nHispanics to the marginally African-American, and the rest of society can be very subtle indeed. See\nPart III.B.2. Moreover, there are all sorts of readily identifiable indicia of experiential diversity.\nOne’s home mailing address gives quite a bit away. Law schools already ask for detailed financial\ninformation to make financial aid judgments, permitting a review of the relative poverty to which\nthe applicant was subjected. If the Law School were interested in the student’s secondary education,\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 91\n\n\nand the experiences that it imparted, it would not be outrageous to ask for a high school transcript.\nIndeed, as a good portion of the Law School’s student body hails from Michigan, see JA at 1947,\nthe Law School’s seasoned admissions officers could probably develop a pretty intimate\nunderstanding of the state’s high schools.\n\n         In short, the ready availability of seeking unique experiences themselves, rather than an\nimperfect proxy for them, demonstrates that the marginal benefits of the Law School using its\nsuspect racial preference instead of the available race-neutral means are far from compelling. In fact,\nbecause it seems to me that selecting on the basis of race is actually a more poorly calibrated means\nof achieving the experiential diversity that it allegedly seeks, I doubt that the Law School is really\ninterested in “academic diversity.” And this “academic diversity” is the only diversity that will\nsatisfy the Powell opinion that the majority considers outcome-determinative. Instead, it is more\nlikely that the Law School’s preference for certain races is an interest in race itself.\n\n        Another race-neutral alternative mentioned is conducting a lottery for all students above\ncertain threshold figures for their GPA and LSAT. This would insure a student body as diverse as\nthe “qualified” applicant pool itself. As demonstrated above, the Law School’s unwillingness to\nconduct a lottery among all those students that it considers “qualified” reveals that it really maintains\na two-track admissions system, one for the “highly-qualified” students of all races that it generally\nseeks, and another for under-represented minorities who are only “qualified.”38\n\n        The availability of such race-neutral means, especially in dealing with the manageably small\napplicant pool of the Law School, reveals that the Law School’s talk of desiring only “academic\ndiversity” is only window dressing for sheer racial discrimination.\n\n                                                  III\n\n         Many commentators have observed that America is still a society in which “race [as well as\nethnicity, religion and other ancestral characteristics] matters.” But we can not simply suspend the\nEqual Protection Clause until race no longer matters. Nor has the Supreme Court authorized us to\ndo so. One need not advocate literal “color-blindness,” where we neither notice nor appreciate the\ndiffering experiences and communities of others, to hold that our Constitution forbids the\ngovernment from assigning massive advantages and disadvantages based on a naked assignment of\nracial labels.\n\n\n        38\n          The concurring opinion suggests that evidence of racial and gender bias in LSAT and GPA\nfigures would render the lottery race-conscious. Concurring Op. at 42 (Clay). Of course, the lottery\nitself would be completely race-neutral. I do not see how using the Law School’s “qualification”\nthreshold, with which no party or judge has heretofore quarreled, to restrict the lottery would make\nthe lottery race-conscious.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 92\n\n\n        A significant amount of the analysis at pages 34-35 of the concurring opinion is directed to\nthe point that race continues to be a factor that operates in American society in many negative, as\nwell as positive, ways. I do not deny that. I am fully willing to stipulate that race does matter in\nAmerican society and that, on average, it matters more negatively for some, if not all, of the groups\nfavored by the Law School than it does for some, if not all, of the groups disfavored by the Law\nSchool. And I will also stipulate that such impact or disadvantage is not strictly limited by present\nincome or status. But a defense of the Law School’s policies on the basis of remediating generalized\npast discrimination has several problems.\n\n        First, the Supreme Court has firmly rejected the remediation of general “societal ills” and\npast discrimination as a justification for racial classifications. Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498 (1989). Second, it is not the basis on which the Law School has stated that it operates,\nnor was the question litigated (except by intervenors), either at the trial level or the appellate level,\nor addressed in the majority opinion. More fundamentally, however, such an approach confuses\nsocietal ills, that may be addressed by societal means, with the rights of individuals. Julian Bond,\ncertainly a person who has been knowledgeable and engaged in this issue for decades, wrote in the\nGonzaga Law Review that policies like those in question here are the “just spoils of a righteous war.”\nJulian Bond, Lecture: A Call in Defense of Affirmative Action: Just Spoils of a Righteous War, 34\nGonz. L. Rev. 1, 9 (1998). The struggle for civil rights in America, going back well over a century,\ncan certainly be characterized as a righteous war. However, the earlier set of just spoils from a\nrighteous, actual war, the American Civil War, had two characteristics. First, they were enshrined\nby changing the charter of our society, through the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution. Second, the “spoils” embodied in those amendments were taken\nfrom slaveholders themselves, or from social and political structures in which the entire society (or\nthe entire majority society) paid the bill.\n\n        In this case, the “spoils” that are involved are the individual rights to equal treatment of real\npeople like Barbara Grutter. If, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, society chooses that “every drop\nof blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by another,”39 then that bill should be paid by the whole\nsociety, and by considered alteration of our Equal Protection Clause, not by ignoring it. Though the\nwar may be righteous, such spoils taken from the Barbara Grutters of our society are not just.40\n\n\n        39\n             Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865.\n        40\n         The concurring opinion responds that, in a world without affirmative action, applicants like\nGrutter will not be much better off. Concurring Op. at 36-38 (Clay). To make its point, the\nconcurring opinion quotes at length the opinion, interlaced with some statistics, set forth in a recent\nWashington Post column. See Goodwin Liu, The Myth and Math of Affirmative Action, WASH . POST\nB1 (April 14, 2002). The concurring opinion asserts, on the basis of this evidence, that Athe idea that\nan admissions policy does so at the expense of white applicants is simply a myth.@ Concurring Op.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 93\n\n\n        It can hardly be doubted that, on average, those students who are admitted to Michigan Law\nSchool despite the policies in question will have been more favorably situated, economically and\nsocially, than those such as the plaintiff whose chances of admission have been reduced or\neliminated by those policies.\n\n        Similarly, because academic credentials are significantly correlated with parental income,\nsocial status, and education,41 the malign effects of discriminatory policies like the Law School’s will\n\n\nat 36.\n         The Liu analysis simply does not support the concurring opinion=s conclusion. First, the\narticle explicitly states that its argument applies just as forcefully to Alan Bakke. But the Supreme\nCourt certainly did not deny Bakke’s claim because he could not prove with mathematical certainty\nthat he would have received one of the sixteen places improperly segregated from the general\napplicant pool.\n         Second, the article gives the game away when it candidly states that its statistical conclusion\n“occurs in any selection process in which the applicants who do not benefit from affirmative action\ngreatly outnumber those who do.” Liu, supra, at B1; Concurring Op. at 15 (emphasis added).\n         It is true that there is a very real sense in which the wrong committed against a person\nabsolutely barred from consideration for a governmental benefit is greater than the wrong committed\nagainst a person only deprived of a fair chance of consideration.\n         But a wrong has still been committed. The concurring opinion and Liu may not characterize\nthat wrong as a “substantial disadvantage,” ibid., but the deprivation of equal consideration is a\nwrong to which the Constitution is opposed.\n         There may have been hundreds of Jews each year who were denied a fair chance for\nconsideration by the Harvard quota plan, even though a far smaller number of actual seats were\ninvolved and most such applicants could not have been certain of admission. They would not have\nbeen comforted by the force of Liu’s arguments.\n         To say that it is a matter of less importance that ten people are each deprived of a one-tenth\nchance of admission because of race than if one person is completely excluded from admission is\nto ignore both mathematics and our system of deciding cases and controversies. If Grutter’s rights\nhave been violated, the degree of the violation and the proper remedy are matters for the district\ncourt to determine in the first instance. To say that Grutter’s claims are to be ignored because the\nwhole system that she has challenged has a relatively small discriminatory impact or because the\nmagnitude of the violation as to her is small is to say that she has no rights that this court is bound\nto respect. I decline to take that attitude.\n         41\n        See, e.g., R. Richard Banks, Meritocratic Values and Racial Outcomes: Defending Class-\nBased College Admissions, 79 N.C.L. Rev. 1029, 1062 (2001) (noting that “[a] variety of studies\nhave demonstrated positive relationships between early academic achievement and parental income,\neducation, and occupation.”); Tomiko Brown-Nagin, \"Broad Ownership\" of the Public Schools: An\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 94\n\n\nrarely fall upon the children of the educators who craft them or the judges who rule upon them. The\nstatistical region where those policies really bite, and where people like Barbara Grutter are excluded\nfrom equal consideration based on their race, are areas likely to be more heavily populated by\npersons whose income, ethnicity, social standing, and religious preferences are not those of the\nacademic, legislative, and judicial decision-makers who support those policies. Thus Michigan’s\npolicy can not be seen simply as a good-hearted effort by one group to forego opportunities for itself\nfor the greater good.\n\n        Michigan’s plan does not seek diversity for education’s sake. It seeks racial numbers for the\nsake of the comfort that those abstract numbers may bring. It does so at the expense of the real rights\nof real people to fair consideration. It is a long road from Heman Sweatt to Barbara Grutter. But\nthey both ended up outside a door that a government’s use of racial considerations denied them a fair\nchance to enter. I therefore respectfully dissent from the court’s legitimation of this unconstitutional\npolicy.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the \"T-Formation\" Process Model for Achieving Educational Adequacy and Its\nImplications for Contemporary School Reform Efforts, 27 J.L. & Educ. 343, 385 (1998) (noting that\n“comparative indicia showing the relationship between socioeconomic background and academic\nperformance continues to reveal a persistent gap in achievement between wealthier and poorer\nstudents”).\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 95\n\n\n                                   PROCEDURAL APPENDIX\n\n        Although the following procedural matters do not directly affect the legal principles\ndiscussed in this case, it is important that they be placed in the record as an explanation of the\nmanner in which this case came before the particular decision-making body that has now decided\nit. Since a person reading these opinions in sequential order will have read a variety of complicated\nresponses attempting to defend what happened procedurally in this case, it may be well to begin with\nthe plainest possible statement of undisputed primary facts. The panel that considered this case prior\nto, and certainly following, the filing of the present appeals was not constituted in conformity with\n6th Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(2) of this court’s rules, or any other rule. A motion that counsel made on\nMay 14, 2001, for initial hearing en banc was not transmitted to most members of the court for five\nmonths, and was not treated as stated in the court’s order of June 4, 2001. These facts speak for\nthemselves, however each of us may choose to characterize them.\n\n        The appeals regarding the Law School’s admissions program that we have today decided\nwere filed as follows: case number 01-1447 on April 2, 2001, and case number 01-1516 on April\n18, 2001.\n\n       Under this court’s rules, these cases generally would have been assigned to a panel chosen\nat random. See 6th Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(1). This was not done. Instead, as a result of a series of\ndecisions in contravention of our rules and policies, we arrived at the present configuration.\n\n        In August 1999, a panel of this court, consisting of Circuit Judges Daughtrey and Moore and\nvisiting Senior District Judge Stafford, in case number 98-2009, decided an appeal concerning the\nrights of certain parties to intervene in the district court case underlying the current appeal, but did\nnot address the merits of the case. See Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765765\"><a href=\"/opinion/765765/barbara-grutter-for-herself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-98-2009-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1999).\n\n        Upon the filing of the instant appeals, a question could have arisen regarding whether these\nappeals, seeking review of cases already returned to the district court by a panel of this court, were\n“must panel” cases. See 6th Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(2). It is absolutely clear that the applicable procedures\nfor potential “must panel” cases were not followed to determine whether and how these cases should\nbe heard as a “must panel.”\n\n         If a panel has “returned a case to the district court for further proceedings” and another\nappeal has been taken from those further proceedings, the original panel “determine[s] whether the\nsecond appeal should be submitted to it for decision, or assigned to a panel at random.” Ibid. If a\ndistrict judge, as in this case, was on the original panel, the remaining two circuit judges from the\noriginal panel are required to decide whether the district judge should be recalled for the panel or\nwhether a third circuit judge “should be drawn to fill out the panel; provided that, if oral argument\nis scheduled, the draw shall be made from the judges of this Court scheduled to sit at that time.” Ibid.\nThese procedures were not followed in this case.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 96\n\n\n       While these cases were before the district court, several interlocutory motions were, in the\nusual course of our policies, referred to a weekly motions panel chosen at random. However, even\nthough no second appeal had been filed, the motions were then redirected to the earlier panel, which\nhad been augmented, at the direction of the Chief Judge, by the addition of the Chief Judge, not a\nrandomly chosen judge.42 Following the filing of the current appeals, all further actions regarding\nthose appeals, including a motion to stay the district court’s order, were handled by this preselected\npanel.\n\n        This was the situation when, on May 14, 2001, counsel petitioned the entire court, pursuant\nto Fed. R. App. P. 35(b)(1)(B), asking that the cases be heard by the en banc court in the first\ninstance. At this point, the en banc court consisted of eleven active judges: the nine judges who\nultimately heard this case plus then-active Judges Norris and Suhrheinrich. The petition was not\ncirculated to the entire court.\n\n        Instead, on June 4, 2001, an order was issued, at the direction of the Chief Judge and in the\nname of the court, stating that the motion “c[ame] before the court,” but holding the petition for\nhearing en banc in abeyance “until such time as the briefs of the parties have been filed, after which\nthe court will make a determination on whether the cases should be submitted to a three-judge panel\nfor adjudication or be referred to the en banc court.” (emphasis added). This order was also not\ncirculated to the en banc court. The Appellee’s proof brief was filed on June 18, 2001.43 The\npetition was still not circulated to the court. On July 1, Judge Norris took senior status. All briefing\nin the case was certainly completed by July 30, 2001. Even still, the petition was not circulated to\nthe court. On August 15, Judge Suhrheinrich took senior status.44 The petition was still not\n\n\n       42\n         It is not clear that preliminary motions can be redirected from a randomly selected motions\npanel to a purported “must panel” when no appeal has been filed.\n       43\n          Petitions for initial hearing en banc were filed in nine cases in the year 2000. Two of the\ncases, both filed pro se, were disposed of without circulating the en banc petition to the court. See\nDocket Sheets in Naturalite v. Ciarlo, No. 00-2106, decided under Rule 34, 22 Fed. Appx. 506\n(2001) and in Griffin v. Warren, No. 00-4552 (petition for certificate of appealability denied).\n        In each of the other seven cases, the petition for initial hearing en banc was circulated to the\ncourt no later than two days after the appellee’s proof brief was filed. All were disposed of by the\nfull court before the final briefs were filed.\n       44\n         The question of the circumstances under which Judge Norris and/or Judge Suhrheinrich\ncould have sat on a potential en banc court hearing the case could be a matter of some contention.\nUnder the circuit rule in place at the time, “any judge who had been in regular active service at the\ntime a poll was requested on the petition” for an en banc hearing would be a member of the en banc\ncourt hearing the case. 6th Cir. I.O.P. 35(a) (1998) (emphasis added). As Judge Gilman discussed\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 97\n\n\ncirculated to the court. On August 23, 2001, according to our internal docket, the petition was\n“referred” to the specially constituted panel. I have no reason to doubt that Judges Moore and\nDaughtrey had not known of the petition prior to that time. The special panel still did not circulate\nthe petition for an en banc hearing to the full court.45\n\n        Rather than circulating the still pending petition, the special panel scheduled the case for oral\nargument before itself, and again not a normally selected panel. According to the order, issued\nAugust 27, oral argument was to be held on October 23, fifty-seven days away. Forty-nine of those\nfifty-seven days passed, with no action being taken to circulate the still pending petition for hearing\n\n\nin his separate opinion in Popovich v. Cuyahoga Cty. Ct. of Common Pleas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776131\"><a href=\"/opinion/776131/joseph-m-popovich-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-cuyahoga-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 829 (6th\nCir. 2002) (en banc), there is a substantial question regarding whether our rule in effect at the time\nwas consistent with 28 U.S.C. § 46(c), governing the composition of courts of appeals en banc.\nNevertheless, that was the rule we followed until October 31, 2001. We subsequently changed our\nrule to compose the en banc court of all judges in regular active service “at the time of oral argument\nen banc.” 6th Cir. I.O.P. 35(a) (2002).\n         The old rule would have governed all the relevant en banc court composition issues that I\nhave raised here. From Popovich, we know that this court’s precedent is, at least by permitting\nJudge Merritt to sit in that case, that our old Policy 35(a) is not statutorily invalid. Thus, both Judges\nNorris and Suhrheinrich could have sat on the en banc court if the petition had been circulated\nearlier. Judge Norris would have been a part of the en banc court in this case if a vote on the petition\nhad been requested by July 1, over 45 days after the petition had been filed. Judge Suhrheinrich\nwould have been a part of the court if a vote had been requested by August 15, over 90 days after the\npetition was filed and more than 15 days after the completion of briefing. The specially constituted\npanel’s withholding the petition from the court until October 15, 2001, 150 days after it had been\nfiled and 75 days after the completion of briefing, had the effect of potentially keeping both judges\noff an en banc court.\n        45\n          Judge Moore’s reference to a December 5, 2000 policy imposed by the Chief Judge omits\nseveral important features of the policy. See Concurring Op. at 23-24. First, the policy states that\nit was prompted by petitions for initial hearing en banc from “pro se litigants, mainly prisoners,” not\nfrom counsel in important cases. It specifically states that it does not apply if the Chief Judge and\nclerk agree that “it is an unusual case.” I think we can all agree that this case was unusually\nimportant. Second, the policy authorized two and only two actions by the hearing panel to which\nthe case and the petition is referred. The panel could either “deny the petition” and schedule the case\nfor argument before the panel or “send the petition out to the en banc court.” Neither occurred here.\nThe policy never authorized the panel to schedule argument and not to decide the petition. Third,\nthe policy directed the panel to circulate the petition to the en banc court if it saw “some legitimate\nargument for hearing en banc.” It strains credulity to argue now, after the petition has been granted,\nthat the petition contained no “legitimate argument” for its granting.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 98\n\n\nen banc, even though all briefing certainly had been completed. Suddenly, with the panel hearing\njust eight days away, a decision was made finally to circulate the pending petition to the nine active\njudges of our court.46 The petition was circulated without any explanation for the delay, and without\neven any notation that a delay had occurred. In addition, the statement accompanying the circulation\nneither recommended an en banc hearing nor indicated why the issue was raised, at that time, as\nopposed to a time more proximate to the filing of the petition, though it did state that the full court\nwas being advised because “a question . . . has been raised regarding the composition of the panel.”47\nIn any event, sufficient members of the active court voted to have the case heard en banc, and an\norder was issued on October 19, 2001, canceling the panel hearing scheduled to occur in only four\ndays and instituting an en banc hearing before the now-reduced court.48\n\n        Judge Moore’s concurrence makes several remarkable points. She first notes that the irregular\nconstitution of the panel can be excused because “Chief Judge Martin has frequently substituted\nhimself in a variety of matters, of varying degrees of importance, throughout his tenure as chief\njudge, in order to avoid inconveniencing other circuit judges.” Concurring Op. at 26 (Moore). But,\nof course, the very point is that such a practice, to the extent it exists, was unknown to the other\nmembers of the court, who had every reason to believe that the panel had been regularly constituted.\n\n\n       46\n          In early October, one senior judge of our court became concerned about the procedures that\nhad been followed in this case, namely the specially constituted panel that had taken over this case.\nAfter that judge made several unsuccessful efforts to speak with the Chief Judge, on October 15 he\nfaxed to the Chief Judge a letter setting forth his concerns as to whether court rules and policies had\nbeen followed in this case. He received no response or any other communication regarding this letter\n(and has not, to this day). However, on the same day that he sent that letter, with the hearing only\neight days away, a decision was made to circulate the petition for an en banc hearing.\n       47\n          Judge Clay’s concurring opinion suggests that I “question[] the appropriateness of hearing\nthis case en banc” and then argues why hearing important cases en banc is good. Concurring Op.\nat 43, 44. I have no opinion on the substance of the decision to hear this case en banc, only the\nprocedures used to dictate its timing.\n       48\n         There is precedent for the special administration of a high-profile case. In Mozert v.\nHawkins Cty. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493641\"><a href=\"/opinion/493641/bob-alice-mozert-individually-and-as-guardians-ad-litem-for-travis/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1987), then-Chief Judge Lively took the case out\nof the normal hearing schedule because of educational time constraints and its importance. Rather\nthan personally constituting a special panel, the Chief Judge, after suggesting the procedure to all\nthe active judges on the court, had the clerk conduct a random draw of circuit judges to constitute\nthe panel. Pursuant to the drawing, the Chief Judge, as a matter of coincidence, was randomly\nselected. This process occurred in a matter of days, and never threatened to delay the case. If such\na transparent process had been followed here, the procedural issues noted in this appendix probably\nwould not have arisen.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 99\n\n\nThere was no reason to know of the unusual handling of the motions in 2000. There was no reason\nto know that there was any relation between the constitution of the “must panel” in 2001 and the\nactivities in 2000. And there was no reason to know that anything was going on that was not in strict\nconformity with 6th Cir. I.O.P. 34(b)(2). Thus, there was no reason to take any unusual action in\nresponse, whether before or after “April 5, 2001.” Concurring Op. at 27.\n\n        Judge Moore also contends that the Chief Judge regularly fills “vacancies in other cases,” that\nno one has previously objected to his practice, and that his practice has become “a matter of common\nknowledge among the judges of this court.” Concurring Op. at 26. I absolutely deny that this judge\nhas had any “knowledge” of, or that the Chief Judge has announced or admitted to, any such practice\nof inserting himself onto panels without a random draw.\n\n        The notion that other members of the court were in some way derelict in not sua sponte\ncalling for an initial hearing en banc as soon as the appeal was filed is both remarkable and misses\nthe point. Concurring Op. at 25-26, 27. There would be no particular reason for an initial hearing\nen banc unless there were some extraordinary circumstance, as the document Judge Moore has\nquoted obliquely indicates. Concurring Op. at 24-25.\n\n        I have been on the court for 16 years, and I do not recall an initial hearing en banc in my\ntenure. The concatenation of the irregular panel, the withholding, by whatever mechanism, of the\nmotion addressed to the court, and the later granting of that motion in haste, are matters for which\nthe other members of the court are certainly not responsible.\n\n         Judge Moore suggests that my objections to the composition of the three-judge panel are\n“minor” because the decisions regarding the composition did not “actually change[] the outcome of\nthe present case.” Concurring Op. at 24 n.5 (Moore). But as I have always made clear, it is difficult\nto know what body would have decided this case if the rules had been correctly implemented.\nFurther, to the extent that the Judge Moore claims that the irregularities in the hearing panel’s\ncomposition were the only reason for granting the en banc petition, those irregularities existed at the\ntime the petition was filed, and thus it is difficult also to argue that they did not affect the\ncomposition of the panel that ultimately decided this case. Most importantly, however, the rights\nof litigants and the members of this court to scrupulous compliance with the rules are not dependent\non the likely – or even certain – substantive outcomes of particular matters before the court.\n\n        Contrary to Judge Moore’s concurring opinion, I do not contend that the legal opinions of\nany member of this court do not represent that judge’s principled judgment in this case. Concurring\nOp. at 21-22 (Moore). However, under these circumstances, it is impossible to say what the result\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 100\n\n\nwould have been had this case been handled in accordance with our long-established rules. The case\nmight have been heard before a different panel, or before a different en banc court.49\n\n\n\n\n       49\n           Neither of the concurring opinions addressing this appendix disputes any of the factual\ncircumstances described.\n        Judge Clay argues that no negative conclusions regarding any member of this court can be\ndrawn from the handling of this case. Concurring Op. at 44 (Clay). I draw no such conclusions in\nthis appendix. It may be possible that each of these events occurred without conscious direction.\nEach reader can make an independent judgment from the apparently undisputed facts that I have laid\nout here. Frankly, I would have been most pleased if my statement of apparent facts had been proven\nwrong. Unfortunately, that has not occurred.\n        Judge Moore correctly states that our “only source of democratic legitimacy is the perception\nthat we engage in principled decision-making.” Concurring Op. at 22 (Moore). If actions are taken\nthat may imperil that legitimacy, a member of this court who observes them is left with two\nalternatives, both unpalatable. One is to allow the actions to pass in silence, even after explanations\nhave been requested, but have not been produced. Silence simply allows those actions to continue\nand to be repeated, with real consequences for both the court and the litigants who appear before it.\n        The other alternative is to place the actions on the record, for such remediation as may be\npossible.\n        I have not revealed the substance of any internal communications on this case between\nmembers of our court, with the exception of the letter of one senior judge who asked me to do so.\nSee n.46 supra.

Both the majority opinion and Judge\nBoggs’s dissent address the two key issues in this case: (1) whether diversity in higher education,\nincluding racial and ethnic diversity, is a compelling government interest, and (2) whether the\nUniversity of Michigan Law School’s admissions policy is narrowly tailored to further that goal.\nThere is much to be said for each viewpoint, but there are aspects of both opinions with which I do\nnot agree. The majority opinion, in particular, reaches what I believe to be an erroneous conclusion\nregarding the narrow-tailoring challenge to the Law School’s admissions policy. Judge Boggs’s\ndissent, on the other hand, includes arguments in support of his position that the Law School’s\nadmissions policy is not narrowly tailored that I find troublesome. Specifically, I am unpersuaded\nby his critique that no empirical link exists between a critical mass of minority students and the\nperceived educational benefits or his belief that race-neutral factors would be more likely to achieve\nthe desired diversity of experience than reliance on an applicant’s race. I therefore feel compelled\nto write a separate dissenting opinion.\n\n        The facts of the present case, in my opinion, eliminate the need to decide whether or not this\ncourt is bound by Justice Powell’s conclusion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), that educational diversity is a compelling government interest. Indeed, the\nprincipled disagreement between the majority opinion and Judge Boggs’s dissent as to the proper\nresolution of this issue underscores the confusion created by the various opinions in Bakke. No one\ndisputes, however, that Bakke stands for the proposition that an admissions policy designed to further\nthe interest of educational diversity is not narrowly tailored if it creates a two-track system for\nevaluating prospective students, where minorities are effectively insulated from competition with\nother applicants. Id. at 319-20 (holding that the University of California’s admissions system, which\nreserved a fixed number of places specifically for minority students, violated the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment).\n\n        The Law School’s admissions policy, in my view, creates such an impermissible system. I\ntherefore believe that this court should assume, without deciding, that educational diversity—as\ndefined by Justice Powell in Bakke—is a compelling government interest. Lyng v.

Bollinger\nPage 104\n\n\n       The primary problem with the Law School’s admissions policy is that the “critical mass” of\nminority students that it seeks to enroll is functionally indistinguishable from a quota. Whether\nviewed as a percentage or as an absolute number, the consistency in the minority student enrollment\ndemonstrates that the Law School has for all practical purposes set aside a certain number of seats\nfor minority students. See Judge Boggs’s discussion in Part II.B.2. of his dissent. The “critical\nmass” therefore appears to be a euphemism for the quota system that Bakke explicitly prohibits.\n\n        I believe that the Law School’s pursuit of a critical mass of minority students has led to the\ncreation of a two-track admissions system, not only in the sense that a minimum percentage of seats\nis set aside for under-represented minorities, but also because the Law School gives grossly\ndisproportionate weight to race and ethnicity in order to achieve this critical mass. Judge Boggs’s\ndiscussion of the vastly divergent admissions rates for minority students as compared to all other\napplicants to the Law School, a divergence that cannot be ascribed to any factor other than their race\nor ethnicity, demonstrates this reality. In my view, Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke unequivocally\nprohibits such a de facto dual admission system that applies one standard for minorities and another\nfor all other students. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317 (indicating approval of Harvard’s admissions plan,\nwhere “race or ethnic background may be deemed a ‘plus’ in a particular applicant’s file, yet it does\nnot insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats”).\n\n       Moreover, like Judge Boggs, I believe that the record establishes that race-neutral factors are\nnowhere near as significant in determining admissions as whether the applicant is an under-\nrepresented minority. The Law School’s policy of achieving a critical mass of minority students\nwithout giving comparable consideration to other aspects of diversity is irreconcilable with Justice\nPowell’s explanation of why a quota system represents an impermissible use of race in the\nadmissions process:\n\n       In a most fundamental sense the argument misconceives the nature of the state\n       interest that would justify consideration of race or ethnic background. It is not an\n       interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body\n       is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, with the remaining\n       percentage an undifferentiated aggregation of students. The diversity that furthers\n       a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and\n       characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important\n       element. Petitioner’s special admission program, focused solely on ethnic diversity,\n       would hinder rather than further attainment of genuine diversity.\n\nId. at 315 (Powell, J.) (emphasis omitted). In my view, this compels the conclusion that the Law\nSchool’s admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to serve the presumptively compelling\ngovernment interest in a diverse student body. Simply put, an applicant’s race or ethnicity, even if\nnot the only factor (other than LSAT scores and GPAs) that is taken into account, receives such\ngrossly disproportionate weight as to violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\fNos. 01-1447/1516\nGrutter v. Bollinger\nPage 105\n\n\n        The Law School, as the preceding discussion suggests, attempts to equate attaining a “critical\nmass” of minority students with the goal of achieving a diverse student body. But because the Law\nSchool’s goal of achieving a critical mass results in a two-track system that is functionally equivalent\nto a quota, its admissions policy is prohibited by Bakke. This is a quandry that admits of no easy\nsolution.\n\n        Is there any way, then, that race or ethnicity can ever be taken into account in a narrowly\ntailored manner that would survive strict scrutiny? Surely the answer is “Yes.” For example, in\ndifferentiating between two applicants with essentially equal LSAT scores and GPAs, where one is\nCaucasian and the other African-American, I have little doubt that favoring the under-represented\nAfrican-American applicant would pass constitutional muster if educational diversity is recognized\nas a compelling government interest. This would clearly fall within the scope of what I believe\nJustice Powell had in mind when discussing the appropriate use of a “plus” for diversity in Bakke.\n\n         The problem, according to the Law School, is that limiting the conscious favoritism of\nminorities to situations where the factor is a “plus among equals” would not likely produce the\ncritical mass that it earnestly believes is essential to achieve a truly diverse student body. On the\nother hand, such an admissions policy would presumably avoid the animosities stirred up by the\ncommon perception that admitted minority students are less qualified than their nonminority peers.\nSee Bakke, 438 U.S. at 298 (Powell, J.) (“[P]referential programs may only reinforce common\nstereotypes holding that certain groups are unable to achieve success without special protection based\non a factor having no relationship to individual worth.”) (citing DeFunis v. Odegaard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109012\"><a href=\"/opinion/109012/defunis-v-odegaard/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n343 (1974) (Douglass, J., dissenting)).\n\n        But these competing considerations are matters that need not, and cannot, be resolved by the\ncase before us. Based on the record presented, I am convinced that the Law School’s admissions\npolicy that results in a de facto quota in favor of minority students is far closer to the rigid set-aside\nsquarely prohibited by Bakke than it is to the “plus among equals” that I believe would be clearly\nconstitutional. How close the Law School would have to come to the latter end of the spectrum in\norder for its admissions policy to survive the strict-scrutiny test should, in my opinion, await another\nday, a day when a more narrowly tailored policy is formulated and presented for resolution. In the\nmeantime, I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
