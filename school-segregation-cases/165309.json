As\n\nrequired by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, Texas has asked this Court for a declaratory\n\njudgment that its redistricting plans have neither the purpose nor the effect of denying or\n\nabridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority\n\ngroup. The United States contends that the proposed congressional and State House districts\n\fadversely affect the voting rights of Hispanics. Various Intervenors assert the same claim as the\n\nUnited States, but some of them target the plans for the State Senate as well.\n\n                  On November 8, 2011, this Court denied summary judgment to Texas because: 1)\n\nTexas used an improper standard and/or methodology to determine which districts afford\n\nminority voters the ability to elect their candidates of choice; and 2) material facts remain in\n\ndispute regarding whether the plans in fact comply with Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nOrder [Dkt # 106]. This Opinion provides our analysis.\n\n                                                     I. FACTS\n\n                  A. Procedural Background\n\n                  On July 19, 2011, Texas filed the instant complaint for declaratory judgment that\n\nredistricting plans1 it adopted to govern elections for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\n(“Congressional Plan”), the State House of Representatives (“State House Plan”), the State\n\nSenate (“State Senate Plan”) (collectively the “Plans”), and the State Board of Education\n\ncomplied with Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973c. The United States and\n\nseveral of the Intervenors2 (collectively with the United States, the “Defendants”) filed answers\n\nchallenging the Congressional Plan, the State House Plan, and the State Senate Plan. No one\n\n\n\n1\n  Redistricting is a process by which national, state, and local voting districts are redrawn, normally after each\nnational census because of population changes over the intervening decade.\n2\n   This Court has granted seven parties status as Defendant-Intervenors. Each Intervenor contests various aspects of\none to three of the plans in their capacity as individual voters, state elected representatives, or civil rights advocacy\ngroups. The Davis Intervenors are Texas State Senators and representatives from districts in the Fort Worth area.\nThe Mexican American Legislative Caucus is a caucus group in the Texas House of Representatives. The Gonzales\nIntervenors are a group of Hispanic and Black voters residing in Texas. The Texas Legislative Black Caucus is\ncomposed of seventeen members of the Texas House of Representatives. The Texas Latino Redistricting Task Force\nis a group of Hispanic organizations focusing on redistricting and voter registration. The Texas State Conference of\nNAACP Branches and the League of United Latin American Citizens are civil rights and advocacy groups\nconcerned with minority voting rights in Texas.\n\n\n\n                                                            2\n\fchallenges the redistricting plans for the State Board of Education.3 Texas moved for summary\n\njudgment on September 14, 2011. The parties engaged in swift discovery, filed briefs and\n\nexhibits, and presented oral argument to this Court on November 2, 2011.\n\n                  A three-judge court in the Western District of Texas is currently hearing\n\nconstitutional challenges and challenges under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to these same\n\nredistricting Plans. Mindful of the fact that our refusal to grant preclearance would require that\n\ncourt to draw interim plans because of election-related deadlines in Texas, this Court issued an\n\norder denying summary judgment on all three Plans on November 8, 2011. See Dkt. # 106; see\n\nalso Perez v. Texas, No. 5:11-360, Am. Order [Dkt. # 391] (W. D. Tex. Oct. 4, 2011)\n\n(consolidated action); Davis v. Perry, No. 5:11-788, Am. Order [Dkt. # 15] (W. D. Tex. Oct. 4,\n\n2011). The Court now issues its Memorandum Opinion explaining its reasoning.\n\n                  B. Statutory Background\n\n                  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (“VRA”), Pub. L. No. 89-110, 79 Stat. 437\n\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1973 et seq.), was enacted to counteract attempts by states\n\nand local jurisdictions to evade the Reconstruction Amendments’ prohibitions on racial\n\ndiscrimination in voting.4 Litigation and court orders had been slow and often ineffective in\n\n3\n  The Texas State Board of Education (“BOE”) is composed of fifteen single-member districts. Texas claimed that\nthe benchmark plan for the BOE contained three Hispanic “opportunity” districts, with a Hispanic Citizen Voting\nAge Population (“HCVAP”) of greater than fifty percent, and two Black “opportunity” districts, with a Black Voting\nAge Population (“BVAP”) of greater than thirty percent. In the proposed BOE plan, Texas states that there are also\nthree Hispanic “opportunity” districts that have an HCVAP of greater than fifty percent, and two Black\n“opportunity” districts with BVAPs of greater than thirty percent. This Court provided the parties another\nopportunity to object to preclearance of the proposed BOE plan during a teleconference held on September 21, 2011.\nAfter no party voiced opposition, this Court entered declaratory judgment in favor of Texas on that plan on\nSeptember 22, 2011. See Minute Entry Order (Sept. 22, 2011). Consequently, the BOE plan is not in contention\nhere.\n4\n  The VRA was extended in 1975 to cover members of language minority groups, such as Hispanics. Through\nreference to 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(f)(2) in both subsections (a) and (b), Section 5 extends its protection to language\nminority groups:\n\n\n\n                                                          3\n\fcurbing the egregious abuses that jurisdictions had used to impede minority voters in the exercise\n\nof their constitutionally protected rights. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 313-14\n\n(1966). The VRA contains a set of “sterner and more elaborate measures” that Congress found\n\nnecessary to fight the “insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetrated in certain parts of\n\nour country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.” Id. at 309.\n\n                 The VRA contains a complex remedial scheme “aimed at areas where voting\n\ndiscrimination has been most flagrant.” Id. at 315. These targeted, temporary remedial measures\n\napply to a state or local political body that is a “covered” jurisdiction as defined by Section 4(b)\n\nof the VRA, i.e., one that has been found, according to a statutory formula, to have engaged in\n\nvoting discrimination. See 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(b); Riley v. Kennedy, 553 U.S. 406, 413 (2008).\n\nSection 5 is one of those temporary remedial measures. It was enacted as “a response to a\n\ncommon practice in some jurisdictions of staying one step ahead of the federal courts by passing\n\nnew discriminatory voting laws as the old ones had been struck down.” Beer v. United States,\n\n425 U.S. 130, 140 (1976) (quoting H.R. REP. No. 94-196, at 57-58 (1970)).\n\n                 Section 5 requires covered jurisdictions to obtain preclearance for any changes to\n\nvoting qualifications, requirements, standards, practices, or procedures either administratively\n\nfrom the Attorney General or from the District Court for the District of Columbia. Section 5\n\nplaces the burden of proof on the covered jurisdiction to show that the planned change “neither\n\nhas the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of\n\n\n\n            No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure\n            shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge\n            the right of any citizen of the United States to vote because he is a member of a\n            language minority group.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1976b(f)(2).\n\n\n\n                                                        4\n\frace or color, or [membership in a language minority group].” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a). Subsection\n\n1973c(b) of the statute further provides that:\n\n                 Any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard,\n                 practice, or procedure with respect to voting that has the purpose of\n                 or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of\n                 the United States on account of race or color, or [membership in a\n                 language minority group], to elect their preferred candidates of\n                 choice denies or abridges the right to vote . . . .\n\nId. § 1973c(b). The goal of subsection 1973c(b) “is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect\n\ntheir preferred candidates of choice.” Id. § 1973c(d). In addition, the statute further explains\n\nthat “[t]he term ‘purpose’. . . shall include any discriminatory purpose.” Id. § 1973c(c). No\n\nchange to a voting practice or procedure, including an electoral redistricting plan, see Miller v.\n\nJohnson, 515 U.S. 900, 905-06 (1995), may be implemented until preclearance is granted. Reno\n\nv. Bossier Parish School Bd. (Bossier I), 520 U.S. 471, 477-78 (1997).\n\n                 Section 5 originally was intended to be in effect for only five years, but Congress\n\nhas re-authorized it four times, most recently in 2006 for twenty-five years.5 Nw. Austin Mun.\n\nUtil. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 2510 (2009). During the 2006 reauthorization,\n\nCongress amended the statute to clarify what it meant by “effect” and “purpose” under Section 5,\n\nShelby Cnty. v. Holder, No. 10-cv-651, 2011 WL 4375001, at *10-11 (D.D.C. Sept. 21, 2011),\n\nand added language to emphasize that a Section 5 inquiry must focus on whether a proposed\n\nchange will “diminish[]” the ability of minority voters “to elect their preferred candidates of\n\nchoice.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b), (d); H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 46 (2006) (“Thus, in amending\n\nSection 5 to add a new subsection (b), the Committee makes clear that in making preclearance\n5\n  On July 27, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, & Coretta Scott\nKing Voting Rights Reauthorization & Amendments Act of 2006 (“2006 Amendments”), Pub. L. No. 109-246, 120\nStat. 577 (2006). This legislation was passed by a vote of 390-33 by the U.S. House of Representatives, and 98-0 by\nthe Senate.\n\n\n\n                                                        5\n\fdeterminations under Section 5, the comparative ‘ability [of the minority community] to elect\n\npreferred candidates of choice’ is the relevant factor to be evaluated . . . .” (alterations in\n\noriginal)).6 Speaking broadly, Congress proscribed “any” change that would have such an\n\n“effect” because such a change “denies or abridges the right to vote.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b).\n\nThus, a covered jurisdiction will not meet the requirements of Section 5 when a proposed change\n\nto a voting procedure or plan would have a retrogressive effect on the “ability” of minority voters\n\nto elect candidates of their choice. Id.\n\n                 The 2006 Amendments also proscribe “any” change that “has the purpose of”\n\ndiminishing the ability of minority voters to elect candidates of their choice. Congress sought to\n\nensure that “purpose” was no longer limited to a “retrogressive purpose,” as the Supreme Court\n\nhad held in Reno v. Bossier (Bossier II), 528 U.S. 320 (2000), see 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b)-(c); H.R.\n\nREP. NO. 109-478, at 46, but covered more broadly “any discriminatory purpose.” 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973c(c) (emphasis added).\n\n                 Defendants challenge both the effect of and the purpose behind Texas’\n\nredistricting Plans. In particular, this lawsuit focuses on the Plans’ effect on Hispanic and Black\n\nvoters in Texas and whether these Plans were enacted with a discriminatory purpose aimed at\n\nsuch voters. For the purposes of the VRA, Hispanic citizens are treated as members of a\n\nlanguage minority group. See 42 U.S.C. § 1973l(c)(3) (“‘[L]anguage minority group’ means\n\npersons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage.”).\n\n\n\n\n6\n  The House Committee on the Judiciary reported H.R. 9, the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, & Coretta Scott King\nVoting Rights Reauthorization & Amendments Act of 2006, out of Committee by a vote of 33-1. There was no\ndissenting minority opinion to the Committee Report.\n\n\n                                                      6\n\f                       1. “Effects” Analysis\n\n               The Section 5 evaluation of whether a new procedure has “the effect of denying\n\nor abridging the right to vote” is not a question of constitutional law but of statutory\n\nconstruction, and is dependent on congressional intent. Beer, 425 U.S. at 139-40. By enacting\n\nSection 5, Congress aimed to guarantee that minorities’ new gains in political participation\n\nwould not be undone. Id. at 140-41. Thus, the Supreme Court has found that the “purpose of\n\n[Section] 5 has always been to insure that no voting-procedure changes would be made that\n\nwould lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective\n\nexercise of the electoral franchise.” Id. at 141 (emphasis added); see 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(d)\n\n(“The purpose of [§ 1973(b)] is to protect the ability of such [minority] citizens to elect their\n\npreferred candidates of choice.”).\n\n               Determining whether a new voting plan diminishes the ability to elect and thus\n\nhas a retrogressive effect on minority voting rights necessarily requires a comparison between\n\nthe voting plan in place and the proposed plan. Bossier I, 520 U.S. at 478. A covered\n\njurisdiction’s existing plan serves as the “benchmark” against which the “‘effect’ of voting\n\nchanges is measured.” Id. The Supreme Court has instructed that Section 5 is not ameliorative\n\nand the focus of its retrogression analysis is on “freezing election procedures in the covered areas\n\nunless the changes can be shown to be nondiscriminatory.” Beer, 425 U.S. at 140 (quoting H.R.\n\nREP. NO. 94-196, at 57-58) (internal quotation marks omitted). If a plan does not increase the\n\ndegree of discrimination against a minority voting population, it is entitled to preclearance. City\n\nof Lockhart v. United States, 460 U.S. 125, 134-35 (1987). For example, plans that preserve or\n\nactually increase minority voting strength should be precleared unless they have a discriminatory\n\npurpose. See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 477 (2003) (quoting Lockhart, 460 U.S. at 134\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fn.10; Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 983 (1996)); Beer, 425 U.S. at 141 (holding that an\n\n“ameliorative new legislative apportionment cannot violate [Section] 5 unless . . . [it] so\n\ndiscriminates on the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution”).\n\n               Beer described Section 5 as requiring covered jurisdictions to protect minority\n\ngroups’ “effective exercise of the electoral franchise,” which meant the “ability of minority\n\ngroups to participate in the political process and to elect their candidate of choice.” 425 U.S. at\n\n141 (emphasis added). Although the Supreme Court used this phrase in subsequent decisions, it\n\nwas not until Georgia v. Ashcroft that the Court provided further explanation of its reasoning.\n\nGeorgia v. Ashcroft placed greater emphasis on minority participation in electoral politics,\n\nholding that a “court should not focus solely on the comparative ability of a minority group to\n\nelect a candidate of its choice” but should look to the “totality of the circumstances” regarding\n\nvoter participation, including “the extent of the minority group’s opportunity to participate in the\n\npolitical process.” 539 U.S. at 479-80 (emphasis added). Using this analysis, the Court stated\n\nthat Section 5 accommodates choices by covered jurisdictions among systems of representation\n\nwhen redistricting, i.e., a jurisdiction may create “safe” majority-minority districts that may\n\n“virtually guarantee the election of a minority group’s preferred candidate”; it may create\n\ndistricts where a coalition of voters “will help to achieve the electoral aspirations of the minority\n\ngroup”; or it may add “influence districts,” where minorities play a “substantial, if not decisive,\n\nrole in the electoral process.” Id. at 480-83. The Supreme Court concluded that the lower\n\ncourt’s retrogression analysis had focused too much on decreases in the Black population in\n\nmajority-minority districts and had not properly credited increases in coalition and influence\n\ndistricts under Georgia’s proposed redistricting plan, which could offset potential losses in\n\nmajority-minority districts. Id. at 486-87.\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f               Congress disagreed with this analysis and amended Section 5 in response to\n\nGeorgia v. Ashcroft during the VRA’s 2006 reauthorization. See H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 45;\n\nS. REP. NO. 109-295, at 18 (2006); see also LaRoque v. Holder, 650 F.3d 777, 794 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011); Shelby Cnty., 2011 WL 4375001, at *11. The 2006 Amendments clarified that Congress\n\nintended a Section 5 inquiry to focus on whether a proposed voting change will diminish the\n\n“ability [of minority citizens] to elect preferred candidates of choice.” H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at\n\n46 (emphasis added). Thus, Congress specified that any change that has the effect of\n\ndiminishing citizens’ ability to elect a candidate of their choice on account of race, color, or\n\nmembership in a language minority group “denies or abridges the right to vote” within the\n\nmeaning of Section 5. 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b); H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 46.\n\n               By these Amendments, Congress sought to make clear that it was not enough that\n\na redistricting plan gave minority voters “influence”; a plan cannot diminish their ability to elect\n\ncandidates. The House Report opined that leaving the Georgia v. Ashcroft standard in place\n\nwould encourage states to disperse minority voters into different voting districts under an\n\n“influence” label and that gains made by minority voters in districts where they were represented\n\nby the candidate of their choice would be jeopardized. H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 45.\n\n                       2. “Purpose” Analysis\n\n               Section 5 also prohibits covered jurisdictions from implementing a plan that is\n\nenacted with the “purpose” of “denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color,\n\nor [membership in a language minority].” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c. In Bossier II, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that a plan animated by a discriminatory purpose could nonetheless merit preclearance if its\n\npurpose was something other than to diminish a minority group’s ability to elect their preferred\n\ncandidates. The government conceded that the plan proffered by the covered jurisdiction did not\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fhave a retrogressive effect on the voting ability of the minority population. 528 U.S. at 324. The\n\ngovernment argued that the Court should nonetheless deny preclearance because facts\n\ndemonstrated that the plan was enacted with discriminatory intent. Id. at 328. In a 5-4 decision,\n\nthe Supreme Court concluded that “the ‘purpose’ prong of § 5 covers only retrogressive\n\ndilution.” Id. In other words, Section 5 only prohibited plans that were enacted with the purpose\n\nto reduce minorities’ ability to elect — whether or not retrogression actually occurred. Section 5\n\ndid not, however, “prohibit preclearance of a redistricting plan enacted with a discriminatory but\n\nnon-retrogressive purpose.” Id. at 341.\n\n               In the 2006 Amendments, Congress clarified that the “purpose” requirement of\n\nSection 5 prohibits not only voting plans enacted with a retrogressive purpose, but also plans\n\ndevised with “any discriminatory purpose.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(c). The House Report\n\ncharacterized Bossier II as a severe limitation on the reach of the “purpose” prong, through\n\nwhich “Congress [had] sought to prevent covered jurisdictions from enacting and enforcing\n\nvoting changes made with a clear racial animus, regardless of the measurable impact of such\n\ndiscriminatory changes.” H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 42. According to the House Report,\n\nCongress intended to restore the pre-Bossier II discriminatory purpose standard:\n\n               Voting changes that “purposefully” keep minority groups “in their\n               place” have no role in our electoral process and are precisely the\n               types of changes Section 5 is intended to bar. To allow otherwise\n               would be contrary to the protections afforded by the 14th and 15th\n               [A]mendment[s] and the VRA. Thus, by clarifying that any voting\n               change motivated by any discriminatory purpose is prohibited\n               under Section 5, the Committee seeks to ensure that the “purpose”\n               prong remains a vital element to ensuring that Section 5 remains\n               effective.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fId. at 43. To that end, Congress endorsed the framework in Village of Arlington Heights v.\n\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), to determine “whether voting\n\nchanges submitted for preclearance were motivated by a discriminatory purpose.” Id. Prior to\n\nBossier II, courts had relied upon the factors set forth in Arlington Heights to assess whether a\n\ncovered jurisdiction’s proposed change to its voting procedures was based upon a discriminatory\n\npurpose. See Arizona v. Reno, 887 F. Supp. 318, 322 (D.D.C. 1995); Busbee v. Smith, 549 F.\n\nSupp. 494, 516-17 (D.D.C. 1982), aff’d, 459 U.S. 1166 (1983). Indeed, Bossier I instructed\n\nlower courts conducting a Section 5 analysis to “look to . . . Arlington Heights for guidance,”\n\nwhere the Court had “set forth a framework for analyzing ‘whether invidious discriminatory\n\npurpose was a motivating factor’ in a government body’s decisionmaking.” 520 U.S. at 488\n\n(quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266). The legislative history to the 2006 Amendments\n\nand reauthorization of the VRA demonstrate congressional agreement with that approach.\n\n               Arlington Heights was not a Voting Rights Act case. It involved the refusal of the\n\nVillage of Arlington Heights, Illinois, to re-zone a tract of land for low-income housing, which\n\nwas challenged as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In\n\nreaching its decision in favor of the Village, the Supreme Court identified multiple factors to\n\nassess whether the Village’s purpose was discriminatory. 429 U.S. at 267-68. The Court\n\ncautioned that “[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor\n\ndemands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be\n\navailable.” Id. at 266; see also Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 546 (1999) (describing such an\n\ninquiry as “an inherently complex endeavor”).\n\n               “[A]n important starting point,” the Court directed, is to consider whether the\n\nchallenged action “bears more heavily on one race than another.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at\n\n\n                                                11\n\f266 (quoting Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn “easy” cases, “a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges from the\n\neffect of the state action even when the governing legislation appears neutral on its face.” Id.\n\n(citations omitted). That said, absent a pattern of discrimination which is “stark,” an action’s\n\n“impact alone is not determinative, and the Court must look to other evidence.” Id. (footnote\n\nomitted). Courts should consider “[t]he historical background of the decision . . . particularly if\n\nit reveals a series of official actions taken for invidious purposes”; “[t]he specific sequence of\n\nevents leading up [to] the challenged decision [which] also may shed some light on the\n\ndecisionmaker’s purposes”; and “[t]he legislative or administrative history,” which can be\n\n“highly relevant . . . where there are contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking\n\nbody, minutes of its meetings, or reports.” Id. at 267-68.\n\n                  C. Parties’ Arguments Regarding the Legal Standard to Measure\n                     Retrogressive Effect\n\n                  Texas and the Defendants contest the standard for measuring whether a proposed\n\nredistricting plan would have a retrogressive effect on minority voters’ ability to elect their\n\ncandidates of choice. Texas relies on voting population demographics alone. In both its\n\nbenchmark and proposed plans, Texas counted as ability districts, which it calls “opportunity\n\ndistricts,” 7 those districts in which Blacks make up forty percent of the voting-age population\n\nand Hispanics make up fifty percent of the citizen voting-age population. Texas omitted\n7\n   Texas’ use of “opportunity district” connotes a measure of uncertainty that is not supported by the language of the\nVRA. “Opportunity” denotes conditions that are “favorable” to such an outcome. See WEBSTER’S INTERNATIONAL\nNEW DICTIONARY 1583 (3d ed. 2002) (defining “opportunity” as “a combination of circumstances, time, and place\nsuitable or favorable for a particular activity or action” (emphasis added)). The statutory standard is whether\nminorities have an “ability to elect” a preferred candidate. An “ability” denotes the “the physical, mental, or legal\npower to perform,” id. at 3, a concept that requires a greater degree of certainty that an event can occur. Thus, in\nline with the language of Section 5, this Court references “ability districts” as districts that afford minority voters the\nelectoral power protected under Section 5. This term is used both for districts that have afforded minority voters the\nability to elect their preferred candidate in the past and those that predictively will do so in the future.\n\n\n\n                                                            12\n\fconsideration of all other factors. The United States, joined by all Intervenors, argues for a\n\nmulti-factored “functional” analysis, which starts with an examination of voting-age population\n\nbut also analyzes additional factors. See Guidance Concerning Redistricting Under Section 5 of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 7470 (Feb. 9, 2011).\n\n               Texas contends that the 2006 Amendments to Section 5 provide that covered\n\njurisdictions need only maintain those districts where minority voters can control the election\n\nand posits that majority-minority districts are best suited to accomplish this goal. Texas relied on\n\nvoting-age population statistics to ensure that its proposed redistricting Plans were not\n\nretrogressive. Texas explains that each of its Plans maintains at least the same number of\n\ndistricts as in the benchmark plans in which a specified minority constitutes a percentage of\n\neligible voters sufficient to determine the outcome of elections. Texas sets this percentage at\n\nmore than fifty percent of the citizen voting-age population for Hispanics (“HCVAP”) and forty\n\npercent of the voting-age population for Blacks (“BVAP”) in the State. Texas “defines ‘ability\n\nto elect’ districts based upon . . . demographic data indicating [that] a [single] cohesive racial or\n\nethnic group has the ability to elect candidates of their choice — whether or not the candidate\n\nreceives support from other voters in the district.” Pl.’s Reply [Dkt. # 92] at 27. Thus, Texas’\n\narguments that its Plans have no retrogressive effect are solely based upon data measuring\n\nminority voting-age population.\n\n               Defendants challenge this logic and its results. All Defendants ask this Court to\n\nconclude, consistent with the guidance issued by the DOJ in 2011 (“2011 DOJ Guidance”), that\n\nthere is no single measure that determines minorities’ ability to elect:\n\n               In determining whether the ability to elect exists in the benchmark\n               plan and whether it continues in the proposed plan, the Attorney\n               General does not rely on any predetermined or fixed demographic\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f                   percentages at any point in the assessment.” See [2011 DOJ\n                   Guidance]. Determining whether the ability to elect exists\n                   “requires a functional analysis of the electoral behavior within the\n                   particular jurisdiction or election district.” Id. Besides population,\n                   this includes an examination of election history and voting patterns\n                   within the jurisdiction, voter registration and turnout information.8\n\nU.S. Mem. [Dkt. # 79] at 6; see Intervenors’ Joint Mem. [Dkt # 74] at 7.\n\n                   Although the United States relies on the multi-factored 2011 DOJ Guidance, the\n\ntest it offered to measure retrogression, while more comprehensive than Texas’ approach, still\n\nrelied upon a limited set of data. Using data compiled by the State, the United States’ expert, Dr.\n\nLisa Handley, performed a functional election analysis in which she assessed data on statewide\n\nelections and elections within specific voting districts in order to identify which districts afford\n\nminority voters the ability to elect. She then recompiled data on certain statewide elections\n\nbased upon the proposed new boundaries of voting districts and determined how often minority-\n\npreferred candidates would succeed in the redrawn districts. The United States used this data to\n\nassert that minority groups’ ability to elect would be lost in certain proposed congressional and\n\nState House districts.\n\n                   The Intervenors also take issue with Texas’ view that all districts where Hispanic\n\nvoters constitute a majority of the citizen voting-age population or Black voters constitute forty\n\n8\n    The 2011 DOJ Guidance indicates that the DOJ also assesses:\n\n                   whether minority concentrations are fragmented among different districts;\n                   whether minorities are overconcentrated in one or more districts; whether\n                   alternative plans satisfying the jurisdiction’s legitimate governmental interests\n                   exist, and whether they were considered; whether the proposed plan departs\n                   from objective redistricting criteria set by the submitting jurisdiction, ignores\n                   other relevant factors such as compactness and contiguity, or displays a\n                   configuration that inexplicably disregards available natural or artificial\n                   boundaries; and, whether the plan is inconsistent with the jurisdiction’s stated\n                   redistricting standards.\n\n76 Fed. Reg. 7470-01, at 7472.\n\n\n\n                                                          14\n\fpercent of the voting-age population are ipso facto “ability to elect” districts. They advocate for\n\na multi-factored approach that accounts for:\n\n                      the size of a district’s minority population considering citizenship rates;\n\n                      voting-age population and voter registration;\n\n                      the extent of racially polarized voting;\n\n                      the presence of electoral coalitions involving minority voters;\n\n                      the role of incumbency in past elections;\n\n                      factors that affect turnout rates by race; and\n\n                      recent electoral trends.\n\nIntevenors’ Joint Mem. at 6-7.\n\n               All Defendants contend that Section 5 protections are not limited to districts\n\nwhere a single minority group has the ability to elect its candidate of choice, but extend to\n\ndistricts where one group of minority voters joins together with voters of a different racial or\n\nlanguage background to elect the minority voters’ candidate of choice. The United States points\n\nto language in the House Report accompanying the 2006 Amendments explaining that Section 5\n\nprotects minorities’ ability to elect candidates of choice either “directly or coalesced with other\n\nvoters.” U.S. Mem. at 14 (quoting H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 46). Defendants urge this Court to\n\nconclude that the proposed Plans are retrogressive because they do not account for the loss of\n\ncoalition districts, while Texas contends that such districts are not protected under the VRA.\n\n               Defendants also argue that where, as in Texas, a proposed plan contains an\n\nincreased number of voting districts, the percentage of minority ability districts in the proposed\n\nplan should be measured against the percentage of minority ability districts in the benchmark\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fplan. Defendants ask this Court to find that the Congressional Plan is retrogressive because it\n\nincreases the number of electoral districts (in significant part because of the increase in the\n\nHispanic population in Texas), but allegedly does not increase the number of ability districts for\n\nHispanic voters.\n\n                 Finally, the Intervenors, most specifically the Texas Legislative Black Caucus\n\n(“TLBC”), the League of United Latin American Citizens (“LULAC”), and the Texas State\n\nConference of NAACP Branches, assert that Section 5 not only protects against the\n\ndiminishment of an existing ability to elect, but also the diminishment of an emerging ability to\n\nelect. These Intervenors contend that Section 5’s retrogression standard must include an\n\nassessment of whether redistricting forestalls emerging minority electoral opportunities in\n\nbenchmark districts. They argue that, because a retrogression analysis under Section 5 in some\n\nmeasure looks to the future effect of changes in voting practices, it must protect against the\n\nreduction of predictable future gains in minority voting strength.\n\n                 D. Parties’ Arguments Regarding the Contested Plans\n\n                 Applying their own respective retrogression analyses, the parties dispute the\n\nalleged retrogressive effect that Texas’ proposed restricting Plans will have on minority voters’\n\nability to elect their candidates of choice. The parties’ comparison of the benchmark plans, i.e.,\n\nthe most recent electoral plans in effect for the U.S. House of Representatives, Texas State\n\nSenate, and Texas House of Representatives,9 with Texas’ proposed redistricting Plans leads\n\n\n9\n  Texas identified the following benchmark plans. For the U.S. House of Representatives, the State identified plan\nC100, which was implemented in 2006 by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in LULAC v.\nPerry, 457 F. Supp. 2d. 716 (E.D. Tex. 2006). For the Texas House of Representatives, it identified plan H100,\nwhich was implemented in 2001 by the same district court in Balderas v. Texas, No. 01-158, Final Judgment [Dkt #\n458] (E.D. Tex. Nov. 28, 2001). For the Texas State Senate, it identified plan S100, which was implemented in\n2001 after it received preclearance from the DOJ.\n\n\n\n                                                        16\n\fthem to dispute which districts should be counted as minority ability districts in both the\n\nbenchmark and proposed Plans.10\n\n                           1. The Congressional Plan\n\n                  In its analysis of the benchmark congressional districts, Texas identified, out of a\n\ntotal of thirty-two districts, seven Hispanic ability districts, each of which allegedly has an\n\nHCVAP of more than fifty percent.11 Texas concedes that under the proposed Congressional\n\nPlan, Congressional District (“CD”) 27 would no longer be an ability district for Hispanics.\n\nTexas counters that this loss is more than offset by two new Hispanic ability districts:\n\napproximately 71.7 percent of the citizen voting age population of CD 34 will be Hispanic; 51.9\n\npercent of CD 35 will be as well. As a result, Texas asserts that its proposed Congressional Plan\n\nwill add one Hispanic ability district, increasing the number of Hispanic ability districts from\n\nseven to eight. The proposed Congressional Plan will thus, according to Texas, ameliorate rather\n\nthan retrogress Hispanic voting power in the State.\n\n                  Texas also asserts that Black voting power in the State will be enhanced under the\n\nCongressional Plan. Currently, only CD 18 has a BVAP of more than forty percent. With the\n\nnew plan, CD 30 will also.12\n\n                  The United States agrees that the proposed Congressional Plan does not retrogress\n\nBlack voting power, and appears to credit Texas with three (not just two) Black ability\n\n10\n   For example, Texas identified eight minority ability districts in the benchmark congressional plan while the\nUnited States identified ten. Likewise, Texas identified forty-three minority ability districts in the benchmark plan\nfor the Texas House while the United States identified fifty.\n11\n  Texas identified Congressional Districts 15, 16, 20, 23, 27, 28, and 29 as Hispanic ability districts in the\nbenchmark.\n12\n   Without explaining its relevance, Texas also points out that CD 9, which has a more than thirty percent but less\nthan forty percent BVAP, will maintain that percentage under the proposed plan.\n\n\n\n                                                          17\n\fcongressional districts in the Congressional Plan. According to the United States, CDs 9, 18, and\n\n30 are, and will remain, Black ability districts in both the benchmark and the proposed plan. The\n\nUnited States argues, however, that Hispanic voting power will retrogress under the proposed\n\nCongressional Plan because: 1) Texas’ Congressional Plan does not create any new Hispanic\n\nability districts, despite a significant increase in the Hispanic population and four new\n\ncongressional districts in the State; and 2) CD 23, which Texas counts as a Hispanic ability\n\ndistrict under the benchmark, would not be an ability district in the proposed plan.\n\n               Both the United States and Texas agree that the proposed Congressional Plan\n\nwould include at least seven Hispanic ability districts (CDs 15, 16, 20, 28, 29, 34, and 35) and\n\nthat CD 27, which was a Hispanic ability district under the benchmark, would lose this status.\n\nThe parties dispute the status of CD 23 under the proposed plan. Although both agree that CD\n\n23 is a Hispanic ability district under the benchmark, they disagree as to its status under the\n\nproposed plan. Texas asserts that CD 23 will continue to be a Hispanic ability district in the\n\nproposed plan because it will have an HCVAP of 58.5 percent. The United States argues that\n\nCD 23’s new boundaries, which will allegedly include Hispanics with lower voter turnout, will\n\nactually decrease Hispanic voter participation and diminish their ability to elect. However, the\n\nUnited States agrees that the alleged addition of CDs 34 and 35 as Hispanic ability districts in the\n\nproposed Congressional Plan would provide Texas with seven total Hispanic ability districts\n\nunder the proposed plan.\n\n               The Gonzales Intervenors argue that CD 25 should be counted in the benchmark\n\nas a minority ability district and that the proposed Congressional Plan has a retrogressive effect\n\non this district. They argue, with no opposition from Texas, that Hispanic, Black, and fifty\n\npercent of White voters in CD 25 have voted cohesively in support of minority preferred\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fcandidates. But CD 25 will lose large numbers of minority voters in the proposed plan, and\n\nthese voters will be replaced by an influx of White voters whose voting behavior differs\n\nsubstantially from the Whites who voted with minorities in the benchmark.\n\n                  Finally, the United States and several Intervenors assert that the proposed\n\nCongressional Plan is retrogressive because it fails to recognize adequately the significance of\n\nthe Hispanic contribution to Texas’ population growth in the last decade. According to the 2010\n\nCensus, the population of the State has grown by over four million people since 2000, of which\n\napproximately two-thirds are Hispanics. This population surge has resulted in a gain of four\n\nseats in the U.S. House of Representatives, increasing the number of Texas delegates from thirty-\n\ntwo to thirty-six, an increase unprecedented for a state fully covered by Section 5. U.S. Mem. at\n\n22 n.9. Despite the historic increase in the number of congressional seats, these Defendants\n\nargue that Texas drafted a redistricting plan that creates no new Hispanic ability districts. They\n\nargue that this is sufficient evidence that the proposed Congressional Plan is retrogressive,\n\nbecause maintaining at seven the number of Hispanic ability districts in the face of this surge in\n\nHispanic population would reduce the proportion of Hispanic ability districts in Texas’\n\ncongressional delegation.13 Texas responds that a redistricting plan that preserves the pre-\n\nexisting number of minority ability districts will always satisfy Section 5’s retrogression\n\nstandard.\n\n\n\n\n13\n   The United States and the Latino Redistricting Task Force Intervenors calculate that Hispanic voters have the\nability to elect preferred candidates in 21.9 percent of the benchmark districts but only in 19.4 percent of the districts\nin the Congressional Plan.\n\n\n\n                                                           19\n\f                           2. The Texas House of Representatives Plan\n\n                  In the benchmark plan for the Texas House of Representatives, Texas identifies\n\nthirty districts out of a total of 150 that have an HCVAP of more than fifty percent, which, by\n\nTexas’ measure, afford Hispanic citizens the ability to elect their candidates of choice.14\n\nAccording to Texas, the proposed State House Plan will also have thirty districts that have an\n\nHCVAP of more than fifty percent, allegedly maintaining the same number of Hispanic ability\n\ndistricts as in the benchmark. Texas concedes that State House District (“HD”) 33, which is\n\ncurrently a Hispanic ability district under the benchmark plan, will no longer be such a district in\n\nthe proposed State House Plan. Texas claims, however, that “new” HD 148 will offset that loss.\n\nWith regard to the Black minority population, Texas identifies eleven districts in the benchmark\n\nplan that have a BVAP of more than forty percent, and twelve districts with the same BVAP of\n\nmore than forty percent in the proposed State House Plan. The proposed plan adds HD 27 as a\n\nnew Black ability district. Based on these population statistics, Texas contends that its proposed\n\nState House Plan will not have a retrogressive effect on the ability of Hispanic or Black voters to\n\nelect their candidates of choice to the Texas House of Representatives.\n\n                  The United States and several Intervenors, however, disagree. Notably, the\n\nUnited States does not believe the proposed State House Plan would retrogress Black voting\n\npower.15 However, according to the United States and several Intervenors, the State House Plan\n\nwould retrogress Hispanic voting power. Based on its retrogression analysis, the United States\n\n\n14\n   The thirty Hispanic ability districts that Texas identifies in the House benchmark plan are districts 31, 33-43, 74-\n80, 104, 116, 117-119, 123-125, 140, 143, and 145.\n15\n  The United States identifies twelve Black ability districts under the benchmark plan, 22, 95, 100, 109-111, 131,\n139, 141, 142, 146, and 147. It identifies HD 27 as a new Black ability district in the proposed State House Plan,\nwhich brings its count of such districts to thirteen under the proposed plan.\n\n\n\n                                                          20\n\fidentifies thirty-four Hispanic ability districts under the benchmark plan, of which three or four\n\nwill allegedly be lost in the proposed State House Plan.16\n\n                  Additionally, Dr. Handley opines that of four “coalition districts” in the\n\nbenchmark, where minorities have been able to elect their candidates of choice by uniting with\n\nother minority groups, two — HD 149 and HD 27 — will be lost. In HD 149, a coalition of\n\nHispanic, Black, and Asian voters has repeatedly elected its candidate of choice since 2004, but\n\nthat ability would be lost under the proposed State House Plan. Although Dr. Handley also\n\nidentified HD 27 as a coalition district in the benchmark, she noted that it would change to a\n\nBlack ability district under the proposed plan. Due to alleged fracturing in these districts, the\n\nUnited States anticipates a loss of four to five minority ability districts, i.e., HDs 33, 35, 41, 117,\n\nand 149, in the State House Plan.\n\n                  As noted, most Intervenors agree with the United States. In addition, Intervenors\n\nTLBC, LULAC, and the Texas State Conference of NAACP Branches argue that, under the State\n\nHouse Plan, minority voting power would be diminished in HDs 26, 101, 106, and 144, each of\n\nwhich was on the verge of becoming a minority ability district under the benchmark.\n\n                           3. The Texas State Senate Plan\n\n                  Out of a total of thirty-one State Senate districts, Texas identifies seven Hispanic\n\nability districts under the benchmark plan in which there is an HCVAP of greater than fifty\n\n\n\n\n16\n   The United States asserts that Hispanic voters would lose the ability to elect their candidate of choice in HDs 33,\n35, and 117 due to the reconfiguration of the Hispanic population in each district and racially polarized voting.\nAdditionally, the government states that Hispanic voters may also lose their ability to elect in HD 41. The\ngovernment’s expert was “unable to make a determination” regarding this district. U.S. Mem., Ex. 4 [Dkt. # 79-6]\nat 1 n.1 (Handley House Report). Texas argues that HDs 35, 41, and 117 will remain majority-minority, although\nthere will be a decrease in HCVAP in HDs 35 and 41.\n\n\n                                                          21\n\fpercent,17 and claims the same number based on the same districts in the proposed State Senate\n\nPlan. Additionally, Texas identifies two Black ability districts with a BVAP of more than forty\n\npercent under the benchmark plan, each of which remains such in the proposed State Senate\n\nPlan.18 The United States has similarly concluded that the proposed State Senate Plan is not\n\nretrogressive.\n\n                    However, the Davis Intervenors allege that the State Senate Plan is retrogressive\n\nbecause it fractures Black and Hispanic communities that have formed a working coalition to\n\nelect their candidate of choice in Senate District (“SD”) 10.19 This is not a district deemed by\n\nTexas or the United States to be a minority ability district in the benchmark plan. However, the\n\nIntervenors claim both that it was an ability district in the benchmark and that, due to alleged\n\nfracturing of SD 10’s minority communities in the proposed State Senate Plan, minority voters in\n\nthis district will no longer be able to elect their candidate of choice. Texas “refutes any argument\n\nthat [SD] 10 was ‘dismantled’” and further states that SD 10 “in both the benchmark plan and\n\n[the proposed plan] is a crossover district, and not even a particularly strong one. Such districts\n\nare not protected under the VRA.” Texas Reply to Senate [Dkt. # 90] at 5.\n\n                    Another group of Intervenors — TLBC, LULAC, and the Texas State Conference\n\nof NAACP Branches — argues that the proposed State Senate Plan will retrogress minority\n\nvoters’ ability to elect in SD 15. These Intervenors allege that the combined Black and Hispanic\n\n17\n   The Hispanic ability districts that Texas identifies in the State Senate benchmark plan are districts 6, 19-21, 26,\n27, and 29.\n18\n     The Black ability districts that Texas identifies in the State Senate benchmark plan are districts 13 and 23.\n19\n   The Davis Intervenors provide a statement from County Commissioner Roy Brooks that Black and Hispanic\nleaders “deliberately and aggressively recruited Wendy Davis to run in 2008 . . . . To elect our candidate of choice,\nBlacks and Hispanics had to come together and vote together, which we did.” Davis Statement of Facts [Dkt. # 76-\n2] at ¶ 4. The Davis Intervenors allege that Senator Davis was elected with ninety-nine percent of the Hispanic and\nBlack vote and that she only received thirty percent of the White vote. Id. at ¶ 6.\n\n\n                                                            22\n\fpercentage of total population in proposed SD 15 decreases from 72.3 percent to 66.7 percent\n\nand that such a decrease will be electorally significant. Texas argues in response that “[SD] 15\n\nwas not a protected district under the benchmark because it was not a majority-minority\n\ndistrict.”20 Texas Reply to Senate at 4. According to Texas, “In both the benchmark and [the\n\nproposed plan], [SD] 15 is a coalition district” and “such districts are not protected.” Id.\n\n                          II. STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n                 Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment shall\n\nbe granted “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the\n\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a); accord Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986); Talavera v. Shah, 638 F.3d 303, 308 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011). Moreover, summary judgment is properly granted against a party who “after adequate\n\ntime for discovery and upon motion . . . fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the\n\nexistence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the\n\nburden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).\n\n                 In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all justifiable\n\ninferences in the nonmoving party’s favor and accept the nonmoving party’s evidence as true.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255; Talavera, 638 F.3d at 308. A nonmoving party, however, must\n\nestablish more than “the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence” in support of its position.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 252. In addition, the nonmoving party may not rely solely on allegations\n\nor conclusory statements. Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999).

ANALYSIS\n\n                A. Summary Judgment is Inappropriate Because Texas Used an Incorrect\n                   Standard to Measure Retrogression\n\n                Texas urges this Court to rely solely on voter demographic data to identify\n\nmajority-minority districts and to count only such districts as minority ability districts. This\n\nCourt cannot oblige. We find that a simple voting-age population analysis cannot accurately\n\nmeasure minorities’ ability to elect and, therefore, that Texas misjudged which districts offer its\n\nminority citizens the ability to elect their preferred candidates in both its benchmark and\n\nproposed Plans. Since Texas used the wrong standard, there are material facts in dispute about\n\nwhich districts are minority ability districts in the benchmark and proposed Plans. On this\n\nrecord, we cannot determine whether the Plans will have a retrogressive effect on Texas’\n\nminority citizens’ ability to elect.\n\n                Beginning with Beer, the Supreme Court has addressed the relationship between\n\nmajority-minority districts and a minority group’s ability to elect, but has never suggested that\n\nthe inquiry required by Section 5 can be satisfied by examining only the number of majority-\n\nminority districts. In fact, the Court has acknowledged that the inquiry is a complex undertaking.\n\nSee Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 480 (“The ability of minority voters to elect a candidate of\n\ntheir choice is important but often complex in practice to determine.”); see also Holder v. Hall,\n\n512 U.S. 874, 883-84 (1994) (plurality opinion) (“[T]here may be difficulty in determining\n\nwhether a proposed change would cause retrogression . . . .”). Defendants correctly argue that\n\npopulation demographics provide only a valid starting point, and demonstrating that Hispanics or\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fanother minority group constitute a citizen voting-age majority in a district may well not suffice,\n\non its own, to demonstrate that they have the ability to elect. See, e.g., League of United Latin\n\nAm. Citizens v. Perry (LULAC), 548 U.S. 399, 428 (2006) (observing that “it may be possible for\n\na citizen voting-age majority to lack real electoral opportunity”). Texas has been able to provide\n\nno authority to support its reliance on a single-factor test, and we decline to depart from the clear\n\nguidance of the Supreme Court’s Section 5 precedent that assessing retrogression is a\n\nmultifaceted, fact-specific inquiry.\n\n                In rejecting Texas’ standard, this Court starts with the 2006 Amendments to\n\nSection 5. The fundamental question is whether any change proposed by Texas “will have the\n\neffect of diminishing the ability” of minorities “to elect” their preferred candidates. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973c(b). Should there be any doubt, Congress emphasized that the “purpose” of § 1973c(b) is\n\n“to protect the ability” of minority citizens “to elect their preferred candidates.” Id. § 1973c(d).\n\nClearly, “ability to elect” is the statutory watchword.\n\n                In making its Amendments, Congress sought to restore the “ability to elect”\n\nstandard promulgated by the Supreme Court in Beer. H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 45-46 (“[A]\n\nchange should be denied preclearance under Section 5 if it diminishes the ability of minority\n\ngroups to elect their candidates of choice. Such was the standard of analysis articulated by the\n\nSupreme Court in Beer v. United States . . . .”); see Beer, 425 U.S. at 141 (stating that the Section\n\n5 standard “can only be fully satisfied by determining . . . whether the ability of minority groups\n\nto participate in the political process and to elect their choices to office is . . . affected”). The\n\nHouse of Representatives identified significant benefits to minority communities under the Beer\n\nstandard. H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 45-46. In addition, the House Report specifically\n\ncommented that “[v]oting changes that leave a minority group less able to elect a preferred\n\n\n                                                   25\n\fcandidate of choice, either directly or when coalesced with other voters, cannot be precleared\n\nunder Section 5.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added).\n\n               Thus, “being able” or “having the power” to elect — in the past (the benchmark)\n\nand the future (a proposed redistricting plan) — is what matters under Section 5. This Court\n\nconcludes that a review of redistricting plans under Section 5 must be concerned with the\n\nfunctioning of the electorate, i.e., whether minority voters will be “effective [in their] exercise of\n\nthe electoral franchise.” Beer, 425 U.S. at 141.\n\n               Texas perceives “ability” and “opportunity” as interchangeable, but they represent\n\ndifferent concepts that serve different purposes. In its motion, Texas identifies minority\n\n“opportunity districts” as significant under Section 5. An “opportunity” to elect is meaningful\n\nunder Section 2 of the VRA, but not necessarily under Section 5.\n\n               Section 2 is violated upon a showing that minorities “have less opportunity than\n\nother members of the electorate to . . . elect representatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973(b). Section 2 “was designed as a means of eradicating voting practices that minimize or\n\ncancel out the voting strength and political effectiveness of minority groups”; thus, it “bars all\n\nStates and their political subdivisions from maintaining” any voting practice that, inter alia,\n\ndilutes the votes of minority citizens. Bossier I, 520 U.S. at 479 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted). A plaintiff claiming vote dilution under Section 2 must satisfy the three\n\n“Gingles factors:” 1) the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to\n\nconstitute a majority in a single member district; 2) the group is politically cohesive; and 3) there\n\nis sufficient bloc voting by the White majority to defeat the minority preferred candidate. Id. at\n\n479-80 (citing Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50-51 (1986)). Under the first Gingles factor,\n\na plaintiff must show that a sufficient minority population is present to have the potential or\n\n\n                                                   26\n\fopportunity to elect its preferred representative in a single member district. Bartlett v.\n\nStrickland, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 1243 (2009) (plurality opinion) (citing Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50 n.17).\n\nThat is, Section 2 concerns itself with the possibility of a minority group’s present, but\n\nunrealized, opportunity to elect. See Bossier I, 520 U.S. at 480 (“Because the very concept of\n\nvote dilution implies – and, indeed, necessitates – the existence of an ‘undiluted’ practice against\n\nwhich the fact of dilution may be measured, a § 2 plaintiff must also postulate a reasonable\n\nalternative voting practice to serve as the benchmark ‘undiluted’ voting practice.”). Without\n\nsuch a showing, there can be neither wrong nor remedy. Bartlett, 129 S. Ct. at 1243 (citing\n\nGrowe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 41 (1993)).\n\n                 Under Section 2, demographic data is necessarily geared towards identifying\n\nminority voters’ “opportunity” to elect. Thus, because Texas equates “opportunity” and “ability”\n\ndistricts, it relies on data analysis pertinent to Section 2 to sustain its analysis of retrogressive\n\neffect under Section 5. However, population demographics alone will not fully reveal whether\n\nminority citizens’ ability to elect is or will be present in a voting district. Demographics alone\n\ncannot identify all districts where the effective exercise of the electoral franchise by minority\n\ncitizens is present or may be diminished under a proposed plan within the meaning of Section\n\n5.21 See, e.g., LULAC, 548 U.S. at 428.\n\n                 The question of retrogressive effect under Section 5 looks at gains that have\n\nalready been realized by minority voters and protects them from future loss. A Section 5 claim\n\nrequires a determination of how and where minority citizens’ ability to elect is currently present\n\nin a covered jurisdiction and how it will manifest itself in a proposed plan. This requires\n21\n   Section 2 challenges are most often concerned with vote dilution claims. This Court uses case law from Section\n2 in this Section 5 analysis only as it speaks to circumstances that adversely impact minority citizens’ ability to\nelect.\n\n\n\n                                                        27\n\fidentifying districts in which minority citizens enjoy an existing ability to elect and comparing\n\nthe number of such districts in the benchmark to the number of such districts in a proposed plan\n\nto measure the proposed plan’s effect on minority citizens’ voting ability. See Bossier I, 520\n\nU.S. at 478 (“Retrogression, by definition, requires a comparison of a jurisdiction’s new voting\n\nplan with its existing plan.”). Determining where and how the ability to elect is present is a\n\ncareful inquiry. This Court finds that the simple voting-age population statistics used by Texas\n\nare insufficient, and we cannot be confident that Texas has properly identified existing ability\n\ndistricts in its benchmark or future ability districts under the proposed Plans. Therefore, this\n\nCourt can neither count the former nor compare them to the latter. There are no easy shortcuts in\n\nthis inquiry. In particular, language minority status or race does not constitute a simple proxy for\n\npartisan preference in gauging the ability to elect. See, e.g., Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 968 (“[T]o\n\nthe extent that race is used as a proxy for political characteristics, a racial stereotyping requiring\n\nstrict scrutiny is in operation.”).\n\n                B. The Correct Legal Standard Governing Retrogression Analysis\n\n                        1. Ability-to-Elect Factors\n\n                If population statistics alone are insufficient to determine the existence and\n\nlocation of ability districts, what factors are relevant to an inquiry into retrogressive effect under\n\nSection 5? Below we outline the types of factors that are relevant for this analysis. Our list of\n\nfactors is not exhaustive. It merely highlights the kinds of factors missing from the standard\n\nTexas used to seek preclearance.\n\n                At the outset, a court addressing a proposed voting plan under Section 5 must\n\ndetermine whether there is cohesive voting among minorities and whether minority/White\n\npolarization is present in the jurisdiction submitting the plan. See, e.g., Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539\n\n\n                                                  28\n\fU.S. at 485 (“[I]t is of course true that evidence of racial polarization is one of many factors\n\nrelevant in assessing whether a minority group is able to elect a candidate of choice . . . .”).\n\nPolarized voting occurs when minority and White communities cast ballots along racial or\n\nlanguage minority lines, voting in blocs. See H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 20. Polarized voting\n\nbetween minorities and Whites often renders minority voters powerless to elect their candidate of\n\nchoice because White voters will not cross over to elect a minority-preferred candidate. Id.\n\nFurthermore, polarized voting often signals that minority communities in fact prefer different\n\ncandidates than the majority and helps to identify districts in which minority voters are effective\n\nin electing their candidates of choice.\n\n                  Next, this Court agrees with all parties that population statistics are significant\n\nand an important starting point for a retrogression analysis. Drawing a district with a “safe”\n\nminority population can essentially guarantee electoral success for minority voters, regardless of\n\nchallenges posed by racially polarized voting. See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 480-81\n\n(noting that “majority-minority districts may virtually guarantee the election of a minority\n\ngroup’s preferred candidates in those districts”). Even when voting is polarized, a minority\n\ngroup that constitutes a supermajority in a district will likely have the ability to elect its chosen\n\ncandidate. A district with a minority voting majority of sixty-five percent (or more) essentially\n\nguarantees that, despite changes in voter turnout, registration, and other factors that affect\n\nparticipation at the polls, a cohesive minority group will be able to elect its candidate of choice.22\n\n\n22\n   The Supreme Court found a figure of sixty-five percent of total population to be reasonable to achieve a majority\nof eligible minority voters in a district. United Jewish Orgs. of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 164\n(1977). In a similar vein, the three-judge court in Mississippi v. United States, 490 F. Supp. 569 (D.D.C. 1979),\nassessing a Section 5 challenge, found that:\n\n                  Low black voter registration and voter turn-out combined with racial bloc voting\n                  make it necessary for an electoral district in Mississippi to contain a substantial\n\n\n                                                         29\n\fWhere such a circumstance is present, there would be no need to make further inquiries into\n\nminority voters’ ability to elect. However, when there is no supermajority in a district, a Section\n\n5 analysis must go beyond mere population data to include factors such as minority voter\n\nregistration, minority voter turnout, election history, and minority/majority voting behaviors.23\n\n                  Determining that minorities have an ability to elect based solely on their numbers\n\nin the voting population of a district cannot account for the most fundamental concern of Section\n\n5: the effect past discrimination has on current electoral power. 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(b); see Riley,\n\n553 U.S. at 412 (noting that a jurisdiction is covered under Section 5 if among other things, “on\n\none of three specified coverage dates . . . it maintained a literacy requirement or other ‘test or\n\ndevice’ as a prerequisite to voting”). As the Intervenors note, historical discrimination against\n\nHispanics in Texas has, in some areas of the State, continued to depress their educational and\n\neconomic conditions such that the mere attainment of citizen voting-age status might have no\n\nreal effect on their ability to elect representatives of choice. See Latino Redistricting Task\n\n                  majority of black eligible voters in order to provide black voters with an\n                  opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice. It has been generally conceded\n                  that, barring exceptional circumstances such as two white candidates splitting\n                  the vote, a district should contain a black population of at least 65 percent or a\n                  black VAP [voting age population] of at least 60 percent to provide black voters\n                  with an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.\n\n490 F. Supp. at 575. Likewise, the Seventh Circuit used a minority population figure of sixty-five percent in a\nSection 2 case to identify when minorities are an “effective majority,” i.e., whether they have a “realistic opportunity\nto elect officials of their choice” in a district. Ketchum v. Byrne, 740 F.2d 1398, 1410-15 (7th Cir. 1984). Ketchum\nreached its figure by reasoning from a simple voting majority and augmenting it by five percent to account for low\nvoter registration among minority voters, five percent for low voter turnout, and five percent for youthful\npopulation. Id. at 1415. If Ketchum had started with voting-age population, it would not have added five percent for\nthe youthful portion of the minority population. Id.\n23\n   Texas asks this Court to set the percentage for a “safe” district at forty percent BVAP and fifty percent HCVAP.\nThis Court has already noted that, standing alone, these percentages are insufficient to establish the existence of an\nability district. Texas’ expert seems to agree. Dr. John Alford reports that Hispanic voters will have an ability to\nelect in a district in which the number of registered Hispanic voters exceeds fifty percent. U.S. Mem., Ex. 6 [Dkt. #\n79-8] at 4 (Report of Dr. John Alford). In contrast, Texas relied on (citizen) voting-age population statistics alone.\nTexas’ reliance on a forty percent BVAP and not a BVAP greater than fifty percent suggests that Texas also\nrecognizes the importance of factors beyond majority status in determining which districts will provide minority\nvoters the ability to elect.\n\n\n                                                          30\n\fForce’s Statement of Material Facts in Dispute [Dkt. # 78-1] at ¶ 257 (“Lower levels of\n\neducation, income, and earnings have the lingering effect of lowering Latino [electoral]\n\nparticipation rates, including registering and voting.”). The Supreme Court has also noted that\n\n“the political, social, and economic legacy of past discrimination for Latinos in Texas may well\n\nhinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process.” LULAC, 548 U.S. at 440\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Such a background requires a more\n\ncomplicated retrogression analysis than Texas wants this Court to approve, but it is part and\n\nparcel of discerning whether minority voters will be effective in their exercise of the electoral\n\nfranchise. Because the statutory watchword is “ability to elect,” data that pertains to actual\n\nminority citizen voting strength must be analyzed for each relevant district.\n\n                  In particular, minority voter registration and minority voter turnout can be\n\nimportant indicators of whether historical barriers to minorities’ ability to elect have been\n\neradicated.24 For example, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary found during the 2006\n\nreauthorization of the VRA that Latino voters nationwide turned out and voted at rates\n\nsignificantly lower than White voters. In addition, the Committee found that in Texas, while\n\n41.5 percent of Latinos were registered to vote, only approximately 29.3 percent turned out in the\n\n2004 election. See S. REP. NO. 109-295, at 11. Such findings underscore why Texas’ reliance\n\non a bare majority-minority district cannot be used to determine an ability district under Section\n\n5. Given its history, Texas cannot overlook education and employment levels affecting minority\n\nelectoral participation and remnants of historic discrimination that may continue to affect voting\n\nin some areas of the State. Minority voter registration and turnout, together with other evidence\n24\n   Texas provided some such data in its motion and reply brief, but made no arguments regarding its significance for\na retrogression inquiry. It continued to rely on population statistics to argue that its Plans do not have a retrogressive\neffect.\n\n\n\n                                                           31\n\fof election results and minority voting behavior, will supplement any court’s analysis of\n\npopulation trends when counting ability districts in the benchmark and proposed plans.\n\n                  Other factors are also relevant in the determination of whether past gains in\n\nminority citizens’ ability to elect will be diminished by “any” change in voting practices.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has never outlined all factors relevant to this inquiry, it has\n\nemphasized that retrogression analysis “is often complex in practice to determine.” Georgia v.\n\nAshcroft, 539 U.S. at 480. We conclude that the type of factors relevant to this complex inquiry\n\nmay include the number of registered minority voters in redrawn districts; population shifts\n\nbetween or among redrawn districts that diminish or enhance the ability of a significant,\n\norganized group of minority voters to elect their candidate of choice; an assessment of voter\n\nturnout in a proposed district; to the extent discernible, consideration of future election patterns\n\nwith respect to a minority preferred candidate; and new ability districts that would offset any lost\n\nability district.25\n\n                  Although Intervenors urge this Court to find retrogression when redistricting\n\ndismantles a voting district in which a minority group was on the cusp of achieving majority\n\nstatus, this Court will not consider this as a factor in our retrogression analysis. The argument\n\n25\n   Nonetheless, it may be that retrogression in a proposed plan is unavoidable. Population losses or shifts can\ndecrease minority voter participation. States and other political jurisdictions legitimately consider geographic (e.g.,\nmountains, water courses) and political (e.g., county lines, city lines) boundaries in drawing election districts. In\nsome circumstances, a non-retrogressive redistricting plan may not be possible given other legitimate constraints on\nelectoral maps. This Court agrees with the comment in the 2011 DOJ Guidance:\n\n                  There may be circumstances in which the jurisdiction asserts that, because of\n                  shifts in population or other significant changes since the last redistricting (e.g.,\n                  residential segregation and demographic distribution of the population within\n                  the jurisdiction, the physical geography of the jurisdiction, the jurisdiction’s\n                  historical redistricting practices, political boundaries, such as cities or counties,\n                  and/or state redistricting requirements), retrogression is unavoidable.\n\n76 Fed. Reg. 7470-01, at 7472.\n\n\n\n                                                          32\n\fthat the VRA protects predictable future gains in minority electoral power is directly at odds with\n\nSection 5’s purpose to protect against retrogressive effect. See Beer, 425 U.S. at 140 (Section 5\n\nwas enacted “to shift the advantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its\n\nvictim, by freezing election procedures in the covered areas unless the changes can be shown to\n\nbe nondiscriminatory.” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Redistricting can have\n\nno retrogressive effect on an ability to elect that has not yet been realized. City of Pleasant\n\nGrove v. United States, 479 U.S. 462 (1987), cited by TLBC, LULAC, and the Texas State\n\nConference of NAACP Branches, does not change this assessment. As discussed further below,\n\nPleasant Grove was a discriminatory purpose case. 479 U.S. at 471-72. The decision did not\n\naddress whether it would be retrogressive to suppress emerging voting strength in a redistricting\n\neffort. In line with Beer and the language of Section 5, this Court finds that evidence of\n\npreventing an emerging ability to elect from crystallizing will not support the contention that a\n\nplan has an impermissible retrogressive effect under Section 5.\n\n                  Finally, Texas argues that the United States’ analysis of retrogression, reflected in\n\nthe 2011 DOJ Guidance, is elusive and expensive. We disagree. Although our analysis is not\n\nidentical to the 2011 DOJ Guidance, it shares many factors. The 2011 Guidance is consistent\n\nwith the guidance DOJ has been issuing to assess retrogressive effect for the past two decades.26\n\n\n26\n   The relevant DOJ guidance memoranda are those issued in 2001 and 1987. In those policy statements, the DOJ\n(in different administrations and under different Attorneys General) listed factors exceedingly similar, if not\nidentical, to the ones that the DOJ currently asserts are relevant to a Section 5 retrogression analysis. Compare\nGuidance Concerning Redistricting and Retrogression Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S. § 1973c,\n66 Fed. Reg. 5412-01, at 5413 (Jan. 18, 2001) with 76 Fed. Reg. 7470-01, at 7471. In the 2001 Guidance\nMemorandum, the DOJ stated that it would begin its retrogression analysis by compiling all relevant census data;\nsuch data was “the important starting point” for administrative evaluation of benchmark and proposed plans. See 66\nFed. Reg. 5412-01, at 5413 (indicating that DOJ would review “additional demographic and election data” to assess\nthe “actual effect” of proposed changes on minority populations and explicitly mentioning, as it did in 2011, that it\nbelieved that “election history and voting patterns within the jurisdiction, voter registration and turnout information,\nand other similar information are very important” to a VRA retrogression analysis). A Notice issued by the DOJ in\n\n\n                                                          33\n\fCovered jurisdictions, including Texas, have been able to preclear voting plans under its various\n\niterations. 27 Thus, despite Texas’ arguments to the contrary, this Court is hard-pressed to find\n\nthat a multi-factored test — dependent on population analyses and other factors — is too new,\n\ntoo expensive, or too complex for covered jurisdictions to follow.\n\n                           2. Coalition Districts\n\n                  In counting ability districts, Texas ignored those in which coalitions of minority\n\nvoters and coalitions of minority and White voters formed to support the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate. But Section 5 requires such consideration in determining whether minorities have the\n\nability to elect preferred candidates. The statute states no preference for how the minority group\n\nis able to elect its preferred candidate, whether by cohesive voting by a single minority group or\n\nby coalitions made up of different groups.28 Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized the value\n\nof voting coalitions formed by minority voters:\n\n                  [T]here are communities in which minority citizens are able to\n                  form coalitions with voters from other racial and ethnic groups,\n                  having no need to be a majority within a single district in order to\n                  elect candidates of their choice . . . . [M]inority voters are not\n                  immune from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find\n                  common political ground.\n\n\n\n\n1987 was very similar. See Revision of Procedures for the Administration of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of\n1965, 52 Fed. Reg. 486-01 (Jan. 6, 1987). DOJ noted in 1987 that many covered jurisdictions, much like Texas\nbefore this Court, had urged it to adopt a retrogression standard that could be “applied to submitted changes in a\nfairly mechanical way,” but the DOJ declined to adopt such an approach because it would be unrealistic to shorten\n“[a] Section 5 determination [that] is . . . based on the appraisal of a complex set of facts that do not readily fit a\nprecise formula for resolving the preclearance issues.” Id. at 486.\n27\n  See Pl.’s Mem.[Dkt. # 41] at 3 (“[I]n 2003 the [Texas] Legislature decided to take up redistricting again and\nenacted a congressional redistricting plan. That plan was precleared by the Department of Justice . . . .”).\n28\n   The House Report on the 2006 Amendments clearly recognized that coalition districts can work to form an ability\ndistrict, see H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 46, and, while the Senate emphasized majority-minority districts, it did not\ndistinguish or discard minority coalition districts. See S. REP. NO. 109-295, at 17.\n\n\n\n                                                          34\n\fGeorgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 481 (quoting Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1020\n\n(1994)) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is simply a fact of political life that in certain\n\ndistricts, a single minority group may not have the ability to achieve desired electoral outcomes\n\nindependently, but could elect its preferred candidate if it formed either a crossover district by\n\n“attract[ing] sufficient crossover votes from white voters,” Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146,\n\n154 (1993), or a coalition district by partnering with another minority group.29\n\n                  Texas contends that the 2006 Amendments that overruled Georgia v. Ashcroft\n\nalso rejected the idea that coalition politics should be taken into account under Section 5. This\n\nargument has no support in the text of the Amendments themselves and misreads the legislative\n\nhistory. Congress only took issue with Georgia v. Ashcroft to the extent that it held that states\n\ncould trade “influence” districts for prior “ability” districts without issue under Section 5. See\n\nH.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 44 (“[T]he Supreme Court would allow the minority community’s\n\nown choice of preferred candidates to be trumped by political deals struck by State legislators\n\npurporting to give ‘influence’ to the minority community. . . . Permitting these trade-offs is\n\ninconsistent with the original and current purpose of Section 5.”). Congress never found that\n\ncoalition districts could not provide minority citizens with the ability to elect.30\n\n\n29\n   Dicta in Bartlett v. Strickland, a Section 2 case, differentiated between minority citizens’ “own choice” and the\nchoice made by a coalition. 129 S. Ct. at 1244; see also Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 154 (comparing crossover districts\nto “influence” districts). This Court clarifies that coalition districts for Section 5 purposes are those in which the\ncandidate voted into office by the coalition is the minority-preferred candidate, whether that candidate is a member\nof the minority or not. Identification of the minority preferred candidate is a factual question.\n30\n   In the Senate Report to the 2006 Amendments, Senator Jon Kyl wrote separately “to explain why [he] believe[s]\nthat Congress cannot require that state or local governments create or retain influence or coalition districts.” S. R EP.\nNO. 109-295, at 22 (Additional views of Senator Kyl). Senator Kyl’s individual views regarding the scope of\nprotection afforded to minorities under Section 5 do not change this Court’s analysis, or call into question the\nlegislative intent regarding the 2006 Amendments. First, the Senate Report carries little weight as a piece of\nlegislative history or evidence of legislative intent. As noted by Senator Patrick Leahy and others, the Senate Report\nwas filed a week after the Act had been passed by both houses of Congress. The Senate Report was not considered\nby Congress prior to a vote on the legislation, and Congress did not adopt or affirm its findings. Indeed, “post-\n\n\n                                                           35\n\f                  Texas also cites Bartlett v. Strickland to argue that the Supreme Court has rejected\n\nthe notion that a Section 5 analysis can take political coalitions into account, but Bartlett is not a\n\nSection 5 case and does not deal with coalition districts. See 129 S. Ct. at 1242-43 (stating that\n\nthe Court did not address “coalition-district claims in which two minority groups form a coalition\n\nto elect the candidate of the coalition’s choice”). Like Section 2 cases before it, a plurality of the\n\nCourt in Bartlett held that a compact minority group needs to have the potential (“opportunity”)\n\nto constitute a majority in a district for there to be a Section 2 violation. Id. at 1244 (“Only once,\n\nin dicta, has this Court framed the first Gingles requirement as anything other than a majority-\n\nminority rule.”). Thus, the Bartlett Court held that Section 2 does not require states to create\n\npotential crossover districts to ensure equal electoral opportunity for minority voters because\n\nnothing in Section 2 grants special protection to minority citizens’ “right[] to form political\n\ncoalitions.” Id. at 1243. Yet, freedom from an obligation to create a crossover district under\n\nSection 2 does not equate to freedom to ignore the reality of an existing crossover district in\n\nwhich minority citizens are able to elect their chosen candidates under Section 5.\n\n                  Since coalition and crossover districts provide minority groups the ability to elect\n\na preferred candidate, they must be recognized as ability districts in a Section 5 analysis of a\n\nbenchmark plan. Coalition and crossover districts that continue unchanged into a proposed plan\n\nmust be counted as well. Our recognition that crossover and coalition districts are ability\n\ndistricts in a benchmark plan is rooted in the fact that there must be discrete data, by way of\n\nelection returns, to confirm the existence of a voting coalition’s electoral power. For example,\n\n\npassage legislative history is a contradiction in terms. Any after-the-fact attempts to re-characterize the legislation’s\nlanguage and effects [cannot] be credited.” S. REP. NO. 109-225, at 55 (Additional views of Senators Leahy,\nKennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin). Second, as explained below, the statutory text\nand the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence regarding Section 5 make clear that crossover and minority coalition districts\nprovide minority citizens the ability to elect their candidates of choice.\n\n\n                                                           36\n\fevidence that a coalition had historical success in electing its candidates of choice would\n\ndemonstrate that the minority voters in that district had, and would continue to have, an ability to\n\nelect their preferred candidates. Proving the existence of a coalition district will require more\n\nexacting evidence than would be needed to prove the existence of a majority-minority district as\n\ndemonstrating past election performance is vital to showing the existence of an actual coalition\n\ndistrict.\n\n                  By contrast, a state creating a “new” crossover or coalition district simply\n\nanticipates, or hopes, that the minority population in the new district will align politically and\n\ncoalesce with other groups of voters to elect its candidates of choice. It would be extremely\n\ndifficult to confirm that minority voters would indeed have the ability to elect in the newly\n\nformed district.31 Since potential new crossover-coalition districts are “subject to [this] high\n\ndegree of speculation and prediction,” Bartlett, 129 S. Ct. at 1245, they can rarely be deemed\n\nability districts in a proposed plan.\n\n                           3. Retrogression in Proportional Versus Absolute Terms\n\n                  The Defendants argue that retrogression should be assessed on a plan-wide basis,\n\ncontending that a relative overall decrease in minority citizens’ share of electoral districts is\n\n31\n   Indeed, a state’s attempt to create future crossover districts may lead to the creation of “influence” districts that\nGeorgia v. Ashcroft approved and Congress rejected in the 2006 Amendments. In Georgia v. Ashcroft, the Court\napproved Georgia’s creation of new influence and coalition districts in proposed redistricting plans to offset the loss\nof majority-minority districts in the benchmark. 539 U.S. at 487. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that\nGeorgia had probably met its burden of demonstrating non-retrogression because its strategy of increasing Black\nvoting strength by “‘unpacking’ minority voters in some districts to create more influence and coalitional districts\n[was] apparent.” Id. As part of the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA, Congress rejected Georgia’s proposition that\ncreation of influence and coalition districts may be used to offset other losses of a minority population’s voting\npower, specifically amending Section 5 to “make[] clear that . . . the comparative ‘ability [of the minority\ncommunity] to elect preferred candidates of choice’ is the relevant factor to be evaluated when determining whether\na voting change has a retrogressive effect.” H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 46. The House Report to the 2006\nAmendments explained the “concern[] . . . that ‘[m]inority influence is nothing more than a guise for diluting\nminority voting strength’” and that “leaving the Georgia standard in place would encourage States to spread\nminority voters under the guise of ‘influence’ and would effectively shut minority voters out of the political\nprocess.” Id. at 45.\n\n\n                                                           37\n\fretrogressive. According to this argument, Texas’ failure to draw one or more additional\n\nHispanic ability districts in the Congressional Plan is retrogressive in the face of the Hispanic\n\npopulation growth in Texas that is in large measure responsible for the State’s four new\n\ncongressional seats. In support, they cite Georgia v. Ashcroft: “[I]n examining whether [a] new\n\nplan is retrogressive, the inquiry must encompass the entire statewide plan as a whole.” 539 U.S.\n\nat 479. But that language does not support the Defendants’ argument. It was speaking to a\n\nstate’s ability under Section 5 to offset the loss of an ability district in one area of a state by the\n\ngain of a new ability district elsewhere. Id.\n\n                 Texas relies on Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U.S. 74 (1997), which rejected the idea\n\nthat the addition of electoral districts necessarily requires the addition of minority ability\n\ndistricts. In Abrams, Georgia gained a single new congressional district because of a population\n\nincrease. This new district was not a minority ability district. The plaintiffs argued that the new\n\nplan was retrogressive because by failing to draw the new district as an ability district, the\n\npercentage of majority Black districts in the State decreased from ten percent to nine percent.\n\n521 U.S. at 97. The Supreme Court rejected the argument, stating that if it found retrogression\n\non such facts, “each time a State with a majority-minority district was allowed to add one new\n\ndistrict because of population growth, it would have to be majority-minority. This the Voting\n\nRights Act does not require.” Id. at 97-98.\n\n                 The United States distinguishes Abrams, relying on the substantial growth in\n\nTexas’ Hispanic population, Texas’ four new congressional seats (an unprecedented number for\n\nStates fully covered by Section 5),32 and the new provisions of the 2006 Amendments. It urges\n\n\n32\n  Notably, after the 1990 Census, Texas gained three additional congressional seats in response to which it created\ntwo new majority Black districts and a majority Hispanic district “with a view to complying with the Voting Rights\n\n\n                                                        38\n\fthis Court to limit Abrams to its facts, arguing that although a state need not add a new ability\n\ndistrict for each new district, under the facts of this case it was retrogressive for Texas not to add\n\nany new ability districts.\n\n                 This Court concludes that Abrams does not control. Although Abrams is clear\n\nthat the VRA does not require there to be a new minority ability district for every new\n\ncongressional seat, it does not hold that a state’s failure to draw new minority districts can never\n\nbe retrogressive. Nevertheless, this Court concludes that Texas’ failure to draw new Hispanic\n\nability districts to match the growth of its Hispanic population was not retrogressive. Section 5\n\nis limited to preventing “[s]tates from undoing or defeating the rights recently won” by\n\nminorities, Beer, 425 U.S. at 140 (quoting H.R. REP. NO. 91-397, at 8) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); it does not require states to add additional protections, id. (quoting H.R. REP. NO. 94-\n\n196, at 57-58) (internal quotation marks omitted), or to create new minority districts in\n\nproportion to increases in the minority group’s population. Id. at 137 n.8 (“This Court has, of\n\ncourse, rejected the proposition that members of a minority group have a federal right to be\n\nrepresented in legislative bodies in proportion to their number in the general population.”). Here,\n\nwhere Texas’ percentage gain in congressional seats (12.5%) is similar to Georgia’s percentage\n\ngain in Abrams (10%), we see no need to require of Texas what the Supreme Court did not\n\nrequire of Georgia.\n\n                 Although Texas’ alleged failure to account for the significant increase of the\n\nHispanic population in the State does not establish retrogression, it is relevant to the Court’s\n\nevaluation of whether the Congressional Plan was enacted with discriminatory purpose. A\n\n\nAct.” See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 957. All three districts, however, were found to be the product of an\nunconstitutional racial gerrymander. Id. at 979-86.\n\n\n\n                                                        39\n\fredistricting plan that does not increase a minority group’s voting power, despite a significant\n\ngrowth in that minority group’s population, may provide significant circumstantial evidence that\n\nthe plan was enacted with the purpose of denying or abridging that community’s right to vote.33\n\nCf. City of Pleasant Grove, 479 U.S. at 471 (“Section 5 looks not only to the present effects of\n\nchanges, but to their future effects as well . . . . Likewise, an impermissible purpose under § 5\n\nmay relate to anticipated as well as present circumstances.”).34 The Defendants are therefore\n\nincorrect as to the form, but not necessarily as to the substance of their argument. A state’s\n\nfailure to account for a minority group’s population growth that results in additional electoral\n\nseats, while not conclusive of an unlawful retrogressive effect under Section 5, may be\n\nnonetheless highly relevant and probative to the purpose inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n33\n  Based upon its identification of minority ability districts, the United States contends that nearly half a million\nHispanics would lose their ability to elect in the proposed Congressional Plan.\n34\n   In City of Pleasant Grove, an “all-white enclave in an otherwise racially mixed area of Alabama,” sought\npreclearance for the annexation of two parcels of land, one vacant and another containing a few white residents. 479\nU.S. at 465. The three-judge district court declined to grant preclearance, concluding that the jurisdiction had failed\nto demonstrate that the annexations did not have the purpose of abridging the minority population’s right to vote.\nThe Supreme Court affirmed the three-judge court, concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support the\nallegation that the city was annexing non-Black areas but refusing to annex Black areas. Despite the fact that there\nwere “no black voters in Pleasant Grove” and the annexations therefore could not have an effect on Black voting in\nthe city, the Court explained:\n\n                  [A]n impermissible purpose under § 5 may relate to anticipated as well as\n                  present circumstances . . . . Common sense teaches that appellant cannot\n                  indefinitely stave off the influx of black residents and voters . . . . One means of\n                  thwarting this process is to provide for the growth of a monolithic white voting\n                  block, thereby effectively diluting the black vote in advance. This is just as\n                  impermissible a purpose as the dilution of present black voting strength. To\n                  hold otherwise would make appellant's extraordinary success in resisting\n                  integration thus far a shield for further resistance. Nothing could be further from\n                  the purposes of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nId. at 471-72 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                           40\n\f                   C. Discriminatory Purpose\n\n                   Summary judgment is also not appropriate because Texas has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the Plans do not have the purpose of “denying or abridging the right to vote on\n\naccount of race or color, or [membership in a language minority group].” Texas argues that its\n\nlegislators had no animus towards any racial or language minority group but acted from purely\n\npartisan motives in drawing its redistricting Plans. Texas further argues that significant\n\nfederalism concerns would be raised if a federal court were to examine the actions of its State\n\nlegislature.35 The United States responds that a discriminatory purpose that violates Section 5\n\ndoes not always require an intent to target a minority group but can include a plan enacted in a\n\ndiscriminatory manner, even if designed to achieve a permissible aim.36 The Intervenors present\n\n35\n   Texas does not challenge the constitutionality of Section 5, see Complaint [Dkt. # 1], but relies on the\nConstitution as a shield. Texas argues that the 2006 Amendments only forbid states from making those changes that\nwould themselves violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and the Fifteenth\nAmendment’s guarantee that the right to vote shall not be “denied or abridged by the United States or by any State\non account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” U.S. CONST. amend XIV, § 2; id. amend. XV, § 1. A\nsimple comparison of Section 5 and these Reconstruction-era Amendments shows that they do not track and Texas’\ncontention cannot be accepted wholesale. The Fifteenth Amendment does not protect language-minority voters and\nthe Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to a language minority qua language minority. See Soberal-Perez v.\nHeckler, 717 F.2d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 1983) (“Language, by itself, does not identify members of a suspect class.”); but\nsee Olagues v. Russoniello, 797 F.2d 1511, 1521 (9th Cir. 1986) (distinguishing Soberal-Perez v. Heckler and\nstating that a non-English speaking classification is facially neutral but is, for all practical purposes, a classification\nbased on race and national origin and therefore suspect), vacated as moot, 484 U.S. 806 (1987). Thus, while both\nAmendments are relevant to the legitimacy of a redistricting plan as to other minorities, they are not determinative\nand provide only guidance as to language minorities, such as Hispanics.\n36\n  The United States cites Judge Kozinski’s opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in Garza v. County of\nLos Angeles, 918 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. 1990), for this proposition:\n\n                   Assume you are an anglo [sic] homeowner who lives in an all-white\n                   neighborhood. Suppose, also, that you harbor no ill feelings toward minorities.\n                   Suppose further, however, that some of your neighbors persuade you that having\n                   an integrated neighborhood would lower property values and that you stand to\n                   lose a lot of money on your home. On the basis of that belief, you join a pact not\n                   to sell your house to minorities. Have you engaged in intentional racial and\n                   ethnic discrimination? Of course you have. Your personal feelings toward\n                   minorities don’t matter; what matters is that you intentionally took actions\n                   calculated to keep them out of your neighborhood.\n\n918 F.2d at 778 n.1.\n\n\n\n                                                            41\n\fsome evidence supporting their claims of discriminatory purpose, but also suggest that further\n\ndiscovery is needed. At oral argument, Texas contended that, even if taken as true, the evidence\n\npresented by the United States and Intervenors is insufficient to prove discriminatory intent.\n\n                  We conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the\n\nPlans were enacted with discriminatory intent. As discussed earlier, the 2006 Amendments\n\nmake illegal any changes to voting qualifications, requirements, standards, practices, or\n\nprocedures that are adopted or pursued in order to deny or abridge the right to vote “on account\n\nof” a particular characteristic protected by the statute. 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a)-(c). As the\n\nSupreme Court reminds us in Arlington Heights, “Determining whether invidious discriminatory\n\npurpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct\n\nevidence of intent as may be available.” 429 U.S. at 266; see also Cromartie, 526 U.S. at 546\n\n(“The task of assessing a jurisdiction’s motivation, however, is not a simple matter; on the\n\ncontrary, it is an inherently complex endeavor . . . .”). Such an intensely fact-driven inquiry is\n\ntypically difficult to resolve at the summary judgment stage.\n\n                  The United States asserts that there is ample circumstantial evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory purpose with regard to the State House and Congressional Plans that raises a\n\ngenuine dispute of material facts. Likewise, the Intervenors challenge the Plans overall, their\n\ngeneral impact on Hispanic voters,37 the rushed sequence of events that preceded their adoption,\n\nprocedural and substantive departures from past practice, and treatment of specific districts and\n\ncommunities within each Plan.\n\n37\n   For example, there are allegedly no new Hispanic ability districts in the Congressional Plan, despite Hispanics’\nsubstantial population growth in Texas. The Gonzales Intervenors allege, however, that although Whites now\nconstitute 45.3 percent of the State’s population, Whites are a majority of the voting-age population in twenty-five\nout of thirty-six congressional districts, an increase from twenty-two in the benchmark.\n\n\n\n                                                         42\n\f                  Texas only countered arguments from the United States and those Intervenors that\n\nchallenge the State Senate Plan. In its brief and at oral argument, Texas offered three responses\n\nto Defendants’ claims of discriminatory purpose: 1) the State’s obligation to its own\n\nConstitution, which specifically bans unnecessarily dividing counties to form voting districts, see\n\nTEX. CONST. art. III, § 26; 2) political logic: Hispanics are Democrats, Democrats are the party\n\nout of power in the State, and, therefore, it is politics not illegal animus that accounts for any\n\nalleged circumstantial evidence of discriminatory purpose38; and 3) affidavit testimony by Texas\n\nlegislators and their staff that no discriminatory purpose was espoused by any member of the\n\nTexas Legislature, any staff, or anyone else when offering redistricting proposals. Yet Texas has\n\nnot disputed many of the Intervenors’ specific allegations of discriminatory intent. This Court\n\nconcludes that the United States and Intervenors have provided sufficient evidence to preclude\n\nsummary judgment and to require further review of the claims of discriminatory purpose directed\n\nto all three Plans.\n\n                                               IV. CONCLUSION\n\n                  Section 5 requires a multi-factored, functional approach to gauge whether a\n\nredistricting plan will have the effect of denying or abridging minority citizens’ ability to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice. It does not lend itself to formalistic inquiry and complexity is\n\ninherent in the statute. The ability to elect can rarely be measured by a simple statistical\n\nyardstick, as is the essence of Texas’ approach. Defendants also challenge all three Plans as\n\ndiscriminatory in purpose, but genuine disputes of material fact preclude summary judgment on\n\n\n\n\n38\n   But see Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 968 (“[T]o the extent that race is used as a proxy for political characteristics, a\nracial stereotyping requiring strict scrutiny is in operation.”).\n\n\n\n                                                           43\n\fthis record.

As\n\nrequired by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, Texas has asked this Court for a declaratory\n\njudgment that its redistricting plans have neither the purpose nor the effect of denying or\n\nabridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority\n\ngroup. The United States contends that the proposed congressional and State House districts\n\fadversely affect the voting rights of Hispanics. Various Intervenors assert the same claim as the\n\nUnited States, but some of them target the plans for the State Senate as well.\n\n                  On November 8, 2011, this Court denied summary judgment to Texas because: 1)\n\nTexas used an improper standard and/or methodology to determine which districts afford\n\nminority voters the ability to elect their candidates of choice; and 2) material facts remain in\n\ndispute regarding whether the plans in fact comply with Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nOrder [Dkt # 106]. This Opinion provides our analysis.\n\n                                                     I. FACTS\n\n                  A. Procedural Background\n\n                  On July 19, 2011, Texas filed the instant complaint for declaratory judgment that\n\nredistricting plans1 it adopted to govern elections for the U.S. House of Representatives\n\n(“Congressional Plan”), the State House of Representatives (“State House Plan”), the State\n\nSenate (“State Senate Plan”) (collectively the “Plans”), and the State Board of Education\n\ncomplied with Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973c. The United States and\n\nseveral of the Intervenors2 (collectively with the United States, the “Defendants”) filed answers\n\nchallenging the Congressional Plan, the State House Plan, and the State Senate Plan. No one\n\n\n\n1\n  Redistricting is a process by which national, state, and local voting districts are redrawn, normally after each\nnational census because of population changes over the intervening decade.\n2\n   This Court has granted seven parties status as Defendant-Intervenors. Each Intervenor contests various aspects of\none to three of the plans in their capacity as individual voters, state elected representatives, or civil rights advocacy\ngroups. The Davis Intervenors are Texas State Senators and representatives from districts in the Fort Worth area.\nThe Mexican American Legislative Caucus is a caucus group in the Texas House of Representatives. The Gonzales\nIntervenors are a group of Hispanic and Black voters residing in Texas. The Texas Legislative Black Caucus is\ncomposed of seventeen members of the Texas House of Representatives. The Texas Latino Redistricting Task Force\nis a group of Hispanic organizations focusing on redistricting and voter registration. The Texas State Conference of\nNAACP Branches and the League of United Latin American Citizens are civil rights and advocacy groups\nconcerned with minority voting rights in Texas.\n\n\n\n                                                            2\n\fchallenges the redistricting plans for the State Board of Education.3 Texas moved for summary\n\njudgment on September 14, 2011. The parties engaged in swift discovery, filed briefs and\n\nexhibits, and presented oral argument to this Court on November 2, 2011.\n\n                  A three-judge court in the Western District of Texas is currently hearing\n\nconstitutional challenges and challenges under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to these same\n\nredistricting Plans. Mindful of the fact that our refusal to grant preclearance would require that\n\ncourt to draw interim plans because of election-related deadlines in Texas, this Court issued an\n\norder denying summary judgment on all three Plans on November 8, 2011. See Dkt. # 106; see\n\nalso Perez v. Texas, No. 5:11-360, Am. Order [Dkt. # 391] (W. D. Tex. Oct. 4, 2011)\n\n(consolidated action); Davis v. Perry, No. 5:11-788, Am. Order [Dkt. # 15] (W. D. Tex. Oct. 4,\n\n2011). The Court now issues its Memorandum Opinion explaining its reasoning.\n\n                  B. Statutory Background\n\n                  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (“VRA”), Pub. L. No. 89-110, 79 Stat. 437\n\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1973 et seq.), was enacted to counteract attempts by states\n\nand local jurisdictions to evade the Reconstruction Amendments’ prohibitions on racial\n\ndiscrimination in voting.4 Litigation and court orders had been slow and often ineffective in\n\n3\n  The Texas State Board of Education (“BOE”) is composed of fifteen single-member districts. Texas claimed that\nthe benchmark plan for the BOE contained three Hispanic “opportunity” districts, with a Hispanic Citizen Voting\nAge Population (“HCVAP”) of greater than fifty percent, and two Black “opportunity” districts, with a Black Voting\nAge Population (“BVAP”) of greater than thirty percent. In the proposed BOE plan, Texas states that there are also\nthree Hispanic “opportunity” districts that have an HCVAP of greater than fifty percent, and two Black\n“opportunity” districts with BVAPs of greater than thirty percent. This Court provided the parties another\nopportunity to object to preclearance of the proposed BOE plan during a teleconference held on September 21, 2011.\nAfter no party voiced opposition, this Court entered declaratory judgment in favor of Texas on that plan on\nSeptember 22, 2011. See Minute Entry Order (Sept. 22, 2011). Consequently, the BOE plan is not in contention\nhere.\n4\n  The VRA was extended in 1975 to cover members of language minority groups, such as Hispanics. Through\nreference to 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(f)(2) in both subsections (a) and (b), Section 5 extends its protection to language\nminority groups:\n\n\n\n                                                          3\n\fcurbing the egregious abuses that jurisdictions had used to impede minority voters in the exercise\n\nof their constitutionally protected rights.

The VRA contains a set of “sterner and more elaborate measures” that Congress found\n\nnecessary to fight the “insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetrated in certain parts of\n\nour country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.” Id. at 309.\n\n                 The VRA contains a complex remedial scheme “aimed at areas where voting\n\ndiscrimination has been most flagrant.” Id. at 315. These targeted, temporary remedial measures\n\napply to a state or local political body that is a “covered” jurisdiction as defined by Section 4(b)\n\nof the VRA, i.e., one that has been found, according to a statutory formula, to have engaged in\n\nvoting discrimination.

It was enacted as “a response to a\n\ncommon practice in some jurisdictions of staying one step ahead of the federal courts by passing\n\nnew discriminatory voting laws as the old ones had been struck down.” Beer v.

Section 5\n\nplaces the burden of proof on the covered jurisdiction to show that the planned change “neither\n\nhas the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of\n\n\n\n            No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure\n            shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge\n            the right of any citizen of the United States to vote because he is a member of a\n            language minority group.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1976b(f)(2).\n\n\n\n                                                        4\n\frace or color, or [membership in a language minority group].” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a).

In particular, this lawsuit focuses on the Plans’ effect on Hispanic and Black\n\nvoters in Texas and whether these Plans were enacted with a discriminatory purpose aimed at\n\nsuch voters. For the purposes of the VRA, Hispanic citizens are treated as members of a\n\nlanguage minority group.

Beer, 425 U.S. at 139-40. By enacting\n\nSection 5, Congress aimed to guarantee that minorities’ new gains in political participation\n\nwould not be undone. Id. at 140-41. Thus, the Supreme Court has found that the “purpose of\n\n[Section] 5 has always been to insure that no voting-procedure changes would be made that\n\nwould lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective\n\nexercise of the electoral franchise.” Id. at 141 (emphasis added); see 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(d)\n\n(“The purpose of [§ 1973(b)] is to protect the ability of such [minority] citizens to elect their\n\npreferred candidates of choice.”).\n\n               Determining whether a new voting plan diminishes the ability to elect and thus\n\nhas a retrogressive effect on minority voting rights necessarily requires a comparison between\n\nthe voting plan in place and the proposed plan. Bossier I, 520 U.S. at 478. A covered\n\njurisdiction’s existing plan serves as the “benchmark” against which the “‘effect’ of voting\n\nchanges is measured.” Id. The Supreme Court has instructed that Section 5 is not ameliorative\n\nand the focus of its retrogression analysis is on “freezing election procedures in the covered areas\n\nunless the changes can be shown to be nondiscriminatory.” Beer, 425 U.S. at 140 (quoting H.R.\n\nREP.

[it] so\n\ndiscriminates on the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution”).\n\n               Beer described Section 5 as requiring covered jurisdictions to protect minority\n\ngroups’ “effective exercise of the electoral franchise,” which meant the “ability of minority\n\ngroups to participate in the political process and to elect their candidate of choice.” 425 U.S. at\n\n141 (emphasis added). Although the Supreme Court used this phrase in subsequent decisions, it\n\nwas not until Georgia v. Ashcroft that the Court provided further explanation of its reasoning.\n\nGeorgia v. Ashcroft placed greater emphasis on minority participation in electoral politics,\n\nholding that a “court should not focus solely on the comparative ability of a minority group to\n\nelect a candidate of its choice” but should look to the “totality of the circumstances” regarding\n\nvoter participation, including “the extent of the minority group’s opportunity to participate in the\n\npolitical process.” 539 U.S. at 479-80 (emphasis added). Using this analysis, the Court stated\n\nthat Section 5 accommodates choices by covered jurisdictions among systems of representation\n\nwhen redistricting, i.e., a jurisdiction may create “safe” majority-minority districts that may\n\n“virtually guarantee the election of a minority group’s preferred candidate”; it may create\n\ndistricts where a coalition of voters “will help to achieve the electoral aspirations of the minority\n\ngroup”; or it may add “influence districts,” where minorities play a “substantial, if not decisive,\n\nrole in the electoral process.” Id. at 480-83. The Supreme Court concluded that the lower\n\ncourt’s retrogression analysis had focused too much on decreases in the Black population in\n\nmajority-minority districts and had not properly credited increases in coalition and influence\n\ndistricts under Georgia’s proposed redistricting plan, which could offset potential losses in\n\nmajority-minority districts. Id. at 486-87.\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f               Congress disagreed with this analysis and amended Section 5 in response to\n\nGeorgia v.

The 2006 Amendments clarified that Congress\n\nintended a Section 5 inquiry to focus on whether a proposed voting change will diminish the\n\n“ability [of minority citizens] to elect preferred candidates of choice.” H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at\n\n46 (emphasis added). Thus, Congress specified that any change that has the effect of\n\ndiminishing citizens’ ability to elect a candidate of their choice on account of race, color, or\n\nmembership in a language minority group “denies or abridges the right to vote” within the\n\nmeaning of Section 5. 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b); H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 46.\n\n               By these Amendments, Congress sought to make clear that it was not enough that\n\na redistricting plan gave minority voters “influence”; a plan cannot diminish their ability to elect\n\ncandidates. The House Report opined that leaving the Georgia v. Ashcroft standard in place\n\nwould encourage states to disperse minority voters into different voting districts under an\n\n“influence” label and that gains made by minority voters in districts where they were represented\n\nby the candidate of their choice would be jeopardized. H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 45.\n\n                       2. “Purpose” Analysis\n\n               Section 5 also prohibits covered jurisdictions from implementing a plan that is\n\nenacted with the “purpose” of “denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color,\n\nor [membership in a language minority].” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c. In Bossier II, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that a plan animated by a discriminatory purpose could nonetheless merit preclearance if its\n\npurpose was something other than to diminish a minority group’s ability to elect their preferred\n\ncandidates. The government conceded that the plan proffered by the covered jurisdiction did not\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fhave a retrogressive effect on the voting ability of the minority population. 528 U.S. at 324. The\n\ngovernment argued that the Court should nonetheless deny preclearance because facts\n\ndemonstrated that the plan was enacted with discriminatory intent. Id. at 328. In a 5-4 decision,\n\nthe Supreme Court concluded that “the ‘purpose’ prong of § 5 covers only retrogressive\n\ndilution.” Id. In other words, Section 5 only prohibited plans that were enacted with the purpose\n\nto reduce minorities’ ability to elect — whether or not retrogression actually occurred. Section 5\n\ndid not, however, “prohibit preclearance of a redistricting plan enacted with a discriminatory but\n\nnon-retrogressive purpose.” Id. at 341.\n\n               In the 2006 Amendments, Congress clarified that the “purpose” requirement of\n\nSection 5 prohibits not only voting plans enacted with a retrogressive purpose, but also plans\n\ndevised with “any discriminatory purpose.” 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(c). The House Report\n\ncharacterized Bossier II as a severe limitation on the reach of the “purpose” prong, through\n\nwhich “Congress [had] sought to prevent covered jurisdictions from enacting and enforcing\n\nvoting changes made with a clear racial animus, regardless of the measurable impact of such\n\ndiscriminatory changes.” H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 42. According to the House Report,\n\nCongress intended to restore the pre-Bossier II discriminatory purpose standard:\n\n               Voting changes that “purposefully” keep minority groups “in their\n               place” have no role in our electoral process and are precisely the\n               types of changes Section 5 is intended to bar. To allow otherwise\n               would be contrary to the protections afforded by the 14th and 15th\n               [A]mendment[s] and the VRA. Thus, by clarifying that any voting\n               change motivated by any discriminatory purpose is prohibited\n               under Section 5, the Committee seeks to ensure that the “purpose”\n               prong remains a vital element to ensuring that Section 5 remains\n               effective.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fId. at 43.

Indeed, Bossier I instructed\n\nlower courts conducting a Section 5 analysis to “look to . . . Arlington Heights for guidance,”\n\nwhere the Court had “set forth a framework for analyzing ‘whether invidious discriminatory\n\npurpose was a motivating factor’ in a government body’s decisionmaking.” 520 U.S. at 488\n\n(quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266). The legislative history to the 2006 Amendments\n\nand reauthorization of the VRA demonstrate congressional agreement with that approach.\n\n               Arlington Heights was not a Voting Rights Act case. It involved the refusal of the\n\nVillage of Arlington Heights, Illinois, to re-zone a tract of land for low-income housing, which\n\nwas challenged as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In\n\nreaching its decision in favor of the Village, the Supreme Court identified multiple factors to\n\nassess whether the Village’s purpose was discriminatory. 429 U.S. at 267-68. The Court\n\ncautioned that “[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor\n\ndemands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be\n\navailable.” Id. at 266; see also Hunt v.

Parties’ Arguments Regarding the Legal Standard to Measure\n                     Retrogressive Effect\n\n                  Texas and the Defendants contest the standard for measuring whether a proposed\n\nredistricting plan would have a retrogressive effect on minority voters’ ability to elect their\n\ncandidates of choice. Texas relies on voting population demographics alone. In both its\n\nbenchmark and proposed plans, Texas counted as ability districts, which it calls “opportunity\n\ndistricts,” 7 those districts in which Blacks make up forty percent of the voting-age population\n\nand Hispanics make up fifty percent of the citizen voting-age population. Texas omitted\n7\n   Texas’ use of “opportunity district” connotes a measure of uncertainty that is not supported by the language of the\nVRA. “Opportunity” denotes conditions that are “favorable” to such an outcome. See WEBSTER’S INTERNATIONAL\nNEW DICTIONARY 1583 (3d ed. 2002) (defining “opportunity” as “a combination of circumstances, time, and place\nsuitable or favorable for a particular activity or action” (emphasis added)). The statutory standard is whether\nminorities have an “ability to elect” a preferred candidate. An “ability” denotes the “the physical, mental, or legal\npower to perform,” id. at 3, a concept that requires a greater degree of certainty that an event can occur. Thus, in\nline with the language of Section 5, this Court references “ability districts” as districts that afford minority voters the\nelectoral power protected under Section 5. This term is used both for districts that have afforded minority voters the\nability to elect their preferred candidate in the past and those that predictively will do so in the future.\n\n\n\n                                                            12\n\fconsideration of all other factors. The United States, joined by all Intervenors, argues for a\n\nmulti-factored “functional” analysis, which starts with an examination of voting-age population\n\nbut also analyzes additional factors. See Guidance Concerning Redistricting Under Section 5 of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 7470 (Feb. 9, 2011).\n\n               Texas contends that the 2006 Amendments to Section 5 provide that covered\n\njurisdictions need only maintain those districts where minority voters can control the election\n\nand posits that majority-minority districts are best suited to accomplish this goal. Texas relied on\n\nvoting-age population statistics to ensure that its proposed redistricting Plans were not\n\nretrogressive. Texas explains that each of its Plans maintains at least the same number of\n\ndistricts as in the benchmark plans in which a specified minority constitutes a percentage of\n\neligible voters sufficient to determine the outcome of elections. Texas sets this percentage at\n\nmore than fifty percent of the citizen voting-age population for Hispanics (“HCVAP”) and forty\n\npercent of the voting-age population for Blacks (“BVAP”) in the State. Texas “defines ‘ability\n\nto elect’ districts based upon . . . demographic data indicating [that] a [single] cohesive racial or\n\nethnic group has the ability to elect candidates of their choice — whether or not the candidate\n\nreceives support from other voters in the district.” Pl.’s Reply [Dkt. # 92] at 27. Thus, Texas’\n\narguments that its Plans have no retrogressive effect are solely based upon data measuring\n\nminority voting-age population.\n\n               Defendants challenge this logic and its results. All Defendants ask this Court to\n\nconclude, consistent with the guidance issued by the DOJ in 2011 (“2011 DOJ Guidance”), that\n\nthere is no single measure that determines minorities’ ability to elect:\n\n               In determining whether the ability to elect exists in the benchmark\n               plan and whether it continues in the proposed plan, the Attorney\n               General does not rely on any predetermined or fixed demographic\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f                   percentages at any point in the assessment.” See [2011 DOJ\n                   Guidance]. Determining whether the ability to elect exists\n                   “requires a functional analysis of the electoral behavior within the\n                   particular jurisdiction or election district.” Id. Besides population,\n                   this includes an examination of election history and voting patterns\n                   within the jurisdiction, voter registration and turnout information.8\n\nU.S. Mem. [Dkt. # 79] at 6; see Intervenors’ Joint Mem. [Dkt # 74] at 7.\n\n                   Although the United States relies on the multi-factored 2011 DOJ Guidance, the\n\ntest it offered to measure retrogression, while more comprehensive than Texas’ approach, still\n\nrelied upon a limited set of data. Using data compiled by the State, the United States’ expert, Dr.\n\nLisa Handley, performed a functional election analysis in which she assessed data on statewide\n\nelections and elections within specific voting districts in order to identify which districts afford\n\nminority voters the ability to elect. She then recompiled data on certain statewide elections\n\nbased upon the proposed new boundaries of voting districts and determined how often minority-\n\npreferred candidates would succeed in the redrawn districts. The United States used this data to\n\nassert that minority groups’ ability to elect would be lost in certain proposed congressional and\n\nState House districts.\n\n                   The Intervenors also take issue with Texas’ view that all districts where Hispanic\n\nvoters constitute a majority of the citizen voting-age population or Black voters constitute forty\n\n8\n    The 2011 DOJ Guidance indicates that the DOJ also assesses:\n\n                   whether minority concentrations are fragmented among different districts;\n                   whether minorities are overconcentrated in one or more districts; whether\n                   alternative plans satisfying the jurisdiction’s legitimate governmental interests\n                   exist, and whether they were considered; whether the proposed plan departs\n                   from objective redistricting criteria set by the submitting jurisdiction, ignores\n                   other relevant factors such as compactness and contiguity, or displays a\n                   configuration that inexplicably disregards available natural or artificial\n                   boundaries; and, whether the plan is inconsistent with the jurisdiction’s stated\n                   redistricting standards.\n\n76 Fed. Reg. 7470-01, at 7472.\n\n\n\n                                                          14\n\fpercent of the voting-age population are ipso facto “ability to elect” districts. They advocate for\n\na multi-factored approach that accounts for:\n\n                      the size of a district’s minority population considering citizenship rates;\n\n                      voting-age population and voter registration;\n\n                      the extent of racially polarized voting;\n\n                      the presence of electoral coalitions involving minority voters;\n\n                      the role of incumbency in past elections;\n\n                      factors that affect turnout rates by race; and\n\n                      recent electoral trends.\n\nIntevenors’ Joint Mem. at 6-7.\n\n               All Defendants contend that Section 5 protections are not limited to districts\n\nwhere a single minority group has the ability to elect its candidate of choice, but extend to\n\ndistricts where one group of minority voters joins together with voters of a different racial or\n\nlanguage background to elect the minority voters’ candidate of choice. The United States points\n\nto language in the House Report accompanying the 2006 Amendments explaining that Section 5\n\nprotects minorities’ ability to elect candidates of choice either “directly or coalesced with other\n\nvoters.” U.S. Mem. at 14 (quoting H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 46). Defendants urge this Court to\n\nconclude that the proposed Plans are retrogressive because they do not account for the loss of\n\ncoalition districts, while Texas contends that such districts are not protected under the VRA.\n\n               Defendants also argue that where, as in Texas, a proposed plan contains an\n\nincreased number of voting districts, the percentage of minority ability districts in the proposed\n\nplan should be measured against the percentage of minority ability districts in the benchmark\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fplan. Defendants ask this Court to find that the Congressional Plan is retrogressive because it\n\nincreases the number of electoral districts (in significant part because of the increase in the\n\nHispanic population in Texas), but allegedly does not increase the number of ability districts for\n\nHispanic voters.\n\n                 Finally, the Intervenors, most specifically the Texas Legislative Black Caucus\n\n(“TLBC”), the League of United Latin American Citizens (“LULAC”), and the Texas State\n\nConference of NAACP Branches, assert that Section 5 not only protects against the\n\ndiminishment of an existing ability to elect, but also the diminishment of an emerging ability to\n\nelect. These Intervenors contend that Section 5’s retrogression standard must include an\n\nassessment of whether redistricting forestalls emerging minority electoral opportunities in\n\nbenchmark districts. They argue that, because a retrogression analysis under Section 5 in some\n\nmeasure looks to the future effect of changes in voting practices, it must protect against the\n\nreduction of predictable future gains in minority voting strength.\n\n                 D. Parties’ Arguments Regarding the Contested Plans\n\n                 Applying their own respective retrogression analyses, the parties dispute the\n\nalleged retrogressive effect that Texas’ proposed restricting Plans will have on minority voters’\n\nability to elect their candidates of choice. The parties’ comparison of the benchmark plans, i.e.,\n\nthe most recent electoral plans in effect for the U.S. House of Representatives, Texas State\n\nSenate, and Texas House of Representatives,9 with Texas’ proposed redistricting Plans leads\n\n\n9\n  Texas identified the following benchmark plans. For the U.S. House of Representatives, the State identified plan\nC100, which was implemented in 2006 by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in LULAC v.\nPerry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. 716 (E.D. Tex. 2006). For the Texas House of Representatives, it identified plan H100,\nwhich was implemented in 2001 by the same district court in Balderas v. Texas, No. 01-158, Final Judgment [Dkt #\n458] (E.D. Tex. Nov. 28, 2001). For the Texas State Senate, it identified plan S100, which was implemented in\n2001 after it received preclearance from the DOJ.\n\n\n\n                                                        16\n\fthem to dispute which districts should be counted as minority ability districts in both the\n\nbenchmark and proposed Plans.10\n\n                           1. The Congressional Plan\n\n                  In its analysis of the benchmark congressional districts, Texas identified, out of a\n\ntotal of thirty-two districts, seven Hispanic ability districts, each of which allegedly has an\n\nHCVAP of more than fifty percent.11 Texas concedes that under the proposed Congressional\n\nPlan, Congressional District (“CD”) 27 would no longer be an ability district for Hispanics.\n\nTexas counters that this loss is more than offset by two new Hispanic ability districts:\n\napproximately 71.7 percent of the citizen voting age population of CD 34 will be Hispanic; 51.9\n\npercent of CD 35 will be as well. As a result, Texas asserts that its proposed Congressional Plan\n\nwill add one Hispanic ability district, increasing the number of Hispanic ability districts from\n\nseven to eight. The proposed Congressional Plan will thus, according to Texas, ameliorate rather\n\nthan retrogress Hispanic voting power in the State.\n\n                  Texas also asserts that Black voting power in the State will be enhanced under the\n\nCongressional Plan. Currently, only CD 18 has a BVAP of more than forty percent. With the\n\nnew plan, CD 30 will also.12\n\n                  The United States agrees that the proposed Congressional Plan does not retrogress\n\nBlack voting power, and appears to credit Texas with three (not just two) Black ability\n\n10\n   For example, Texas identified eight minority ability districts in the benchmark congressional plan while the\nUnited States identified ten. Likewise, Texas identified forty-three minority ability districts in the benchmark plan\nfor the Texas House while the United States identified fifty.\n11\n  Texas identified Congressional Districts 15, 16, 20, 23, 27, 28, and 29 as Hispanic ability districts in the\nbenchmark.\n12\n   Without explaining its relevance, Texas also points out that CD 9, which has a more than thirty percent but less\nthan forty percent BVAP, will maintain that percentage under the proposed plan.\n\n\n\n                                                          17\n\fcongressional districts in the Congressional Plan. According to the United States, CDs 9, 18, and\n\n30 are, and will remain, Black ability districts in both the benchmark and the proposed plan. The\n\nUnited States argues, however, that Hispanic voting power will retrogress under the proposed\n\nCongressional Plan because: 1) Texas’ Congressional Plan does not create any new Hispanic\n\nability districts, despite a significant increase in the Hispanic population and four new\n\ncongressional districts in the State; and 2) CD 23, which Texas counts as a Hispanic ability\n\ndistrict under the benchmark, would not be an ability district in the proposed plan.\n\n               Both the United States and Texas agree that the proposed Congressional Plan\n\nwould include at least seven Hispanic ability districts (CDs 15, 16, 20, 28, 29, 34, and 35) and\n\nthat CD 27, which was a Hispanic ability district under the benchmark, would lose this status.\n\nThe parties dispute the status of CD 23 under the proposed plan. Although both agree that CD\n\n23 is a Hispanic ability district under the benchmark, they disagree as to its status under the\n\nproposed plan. Texas asserts that CD 23 will continue to be a Hispanic ability district in the\n\nproposed plan because it will have an HCVAP of 58.5 percent. The United States argues that\n\nCD 23’s new boundaries, which will allegedly include Hispanics with lower voter turnout, will\n\nactually decrease Hispanic voter participation and diminish their ability to elect. However, the\n\nUnited States agrees that the alleged addition of CDs 34 and 35 as Hispanic ability districts in the\n\nproposed Congressional Plan would provide Texas with seven total Hispanic ability districts\n\nunder the proposed plan.\n\n               The Gonzales Intervenors argue that CD 25 should be counted in the benchmark\n\nas a minority ability district and that the proposed Congressional Plan has a retrogressive effect\n\non this district. They argue, with no opposition from Texas, that Hispanic, Black, and fifty\n\npercent of White voters in CD 25 have voted cohesively in support of minority preferred\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fcandidates. But CD 25 will lose large numbers of minority voters in the proposed plan, and\n\nthese voters will be replaced by an influx of White voters whose voting behavior differs\n\nsubstantially from the Whites who voted with minorities in the benchmark.\n\n                  Finally, the United States and several Intervenors assert that the proposed\n\nCongressional Plan is retrogressive because it fails to recognize adequately the significance of\n\nthe Hispanic contribution to Texas’ population growth in the last decade. According to the 2010\n\nCensus, the population of the State has grown by over four million people since 2000, of which\n\napproximately two-thirds are Hispanics. This population surge has resulted in a gain of four\n\nseats in the U.S. House of Representatives, increasing the number of Texas delegates from thirty-\n\ntwo to thirty-six, an increase unprecedented for a state fully covered by Section 5. U.S. Mem. at\n\n22 n.9. Despite the historic increase in the number of congressional seats, these Defendants\n\nargue that Texas drafted a redistricting plan that creates no new Hispanic ability districts. They\n\nargue that this is sufficient evidence that the proposed Congressional Plan is retrogressive,\n\nbecause maintaining at seven the number of Hispanic ability districts in the face of this surge in\n\nHispanic population would reduce the proportion of Hispanic ability districts in Texas’\n\ncongressional delegation.13 Texas responds that a redistricting plan that preserves the pre-\n\nexisting number of minority ability districts will always satisfy Section 5’s retrogression\n\nstandard.\n\n\n\n\n13\n   The United States and the Latino Redistricting Task Force Intervenors calculate that Hispanic voters have the\nability to elect preferred candidates in 21.9 percent of the benchmark districts but only in 19.4 percent of the districts\nin the Congressional Plan.\n\n\n\n                                                           19\n\f                           2. The Texas House of Representatives Plan\n\n                  In the benchmark plan for the Texas House of Representatives, Texas identifies\n\nthirty districts out of a total of 150 that have an HCVAP of more than fifty percent, which, by\n\nTexas’ measure, afford Hispanic citizens the ability to elect their candidates of choice.14\n\nAccording to Texas, the proposed State House Plan will also have thirty districts that have an\n\nHCVAP of more than fifty percent, allegedly maintaining the same number of Hispanic ability\n\ndistricts as in the benchmark. Texas concedes that State House District (“HD”) 33, which is\n\ncurrently a Hispanic ability district under the benchmark plan, will no longer be such a district in\n\nthe proposed State House Plan. Texas claims, however, that “new” HD 148 will offset that loss.\n\nWith regard to the Black minority population, Texas identifies eleven districts in the benchmark\n\nplan that have a BVAP of more than forty percent, and twelve districts with the same BVAP of\n\nmore than forty percent in the proposed State House Plan. The proposed plan adds HD 27 as a\n\nnew Black ability district. Based on these population statistics, Texas contends that its proposed\n\nState House Plan will not have a retrogressive effect on the ability of Hispanic or Black voters to\n\nelect their candidates of choice to the Texas House of Representatives.\n\n                  The United States and several Intervenors, however, disagree. Notably, the\n\nUnited States does not believe the proposed State House Plan would retrogress Black voting\n\npower.15 However, according to the United States and several Intervenors, the State House Plan\n\nwould retrogress Hispanic voting power. Based on its retrogression analysis, the United States\n\n\n14\n   The thirty Hispanic ability districts that Texas identifies in the House benchmark plan are districts 31, 33-43, 74-\n80, 104, 116, 117-119, 123-125, 140, 143, and 145.\n15\n  The United States identifies twelve Black ability districts under the benchmark plan, 22, 95, 100, 109-111, 131,\n139, 141, 142, 146, and 147. It identifies HD 27 as a new Black ability district in the proposed State House Plan,\nwhich brings its count of such districts to thirteen under the proposed plan.\n\n\n\n                                                          20\n\fidentifies thirty-four Hispanic ability districts under the benchmark plan, of which three or four\n\nwill allegedly be lost in the proposed State House Plan.16\n\n                  Additionally, Dr. Handley opines that of four “coalition districts” in the\n\nbenchmark, where minorities have been able to elect their candidates of choice by uniting with\n\nother minority groups, two — HD 149 and HD 27 — will be lost. In HD 149, a coalition of\n\nHispanic, Black, and Asian voters has repeatedly elected its candidate of choice since 2004, but\n\nthat ability would be lost under the proposed State House Plan. Although Dr. Handley also\n\nidentified HD 27 as a coalition district in the benchmark, she noted that it would change to a\n\nBlack ability district under the proposed plan. Due to alleged fracturing in these districts, the\n\nUnited States anticipates a loss of four to five minority ability districts, i.e., HDs 33, 35, 41, 117,\n\nand 149, in the State House Plan.\n\n                  As noted, most Intervenors agree with the United States. In addition, Intervenors\n\nTLBC, LULAC, and the Texas State Conference of NAACP Branches argue that, under the State\n\nHouse Plan, minority voting power would be diminished in HDs 26, 101, 106, and 144, each of\n\nwhich was on the verge of becoming a minority ability district under the benchmark.\n\n                           3. The Texas State Senate Plan\n\n                  Out of a total of thirty-one State Senate districts, Texas identifies seven Hispanic\n\nability districts under the benchmark plan in which there is an HCVAP of greater than fifty\n\n\n\n\n16\n   The United States asserts that Hispanic voters would lose the ability to elect their candidate of choice in HDs 33,\n35, and 117 due to the reconfiguration of the Hispanic population in each district and racially polarized voting.\nAdditionally, the government states that Hispanic voters may also lose their ability to elect in HD 41. The\ngovernment’s expert was “unable to make a determination” regarding this district. U.S. Mem., Ex. 4 [Dkt. # 79-6]\nat 1 n.1 (Handley House Report). Texas argues that HDs 35, 41, and 117 will remain majority-minority, although\nthere will be a decrease in HCVAP in HDs 35 and 41.\n\n\n                                                          21\n\fpercent,17 and claims the same number based on the same districts in the proposed State Senate\n\nPlan. Additionally, Texas identifies two Black ability districts with a BVAP of more than forty\n\npercent under the benchmark plan, each of which remains such in the proposed State Senate\n\nPlan.18 The United States has similarly concluded that the proposed State Senate Plan is not\n\nretrogressive.\n\n                    However, the Davis Intervenors allege that the State Senate Plan is retrogressive\n\nbecause it fractures Black and Hispanic communities that have formed a working coalition to\n\nelect their candidate of choice in Senate District (“SD”) 10.19 This is not a district deemed by\n\nTexas or the United States to be a minority ability district in the benchmark plan. However, the\n\nIntervenors claim both that it was an ability district in the benchmark and that, due to alleged\n\nfracturing of SD 10’s minority communities in the proposed State Senate Plan, minority voters in\n\nthis district will no longer be able to elect their candidate of choice. Texas “refutes any argument\n\nthat [SD] 10 was ‘dismantled’” and further states that SD 10 “in both the benchmark plan and\n\n[the proposed plan] is a crossover district, and not even a particularly strong one. Such districts\n\nare not protected under the VRA.” Texas Reply to Senate [Dkt. # 90] at 5.\n\n                    Another group of Intervenors — TLBC, LULAC, and the Texas State Conference\n\nof NAACP Branches — argues that the proposed State Senate Plan will retrogress minority\n\nvoters’ ability to elect in SD 15. These Intervenors allege that the combined Black and Hispanic\n\n17\n   The Hispanic ability districts that Texas identifies in the State Senate benchmark plan are districts 6, 19-21, 26,\n27, and 29.\n18\n     The Black ability districts that Texas identifies in the State Senate benchmark plan are districts 13 and 23.\n19\n   The Davis Intervenors provide a statement from County Commissioner Roy Brooks that Black and Hispanic\nleaders “deliberately and aggressively recruited Wendy Davis to run in 2008 . . . . To elect our candidate of choice,\nBlacks and Hispanics had to come together and vote together, which we did.” Davis Statement of Facts [Dkt. # 76-\n2] at ¶ 4. The Davis Intervenors allege that Senator Davis was elected with ninety-nine percent of the Hispanic and\nBlack vote and that she only received thirty percent of the White vote. Id. at ¶ 6.\n\n\n                                                            22\n\fpercentage of total population in proposed SD 15 decreases from 72.3 percent to 66.7 percent\n\nand that such a decrease will be electorally significant. Texas argues in response that “[SD] 15\n\nwas not a protected district under the benchmark because it was not a majority-minority\n\ndistrict.”20 Texas Reply to Senate at 4. According to Texas, “In both the benchmark and [the\n\nproposed plan], [SD] 15 is a coalition district” and “such districts are not protected.” Id.\n\n                          II.

ANALYSIS\n\n                A. Summary Judgment is Inappropriate Because Texas Used an Incorrect\n                   Standard to Measure Retrogression\n\n                Texas urges this Court to rely solely on voter demographic data to identify\n\nmajority-minority districts and to count only such districts as minority ability districts. This\n\nCourt cannot oblige. We find that a simple voting-age population analysis cannot accurately\n\nmeasure minorities’ ability to elect and, therefore, that Texas misjudged which districts offer its\n\nminority citizens the ability to elect their preferred candidates in both its benchmark and\n\nproposed Plans. Since Texas used the wrong standard, there are material facts in dispute about\n\nwhich districts are minority ability districts in the benchmark and proposed Plans. On this\n\nrecord, we cannot determine whether the Plans will have a retrogressive effect on Texas’\n\nminority citizens’ ability to elect.\n\n                Beginning with Beer, the Supreme Court has addressed the relationship between\n\nmajority-minority districts and a minority group’s ability to elect, but has never suggested that\n\nthe inquiry required by Section 5 can be satisfied by examining only the number of majority-\n\nminority districts. In fact, the Court has acknowledged that the inquiry is a complex undertaking.\n\nSee Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 480 (“The ability of minority voters to elect a candidate of\n\ntheir choice is important but often complex in practice to determine.”); see also Holder v. Hall,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117874\"><a href=\"/opinion/117874/holder-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 883-84 (1994) (plurality opinion) (“[T]here may be difficulty in determining\n\nwhether a proposed change would cause retrogression . . . .”).

See, e.g., League of United Latin\n\nAm. Citizens v. Perry (LULAC), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145627\"><a href=\"/opinion/145627/league-of-united-latin-american-citizens-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 428 (2006) (observing that “it may be possible for\n\na citizen voting-age majority to lack real electoral opportunity”). Texas has been able to provide\n\nno authority to support its reliance on a single-factor test, and we decline to depart from the clear\n\nguidance of the Supreme Court’s Section 5 precedent that assessing retrogression is a\n\nmultifaceted, fact-specific inquiry.\n\n                In rejecting Texas’ standard, this Court starts with the 2006 Amendments to\n\nSection 5. The fundamental question is whether any change proposed by Texas “will have the\n\neffect of diminishing the ability” of minorities “to elect” their preferred candidates. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973c(b). Should there be any doubt, Congress emphasized that the “purpose” of § 1973c(b) is\n\n“to protect the ability” of minority citizens “to elect their preferred candidates.” Id. § 1973c(d).\n\nClearly, “ability to elect” is the statutory watchword.\n\n                In making its Amendments, Congress sought to restore the “ability to elect”\n\nstandard promulgated by the Supreme Court in Beer. H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 45-46 (“[A]\n\nchange should be denied preclearance under Section 5 if it diminishes the ability of minority\n\ngroups to elect their candidates of choice. Such was the standard of analysis articulated by the\n\nSupreme Court in Beer v. United States . . . .”); see Beer, 425 U.S. at 141 (stating that the Section\n\n5 standard “can only be fully satisfied by determining . . . whether the ability of minority groups\n\nto participate in the political process and to elect their choices to office is . . . affected”). The\n\nHouse of Representatives identified significant benefits to minority communities under the Beer\n\nstandard. H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 45-46. In addition, the House Report specifically\n\ncommented that “[v]oting changes that leave a minority group less able to elect a preferred\n\n\n                                                   25\n\fcandidate of choice, either directly or when coalesced with other voters, cannot be precleared\n\nunder Section 5.” Id. at 46 (emphasis added).\n\n               Thus, “being able” or “having the power” to elect — in the past (the benchmark)\n\nand the future (a proposed redistricting plan) — is what matters under Section 5. This Court\n\nconcludes that a review of redistricting plans under Section 5 must be concerned with the\n\nfunctioning of the electorate, i.e., whether minority voters will be “effective [in their] exercise of\n\nthe electoral franchise.” Beer, 425 U.S. at 141.\n\n               Texas perceives “ability” and “opportunity” as interchangeable, but they represent\n\ndifferent concepts that serve different purposes. In its motion, Texas identifies minority\n\n“opportunity districts” as significant under Section 5. An “opportunity” to elect is meaningful\n\nunder Section 2 of the VRA, but not necessarily under Section 5.\n\n               Section 2 is violated upon a showing that minorities “have less opportunity than\n\nother members of the electorate to . . . elect representatives of their choice.” 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1973(b). Section 2 “was designed as a means of eradicating voting practices that minimize or\n\ncancel out the voting strength and political effectiveness of minority groups”; thus, it “bars all\n\nStates and their political subdivisions from maintaining” any voting practice that, inter alia,\n\ndilutes the votes of minority citizens. Bossier I, 520 U.S. at 479 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted). A plaintiff claiming vote dilution under Section 2 must satisfy the three\n\n“Gingles factors:” 1) the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to\n\nconstitute a majority in a single member district; 2) the group is politically cohesive; and 3) there\n\nis sufficient bloc voting by the White majority to defeat the minority preferred candidate.

See Bossier I, 520 U.S. at 480 (“Because the very concept of\n\nvote dilution implies – and, indeed, necessitates – the existence of an ‘undiluted’ practice against\n\nwhich the fact of dilution may be measured, a § 2 plaintiff must also postulate a reasonable\n\nalternative voting practice to serve as the benchmark ‘undiluted’ voting practice.”). Without\n\nsuch a showing, there can be neither wrong nor remedy. Bartlett, 129 S. Ct. at 1243 (citing\n\nGrowe v. Emison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112818\"><a href=\"/opinion/112818/growe-v-emison/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1993)).\n\n                 Under Section 2, demographic data is necessarily geared towards identifying\n\nminority voters’ “opportunity” to elect. Thus, because Texas equates “opportunity” and “ability”\n\ndistricts, it relies on data analysis pertinent to Section 2 to sustain its analysis of retrogressive\n\neffect under Section 5. However, population demographics alone will not fully reveal whether\n\nminority citizens’ ability to elect is or will be present in a voting district. Demographics alone\n\ncannot identify all districts where the effective exercise of the electoral franchise by minority\n\ncitizens is present or may be diminished under a proposed plan within the meaning of Section\n\n5.21 See, e.g., LULAC, 548 U.S. at 428.\n\n                 The question of retrogressive effect under Section 5 looks at gains that have\n\nalready been realized by minority voters and protects them from future loss. A Section 5 claim\n\nrequires a determination of how and where minority citizens’ ability to elect is currently present\n\nin a covered jurisdiction and how it will manifest itself in a proposed plan. This requires\n21\n   Section 2 challenges are most often concerned with vote dilution claims. This Court uses case law from Section\n2 in this Section 5 analysis only as it speaks to circumstances that adversely impact minority citizens’ ability to\nelect.\n\n\n\n                                                        27\n\fidentifying districts in which minority citizens enjoy an existing ability to elect and comparing\n\nthe number of such districts in the benchmark to the number of such districts in a proposed plan\n\nto measure the proposed plan’s effect on minority citizens’ voting ability. See Bossier I, 520\n\nU.S. at 478 (“Retrogression, by definition, requires a comparison of a jurisdiction’s new voting\n\nplan with its existing plan.”). Determining where and how the ability to elect is present is a\n\ncareful inquiry. This Court finds that the simple voting-age population statistics used by Texas\n\nare insufficient, and we cannot be confident that Texas has properly identified existing ability\n\ndistricts in its benchmark or future ability districts under the proposed Plans. Therefore, this\n\nCourt can neither count the former nor compare them to the latter. There are no easy shortcuts in\n\nthis inquiry. In particular, language minority status or race does not constitute a simple proxy for\n\npartisan preference in gauging the ability to elect. See, e.g., Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 968 (“[T]o\n\nthe extent that race is used as a proxy for political characteristics, a racial stereotyping requiring\n\nstrict scrutiny is in operation.”).\n\n                B. The Correct Legal Standard Governing Retrogression Analysis\n\n                        1. Ability-to-Elect Factors\n\n                If population statistics alone are insufficient to determine the existence and\n\nlocation of ability districts, what factors are relevant to an inquiry into retrogressive effect under\n\nSection 5? Below we outline the types of factors that are relevant for this analysis. Our list of\n\nfactors is not exhaustive. It merely highlights the kinds of factors missing from the standard\n\nTexas used to seek preclearance.\n\n                At the outset, a court addressing a proposed voting plan under Section 5 must\n\ndetermine whether there is cohesive voting among minorities and whether minority/White\n\npolarization is present in the jurisdiction submitting the plan. See, e.g., Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539\n\n\n                                                  28\n\fU.S. at 485 (“[I]t is of course true that evidence of racial polarization is one of many factors\n\nrelevant in assessing whether a minority group is able to elect a candidate of choice . . . .”).\n\nPolarized voting occurs when minority and White communities cast ballots along racial or\n\nlanguage minority lines, voting in blocs. See H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 20. Polarized voting\n\nbetween minorities and Whites often renders minority voters powerless to elect their candidate of\n\nchoice because White voters will not cross over to elect a minority-preferred candidate. Id.\n\nFurthermore, polarized voting often signals that minority communities in fact prefer different\n\ncandidates than the majority and helps to identify districts in which minority voters are effective\n\nin electing their candidates of choice.\n\n                  Next, this Court agrees with all parties that population statistics are significant\n\nand an important starting point for a retrogression analysis. Drawing a district with a “safe”\n\nminority population can essentially guarantee electoral success for minority voters, regardless of\n\nchallenges posed by racially polarized voting. See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 480-81\n\n(noting that “majority-minority districts may virtually guarantee the election of a minority\n\ngroup’s preferred candidates in those districts”). Even when voting is polarized, a minority\n\ngroup that constitutes a supermajority in a district will likely have the ability to elect its chosen\n\ncandidate. A district with a minority voting majority of sixty-five percent (or more) essentially\n\nguarantees that, despite changes in voter turnout, registration, and other factors that affect\n\nparticipation at the polls, a cohesive minority group will be able to elect its candidate of choice.22\n\n\n22\n   The Supreme Court found a figure of sixty-five percent of total population to be reasonable to achieve a majority\nof eligible minority voters in a district.

However, when there is no supermajority in a district, a Section\n\n5 analysis must go beyond mere population data to include factors such as minority voter\n\nregistration, minority voter turnout, election history, and minority/majority voting behaviors.23\n\n                  Determining that minorities have an ability to elect based solely on their numbers\n\nin the voting population of a district cannot account for the most fundamental concern of Section\n\n5: the effect past discrimination has on current electoral power. 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(b); see Riley,\n\n553 U.S. at 412 (noting that a jurisdiction is covered under Section 5 if among other things, “on\n\none of three specified coverage dates . . . it maintained a literacy requirement or other ‘test or\n\ndevice’ as a prerequisite to voting”). As the Intervenors note, historical discrimination against\n\nHispanics in Texas has, in some areas of the State, continued to depress their educational and\n\neconomic conditions such that the mere attainment of citizen voting-age status might have no\n\nreal effect on their ability to elect representatives of choice. See Latino Redistricting Task\n\n                  majority of black eligible voters in order to provide black voters with an\n                  opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice. It has been generally conceded\n                  that, barring exceptional circumstances such as two white candidates splitting\n                  the vote, a district should contain a black population of at least 65 percent or a\n                  black VAP [voting age population] of at least 60 percent to provide black voters\n                  with an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.\n\n490 F. Supp. at 575. Likewise, the Seventh Circuit used a minority population figure of sixty-five percent in a\nSection 2 case to identify when minorities are an “effective majority,” i.e., whether they have a “realistic opportunity\nto elect officials of their choice” in a district. Ketchum v. Byrne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439966\"><a href=\"/opinion/439966/mars-ketchum-v-jane-m-byrne/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1410-15 (7th Cir. 1984). Ketchum\nreached its figure by reasoning from a simple voting majority and augmenting it by five percent to account for low\nvoter registration among minority voters, five percent for low voter turnout, and five percent for youthful\npopulation. Id. at 1415. If Ketchum had started with voting-age population, it would not have added five percent for\nthe youthful portion of the minority population. Id.\n23\n   Texas asks this Court to set the percentage for a “safe” district at forty percent BVAP and fifty percent HCVAP.\nThis Court has already noted that, standing alone, these percentages are insufficient to establish the existence of an\nability district. Texas’ expert seems to agree. Dr. John Alford reports that Hispanic voters will have an ability to\nelect in a district in which the number of registered Hispanic voters exceeds fifty percent. U.S. Mem., Ex. 6 [Dkt. #\n79-8] at 4 (Report of Dr. John Alford). In contrast, Texas relied on (citizen) voting-age population statistics alone.\nTexas’ reliance on a forty percent BVAP and not a BVAP greater than fifty percent suggests that Texas also\nrecognizes the importance of factors beyond majority status in determining which districts will provide minority\nvoters the ability to elect.\n\n\n                                                          30\n\fForce’s Statement of Material Facts in Dispute [Dkt. # 78-1] at ¶ 257 (“Lower levels of\n\neducation, income, and earnings have the lingering effect of lowering Latino [electoral]\n\nparticipation rates, including registering and voting.”). The Supreme Court has also noted that\n\n“the political, social, and economic legacy of past discrimination for Latinos in Texas may well\n\nhinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process.” LULAC, 548 U.S. at 440\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Such a background requires a more\n\ncomplicated retrogression analysis than Texas wants this Court to approve, but it is part and\n\nparcel of discerning whether minority voters will be effective in their exercise of the electoral\n\nfranchise. Because the statutory watchword is “ability to elect,” data that pertains to actual\n\nminority citizen voting strength must be analyzed for each relevant district.\n\n                  In particular, minority voter registration and minority voter turnout can be\n\nimportant indicators of whether historical barriers to minorities’ ability to elect have been\n\neradicated.24 For example, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary found during the 2006\n\nreauthorization of the VRA that Latino voters nationwide turned out and voted at rates\n\nsignificantly lower than White voters. In addition, the Committee found that in Texas, while\n\n41.5 percent of Latinos were registered to vote, only approximately 29.3 percent turned out in the\n\n2004 election. See S. REP. NO. 109-295, at 11. Such findings underscore why Texas’ reliance\n\non a bare majority-minority district cannot be used to determine an ability district under Section\n\n5. Given its history, Texas cannot overlook education and employment levels affecting minority\n\nelectoral participation and remnants of historic discrimination that may continue to affect voting\n\nin some areas of the State. Minority voter registration and turnout, together with other evidence\n24\n   Texas provided some such data in its motion and reply brief, but made no arguments regarding its significance for\na retrogression inquiry. It continued to rely on population statistics to argue that its Plans do not have a retrogressive\neffect.\n\n\n\n                                                           31\n\fof election results and minority voting behavior, will supplement any court’s analysis of\n\npopulation trends when counting ability districts in the benchmark and proposed plans.\n\n                  Other factors are also relevant in the determination of whether past gains in\n\nminority citizens’ ability to elect will be diminished by “any” change in voting practices.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has never outlined all factors relevant to this inquiry, it has\n\nemphasized that retrogression analysis “is often complex in practice to determine.” Georgia v.\n\nAshcroft, 539 U.S. at 480. We conclude that the type of factors relevant to this complex inquiry\n\nmay include the number of registered minority voters in redrawn districts; population shifts\n\nbetween or among redrawn districts that diminish or enhance the ability of a significant,\n\norganized group of minority voters to elect their candidate of choice; an assessment of voter\n\nturnout in a proposed district; to the extent discernible, consideration of future election patterns\n\nwith respect to a minority preferred candidate; and new ability districts that would offset any lost\n\nability district.25\n\n                  Although Intervenors urge this Court to find retrogression when redistricting\n\ndismantles a voting district in which a minority group was on the cusp of achieving majority\n\nstatus, this Court will not consider this as a factor in our retrogression analysis. The argument\n\n25\n   Nonetheless, it may be that retrogression in a proposed plan is unavoidable. Population losses or shifts can\ndecrease minority voter participation. States and other political jurisdictions legitimately consider geographic (e.g.,\nmountains, water courses) and political (e.g., county lines, city lines) boundaries in drawing election districts. In\nsome circumstances, a non-retrogressive redistricting plan may not be possible given other legitimate constraints on\nelectoral maps. This Court agrees with the comment in the 2011 DOJ Guidance:\n\n                  There may be circumstances in which the jurisdiction asserts that, because of\n                  shifts in population or other significant changes since the last redistricting (e.g.,\n                  residential segregation and demographic distribution of the population within\n                  the jurisdiction, the physical geography of the jurisdiction, the jurisdiction’s\n                  historical redistricting practices, political boundaries, such as cities or counties,\n                  and/or state redistricting requirements), retrogression is unavoidable.\n\n76 Fed. Reg. 7470-01, at 7472.\n\n\n\n                                                          32\n\fthat the VRA protects predictable future gains in minority electoral power is directly at odds with\n\nSection 5’s purpose to protect against retrogressive effect. See Beer, 425 U.S. at 140 (Section 5\n\nwas enacted “to shift the advantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its\n\nvictim, by freezing election procedures in the covered areas unless the changes can be shown to\n\nbe nondiscriminatory.” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Redistricting can have\n\nno retrogressive effect on an ability to elect that has not yet been realized. City of Pleasant\n\nGrove v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111793\"><a href=\"/opinion/111793/pleasant-grove-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), cited by TLBC, LULAC, and the Texas State\n\nConference of NAACP Branches, does not change this assessment. As discussed further below,\n\nPleasant Grove was a discriminatory purpose case. 479 U.S. at 471-72. The decision did not\n\naddress whether it would be retrogressive to suppress emerging voting strength in a redistricting\n\neffort. In line with Beer and the language of Section 5, this Court finds that evidence of\n\npreventing an emerging ability to elect from crystallizing will not support the contention that a\n\nplan has an impermissible retrogressive effect under Section 5.\n\n                  Finally, Texas argues that the United States’ analysis of retrogression, reflected in\n\nthe 2011 DOJ Guidance, is elusive and expensive. We disagree. Although our analysis is not\n\nidentical to the 2011 DOJ Guidance, it shares many factors. The 2011 Guidance is consistent\n\nwith the guidance DOJ has been issuing to assess retrogressive effect for the past two decades.26\n\n\n26\n   The relevant DOJ guidance memoranda are those issued in 2001 and 1987. In those policy statements, the DOJ\n(in different administrations and under different Attorneys General) listed factors exceedingly similar, if not\nidentical, to the ones that the DOJ currently asserts are relevant to a Section 5 retrogression analysis. Compare\nGuidance Concerning Redistricting and Retrogression Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S. § 1973c,\n66 Fed. Reg. 5412-01, at 5413 (Jan. 18, 2001) with 76 Fed. Reg. 7470-01, at 7471. In the 2001 Guidance\nMemorandum, the DOJ stated that it would begin its retrogression analysis by compiling all relevant census data;\nsuch data was “the important starting point” for administrative evaluation of benchmark and proposed plans. See 66\nFed. Reg. 5412-01, at 5413 (indicating that DOJ would review “additional demographic and election data” to assess\nthe “actual effect” of proposed changes on minority populations and explicitly mentioning, as it did in 2011, that it\nbelieved that “election history and voting patterns within the jurisdiction, voter registration and turnout information,\nand other similar information are very important” to a VRA retrogression analysis). A Notice issued by the DOJ in\n\n\n                                                          33\n\fCovered jurisdictions, including Texas, have been able to preclear voting plans under its various\n\niterations. 27 Thus, despite Texas’ arguments to the contrary, this Court is hard-pressed to find\n\nthat a multi-factored test — dependent on population analyses and other factors — is too new,\n\ntoo expensive, or too complex for covered jurisdictions to follow.\n\n                           2. Coalition Districts\n\n                  In counting ability districts, Texas ignored those in which coalitions of minority\n\nvoters and coalitions of minority and White voters formed to support the minority-preferred\n\ncandidate. But Section 5 requires such consideration in determining whether minorities have the\n\nability to elect preferred candidates. The statute states no preference for how the minority group\n\nis able to elect its preferred candidate, whether by cohesive voting by a single minority group or\n\nby coalitions made up of different groups.28 Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized the value\n\nof voting coalitions formed by minority voters:\n\n                  [T]here are communities in which minority citizens are able to\n                  form coalitions with voters from other racial and ethnic groups,\n                  having no need to be a majority within a single district in order to\n                  elect candidates of their choice . . . . [M]inority voters are not\n                  immune from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find\n                  common political ground.\n\n\n\n\n1987 was very similar. See Revision of Procedures for the Administration of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of\n1965, 52 Fed. Reg. 486-01 (Jan. 6, 1987). DOJ noted in 1987 that many covered jurisdictions, much like Texas\nbefore this Court, had urged it to adopt a retrogression standard that could be “applied to submitted changes in a\nfairly mechanical way,” but the DOJ declined to adopt such an approach because it would be unrealistic to shorten\n“[a] Section 5 determination [that] is . . . based on the appraisal of a complex set of facts that do not readily fit a\nprecise formula for resolving the preclearance issues.” Id. at 486.\n27\n  See Pl.’s Mem.[Dkt. # 41] at 3 (“[I]n 2003 the [Texas] Legislature decided to take up redistricting again and\nenacted a congressional redistricting plan. That plan was precleared by the Department of Justice . . . .”).\n28\n   The House Report on the 2006 Amendments clearly recognized that coalition districts can work to form an ability\ndistrict, see H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 46, and, while the Senate emphasized majority-minority districts, it did not\ndistinguish or discard minority coalition districts. See S. REP. NO. 109-295, at 17.\n\n\n\n                                                          34\n\fGeorgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 481 (quoting Johnson v.

It is simply a fact of political life that in certain\n\ndistricts, a single minority group may not have the ability to achieve desired electoral outcomes\n\nindependently, but could elect its preferred candidate if it formed either a crossover district by\n\n“attract[ing] sufficient crossover votes from white voters,” Voinovich v. Quilter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112824\"><a href=\"/opinion/112824/voinovich-v-quilter/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n154 (1993), or a coalition district by partnering with another minority group.29\n\n                  Texas contends that the 2006 Amendments that overruled Georgia v. Ashcroft\n\nalso rejected the idea that coalition politics should be taken into account under Section 5. This\n\nargument has no support in the text of the Amendments themselves and misreads the legislative\n\nhistory. Congress only took issue with Georgia v. Ashcroft to the extent that it held that states\n\ncould trade “influence” districts for prior “ability” districts without issue under Section 5. See\n\nH.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 44 (“[T]he Supreme Court would allow the minority community’s\n\nown choice of preferred candidates to be trumped by political deals struck by State legislators\n\npurporting to give ‘influence’ to the minority community. . . . Permitting these trade-offs is\n\ninconsistent with the original and current purpose of Section 5.”). Congress never found that\n\ncoalition districts could not provide minority citizens with the ability to elect.30\n\n\n29\n   Dicta in Bartlett v. Strickland, a Section 2 case, differentiated between minority citizens’ “own choice” and the\nchoice made by a coalition. 129 S. Ct. at 1244; see also Voinovich, 507 U.S. at 154 (comparing crossover districts\nto “influence” districts). This Court clarifies that coalition districts for Section 5 purposes are those in which the\ncandidate voted into office by the coalition is the minority-preferred candidate, whether that candidate is a member\nof the minority or not. Identification of the minority preferred candidate is a factual question.\n30\n   In the Senate Report to the 2006 Amendments, Senator Jon Kyl wrote separately “to explain why [he] believe[s]\nthat Congress cannot require that state or local governments create or retain influence or coalition districts.” S. R EP.\nNO. 109-295, at 22 (Additional views of Senator Kyl). Senator Kyl’s individual views regarding the scope of\nprotection afforded to minorities under Section 5 do not change this Court’s analysis, or call into question the\nlegislative intent regarding the 2006 Amendments. First, the Senate Report carries little weight as a piece of\nlegislative history or evidence of legislative intent. As noted by Senator Patrick Leahy and others, the Senate Report\nwas filed a week after the Act had been passed by both houses of Congress. The Senate Report was not considered\nby Congress prior to a vote on the legislation, and Congress did not adopt or affirm its findings. Indeed, “post-\n\n\n                                                           35\n\f                  Texas also cites Bartlett v. Strickland to argue that the Supreme Court has rejected\n\nthe notion that a Section 5 analysis can take political coalitions into account, but Bartlett is not a\n\nSection 5 case and does not deal with coalition districts. See 129 S. Ct. at 1242-43 (stating that\n\nthe Court did not address “coalition-district claims in which two minority groups form a coalition\n\nto elect the candidate of the coalition’s choice”). Like Section 2 cases before it, a plurality of the\n\nCourt in Bartlett held that a compact minority group needs to have the potential (“opportunity”)\n\nto constitute a majority in a district for there to be a Section 2 violation. Id. at 1244 (“Only once,\n\nin dicta, has this Court framed the first Gingles requirement as anything other than a majority-\n\nminority rule.”). Thus, the Bartlett Court held that Section 2 does not require states to create\n\npotential crossover districts to ensure equal electoral opportunity for minority voters because\n\nnothing in Section 2 grants special protection to minority citizens’ “right[] to form political\n\ncoalitions.” Id. at 1243. Yet, freedom from an obligation to create a crossover district under\n\nSection 2 does not equate to freedom to ignore the reality of an existing crossover district in\n\nwhich minority citizens are able to elect their chosen candidates under Section 5.\n\n                  Since coalition and crossover districts provide minority groups the ability to elect\n\na preferred candidate, they must be recognized as ability districts in a Section 5 analysis of a\n\nbenchmark plan. Coalition and crossover districts that continue unchanged into a proposed plan\n\nmust be counted as well. Our recognition that crossover and coalition districts are ability\n\ndistricts in a benchmark plan is rooted in the fact that there must be discrete data, by way of\n\nelection returns, to confirm the existence of a voting coalition’s electoral power. For example,\n\n\npassage legislative history is a contradiction in terms. Any after-the-fact attempts to re-characterize the legislation’s\nlanguage and effects [cannot] be credited.” S. REP. NO. 109-225, at 55 (Additional views of Senators Leahy,\nKennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin). Second, as explained below, the statutory text\nand the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence regarding Section 5 make clear that crossover and minority coalition districts\nprovide minority citizens the ability to elect their candidates of choice.\n\n\n                                                           36\n\fevidence that a coalition had historical success in electing its candidates of choice would\n\ndemonstrate that the minority voters in that district had, and would continue to have, an ability to\n\nelect their preferred candidates. Proving the existence of a coalition district will require more\n\nexacting evidence than would be needed to prove the existence of a majority-minority district as\n\ndemonstrating past election performance is vital to showing the existence of an actual coalition\n\ndistrict.\n\n                  By contrast, a state creating a “new” crossover or coalition district simply\n\nanticipates, or hopes, that the minority population in the new district will align politically and\n\ncoalesce with other groups of voters to elect its candidates of choice. It would be extremely\n\ndifficult to confirm that minority voters would indeed have the ability to elect in the newly\n\nformed district.31 Since potential new crossover-coalition districts are “subject to [this] high\n\ndegree of speculation and prediction,” Bartlett, 129 S. Ct. at 1245, they can rarely be deemed\n\nability districts in a proposed plan.\n\n                           3. Retrogression in Proportional Versus Absolute Terms\n\n                  The Defendants argue that retrogression should be assessed on a plan-wide basis,\n\ncontending that a relative overall decrease in minority citizens’ share of electoral districts is\n\n31\n   Indeed, a state’s attempt to create future crossover districts may lead to the creation of “influence” districts that\nGeorgia v. Ashcroft approved and Congress rejected in the 2006 Amendments. In Georgia v. Ashcroft, the Court\napproved Georgia’s creation of new influence and coalition districts in proposed redistricting plans to offset the loss\nof majority-minority districts in the benchmark. 539 U.S. at 487. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that\nGeorgia had probably met its burden of demonstrating non-retrogression because its strategy of increasing Black\nvoting strength by “‘unpacking’ minority voters in some districts to create more influence and coalitional districts\n[was] apparent.” Id. As part of the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA, Congress rejected Georgia’s proposition that\ncreation of influence and coalition districts may be used to offset other losses of a minority population’s voting\npower, specifically amending Section 5 to “make[] clear that . . . the comparative ‘ability [of the minority\ncommunity] to elect preferred candidates of choice’ is the relevant factor to be evaluated when determining whether\na voting change has a retrogressive effect.” H.R. REP. NO. 109-478, at 46. The House Report to the 2006\nAmendments explained the “concern[] . . . that ‘[m]inority influence is nothing more than a guise for diluting\nminority voting strength’” and that “leaving the Georgia standard in place would encourage States to spread\nminority voters under the guise of ‘influence’ and would effectively shut minority voters out of the political\nprocess.” Id. at 45.\n\n\n                                                           37\n\fretrogressive. According to this argument, Texas’ failure to draw one or more additional\n\nHispanic ability districts in the Congressional Plan is retrogressive in the face of the Hispanic\n\npopulation growth in Texas that is in large measure responsible for the State’s four new\n\ncongressional seats. In support, they cite Georgia v. Ashcroft: “[I]n examining whether [a] new\n\nplan is retrogressive, the inquiry must encompass the entire statewide plan as a whole.” 539 U.S.\n\nat 479. But that language does not support the Defendants’ argument. It was speaking to a\n\nstate’s ability under Section 5 to offset the loss of an ability district in one area of a state by the\n\ngain of a new ability district elsewhere. Id.\n\n                 Texas relies on Abrams v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118129\"><a href=\"/opinion/118129/abrams-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997), which rejected the idea\n\nthat the addition of electoral districts necessarily requires the addition of minority ability\n\ndistricts. In Abrams, Georgia gained a single new congressional district because of a population\n\nincrease. This new district was not a minority ability district. The plaintiffs argued that the new\n\nplan was retrogressive because by failing to draw the new district as an ability district, the\n\npercentage of majority Black districts in the State decreased from ten percent to nine percent.\n\n521 U.S. at 97. The Supreme Court rejected the argument, stating that if it found retrogression\n\non such facts, “each time a State with a majority-minority district was allowed to add one new\n\ndistrict because of population growth, it would have to be majority-minority. This the Voting\n\nRights Act does not require.” Id. at 97-98.\n\n                 The United States distinguishes Abrams, relying on the substantial growth in\n\nTexas’ Hispanic population, Texas’ four new congressional seats (an unprecedented number for\n\nStates fully covered by Section 5),32 and the new provisions of the 2006 Amendments. It urges\n\n\n32\n  Notably, after the 1990 Census, Texas gained three additional congressional seats in response to which it created\ntwo new majority Black districts and a majority Hispanic district “with a view to complying with the Voting Rights\n\n\n                                                        38\n\fthis Court to limit Abrams to its facts, arguing that although a state need not add a new ability\n\ndistrict for each new district, under the facts of this case it was retrogressive for Texas not to add\n\nany new ability districts.\n\n                 This Court concludes that Abrams does not control. Although Abrams is clear\n\nthat the VRA does not require there to be a new minority ability district for every new\n\ncongressional seat, it does not hold that a state’s failure to draw new minority districts can never\n\nbe retrogressive. Nevertheless, this Court concludes that Texas’ failure to draw new Hispanic\n\nability districts to match the growth of its Hispanic population was not retrogressive. Section 5\n\nis limited to preventing “[s]tates from undoing or defeating the rights recently won” by\n\nminorities, Beer, 425 U.S. at 140 (quoting H.R. REP. NO. 91-397, at 8) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); it does not require states to add additional protections, id. (quoting H.R. REP. NO. 94-\n\n196, at 57-58) (internal quotation marks omitted), or to create new minority districts in\n\nproportion to increases in the minority group’s population. Id. at 137 n.8 (“This Court has, of\n\ncourse, rejected the proposition that members of a minority group have a federal right to be\n\nrepresented in legislative bodies in proportion to their number in the general population.”). Here,\n\nwhere Texas’ percentage gain in congressional seats (12.5%) is similar to Georgia’s percentage\n\ngain in Abrams (10%), we see no need to require of Texas what the Supreme Court did not\n\nrequire of Georgia.\n\n                 Although Texas’ alleged failure to account for the significant increase of the\n\nHispanic population in the State does not establish retrogression, it is relevant to the Court’s\n\nevaluation of whether the Congressional Plan was enacted with discriminatory purpose. A\n\n\nAct.” See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 957. All three districts, however, were found to be the product of an\nunconstitutional racial gerrymander. Id. at 979-86.\n\n\n\n                                                        39\n\fredistricting plan that does not increase a minority group’s voting power, despite a significant\n\ngrowth in that minority group’s population, may provide significant circumstantial evidence that\n\nthe plan was enacted with the purpose of denying or abridging that community’s right to vote.33\n\nCf. City of Pleasant Grove, 479 U.S. at 471 (“Section 5 looks not only to the present effects of\n\nchanges, but to their future effects as well . . . . Likewise, an impermissible purpose under § 5\n\nmay relate to anticipated as well as present circumstances.”).34 The Defendants are therefore\n\nincorrect as to the form, but not necessarily as to the substance of their argument. A state’s\n\nfailure to account for a minority group’s population growth that results in additional electoral\n\nseats, while not conclusive of an unlawful retrogressive effect under Section 5, may be\n\nnonetheless highly relevant and probative to the purpose inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n33\n  Based upon its identification of minority ability districts, the United States contends that nearly half a million\nHispanics would lose their ability to elect in the proposed Congressional Plan.\n34\n   In City of Pleasant Grove, an “all-white enclave in an otherwise racially mixed area of Alabama,” sought\npreclearance for the annexation of two parcels of land, one vacant and another containing a few white residents. 479\nU.S. at 465. The three-judge district court declined to grant preclearance, concluding that the jurisdiction had failed\nto demonstrate that the annexations did not have the purpose of abridging the minority population’s right to vote.\nThe Supreme Court affirmed the three-judge court, concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support the\nallegation that the city was annexing non-Black areas but refusing to annex Black areas. Despite the fact that there\nwere “no black voters in Pleasant Grove” and the annexations therefore could not have an effect on Black voting in\nthe city, the Court explained:\n\n                  [A]n impermissible purpose under § 5 may relate to anticipated as well as\n                  present circumstances . . . . Common sense teaches that appellant cannot\n                  indefinitely stave off the influx of black residents and voters . . . . One means of\n                  thwarting this process is to provide for the growth of a monolithic white voting\n                  block, thereby effectively diluting the black vote in advance. This is just as\n                  impermissible a purpose as the dilution of present black voting strength. To\n                  hold otherwise would make appellant's extraordinary success in resisting\n                  integration thus far a shield for further resistance. Nothing could be further from\n                  the purposes of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nId. at 471-72 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                           40\n\f                   C. Discriminatory Purpose\n\n                   Summary judgment is also not appropriate because Texas has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the Plans do not have the purpose of “denying or abridging the right to vote on\n\naccount of race or color, or [membership in a language minority group].” Texas argues that its\n\nlegislators had no animus towards any racial or language minority group but acted from purely\n\npartisan motives in drawing its redistricting Plans. Texas further argues that significant\n\nfederalism concerns would be raised if a federal court were to examine the actions of its State\n\nlegislature.35 The United States responds that a discriminatory purpose that violates Section 5\n\ndoes not always require an intent to target a minority group but can include a plan enacted in a\n\ndiscriminatory manner, even if designed to achieve a permissible aim.36 The Intervenors present\n\n35\n   Texas does not challenge the constitutionality of Section 5, see Complaint [Dkt. # 1], but relies on the\nConstitution as a shield. Texas argues that the 2006 Amendments only forbid states from making those changes that\nwould themselves violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection and the Fifteenth\nAmendment’s guarantee that the right to vote shall not be “denied or abridged by the United States or by any State\non account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” U.S. CONST. amend XIV, § 2; id. amend. XV, § 1. A\nsimple comparison of Section 5 and these Reconstruction-era Amendments shows that they do not track and Texas’\ncontention cannot be accepted wholesale. The Fifteenth Amendment does not protect language-minority voters and\nthe Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to a language minority qua language minority.

Thus, while both\nAmendments are relevant to the legitimacy of a redistricting plan as to other minorities, they are not determinative\nand provide only guidance as to language minorities, such as Hispanics.\n36\n  The United States cites Judge Kozinski’s opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in Garza v. County of\nLos Angeles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1990), for this proposition:\n\n                   Assume you are an anglo [sic] homeowner who lives in an all-white\n                   neighborhood. Suppose, also, that you harbor no ill feelings toward minorities.\n                   Suppose further, however, that some of your neighbors persuade you that having\n                   an integrated neighborhood would lower property values and that you stand to\n                   lose a lot of money on your home. On the basis of that belief, you join a pact not\n                   to sell your house to minorities. Have you engaged in intentional racial and\n                   ethnic discrimination? Of course you have. Your personal feelings toward\n                   minorities don’t matter; what matters is that you intentionally took actions\n                   calculated to keep them out of your neighborhood.\n\n918 F.2d at 778 n.1.\n\n\n\n                                                            41\n\fsome evidence supporting their claims of discriminatory purpose, but also suggest that further\n\ndiscovery is needed. At oral argument, Texas contended that, even if taken as true, the evidence\n\npresented by the United States and Intervenors is insufficient to prove discriminatory intent.\n\n                  We conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the\n\nPlans were enacted with discriminatory intent. As discussed earlier, the 2006 Amendments\n\nmake illegal any changes to voting qualifications, requirements, standards, practices, or\n\nprocedures that are adopted or pursued in order to deny or abridge the right to vote “on account\n\nof” a particular characteristic protected by the statute. 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a)-(c). As the\n\nSupreme Court reminds us in Arlington Heights, “Determining whether invidious discriminatory\n\npurpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct\n\nevidence of intent as may be available.” 429 U.S. at 266; see also Cromartie, 526 U.S. at 546\n\n(“The task of assessing a jurisdiction’s motivation, however, is not a simple matter; on the\n\ncontrary, it is an inherently complex endeavor . . . .”). Such an intensely fact-driven inquiry is\n\ntypically difficult to resolve at the summary judgment stage.\n\n                  The United States asserts that there is ample circumstantial evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory purpose with regard to the State House and Congressional Plans that raises a\n\ngenuine dispute of material facts. Likewise, the Intervenors challenge the Plans overall, their\n\ngeneral impact on Hispanic voters,37 the rushed sequence of events that preceded their adoption,\n\nprocedural and substantive departures from past practice, and treatment of specific districts and\n\ncommunities within each Plan.\n\n37\n   For example, there are allegedly no new Hispanic ability districts in the Congressional Plan, despite Hispanics’\nsubstantial population growth in Texas. The Gonzales Intervenors allege, however, that although Whites now\nconstitute 45.3 percent of the State’s population, Whites are a majority of the voting-age population in twenty-five\nout of thirty-six congressional districts, an increase from twenty-two in the benchmark.\n\n\n\n                                                         42\n\f                  Texas only countered arguments from the United States and those Intervenors that\n\nchallenge the State Senate Plan. In its brief and at oral argument, Texas offered three responses\n\nto Defendants’ claims of discriminatory purpose: 1) the State’s obligation to its own\n\nConstitution, which specifically bans unnecessarily dividing counties to form voting districts, see\n\nTEX. CONST. art. III, § 26; 2) political logic: Hispanics are Democrats, Democrats are the party\n\nout of power in the State, and, therefore, it is politics not illegal animus that accounts for any\n\nalleged circumstantial evidence of discriminatory purpose38; and 3) affidavit testimony by Texas\n\nlegislators and their staff that no discriminatory purpose was espoused by any member of the\n\nTexas Legislature, any staff, or anyone else when offering redistricting proposals. Yet Texas has\n\nnot disputed many of the Intervenors’ specific allegations of discriminatory intent. This Court\n\nconcludes that the United States and Intervenors have provided sufficient evidence to preclude\n\nsummary judgment and to require further review of the claims of discriminatory purpose directed\n\nto all three Plans.\n\n                                               IV. CONCLUSION\n\n                  Section 5 requires a multi-factored, functional approach to gauge whether a\n\nredistricting plan will have the effect of denying or abridging minority citizens’ ability to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice. It does not lend itself to formalistic inquiry and complexity is\n\ninherent in the statute. The ability to elect can rarely be measured by a simple statistical\n\nyardstick, as is the essence of Texas’ approach. Defendants also challenge all three Plans as\n\ndiscriminatory in purpose, but genuine disputes of material fact preclude summary judgment on\n\n\n\n\n38\n   But see Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. at 968 (“[T]o the extent that race is used as a proxy for political characteristics, a\nracial stereotyping requiring strict scrutiny is in operation.”).\n\n\n\n                                                           43\n\fthis record.
