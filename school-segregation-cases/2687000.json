Here,\nthe trial court failed to enter adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law to\n\nsupport the amount of its award of attorney fees and costs in favor of J.R. and\nDonna LeVassseur, the respondents in this matter. Thus, we must reverse the\n\naward and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n       On January 29, 2014, Thomas filed a lawsuit against her parents—the\nLeVasseurs—in which she sought to quiet title to real property located in Seattle,\n\nWashington. Thomas also filed a lis pendens.\n\fNo. 72496-7-1/2\n\n\n\n       In early March 2014, the LeVasseurs brought a motion for summary\n\njudgment. Therein, they requested an award of attorney fees, costs, and\n\nexpenses. In support of this motion, counsel for the LeVasseurs filed a fee\n\ndeclaration; an amended fee declaration was filed with their reply. According to\n\ncounsel for the LeVasseurs, at that time, the total costs and fees amounted to\n\n$25,280.50.\n\n       On April 17, 2014, the trial court granted the LeVasseurs' motion for\n\nsummary judgment, dismissing Thomas' complaint. In doing so, the court\n\nconcluded that an award of attorney fees, costs, and expenses in favor of the\n\nLeVasseurs was appropriate pursuant to either CR 11 or RCW 4.28.328(3).1\n\nFurthermore, the court found \"that the costs and expenses incurred by [the\n\nLeVassuers], including their attorneys' fees, were reasonable and necessary to\n\ndefend the lawsuit initiated by Plaintiff.\" Nevertheless, the court deferred entry of\n\nan order specifying the amount of fees awarded, noting that \"[t]his award may be\n\nreduced to judgment at Defendants' prerogative.\"\n\n       On April 23, Thomas filed a notice of appeal, wherein she sought review of\n\nseveral orders, including the aforementioned order granting summary judgment.2\n\nThat appeal has been resolved by separate opinion.\n\n       Subsequently, on August 26, the trial court entered judgment against both\n\n       1 This provision provides for the following:\n       Unless the claimant establishes a substantial justification for filing the lis\n       pendens, a claimant is liable to an aggrieved party who prevails in defense of the\n       action in which the lis pendens was filed for actual damages caused by filing the\n       lis pendens, and in the court's discretion, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs\n        incurred in defending the action.\n       2She also sought review of the \"Order Denying Plaintiffs Motion for Leave to Amend,\"\nwhich was entered on April 17, 2014.\n\fNo. 72496-7-1/3\n\n\n\nThomas and her counsel of record in the amount of $26,280. Additionally, the\n\ncourt noted that Thomas had not requested a stay of the enforcement of the April\n\n17 order granting summary judgment, and \"therefore concludes it is authorized to\n\ncancel the Lis Pendens.\" The court stated that Thomas \"must request a stay and\n\npost an appropriate bond to defer enforcement of the Court's prior decisions.\"\n\nThe court directed Thomas to \"file a supersedeas bond in the amount of\n\n$950,000 pending appeal,\" adding that the bond \"shall be filed by Sept. 5, 2014.\"\n\n      Thomas neither requested a stay nor posted a supersedeas bond.\n\nInstead, on September 5, she released the lis pendens on the property in dispute\n\nand filed a notice of appeal, seeking review of both the \"Order Granting\n\nDefendants' Motion to Enter Judgment and Remove Lis Pendens\" and the\n\njudgment entered on August 26, 2014.3 This appeal stems from the September\n5 notice of appeal.\n\n                                                II\n\n\n       Thomas contends that, even ifthe LeVasseurs were entitled to an award\n\nof attorney fees and costs, the trial court nonetheless abused its discretion. This\nis so, she asserts, because the amount awarded was unreasonable. We do\nnot_and, indeed, cannot—decide whether the amount ofthe award was, in fact,\nunreasonable. Owing to the absence of necessarily specific findings offact and\nconclusions of law, we cannot evaluate the propriety of the amount awarded.\n\n\n       3In her merits briefing, Thomas contends that the trial court erred in canceling the lis\npendens and requiring her to post a supersedeas bond. During oral argument, however, counsel\nforThomas conceded—and counsel for the LeVasseurs agreed—that these averments have\nbeen mooted by subsequent events. Accordingly, we do not further address them.\n\fNo. 72496-7-1/4\n\n\n\nAccordingly, we must remand this cause back to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n      Appellate courts exercise a supervisory role to ensure that a trial court's\n\ndiscretion in making an attorney fee award is properly exercised on articulable\n\ngrounds. Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 435. Therefore, such an award must be\n\nsupported by findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient to establish an\n\nadequate record for review. Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 435. \"Washington courts\n\nhave repeatedly held that the absence of an adequate record upon which to\n\nreview a fee award will result in a remand of the award to the trial court to\n\ndevelop such a record.\" Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 435 (collecting cases).\n\n       \"Courts must take an active role in assessing the reasonableness of fee\n\nawards ....

Such discounting is\n\nappropriate because \"[f]ees are not penalties, but rather a cost of litigation.\"\nAbsher Constr. Co. v. Kent Sch. Dist. No. 415, 79 Wn.

Given the\n\ncircumstances, the trial court's award must compensate the LeVasseurs for their\n\nreasonable expenses in defending against the claims associated with the filing of\nthe lis pendens.5 Because the claimant's liability does not arise until the lis\npendens is filed, the award cannot be based on any attorney work performed\nprior to that time.\n\n        While the trial court did enter findings and conclusions in this matter, they\n\nare conclusory. Hence, we are unable to ascertain whether the trial court\nconsidered any of Thomas's objections, which included averments that the fee\ndeclarations submitted by counsel for the LeVasseurs contained fees that were\nduplicative, excessive, and—importantly—unrelated to the filing of the lis\npendens. Consequently, we are unable to determine from the record whether\nthe award properly compensates the LeVassuers for their reasonable expenses\nincurred in defending against those claims upon which the filing ofthe lis\npendens was based.\n\n        On remand, it will be incumbent upon the trial court to make and enter the\n\n        4As explained by separate opinion, the award of attorney fees and costs was not\nsustainable pursuant to CR 11.\n        5Unlike CR 11, which permits the imposition ofmonetary sanctions for both\ncompensatory and punitive purposes, RCW 4.28.328(3) affords a court the discretion to award\n attorney fees and costs only for compensatory purposes.\n\n                                              -5-\n\fNo. 72496-7-1/6\n\n\n\nnecessary findings of fact and conclusions of law. The findings must indicate the\n\nmanner in which the court resolved disputed issues of fact and the conclusions\n\nmust explain the court's analysis in sufficient detail.\n\n                                           Ill\n\n\n       The LeVasseurs request an award of attorney fees on appeal. Where\n\nattorney fees are awarded at trial, the prevailing party may recover fees on\n\nappeal. RAP 18.1. Here, attorney fees were awarded at trial, where the\nLeVasseurs prevailed. As a partially prevailing party on appeal, they are also\n\nentitled to an award of attorney fees on appeal. To be clear, as against Thomas,\n\nthe LeVasseurs have prevailed on the issue of whether an attorney fee award\n\nwas allowable. However, Thomas prevailed on the issue of the amount of that\n\naward. On remand, the appellate fee award must appropriately segregate the\nwork performed by LeVasseurs' counsel as to the successful and unsuccessful\nissues.\n\n       The award of attorney fees and costs is reversed and remanded for further\nproceedings. In addition, the trial court is tasked on remand with determining an\nappropriate award of attorney fees on appeal, as it is in the best position to\nsafeguard against the risk of duplication or double recovery.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n          We concur:\n\n\n\n\n                                                          rjgckCfcV^\n\f",

Consequently, we are unable to determine from the record whether\nthe award properly compensates the LeVassuers for their reasonable expenses\nincurred in defending against those claims upon which the filing ofthe lis\npendens was based.\n\n        On remand, it will be incumbent upon the trial court to make and enter the\n\n        4As explained by separate opinion, the award of attorney fees and costs was not\nsustainable pursuant to CR 11.\n        5Unlike CR 11, which permits the imposition ofmonetary sanctions for both\ncompensatory and punitive purposes, RCW 4.28.328(3) affords a court the discretion to award\n attorney fees and costs only for compensatory purposes.\n\n                                              -5-\n\fNo. 72496-7-1/6\n\n\n\nnecessary findings of fact and conclusions of law. The findings must indicate the\n\nmanner in which the court resolved disputed issues of fact and the conclusions\n\nmust explain the court's analysis in sufficient detail.\n\n                                           Ill\n\n\n       The LeVasseurs request an award of attorney fees on appeal. Where\n\nattorney fees are awarded at trial, the prevailing party may recover fees on\n\nappeal. RAP 18.1. Here, attorney fees were awarded at trial, where the\nLeVasseurs prevailed. As a partially prevailing party on appeal, they are also\n\nentitled to an award of attorney fees on appeal. To be clear, as against Thomas,\n\nthe LeVasseurs have prevailed on the issue of whether an attorney fee award\n\nwas allowable. However, Thomas prevailed on the issue of the amount of that\n\naward. On remand, the appellate fee award must appropriately segregate the\nwork performed by LeVasseurs' counsel as to the successful and unsuccessful\nissues.\n\n       The award of attorney fees and costs is reversed and remanded for further\nproceedings. In addition, the trial court is tasked on remand with determining an\nappropriate award of attorney fees on appeal, as it is in the best position to\nsafeguard against the risk of duplication or double recovery.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n          We concur:\n\n\n\n\n                                                          rjgckCfcV^\n\f</pre>",
